    "text": "I just made my first trip to Park Bruges.  We were driving around Highland Park, looking at houses, and realized that a beer would definitely be a good thing right about then.    I've only been to Point B. once, (sister restaurant), it was crowded and too loud and I was in a bad mood at the time so I can't really say much about it as a comparison.   I think I was looking at houses then, too.  I've been looking at a lot of houses lately and I'm often not in a good mood afterwards.  I really don't think I want to own a house again.  But that's not what you are here to read, is it?  I will say that I left Park Bruges in a very good mood, which is a good sign for them as one comparison point.  The service was very friendly and they were knowledgable of the menu--both food and beer.  I thought the mussels were very good--we also had a Tartine that was tasty but could have been cooked a bit more.  The selection of Belgian Beers was more than adequate.     My only complaints are that 1) they need sun screens for the windows!; 2) it could be 'warmed up' a bit; and 3) it would be nice to invest in a sign for outside.  But if you need a nice, big booth, not too loud, and good food and beer, I highly recommend.",

It wasn't difficult to find parking, the service was great, and the atmosphere was quiet.  The food was really good, and the menu had some interesting options. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer because we were starving.  It was on the sweet side because of the figs and honey but I still enjoyed it.  I ordered the classic Montreal poutine for my meal and my boyfriend ordered the short rib poutine.  We both loved our meals! Also, considering that we needed boxes to take half of our poutine home with us, I would say their prices were reasonable; however, the menu overall is not cheap for lunch.  I would definitely recommend checking out the restaurant if you're in the area!",

    "text": "Two friends and I went to Park Bruges and ordered a smorgasbord of food.  Seriously, it almost didn't fit on the table.    But alas, let me start at the beginning.  Our wait was short, just enough time to grab a drink at the bar.  I couldn't resist getting a beer off of the extensive list, but my dinner mates each got cocktails (Beer Sangria!!) that were creative and tasty.  The bartender and hostess were very friendly.  We ordered the following (for real, it was just us 3, don't judge):  Tarte Flambee - classic version, the Cheese Board with chorizo, Asian Chicken Skewers, and Moules Frites - Spicy Creole.  For dessert we ordered these three cream puffs with hazelnut deliciousness inside.    My absolute favorite dish was the Moules Frites.  You CAN get great mussels in Pittsburgh!  The Creole version had Maytag bleu cheese that melted in your mouth.  The Frites were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  What a treat.  When I come again I'm getting this allllll for me!  My second favorite was the Cheese Board.  I'm a complete sucker for a good Cheese Board and this one had a great mix of cheeses, including one of my favorites, St. Andre's.    The Skewers and Tarte Flambee were good, although I found the Asian Skewers a bit out of place.  I actually liked the cucumber salad that came with it more than the skewers.  Still wonderfully tender, delicious chicken, though.  The Tarte Flambee was good but it didn't stand out after gorging myself on everything else.    Service was good, waitresses were attentive and friendly.    Best of all, our bill was surprisingly lower than what we were expecting.    I highly recommend Park Bruges...the dinner I had stands out as one of the best I've had so far this year.  I can't wait to go back.",

We only had to wait for about five minutes when we got there.  I think the food here is either a hit or miss. My friends and I ordered mussels and fries to share, and I ordered a vegetable frittata for myself. We ordered the classic white wine sauce for mussels and it was good as expected. The baguette that came with the mussels were a bit tough, but it wasn't rock hard. The fries are also delicious; however, compared to the fries at Point Brugge where the fries are short and stout, these are longer and thinner. The vegetable frittata of the day was roasted eggplants, tomatoes, feta cheese, and arugula pesto. The frittata itself was kind of a disappointment. It was very bland, and wasn't all that great. I won't try it again.  Other than the frittata, everything else was great.",

We got a bottle of wine to start the meal that was priced reasonably, and delicious. For an appetizer we split the Macaroni and Cheese with jalapenos in it. So savory and good!! The slight heat was awesome! I got the Steak Frites, and it was arguably one of the greatest steaks I've ever had!!! The fries were mostly likely the best ever! My girlfriend got a shrimp linguine dinner that was cooked to perfection! She loved it as well. For dessert we shared a chocolate waffle with homemade ice cream that was Carmel Salted Vanilla!! This made for a great conclusion to one of our first dates. We already have talked about going back soon. Park Bruges head chef, Chef Jason, came to our table to ensure our meal was up to his standards. A+++++!!! Park Bruges is perfect for date night, dinners, dinners with family and friends, and special occasions!!!",

    "text": "I like this location more than Point Brugge, because they have essentially the same menu but with less of a crowd. The mussels in white wine sauce are to die for, and they keep us coming back, but some of the other dishes are not as great. The roast chicken is delicious (beware: takes half an hour to prepare!), but the sauteed chicken breast is pretty much tomatoes with a side of tomatoes. I couldn't take more than a few bites before getting overwhelmed. So if you want the best thing on the menu, order the mussels in white wine sauce.  The service here, like at Point Brugge, is consistently very bad. I've had to wander around looking for the seating host/ess multiple times, and usually end up asking the bartender to point him/her out to me. Once we're seated, the waiter typically shows up once to get drinks, and if we don't order our food then, we will have to flag them down 15 minutes later--which is an ordeal in itself, as they are mysteriously out of sight 60% of the time, and chatting with other customers 30% of the time. I've seriously sat and watched our waiter have 15-minute long conversations about the weather with a customer at another table while we wait to ask for more water.  Anyway, we've come back here many times, which must mean that the great food is worth sacrificing service for.",

    "text": "Went here today for lunch after having been wowed a few weeks ago by Point Brugge Cafe. We arrived around 1 pm and there was a bit of a wait. It's Sunday, no big deal. After about 10 minutes we were escorted to our adorable mosaic tile table and handed a brunch menu. I wasn't expecting to have to order brunch since it was a little later, but there were lots of appetizing looking choices.  I wanted to try the frites, as I had read the reviews and you Yelpers consistently recommend them. We ordered some for the table as a started. They did not disappoint. I've never had frites that were that addictive! I think I stopped talking the moment they arrived, and didn't come up for air until they were gone. So perfectly delicious and the garlic dijion mayo was a perfect pairing for dipping...and I don't even like mayo! I ordered the Vegetable frittata of the day, which had Gouda, carmelized onions, tomatoes, and a heavenly pesto sauce. It was really tasty and fresh, and served with chilled fruit which was a nice light touch. I don't think I've ever had a better frittata. It was perfectly cooked and the quality of ingredients was apparent. My wife ordered the eggs diablo, which I obviously sampled. I really loved the sauce, but I'm not a huge fan of banana peppers so it wouldn't be something I would order. There were a few veggie friendly choices on the menu, so we had more than one option when choosing our lunch/brunch. The other folks at our table got meaty type dishes and raved about them.  The restaurant itself, like it's sister location, is adorable. It's a place where you instantly feel comfortable and you just know a special dining experience is awaiting you. I'm excited to come back and try that incredible looking banana nut french toast. And to try the dinner menu!",

    "text": "I brunch a lot. I am serious about brunch and having moved to pgh from phl I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find some great brunch places to fill the void. Luckily one of the first places I stumbled upon (with the help of google maps and yelp reviews) was Park Bruges. Situated on Bryant Street in Highland Park, they were right around the corner from where I stayed the first time I visited Pittsburgh. I feel pretty lucky to have this place be one of the first restaurants I've tried because it is so darned good.   This is a Saturday and Sunday brunch place which is super important to me, the idea that you can only brunch on Sunday is something that Pittsburgh has GOT TO STOP. It's the weekend? you should be able to brunch. End of story.  Their brunch menu is pretty big with lots of options if you're indecisive. They even have a prix fix option where you get a brunch beverages, brunch meal, and a side dish. I'm a big fan of their eggs benedict, steak and eggs, and brunch poutine (so decadent, and delicious).   If you show up at a few minutes before 11am (when they open) there is a line to get in, but if you are in that line you are usually sat immediately at 11 which makes it a great way to be sure you can get in. I also like coming up here because of their proximity to E2 and tazzadora (in case the wait is too long I like options!)  I've also recently had dinner here and I can admit that I was just as happy with that meal as I was with brunch (except that brunch is the best meal of the day and therefore trumps all other meals in my book regardless of how good they are).   Overall, it's fair to say that I'm a fan and will continue to be a fan so long as they continue to feed me delicious brunch foods and cocktails.",

It's a little out of the way from where I live and in the middle of a residential area but worth the effort to make a trip here.  This restaurant is a little larger than Point Brugge so I would anticipate a shorter wait.  The staff were really accommodating.  We had a very large group and after requesting a table for 8 to 10, we ended up with 14 people.   They made extra efforts to get everyone seats at our table and making sure we were accommodated.  With a group that large, I anticipated slow service and the food did take a while to come out and drink requests and refills were slow.  I imagine the service is much more personal and quicker for smaller groups.    I split the dinner moules frites (mussels and frites) in the spicy creole sauce with someone.   The sauce was nice and spicy and had great flavor.   It was great for dipping the bread they provide (which is a little on the crusty side) and gave a nice taste to the mussels.   With a lb and half of mussels, bread and fries, this dish was perfect for sharing.  They also have a good beer and wine selection and a nice bar area to sit at while waiting.",

I had several possible choices that made my mouth water but ended up selecting the Eggs Benedict with rosemary Parma ham with a chive hollandaise sauce. It was so good!! Eggs cooked perfectly, the sauce was filled with fresh chive flavor and was a fabulous accompaniment. My wife ordered the green curry mussels and the bowl was a rich bath of spicy broth and a generous serving of delightful mussels. I consider myself a mussels expert and order them whenever I get a chance and was SO happy to sample hers. Repeatedly! They were among the best I've ever had. The sauce was a delightful blend of curry spice with the distinct flavors of cilantro and basil. Yum. I wanted to stick my face in that bowl and lick it clean. Instead, we asked for extra bread and did it in a more civilized manner! But wow, was it ever good. The vegetable fritatta was really good and the baked eggs Diablo hit nearly every possible note you'd want in a breakfast entree - marinara, banana peppers, capers, and olives. I mean, what could be bad about that? It was super tasty. And oh yeah, those Bruge frites? Awesome. And yes, they ARE suitable for breakfast! I'll be back!",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite brunch in town!     Today's selection was the waffle with fruit topping.  The topping changes seasonally - this version was an amazing blueberry ginger, which paired great with two perfectly cooked Belgian waffles.   I did it prix fix brunch style, with a side of potato gratin and a bloody mary for $20.  The potato could have been warmer, but it was so rich and tasty that I didn't even care.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu, but gotta say that the waffles are going to be really hard to beat.",

    "text": "We decided upon Park Bruge for brunch. I have read so many wonderful reviews of the place. We arrived and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It was packed. Leszek ordered a bloody mary. I watched the bartender make it...he was very generous with the Absolute vodka. I ordered a California red wine.  Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgable, a bit frumpy, apparently you can wear whatever you want to work, but why not dress up a bit? I ordered Slow Roasted Beef Brisket Potato Hash sunny side up eggs, gouda cheese, horseradish sauce. $14 I also got a side of Creamy Polenta figs & candied walnuts. Cup $3.50 Leszek ordered Classic Steak & Eggs sunny side up eggs, horseradish cream, Bruges frites. $17  The side of polenta arrived before my meal. It was very good but only one very small piece of fig in the bottom. I was looking forward to more figs, so I was disappointed.  My entree arrived and I was very surprised at the minimal amount of beef brisket, it couldn't even have have been 2 ounces, again disappointed. The potato hash was good, fresh and from fresh potatoes, not freeze dried. The brunch comes with a chunk of baguette as well, its crusty and hard. No jam or butter.   Leszek's steak was supposed to be medium rare, it was beyond rare. He was okay with that but was not happy that it was so tuff. The waitress never checked back so he just ate it.....very slowly. If you are going to charge 17$, check back, make sure it is cooked the way the guest ordered it and make sure it is desirable.  I am not sure if we will return. For such a popular place, there should be a little more love in the food.",

I ordered the prosciutto and tomato sandwich. Decent sandwich. The tomatoes are sundried. Bread was a bit soggy. My brother ordered the leige waffles. For the record, they don't compare to Waffalonia's. The ones here were really dry. At that time, they also had this strawberry, chocolate french toast that were also extremely dry.  Still, this probably is a good brunch place. You just need to order the right things. Next time, will definitely order the mussels, poutine, and mac & cheese. Seems like it's what they do best.",

Double fried shoestring French fries they are always perfectly cooked. They also have a great selection of Belgium beers as well. The place never disappoints! Enjoy.",

The mussels from the Moules Frites were fine, and were on par with any other mid-range restaurant that serves mussels, and this dish also comes with a whole lot of frites too. We pretty much filled up on frites because they gave so much of it. Honestly, I did not come here to pay $50 to eat 2lbs of frites.

I may be a creature of habit, but this place is my Saturday morning (1 PM counts as morning if you're at brunch) for a reason, other than it being within walking distance of home. It fits my priority for bunch better than any other place:  I have to have a fruity bubbly with my sugar bread and not wait forever for it. I don't like the fuss of the nearby brunch spots; even their sister location in Point Breeze is tiny with a typical brunch wait (they also only serve brunch on Sundays). I have never waited for a table for the +1 and I on a Saturday morning. Never. That's insane in itself. Breakfast without a wait seemed like a dream only served on a plastic dish at Eat N Park. Nah, right here in Highland Park.  So I'm a loser and order the Liege waffles with \"seasonal fruit topping\" (blueberry ginger is my fav), gratin potatoes square, and a St. Germaine cocktail every single week. It's too good not to. The little waffles with the pearl sugar!? Ugh. The 1+ always gets the special, which has been anything from a Greek omelet to an Irish breakfast Ruben. I don't ask nor judge. He hasn't complained yet.  They also serve a really great lunch. Get the fries.  If you want brunch and do not want to wait \"about 45 minutes?\", this is the place to go. Even if they had a ridiculous wait like everywhere else I would probably still show up here.. Those tiny waffles (and full bar!!!) are that good.",

I am a huge fan of their moules & frittes, as everyone else is. (Although, if we are splitting hairs, I wish they would omit the cream from their \"Marniere\" sauce - it is quite nice without it at home...  Point Brugge was such a success, it was logical to have them expand out to a second location in order to accommodate their many fans. Service for us has always been spot on; the dishes come out hot, well-prepared, and with a smile. They have a great beer and wine list, and the overall experience and ambience is great. The remainder of the menu is also wonderful (try the rotisserie 1/2 chicken... delicious!) and well worth a try. Very nice restaurant for families - staff were friendly and helpful when we brought our little one along for the ride - she loved the food off the regular menu as well!  Pros: Everything on the menu Service  Cons: Can get somewhat crowded on the weekends, but that's to be understood! Parking is a little rough when the neighborhood is crowded at night",

I was actually planning to go to E2 for brunch on Sun., but my dining partner and I ended up here because the wait at E2 was running an hour at noon.  Here, we were seated within half an hour, which I appreciated, given the hectic nature of the PGH brunch scene.  I ordered the prix fixe brunch with the special of the day (pulled pork, cheddar, and onion omelette), potatoes au gratin, and a mimosa ($20).  I chose the special because I'm a BBQ aficionado, and I love me some pulled pork.  Between the pulled pork and cheddar, I expected the omelette to be bursting with flavor, but I found it rather bland.  I was also disappointed with the amount of pork in the omelette, which seemed rather stingy.  While I liked the flakiness of the potatoes (they were more akin to a casserole), I also found them bland, flavor-wise.  The part of the meal I enjoyed most was the mimosa, but to be honest, I don't have a standard of comparison, since this was my first time drinking one.  My dining partner enjoyed his grilled cheese, although it wasn't quite what he was expecting (he was expecting your standard grilled cheese).  While this wasn't a bad brunch, I doubt that I'd come out of my way to have it again, given that there are so many awesome brunch places in PGH.  For a similar quality brunch, I could have gone to Pamela's or DeLuca's, or gotten something more unique at at E2 or Coca (and paid less, to boot!).  If I were to come back here or to try Point Brugge, I think I'd stick to dinner so I could try the mussels and frites, since that's what everyone seems to rave about.  3.5 stars.",

    "text": "I was really excited to hear that they opened a sister restaurant to Point Brugge Cafe in a location that was more convenient to me.  This location is definitely spacier and more open than the one in Point Breeze.  The service is great.  Many of the service staff from Point Brugge work at Park Bruges.  The no-reservations rule still apply here and the wait is the same.  The style of the menu is similar but of course with different plates.  The food was good, but I would still prefer the cuisine at the older location. The frites are 10x better at Point Brugge than here.  Here, they are thinner cut fries and not as crunchy.  I had the Red Wine Braised Shortribs for dinner and though  it's good, but I didn't want to lick my plate clean like I normally do when I visit Point Brugge.  The moules are the same here.  One thing I really didn't like were the desserts, especially the souffle.  When you think chocolate souffle, you think of a fluffy and light pastry in a white ramekin hot from the oven seconds from being baked.  I anticipated getting this and digging my spoon into it and watching the pastry collapse into itself revealing the yummy goodness inside.  Well... It is a crime that here, they call their dessert a souffle.  It was more like a flourless chocolate cake.  There's nothing wrong with that, just don't call it something that it clearly isn't!  Disappointing!  The ambiance here is also different. Point Brugge is certainly livelier and more cozy, but I guess this place is more for bigger groups or families or if you prefer to be more than an arm's length from your fellow patrons.  All in all, a decent place to eat, but if I had to pick between the two Belgian restaurants in town, this wouldn't be it.  However, I would definitely return here.",

    "text": "My daughter and I went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was not crowded and it was shortly before the time when they stop serving brunch. Our waitress brought the brunch menu to us but told us that we'd better hurry and order in the next two minutes or we can't get brunch. When we asked to see the lunch menu, she said, I'll give it to you but you are going to have to wait a while before they start serving lunch. We ordered brunch and were served the food but not once did the waitress check to see how we were doing. We had to flag another server to  get us condiments and to ask for our bill. She finally brought our bill and then we had to wait until she finished her conversation with the bartender. I could understand the neglect and the wait if the restaurant was busy but it was not even 1/4 full. Normally, we like the food and are happy with the service but this waitress was terrible. I only wish I had her name. When we were leaving, we had to exit through the side door because my pregnant daughter was on crutches. I went ahead of her to get the car and they could see she was struggling to open the door but three servers and the bartender ignored her so that they could continue with their very important personal conversation. Incredibly rude.",

We enjoy Park Bruges a little more than Point Bruge, simply because it is physically more comfortable and easier to have a conversation with your dinner companions than at it's sister location. While we have eaten there numerous times, who says things can't get even better. This visit rose above the others. The mussels had a new preparation, curry. Delicious, we had to order extra bread [fresh with a crispy crust] and spoons so we could all sip on the broth after the mussels had disappeared. The best was yet to come: Striped Sea Bass, with polenta/artichokes/tomatoes. I am very picky about how my fish is prepared. I don't want it to be dry. The waitress and I talked about the fish and how I liked it to be prepared. She coached the chef, and he or she hit it spot on! It was one of the best restaurant prepared pieces of fish I've ever had. I grew up in a home that great food was expected and good food seen as a disappointment. I didn't expect this fine of a preparation. Also the polenta was creamy, well seasoned and artichokes/tomatoes added texture and taste.",

    "text": "Since its opening in Point Breeze, I've been a big fan of Point Brugge Restaurant.  When I heard that the owners and chef of that establishment were opening a new place in Highland Park, I was excited to try the food.   We arrived at Park Bruge close to 6pm, and there was already a nice crowd.  Clearly, the word had spread that good food was being served in the Morningside/Highland Park area, and loyal patrons to Point Brugge (located in Point Breeze) , as well as newbies were already enjoying the fare.  Although Park Bruge had only been open for a month, it was already starting to attract a loyal following.  Decor/Ambiance   Park Bruge restaurant isn't overly-decorated.  There is a large window on the front of the building that let's passers-by know that there's something going on inside.  At present, there's no sign either; but this didn't seem to dissuade people from finding its location.   Upon entering, you will see a small bar on the right hand side- during our visit it was crowded with hungry customers waiting for a table, as well as people enjoying good Belgian beers and imported wine.    The interior can best be described as modern, and understated; a perfect combination for a place that serves simply prepared clean food.  There is ample lighting, but things aren't too bright, which means you can read your menu without having to find your glasses, or a spare flashlight.  Tables and booths are carefully arranged in the dining room providing plenty of room for the wait staff and patrons to move about. Food We got a few beers, and looked over the menu.  Of course we ordered the mussels which arrived in a thing garlicky broth, and fresh bread.  The mussels were fresh, and tasted like the ocean.  My dinner companion asked, \"Where else can you get mussels this good?\"  I didn't have an answer.  We devoured or seafood, and listened to our server tell us about the specials.  One of the items was a striped bass; not something you see on most menus in the Pittsburgh area.  Although it sounded tempting, I ordered a burger with cheddar and homemade coleslaw.  We also chose the seared pork chop with potatoes, tomatoes, and gingered apples.  Our dinners arrived within minutes, and we quickly dug in.  The burger was good (just like those at Point Brugge).  The coleslaw was fresh, and not gooped-up with extra mayonnaise.  The portion was a nice size, but not too big; perfect to satisfy my appetite.  The beef was seasoned, and cooked to my specifications.   The pork was succulent and not over-done.  If you've had moist-free pork chops in the past, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the tenderness of these chops.  The chived-mashed potatoes were creamy, and there was a nice hint of ginger that complimented the natural sweetness of the pork. Service The service at park Bruge was stellar.  Our every need was met with a smile, and the waitstaff was courteous and competent. Cost Prices at Park Bruge are reasonable.  Appetizers start around $8.00. Entrees begin at the $12.00 to $14.00 range, and can go up to $28.00 depending on the nightly specials. Conclusion The owners of Park Bruge clearly have another hit on their hands.  A combination of talent in the kitchen, an excellent selection of Belgian beers and imported wines, and a fun environment will surely have hungry patrons coming back for more. Chef Chuck Kerber",

    "text": "Finally, finally, finally, Park Bruges is open! They did a soft opening last night (1/28) that I heard about through a mailing list, and we hightailed down there right after work. I'm glad that we did, because by the time we left at 7 or so, the place was packed.  For those of you who are familiar with Point Brugge, this restaurant does a great job of capturing the same vibe. The booths and tables are spaced so that the cafe has a cozy feel, but you aren't right on top of each other. The bar still dominates the front of the house, which is great for those coming by for a quick drink/snack or for waiting for a table (though there is a small waiting area as well, unlike at Point Brugge). The menu has many familiar items, but also adds some new dishes to the mix (more on that below), and the food is clearly made from fresh ingredients, and is well prepared and delicious. Even though the servers are still learning the menu a bit themselves (like I said, we went on opening night, and a \"soft\" opening at that), they are enthusiastic, friendly, and very helpful.   For those not familiar with Point Brugge, Park Bruges is a Belgian-inspired restaurant, with the feel of a neighborhood cafe. The menu includes traditional Belgian fare, such as moules (mussels) and frites (fries) that are cooked to perfection. They also offer salads (some of which change seasonally), burgers, and typical continental European fare, sometimes with a bit of a twist. They have also added some other dishes that seem to be inspired by Alsace-Lorraine. I ordered a garlic soup and a traditional tarte flambee for dinner, and both were incredibly authentic in their flavors (I lived in Metz, France, for a while). Other dishes at our table include a burger (cooked to exactly the right temperature), a spinach salad with salmon, grilled cheese with tomatoes and rustic bread, and two plates of the frites. All of the food was just right - not too heavy, and not too skimpy, with great flavor profiles even for simple items (like the burger). We also ordered some profiteroles with caramel and ice cream for dessert, which looked great. Unfortunately, I was unable to taste them for this review, because my children inhaled them all in about 30 seconds!  As you would expect from a Belgian cafe, the beer selection was excellent, both on tap and in bottles. The Trois Pistoles and Corsendonk were our favorites (both on draft). Park Bruges also has an extensive wine list, and a very creative selection of cocktails.   Right now, the posted hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 11AM until 10PM (9PM on Sunday). The restaurant is closed on Mondays. Brunch is served until 3PM on Saturday and Sunday (unlike the Sunday-only brunch at Point Brugge).  In summary, I recommend Park Bruges very, very highly. (In fact, I finally stopped just reading Yelp, and set up an account, just to post this as my first review.) Park Bruges is a huge asset to the Highland Park neighborhood, and I know that it will soon be come a destination restaurant for those outside the neighborhood as well, just like its sister venue, Point Brugge.",

At most restaurants I only find two items that are healthy that I would like. Here I was shocked at how many options on the menu qualify ... even whole grain grilled cheese with tomatoes for my child. Things were both healthy and delicious too!  I had a salmon omelet of the day and my hubby had a sausage sandwich with an egg on it. I love eggs, so I think I could eat here every day!  The atmosphere could qualify as romantic or social depending on the time of day.  And there was great art work on the walls giving it a very modern feel, mixing nicely some old looking touches with great art work.    I also drink a lot of water at meals.  I loved that they had a bottle of water in the middle of all tables... and it was a neat bottle... kind of looked like an over sized wine bottle with a top that would go on and off... hey, it's all the finer details!",

    "text": "Sure, the moules are good. However, I have two major complaints: 1, An estimated wait time of 45min on a Friday night at a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations isn't a big deal. What is annoying is when that 45 min turns into almost 1.5h as it did for our party. I understand that the restaurant can't control some variables (like how long diners will remain at their tables) but they given the obvious success of the establishment they should either accept reservations or expand. 2. The frites were absolutely disgusting. I've had frites before (in France admittedly, not Belgium), and I don't think they should should be entirely comprised of the burnt, crunchy ends of the fry as ours were. They looked and tasted like the greasy mess that's likely present in deep fryers at the end of a shift. Given the classic combination of moules with frites there's no excuse for messing this up. Overall, recommended with reservations.",

    "text": "First night of serving on Friday night!  My wife and I happened to drive by and noticed the front window jammed with people waiting for tables.  After months (more than a year?) of delays, the sister restaurant to the legendary Point Brugge Cafe (Point Breeze) has finally opened.  Grand opening on Tuesday 1 February, but a \"soft opening\" was announced to the Highland Park neighbors earlier this week.  As you might expect if you've ever seen the reviews of Point Brugge Cafe, Pittsburgh now has another terrific fresh-food restaurant!  And another feather in the restaurant cap for Bryant Street and Highland Park.  The decor is contemporary -- sleek and simple -- but very comfortable.  It's a boisterous place (some might call it \"noisy\") so if you're looking for dark, quiet, romantic dinner, this ain't the place for you.  If, however, you're looking for great food in an energized environment, this could your new dining \"home.\"    I wish I could offer a more extended sense of the menu, but my wife and I both ordered the same thing.    We started with a potato/pancetta soup.  It was broth-based, but with just a touch of cream to hold it together.  Light and delicious.  Our entree: herb-crusted salmon over arugula and lentils.  In spite of the fact that we ordered the salmon well-done (not fans of raw fish), the salmon was moist and tasty.   The arugula and lentils were wonderful.    For dessert, we shared an order of profiteroles: three crisp, hollow rounds of pastries filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate and, I believe, a bit of caramel.  Again, very flavorful.   Not a fan of chocolate, but whatever they drizzled on the profiteroles was particularly tasty.  For fans of Point Brugge, the menu includes the steamed P.E.I. mussels and Belgain-style twice-cooked fries with seasoned mayonnaise.  (The family at the table next to us went through two orders of EACH!)  The service was very good even though it was the first night with customers.  I was told that the cafe hired EXPERIENCED servers, host staff and bartenders.  Congrats to them for thinking through this.    To repeat: another tremendous addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and ESPECIALLY to fans of good, fresh food who live in the East End.  My only disappointment was that I couldn't get an espresso after dinner.  Only traditional American coffee (though it IS PrestoGeorge coffee).  No big deal, though, as I can always wander around the corner to Tazza d'Oro on Highland Avenue.  I didn't pick up the phone number or find a Website for the place.  I hope that other Yelpers can supplement this soon.",

Easily the best beer I've had in the past 10 years. The Moules frites are not to be missed, they were wonderful. The Eggs Benedict was also very tasty. Some day I should move to within walking distance of the Park Bruges Cafe, and eat there at least 52 times per year. Well actually the only thing that might stop me is that there is sometimes a line to get in, but it's worth it.",

The staff was amazing and friendly and also explained their brunch offers for the day. All the food that came out looked and smelled amazing.   I opted for the Prix Fixe Brunch Option and chose the open BLT sandwich with maple-bourbon house cured bacon, the potato gratin as a side and and the house mimosa! The mimosa, delicious and so refreshing; the potato gratin was absolutely amazing and I am sad I couldn't finish it all!   The open BLT sandwich was really good too, the flavor combinations were fantastic, I loved loved loved the smoked paprika aioli, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the bacon! I have never had maple-bourbon cured bacon and was excited to try. But, unfortunately the bacon was really dry and chewy and did not have much taste to it! So I didn't finish it. Even though the bacon should have been the highlight of the dish, I still didn't miss it too much as all the rest of the flavors were really good. I would definitely give them another try as I loved not only the atmosphere but the presentation of the food, the friendliness of the staff and the overall feel to this place.",

    "text": "Several years ago, I tried Pointe Brugge for the first time, and Park Bruges had been on my restaurant wishlist ever sense. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, the hubby and I decided to finally check it out.  I was delightfully surprised to see that the restaurant wasn't completely packed on a Friday night - probably because it was the day after Thanksgiving! - and we were given the last two seat table. Neither of us were very dressed up but felt comfortable in the traditional style restaurant among other patrons wearing jeans and even sweatshirts.   Our waitress came and checked on us pretty quickly and consistently popped over throughout the evening. We both ordered beers, and I went with a delicious Belgian on-tap high-alcohol-content offering. I wish that I remembered the name because it was heavenly (especially to this Belgian beer-loving girl).  We started with the Slow Roasted Shortrib Poutine per the recommendation of our waitress who did not steer us wrong. The mixture of the shortribs with the gravy was absolutely heavenly. For our entrees, I selected the mussels with green curry sauce while my husband went with the Jamison Farm Lamb Shank. The mussels were well prepared and the sauce was tasty, but the curry heat began to build up for me and became a bit too powerful for my taste. I had really enjoyed the red curry at the sister restaurant Pointe Brugge and felt that the green curry here was spicier. My husband's lamb was delicious. He quickly ate the lamb, the side sweet potato and brussel sprout hash, and even finished my mussels for me, drowning the bread in the green curry sauce to soak up every bit of flavor.  I'm so happy to have finally tried both of these cousin restaurants and am very pleased with both of my dining experiences. Based on proximity to my home, more attractive interior decor, and that magical red curry sauce, I think that I will likely be going to Point Brugge more frequently than Park Bruges in the future.",

    "text": "I think this is the restaurant I've been to the most in Pittsburgh. Some of that is the convenience. I can walk here, but I really enjoy the food too. It gets pretty crowded and unfortunately they don't take reservations. When the weather is nice, there is usually a line when they open for brunch, and they have outdoor seating, but only 3 tables so if you want one, get there early. Or, they do take out, so if you want a lazy day on the couch with delicious food, you can call in your order and pick it up to avoid the crowds.   The absolute best thing on the menu is the mussels. They are so good and they usually have 3-4 different flavors you can try. I love the classic white wine sauce, but they also have a green curry, which is delicious and slightly spicy. You also get french bread to soak up all the yummy sauce when you're done. They have two sizes of mussels: 1 pound or 1.5 pound with fries. The fries are really good and crispy. They're just seasoned with salt, but the crispiness and large flakes of salt are what make them so good.  I enjoy their prix fixe brunch special. Tasty mimosas and my favorite is the crab cake eggs benedict. Eggs benedict is my favorite brunch dish and the crab and spicy hollandaise work really well. And as weird as it sounds, the best brunch side is just their bacon. Nice and thick, with the right amounts of chewy and crispy. I really want to buy it to cook at home.  The decor is a little boring but seats are comfortable and I'm always so focused on the food and conversation that I don't mind the simplicity. It gets a little loud in there also, but I can still hear my table's conversation, so that's okay too.",

    "text": "We headed out to Park Bruges for my bff's birthday last night....her and her husband have been here several times and invited us along, our first time at Park Bruges. And I have to say, it definitely lived up to the reviews!   We got the Poutine - fries with cheese curd and stock gravy - and the Tarte Flambee - a kind of flatbread (I think?) with marinated tomatoes, olive oil, and cheese -  to share as our apps. Very good! I have to say I've heard nothing but good things about the Poutine, which was delicious. But I actually preferred the tarte. It was light and tasty - a nice appetizer. For our entrees, my husband got the mussels with the green curry sauce and I had the cafe chicken sandwich with a salad and champagne vinegarette (a suggest from my friend). Everything was very delicious.  It's hard to complain about this place, because honestly, there's so much to love. If given the opportunity, I'd give Park Bruges 4.5 stars. Just not quite 5. I'm just going to be a little picky, since all of the reviews are so good and there's little to complain about. My chicken sandwich was very good...chicken was flavorful and the mozzarella and dried tomatoes made the sandwich. But, the bun was just a little too crunchy for my liking, so I ate half the sandwich then took the other half of my chicken and mixed it in with my salad.   The only really negative thing I can say about our first experience was our service. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice, she just really didn't have any sense of urgency. Drinks and refills took several minutes and we had to ask for an extra set of silverware, since there were only 3 on the table. Overall, like I said, she was friendly, just not very efficient.  The restaurant itself is cute. The place is small, but that doesn't bother me. We sat inside, and the restaurant is very comfortable, although it did get quite loud the busier it got. There is minimal seating outside, which is a bummer because I love to sit outside and eat. The problem with sitting outside, if you choose to do so, is this. They don't take reservations. So, if you end up going at prime time, people are sort of just hanging around at the bar or outside, which means, if the latter, people waiting for tables are sort of just hanging around in front of your table while you eat. Could be a little awkward. My suggestion would be to go a early like we did (6pm) or a little later, say after 8 or 8:30.",

We started with the classic version of Tarte Flambe (the version with the ham). This flatbread was phenomenal and it was hard to share because I'm sure everyone wanted the whole thing to themselves. The hubby ordered Bay of Fundy Salmon and I, the Moules Frites (classic white wine). Although the salmon was nothing all too special, the mussels were so worth it! Amazing, I tell you. I love that they also give you a French baguette for dipping. I've ordered mussels frites at other places in town that don't include bread. You need something to soak up the sauce! I hope to make it back soon to try more items from the menu.",

The hostess seated a 4-top that arrived after us, before us. Probably wouldn't have noticed if the 2-top hadn't been sitting empty for a good 10 minutes.  Our server poured one glass of water and left the other empty once we sat down. He rarely checked in on us.  It took us a good 20 minutes to get a bloody mary and a mimosa.  During our appetizer our server would check on the tables beside us but barely glanced our way.  Ordered our food 25 minutes later.  Our entrees came out a good 5-10 minutes apart.  The one redeeming thing about the service was that he noticed when our water pitcher was empty.  Even then, it took him 10 minutes to get it refilled.   Basically, our server was awful.  We love the food at Park Bruges and have been here multiple times.  Giving two stars because the food never disappoints.  The service was absolutely terrible for no reason.   They were faster with the check than they were with anything else.",

I was a bit taken back by the menu since to be honest it wasn't untill then we realized we were definitely not in the burger place we thought we were. (apparently there used to be a burger joint across the street but it is now something else) The only burger was a lamb burger and yeah.. no thanks.. the only things to me that seemed somewhat appealing were the \"grilled cheese meal\" and \"mac & cheese meal\". So I ordered the grill cheese and hubby had the mac... everyhting to this point was good, and even though the menu was certainly not our cup of tea, we could have lived with it and who knows maybe if we saw their regular menu instead of the brunch, we may have had a diffent opinion ... But then the food came. .  My grilled cheese was about the size it would be  if you made a grilled cheese out of piece of bread for  bruschetta. With a side of some interesting coleslaw. The mac and cheese looked better and thats about where the enjoyment stopped. The mac & cheese tasted really old or just made really cheaply and someone mixed in some pepperoncini juice. If we were at some kind of dive bar and thd food was super cheap, we wouldnt have been surprised but we weren't. The bartender was super nice,  even though we didn't really complain except when I asked if this was the normal size of the grilled cheese and she replied yes!  Either way considering what you pay, in our opinion its not worth it.",

    "text": "As we walked to the car and began to get in, my H held the door open as I rolled in.  He closes the door and gets in the driver side, when I state \"better hurry to the hospital the baby is coming.  Let's call her Mussels.\"  I had done it again.  Ate until I was so stuffed it was unpleasant, but if you asked me if I regret it I will say \"nope!\"  I do get overzealous when it comes a new place that I haven't been to, all I want to do is try everything that looks good without regard to my personal wellbeing.   So the food, we ordered a classic poutine, the Bruges Burger prepared medium, a LB of mussels spicy prepped, and a few drinks.  I explained to the H that the Poutine was his but I wanted to try it thus making him the main consumer so I wouldn't eat too many.  Well that didn't work as planned.  Upon delivery I fork dived in and got a huge amount of fries, curds, and gravy.  Simply divine!   He got the burger to which I had to try.  Really very good, and I ate his side salad, lovely dressing.  My mussels were very creamy and brothy I simply loved them but felt something was left off.  The bartender offered extra bread to sop up extra juices that I gladly accepted.     Now this is a shame to say about what should be a 5 star place.  The restaurant was just confusing.  You walk in and there is no hostess there.  No sign saying please wait to be seated, no just people loitering around I was like what are we supposed to do???  So there is a small bar real close to the door so with the fear of waiting forever we seized the two open seats and decided to just eat there.  Bar has no TV, and the Bartender was as slow as molasses. Absolutely no sense of urgency.  She was nice, and knowledgeable if you could get her attention.   The food was EXCELLENT!  But I am upset that I ordered the spicy mussels and thought the whole time these are not spicy... Very good but not spicy.  My H kept saying it was probably b/c I always like stuff extra spicy and have a high tolerance.  I kept saying no my mom who can't eat anything with spice would eat this no problem.  But having never been there I thought it was just how they served it.  That was until the check came.  Another episode of a bartender not writing down an order and rang me in for the classic and not the spicy.  A little too late to complain and they were really good still but, I really wanted the spicy ones!  So the service was meh.  It took her 10 minutes to even wait on us because she had one speed, the I don't give a sh*t speed.  Still would totally come back!  Those mussels were to die for and next time I will know what to expect if I get the wrong ones.",

We all ordered mussels and when the food was relieved, we discovered a hair on of the the plates. This is bound to happen in even the best restaurants and our server immediately took the plate away. Within minutes the manager was at our table with sincere apologies. After our meals, she stated desserts were on the house for everyone.   All of the desserts were amazing, and I will definitely be back to a restaurant that values their customers as much as Park Bruges does",

I had the beef shirt rib and found it to be very flavorful and tender. I am a sucker for beef though so perhaps I am bias. My wife had the steak frittes and really enjoyed it. The place isn't huge and seemed very busy for a Wednesday night. The weather was good though so the patio helped turn the people out a bit quicker. I couldn't imagine going in the winter unless you had made a reservation (if that is even an option). Long story short I think it was worth the wait. Will return again some other beautiful summer evening.",

The restaurant we planned to visit (on our list of must-try) had a 1-hour wait, so we checked out this nearby restaurant. My daughter ordered the Citrus Ricotta French Toast. It was OK, but lacked sweetness. The fruit sauce of raspberry-passion fruit was tart when a little sweetness would have been welcome with this dish. Fresh fruit of cantalope, honeydew, pineapple, grapes and strawberries accompanied this. The melons being out-of-season now were without flavor and did not compliment the dish. This was something we would not order again. I ordered the Baked Eggs Cassoulet which was excellent with the taste of one of my favorites, bean soup. The eggs added to the idea of a brunch item. We also ordered the Classic Montreal Poutine to share. This is a dish we would order again and again with perfectly fried potatoes, just the right amount of gravy and cheese curds. We scarfed them down neglecting our other food since the poutine would not be good for take-home. We plan to return here to sample some other things like the Brunch Burger, Southern Style Crabcakes or my standby weekend brunch item, Eggs Benedict.",

Now that we live in Highland Park, and 2 blocks from Bryant St., we go almost every week.  To start, the wait is usually long. They don't accept reservations, so don't go here if you're looking for something quick. Do check it out if you want to taste the best mussels I've had in Pittsburgh. You're almost immediately greeted by the manager/hostess and put on a seating list. Grab some drinks at the bar, or if you prefer, run next door to a local bar for a few beers.   I HIGHLY recommend the house salad- the champagne vinaigrette is AMAZING and will make even the strongest hater-of-salads sing a different tune. Any of the appetizers are worth a shot, but our personal favorite is the mac&cheese. It's creamy with a hint of spice.   For dinner, hands down the moules frittes. Our personal favorite is the classic white wine, although we've tried every option. Get extra bread for dipping, and maybe a spoon. The sauce is THAT good. The fries are crispy and totally worth the calories you consume. If you have room for dessert try the flour-less chocolate cake.  Good food, good service, good price... 2 blocks from home... can't get much better than that!",

I will say their potato gratin is a must order on the size every single time. They have specials everyday and they always make my mouth water.

THE FRIES WILL ELEVATE YOUR SPIRIT TO A WORLD OF PURE FATTY BLISS.   Their brunch menu is great with a wide range of good options and a nice pre-fixe menu that comes with an entree, side, and a brunch cocktail. The brunch poutine will also keep you full for a week.

Having been here and to the sister restaurant before I once again held high hopes and was not disappointed.  The decor of the restaurant is nice with a lot of open space and seating which is good since it  seems to fill up quickly.  We arrived at 11, their opening time, on a Sunday and within a few minutes the restaurant was almost full.  By the time that we left almost an hour later there was a fairly big wait for a time.  For brunch I ended up ordering the omelet of the day which had barbeque pulled pork, jalepeno cheddar cheese and onion.  Now that may sound a little weird but It was easily one of the best omelets that I have ever tasted in my life.  The BBQ sauce was of the Carolina variety, so a bit vinegary which fit perfectly against the spiciness of the cheese.  By the end I felt like I had almost eaten a very good pulled pork sandwich which in my opinion is perfect for brunch.  My dining companion ended up getting the tarte flambee.  It was a very interesting dish that almost ended looking like a flat bread pizza but was also very tasty.  The bottom line for me is that the food was fantastic and I will definitely be back in the near future!",

Every entree, we had Steak Frites, cooked just right, Chicken Milanese which made us actually stop and say \"Wow!\" Creole Shrimp and Grits, and Gemelli pasta, was delicious. Portions were generous. Somehow we made room for dessert, cheesecake and apple tartine...apple melted in your mouth. Food done right! The service was friendly and helpful.

Curiously, the strange garnish of raw carrot slices was under the steak.  At $17, this hurts.  My friend's poutine was nothing to write home about, but at least was edible. Greyish chunks of short rib sitting in lukewarm gravy with unmelted cheese curds didn't impress us.  Maybe this was the kitchen's B team? That or they were hung over.  Server was friendly but absent during our entire meal. He catered to the couple next to us and bafflingly enough, a three year old boy who wasn't enjoying whatever his mom ordered, but not two thirty year olds with spending power.  Only when we asked for the check did he ask if we were enjoying our food. Apologizing for the steak but offering a free drink \"next time I'm in there\" was a funny non-consolation since a. I don't live in Pittsburgh and b. I'd never come back if I was, so I'll give him a star for that.",

The burger is always perfectly done and the bread is fresh, with a perfect crust. Everything above and beyond that just makes it all the better.   Though the draft list is small, their bottle selection is substantial and varied. They have great wines available and the atmosphere is vibrant -- for lunch or dinner.   Going for dinner? Get there early or get ready to wait.",

Both of them are phenomenal. It's plates licking good! Belgium waffles reminds me of the waffles from wafflonia.  For dinner, I came with bunch of friends. We ordered many things to share. We got the mussels with classic wine sauce, yum I don't even like mussels but because of their sauce I had two :-p we also dipped the French bread with the classic wine sauce, and ended up having two bowls of bread. Yum, the sauce is so tasty. We also got cheese plate, which is small to share with five people. It's more suitable for two or three people. We also got the frites, salmon, and their ribs. Wow everything was amazing. The portion and the price were pretty reasonable too. We were one of the last ones to leave the restaurant, we didn't realize they were already cleaning up already. They did not rush us at all and were still filling our water. The waitresses here are so friendly. I am now a big fan of Belgium food! Thanks park Brugge",

    "text": "We brought our Pitt girl here on Family weekend and were all very happy with Park Bruges' awesome Saturday brunch.  The three of us were drawn to their  crab cakes Benedict with creole hollandaise.  The 2 crab cakes were generously sized and topped with perfectly poached eggs, smothered with hollandaise all on top of a slice of challah-- delicious!  -- though I was slightly disappointed there was no hint of any creole spiciness.  Next time I would just ask for Tabasco. Also shared a single Belgian waffle, served with both blueberry ginger compote and chocolate sauces on the side:). I've never had a True Belgian waffle so don't feel qualified to comment on its authenticity, but thought this was not very special in taste, tho the presentation and sauces were excellent. Service was awesome, prices reasonable for the food.  We didn't partake in the brunch prix fixe deal, which includes a mimosa, Bloody Mary or another (I forget) boozy alternative as well as an additional side order...   Next time!!",

    "text": "To start off it's been a while since we've gone to the sister restaurant Point Brugge for brunch but I distinctly remember them having a French toast on the prix fixe before.  I could have guaranteed if they had that this time around at the Park my wife would have ordered that.  Highland Park is different from Point Breeze but it didn't change the fact that there was a little bit of a wait since this place was also very popular as well.  We seemed to be the first in line right after the entire restaurant had been completely seated.  We had a wait but it wasn't that long at all, about 20 minutes or so.  We could have been seated right away at the bar but we preferred to wait for a table.  We had each gone with a prix fixe two of which were the brisket hash and I had the original Benedict (with ham).  I had the Benny with crab cakes last time and it was ok but I just felt like having ham this time around.  The sides were bacon and a cup of yogurt.  The drinks were samosas and one Bloody Mary.  I had ordered a side of Bruges Frites too.  I was pleased with my Eggs Benny.  The ham was very tasty and overall it was a filling brunch.  The bacon here is so good.  It's thick cut and very smoky.  It does not seem like your everyday grocery store bacon at all.    The \"fries\" are very good but very salty.  It's a funny joke my friend and I have about frites vs fries.  Frites are served with some sort of aioli instead of ketchup and because of the name they are more expensive.  This place fit that cliche to a tee.  They are fries... by any other name.  They also have poutine here which to me is funny to see.  Usually nice sit down places that serve mussels don't serve poutine.  Poutine where I come from are a fast food and they are EVERYWHERE and anywhere you can order fries (not frites) the option for poutine is automatic.    Brunch here is nice.  It's sort of expensive but it's a treat.  If you weren't going to have alcohol it would be more realistic... but hey Bloody Mary for brunch.  It's what makes a difference between breakfast and brunch.  Legitimate brunch = cocktail of some sort.  I can now say that both the Park and the Point are legit for that AND they are both good and nice for brunch on a Sunday.",

    "text": "Park Bruges is a simple restaurant. They don't put much effort into aesthetics but they do put a lot into the quality and taste of their menu items. Yesterday was my second time dining at Park Bruges. My boyfriend and I ordered the charcuterie board, green curry mussels, Bruges frites, and the crab cake po boy. The charcuterie board was good overall; we enjoyed all the meats except one that was a bit too salty for us. The (delicious) Bruges frites are listed under \"Small Plates,\" but the portion was quite large. They fill a regular plate up with fries and it is served with aioli. The crab cake po boy was a little sweet, which my boyfriend enjoyed more than I did. But the best part of the meal were the green curry mussels. While the mussels themselves were average to good, the green curry sauce was AMAZING. It is probably the best sauce I've ever had with mussels. The mussels were obviously delicious in them, but I also loved dipping the bread into it as well as the fries, and, honestly, I also just drank it straight out of the bowl. The flavor was perfect and I couldn't get enough of it!  Taste | 4.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4",

    "text": "Park Bruges has been on my brunch to-do list for some time.  I was meeting a friend on Sunday morning hoping to bribe her into being my petsitter with a great meal on a beautiful day.  Park Bruges did the trick.  I was expecting a wait of around 30 minutes minimum given our prime brunch time arrival (just before 1pm) but since this particular Sunday was the running of the Pittsburgh Marathon and Bryant Street was part of the route, we only waited minutes for the hostess to clean off one of the outside tables.  It was a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we enjoyed the weather and rooting on the final runners as we dined.  When I went inside to ask the hostess about sitting outside, I saw the daily beer bottle special was Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout.  I ordered one as soon as we were seated and greeted by our friendly and personable waitress.  Deciding on food was a bit more difficult.  Everything sounded delicious and I had been looking over the menu online the day before but still couldn't make up my mind.  After our waitress approached us for the third time, I went with my gut and ordered the Open Faced BLT and a side of Bruges Frites.  My dining partner went with the prix fixe brunch option of Beef Brisket Potato Hash, Granola and yogurt, and Mimosa.    The beautifully structured creation of maple-bourbon house cured bacon, sunnyside up eggs, tomato, and arugula on ciabatta drizzled with smoked paprika aioli makes you remember why brunch exists.  Those frites with roasted garlic dijon mayo didn't hurt, either.  If I wasn't such a lady, I may have also devoured my friend's main course.  That beef brisket potato hash is made with gouda and horseradish sauce topped with sunnyside up eggs.  It should be no surprise that when our waitress asked if we wanted dessert and we didn't really answer yes or no, we opted for a delicious chocolate cake (I think she mentioned something about Bailey's when she explained the dessert options) to end a perfect meal.  I could not have imagined a more perfect day.  The only reason I deducted one star is because I felt the brunch was a little pricey.  Our two meals (with drinks and dessert) came to $65.  I don't mind a splurge every once in awhile and on this particular day it felt worth it.",

An extra table was brought up and we continued brunch. We felt so welcomed despite our group arriving separately and having some young talkative children. It's experiences like this that unfortunately are lacking more and more. By the way, the chicken waffle (a quarter round) was amazing. The brunch poutine was to die for (their sausage gravy was amazing but no biscuit and gravy option, but it's Belgian right? I'll deal :)  We paid on one bill, which is how it should be (kids) and tipped appropriately.   The service stole the show, which made the somewhat pricey menu worth it. Every penny.",

I ordered a selection that came with sunny side up eggs and honestly don't think any egg should be eaten with the white uncooked because I find it disturbing....but more power to those who can! Ordered them over easy instead. They came out a second's worth of cooking from being over hard. A waste of a good egg also in my opinion. I need it to be cooked white with yellow nice and runny. The perfect over easy egg. So I sent them back. Came out less than 3 minutes later.... Hmmmm. Obviously on these and first attempt the grill was way too high with crispy edges to eggs. Their second try it appeared they turned them over for just long enough to not be called sunny side up because when I cut into them the white below the surface was clear and runny.  Ok. A lot of dialogue for eggs, but if you're gonna serve brunch have someone in the kitchen who knows how to cook eggs!  Today wasn't that day apparently. Sent my meal back (and did not order anything else) but did enjoy my Mimosa!",

Mussels are not fresh and are overcooked. It's a testament, unfortunately, to the relative immaturity of the Pgh dining scene that this place still gets great reviews.",

I even had my frites laying helplessly in pools of their friends' - the mussels - green curry. No seriously, that was a great decision - putting the fries in the mussel sauce, that is! Not going to lie, the frites were not the most impressive iteration of the potato that I've ever had, but they were a nice psychological flotation device to have on hand when I started to panic and think I was too deep in fancy waters. Having said thaaaat, this restaurant is gorgeous! Nicely lit, lovely location with a quaint view from the ginormous windows at night. The standing bar was a bit too close to the sitting bar, as my group found out when we were asked to violate the fire code by waiting there until our table was ready, but I doubt this is frequently a problem - the restaurant is rather small for its popularity, yes, but we went on a rainy day, so the outside option was unavailable. The service was also excellent (our server, at least!), and, I'm not sure if it is their dress code...literally....but all the servers were wearing cute little dresses that were all different, but all attuned to the ambiance of the place! (Oh, and they were all female, hope that helps in your visualization.)  Everyone at our table got something different, including the day's special (which was juicy, juicy duck with grilled seasonal vegetables), french onion soup (which I hear was delicious, but did not try), salmon (which was literally phenomenal), and a tarte flambee (which I also did not try...starting to see the new gluten-free trend?). That didn't even slow us down! Next up was the strawberry shortcake, which I was assured was tasty, and the gluten free chocolate cake, which is stuffed with a delicious cream that CHANGES FLAVOUR EVERY DAY. Changes. Every. Day. And the gluten free chocolate cake stays the same! Which is good, because that thing was perfect. I will be back. For that. Every day?",

Living in the South Hills, we typically make the journey to Highland Park on Saturdays, so we are most familiar with the weekend brunch menu.  We have never had a bad experience here.  It's hard to try everything on the brunch menu because the specials are so tempting or we often re-order the items we've found that we really like.  My wife usually gets the Omelet of the Day since they are so varied and delicious.  My favorites in order of preference from the brunch menu are steak and eggs, slow roasted beef brisket potato hash, and open faced BLT.  On the dinner menu, the Gerber Farms roasted half chicken is worth the time needed to prepare.  Of course, the frites and mussels are always recommended.",

I have eaten here twice now, and while it's not as crowded (major plus), I still prefer the original in Point Breeze.  The menu is very similar (almost a little too similar) to that at Point Brugge. A notable addition is the tarte flambee, a French-style flatbread. Very good (I got the classic preparation, with ham, caramelized onions, and creme fraiche) but nothing mind-blowing. I'd get it again if I was sharing with a group, but I wouldn't find myself craving it. They also have poutine, which I have yet to try, but the frites with roasted garlic aioli were just as good as their Point Brugge counterpart. I actually think I may prefer the aioli to the basil mayo!  As for the mussels, which are always a must, I had to try the new preparation with Maytag Bleu and Andouille Sausage. Again, liked it, but mind wasn't blown. Same goes for the macaroni gratin--Point Brugge just does it better. For those who live in Highland Park, this is a great addition to the neighborhood. As for me, I can't say I'll be abandoning my favorite spot to eat anytime soon.",

The atmosphere - clean and contemporary.  Some people might find it a bit too sterile, but I thought it suited well for our meal.  The pricing is pretty good - it's a little on the higher end in my opinion, but it's WELL worth it for the amount and quality of food.  The service - excellent service.  As someone who worked as a server for years, I'm pretty critical of waitstaff when I go out to eat.  They didn't disappoint.  The food - Absolutely insanely delicious.  I did their prix fixe brunch which was eggs benedict with rosemary ham, potatoes au gratin, and a mimosa.  The portion was pretty large, but not so large that I couldn't finish it.  Every bite was incredible.    Overall - I'd obviously recommend this place.  I have only been there for the brunch so I'm not sure how other meals stack up, but it's great for a weekend morning.

My only problem is trying to decide what to choose from the menu; I'm always torn and then end up getting a familiar favorite I don't want to miss at the expense of venturing into a new selection.  I have always gone for lunch, so I can't comment on the waiting time at dinner, but 1:00 pm is a great time to go; they are pleasantly busy, but you don't feel rushed to eat and leave. If you have an afternoon to spare, it's a good place to relax and linger over a long lunch.",

    "text": "Went back for dinner this past weekend and was a bit less impressed.  The moules frites left me extremely satisfied and were quite tasty.  My glass of wine was a measly 3-4 oz.  Seriously?  I easily paid for your cost of the bottle of wine in one glass... you can spare another ounce or two.. geez.  Also, my partner got the southwest veggie burger.  The texture was pretty mushy and sad and the poblano pepper was unseeded and EXTREMELY HOT.  To the point of inedible.  When we mentioned this to the server she just kind of shrugged her shoulders, did not offer to send it back, so my partner had to scrape pretty much all of the burger toppings off to make it edible.  Anyhow, we'll probably go back.",

    "text": "Enjoyed dinner here for the first time since the opening, and YUM.   The restaurant seemed to be pretty crowded, but the host did a fantastic job of traffic control and really had people moving in quickly as tables were vacated. Our server was quick and friendly, and my seasonal draft beer (Penn Brewery Chocolate Stout) was fantastic.   Partner and I split the tasty classic poutine, and then each had sandwiches (me: Southwest veggie burger, him: chicken sandwich). Both were good, but not as good as the poutine.   My advice: get here early or late on the weekends, because the place isn't huge (though bigger than its sibling, Point Brugge) and I don't think they take reservations. The waiting area is pretty small (and right in front of the door), which led to some folks waiting in the vestibule. The bar area is sort of cramped and busy, meaning that if you can't grab a barstool, you're likely to be blocking traffic and moving out of the way quite a bit.    Try the poutine and the beers on tap. I'm definitely coming back for a tarte flambe!",

As the neighborhood I grew up in, HP has always been a great area, but spots like Park Bruges are really making it a destination.

Like it's sister location, Park B offers great food, great service and a great atmosphere - Pretty much all you could want in a neighborhood restaurant.",

While it has the same vibe as Point Brugge, I found the food didn't taste the same.  The white wine sauce was much more saltier and less flavorful.  It was a sharp salty taste that I couldn't get pass.  It didn't enhance the moules like it should have.  Frites were the only thing that was good.  Staff isn't as friendly or quick as Point Brugge.  I think the only benefit to going here is that you don't have to wait around for a table as much.  I think I know why though.",

    "text": "*Homer Simpson drooling sound*   Park Bruges is a total success!  The space is wonderful & inviting.  The layout is nice and open, and it seems like there's more tables than at Point Brugge.  We were told a 45 minute wait on Saturday night, but didn't wait for more than 20 - 30 minutes.  The dress ranged from very casual to a little dressy.  The hostess and waitstaff were all efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable.    The beer selection is ample and varied, with many high ABV options.  There's about 5 beers on tap, and too many bottles to count.  I had a Three Philosophers quadrupel, and my friends had a brown ale from local Full Pint Brewing Co and a Ephemere lambic from Unibroue.  Our beers ranged from about $6.00 - $7.50.  The food was spot-on.  We started with the Classic Montreal Poutine.  The gravy was more of a chicken gravy, which surprised me and others who'd had poutine before, but it was still delicious.  We continued with the Moules-- one classic and one with andouille sausage and bleu cheese.  Both were delicious, though the flavors in the latter are more robust than the light white white/herb sauce.  The moules didn't come out with any bread, which was disappointing, but I'm sure you could ask for some.  I had the sea scallop fettuccine.  Ample sea scallops perfectly seared with a light-ish sauce and large green and red peppers.  We were all too stuffed for dessert, but I might try their chocolate martini next time!  Also, I think on my next visit I'll do more of a small plates/family style dinner rather than order entrees.  I love that I have the 2 dining options at one establishment.  Little trivia: They used the Flemish spelling for Point Brugge and the French spelling for Park Bruges since both are spoken in Belgium!",

My special was phenomenal and fresh and so delicious. Husband's burger was good, but not worth the amount he paid. I think we'll go back again, but choose some less expensive options.",

Went in on a recent Saturday night at about 8:30, were told there would be an hour-and-a-half wait, and waited about 45 minutes.  On this trip I focused on trying all of the things that were new on the menu.  We got the poutine, which could hardly be anything but delicious with those fries and cheese curds from Arsenal Cheese in Lawrenceville.  I also had the garlic soup, which I was really excited about, but didn't love.  The soup was monotonously starchy, with little to break it up or add interest, and even the cheese on top failed to excite.  We finished with a large order of the mussels, the new spicy Creole preparation with andouille sausage, peppers, onions, celery and crumbled Maytag Bleu.  These were very good, though I am sure I will order my traditional white wine order next time. Ah, we are creatures of habit!    The decor is, True, sterile and, ok, a bit bland, but in a clean, modern way, I thought.  It's hard not to compare this to such a memorable predecessor, and it's not exactly the same, True, but this is still a fine restaurant and worth a visit.",

    "text": "Last week I looked for somewhere close to my home in Morningside for a casual but edible (read: not bar food) dinner with my boyfriend, J.  We did not have reservations at Park Bruges but were able to get a table, albeit indoors, around 8p.m. on Saturday evening. Loud with bustling conversation, but not rambunctious drunkards, it was difficult to hear each other and perhaps would have been worth trying to make a reservation outdoors or waiting for an outdoor table.  I've been to the sister restaurant, Point Brugge, but J has not been to either.  I am an extremely picky eater and usually tend toward safe restaurants with somewhat simple menus; J was thrilled to see that Park Bruges offered (reasonably-priced) mussels on their menu.  He chose the spicy creole with sausage and even convinced me to try one, though it was hard to taste it under the spiciness-- he, however, loved them and sopped up the extra sauce with the great crust of bread that accompanied his meal.  It may go without saying that the bruge frites on the side were devoured between the both of us.  I opted for a lighter appetizer of the (original) Tarte Flambee but was a bit nervous that there would be too much creme fraiche, leaving the tarte soggy.  My worries were assuaged as soon as I saw the tarte.  The cheese did not overpower the other toppings; in fact, the carmalized onions comprised the majority of the tarte-topping.  As someone with a small appetite, this was more than enough food for a late dinner; the leftovers were still crisp yet not-too-dried-out for breakfast the following morning.  My only complaint would be that the restaurant seemed slightly understaffed, as our waitress was tending to nine tables, both indoor and out; she did not take our order or deliver our check until prompted by us, which I always hate to do when a server is so busy.",

The food: Parmesan & Herb Biscuits  I will preface this by saying I was fortunate enough to date a girl from the mid-west once who was an amazing cook that made the best biscuits and sausage gravy I've ever tasted to this day - so I have high standards.  The good: Portion size somewhat in line with the price tag. Eggs and biscuits were well done. Didn't skimp on the amount of sausage in the gravy.   The bad: Bland. Meh all over again. Despite all of that suasage the gravy was still surprisingly void of any flavor. More black pepper may have helped, but wouldn't have completely solved it.   In the end, after years of watching, I can simply do better at home. Lastly, as others have commented, it gets LOUD in here, not my cup of tea as far as atmosphere goes. Not likely to return.   Meh.

My SO and I shared a cheese board (+chorizo) and moules frites (white wine sauce) and we were really happy with our meals. Although the food portion was big, we were so happy that the meal still felt light and didn't make us feel sluggish after eating a lot of food like we typically get at other restaurants.  Of note..try dipping and asking for extra bread to eat with the white wine sauce that is left over after eating all the mussels in our moules frites...it was divine!! I really loved our meal here!! The prices were also very reasonable. They aren't on the cheap side especially when compared to Pittsburgh establishment...but they are still very reasonable!!  Check it out if you are looking for a place to dining over great conversations with friends and families. I wouldn't mind being back here again for sure despite the fact that I'm not usually a drinker either!",

I mentioned to her that Park Bruges was close by and all of a sudden she couldn't stop thinking about Park Bruges mussels.  We ended skipping pho and we immediately drove to our favorite restaurant Park Bruges.       We have been here many times but I haven't written a review yet for them.  This place is just us.  My wife always get's their mussels and I order their Bruges Burger.  Her mussels come with frites and my burger comes with a salad.  So we just switch and she gives me her frites and I give her my salad.  That's a happy marriage!  Anyways I love this burger.  If you want to read more about their mussels check out my wife's review (Carrie W).  She says they are the best mussels in the Burgh.         I usually order my burger medium.  My only complaint is sometimes it does get a little greasy on the bottom of the bun but the bun does hold it all in.  It doesn't get soft.  The burger comes with shredded short ribs, gouda cheese, green peppercorn mayo.  This is my favorite burger in Pittsburgh.  My wife usually orders a IPA from their draft list and I usually get a Belgium or German bottled beer.       On other visits we have tried their poutine and it is very good too.  Now a days we are just too stuffed to have their poutine and finish our dinner.         If you come here on a Sunday or right before 5pm you usually can easily get a seat.  After 5 it does get busy.  There is a bar here and no television.  It's just a nice causal place that has good service and great food.",

Street parking is available during the day provided you follow the rules on the sign.  When I arrived the place wasn't too busy. They have a full bar and seating all around it. The place did fill up during the course of my visit. If you are planning on eating lunch you will be given huge portions! My waitress told me that the soup of the day was a creamed cauliflower and broccoli. If you order a sandwich it comes with a heaping helping of coleslaw. They also have full size salads.  I noticed that they have a lunch special of 1/2 sandwich and a cup of the daily soup for $9.00. I saw they have a specially prepared French onion soup that sells for $6.50 for a bowl. If you want it as a cup then you must do the lunch pairing for a slight upcharge. If you do the combination then you won't get the coleslaw.  My food came out rather quickly but I must say service is very slow since I only saw two waitresses there and one manager who asked how my food was. It took a while to get my iced tea refilled but they finally obligized.  In spite of the delay the food did not disappoint. I loved the chicken half sandwich and the French onion soup was to die for!  This alone is worth having and in the future I'd pair it with a small plate.   This is a great place to eat but it does fill quickly. They do need another staff waitress to handle to amount of people that come in. Located near Food glorious food on Bryant St in Morningside it makes a great place for lunch, dinner or even brunch.",

    "text": "While the chorizo omelette chilaquiles style was delicious and creative, Park Bruges is far too expensive for the quality, quantity, and service offered.  The meal was tasty and savory, but what takes it down two stars is 1) for service and 2) for price.  However, if you have no qualms about spending whatever money you want, certainly come here for tasty but small food portions. And you can and should stop reading if you don't care about money or aren't constrained by a budget ! The profit margin for the meal I ordered must be huge for the price. Probably two eggs, 1 oz of chorizo, assorted veggies in the omelette, 8? Tortilla chips and 1 tablespoon of salsa verde $14. Then, the service was mediocre. If having a high price ticket for brunch, the server was often gone for long periods from the time we arrived to ordering to getting the check settled. We got there as soon as it opened as well, so it wasn't too packed.  Parking is easy, and the ambience is nice.",

Park Bruges specializes in Belgian  beers, and they are well known for their mussels. But there's a lot more here to appreciate, including consistently great food and a friendly neighborhood vibe that will keep you coming back. Same owners as the popular Point Breeze location, but a larger establishment with shorter lines.   We tried the Flemish onion soup, and it is extraordinarily satisfying. I had the Shrimp and Grits, which was prepared with Southern authenticity.   Top it off with friendly and knowledgeable service and you have a real winner.",

It was nearby and we were scheduled to arrive right when it opened. Luckily they had one outdoor table open which we promptly snagged.  Service was a bit spotty in the beginning, although we noticed the place filled up shortly after we arrived. It's harder to grab the servers' attention when outside, so keep that in mind if you're sitting there.  We decided to do a family style meal and ordered the crab cake eggs benedict, their chicken and waffles special, the breakfast poutine, and the ricotta donuts. It took about 15-20 minutes to get our food, but it was all served at the same time and wow oh wow, what a spread! Just the picture of these items is enough for a good rating. But I was even more blown away by the taste.  I went for a donut first and bam! I knew we were in for a treat. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, they were the best textural experience. The dipping sauces were also perfect, chocolatey for something heavier and a fruity strawberry rhubarb for something lighter. Both sauces weren't too sweet, which I really appreciated, and they didn't feel too heavy as donuts normally do.  The breakfast poutine was very well made. The fries were fried very crispy, and the presentation was beautiful. To be honest though, I didn't love the sausage gravy. The flavor was a bit flat and after the fifth or sixth bite, it felt a bit boring. Something herby or a bit of kick I think would've helped.  The crab cake eggs benedict, wow. First off, beautifully arranged; I didn't want to disturb it. The colors of the hollandaise down to the fruit made it quite the portrait. The egg was perfectly poached and that bite with everything on it was just incredible. Good flavor, great texture, and all around one of the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The challah was also a nice, deliberate touch.  The chicken and waffles weren't as pretty but equally tasty. The cheddar chive waffle batter was no joke. The cheesy, oniony flavor really came through and paired so well with their fluffy buttermilk fried chicken counterpart. I believe the cut was a boneless chicken breast, but it wasn't dry whatsoever. The final touch, the habanero honey, sealed the deal. You got sweet, salty, fluffy, crispy, meaty, and cheesy flavor explosion with a little kick in one bite. Game over.  Prices are what I'd expect for brunch, ($13-16 per entree), and despite the average service, the food and environment were phenomenal. I would highly recommend a weekend brunch here if you get the chance.",

Grabbed a late night delish dinner with a dear friend to catch up with a decades worth to talk about! The waitress at first wasn't too friendly but in the end she was aware of our chattyness, she was giving us space! Smart lady.. I had the Honeycrisp Apple and Blue Cheese salad, with a side of Bruges Frites aka, fancy fries!.. my friend got the Bruges Burger.. all just so yummy. For one I am a big fan when a restaurant is generous on the lost cost foods like fries. These were delightfully skinny, how I wish that was my waistline but when you indulge in fries what can I expect?? We finished with a decaf coffee fresh made just for me by the attentively kind waitress. Loved the ambiance that was relaxed, refined and comfortable. It felt like being in a bistro with your mom's love. I want to come back to try more of the entrees. Great vibe and great food.",

I ordered the Tarte Flambee which was huge (ended up taking half of the tarte home and topping it with two more eggs for breakfast the next day) and a side of liege waffle because those are the best waffles known to man. Per the servers suggestion I had it topped with chocolate but next time I would opt for syrup. Beautiful presentations and I loved all the variety on the menu.

Aside from being comfortable, consistent, and a safe choice for any group of people you might eat out with, I'm always impressed with their Belgian beers, well-priced and non-overwhelming wine list, and rotating soups and specials. The staff is always excited, and the atmosphere is good for family, dates, friends, or even just a casual drink and small bite.  Obviously, the mussels are top-notch, but I've also been satisfied with anything on the menu, from the Mediterranean Platter to the Bruges salad (with beets and Beemster cheese) to the short ribs and everything in between. They don't take reservations, so sometimes you end up waiting, but it's tough to get comfort food this good anywhere else.",

    "text": "This is tough! I don't know whether I prefer Point Brugge or Park Bruges..Well, truth be told, I like them both for their own separate reasons. Same but different in their own ways. While we've been to Park Bruges only once, we've been to it's sister restaurant many times.   Park Bruges is a bit more contemporary and doesn't have the neighborhood feel that Point Brugge does, however, the food is exemplary as well as the service. While we were waiting for our table, we stopped each had a drink at the bar. I had a LaChouffe and she had a mixed drink which was very good. While lingering at the bar waiting for our table we noticed how good the food looked and obviously that just whet out appetite.   As per usual, we felt the need to share an order of the mussels and frites. You just simply can't go wrong with the classic white wine broth. The mussels were cooked perfectly and were very clean(little to no grit). The fries...well, both Park Bruges and Point Brugge have this mastered. They're perfect. The problem with the mussels is we want to eat a loaf of bread to make sure we sop up all of the bread. Yes, the carbs are worth it.  For dinner I had the Chicken Milanese which was basically a mixed green salad piled on top of some of the crispiest chicken I've ever had. The lemony breading on the chicken is just exceptional. The one gripe I have with the chicken is that it's pounded very thin and could lead to potential over cooking and a very dry piece of chicken. The dressing on the mixed greens was very nice. I couldn't quite tell what it was, but it was a vinaigrette and it was very nice. The greens, tomators and other veggies were nice and crisp.  She had the special, which was a Bluenose Bass with asparagus and tomato risotto. She loved it. The fish was so meaty it cut like chicken. The tomato risotto was perfectly cooked as was the grilled asparagus. I sampled a little but of everything and while I do not normally eat fish, I would eat this fish.  We also had the Lemon Roulade to go. By far one of the best desserts in Allegheny County. The sauce is exceptional, the cake is moist and delicious. Get one.   The one thing I want to point out is that while you may have to wait, it seems tables turn fast, and that's not a bad thing. Will definitely be back to Park Bruges!",

    "text": "\"If I was born on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I wasn't and I'm not, so it doesn't\" -Colin Farrell, IN BRUGES  I must respectfully disagree Mr. Farrell. Park Bruges thoroughly impressed me with their variety of classical Belgian dishes, friendly and competent staff, cozy location and impressive beer list.  My ever present girlfriend and I met a few friends at Park Bruges one Tuesday evening for some dinner. It was a beautiful night so we opted to sit outside (it was also the only remaining four top in the restaurant). Since we were the second to arrive, our friends already had a table outside. Therefore, I will refrain from reviiwing the atmosphere inside the actual restaurant for the time being. I am going back so look for it in either another review, or an edit of this one. What I did see through the large picture window looked like a cozy little place with a nice bar and seating for maybe 40.  To lead off any good meal, I think you need a good beer. Park Bruges certainly comes through in that department. While their draft selection is a little limited, they more than make up for it by having a very, very nice selection of bottles, both Belgian and craft/import. This is a big plus for my friend, Jon, a Belgian beer nut, who likes Park Bruges even more than I do. While I respect the Belgian ales, and do partake on occassion, I like a greater variety than the yeasty sweetness you get in those particular styles, and the melange of other options pleased me greatly.  The service was very good also. Our server was nice, attentive, and informative, a great combination for a waitress. She always made sure our glasses were never empty, our old plates were always quickly whisked away almost as soon as we were done, and we always had plenty of fresh bread. This is very important as you will see in a minute.  On to the main event, the food. I went there expecting to get a nice meal, maybe an appetizer, dessert, and main. That all went out the window when I saw the menu and wanted everything on it. That's usually a good sign so I went with my gut (literally, I was starving) and loaded up on slald, soup, fries, a burger, mussels, and dessert. Yes I am a fatass, but at least I am a happy fatass.  For the salad I got the regular house salad tossed in a champagne vinegarette. Overall, I remember it being a good salad, but the other items I had kind of overshadowed it, so sorry I can't be a little more detailed. As my salad was coming out, my friends were getting their onion soups. One look and a whif later I am chasing down the waitress to get one for myself. One of the better ideas I have had in some time if I may say. It came out piping hot, like a good onion soup should, and somthered in creamy, melty,emmental cheese. The apples they put in it kind of threw me through a loop, but it was a good loop to be sure.  The next item I got was the PEI mussels in a classic garlic, onion, white wine, and cream sauce. They mussels were cooked well so they were firm, but not rubbery. The sauce they were in was the True star of the dish. I was a little thinner than what I would have made myself, but it tasted fantastic. This is where all that extra bread came in handy. They didn't even need to rinse the plate after I got through with it.  For dinner I got the Bruges Burger with coleslaw and an order of the pomme frites. The burger was cooked medium rare, like I like it and the shredded short ribs mixed with the creamy gruyere was a delightful little pop to the sandwich. It was a good burger, not the best I have had, but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. The fries were also done properly as well. They were double fried and seasoned well (take note Pittsburgh, crispy, salty fries are invading and I am telling them where to find resistance fighters) and the garlic mayo added the perfect bit of zazz to go with them.  For dessert we had a stout infused Belgian waffle with a homemade chocolate-candied walnut ice cream. It was good, and a manager told me it was an experiment, but I felt it fell a little flat. The stout just made the waffle taste burned, but the ice cream, the truly good part, covered up the flavor well. I would liked to have seen perhaps a fruit sorbet with the stout waffle, or maybe a Lindeman's Framboise, or Kriek infused waffle with the same ice cream.  All said and done, I really enjoyed my visit to Park Bruges. I wish that I could have rated them higher, but it was just a few flaws that kept them out of the top slot. I gave them the \"Yay, I'm a fan!\" rating because the one or two little misteps kept them out of the realm of \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\". Park Bruges may not be as good as it gets, but they are pretty damn close. I look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "Went to Park Bruges for brunch today with the family.  Got there at 11am when they opened and there was already a crowd gathering to get in.  The space is significantly more open than the claustrophobic cramped space of their sister restaurant Point Bruges.  Everyone loved their food.  I had the tarte flambee with Parma ham, arugula, cheese, rosemary, and eggs served over a light, crisp flatbread.  The ham and Gruyere croquet and steak and eggs also received raving reviews from the table.  I had a bite of the kids' liege waffles with ginger blueberries on top and they were delicious.  All of the portions are BIG.  We didn't get the prix fixe (one dish, one side, and one alcoholic drink) and were still stuffed at the end.    Of course, we got an order of mussels to share which were delicious as always.   Service was excellent.  Our servers were bright and friendly and our coffee was frequently refilled.  Overall, the opening of Park Bruges is a wonderful thing to happen to Highland Park.  It gives you the chance to experience all of the excellent food and beer of Point Bruges without being uncomfortably crammed like sardines into a tiny space during the extraordinarily long wait for your table.  I would give Park Bruges 5 stars if it were not for the unsightly and quite frankly ghettotastic vacant lot next door.  Park Bruges sits right next to an overgrown vacant lot that 2 buildings used to occupy (including the old Terry Villa who used to make the best Cheesesteaks in Pittsburgh).  The grass and weeds are so overgrown they're almost above your head.  I know that's not their property, but they should figure out who owns it and offer to cut the grass!",

We had PEI Mussels (appetizer), Onion Soup, Split a house salad (wonderful dressing), and a Tarte (think wood oven pizza) with creamed leeks, 'shrooms and bacon - heavenly.  The wine pours were heavy (thanks so much!), and the selection definitely above average.  P.S.  loved the music selection and hipster ladies with tats on the service.

The boyfriend got the gingerbread beer cocktail and really enjoyed it.  We might go back for the Belgian beer selection, but the service was ho-hum (sure they were busy, but I had to ask multiple times for my water to be refilled, server never came to check on the food, etc) and while the food was good, I'm not sure it's worth the price.  We got the tarte flambe-think pizza on a poppadom.  It was flavorful and crispy, and the arugula really complemented the ham nicely.  We got it with a side of potato gratin which was pretty meh.  We also had the brunch-style poutine, and here we were less impressed.  We've both eaten a lot of poutine (I'm from the Canadian border), and there's a certain way it should be--crispy thick cut fries with a rich, flavorful gravy.  The fries were rather soggy (and not just where the gravy hit them) and the gravy was pretty bland. The addition of sausage, while innovative, did not blend well with the gravy, causing the dish to be unnecessarily heavy and sweet.  Maybe we didn't pick the right menu items to fully experience Park Brugges.  I might give it another shot for lunch/dinner, but I won't be back for brunch.",

Okay, rough week, let's indulge.  Burger comes.  Looks okay.  No lettuce, no tomato, just burger, mayo, cheese, a bit of short rib chillin' under gouda.  Decide I'll ask for the LT, but no servers to be seen, I grab the bun.  It's crispy/flaky on the outside.  I am intrigued.  I go in for the bite.  and...BOOM.  Best burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  Lettuce & tomato is for chumps.  Seriously, this thing is fantastic; some people describe things as a \"party in my mouth.\"  Well, if it's normally just a party, this is a Tiesto-DeadMau5 rave.    Get the Brugge burger.  (Yes, I only gave it 4 stars...it looks modern/chic inside, which is not at all like Belgium, and I think a place that has a good beer list should have a great bar, but it looks like more of an afterthought.)",

    "text": "After church, my 7-year-old daughter wanted to have lunch \"in the city.\"  I had hoped to visit Point Brugge.  They were running a 45 minute wait.    So, I called over to Park Bruges in Highland Park and no wait at all.  I asked the hostess if the place OK for kids and she immediately replied: \"But of course!\"  I appreciate that kind of warm welcome for kid diners.  By the time we arrived, we ended up having to wait a few minutes as the place was slammed all of a sudden and a few tables were in the process of tabbing out.  No problem, it gave me and my daughter time to look over the menu where nearly every item sounded like something I wanted to try.  Deciding on what to order was no easy task.  In the end, my daughter went with the mac and cheese (but of course, she's 7!).  I would order this myself next time!  I had a few bites and it was really good.  I ordered the special - beef short rib hash.  Heavenly.  The beef was melt in your mouth good, crispy potatoes and veggies.  Plus, it came with a brunch beverage - the spicy bloody mary went great with what I ordered.  (You can choose between a mimosa, beer cocktail, glass of prosecco or a bloody mary.)    Maybe I'm just getting older and cranky but I'm finding that Sunday brunch is a lost art these days.  Sunday brunch does not equal silver tins of sausage and bacon and a waffle station.  I can get both at the Residence Inn and it's free with my room.  But we were both very pleased with Sunday brunch at Park Bruges in every way: ambience (sleek without being stuffy), service (incredibly friendly and welcoming to me and my kid, very attentive), food (delicious!) and value (I love when my entree comes with a choice of brunch beverage).  Can't wait to go back on Sunday!",

Don't get me wrong, it's clean, chic and super trendy, standing out in the quiet neighborhood of Highland Park. However, I'd expect something a bit more in theme with \"Belgium.\"   Besides that, everything works. The beer selection is modest but incredibly diverse (we tried: 3 Philosophers, Hoegaarden White, and Grimbergen Blond). The PEI Mussels in classic white wine sauce are not to be missed. Mussels the size of your fat aunt's large toe (a.k.a. very big), and so succulent you can't help but lick the plate after you're done.

It's also along the Pittsburgh marathon route, so that could be something sometime... Maybe eat brunch inside while they run by? Dunno if that's allowed.  Anyway, chicken and waffles. In my not so humble opinion, chicken and waffles is the quintessential brunch item because it combines both breakfast and lunch on the same plate. Same plate is key, imo. If I'm getting brunch, I need both meals on the plate, not, \"available to order\" separately. So yes, they have chickie and waffles, and it's good. Supposedly the honey is spicy with cayenne, but I didn't get any spice. I do eat lots of spice though, so I have a tolerance. Large portion, plus a couple eggs, which is unusual but highly welcomed.  In addition, we had a flatbread covered, entirely, with chorizo, cheese, black beans, eggs, onions, pico de gallo, and so on. Very, very good. I'm not a salmon person, but the lox and eggs sandwich was, I'm told, \"quite delicious,\" so hey, that's good.  Decor inside is pretty simple, but that doesn't bother me. It might bother you, but get past it because the food is good, and that's why you're there.  Now look at my photos and enjoy the view of the succulent, perfectly cooked chicken, or the ridiculously loaded flatbread. Adore the beautiful sandwich and fruit. Feel your mouth water. You're feeling hungry. Give in to your temptation. Go try it!",

A little disappointed with the service, our waiter was really awkward and didn't seem to know how to approach us. Overall an okay experience.",

Breakfast sandwich had no capers, and fried chicken was over fried. Probably won't come back here again, which is sad because we live in the neighborhood.",

I was also happy that they serve brunch on Saturday and Sunday as Point Brugge only does Sunday. I ordered the eggs benedict with rosemary ham and chives hollandaise and my friend had the apple walnut salad. The eggs benedict was delicious! Their hollandaise is perfect as it is not too creamy but not too thin. The only thing I could have was some more hollandaise. The ham had a nice rosemary flavor. My friend enjoyed her salad as well. We shared the zepolli donuts for dessert. The donut holes were a bit lackluster and we both agreed you definitely need to dunk it in the sauces to add some sweetness. Overall, a great place to grab brunch as there are a wide variety of options and the prices are very reasonable!",

The food was great and our waiter was attentive. Definitely come early as it gets crowded.   We ordered the waffles with seasonal fruit (strawberry and mango) and the classic white wine mussels. The waffles weren't that big in size but it was a good portion. The fruits were delicious and fresh! Hands down, this place has one of the best mussels dishes. It was delicious that you could even just drink the broth! Order the mussels! You won't regret it! (Unless you don't like mussels). The food is good but it's definitely a bit pricey for the quantity.",

The menu has lots of entrees and a la carte items including waffles and omelets and salads and mussels..... but I think the best way to go is to choose from the prix fixe option: there are many, many choices... and each comes with an entree, a side, and a beverage.  I had a mimosa (yum!) with a frittata of the day (white beans, roasted tomatoes, broccolini, and fresh pesto) with a side potato gratin. The frittata was almost to large to finish, and the flavors of the fresh ingredients melded perfectly. The potatoes were a yummy stack of creamy deliciousness. It was a great way to begin the day!",

The garlic dijon mayonnaise was such a good combination with the fries and ketchup was available upon request if the traditional combo is more your thing.  I ordered the side of Bruges Frites for $6 and was surprised by the large portion. It would be perfect to share with a group of friends in addition to entrees or in my case with my boyfriend as a snack.  The restaurant was on the smaller side, but we had no problem getting seated on a Saturday morning.  Street parking was not a problem either.  The menu entrees seemed a little pricey to me, but it would be worth going back to decide if the price is worth it!",

Unfortunately there are seating is a little lacking due to their space. This particular evening we went to point breeze first and it was an hour wait so we made our way over to the Highland Park location. They had just recently updated their menu and had many new options and it was hard to decide. We ended up going with an appetizer of fried cauliflower,the short ribs and the salmon.  The fried cauliflower appetizer was one of the best apps I have had in a very long time. My husband enjoyed the short ribs I had a bite and they were melt in your mouth tender. The salmon was perfect and served with roasted brussels sprouts and a sweet potato risotto. I didn't love the risotto, but I did not, NOT I like.  For dessert we enjoyed their mouth watering bread pudding which is the best I've ever had. If you haven't gone here already please make your way to one of the Bruges they now have three locations!",

Service was spotty but they were flooded with tables immediately upon opening so that's to be expected. Food wait times were also on the long side and you would imagine that they would be used to the mass influx of people immediately upon opening and would prep appropriately.  Food was delicious as always. Bloody Mary was a little on the bland side. The liege waffles are very good (not quite to the level of Bertrand but very good). And I love the inventive fruit topping. That days was bourbon peach. The side dish of herbed gratin potatoes was bland and slightly overdone on top. It needed more herbs for sure but as far as side dishes go not horrible. The flambee tarts was ginormous and delicious. The crust was thin and crispy, the addition of the acid from the tomatoes was perfect, it was loaded with smoked Gouda and bacon, and when dipped in the accompanying eggs it was truly my favorite option our table partook in.  It's a lovey location and very close to the zoo if you intend to spend the day there, a great option for a meal as opposed to overpriced chicken tenders and fries (sadly though no giraffes to watch while you eat so the zoo still has everyone in Pittsburgh beat when it comes to the view while dining).",

    "text": "Really a 4.5, but I'm rounding down.  My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. I was initially surprised by the decor. I'm visiting PGH for the first time, and Park Bruges doesn't look like any other place I've been to so far in PGH. It's modern-ish and I loved it. The staff seemed really relaxed. We were seated immediately, as we were arriving for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. There were about 5 or 7 other tables with customers.  We were given water immediately, and our waitress seemed nice enough. He ordered the Bruges burger, I the grilled veggie melt (I can't remember the name and it's not on the menu on the website), and we shared an order of Bruges frites.  The fries were perfectly salted, but soggy. One of the reasons why it's not 5 stars. They weren't greasy soggy, just soggy. I also like my french fries piping hot, and these weren't burn-your-mouth-hot, so not ideal for me. The roasted garlic dijon mustard that comes with the fries in delish though! I plan on recreating it at home.  My boyfriend says the burger is the best burger he's ever had. The bun to meat ratio is fantastic, and the bun is perfectly toasted. The patty was juicy (as witnessed by me, because it was dripping juices onto his plate) but the bun didn't get soggy at all. As a vegetarian, even I thought the burger looked amazing.  My veggie sandwich was amazing. As silly as it sounds, a good/well made grilled veggie sandwich is hard to come by. Often times the bread will not stand up well to cooked vegetables, and water from the vegetables will drip all over the place. The sandwich has arugula (my fave), grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, tomatoes, feta, hummus, and maybe some other things I can't remember. It was all on a perfectly toasted ciabatta bread. It was crispy enough to hold up to the vegetables, but not so hard that it cuts the roof of your mouth when you bite into it.  My biggest complaint about lunch was the slaw that came with the burger and sandwich. I still haven't figured out what was off about it, but it was not tasty. I seemed oily, and kind of flavorless. With that being said, the sandwich and burger more than made up for a sub optimal coleslaw.",

    "text": "This might be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been here multiples times for brunch and dinner, and a few times just for drinks. All of these experiences have been great.  I can never resist the mussels with white wine sauce - I always ask for extra bread to soak up the extra sauce so I don't \"waste\" a single taste! Also AMAZING is the flat iron steak salad. I ask for the steak medium-rare and it is always cooked to perfection. The warm potatoes and champagne vinaigrette create a great combination with the blue cheese and caramelized onions (if that sounds strange to you, you'll have to trust me and try it!). I try the mac & cheese everywhere I go, and I have to say this is not my favorite mac & cheese in town (it is a little thick for my liking), but it is good. And don't forget to save room for dessert!  Prices are reasonable and the fact that it is BYOB (not advertised, but you can bring your own bottle for a $5-10 corking fee), makes it the perfect place to have a nice 3-course dinner for 2 without spending over $100.  Brunch has some similar options to its sister restaurant, but it also has some new/different items. Among my favorites are the eggs benedict, veggie frittata, and salmon scrambler.  Last, if you love Belgian beer (like I do), you will appreciate their selection and the bartender's knowledge. They can make good recommendations based on your preferences, so it is a good place to try out some new brews.",

    "text": "My friend, A, and I went to brunch here.  I have been to Point Bruges several times and know that if you want to go to brunch and don't want to wait in line you get there early.  We arrived at 10:30 for an 11 am open.  We were not the only ones.  Standing about 4th in line, we were sat within minutes of opening and had waters and some of the best coffee I have ever had within a few minutes more.    A and I like to think that we are brunch professionals having sampled quite a few in the city, so we knew that we should try something varied in order to share.  She ordered the omelette of the day which was prosciutto, asparagus and goat cheese with fresh fruit.  The salty meat and savory vegetables melded perfectly with the creamy goat cheese.  The eggs were cooked to perfection with just enough crisp on the edges.  Slices of cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon surrounded a pile of strawberries and grapes.  All of the fruit was perfectly ripe.    I ordered the brunch-style Poutine.  When eating out, go big or go home.  The massive pile of double-fried fries was covered with 2 fried eggs - again perfectly cooked.  These people know their eggs.  Scattered throughout the pile were local cheese curds.  Having a lot of friends from Wisconsin, I like to think that I know my cheese curds.  They need to squeak if they are good - and these squeaked away.  A surprising treat was the homemade maple-apple sausage.  Real apples, definitely real maple syrup and delicious pork made up the sausage.  The fries were definitely more than I could handle, but A was happy to help.  For me, brunch would not be complete with a Bloody Mary and this was a serious Bloody Mary - no pre-made, store-bought mix here.  Absolute love.    All in all, this has to be one of the best brunches in the city.  I look forward to coming back for dinner!",

Mussels, Mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, Mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels mussels...  I mean, seriously, the mussels...just thinking about them makes my mouth water. Now, obviously, I'm a BIG fan of mussels, and I've eaten a lot of good mussels in a lot of good places, but nothing compares. They are known for their mussels, and everyone says to go for their mussels...yea, yea - but no, really, go for their mussels.  I had visited their sister company quite some time ago, Point Bruges - and ever since have been itching to visit this place. The mussels and everything we had at Point was amazing.   While mostly positive things come to mind when thinking of this restaurant...my mussels and frites were - beyond delicious. However,my friends pasta meal came out...luke warm...so there's that. We were having a very late lunch (senior citizen style dinner), so there weren't many in the restaurant. We were at a two top - and the service was great - attentive and seemed genuinely interested - but after our plates were cleared, I was still finishing a glass of wine, and we began to feel rushed. The waitress coming over multiple times (glass of wine still half full) looking for the payment for the check that she gave us. I looked behind us and saw that the dinner rush was beginning, there were quite a few people waiting for a table at this point. The table next to us - another two top - was empty - so I knew we were getting the feeling of being rushed because they were going to combine our two with that two to make a four top - low and behold - as soon as we stood, that happened. Well, such is life - for a restaurant who doesn't take reservations - they must turn tables quickly. There was another incident with a toddlers squeaky shoes (I mean these shoes were purposefully squeaky as though they had a dog toy in them) who walked around the restaurant for a bit too long - but I can imagine management was probably stuck between a rock and hard place with that one.  All in all though, very satisfied. Great place to go...not sure why, but feels very Pittsburgh to me. Very really good eats Pittsburgh.  And you must try the mussels ;-)",

Waitress was friendly and food came out fast. But nothing was extraordinary: the food as a whole was bland; the mussel meat was quite small and didn't really have any taste; the tuna was probably cooked too much that it was quite floppy. We were full in the end, but it wasn't worth the $40+ per person we paid for, even if it included a very expensively priced beer.",

Otherwise, this place fills up fast and you may be stuck with a long wait.    My boyfriend and I chose to dine here on Valentine's weekend, and had not trouble getting a table for 2 around 8:30pm.  Great European beer selection, with nice wine and cocktail lists as well.  The service was fabulous.  I really wish I could remember our server's name...she was totally sweet and went out of her way to answer our questions about the menu.  I'm not typically a fan of mussels, but these are not to be missed.  We went with the green curry preparation as per the recommendation of our server.  After we finished off the mussels, we used the loaves of crusty bread to mop up the rest of the curry.  If curry isn't your thing, they offer two other sauces: classic white wine and spicy creole.  For our meals, I went with the Grouper Special, while my boyfriend chose the Faroe Island Salmon.  We both really enjoyed our meals, although next time I would probably order the salmon myself!  The portions were generous, especially for the price.  This is a solid spot for a casual, laid-back dining experience.  Great food options, friendly service, and usually pretty easy to find parking on Bryant Street.  Can't wait to come back soon for brunch!",

The bread was wonderful (and stayed crisp the whole time!), the cheese was gooey and melty, and the oven-roasted tomatoes added a wonderful smokiness to the sandwich.  Imagine the flavor of hearty marinara sauce without the actually messy sauce, and that's what these tomatoes were like.  And I got it with bacon, of course!  Coleslaw on the side to lighten things up, and I was a happy camper.  I ate the whole thing, and since I generally have only a moderate appetite, I think that shows wise portion sizes on the part of Park Bruges.  The sandwich was $9 with bacon, I believe $8 without.  I also got the \"side salad\" which was $7, and seemed expensive, but it was also enormous.  2 people could easily share this and each person's portion would still be larger than your usual \"side salad.\"  I loved the sweet walnuts, and tangy cheese on top to keep the salad exciting.  Service was a little slow, but our server was very friendly and brought us some bread and butter since we were so hungry.  They were busy, but not packed, at 1:15 on a Saturday.  Lunch is a great way to get a taste of this place for a smaller price - and they offer their macaroni and cheese at lunch too!  I wanted so badly to order it, but I was determined to try something new and I'm so glad I did.  I could eat one of those grilled cheese sandwiches every day.",

Dress code would be \"come as you are and just enjoy.\"  We arrived around 6pm and, although the restaurant was quickly filling up, we were able to be seated right away, as we were just a party of two.  The traditional Moules Frites was heavenly and, thankfully, I was offered additional fresh baguette so that I could enjoy that wonderful sauce. I understood quickly why I was given a spoon.  My husband had the Steak Frites and he enjoyed every morsel.  We ended the meal with a delicious piece of Tarte Tatin with a wonderful crust and truly fabulous caramel sauce.  Our server was lovely and helpful and helped us choose the right Belgian beer to go with our meals.    The only thing I want to note is that the last time we were here was almost a year ago and I pointed out that there was no baby changing table in the restroom.  We did not have our now-toddler with us this time around, but I noticed that there was still no changing table in the restroom. Certainly, it's not the most sightly item to decorate the wall of a bathroom, but I'm sure it would be a welcome convenience for the many families who frequent this place.",

It's hard to live up to the hype, especially that PGH yelpers tend to label everything the \"Best in Pittsburgh.\"  In my experience, that label has been placed on very questionable places.  This place, however, is a homerun.  For a Sunday brunch, I couldn't be happier.  The much-touted mussels were as great as advertised.  The mussels are in a brilliant and delicious broth, which you just want to drink straight up.  And the bread is a perfect fluff with a crunchy crust to soak up the juices.  The serving sizes are large -- and for around $10-14 per entree, it's head-scratching how they can make a profit.  You get a LOT of smoked salmon with your eggs benedict, you get a LOT of lamb with your Moroccan eggs, and you get a pizza sized Torte Flambe.  In addition, the service was excellent.  The food was out quickly, the waitstaff walked the tables offering coffee refills (a welcome change from having to track them down!), and they were friendly and helpful with the menu items.  Based on all the previous reviews, there are several items I'm eager to try next time.  I don't think you can ask for anything more.",

Our server was rarely available. We waited a long time for drinks; so long that we saw the bartender make herself a drink and take a few swigs while we were waiting for ours. The mimosas were good according to my friends, but the bloody mary I had was terrible. It was excessively salty and peppery.  The food itself is great. I had a brunch poutine that was amazing. The cheese curds, egg, sausage gravy, and fries all worked very well together. Everyone else enjoyed their food too, except for the potatoes gratin, which were undercooked.  In summary, the food was great, but the service and drinks make me question how quickly I'll go back.",

Myself and my roommate have gotten the park burger, macaroni and cheese, the mussels and frites, Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak Salad, and Gemelli Pasta. I can't decide which plate was my favorite so far since they were all completely delicious! I also got the Brooklyn Summer Ale and it was one of the best beers I've had in Pittsburgh so far. I can't recommend this place enough. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that our waitress was a little slow with the service. However, the food made up for it. Also, we got take out twice and it was ready in 10 minutes only.",

It's really nice to be able to comfortably sit in a spacious restaurant that doesn't get so loud as to impede conversation.  Other than that, the food at this restaurant was excellent just as at Point Bruges.  I've had multiple preparations of the fresh mussels and they are all excellent.  I've also sampled the various other dishes that my girlfriend has ordered, and those were excellent as well.  I also appreciate the friendliness and promptness of the staff.

There were a few vegetarian options already on the menu, which my friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was delicious. They were more than happy to omit meat from their regular menu items as well so I ordered the Tartes Flambee with the fig,arugula and goat cheese without the prosciutto. We also shared an order of their delicious frites.  Overall, nice place-if a bit small- I will go back for sure!",

Although it was a back-up brunch plan to e-squared located on the same street, my friend and I were very pleased with this decision.   I enjoyed the prixe fix menu by choosing the the steak and eggs, potatoes and started it all with a delicious Bloody Mary! It was so good that I ordered a second.   My friend ordered a the crab cake/ Eggs Benedict paired with fresh fruit. When we arrived, there was a line around the building but the service kept up with the demand. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender had the Bloody's in front of us within minutes.   We will be going back because  my friend's favorite beer is currently on tap, Le fin Du Monde. Seasonal I am sure, this restaurant is stays fresh with it's evolving menu based on local crops and other seasonal factors. You can tell the staff at Park Bruege loves what they do!!",

For the majority of the group, it was their first time at the restaurant - this was my second.   The menu is similar to their sister restaurant, Pointe Bruges, but the ambiance of the restaurant is quite different, in that Park Bruges doesn't seem as inviting as is its counterpart.  I enjoyed their 1/2 portion of mussels in a spicy curry sauce. Served with French bread on the side, it is absolutely perfect. The flavors are bold, yet not overpowering. I couldn't resist but finish off all of the broth in the bowl - it's just that tasty.   The bar has a large selection of beer on tap and in bottle. I paired a lovely Belgian beer with my mussels. I could have had another, but had to go back to work :(",

My friends and I came here one time and we truly tested out their drinking menu. Similar to Pointe Brugge, it has a bunch of beer selections. However, my personal favorite is their Moscow mule served in a copper/tin looking glass/mug! It's fun to drink and the taste is very nice and smooth. Not too sweet and easy to sip on. But if you are into beers, they have many other selections. They even have tasty virgin drinks for any pregnant ladies out there!  Onto the food. MUSSELS!! Of course we come here mostly for their mussels. To be completely honest we prefer Pointe Brugge mussels slightly more, but this place is still very good! The only thing is they serve it in one size (1lb I believe)...Pointe Brugge gives a slight more option in terms serving size.   We have also tried their other food as well and it was also very delicious. What they call as their \"small plates\" are by no means small at all! We made the mistake of telling our friends they wouldn't get enough food with two small plates...that resulted in them going home with a bagful of leftovers lol. Their \"flat bread pizza\" or whatever it's called in French is really good, and so was their pork belly! If you like fatty food, must try the pork belly. We ordered a few other entree but I don't remember them all - regardless everyone loved their own food! From appetizers to sandwiches to special entree, everything was good.  I couldn't give this place a five star because 1) mussels are better at their sister restaurant and 2) they don't offer the same Belgian chocolate dessert as their sister restaurant.  But yeah, if you are in the area, go explore!",

The food is always piping hot and delicious. The prices are reasonable for what you get. And the atmosphere is clean and comfortable.   If you are a booth lover like me, this place is for you! It's at least 70% booths/banquets. Yes! I also enjoy sitting at the bar. (My only complaint is they don't have purse hooks at the bar ... such a necessity! Hopefully they add those soon.)   As far as drinks go, their Moscow Mules do not disappoint and I always find a tasty beer or wine to try.   As you will see in other reviews here, Mussels w/ classic sauce and frites are where it's at. They also serve my husband's favorite burger in town. It's all about the bun!   Do yourself a favor and check this place out ... just know that there is almost always a wait so if you want to get in right away I recommend a geriatric 5:00 p.m. dining hour. Or lunch. It's also a great spot for lunch. :)   Cheers!",

It did get a bit loud, but it's a smallish room.  We got a couple of beers (great selection) and the Classic Montreal Poutine to start- came out right away. I got the Shortrib Pasta- huge portion, great taste (maybe needed a bit of salt) and reasonably priced. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  We finished with the Salted Caramel Brownie Cheesecake. It was pretty small- as the server warned us- but it was very rich and definitely worth it.

The menu is kind of small in my opinion, but it seems that most people go there for the mussels.  We started with Soup of the Day (which at this moment I can not remember, but was it was good!) and House Salad.  Both were slightly above average.  The main thing I liked about the House Salad was the dressing!  Then we got the mussels in the Lobster sauce and braised short ribs.  Mussels were yummy and definitely be my choice if we came back.  The braised short ribs were a little disappointing.  It was cooked pretty well, tender and moist, but I didn't think the flavor was that good.

Overall, I think I prefer Point Brugge, but I can't exactly pinpoint the reason. Maybe my experiences have been just a bit better there. It could also be because the restaurant is a block from my house.   Anyway, Park Bruges offers a mix of sandwiches, salads, and larger entrees. Two other items they are known for are poutine and mussels. I have had mussels at Point Brugge and they were great, so I would imagine the same would be True here.   On my most recent trip (last night) I had the flat iron steak salad, which was delicious. In addition to the juicy, medium-rare steak, the salad came complete with bleu cheese, tomatoes, herbed potatoes, and a champagne vinaigrette. Totally awesome.   In the past I have also had some of their pasta dishes which have all been excellent as well. Dessert items vary, but last night we had a flourless cake with raspberry mousse filling and, while one slice is large enough to share, I could have eaten literally the entire cake. It was that good.   Service has always been great, too. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area.",

Before I entered the restaurant there were people eating lunch on the tables outside-which had a very inviting and relaxing cafe feel to the place. As soon as we entered there was someone ready to seat us and we were fortunate enough to grab a window seat (the weather was absolutely beautiful)  We ordered a small portion of the white moules for an appetizer. The mussels are served in a warm white wine sauce and comes with a side of fresh bread. We devoured the mussels then managed to dip the bread in the left over sauce. For individual dishes we ordered the chorizo tarte flambee, steak frites, and brisket sandwich. The tarte flambee was a little too large for me to finish ( and I am a big eater- so it was perfect for me to take home) What I loved most about it was the crunch of the flatbread.  Sometimes the bread gets too soggy with fresh ingredients but this had a good balance between the toppings and the baked bread.  All the portions were generous and not too salty. I am a french fry killer and i thought the ones served with the steak were perfectly crispy- loved it. I also ordered a mojito for lunch and it was delicious. It was a little on the sweeter side but still very fresh and refreshing.   The service at this place was made the whole experience so much better. They were always making sure we had enough water, drinks, napkins at our table and were ready to clear plates at the right time. I've been to Point Brugge a few times but it was my first time here. Park has more seating and more variety on their menu.",

The sad little grapes only had 2 that were edible. The poutine was too salty and the cheese curds were a little scarce.

The biggest offense for me were the mussels which had a strong smell of urine. I googled this, and some say this is the smell mussels can get, because they lay around in their own pee. Whether or not this is True, I am going to pass on mussels from here on out. The broth however was very nice, and hid the overall string stank..Plus I didn't die, so maybe everything was OK after all. I expected a big more from the place, and I not sure if I would return",

The third member of our group thoroughly enjoyed the Pulled Pork Chile Rojo. I had a salad and frites, FYI the \"side\" order of frites is freakin' huge. Like, dinner plate portion huge. We would definitely go back for brunch and to check out their dinner menu as well. This location seems to be less crowded then the Hastings St. venue and since they don't take reservations I would most likely choice the Park over the Pointe for that reason since both seem to be equally enjoyable.",

    "text": "I've heard people talk about this place all the time and finally decided to go and see for myself.   It was prime brunch time and it was so crowded here that we had to get seated at the bar or else wait hours to get seated.   We ordered the baked french toast which looked extremely appetizing.  When I had a bite it seemed to lack something...There wasn't a lot of flavor in the strawberries that were in the french toast which was pretty disappointing.  I ordered the bruges frites brunch style.  It was a heaping pile of fries, eggs, sausage gravy, and cheese.  The first few bites were amazing but afterwards i found the fries too salty, being covered in gravy made them soggy as well.  Some chunks of cheese were not melted and dispersed well enough either.  I liked the fries that were untouched by the gravy - one of the best fries I've ever eaten.",

Everything that we ordered tasted fresh and was interesting, a little bit different from your standard eggs and bacon (but you can get that if you want :) ).   I ordered the tarte flambee. It was what i would call a breakfast pizza with a Mexican flare (chorizo and pico de gallo were involved). It was DELICIOUS! So fresh and flavorful! The portion was huge though, a could have definitely split it with someone. But don't worry,  I also ordered the special waffle of the day (fat kid alert!), because hey, I can't just order something super Mexican at a Belgium place right? The waffle of the day was pineapple strawberry. The waffle was great, especially the fresh fruit topping. there is nothing like real fruit on waffles!   The only let down was they didn't have espresso. But hey, you can order beer with brunch so it makes up for it.   A must do in Highland Park!",

    "text": "Note: During the week, their kitchen closes at 10pm.  This sister restaurant to Point Brugges in Point Breeze (Park Bruges is in Highland Park. Get the pattern?) mostly impressed me the other night but didn't turn the tone of Pittsburgh's culinary scene topsy-turvy either in my opinion. Nor did it throw my personal dining expectations into a simmering pot of turmoil. Allow me to elucidate...  Poutine: I had been coveting it ever since I learned of it through an online forum centered in Canada years ago (don't ask). When I first read of it, I dismissed it as \"disco fries\" or \"fries with gravy and cheese.\" That was until the Canadian users positively jumped all over me for my ignorance, chastising me for making light of what is signature comfort food of The Great White North. \"It's not just cheese, you n00b. It's cheese curds,\" I was snarkily told like a Trekkie who had haplessly wandered onto a Star Wars message board.   The gist of it all was that I simply didn't know what I was missing and would never get to have some \"real\" poutine unless I journeyed north of the border.   So, once I read that \"real\" poutine was being served in a Pittsburgh dining establishment, I just had to go and try that which was forbidden to Yanks such as myself.   Choosing my appetizer was easy to decide. Enthusiastically, I told our excellent server Kristen what I wanted and eagerly awaited it.   What came to our table was a plate full of properly fried (twice) gravy-smothered tater sticks, a cluster of white cubes, and a cup of roasted garlic mayonnaise (my request).   I suppose I got the impression that everything would coagulate together into a heap of divinely fattening chaos, but it didn't quite do that.   Again, the fries were immaculate, the aioli making them mythically munchable, but that gravy was dull, man. I barely detected it. In fact, it got in the way, as did the cheese cubes, which again, hardly registered a blip on the gustatory radar screen. I almost thought the curds were tofu, and the heat from the fries hardly broke them down. That I was able to eat these with my fingers and didn't need a fork was telling. Not that the poutine was abominable at all, and to repeat, this was the first time I've ever had it, but I keep getting the vague feeling that it should have and could have been even better than it was.  I came very close to ordering a burger, but I opted instead at the 11th hour for the more sophisticated (and expensive) Roasted Jamison Lamb.   Hmmm. The lamb was carved into squares that were pink in the center and easily chewable. Roasted apples, pureed parsnip, and a pesto of almonds and caramelized onions added woodsy depth to the plate. The apples and mock mashed potatoes in the parsnip gave me a sense of comfort and familiarity. The pesto was exotic, sylvan, nutty, and saccharine and complimented the puree as well as the protein superbly. The modest serving gave me a reason to savor each morsel, to divide each slice of meat and drag it through the puree and pesto before eating it, to not scarf it down like a famished brute. This was most certainly gourmet and not for gluttons, which kind of describes me...at times.  Kay's 1.5 pound of mussels delighted her almost as much as mussels elsewhere have. After tasting some for myself, I too felt a slight whiff of disappointment in a lobster-pernod, fresh tarragon & basil sauce (one of 3 kinds offered by the restaurant) that was good enough but not amazingly ambrosial and mussels that were surely tasty but lacked the plumpness I have grown accustomed to. Don't misunderstand me. These mussels were fine, but I have doubtlessly had mussels that were bigger, better. *sneeze* Meat & Potatoes *sneeze*  Kay and I were supposed to trade off on a duo of desserts in the Tarte Tatin and a Chocolate Souffle, but Kay pretty much hoarded her souffle since she relished it so much. The Tarte Tatin was described to me by Kristen as an \"upside down apple pie\" but reminded me of a strudel when it came time to eat it. Honeyed and fruity, the soft apples yielded to my fork and teeth perfectly, the crust delivering oodles of texture, the fresh whipped cream knoll cutting the sweetness down a notch. Kay's dessert was essentially a light, cakey mousse that was merely enhanced, not overrun by chocolate. Embraced by a salted caramel, the souffle was not nearly as decadent as one would think, which by no means is a strike against it. To me, however, the Tarte Tatin won the duel, scarcely upsetting the souffle.   Is PBC worthy of the hype? Eh, for the most part, yes. I'd still like to try that burger, though. My decision nags at me.   P.S. The atmosphere was more casual and inviting than I thought it would be. As we waited to be seated (about 15 minutes) we spoke with a party who came all the way from Pleasant Hills to try Park Bruges. South Hills folk will come to the East End for good eats after all. I'm glad I'm not the only one.",

    "text": "We walked in for Sunday brunch and were seated in less time than it takes to drink a glass of water (served by the friendly bartender).  The enthusiastic waiter got our drinks quickly, and we were off to an excellent start.  I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a restaurant by its Bloody Marys, and the one ordered by my sister was delicious (it had fresh dill in it -- inspired!).  But what got my attention immediately was that the unsweetened iced tea was just as delicious.  It's just water and tea leaves!  Why doesn't mine taste flowery and very gently tannic?  I forgot to ask what kind of tea they use, but it tastes fantastic.  This was a good harbinger, and the rest of the meal was just as satisfying.  We got pommes frites for the table, a decision I recommend.  Three of us had vegetable frittatas, which were tasty if maybe just a little more virtuous than necessary, and one had crabcakes with braised kale.  The kale was the best thing on the table -- smoky but bright with tomato sweetness and acidity.  Yum.  We felt we had some indulgence coming to us after our fritattas, so we got the doughnut holes with cherry and chocolate sauces.  Life was then complete.  If I lived in this lovely neighborhood, I would come here all the time.",

I'm just surprised that most of the storefronts on this road were shuttered or closed down.  It's a shame with Park Bruge being so popular... You'd think more people would come out here seeking other businesses.  But I digress...  A late afternoon lunch offered a chance to slip right in.  Still being on a diet, I resisted the urge to order the poutine (soon, my friends, there will be some cheat days!).  I saw the Spinach Salad and thought, perfect!  The salad comes with strawberries, pears, dried cranberries, candied walnuts and multigrain crostini.  I also added in portobello mushrooms for an extra $2.  Good choice on my part!  The bello's were nice, big and juicy and a perfect addition to a flavorful salad.  I really enjoyed the creamy chevre walnut dressing too, especially because they don't scrimp on it (if you like light dressing you might want to get it on the side).  I also really loved the candied walnuts (dah!).  There was a ton of spinach, so you really don't have to worry about it being a dinky salad!  The crostini, meh, I took a couple nibbles but left most aside.    The service was extremely friendly but laid back.  To the point where if you had somewhere to be, you may want to keep an eye on time, it can get a little slow.    I definitely want to come back off diet so I can indulge in some of the delicious looking items ie POUTINE!",
