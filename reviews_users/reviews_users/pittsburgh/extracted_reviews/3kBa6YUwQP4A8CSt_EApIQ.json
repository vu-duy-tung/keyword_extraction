    "text": "This Walnut Grill location was absolutely terrible. The service and our appetizer started out great, however after that everything went down hill. Our waiter, although nice, came to our table about every 2 minutes and 30 seconds . He kindly explained to us that the kitchen had messed up and was remaking half of our parties meal and would be out very shortly. When I specifically got my food (buffalo chicken Flatbread which is what I normally get) all of the toppings, including the cheese, fell right off of the Flatbread. I should have taken pictures because as I came to find out, while the bread was cooked the cheese was not and there was about 7 pounds of Buffalo sauce on the meal. I do understand he had brought my food out literally seconds after it was done but if he would have explained to me that it was just pulled out and it would be a little longer, I would have been fine with that.   To that note we waited a good 30 minutes for our actual meals to come out after the appetizer, which to me is unacceptable. It was also not even close to busy.   Overall, this location was a pretty big flop. The Wexford location is much better in terms of overall service. More then likely will never go back to this location.",

We had to go get our own menus, the food took about an hour to come out once we had the opportunity to even order (our waitress would disappear for half hours at a time before we even ordered and that was even before we got drink orders in which also took forever to get to us even though we saw them sitting at the bar.) The food didn't come out as it was described on the menu at all: I ordered the Ruben eggs Benedict which sounded interesting and delicious. It came out as a poor excuse for a meal, missing cheese and having an anemic amount of substance. It was mostly large pieces of bread and one single slice of corned beef on each piece that they probably bought for 12 at giant eagle next door. The \"dinner size\" of the orange chicken was laughable and by laughable I mean sad. It was $17 for two tiny pieces of chicken tenders covered in sugar basically. I don't feel bad writing this review. We used to go to the one in mt Lebanon and it was pretty good. But this location was a poor excuse for a restaurant. And they certainly did NOT deserve the $47 we paid for the awful service and food. Sorry but this place sucks.",

I got a beat salad w/ shrimp, tasted like some quality ingredients were used to make it.   I just wish I had more, the salads average like 13-17 dollars with meat, for that price I would hope to have some more salad is all- if a rating was just based on service, cleanliness, and taste I would say the walnut grill would be a 4 star.

My fiance ordered your $26.00 crab cake dinner and it was  a laugh. The two crab cakes were mostly crab and I will give you that but they were 1/2 the size of my fist along with the mushy side vegetables.To top it off everything was cold. We also ordered fish tacos and they were ok and still pretty warm but the guacamole that came on the side was brown meaning it was either old or someone forgot lime juice I had sweet potato fries on the side and they were really cold much colder than the tacos. My mom ordered a salad with an add on of Ahi Tuna she had no c/o anything being wrong. I could keep going but I think this says enough.",

Like the chili. Tried the pick 2 with the crab cake. Tasty!",

There were many other options they could have put us. Drinks and food came out pretty quickly, nothing really to complain about here.   I got a shaved prime rib sandwich, mashed potatoes as a side and an order of tater tots. The tater tots were the best part by far. The mashed potatoes were pretty good and would order again. However, the sandwich was very disappointing. To start off with, I ordered it without mushrooms and peppers, and i swear they gave me extra peppers and mushrooms. Plus it was all cooked together so it was extremely difficult to simply pull them off. The beef was very bland and kinda lukewarm. The baguette it came on was pretty good. There was no au jus sauce to dip it in which was a little disappointing.   I would go back, simply because I have heard many good things and I would give it another shot, but overall, it was very \"meh\"",

The waitress immediately told us that they were a little behind and that they might be slow with our food order.  We waited a very long 1 hour and 20 minutes before we received our salads and an additional 20 minutes until we received our food!  An hour and 20 minutes?!! The restaurant looked fairly busy when we arrived but tables emptied quickly so I'm not understanding the reason for the poor service.  We asked the waitress if they were short of help and she said that they had plenty. The quality of the food was ok but certainly not worth an hour and 20 minute wait.  This was our 1st and last experience with the Walnut Grill at Settlers Ridge.  We will not return.",

Thai pork mac and cheese was good but could have been better on the cheesiness factor. We ordered the 1/2 sandwich and salad options - buffalo chicken wrap (pretty small serving size for a half but not bad in taste); reuben (the most disappointing item we got. The beef and flavors were good but the salt content was enough to kill a small human); candied walnut salad (pretty good); strawberry balsamic salad (also pretty good but balsamic dressing was goopy and sugary).   Probably wouldn't come back again since there are many other options in the area.",

This place could be so much more. Good menu, nice drink selection, etc. But it was EMPTY when we were there and the food was simply okay. Soup was a little too salty, cheese on my sandwich wasn't melted, table was sticky. Just a lot of misses.  My husband said it best. They need to decide if they are five stars or two. They are not the only option in the area. The decor says \"hip, kinda swanky, upscale bar but not too fancy\". The food and service say Applebees. Just confusing.",

However, when we asked to sit outside, the hostess said that there was nothing available. I understand if they were short-staffed, but there was no explanation after we asked why we could not be seated outside. We then proceeded to basically be ignored once we were seated inside, and we almost missed the movie we were going to after dinner.

The Robinson location has an awesome staff and is about 10 minutes from my house so I come here often.   This review for the Robinson location specifically. The bartenders are always awesome.  They have a great drink selection and multiple t.v.'s so it's always a go to spot to grab some drinks.  I have had a few issues in the past waiting forever to get my food.  Also, on 2 occasions, I was there when it was cold outside and it was freezing inside as well.  The menu has a little bit of everything and I'm never disappointed with the food....it's always a little above average and consistent.   My only real issue with this location is the one manager (bald gentleman) was very unfriendly to my wife and I one time and then very rude and condescending to my wife another time. The owner of walnut grill ended up being apologetic and very friendly though so I'm not going to give a bad rating over one guy.   Overall, solid neighborhood bar / restaurant...very friendly bartenders...good food...really good drinks...very nice owners.",

The filet was delicious and the french onion soup was among the best I have ever had. The service was super fast and waitress was really friendly. The price for two of us with drinks and tip was like $42 a bargain for such a delicious meal. If I am ever in that area again I would definitely go there again.",

Always handy as needed but not intrusive. Nice to go to a place w/ good, good food and have a delicious lunch without a server interrupting every 2 minutes ..need water, tea...  duh,  in so many places difficult to carry on any conversation b/c  servers are trying to help but instead are a constant  interruption to a private  or business conversation.

    "text": "I've heard such good things about this place. Too bad my experience didn't reflect that at all.   Immediately when we walked in, there was a nice atmosphere, and wasn't busy for a Tuesday happy hour. We sat in a booth by the bar and waited initially for our waitress for some time. She was short with us and immediately wrote us off after we just asked for waters to start (which, the water had a lemon in it but tasted almost... fishy? Nasty.)  Our waitress only had 4 tables including my friend and I's. She took solid gaps of time where she would disappear and not come back for 10+ minutes before we could order or ask for anything. By the time we got a sample for a wine, happy hour was over so we just stuck with no drink at all. Not worth the hassle.   When the food finally came out, it was mediocre. My Cobb salad tasted like it could be from a hospital cafeteria. The ranch was definitely mixed with water, was loose with no flavor at all. Best part of it was the crunchy bacon though. That was awesome. My friend's bowl had huge chunks of garlic but otherwise she seemed pleased.   Then it got weird. We watched our waitress literally run full speed to her car and take off. After being done with our meals and waiting for someone to acknowledge us (the only person around was the bartender at this point unfortunately, and another waitress who was only addressing a new table and avoiding us at all costs), we went to the hostess who told us our waitress left to get the rest of the employees Dairy Queen. I'm sorry, but are you kidding? I know employees need to eat too, I get that, but you left service with 3 open tables (but let's be real you ignored us or treated us like a pain in your ass for the most part anyway) to get Dairy Queen?? The hostess told us we could have the bartender help us close out. Sure thing.  Funny enough, as we got ready to leave, our waitress came back and cleared our table and flashed us both a nasty look and didn't say anything at all.   Shameful service. Here's to hoping it was an off day but based on some other reviews, I doubt it. I will never, ever come back.",

    "text": "It's a Wednesday night and we decided to try this place for dinner.  When walking inside, we noticed that it is clean with a current decor.  The hostess was friendly and offered us a seat in the bar area or dining area.  We chose the dining area as it was a bit quieter and we wanted to be able to talk.  The place was about 80% full, but we managed to get a booth.  After perusing the menu, we noticed the appetizers and entrees were fairly pricey and since we had never tried this place, we opted for a couple of sandwiches for our first visit.  My hubby settled on the Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich with fries and I chose the Beer Battered Cod Sandwich with fries.  After we ordered it took about 20 minutes for the food to come out.  At first glance, the plates looked pretty good (picture posted of the fish sandwich).  However, upon further inspection, the food was lacking in a big way.  The fish on the sandwich was cooked well on the inside but the batter was far from crispy.  In fact, it was down right soggy.  So much so that when trying to cut through it with a fork, it seemed like rubber.  The shaved prime rib sandwich had more bread than steak. Ultimately, better than the old SteakUm's used to be, but nothing to be excited about.  Hubby said it was \"meh\".  The fries sort of tasted like they had been reheated and there was absolutely no salt to be found on them.  Our whole meal had an overwhelming lack of flavor.  Thank goodness for ketchup and tartar sauce.    The service was good and our server was attentive and polite.  She refilled our drinks without being asked and brought the check in quick fashion when we were ready to leave.  The big bonus were the little bowl of mints on the way out.  We won't be back.",

They have good drink specials every day of the week (I personally favor Mojito Monday) and they always have a good selection of beer on tap. The service is generally pretty good, and the staff is friendly. They have some creative salads (I like the Strawberry Balsamico, add salmon), but they can be pricey if you get one that doesn't come with a protein and decide to add on. I haven't had anything bad here, but also nothing extraordinary. I would recommend if you aren't looking for a food experience, but just want a reliable place to hang out with friends.",

The creme brulee that should have been a silky custard was a vanilla flavored omelette. Fresh produce and cooking lessons are strongly advised for the chefs working here.",

Our waitress was incredibly slow and for the most part, seemed to disappear.  I've had Steve in the past and he is an excellent server.  I saw him at the next table and said hi wishing I could have had him again.   He is always so \"on it\" attentive and will make your dining experience what it should be. Back to our waitress, she didn't even explain what vegetables we would each be getting with our meal.  My husband and I swapped veggies.  Also, for reasons I will not even write in this review, my son was offered a second meal.  However, three out of five dinners were fine and were enjoyed.   One of the dinners were not able to be finished and my husband didn't like the cod on his plate.  So overall all, food was hit and miss.  The waitress was slow and nearly nonexistent.  In the end, the manager came over to the table and helped come up with a solution regarding two of the dinners.  She seemed concerned and listened to what happened.  My only guess is that there were not enough cooks on a busy holiday, mother's day or something was off in the kitchen entirely.  We will give them another chance and hopefully I'll be lucky to have Steve as my waiter.  I'll certainly ask to be seated in his area.",

It appeared there might have been a problem in the kitchen but no one came out to let us know.  Our food came finally came out and it was just alright.

Most of the serving containers were empty.  It wasn't even that busy! We had our young son with us who like most men, loves bacon. My husband stood up by the buffet for almost 15 minutes waiting for the bacon that many staff members said was coming.  Eventually someone said they ran out, 40 minutes after it had started... My husband returned to eat the plate of cold food, comprised of whatever he was able to find, about 1/3 of what was to be offered on the buffet.  We didn't even get to eat together. Total waste of time and money.  Would have been better off at McDonald's.   It was so bad I wouldn't even return for dinner.",

When we arrived we were told there was a 20 minute delay.  We were okay with that we went to the bar and ordered drinks.  The barmaid didn't know how to mix two of our drinks and had no resource to look it up. We told her how to make it.  Ewe then sat waiting for our table.  At 7:25 the hostess came looking for us using my first name but leaving out an important vowel so it took awhile to figure out she was looking for us.  She then showed us to our table which was a hightop which on my reservation I requested a regular table.  This was important as my friend had just had a hip replacement and it was very uncomfortable for her to sit at the hightop.  We were approached fairly quickly and we ordered waster and our dinners as we could see the place was busy.  Every once in awhile our server would stop and tell us our dinner were coming up.  After waiting over an hour we decided to leave. Our drinks were paid for at the bar  except for one that was ordered at the table. Our daughters said we will meet you at Cadillac Ranch and we will pay for the one drink.  We waited and waited and then went back into the restaurant to see what was the hold up.  The waiter had taken the credit card and went to find a manager, which took a long time actually she was standing behind us and never even introduced herself, I finally noticed her and asked if she was the manager and she replied yes.  We told her how upset we were and that we had reservations but they were sitting people without reservations.  She just stood there.  So we left.  She didn't offer to resolve the issue with maybe a gift card to come back or even a discount.  This is the last time I will darken there doors",

    "text": "Came here for Sunday Brunch on Easter Sunday 4/1/2018.  These guys did a tremendous job.  We have a dairy allergy in the family and they were very accommodating.  With simply explaining our issue and our daughters requirements the waitress took it upon her self to talk to the chef and have her own scrambled eggs made separately.  We also asked about deserts and the waitress and chef worked together to promptly whip something up.  In general the staff were overly friendly even on the busiest of weekends (Easter Sunday).  I would highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner and ESPECIALLY Sunday Brunch.  If I had a negative the area where they have the buffet was tight.  It was very crowded for people to get to the food and/of when some of the food ran out it was difficult for people to get out of the way of the waitress/cooks to get the new food in there.  It is a tight quarter and I'm not sure what they can/would do to help this - they probably are doing the best the can with the space they have - but this would be my only recommendation for improving the place.",

My favorite appetizer is the battered zucchini- we got this tonight and it was delicious.   I ordered a healthier dish, the balsamic grilled chicken. It was delightful and had fresh basil on top.   I always upgrade and get the strawberry balsamic salad. Highly suggest!   They also served three different items with our bread, two butters and a hummus. The cherry butter is surprisingly very good.   My husband likes the $4 long islands on Saturday.   A nice place to hang out!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for dinner with another couple.  Hubby and I ordered their mussels for an appetizer, Hubby ordered their WG Burger, and I ordered their caprese salad.  Total came out to a little over $40 (including tip).  What's Hot - Coupon when you check in on Yelp.  I received a 10% off coupon when I checked in on Yelp.  Definitely great and I loved that.  Additionally, this coupon didn't have any restrictions- like only valid during certain hours during certain days.  I've come across Yelp coupons like that, which weren't very convenient and I wasn't able to use them because of the restrictions.  Additionally, when I told our server about my Yelp coupon, there was no difficulty in having it honored.  Even better. - Quality.  Their mussels were flavorful and delicious!  There was plenty of juice soaking the mussels, as well, which I enjoyed and definitely drank up.  I loved the garlic flavor and bits of cut tomatoes in the juice.  My caprese salad had a decent serving of fresh mozzarella cheese and baby grape tomatoes with just enough balsamic dressing that didn't overpower my salad.  My husband really liked his WG Burger that came with candied bacon.   - Menu variety.  Their menu is a one page menu, which is pretty straightforward and simple.  Not overwhelming, which I like.   - Price.  My mussels are under $9.50, my salad was $12.50 and husband's burger was $13.50.  Not that bad. - Location.  It's conveniently located with the movie theatre around, other restaurants, shops, etc...  However, be prepared for parking issues during busy times/\"rush hour\".  What's Not - They have live music on Friday evenings.  Different strokes for different folks, but live music during a meal isn't my thing.  It was loud, which made it difficult for us to have a conversation.  We found out they usually have live music on Friday evenings until 8:30pm.  Just be aware and be prepared. - Service.  Service wasn't bad, but it was definitely slow.  We had to ask for bread sometime after they served our dinner, rather than it being given to us in the beginning.  I'm uncertain whether they're adequately staffed.  They have a service button/pager at our table, which we used a couple of times.  Our waiter was slow to answer.  Additionally, we had to regularly ask for our drinks to be refilled instead of getting automatic refills.  They also didn't ask us if we wanted more bread.    Observations - Make reservations.  This place isn't packed, but there are definitely \"rush hour\" times, when you have to wait.  There were about 10 people ahead of us.  My friend made dinner reservations for a specific booth, as well.     Final Answer - Willing to come back.  Good and dependable, but probably not a first choice.",

The restaurant is huge and has indoor and outdoor seating. It is very clean and well maintained. The restroom was clean as well. The service was good. I had the Huevos Rancheros and man was it deliciousss!! The flavors were great. The tostada along with potatoes, eggs, chipotle aioli, queso fresco and pico de gallo made one heck of a delicious brekky. 5 star for the dish. My husband had the creme brulee French toast that came with Breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were very tasty, cooked to perfection with nice seasoning. 5 star to that as well. The French toast is another story though. Not sure why they called it creme brulee because they tasted no different than a regular French toast. They were dry, flavorless and deserve 2 stars. All in all, a good dine in experience!! Just stay away from those French toast and you will have a great meal.",

I personally have never seen an offer this generous, so before even going here I felt impressed.  Even when I came into the driveway, the smell emanating from this restaurant drew me in. Then I looked at the menu. Prices were reasonable for a restaurant this fancy. As a seafood lover, I also appreciated seeing a plentiful array of seafood options avalable on the menu.  I ended up ordering seafood pasta. The portion was very big for me so it covered me for 2-3 separate meals. I also liked that the noodles were holow which allowed them to hold more of the sauce and seafood flavor. The sauce on the pasta was very light - with a little touch of lemon, butter and olive oil with mixed with the natural juices of the seafood. I really prefer that kind of a sauce over a heavier sauce since it allowed me to really savor the natural flavor of the seafood. They also didn't skimp on the seafood either - I loved the balance of mussels, clams, shrimp and calamari, especially the calamari, YUM!  Will be coming back here!",

Our server was not attentive. She forgot a drink order and we had to ask for refills on our drinks frequently.   Food - very good. The menu is extensive with many options for apps, salads flatbreads, sandwiches and entrees. I had the baked onion soup and parmigiana chicken and gnocchi. Both were very good.  Overall - very good.

Weird hand-written sign on the door that they were closing at 8:30 for mandatory cleaning.   I owned a restaurant, and know other people that owned them, and never have I seen a restaurant close early, and lose sales, in order to clean.   Cleaning is done after hours.    If you are a \"yelper\", do a check in and you can get 10% off your bill.  The menu is extensive, and they also had 2 other sheets of paper with specials, which gets to be too much for me.   Our server was quick to take our drink order, but slow to fill them, and the restaurant was fairly empty.    In the end, I opted for the tortellini.  There were 4 of us and the food came quickly, but 2 orders had their sides switched.  My tortellini was tasty, but not as hot as I would have liked.  The portion size was good.  Others had salmon and chicken and liked them.  The French onion soup was liked very much.  Service was really lacking.  She didn't come by to fill drinks and when we did catch her to order another beer, she forgot to bring it and we had to hunt her down.   It wasn't until we were paying our bill that we noticed there was a \"buzzer\" on the table that we could have used for service.     Since service was really the bigger issue, I would come back to try something else.",

I wasn't blown away whatsoever so I thought for sure I would never return to any location . I had a sudden change of heart this past weekend and decided to give the Robinson location a try.   Needless to say there was clearly a reason I said I didn't want to go back. The menu looks enticing with all of its options but the food is nothing special whatsoever. After much debating I decided to order a Bloody Mary with my brunch. I'm a Bloody Mary snob so I was very hesitant going into it until I saw what it looked like and it seemed like it could be half decent. Wrong again. It tasted like watered down Campbell's tomato soup. I couldn't even force it down it was so bad. As a Bloody Mary fanatic, it was a disgrace that they would even call that a Bloody Mary.   Food wise I decided to go with the biscuits and gravy. I thought surely they would have to be good if my work cafeteria can manage to make good biscuits and gravy. Wrong again. It didn't event look appetizing. The gravy looked as if they decided to be cheap and replace some of the cream/milk with water. It just didn't even look right. The biscuits didn't taste fresh at all and the eggs were most definitely not poached. Having a runny egg doesn't make it poached. The egg white shouldn't be completely cooked and rubbery.   With my recent experience it's safe to say I'm done giving any Walnut Grill a chance. If you enjoy good quality, homemade food I would not recommend it. The food doesn't taste fresh and at times doesn't even taste like they made it in-house.",

When it was delivered they had not grilled a piece of chicken for the salad, they had used the refrigerated chicken cubes that you get from the grocery store that are pre cooked - it was disgusting! Delivery is more expensive than eating in restaurant so it's not obscene to expect the same quality of food! I won't be eating here again!",

Hubby was happy with his meal as well. Not sure why the overall rating is low as this was a great experience!",

    "text": "We ordered two appetizers with our party.  The stuffed peppers were phenomenal.  The zucchini was ok.  I ordered a Pittsburgh grilled chicken salad, which was $10, I added chicken which was another $5.  When I received the salad, I was extremely disappointed. I thought I was receiving a full breast.  It was a handful of old bite-size cold chicken in my salad.  The whole table was amazed.  I was not going to complain but my mother-in-law told the waitress after she asked how our food was. The waitress was super nice and did not charge for the salad, in the end. She was extremely sweet.   I would be willing to give this place another shot, however; I would not order another Pittsburgh salad.",

I would have never picked this - just didn't pop off the menu to me. But hey, it came highly recommended. If you have a chance, try it. It was delicious! The restaurant was clean and the service was above-average.  This is definitely a place that's on my radar for a repeat visit when I'm on my way home from the airport.",

The server was very unknowledgeable and didn't pay attention to us even though we were literally the only table in his section. My husband's baked potato was burnt to a crisp (?) and our friend's cheeseburger was completely burnt and he couldn't eat it. The calamari appetizer was terribly mushy. I would never go back to this restaurant.",

($4 Long Island, $3 corona) can't beat that on a Saturday night. Desserts were amazing! Checked out menu while we were here, will definitely be back for food!",

    "text": "We had made a reservation several months ago for the patio for our family reunion kick off.  Although I had made the reservation for 6:30, when I called to confirm I was told it was for 6 pm.  Since those who were attending were getting into town early, this time worked.  Upon arrival, I was surprised that the tables were set up separately.  When I asked to have them put together so we can all be together to engage in family conversation, it was reluctantly done. Not sure what the issue was that made it so difficult to accommodate.  Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, the waitress forgot to put in 2 of the 15 orders.  Both orders were comped for their error, but that wasn't the point.  The food that was delivered was very good.",
