Otherwise, you can just order them like most of us who can't get to the East Coast anytime soon. Enrico's biscotti are legendary. Although the original recipes were for anise/almond and lemon biscotti (handed down from his grandma), Enrico has expanded his flavors to include white chocolate, cherry, cinnamon to name a few. Order these lovely treats from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.enricobiscotti.com&s=34f69ff8658f8b5479649548dfe43d0db4dcc431afc98d453f99c53afca4acb0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">enricobiscotti.com</a>",

We shared a chicken sandwich (which was made like a fold over) and a pepperoni roll. Our waiter was less than attentive. The owner, however, spent time chatting with us which made for a pleasant experience. we purchased biscotti to share with others back in Ohio however not many made it as we ate them on the way home!",

I don't even care for biscotti's because they are typically a challenge to eat and there are biscotti's galore in here...  The reason I came in here was because I wanted a sweet treat..,something other than chocolate.  I ordered the raspberry turnover which was pressed flat and not exactly crescent shaped as they typically tend to be.  This thing was delicious!  Dusted crystal sugar on top and flaky the way turnovers tend to be when they are so fresh.  The store is small and has variety of breads, dessert case with scones, brownies, cookies, turnovers, and much more.  The price here is slightly high but still within reason.  My treat was $2.50 and worth every cent!",

The cafe's atmosphere drew me in, with the exposed brick and various baking pans and large whisks hung off the scaffolding.  Now, after years of visits, Enrico's feels like home.   I was first impressed with the brick oven pizza.  Thin, baked to perfection, with a delicious crust.  Another friend who'd spent a month traveling in Italy look for the perfect slice said that Enrico's pizza rivaled everything he'd tried that summer.  My favorite pizza is the white pizza with gorgonzola and dried cranberries.  They're always happy to make it for me, even when it's not listed on that day's menu.  On the menu, I saw the listings for the First Friday dinners and the bread class.  They only serve dinner during these special dinner nights (Now including the Big Italian Throwdown at the last Friday of every month.) And, wow, what a dinner and a deal. The best time to go is in the summer and early fall when all the veggies are fresh and local. You pay $50 (BYO) for a 4 or 5 course dinner that is incomparable. (Highlights: a peach and tomato salad with basil and balsamic, and the short ribs)  The bread class:  $50 for a Sunday afternoon at Enrico's.  It seems expensive but it was worth it.  You're served brunch in addition to learning how to bake the bread.  We left with enough leftovers that it made the price worth it.  My husband has been baking bread in this style ever since.    If you haven't been here, you should stop by and try it.  Bring some wine to share. They're open for lunch every day of the week.",

The biscotti is pretty damn good, but the staff seem to be TRAINED to act annoyed, uninterested, arrogant and condescending.    We go to the Strip twice a month.  Love shopping down there.  A visit to EB three weeks ago was our last one.    My wife inquired about the price of an almond specialty that has varied in price over the last few months.  The clerk -- a middle-aged guy -- made an audible sigh and rolled his eyes before answering.  That, to me, was a pretty clear \"f--- you\" from the staff.  IF the price had been posted, I MIGHT understand the reaction...  And that's only one of what's been a regular series of events with EB.   And for us, it's been the last.  I'll buy biscotti from the vendors in front of Penn Mac.   At least they act as if they care about their patrons.    I wish 'em luck.  I really do.",

The food is really delicious - high quality, fresh ingredients.  The sandwiches come on incredible bread. (Gotta check out the bread baking classes...) The salads are great and lightly dressed.  My favorite lunch combo is the beans and greens along with an arugula salad.  With the bread and olive oil that they give you to start, it makes the perfect light lunch.  Stop in the bakery on the way out for a biscotti or a coconut macaroon.",

I love biscotti and was hoping to be a regular customer.  Unfortunately the awful customer service stopped me from buying anything and ever returning again.  My car was parked in front of the store while they were hosing off the sidewalk.  Keeping the place clean is very respectable and when they were done they should have taken two seconds to hose off the side of my car which was now covered with dirt.  Unfortunately they did not hose it off.  The guy with the hose was still outside and watering plants so I go inside the cafe and explain to the guy behind the counter what happened and if he can please use the hose to spray the car.  He looks at me like I am crazy.  Another employee goes outside and asks the guy to hose off my car who then says it will be five minutes and calls me an asshole.  They get dirt all over my car and dont wash it off and the guy is still outside and easily could take two seconds to wash it off, but wont and I am the asshole.  Nice way to treat your customers.",

My friends wife had recommended it to us, otherwise I do not know that we would have noticed it as I have walked by many times without noticing it.  The entrance to it is cute and invokes a little side street bistro in Europe complete with string lights.  We decided to start off our meal with some coffees.  It was easy to tell it wasn't mass produced, had a great taste and was strong too.  For our entrees I decided upon the pollo sanwheech while my girlfriend had the pesto.  My sanwheech consisted of cooked pizza dough flipped over to make a sandwich with field greens, chicken, mushrooms and a piece of pepperoni a side.  It was interesting with the pizza dough as bread and I enjoyed it.  My girlfriends pesto was also one of the better tasting that I had tried recently.  The good food is only half the reason to go as the atmosphere is cool as well.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  The food was good and the ambience even better.",

    "text": "After an exhausting rowing practice, I invited a friend to join me for lunch at the cafe at The Enrico Biscotti Company in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I should note that I've have been here a handful of times, always enjoying each each experience.  I consider myself adventurous when it comes to trying different things, but similar to when I dine at Olive or Twist, I always order the same thing when at Enricos - the beans and greens. I love this dish, especially since I make it at home and I enjoy their variation (made with kale) just as much as I enjoy my own  (generally with escarole). Priced at $9, you receive a healthy portion of greens and beans in a delicious broth. As an accompaniment, they serve a small portion of bread to sop up all the broth as you make your way through the meal. For an additional $1, you can order a fried egg to be placed on top. For $2, they'll serve a moderately sized piece of chicken breast. I ordered both!  Not served with, but something you can ask for are red pepper flakes to top the dish. On this particular occasion, I did ask for them, but unfortunately the waitress never returned. I was too hungry to wait and had to get to a hair appointment, so I chowed down. After realizing that she forgot to bring the flakes over to the table, the waitress apologized and noted that she'd take the meal off the menu. I really didn't think that was necessary, but it was a really kind offer and I didn't refuse her gesture.  If you haven't been here, keep in mind that there are only 2 and 4 top tables. The location is tiny and I do not recommend dining here with groups larger than 4.",

    "text": "This review is for the cafe only. The bakery looks really good and I will be sure to post an updated review once I've tried it.  I occasionally come here for lunch as I work nearby in the Strip District. It's located slightly off the main Penn Ave drag and has a few cafe tables situated in a sweet little alleyway and then a cozy cafe lies just beyond that. They've apparently begun producing wines; I tried a white and it was very raw tasting. I do admire their creative and entrepreneurial spirit, however!  Their pizzas have a tasty, thin, wood-fired crust. The margherita is just OK, with a minimally or un-seasoned San Marzano tomato base, a few slices of fresh mozzerella cheese and (twice this has been presented to me this way, so I assume it is a conscientious preparation decision rather than indicative of a shortage) about three small shards of basil. I ask for parmesan and that makes it more palatable. But truly, this is a spartan sort of pizza. I think they need to amp up the ingredients.  Service seems fine.",

We first looked at the historic diners (& walked right past the massive lines). I'm so glad- we glanced over & saw this little doorway tucked back off the street. I've lived in Italy for a year, I was immediately intrigued & excited.  Enrico's did not dissappoint. We were greeted by the cheerful staff, seated quickly- the place was bustling, full of chatting/eating patrons & smelled ahhhh-mazing. We were quickly greeted by our waitress, drinks served just as quickly & our food arrived promptly after we ordered. I had the smoked salmon plate,  my bf had the white truffle mushroom scramble, his father had the sausage stata, his mum had the featured sausage & apple hash--all of it...Y.U.M. We didn't converse much-- we were too busy sharing & enjoying eachother's dishes. Our server was efficient, attentive, cheerful (our drinks were never empty). The entire staff was enthusiastic & genuinely happy to see us.   Clearly this is a restaurant full of an entire staff who love their jobs & genuinely enjoy providing this amazing food to their guests- we are absolutely coming back next visit.",

They serve wine! I ordered the sweet wine, which wasn't very sweet and was served warm. The pizza I chose to get was quattro formaggio. The dough was chewy and not crispy, which was fine. I think the cheese weighed down the crust because there was a lot of grease on that pizza. The gorgonzola used on the pizza was a bit on the sweeter side and was delicious. I think next time I will try the pasta. Oh and make sure to stop inside and get dessert. So many delicious flavors of biscotti and other sweet treats.",

They don't usually take reservations, but they hooked us up when I called earlier that morning. Food was very authentic Italian (I've been to Italy twice).

Back then I was still hooked on the Macaroons (which I still love) but now I have unfortunately gotten hooked on so much more.  Their Ricotta Pie is like no other.  For breakfast, for dessert, whatever the occasion, it fits!  Torte Rusitco- the Italian Quiche- the first time I had this I came back to Chicago searching and searching for one like it and a year and a half later I am still searching.  Thankfully I will be back in Pittsburgh next week so this will definitely be my carry on for the flight home!   Lemon Tarte- I love lemon and this one is a great classic with the perfect amount of tartness and a flaky crust.    I cant wait to see what I find in the pastry case on my next trip...maybe something with Chocolate!",

    "text": "Visited The Enrico Biscotti based upon an Anthony Bourdain review of Pittsburgh places you had to visit. We walked into the cozy bakery and were immediately greeted by amazing smells, visual overload of pastries that all looked too good to eat and a staff that was warm, inviting and extremely helpful. The young man behind the counter asked if we had any questions and made some suggestions to us as we perused the options. Given the name, a biscotti was definitely in the cards and the chocolate chip coconut biscotti proved to be a great selection. The biscotti had the crunch you'd hope for and had a smooth and rich taste to It. The coconut was soft and matched the chocolate nicely. The other selection was for the lemon blueberry scone which offered a zesty component to the sweet blueberry and pastry flavors. The scone was delicate and rich and paired well with a coffee.  Prices were very reasonable and we could have spent a lot more there as the entire bakery had options that likely would have been as good as the two we selected. There was a cannoli cake which was a round cake with cannoli filling in the middle, chocolate and cake topped with a whole cannoli that I will be having good dreams about; would love to here a Pittsburgh review of this cake!",

This is clearly the best kept breakfast secret in the Strip.  No wait here as we walk by Pamela's and Deluca's with lines running down the street.    The menu was great and both Catherine and I had trouble deciding what to order.  Catherine had the Egg Strata and I had a rustic egg and aged meat pastry with and beautiful flaky crust. We both had slices of their thick cut bacon.  LaPrima coffee was excellent.  Ambiance was perfect - old strip location made me feel like nothing has changed since the 40s.  Feel of authentic Italian cafe (not that I've ever been to Italy!).  We will be making this our regular Breakfast stop in the Strip.",

    "text": "Have you ever been served by someone who's drunk? Well....I have....   I'm not talking about your drunk friend wobbling over to hand you a plate of food out of her kitchen. Or the bartender who's drinking along with you. I'm talking about an actual server at a restaurant...for lunch.   If I didn't find it so amusing I would have been SO irritated. Thankfully, it's just one of those times you're just a spectator in a funny comedy of errors. I've been served by this woman before, and it seems that she may be an owner or manager. Someone who's obviously able to imbibe on the wine during work hours. Oh, and she was definitely tipsy last time...this time....it was party time drunk!   So Drunky McDrunkster kept forgetting to bring us our drinks, our water and our bread. She also messed up our orders by forgetting what they were and then running back to find out what we had asked for. Then our orders came and both my friends \"sangaweeches\" where wrong. They were gracious enough to just eat them and not care. They agreed that they weren't bad, but they weren't t life changing either. Everyone wants a life changing meal!   I've been here once before for lunch as well and wasn't too impressed. I got the pasta vodka the first time and it was ok. Not mind blowing...obviously how I like my pasta to be!   This time I just ordered an anti pasta salad. I thought it was an interesting twist to add dried cranberries and walnuts with absolutely no cheese (boo!). The bread was actually really delish! That was probably my favorite part...well...other than the drunk server.   The really surprising part about McDrunkster is that the wine they sell is NOT good. They've started to make their own and it just tasted as if the ingredients didn't mesh like they should. I've meet a couple wine's I don't particularly like, but I've never meet a wine I can't even stand to sip. I'll take my cheap Yellow Tail if that's the case!   So more power to you lady, if you can enjoy your job, with a bottle of wine included daily. I just don't think I'll be back to eat. Maybe just spectate!",

I cannot count the number of times that the wife and I have walked past the Enrico side path and mentioned to each other that we should give it a try...  we'll, we finally did.  Overall, the staff was very welcoming when we arrived.  We were quickly seated and our drinks were brought out in no time.  While we loved the small, cozy and unique space, I didn't love that fact that my coffee mug was both broken (chipped on the rim and cracked down the side) and soiled (lip stick on the rim).  I asked for another mug and one was quickly brought out nonetheless.  When it came to the food, I ordered the breakfast strata per the waitress's suggestion and the wife ordered the breakfast risotto.  At this point I had low expectations (actually no expectations...  I had no idea what would come out), so I was pleasantly surprised when my dish was quite good.  Awesome combination of good  soft bread w/ crusty edges and a smooth center coupled with syrup (thankfully that was included, otherwise the dish would of been lacking).  While I was pleased with my meal, my wife's risotto overall was pretty bland (it needed a heap of salt and pepper to make it attractive to eat).  While we love Enrico's biscotti, I'd have to think again if we'd revisit the cafe.  We left feeling satisfied with what we had eaten, but definitely in no way impressed.",

A little salt and spice would go a very long way.  The white pizza we shared was really nice, and I loved that they use real olive.  The marinara and the price however prompt me to give them a 3 over a four. But check it out and try something other than a marinara pizza and it might be worth it.",

    "text": "The Enrico Biscotti Company's cafe is by far my favorite place for weekend lunch in Pittsburgh. It's not open in the evenings, otherwise it would be my favorite dinner place too! I've come here with friends and a bottle of wine for a long, relaxing lunch and with my mother for a takeout lunch before running errands. Whatever the situation, this lovely establishment never disappoints. The people who work here are friendly, and the space is small but not cramped. They have the sweetest little patio for the warmer months too.   Enrico's keeps their menu pared down, and that's a huge part of their success. Having traveled in Italy, I often crave the delicious simplicity of Italian cuisine. The food at Enrico's always satisfies me in this regard. They offer a few small pizzas, some sandwiches, a salad, and beans and greens. The latter two dishes can be ordered topped with roast chicken or a fried egg. Everything is absolutely wonderful. The salad (with chicken) would have to be my favorite however. As my friends would tell you, I'm never the first one at the table to order a salad...I prefer heartier foods as a general rule. Enrico's salad is too delicious and filling to pass up though, so I keep coming back for it. It's got a good mix of dark leafy greens (no iceberg in sight!) and the chicken compliments it so well. I order mine sans cheese, but it typically comes topped with that also. Whatever you order has a piece of Enrico's heavenly bread on the side...they even teach classes so you can replicate the deliciousness and take fresh bread home with you. Sign me up!",

Lemon and cinnamon are our house favorites. Entering my humble abode with my bi-weekly, two bag order from Enrico's biscotti, you would think I was returning from a multi-year military campaign, ushered in with a hero's welcome, celebrated as though I conquered ISIS, North Korea, and Nickleback all in one battle.   But seriously, this biscotti is the real deal. Saddle up with some strong coffee (or splurge on some whole milk if you're my kid), and enjoy.  Oh yeah, the coconut macaroons are the jam, too. Those don't make it home. Mama has got to do Mama sometimes.",

I was super psyched to eat some biscotti - we got a half dozen, and they were very well priced (like $7.50 for six, i think?)  All well so far.  So then we get home, eat dinner, and we are pumped for dessert.  How surprised and disappointed we were to find that the biscotti were totally plain.  Though we had gotten six different, very unique-sounding flavors, we could not distinguish one from the other.  The texture was great, but it tasted like what I can only describe as \"plain biscotti.\"  I'd love to give more stars to a local business, but like....it was just plain.  Barely a hint of flavor.  I'm totally not making this up or trying to be bratty or snobby - I'm not exaggerating at all.  The stuff was totally boring.  I see another reviewer here said exactly what I said, so I know it isn't just me.  Maybe we've been on a bad day?  I'd be willing to give it one more try, but if it's plain again - then me and Enrico's are done.",

The macadamia white chocolate is my favorite.  The other baked goods leave a bit to be desired in my opinion.  That said, what you really don't want to miss is the tiny restaurant tucked behind the bakery.  You'll feel like you're in on the best kept secret in the Burgh when you sneak down the narrow sidewalk and step down into the rustic kitchen dining room.  You'll be seated  at one of the few tables lined against a brick wall opposite giant mixers and bakery ovens.  The service is warm, friendly and casual like you're in your auntie's Italian kitchen.  The menu is small but right on target.  The homemade pizzas are deliciously simple and the \"big fat salad\" is more balanced and satisfying than those found at Enrico's upscale counterparts.    I'm a fan of marble tabletops, smart looking waiters, and trendy tempuras but I'll take a consistently satisfying lunch at Enrico over them almost any day.",

    "text": "*I have died and gone to heaven.\"  Mark my grave with biscotti from Enrico's.   My review is based on a whirlwind less than 48 hour trip to the 'Burgh that had me eating whenever and where ever something looked tasty.  I made a purchase here for dessert to take back for that night and biscotti for the plane ride the next day.  And a little nibble in the car on the way home (geez, so I suck a tiny bite... w/e!)  I got a total of 2 biscotti and 2 chocolate oblivion minis (3 bite sizes of flourless chocolate cake).  + 1 Star - Variety.  I mean, who knew that there were over 20 types o biscotti made here - and most are available every day.  Variety is the spice of bakery life. + 1 Star - Staff.  How pleasant and funny and knowledgeable.  Every one of them (I chatted with 3) has not just the ingredients committed to memory, but little tales to tell about this flavor and that. Lovely and engaged bakers make for fat, happy eaters o biscotti. + 1 Star.  Quality.  I was a little wary that the biscotti would be like shingles, as that is what biscotti always taste like.  Not here, my friend. Here they are as the bakery gods intend biscotti to be - edible with coffee or other dunkables, but also sheer delight on their own.  And that is 90% to do with the excellent ingredients. +1 Star - The other stuff.  Like I said, I bought two small flourless cake-lettes.  OMG and I never eat desserts.  Thank heavens I don't live in the 'Burgh or I would be here at least weekly.  Or more, as they are across from the yoga studio I like (Bikram!). + 1 Star - Price.  Did I mention I bought 2 biscotti and 2 mini-cakes for $5!!!! WTF???!! Amazingly cheap.  I really should have bought more. - 1 Star - Regret.  That I didn't buy more to take back home with me.  I am still weeping over that.  Yes, I can order online, but it's not... the... same....  I never have a need to go back to Pittsburgh, but I may have to concoct one to go here.  This was my dream-come-True bakery.  Sigh.",

    "text": "EB is the place to go to escape the hustle that is the strip district on a Saturday afternoon. While waiting in what seemed like a never ending line for Deluca's, I noticed a small sign across the street that said breakfast and lunch served here. I hurried across the street to check it out while the ladies continued to wait in line. I first entered the bakery and was engulfed by the sight and aroma of fresh baked treats. Before I realized it, I was part of a line to order. Oh what the heck. Might as well get a few biscotti while I'm here. So many flavors to choose from! I was also enticed by the croissants but decided to hold out seeing I had yet to eat lunch. After ordering my biscotti, I asked about lunch service and was directed to go around the side of the building and to the back. As I walked to the back, I was transported to a small cafe in Italy complete with an open kitchen and small tables outside the restaurant. The decor drew me in, I didn't even need to see the menu. I quickly ran to the street and waved the ladies over. We were immediately seated and given the lunch menu (11:45). Oh, no breakfast options? Oh well, lunch looked amazing. I ordered the original sangweech with italian meats, mozzarella, sauce and field greens. The ladies decided to both get the margherita pizza. Our lunches arrived quickly and I eagerly dug in. The bread used for the sangweech was pizza dough. So, imagine a pizza with italian meats, cheese, topped with field greens folded in half. That's a sangweech. A near perfect sandwhich. My only criticism is that there seemed to be a lot of field greens and not much sauce. If the field greens were dressed with an italian dressing, this sangweech would be a home run. After eating half, I decided to pack up the other half and take it home so that I had room for dessert. Our server chatted off the list of bakery items available. I chose the chocolate croissant. Kudos to me on an incredible choice. Light, flaky, smooth chocolate. This could have easily been something I had purchased from a french bakery on my recent trip to Paris. I was hooked. If you're in the strip and what a different experience from the loud and over crowded shops, sneak back to EB. You won't be disappointed.",

The breakfast menu was not your usual fare but a eclectic selection items such as Greens, eggs  and ham,  a breakfast salad with an egg on top and a homemade granola.  There were many other items that had a Italian theme.  The Cafe is a small venue between two buildings that is by no means fancy but has a rustic feeling. I only gave the place three stars because service was uneven but very friendly. Also my one son didn't get any bread. They forgot.

Everything ranges from about $6-10.  Both my partner and I got the 1/2 sandwich special, her opting for the pumpkin soup abreast her roasted red pepper artichoke sandwich.  I went for the beans & greens next to my \"original\" sandwich that included salami and two other types of sausage with some good provolone and greens.  The flat bread used for the sandwiches (which I assume they also use for pizza) was fabulous and easily the highlight of my meal.  I really liked the atmosphere, they cram about 6-7 4-person tables and as many 2-person tables into half of their kitchen where they're making biscotti as well as your lunch!  Service was very likeable.  Overall I had a fantastic time.  Maybe a bit on the pricey side for lunch, while not out of line, I would rather pay $8 or 9 for a soup and sandiwch as opposed to $10.

They did a perfect job balancing the flavors and keeping serving sizes manageable so you can truly enjoy each dish! For this dinner we rented out the restaurant.  My second trip was in this summer, 2012. Another fantastic five course dinner for a birthday celebration with a large group. We did not have the entire restaurant to ourselves. The set up is one very long table that you share with another party and then one smaller long table you can share as well. This is great if you are social and enjoy chatting with other people enjoying the same food too!  The multiple courses are fabulous and exciting (you don't know what you are getting until it is right in front of you!) Another bonus... they have the ability to adapt to allergies - such as gluten free diets.   I am just waiting for another opportunity to go. I believe it is around $50 per person, which is great for what you get. BYOB!",

They came with a creamy curry sauce instead of typical marinara-- so good. We then went into the bakery next door and got sfolgiatelle for dessert. Now, I am a sfolgiatelle snob (grew up eating them from a great Italian bakery in Western Mass.) and these were tiny but very very good. Now if they would only make pasticiotti.",

    "text": "A little slice of biscotti heaven. With only 30 minutes to spare in the Strip District, we set out to find some sweets for the evening's dinner. Enrico nearly fell in our lap as we trotted up the block. It was either the smell of butter pouring out the front door or the cozy \"what's going in on there?\" street appeal that lured us in. Between the two of us we purchased everything from pumpking and fig and walnut biscotti to cannolis, lemon basil shortbread cookies, cream puffs and chocolate espresso tea cookies. Needless to say, this is the perfect place to visit if you find yourself en route to a tea-loving Italian family's house for dinner. Almost every dessert we purchased was crafted for dunking.   This place is pretty cozy. Rumor has it they have a mini cafe with seating in the back (behind the kitchen).",

I tried a bite right after a bought it and it was baked perfectly - crunchy, but not hard to eat. When I went to finish the rest of it a couple of hours later, it was already kind of stale, which meant buying some to bring home was not an option. So if you do go to Enrico's, my advice would be to enjoy the biscotti immediately!",

The place we were going to had a line out the door, but we saw a sign for breakfast across the street. We'd had Enrico's biscotti before, so we figured what the heck.   When we asked what's for breakfast, the hostess/server handed us a hand-written menu on the back of a lunch paper bag.   We asked Enrico if he makes whatever he feels like for breakfast? He answered with a smile, \"My house, I can do what I want.\"  Hubby had French toast and I had the breakfast carbonara, which is pasta loaded with bacon, egg, and cheese.   Another customer asked the server how many slices of French toast, and Enrico answered, \"How many you want? How's that for an answer?\"  The homestyle, tasty food and down-home feel will definitely bring us back.",

They offer numerous varieties of double baked biscotti, all of which are fantastic.  I have my favorites, mostly all are Anise based, but the varieties are so vast.  Peanut butter chocolate, black pepper walnut, pistachio, almond, cranberry...you name it, they have it.  They also offer some other baked goods and bread.     Super friendly staff that is always willing to assist you.   This is a place I always stop at when in the strip.   It is a great place if you are in the mood for some italian biscotti.",

It's like something you would see in Europe; it's pretty tiny inside. I really love the outdoor seating area! The pizza is wood fired and I'm a girl who loves the wood fired pizza life! They are not stingy on the basil or mozzarella, overall it tastes delish :)  Now onto the dessert. I have tried their macaroons and biscotti. The macaroons are pretty good and big in size. There are three different ones, almond, coconut and chocolate dipped coconut. I would have to say the coconut one is my favorite! The biscotti on the other hand fell short for me. I know some biscotti can be pretty solid and others are easier to bite into. These ones are pretty solid, and for me personally I can't get onboard with chipping a tooth. I have had biscotti from other places that I would definitely choose over Enrico's.",

It was about $13 including tax and tip for a lunch portion of pasta.  Our server was very friendly, and he immediately brought out a DELICIOUS loaf of bread and oil.  I could have made a meal of the bread alone.  I ended up ordering a pasta dish (name is lost) with red peppers, basil, and plenty of cheese!  It was a great portion for lunch; I was pleasantly stuffed at the end of the meal.    When our server brought our bill, we each got a cute mini biscotti.  With Biscotti in the restaurant name, you expect the biscotti to be some of the best.  This biscotti was definitely great.  The flavor was delicious, and it was fresh.  Who wants to break a tooth on biscotti?  Not me.  Our server was really friendly, and authentically Italian in his flirtatious nature.  It's not \"fast\" service, but it was good service.  We tried to order cannolis from the bakery twice, but both days we went, they were completely out by lunch time on a week day.  Bummer!  I'd still love to try one, but I probably will only try once more to get one.  It seems like lunch time is awfully early to be out of such a common Italian dessert.  I will definitely make a return to Enrico's!",

The store front is so inviting, hip, nice selection of pastries but obviously biscotti is their specialty so that is what my husband and I bought. We should have just picked up a few to try our mistake was buying a dozen.  I asked what their best sellers were and all the best sellers are dipped in chocolate. I really wanted to taste their twice baked biscuits flavor profiles without the chocolate distraction so we bought an assortment of different flavors. After my first bite..... I knew why their best sellers are dipped in chocolate.   The biscotti are visually beautiful, texturally they are traditionally hard and toothsome (definitely need to dip these cookies in liquid) they are traditional even in their sugar/flour ratio but that doesn't mean they should be flavorless?? You could not pick out the almond, anise or orange flavors they were suppose to contain. In all honesty these were the most bland flavorless biscotti I have ever tried. My husband also thought they were equally as boring and the dozen biscotti were unfortunately thrown in the bin. I really wanted to like this place too. Maybe their other confections are more flavorful but I would not recommend the biscotti.",

Tucked in the alleyway next to Enrico Biscotti bakery , the cafe is easy to pass up as it's not well marked but if you happen to spot it you will be glad you did! The atmosphere I'd describe as rustic-you can see into the kitchen, the walls are brick and filled with pictures, it's very quaint. Both of my dining companions ordered the beans and greens-kale,canellini beans, garlic, and olive oil sauteed together-one added a fried egg to it,while the other added both a fried egg and chicken. They both finished the plates raving about it-also saying the rustic bread served with it was delicious too. I ordered the fig jam and mozzarella pizza. While only being a four cut pizza, it was a large four cut pizza but was so tasty I finished the entire thing! The fig jam added a unique sweetness to the pie and the mozzarella used on the pizza was excellent quality. The crust was thin and fluffy-very light. Many of the pastas looked good as did some of the sandwiches. This was authentic Italian at it's best. The owner was there as well and was very friendly. I've also tried the   rabbit ragu that was to die for and a prosciutto, mozzerella, tomato pizza that was excellent! It's usually a wait but never too bad. Seating can be very cramped at times-just be warned.",

I chose the scrambled eggs with truffles, my partner chose the strata, we both ordered coffee and of course we had to order one of the thirty something biscottis they offer; we went with the chocolate almond drizzled with white chocolate. I asked for cream for my coffee, but they didn't have any, nor did they have soy or non-fat so they brought whole milk.   Our biscotti was delicious, my eggs were so-so; the truffles were great, but I really like hot sauce on my eggs and they didn't have any, this shocked me. The server offered to bring me a side of red pepper flakes and that improved the eggs, but it's not the same. How can you serve eggs and not have hot sauce somewhere? On a positive note: The bread served with my eggs was very good. My partner hated her strata and said she couldn't taste the bacon inside of it so rather than being savory and sweet it was just too sweet.   Overall I enjoyed this place because the servers were nice and the atmosphere was pleasant. However, we probably wouldn't eat another meal here since we didn't love the food, but we would stop in for a biscotti and coffee.",

The antithesis of this would be the people working in the bakery. Fillings and flavorings in items are sometimes almost nonexistent, especially in things that you can't see like croissants and ravioli. Some of the cookies crumble in your hand before you can even get them to your mouth. While the bread is usually pretty consistent, the bakery items(?), not so much. My wife loves the biscotti but I personally have a hard time telling the difference between one and another as regards to flavor, unless it is chocolate, and then all the chocolates pretty much taste the same. They are dry and crumbly and a completely different texture than almost all other types. If you haven't had them before, don't buy a dozen at first, just go with a few to see if it is what you want.",

    "text": "Delicious breakfast in the Strip District! We loved walking around the Strip District on a recent Saturday morning, and had been encouraged to have breakfast at Enrico's. We were not disappointed. Well ... a *tad* disappointed to find out that the *bread bakery* was out of bread to make French Toast. Nevertheless, we persisted! The biscuits and gravy were luscious and just sinful. We felt vindicated by following them up with green eggs and ham (fried eggs over kale with ham & white beans). Fiber cancels out fat, amiright? ;) The service was fantastic! Super cool to see the wood fired oven. Would def come again over future visits to PGH!",

Crisp, flavorful and very, very tasty. Well made, they hold up well despite a brief dip in the coffee cup and then a munch. Perhaps a little crumbly but that's what a biscotti is supposed to do.  I got an assortment. Walnuts, chocolate, almonds, all sorts of great stuff. I don't have a favorite - they were all excellent!",

I think I was a bit overwhelmed by all the choices and also because we didn't have enough time in the shop I randomly chose a Walnut Biscotti which was really dry and just not too my taste palate.   I did like that they sold a decent size brown bag of broken biscotti for $7 and that way you could try a whole bunch and find a flavor combo that works for you, so I reckon that's what I will do at my next visit. Unfortunately this visit, the biscotti just didn't do it for me!  Yelp Review 67/ 2017",

He mentioned scones and biscotti, so I had the idea to place a to go order with Enrico for the items. My husband picked it up, and the baked goods simply blew my mind.  Since then, I've tried to come to the shop multiple times on my own, but it has been closed. Finally, this past Sunday, I was able to get in! The bakery's storefront is filled to the brim with pre-made bags of biscotti, dozens of flavors of biscotti sitting in glass jars throughout the shop, and a case filled with scones and other baked treats. We selected one flavor of biscotti (Coconut Chocolate) and three flavors of scones. Though none of the flavors were life-changing like they were with my first order a couple years ago, everything was delicious and perfectly made. Next time, I really need to try some of their other baked goods. The sample of peanut butter cookie sitting on the counter was amazing!!",

The taste of the coffee is always a giveaway as to the quality of the food and the cappuccino was perfection! The breakfast menu is not a light menu so go hungry! My friend had the carbonara (yes! Pasta for breakfast) and I had the torta rustics (quiche). The textures were so interesting.  Creamy eggs, Italian meats, ricotta cheese and I even think hard boiled eggs.  The portion was huge, but before I knew it, I had eaten the entire piece.  Awesome place.",

After we bought some necessities at Penn Mac, I thought it would be fitting to grab some biscotti.   Walking in, you are surrounded by the smells of an old Italian bakery.  Multiple flavors of biscotti await your purchase - if only I could buy them all!  We selected the chocolate almond, black forest, oatmeal,  and orange cranberry nutmeg (I think that's what it was called).  These double baked cookies are flavorful and crunchy, just like you'd want in a good biscotti.  I noticed a sign above the counter that said \"If you come in at 10am (pajamas allowed), you can learn how to make this biscotti...\"  For  $85, you can learn from the biscotti master and take home your creation!  That's a perfect date night (or morning)!  I know the hubs and I will be signing up for that class and learning how to make amazing biscotti.  My dad and I had a great trip to the strip and he got to take home something sweet from Enrico.  It was a great day!",

I got the fig jam pizza and wish that it had maybe not quite as much fig jam, and had a salty meat to go with the sweetness, but it was still good. It just wasn't exactly what I was in the mood for that day. The crust was amazing though.  The cafe is tiny. It will have a wait, but they try to clear things fast and once you order, your food will be made quickly. The staff is super friendly and makes the whole place feel like home. It's a little crowded, but it's not like you're on top of the next table. I'd be willing to try brunch, but it might be hard to not just order pizza every time.   The actual store is awesome. I love the biscotti. There are so many flavors. The other desserts that I've had were good too, but I mostly focus on the biscotti.",

I was a little unclear on where to go/order/get seating, but thankfully someone approached us and asked what we wanted, so we ordered our coffees and then got a seat. Someone kindly wiped down our table, and I asked our waiter for a water. He came back to tables around us several times....still no coffee or water. Maybe 10 minutes later, he apologized and said our lattes were coming....so I asked for water a second time. When he brought our lattes I asked for water a third time. Still no water. He came back to check on us when my husband was finished with his biscotti and coffee and I was halfway done and my husband reminded him about my water. I finally got my water about 25 minutes in. So that was not really great.   But besides that, it was tasty, the servers were nice, and the environment is amazing. The exposed brick and lights make for a really nice escape from the busyness of the Strip. Definitely would like to go back and get some food. Hopefully my server will bring my water next time.",

    "text": "This review is for the bread making class. I had heard great things from a few friends about their Sunday brunch + bread making class and had been wanting to try forever! I finally pulled the trigger, splurged the $85 per person and reserved a spot for my husband and I. So so glad to have this experience!   We walked in to the cafe and there was a long table with wine, water, and table settings for about 14 others. We were greeted and showed where the coffee was which was needed at 10am. A few short minutes later we were given an overview of our morning - brunch first followed by bread making and the history of bread told throughout. The staff began to promptly pass around brunch which was served family style and it was seriously amazing - so so SO much food and an endless supply of both red and white homemade wine.   Today's brunch was sausage with potatoes and peppers, penne with red sauce, lox and hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, berry French toast and bacon, breakfast quiche, and breakfast risotto with poached eggs. The quantities alone made my mouth drop- there was more than enough to go around for everyone + seconds (if you can finish your first plate). The food was incredible - the absolute best French toast I've ever tasted and the breakfast risotto was outstanding. I don't even know what was in it but I know I'll have dreams about it for a long time.   All the while, you're being told stories of the history of bread while you're eating and drinking and the staff is incredibly friendly, catering to you along the way but staying silent enough so you can be captivated in the story of bread.   Then we moved to the kitchen and began making our loaves. Each person makes their own rustic Italian loaf. The dough is prepared in advancebut the rest of the forming and baking is up to you (and as I learned there is much to it to get the perfect loaf)! Once your Italian loaf is in the oven, if there's time you also make focaccia and there are a plethora of toppings to go with it.   While the bread is baking, you then learn how the dough is actually prepared and how you can translate these techniques to baking the bread at home (not in a beautiful wood fired stove). Once the bread is finished you take the fruits of your labor home and that's a wrap!   Honestly it was an amazing experience and I'd love to do it again (even for just the food). Between my husband and I we left full, happy, learned some interesting history about different cultures and their experiences with bread, and with 4 loaves that we baked in the shop. It was one of my favorite activities I've done in the city and most certainly worth the money (especially if you're a wine drinker)! Would absolutely recommend for couples, friends, family to try it together -you'll leave feeling so cultured! Very much looking forward to returning to the cafe for brunch and trying another one of Enricos classes in the future!",

Everything they make is baked fresh on the day on premise. Their breads, croissants, and cakes are just off the charts and not comparable to anywhere else because most of the recipes go back generations. The almond cake is ridiculous. The buckeyes are addictive. And the dog loves the dog biscotti.  The big surprise is the lunch they provide in the back. By the time breakfast is over, the kitchen in the back is transformed to a lunch spot with a simple but phenomenal menu of Italian classics. My favorite? The spaghetti carbonara as prepared by Larry himself. Nothing like it.  Give Larry a big hug from his buddy in Vegas when you go see him. Enrico's is a True classic.",

What I adored was that as we browsed the menu, Enrico himself sat at the entrance working/relaxing.  He encouraged us to just go in, sit down, they will make you whatever you want.   We chose to sit in the alley area.   It was a bit chilly, but so worth the ambiance.   I ordered the sausage risotto served with a sunny side up egg on top. My husband had the biscuits and sausage gravy.     Both were incredible.   Portion was great.   Slightly pricey, but truly worth every penny!!!",

They also sell pastries that are very good. I have never been here for brunch, but I do recommend this place if you're in the mood for something sweet.

We had \"Sanga weeches\" that were great!  The bread was basically fresh pizza dough folded over and it was perfect, I mean perfect!  The flour is just that perfect golden brown, and almost black, but not burnt black, just perfect black.....  You know, this guy nailed it!  It was an Italian with ham salami greens cheese etc., and even though it was a simple Italian sandwich, it was a simply perfect Italian sandwich!  The on.y reason this wasn't a five star is the price is a smidge steep, and the portion size can und be a smidge bigger, but those are both just small smidgen....  For most people, the size might have been just right.  Service was great, and Enrico is always there, and he is always fun, even when crazy busy, this place is a classic that you must try when visiting the strip.  When you are done with ouch, grab a few biscotti on the way out from his bakery right next door.    I'll be back!",

    "text": "Holy cannoli!   Was on the way to gauchos for lunch and my friend insisted we had to get a cannoli before they sold out.  Not harboring much of a sweet tooth and the the thought of having dessert before lunch was soooooo unorthodox but soooooo glad we did because we snagged the last 3!   It was only 1pm on a Tuesday and they were out and I totally get why...so divine they blew my mind.   It was the perfect size and texture. The shell was just hard to bite into but soft enough the ricotta filled goodness didn't seep out everywhere.  I really liked how it wasn't overstuffed but not understuffed- it was literally the perfect trifecta of filling, sweetness, and crust- the holy cannoli.   Got to try the biscotti next time but until then, will plan another trip to the strip to satisfy my once dormant sweet tooth!  p.s. Will also have to try to make it to the bakers class one day early morning!",

They offer a couple classes as well including a bread making and pizza making class. The pizza making class was fun and interesting. It included dinner, pizza making in the wood fire oven and wine!   I highly recommend stopping in!",

There are a huge variety of biscottis in cool flavors like Apricot hazelnut, Chocolate orange almond, Black forest, Oatmeal raisin pecan... SO many to choose from!  Husband and I got two small 8 oz. bags which were $8/bag (if I remember correctly!) in Ginger almond and Vanilla dark chocolate flavors. I was worried that the biscottis would be too hard, but they were actually really soft and delicious.   Other baked goods that they had were cookies, cakes, pies, etc. There was a cookie called \"Person cookie\" which was half vanilla, half chocolate, which was really cute.  I would definitely recommend visitors to swing by here - biscottis make great souvenirs (even thought they may not last as long!).",

    "text": "What an awesome place! Tucked into a narrow alley way on Liberty Ave in the Strip you will find Enrico Biscotti. With all its charm and delicious food, I'd say it's a must-stop place for visitors and Pittsburgh-ers alike!  My husband and I took some relatives here on a Saturday AM around 1045. The place it's self is small, kind of cramped actually, but is so darn cute! If it were only the 2 of us, I'd consider giving it 5 stars, but when you're that cramped, it makes things a little hard to work with.  The food though! 5 stars! I ordered the breakfast pasta carbonara and my husband ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy. My pasta cooked well, the sauce was creamy and rich, and the bacon was thick enough to know it was there but cooked well. The biscuits and gravy are the best I've ever tried. Now, let's not all go crazy about the biscuits and gravy from the south, or your grandmothers or whoever, I'm fairly new to the biscuit/gravy game. The biscuit was fluffy and buttery and the gravy definitely hit you with sausage up front but creamy on the back. When you add the two over easy eggs on top.. voila! Delicious.  I've made it back for the pizza! We ordered the daily pizza which was mushroom and bacon. The crust was chewy, the cheese was creams, the bacon was thick and crunchy, and the mushrooms were precooked - maybe a little too watery for my liking, but I would order again.  We also ordered the fat salad - nothing special but was the perfect side dish to the pizza. Just standard green leaf lettuce, a balsamic house dressing, walnuts, and cranberries.  The pizza and salad was prefect for 2 people to share and still have some room for any other street snacks you might find in the strip. I will be back to try some more pizza!!",

I took The Easter bread making class starts out with Enrico show how the dough is made while waiting for the dough to rise everyone seats down at a long table and has dinner while Enrico tells the history od the Easter bread. The dinner is included with class it is a BYOB. Enrico does an amazing job with the story of the history of bread and with showing how to make the bread. The Biscotti store front is one the strip they have Biscotti, cakes pastries, pie, cookies, gluten free items, and Italian round bread loaves. The have red tins that they will ship there Biscotti`s for you. If you can`t make it to the Strip store The Market District Giant Eagles carry Enrico`s Biscotti. There Cafe is located behind the storefront tucked away there is a skinny walk way next to store where you will find the cafe they serve pasta salad pizza. I have also taken The Bread class and Pizza class both was just as much fun as the Easter class was. I highly recommend trying Enrico`s it is an amazing experience!!",

The space is very small, but you get a full view of the kitchen, which was pretty neat. Sadly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the pizza. I tried the margherita and it just didn't meet my expectations of a margherita, mainly because the sauce was so sweet. I don't mind a sweet sauce typically, but I guess I mind it when it's on a margherita. Another drawback to the Enrico Cafe was that there were sooo many fruit flies! I was surprised by this because I came here on a bitter cold day in January. You don't expect to see so many fruit flies in the dead of winter.   Although I didn't like the margherita, I'd be curious to try other pizza varieties or try something other than pizza from Enrico's.",

I was so thrilled to have found this place after sampling one of their biscottis at Yelp's recent airport event.  They were surprised to learn that a business out there sold their baked goods but delighted that it brought me in. While biscottis may be their mainstay they sell other pastries, pies, cakes, cookies, gluten free items, and even Italian bread round loaves.  Everything is made in house. Some biscottis come prebagged for travel but they are smaller and you don't get to choose.  You can also get bags of broken pieces for an assortment.  Full ones sell for $2.00 each but you can get 6 for $10.00. I was told not to refrigerate them. I didn't need to wrap them tightly when I got home. All I had to do was keep them in the bag and it would last for a long time.   I chose 4 different flavors to make up my 6 including cherry, lemon, macadamia nut white chocolate, and a pecan filled one. As I was finishing my order I heard the baker in the back say the macaroons had just been taken out of the oven so I immediately purchased the apricot one for $1.50. Literally it was so soft, warm, and had that fresh taste about it.  Some of the items they sell require refrigeration so I would recommend either stopping here last when visiting the Strip district or bringing a cooler. When I got home I broke into part of the cherry one. It was fresh, crunchy and broke off easily. I will be anxious to see how the others hold up as I consume them over the course of the week.  Conveniently located on Penn Ave near 20th St you are in the heart of the business district. Only problem has and always will be parking. Metered street parking is your best bet if you want to save some money.",

I could eat their pasta and pizza everyday, so I really recommend you give it a try if you're in the Strip.",

It is pretty quaint and unique inside.  First, let's talk about their wine... I had the red, it was not sweet, but not dry. Right in the middle and it was perfect! They kept it flowing, but made sure our waters were always filled and kept us hydrated. I appreciate that!  They had a nice little appetizer set up for everyone with fresh charcuterie, cheeses and fresh bread.  Next, salad. So I would like to tell you that I did tell them in advance that I do not participate in eating animal products. No problem! They were so nice in accommodating my needs. They asked us about food allergies and made sure everyone was getting what they wanted. They served a nice salad and gave me a bowl with one just for me with no cheese! How awesome! I attached a picture!  Now to dinner, they served roasted chicken with fig jam and I believe penne vodka. The girls said everything was amazing! It looked super yummy. For me, they gave me a plate of penne with a slight spicy red marinara, YUM! But, my favorite part was this steamed kale with onions, carrots, beans and this corn meal topping. I am so sorry and sad I did not take a picture, it was sooooo good I dug right in! It was seriously amazing, the woman who made it came over and told me how to make it, I cannot wait to give it a try!  Now to dessert and after dinner coffee selections.... They had some cookies, macaroons, cake pops and more! Everyone said they were super good and they had to go boxes for everyone too! I am OBSESSED with their americano, to say the least -- I had 3! Haha I love espresso and this might be the best espresso I have ever had.   Now to making the bread, first I want to tell you about the attire. We were all a little confused on how to dress. But, it is such a fun, casual atmosphere; don't feel the need to get super fancy. Heels are a no, but booties will be fine. Don't worry about getting dirty while making the bread, they have aprons! You can be super involved in the bread making or not at all! It's totally up to you. It was super fun and Max was so nice and patient while he talked all us girls through the making of the bread. Some girls never probably bake, some all the time. So it's truly a night out for all different types of girls, moms and so much more!   I cannot wait to come back again!!!",

The owner will acknowledge you immediately as you enter and will make you feel like a welcome guest in his home.  Our group of 4 had to wait 15 minutes, so the owner (Enrico, perhaps?) gave us a free bottle of table wine, which was light, dry and good.  The menu is short, but rest assured that everything is good.  Each person in our party of 4 got a different dish and shared it.  There wasn't a dish I wouldn't order again.  I got the stew which, surprisingly is not broth-based but includes fried potatoes with onions, sausage and spices.  It's dern hearty.  The lasagna was very cheesy and indulgently good.  The pasta fagioli comes in a large portion.  All dishes came with a side salad.",

The baker and owner was the one giving the class and he explained to us in minute detail the historical triumphs of bread and how it fits into everything as a cause-and-affect relationship. He was incredibly cheerful and informative.  At 50 dollars a person you get a HUGE breakfast. When I say huge I mean an entire long table full of pastries, cookies, muffins, homemade pastas, bean dishes, homemade sausage, freshly baked bread and many MANY more that I can't even remember. The beginning of the class is stuffing your face and passing the plates around like a big family as you are told about bread.  Making the bread was a lot of fun. The dough was already made and ready to go; all we did was kneed it (he showed us the correct way) and toss it into their awesome wood fired oven. The bread making class isn't at all about the actual making of the bread. It's more about familiarizing yourself with what bread is, learning good techniques and throwing away bad ones and separating the facts and myths of culinary. When you get home you have the knowledge and motivation to then go and make some of your own bread. It was a lot of fun and I would definitely do it again!",

I have very fond memories of going here with my family around the holidays. There's something so perfect about eating in this narrow, cozy kitchen hidden in an alley. It's always loud in a good way, and the service is usually great in a no-nonsense kinda way. The owners are usually milling about to check on you and make you feel at home. I'm all about the ambiance at this place -- it makes me feel like I'm back in Italy.  The food is also consistently great. Their sangaweeches -- sandwiches of Italian meats, cheeses, and greens wrapped in freshly baked pizza dough like an Italian taco --  are always delicious. They have wholesome soups in the winter and excellent giant salads full of nuts and berries and cheese.  Though I've never gotten the chance to drink it, I know they get rave reviews on their wine. I have, however, tried their baked goods sold in the store upfront. I've had some of the best cookies and macaroons of my life from this bakery. Anything with chocolate is a must.  I cannot recommend this place enough -- if you're in the strip district and you need a quick, hearty, AWESOME lunch, this is your place. Trust me.",

But, the homemade wine stinks! The petit syrah was ok. But, very young a coarse. The pinot grigio was awful! I am a winemaker and drink a lot of commercial wine from all over the world. I can truly say that it was awful. Then I find out it costs about $7.50 for a small glass. What a ripoff! As I write this review I found that you can bring your own. I wish I had known that. My friend asked if they had beer and the waiter said he could run across the street and get some. Why didn't they tell us about getting wine!  I really felt cheated! But, it won't happen again!!!",

They make everything fresh, including the dough for the pizzas, etc.  They have fantastic simple flatbread-style pizzas and sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes, all excellent, and a lot of vegetarian options.    This place has interesting strip district character and you MUST go there!  I think they're closed on Sundays.    After you have lunch there, go down a few doors and go to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for all your imported Italian food needs.",

To this day, when I am in town for a visit, I stop in.  Why? Because Enrico's makes the most perfect macaroon. It's heavy on coconut flakes, yet gooey. It's a macaroon miracle.  The other pastries I've sampled are equally wonderful. I guess it's time to venture down the side alley and check out the restaurant.  Kudos Enricos!",

Living nearby, I make a habit of dropping by Enrico's every once in while. The bread is hearty: rustic, massive loaves that could feed a family of eight or more. Biscotti are tasty. Plenty of other pastries available too, although they tend to be on the sweet/dessert-y side. Super, super friendly staff. Haven't tried the cafe.",

I decided to try them and I am in love!  They are different.   It's like they are overcooked on the outside (but not really), a little crunchy (I don't think that's the right way to describe them either) and they are moist and gooey on the inside!

While we waited we ordered a bottle of Chianti and the owner himself made us a pizza while we waited, on the house, to make the wait easier. A wait that was very worth it. The food is delicious- amazing salads and pizza and pasta ( al dente). Delicious bread. It was my mom's birthday and they treated her so nicely by giving her a few desserts on the house. She lived in Tuscany for 9 years as did I and we all agreed the food and ambiance are legitimate. The owner is very friendly. Overall a 5 star experience!!! Can't say enough good things about it.",

Upon entering you are overwhelmed by the sights and smells. Tons of glass jars layered row upon row with fresh baked biscotti. My favorites are the vanilla with milk chocolate and milk chocolate drizzle. Om nom nom. You can't go wrong with their monstrous macaroons. They are piled high with coconut and they even have some dipped in chocolate. EB has lots of fresh breads to choose from as well.   Every time I'm in the Strip, I make a point of hitting up EB for a little treat.",

    "text": "Making our way out of Primanti's the next stop on our list was another stop well thought of by locals - Enrico Biscotti Company.  Featuring house made, old school, all natural, hand cut Italian treats I rather expected to enter a large rustic space full off cakes, cookies, and confections - and to that end we most certainly weren't disappointed.  Greeted by a friendly young man as we watched two young ladies cut biscotti in the back I asked about a number of items that were not clearly marked and the three of us eventually settled on four separate options.  Paying with credit (I was actually amazed how many spots in the Burgh were cash only) we made our way to the car and drove to the National Aviary where we'd enjoy the desserts while waiting for the exhibits to open.  Having heard great things about the Chocolate Ravioli I'd ordered one - or at least I thought I did.  Taking a bite we'd clearly received the wrong order as the filling of the crisp and buttery shell yielded candied lemon peel.  Tasty, sweet, but definitely not what I'd expected.  Moving on to the next taste, a dish described as \"Strawberry Soft Biscotti\" we were yet again duped, but this time in a good way.  Sweet and cakelike this \"biscotti\" was most certainly not Strawberry but instead a sweet and complex amalgam of maraschino cherry and pistachio.  The best of our four options and also the most filling of the group I was quite happy with the biscotti while my mother and sister remained underwhelmed.  Moving on to our second pair of selections, the drier of the options, we started with the \"Banana Walnut Biscotti.\"  Tasting minimally like banana, less like walnut, and mostly like a good sugar cookie all I can say is that it was nicely textured plain biscotti - I'm not sure if this was another mistake in our order or simply a lack of pronounced flavors.  Following the biscotti was a \"Blackberry drop\" Scone - a sugary biscuit with lush pockets of butter and thick whole blackberries - it was excellent.  Throughout the rest of our visit to Pittsburgh we would see Enrico Biscotti at multiple markets, bakeries, and shops - clearly they are not hurting for fame or business, even if they are hurting for competent help at home base.  While none of the items we had were bad, only the scone was more impressive than an average quality version of the same thing at any good bakery - perhaps we just went on a bad day or perhaps we ordered wrong...then again, perhaps we ordered right and just got the wrong thing?",

Hazelnut, chocolate vanilla, orange nutmeg almond, lemon... you name it, they've probably made it.   The one flavor I REALLY wanted though, was the peanut butter bacon biscotti.

I tasted more textures than flavors but then again I have a haitian girlfriend so I am used to her food being flavor explosions in my mouth. We left more than half our food on the table. The ladies next to us got the fig pizza and said it was delicious and it's all they ever get. I will have to give that a try if I ever return for the cafe because it did look delicious. On the other hand, the biscottis are to die for! The gentleman helping with the biscottis was beyond generous and helpful.

During my first excursion to The Strip, I walked by a few times before I realized where the mouthwatering baked-good smell was coming from.   When I walked inside I was surrounded - literally - by biscotti. There were jars and jars & trays and trays of them, at first I didn't even notice the person hidden behind them willing & waiting to help me.   I got a hodge-podge of flavors. Pistachio-Cranberry, Chocolate-Almond, Peanut-Butter-Chocolate-Chip, & others I can't even remember (1.50ea). There are some fancy-shmancy ones that are drizzled in white or milk chocolate (1.75).   Proceeded to scoff approximately 4 of them in 2 days, then return to bring some back to my office as a treat.   They didn't make it in quite the condition I got them in, as I was forced to plane-side check my bag, thanks for that US Airways & jacka**es who put their coats in overhead bins leaving no room for other people's precious biscotti. HOWEVER, despite the less than perfect appearance, my co-workers loved them.   4.5 stars if I could! Will try the cafe next time I'm there!",

I usually go there Saturdays for brunch and so far I've been happy: the menu is well balanced, the pizza and bread are fresh and the coffee is a-ok!  The ambiance in the cafe is very very nice. You walk a tiny alley, sneak through a door and enter a fairly narrow room with an open kitchen. The best thing is that this is one of the few places where the kitchen is larger than the seating areas. You will get your hot beverages in mismatched cups which adds to the charm and often enough you'll talk to people that are nice to talk to. Last time we were there we got strong recommendations for the lunch goulash and after being prompted to try it with compliments from the chef I have to say that I need to go back.   I did try their biscotti plenty of times and I must say I'm not impressed but then again I'm not a connoisseur.",

They have about 20 different styles of biscotti and I've never been disappointed with any of them.  They are not as hard as the biscotti I've had at other bakeries but they are way better than any biscotti I've ever had.   While I'm not a huge macaroon fan (not big on coconut) their macaroons are the best looking macaroons I've ever seen and according to everyone I've ever been with that has had them, they are delicious and they usually claim they are the best they've ever had.
