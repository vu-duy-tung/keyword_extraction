    "text": "This is one of the bars that makes the Carson Street experience enjoyable.  Although less so than The Library, Smokin' Joe's is one of those places that has multiple personalities depending on the time of day.  On weekdays and up until around 10pm on weekends, the place has regulars, you can use the pool table or play darts without too much trouble, and it's a great place to catch a Pens game.  Late night on weekends, the downstairs gets packed with one too many girls sipping on Washington Apple shots for my taste...But it's certainly still fun.  Unfortunately, unless there's a game on, the upstairs is always, well, boring, and the excellent beer selection does not extend to up there.  I wish they could do something to make better use of the upstairs space.  Don't expect the bartenders to know how to make any sort of specialty cocktail unless there's beer involved.  I'm obsessed with the Haystack: half Hoegaarden, half Framboise.  One thing that's a little backwards about Smokin' Joe's is the abundance of Miller Lite specials.  You are a beer bar with a huge selection on tap and hundreds of bottled beers:  Why all the specials on crappy beer?",

Be sure to check out their new food menu too (new in July)...the lobster queso dip is amazing.

We loved that we had 15 wings, cheese sticks, 4 vodka drinks & 4 draft beer for $36. The bartender was attentive and willing to make sure we liked the beers before ordering. She asked questions and gave several samples before we could decide on the perfect one. We sat at the bar and enjoyed every minute!",

Like any bar in South Side, when it's crowded, the experience can be pretty miserable.  It's a high end beer joint infiltrated by douches who don't care what they're drinking.  I wish those guys would just drive down to Jack's and drink some swill.  If the downstairs is crowded, it might be worth it to go upstairs.  Bartender is equally as friendly and it's a smaller space, which can be good or bad.  I do repeat, why do people go to this bar just to drink a Bud.  It's like going to the Four Seasons and ordering a fucking hot dog.",

    "text": "Smokin' Joes, like many bars on Carson Street, differs depending on when you decide to go.  It's either loud, crowded and has top  40 music pumping, is packed with Penguins/Steelers fans during a game, or is relatively low key with patrons hanging out over sports and casual conversation.  I've decided to go during these different times and one thing is always a constant: the beer.  With an extreme bottle selection and an impressive draft selection, Smokin' Joes is the place to go on Carson Street for the beer lover (besides Carson Street Deli).  If it isn't too busy you are able to 'try before you buy' with their draft selection which is always nice when you want to try something new.  Due to the awkward setup of this bar, it gets quite jammed up on weekend nights when you first walk in but you can usually find some standing room in the back near the pool table and darts.  As for the food, typical pub grub fleshes out the menu.  The food won't blow your mind but will leave you content when hungry.  I've had the ribs with a side of fries and it was satisfying.  All in all, I enjoy Smokin' Joes during the more mellow parts of the day (before 9 pm on the weekends) but I find myself coming back quite often due to my affinity for delicious beer.",

It's not a five star restaurant, but the wings are tasty. Especially on Thursdays when it's 40 wings and a pitcher of miller light for $20. That's a deal you just can't beat, I wish the beer was a better choice, but it goes well with the wings. Pool table is cheap, only $0.50 per game. They play the Pittsburgh sports games on the tv and turn it on the overhead speakers, so if you're looking for a good place to drink some beer and watch some sports, Joe's is your place.",

I tried their wings and they were average at best with nothing unique - No signature flavor, No homemade dressing, Fat Heads down the street has unique flavor that shows someone took the time to separate the menu and taste buds from everyone else. The establishment is a BAR so food shouldn't be the staple but on the Southside which every other building is a bar you have to standout.",

    "text": "I have been to Smokin' Joe's on a few occasions and have mixed feelings.   The wings are some of my favorite around (probably why I keep coming back), they have a variety of flavors, quality wings with plenty of meat on them, and they are very reasonably priced.  In addition to the wings their Taco Tuesday special is a wonderful value with quality taco's compared to what you get at other restaurants during this special.   While the food is the bright spot of Smokin' Joe's the service and atmosphere certainly is not.  In the four times I have been there, I have never seen more than one server on the floor and one person staffing the bar and it shows in the service the customer receives.  It can be very difficult to get a drink refill once you have already received your food unless you are seated at the bar. In addition the servers are not very friendly, I attribute this to being understaffed, they always seem rushed and stressed. The bar at the front of the restaurant makes sitting at the bar a poor option.   Overall, I would return to Smokin' Joe's for the wings or with friends on Taco Tuesday but it would not be my first choice.   (Side note: if you spend $50+ dollars your receive a $5 gift certificate for your next visit...which is nice)",

The food is decent, we tried a few more items than just the wings. Portions are huge and reasonably priced, and you get options like salads as well as typical bar food. They have several TV's around the bar which usually show different games. What I like the best is their huge bottle selection! I'm originally from Europe, and I truly find myself missing some of the go-to beers I used to have back there. I have been looking for some of them at so many bars here in Pittsburgh, but only found them at Smokin' Joe's. Their beer prices are also really reasonable. However, it's obvious when the staff want to go home, or rather watch one of the games, or do anything but serve you. Their draft list is also quite outdated and they don't have everything that's on it. A bar I'll stop by more, but I honestly don't see myself becoming a regular.",

You bet!)...and where everybody knows your name. This is the kind of place where the older South Side locals go 3-4 nights a week and have been for years. Pop in on any random night and most likely they'll be sitting at the bar. (Ask for Finn and tell him Kim sent you!)  It's also a home to young professionals and the college crowd, and overall the vibe is very chill and casual.   The staff are super friendly and always willing to suggest a brew if you're overwhelmed about the hundreds, yes hundreds, of drafts available. They have many hard-to-find selections and will give you a taste if you ask, definitely a beer-lovers dream.  Great wing selection as well and you can't beat the 35 cent wing specials during the week. Try the seasoned salt, the perfect complement to a nice cold beer. The pizza may take a little while to make but it's worth the wait. There's also a $2.50 vodka anything special on Saturdays. And if it gets a little too crowded for your liking on the weekend, just head upstairs to a secret bar where there's plenty of seating.  Definitely a must go if you've never been there and are looking for a great neighborhood bar!",

    "text": "I'm new to Yelp, but this is one place I will review.  East Carson Street is over-flowing with bars and restaurants. However, there is one place many seem to miss, and it's quite the hidden gem. If you like great beer, great bar food, friendly/cute/knowledgable cocktail waitress, and bartenders who know their drinks, Smoking Joe's is the place for you.  Commonly mistaken for a dive-bar, \"The Joe\" is a staple of the South Side for beer-lovers. I've been going there since I was underage, but this is one of the few places I will go back to. Has a very neighborhood/town-bar feel to it. The beer selection is incredible; they always have 65 beers on tap from all-around the world, including seasonal selections abound for those with adventurous taste-buds, in addition to over 300 or more on bottle.  The food is above-average and inexpensive. Their wings are the best in the Southside, and maybe the city. Tuesday and Wednesday nights are designated \"Wing Nights\", 30 cents each from 7 to 12, and Thursday night is \"Yuengs and Wings Night\", 40 wings and a pitcher of Yuengling for 12.95. Aside from the wings, the Burgers are good, and one of the better Steak Salads I've had. Everything is under 12 bucks.  The service is exceptional. Tommy and Llama run the bar, and they know their stuff. Just don't ask Tommy how he feels about Big Ben or the Steelers. The cocktail waitresses are cute, funny, attentive, and know their beers.   In terms of entertainment, there are plenty of HD-TV's around always playing whatever sporting events are taking place, and they will always allow you to change the channel to watch a different game if need be. They don't run a tight ship here, fairly laid-back. There is a Golden Tee machine, as well as a dart board, and a touch-screen Jukebox.  The crowd: Literally an eclectic mix of young professionals, thirty-somethings, folks from the neighborhood, and can become \"College-y\" on weekends. A self-proclaimed \"Penguins\" bar, this place always seems to fill up on game-nights. Like others said, weekends are hectic, but here's a secret; they have an upstairs called \"The Distillery\".  The Distillery is just a name for the upstairs bar. A smaller room littered with beer-paraphenilla, the upstairs has a smaller tap selection and a smaller bottled selection, but if not busy, the bartenders will go downstairs and get the beer of your choice. The bonus of the upstairs is the drop-down projection screen, great for hockey games or football games. This upstairs is only open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.  There are specials every night of the week, but you don't need an excuse to come by the Joe, get some wings, and have a beer you've never tried before. Just tell the boys what kinda beer you like, and they will point you in the right direction. Tell them John sent you in.",

    "text": "Stuffed from a burger and sundae, I eventually ended up a few blocks down the street at Smokin' Joes to close out the afternoon. Of course I didn't eat anything, but just grabbed a drink. I was initially excited about the excellent variety of beer selections and I may have stayed for more than one pint except for one thing: the three douche bags sitting next to me at the bar.  Obviously, all single, late 30-something know-it-alls who felt it necessary to talk about international politics, recessive genetics and other completely random stuff, all ultra boring for a bar on a Saturday afternoon. It wouldn't have been nearly as bad had they not been the type of idiots who unintentionally talked loudly to one another, even though they were all sitting close together and there were few other patrons in the place. Apparently, we all had to hear the 'intellectuals' impart their wisdom on and about the world.   After a short time, I downed my beer, got an acknowledged eye-roll out of the guy sitting on my other side and got the heck out of there feeling very annoyed. I realize Joe's has no control over which idiots walk through their door, so I'll probably give them another chance someday.",

Im sorry but I work in a restaurant. When we have guests that are still drinking or eating, we wait patiently for them to finish. We don't kick them out just because we want to go home. The servers were rude. The one was walking around with her hood up the entire time looking unprofessional. We go there a lot so we were very disappointed with this past visit. The owner has always been friendly as well as the bartender that night who helped suggest drinks for us.  I would consider getting a new serving staff because I know I wouldn't want them in my restaurant being rude to customers like they were that night.",

To make things even better, the waitresses are really attentive, and if you are indecisive about what beer to get, they're fairly knowledgeable and will let you try several beers before you make a decision.  The food is about the usual for bar food, however they do have specials for each day of the week (25 cent boneless chicken wings on Mondays, 75 cent sliders on Thursdays, etc).   The Friday and Saturday crowd seems to be a mix of undergraduates and graduate students.  Overall, it's a fairly chill and fun atmosphere.  Smokin Joe's is probably the best place for beer in town.",

I like going here for several reasons:  First, they have an extensive and relatively cheap beer list.  60 on tap and over 300 in bottles.   Second, They are open 11 am - 2 am every day of the week.  Since my \"weekend\" is Monday-Tuesday, I appreciate somewhere I can go to unwind on a Sunday night.   Third, they have some of the best wings in the city.  if you go on a Wednesday, they are 40 cents each (25 for boneless).   Lastly, it's the perfect South Side \"Goldilocks\" bar.  It's not expensive and pretentious, but it's not so shady that you think you will get knifed if you insist on ordering something classier than Miller Light.   A few weaknesses to note. The bartenders are amazing, but some of their servers are painfully slow.  Also, the food menu is really hit or miss.  The wings, spinach dip, and french onion soup are all fantastic.  Their burgers and sandwiches are somewhat lacking.    Overall, however, Smokin' Jones is one of my favorite bars in the South Side.",

While at Smokin Joes, the two others that I was with ordered a pitcher at about 1:15, and we were asked to leave at 1:30. When they asked to finish their pitcher, the server said \"you are finished\" and took it away / poured the roughly $20 pitcher down the drain. When I asked for the server's name, I planned to call the next day and complain and made that clear, he refused, began yelling, and grabbed me while escorting me out. This is the worst service that I have ever had, and I would avoid this place like the plague if it is past 12:30 am.",

They should really just keep a chalkboard of the drafts on tap and erase them when no longer available instead of having the staff come back to the table like 8 times to tell us they were out.  She also screwed up our bills.  Burger was good at the moment, but a few hours later I felt like ass.  And, no, it wasn't because I was drinking- I didn't even get to have more than one.  Which, by the way, was a skunky Bell's Oberon.  I'm always curious when going to places with an extensive draft list how long the keg has actually been tapped....  I'll probably give it another try sometime.",

There were 6 of us grad students who went out, 2 beers each and enough food to warrant calling it a meal, and somehow with tax and tip it was $60. For SIX people.  What up, Pittsburgh.    The food was pretty good for bar food--bruschetta was a bit odd (maybe it was the bacon) but the mac & cheese bites, prov sticks, and hot peppers were great, and fries, zucchini planks, and potato skins were all quite good too.  The bar area is pretty long but they have tables with servers as well, and various games (pool, darts) around for your entertainment.

    "text": "With the least amount of pretension allowed by craft beer bar law, this place ranks high on my list of great beer bar destinations.  With over 60 drafts, and 350 bottles their selection covers some impressive ground.  The back bar couldn't be any simpler. Its a full length row of glass door coolers, exactly what you would expect to see along the back wall at a 7-Eleven convenience store.  (a wild fantasy 7-Eleven, but a 7-Eleven nonetheless).  These coolers are propped up a bit higher and leave the people sitting at the bar a good view of the beers offered.    The service was great - from both of the bartenders working the bar.  It was a very busy afternoon when I was there, and they made it look easy.  Great mix of very friendly locals and tourists.  To say that I have had a few beers in my life would be a tiny bit of an understatement.  I love to try new beers, or at least beers I have never had.  At Smokin' Joe's I had Moylan's Nitro Special Bitter, Anchor Brewing's Humming Ale,  Ballast Point Brewing's Reef Rye Brown Ale, and Elysian Brewing Company's The Immortal IPA.  I was impressed with all 4 of them, and oddly enough, most impressed with the Humming Ale.  Awesome selection.  Looking for a bit of a snack to go along with the beers, I ordered the pierogies and added the kielbasa option.  I saw them served to someone else across the bar and had to get them.  Unfortunately they were hard to find on the menu.  For some reason they are way in the back, almost listed as an afterthough.  They shouldn't be.  They were prepared just as I had hoped.  Topped with a bunch of quick high heat pan fried in butter white onions, leaving some teeth to them, but also giving some of that sweet caramelized flavor.    There is a large flatscreen TV on the wall that separates the front and back of the room.  The screen changes showing you their list out the most recent tapped beers, the list of IPA's only, and a few others.  Great idea.  I'll be back.",

They have a large selection of beer and I felt the staff helped us choose a beer we would like. I saw a few food items pass us, and they looked simple but fresh.    I was told that this place  can get busy, which I believe because they had a lot of staff working.  I mean initially the staff to guest ratio was 3:1. By the time we left the bar was full. Not packed but busy.  I look forward to going back here!",

If the packed crowds of South Side aren't your fancy, Joe's has solid food with a great beer and liquor selection. The service is fast, and excellent. A pool table, dart boards, and dozens of TVs as well make it a great hangout spot for anyone looking to start, or end their night away from the crowds in the South Side.",

So I've had a chance to visit a tremendous number of great beer joints!  My Holy Grail is the big three- A great beer selection, amazing gastro-pub food, and a bartender that looks like a Victoria's Secret model!  I haven't found this mystical place yet but I'll keep trying.  Smokin' Joe's is one for three but it's the most important one and that's a great beer selection.  What can I say; the tap list and the bottle list are both exceptional. The organization of the beer list itself is very good.  Many less traveled folks would probably say five stars but I'm going for 4.  The lists at the 5 star places include IBUs and a more extensive description of each beer.  BTW, the beer prices are very competitive here.    As others have said, the food is hit and miss here.  For me it was a miss.  Actually I'm not even going to discuss it. I'm going to think of these folks as a four star beer place without a menu.  If you are a beer aficionado and in the Pittsburgh area, a visit here is a must.  Just eat first and come here for the brews.",

It was crowded when we got there so we expected to wait for service, but by the time we left there were only a few tables occupied. It is clear that we were intentionally denied service as the waitress avoided eye contact at all costs. The food menu looked great and reasonably priced but I'll never go back.",

There are also televisions everywhere, so there is no shortage of activities.  Moreover, Smokin' Joe's has an impressive beer selection. I was unable to count (or even find) all of the taps demonstrating how large the selection is. Additionally, there was a huge refrigerator with bottled beers behind the bar redoubling the beer count. Simply, impressive.",

I never had a problem before, until last night. They usually have some sort of special every day on their large beer selection, which is awesome.  I checked barsmart and they were supposed to have $2.00 domestic drafts from 7pm -12 on Friday. I know that website is not always up to date so I checked the bar's website which said that they would have $2.50 domestic bottles--no problem, still a deal.  When we arrived their was a chalkboard sign advertising $2.75 Labatt drafts for the Pens game and on the menu and on another chalkboard sign advertising 1.00 off Sam Adams pints from 7-12.  The waitress informed us that not only did they not have the Labatts because they were out, that they had no other specials. I asked about the website specials and she replied, \"I don't know who does our website.\" I asked about the Sam Adams special and she said \"that was only until 7\"  We tried to show her the 6 ft chalkboard sign that was 3 ft away and the menu and her response was \"I guess I can give it to you since you said you saw it\"---as if we made it up! She was extra surly and barely accommodating.   There were 3 of us and we ordered food, so our bill was over $60.  I don't mind paying full price, I just didn't like the bait and switch and the attitude.",

The beer-Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout-was well worth the trip and the $13 a glass price.  The nachos were huge and the blackened chicken have them a nice flavor. I wasn't a fan of their salsa, but I would order them again. The server suggested some bacon on too of the Mac n Cheese. It was a huge plate of cheesy goodness. I barely ate a third of it. The bacon was a great addition but a couple of the pieces were really hard. I chewed each bit carefully but there were only two really hard pieces that were tiny. The rest of the bacon was fine.  They have four more beers on tap that I would like to come back to try as well as their Lobster Queso (which they are also known for).  This is definitely a bar with high top tables and bar stools, but the service is great.",

They were generally pretty good about keeping track of who ordered what but did not manange to bring out my friends food in time with everyone elses. He had to ask two times where his order was while everyone else was eating and it finally came out around an hour later. While I understand the stress of serving a big group, I feel like the restaurant should have been better equipped with handling big crowds.   The food itself was hit or miss. The wings, provolone sticks, and tacos are very tasty. The burgersm on the other hand, are a bit dry and tasteless. They also have a very extensive selection of brews that I have to come back to try.   Overall, I would come here for the happy hour tacos and wings but wouldnt recommend for a venue for big crowds.",

The food menu is cool and unique. Some things that caught my eye were kielbasa and bacon skewers, powdered pretzel bites (deep fried soft pretzels with powdered sugar), brisket & beer cheese nachos ect. They also have favorites such as a Rachel, Reuben, flatbreads, cheesesteaks and a great mix of burgers.  Our go-to here is the lobster queso dip which is served with tortilla chips. It is delicious and it isn't lacking on the lobster. It tastes fresh (fresher than you'd think it'd be at a bar). You can also order the lobster queso on fries. I have also had their perogies (delish) and a burger with fries.  (bbq bacon burger)  Their draft list is huge. There is a bar, seating area and pool table. Its a cool bar with great food.

We stopped in here after dinner, so while they have food and it looked pretty good, we just had drinks.  We were there on trivia night and the rear table area of the bar was packed, but we easily found a couple of seats at the bar.  The bartenders were nice and attentive.  I grabbed one of the beers from the tap list to start.  It was ok, but while drinking that one I was able to really give the cooler a look and found something I wanted.  The price was also very good.  A few beers each and we didn't pay all that much.  Definitely a place I'd love to return to next time I'm in town.",

The bar is quite long with ample seating.  Never had a problem with outdated bottles or beer that did not taste quite right on tap.  The bartenders and waitresses, they are really nice and quite knowledgable about beer, the problem is, there are not enough of them, especially when it is late at night or during a Pens/Steelers game. So the service is good, just not enough of it...  There are a ton of bottled beers (200+) and beers on tap (at least 40) here. There is no shortage of varying style of beer. They do quite well keeping up with the seasonals as well.  Average bar food...nothing going to blow you out of the water here.   A great bar for beer quality and quantity. A must stop when on the Southside, beware of the crowds at night and during sporting events.",

The mac and cheese is a great pick from the menu if you are in the market for some munch. Another lesser known but interesting and useful thing to know about Smokin' Joe's is the room upstairs available to rent for functions. There's a bar and plenty of seating, a great find for a birthday party or other special occasion. The beer selection on tap is great, but they have an even bigger cooler with cans and bottles with a wide variety of choices.  Check this place out, it's a winner!",

If you're a craft beer fan without an ounce of pretentiousness, this unassuming joint is an absolute beer oasis. I'm talking HUNDREDS of beers. On. Tap.  Yessssss.  When we lived on the \"sathsihde\", we made it a habit to saunter up and down E. Carson Street to people watch, bar hop, or grab a bite. To this day, E. Carson is the best street I've ever lived on and I miss it immensely. We frequented Smokin' Joe's than I'd like to admit.  The food at Smoking' Joe's was pretty straight forward - sandwiches, wings, fries, so unless they've changed their menu around,  I wasn't ever truly wow'd. But, that's not what makes SJ's such a lovable spot. Its the beer, beer selection and the staff.  There's also games in the back of the house, but admittedly, the only time I wandered back there was to visit the grungy ladies room. I spent the majority of the time trying to scout a seat at the bar, watching the Pens on the multitude of TVs.",

    "text": "Smokin' Joe's is possibly my favorite bar in the South Side.  If only it wasn't the favorite of so many others, too, I'd probably stop over more frequently than I do.  It's a great neighborhood bar with an impressive beer selection (both on tap and in bottles).  With over 50 taps, they do offer beer flights and growlers.  Most times when I think I'll just stop in for a beer I will also end up ordering food because it just smells so good.  Be sure to check daily food and drink specials.  I used to work in the South Side and would often hit up Smokin' Joe's for their lunch specials.  It's mostly your average bar food but I was never disappointed.  It's a chill place for a quick bite or a long night of drinking.  If you're looking for velvet ropes, don't go here.  Smokin' Joe's has been around for awhile, it's not one of those pretentious places that will be gone in two months.    When I lived in the South Side, the charismatic bartenders at Smokin' Joe's kept me coming back.  The vast beer selection and tasty food didn't hurt, either.  In fact, I think I'm about due to stop back in.",

    "text": "As a former Southside resident, Smoking Joe's has been a regular establishment for most occasions, in any and all weather and for any type of crowd. Despite my first check-in here, this is obviously not my first visit to the place, so this review will be a mashup of many trips. The last check in was this past Saturday a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Valentine's Day Barcrawl.  I found my group towards the back of the bar by the pool table and within was greeted and attended to within 5 minutes of arrival. Joe's has a large list of rotating draft and craft beers so I naturally asked for the current specials and the stout selection. [It's currently chocolate stout season - which is my favorite] I was delighted to find that Joe's served Southern Tier's Chokolat [10% ABV American Imperial/Double Stout]. On average, Joe's has around 100 different types of Beer in house so you are sure to find just what you are hankering for.   Being hungry, the waitress fetched me a menu, again, well between within the appropriate 5 minute window. The selection is standard American Pub food, ranging from Wings, loaded fries to sandwiches and wraps. Each day of the week during the 5-7pm happy hour there is a different food special so be sure to check back different days of the week. My personal favorite, however, are the Ribs. Joe's will always have my heart on the Ribs as they were the only location who was willing to serve me at 1am on a Saturday during Snowmageddon February 2010. The full slab is served with a full basket of fries and a large side of coleslaw.  If you not one to ogle over the Beer selection or gossip with the Barkeep, you can easily entertain yourself with the ever popular Pool table or Darts. The lighting is dimmed for the typical South Side atmosphere and the prices are average for the city and on the lower end for Carson street. The waitstaff is efficient and friendly and the entirety of the experience is satisfyingly homestyle.   Bravo and keep it up.",

The staff is really awesome and friendly and has been happy to help me decide what beer to try each time I have gone. There are so many beers and can be a little overwhelming when you first walk in, so don't hesitate to ask their opinion!   I have yet to eat anything here besides the fried pickles. They are pickle chips and are honestly not my favorite, but they aren't bad. You get a lot of them and if you come during happy hour they're half off!   Smokin joes is overall an awesome place to kick back, watch a game or go to happy hour and drink some awesome beers! It gets packed on the weekends, so get there early on a Friday or Saturday!",
