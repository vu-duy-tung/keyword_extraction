Ordered braised beef and shredded pork over rice dishes.  Both were very salty and not the typical braised beef you usually get from any Chinatown. Since we could not continue eating, we ordered the Singapore noodles and still a tad salty but a spritz of lime/lemon usually cuts down the saltiness. The manager was apologetic since the cooks at that time were not their regular cooks. She was considerate not to charge us both rice dishes.",

    "text": "There were a few things that caught my eye about this place - the name, the bright orange exterior and the futuristic interior all pulled me in. I love asian food and was eager to try another noodle joint out! However, I can't say that this is my favorite noodle joint in Pittsburgh and this is why.   While many items on the menu caught my eye (i.e. duck/pork belly sliders, pineapple fried rice and the thai basil chicken), I had to get the thai style flat noodle with shrimp. It's a noodle place and it only made sense to try something that resides in the name of the restaurant, right? Thai dishes are typically spicy on their own, but you can add some extra kick with their spice level of 1-5. I wanted to give mine a spice level of 2, but our waitress said she would just bring out extra sauce if it wasn't spicy enough for me. When my dish came out, I was very satisfied with the amount of noodles and the size of the shrimp, but once I took my first bite I became let down. The noodles were very doughy/overcooked and the dish was not spicy. Our waitress brought out a mixture of chili paste/sriracha to turn up the heat and it did help! I also ordered a mango smoothie bubble tea and this was probably the best bubble tea I have had in Pittsburgh.   Although the noodles left me disappointed, I will still be back to try the pork belly/duck sliders and pineapple fried rice!",

I was really looked forward to the pineapple. That was pretty disappointing. At least the rice was tasty so I wasn't too upset. Delivery was quick and professional. which was great. Took about 30 minutes and the food was hot. Hopefully if you order this rice you'll get some pineapple in yours!",

Unfortunately, though the staff is nice their food is not so nice. I ordered a beef pho (they have tripe, meatball, and a combo option), spring rolls, and Thai tea with boba.  Got the Thai tea, and I immediately disliked it. Poor flavor and bad boba. It would seem as if the people are not trained to make it properly. The waitress made it, and she gave it to me and explained that she just kind of figures it out. She did not cook the tapioca balls enough so they were hard and clumped together. The spring rolls were not spring rolls. They were egg rolls but with a friend rice paper wrapper instead of the usual wrapper. They were the best part of the meal even if they were not what I wanted. The pho was quite awful. I always finish my food, but I lost my appetite halfway through. It had no flavor at all. The chef must have been scared of salt. I added hoisin and Sriracha in hopes I'd get more flavor. It didn't work. When I told the waitress she said perhaps it was because I'd asked for no jalapeno. Not the reason, and the 2 jalapeno slices in my friends soup wouldn't have done anything either. She brought out salt and some Thai peanut sauce for me to put in my soup. Not only is it ridiculous that I had to try to season my soup myself (without success), but she also seemed to think that it would do the trick. Very disappointed.",

Mr. J ordered a black milk tea and it tasted like it was made from a mix. I had the mango and there wasn't a drop of tea in it. It was just a sugary mango juice with tapioca pearls.  When our meals came out, there were a few other glaring issues: - sweet dumpling sauce served with the soup dumplings. These are traditionally served with black vinegar and shredded ginger, by the way. - the eggs in the ramen were overcooked and the yolks were a powdery gloop. - the ramen noodles were overcooked and mushy. - the beef tendon was undercooked and rubbery. This place is terribly overpriced for the quality of food. Go next door to The Comubian Place for a good meal.",

I ordered the Crab Rangoon, Pork Soup Dumplings, Thai Flat Noodles, and a sprite. They forgot the soup dumplings completely, and due to the trainwreck known as UberEATS,  I never got them. The sprite was soda water, I guess the box was out and no one knew. The Thai noodles were flavorless, over cooked, and greasy- so gross. The crab Rangoon was good. Will not be ordering again.",

I ended up going with the dumplings and singapore noodles since I never had them before. The dumplings were absolutely amazing but sadly the noodle dish was not. This particular dish comes with all of the meats in it and the meat seemed a bit questionable in my opinion. The beef was extremely chewy and the chicken didn't look right. One thing that I was very impressed with was their bubble tea menu. Most places don't have quite that many options and flavors. I would probably go back just to get their bubble teas to go.",

Service was quick, server was friendly and helpful, and portions were generous.   You can adjust the heat/spiciness on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the mildest and 5 the hottest. Usually restaurants err on the side of caution with the heat ratings, but our \"3\" entrees carried quite a kick, and even the \"2\" entrees had more heat than we expected. We could handle the heat, but that's definitely something to keep in mind while ordering.   We were all very pleased with Mad Noodles and look forward to eating there again soon.",

They'll treat you like garbage and talk crap to other patrons while you're sitting right there.  Went in Sunday night with my boyfriend. I am getting over a cold and wanted soup, and we also looked at houses all day and wanted to talk about one we were considering buying. When we walked in, the bartender/waitress/only person in the front of house said we could sit anywhere, then my boyfriend saw some menus on a table and tried to take one. She told us that there were already menus at every table. It was our bad, so we just picked a table. She brought us some water, then didn't come back for another 5-7 minutes (I wasn't timing her, we were talking, but it did get to the point where I was looking around to see where she had gone).  She came back and took our drink order, and kept correcting us on little things we misspoke on, including my boyfriend saying, \"Soup dumplings,\" then her saying, \"pork?\" and him saying yes to pork, then her saying, \"Not pork and crab,\" then me being like, no pork, then her being like, \"It's good to specify that.\" We misspoke, and she corrected us in an overly bossy tone. I'm using bossy to be nice, but it made me feel sassy, so I ordered in a bossy tone to match.  We sat back and kept talking about houses. During the time that we sat there, she came back to ask us if we had ordered an appetizer and say that, \"Your drinks are almost done,\" in the next fifteen minutes. She walked past our table while we were looking at the seller's disclosure for a house and underhandedly said, \"We're real interactive tonight,\" to no one. Then, as the other table was leaving she said, \"Thank you so much, some people can be so rude, especially tonight.\"   At that point we were both pissed, hungry, and certain that she was talking about us, which is not professional or ok. When she came back a SECOND time 20 minutes later to ask us what we had ordered, my boyfriend lost it and told her we were leaving. She asked why, and he exploded (it was horrible but I don't regret it, she was terrible at her job). She walked us out, nodding and disagreeing with us on every point we brought up. Personally I think if she wants to play the cold jerk waitress card she should go back to bartending at some seedy southside bar.   The other people probably felt bad for her and gave her a nice tip it was so explosive. Apparently we walked in with an attitude, but all we walked in to do was eat soup and talk about a house.",

    "text": "I ordered from Mad Noodles last night via Uber Eats. I only mention Uber Eats because I am going to attribute the temperature of my food on arrival to Uber Eats, despite the fact that the driver appeared to take an efficient route to my apartment.  I was actually craving Pho Van, but they are not available on Uber Eats and I have found Postmates to be worse in service, and far more expensive. So I searched for pho in Uber Eats and Mad Noodles popped up. I quick Yelp peak indicated middling reviews, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  Looking at their menu I allowed the self-deception to take hold and got excited. Pho and soup dumplings on one menu? Having that.  I should have known better. These trendy pan-asian \"noodle\" places don't tend to be good at anything in particular. I believe I have even reviewed Lulu's Noodles in the past which should have served as my reminder to avoid this type of place in the future.  My food arrived, and as hinted above, the temperature was not where I hoped it would be. The broth was warm, but not hot, and the soup dumplings were room temperature.  I dug into a soup dumpling first. I was rewarded with a large, boring pork meatball and a small amount of soup that was already re-congealing. The taste was almost more sweet than savory, which still doesn't make sense to me at all.  Next, I started to prepare my pho. The pho arrives with the broth in one large plastic container, and the noodles and beef in another. The garnishes arrive in a small styrofoam container, and included a generous heap of bean sprouts, a few stems of cilantro, sliced jalapeno pepper, a lime wedge and a single basil leaf. I can't recall if white onions were included, or just present in the broth (which also contained jalapeno pepper slices). Neither Sriracha nor Hoisin was provided, but fortunately I keep those at home.  The first disappointment came in terms of the beef. I am accustomed to Pho Van's pho tai, which is recognizable as thin slices of rare eye of round. By comparison Mad Noodle's beef, while probably also eye of round, seems to have undergone the same process that a Subway restaurant subjects meat to to turn it into the tough, gray tragedy that it is.  The next horror, and I use this word literally, was the sharp chemical smell that hit me upon opening the garnish container. Despite a similar garnish set up, Pho Van's has never smelled this unnatural. I proceeded with caution by isolating each ingredient and smelling and tasting each. Nothing seemed too offensive, though the cilantro was a bit soapy smelling, which is normally not something I experience with cilantro, though I'm told that it is fairly common.  I added the noodles, beef and garnishes to my bowl, and poured the broth over it. There was no steam from the broth. I gently mixed it together, as the portions are quite large and filled my bowl to the brim. I took my first bite and found the broth to be utterly flavorless (save for, again, the inexplicable sensation of sweetness). I always taste the broth before modifying the flavor with things like lime, hoisin or Sriracha. For comparison, I find Pho Van's broth to be generally quite tasty, though I do tend to add some Sriracha to punch up the spice a bit, and a bit of hoisin to give it a faint twinkle of sweetness.  All in all, my experience with Mad Noodles was exactly what I should have expected (come to think of it, I think I complained about too much sweetness in my review of Lulu's as well). There honestly wasn't anything about that meal that I would want to experience again, and recall that I'm not even blaming them for the cold temperature of my food.  If you are in the mood for soup dumplings, you have to go to Squirrel Hill and eat at Everyday Noodles. That's it. We can all keep hoping for a legitimate competitor to appear, but it will take some doing.  If you are seeking pho, check out Pho Van in the Strip or Tram's Kitchen in Bloomfield.  If you are seeking Thai or ramen, options abound.  Whatever you decide, please don't deceive yourself: you cannot have it all in one place.",

We decided to split the Pork Soup Dumplings (order of 8) as an appetizer. I haven't found a place other than Everyday Noodles in Pittsburgh that really knocks these out of the park, but Mad Noodles were the best I've had in the city!   We then split an order of the Singapore Noodles (Spice level 2 of 5) which came with shrimp, tofu, beef and chicken! It was really nice to have the variety of meats included. The bartender was proactive and brought us over 3 different dipping sauces (A teriyaki type sauce, duck sauce, and chipotle mayo).

The server was a very nice young lady who did a great job of answering our questions. She was very knowledgeable about the food. She was great the whole time we were there. She was very attentive.  I ordered the Pho with beef meatballs. (You could also get beef tripe or regular beef). My hubby got Flat Noodles with shrimp. You could get 1-5 Heat choice. He went with 3.  My soup came and it was HUGE. You definitely weren't going to leave hungry. The broth, meatballs, and rice noodles were in the huge bowl. You were given a small square plate with a wedge of lime, fresh basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and fresh cilantro. I dumped it all in except the jalapenos. I took a few bites and I was disappointed.  The broth had zero flavor. The meatballs had a very weird texture. I'm weird about textures so it was off putting. It was grainy with bits that were gelatinous. I hardly ate any. I regretted not getting regular beef. I ate most of the noodles. I got the rest to go hoping that the basil and other side items would instill some flavor into the broth. I would not be eating the meatballs but maybe someone in our household would.  I tried my husband's Flat Noodles with shrimp. It was very good. A bit too spicy for me, but very flavorful.  I wouldn't rush to go back but I would go again to have the Flat Noodles or try the Street Noodles.",

    "text": "I've been to Mad Noodles twice over the last two weeks. The first time was for takeout, and the service was friendly and timely. I got a bubble tea (excellent, no issues there) while my boyfriend ordered the flat noodles with chicken. Normally he's not a picky eater, but he commented that the noodles were all spice and no flavor - I tried them and had to agree.   My second experience was a quick early dinner with a friend. Our waitress was enthusiastic, friendly and was happy to make recommendations. We started with the crab rangoons - they were tasty, but par for the course on such a simple appetizer. My friend ordered the Pad Thai - she was very happy with it, and the portion was so large that she had plenty to take home. I ordered the Japanese Ramen with pork belly and WOW - I can't rave about it enough. The broth was flavorful, not too salty, the pork belly plentiful and delicious: the bowl was huge and left me more than satisfied. I will definitely be returning!  Update: I've been back several times, ordered (too much) takeout, and this place is truly a gem. I can't rave enough, so I had to give them 5 stars!",

Normally prices this low would make me suspicious of the quality, but I've been visiting multiple times a week some time now and I've never had an issue.   I normally order take-out, but it's certainly worth dining in just to check out the design and local art.   **If you're a Gluten Free type, they'll swap the Cali roll for a tuna roll without the \"we said no substitutions\" type attitude.  Pro-tip: if you're ordering take-out and live near South Side or plan to pick-up your order, call first. There's free delivery if you're within range of the restaurant and you'll save them from paying commissions of delivery services.",

The Ramen was delicious as were the soup dumplings we got to start the meal.  Service was really good but there was a large group there at that same time and it got quite loud.  There seemed to be a really nice variety of Asian dished spanning noodles, soups and even sushi.  I'm not sure I'd go for take-out but eating there as definitely a winner.  I'd avoid the bathroom downstairs, it was a bit of a strange walk to get there.",

The buns were good but a bit tasteless. I enjoyed the soy sauce concoction that came with it, though.   The ramen was also tasteless. There was about zero salt in it. The egg was hard boiled with a hard yoke, not soft like it should be. The pork belly was tough and didn't taste that good. I didn't like that they put seaweed in it, either, it was overpowering since the broth wasn't good. The only thing I really liked was the bok choy and noodles.  Maybe their Thai would be better?",

I was craving Thai food so I placed an order for Spicy (level 4) pad Thai, chicken satay and Thai iced bubble tea. I got an email about 10 mins later explaining that my order had been cancelled as Eat Street could not get in touch with the restaurant to put it through. Okay - I was bummed but still starving so I ordered from an Indian restaurant on Grub Hub. So now I'm expecting a delivery but when my food arrived I was like wow this Indian place delivers FAST. It's dark outside, so I took my food in and realized when the light hit it that it was my Thai food order from Mad Noodles instead.. wtf. That's just the delivery aspect of my order.   EatStreet said they would still reimburse me on this order as I was told it was cancelled. Thankfully I didn't pay for this food from Mad Noodles or I would have been pissed. The chicken satay meat was a terrible quality and the peanut sauce was way too thick and sweet. I took a few bites of the pad Thai, same issues with the quality of the chicken meat. The bean sprouts were highly suspect. I picked all kinds of weird morsels out of my food (what looked like weird grey colored puffed rice?? and rotten bean sprouts). The flavor was not impressive to me in any way it was too salty, no sweet heat. Just yuck. I tried the Thai iced tea last and it was nasty how sweet it was. Plus the tapioca bubbles were mushy. I was more than disappointed with this order and any place that delivers to me is already ahead in my book. Just don't do it.",

    "text": "We were having a couple of staycation drinks nearby this past weekend when I decided to search out somewhere to grab a bite.  I noticed Mad Noodle was new and the idea of a big fat noodle carb filled spicy dinner delight was just the perfect follow-up to my frosty brew.  We walked in and settled down at the bar by the door.  I notice the small chalkboard on the bar advertising a happy hour from 5-7 every day.  You can get  1/2 off select apps.  Unfortunately the app I was interested was not included in the happy hour price, however that didn't deter me from ordering their steamed Asian Pork Buns, 6 come in an order for 8.95.  For my entree I knew I wanted some noodles and with some helpful suggestions from our server/bartender I went with the *Singapore Noodles with shrimp on a heat level of 4 out of 5.  The heat here is not as extreme as in other Asian restaurants in the city so if you aren't afraid of a little spice 4 is a safe bet.    Our buns were delivered and they were very good.  I could have probably eaten a dozen and I'm not kidding.  They were light and airy with a decent amount of filling.  This was a great start to our early dinner.  My entree was brought out shortly after our apps and it was steaming hot and fresh.  The spice level was perfect for me where it had a nice kick but I could still taste everything and it wasn't overpowering.  I couldn't finish it or I would have been in a carb coma but man those leftovers were great.  Even though I felt like I was on an episode of Miami Vice, seriously what's with the neon blue and pink lights?  It was a very good dining experience both food and service.",

    "text": "I wish I had known about this sooner! The noodle scene in Pittsburgh is picking up and it seems like there is a new place every month. Some of them have been izakaya-like places that serve Japanese ramen plus small tapa-like eats, and then there's also the Thai noodle place in Squirrel Hill. This particular place is interesting because although it is Chinese-run, their noodles and small bites are all over the place--pad thai and street noodles, ramen, pho, Singapore noodle, Lanzhou ramen, and more.   Given all that selection, we were only able to try the Singapore rice noodle and Thai wide noodle this time, and both were fantastic, the former probably being one of the best of its kind in the city. While stir-fried noodles are pretty easy to come by in many Asian places, it is often easy to screw it up, whether by being too soggy or too dry, or with stale ingredients. Both of these dishes hit the sweet spot with just enough sauce and fresh ingredients, and the noodles having absorbed all the flavor that comes with being cooked in a wok over a large fire. The prices are very reasonable as well; most dishes are around $10-12, while I've seen some of the places mentioned above easily go to $15 or more for a noodle soup.  The rest of the menu also had some more mainland Chinese appetizers and tapas like XLB and beef roll pancakes, which I'd be interested to try during a future visit (again, I haven't seen many of these elsewhere in Pittsburgh). The ambiance fits well for being a Southside joint, and in addition to having a bar they also serve boba. I even saw a sign advertising alcoholic boba--not sure how that'd be like, but sure is creative! Service was great as well. We came in 15 minutes to closing time, but our waitress was more than happy to accomodate us and give us recommendations.",

I ordered Thai Basil Chicken and my husband ordered Japanese Ramen and we shared soup dumplings. They all tasted great (especially my chicken!). I will definitely be coming to this spot again.

Food - awesome  Staff - awesome (Holly is super nice) Decor - welcoming  Bar -  (they have alcoholic bubble tea)  I judge a place harshly on their soup dumplings, their pho and their pad Thai.   I got the soup dumplings, the Vietnamese egg rolls (they come with 4 I just had to eat one before I took the pic) and the pho. All amazing. The pho was really flavorful (I got the combo minus the tripe).   They make their own hot oil in house which was amazing. My friend added it to her soy sauce and it was too good.   I need to get the pad Thai next time.   If you're looking for a low cost Noodle house and are in south side, I recommend this place.",

I ordered the lunch portion of the general tso chicken with white rice; all of the lunch prices were great (About $7-$8). They also give you an option with your lunch portions to choose either an egg roll or a crab rangoon. They didn't specify that only one crab rangoon would come with the meal, and that choice was my one regret. I would have chosen an egg roll instead because one crab rangoon was a tease and left me wanting more!  As far as the chicken goes, I wasn't very impressed. I would have been mad if I paid full price for it. It tasted like the chicken you'd get at a really cheap Chinese restaurant, and one of my pieces had tons of bones in it. I would not order a Chinese food option off of this menu again. I'd definitely give the Thai options a shot (plus the crab rangoon of course), however this experience didn't necessarily leave me wanting more unfortunately.",

The peppers, bean sprouts, and onions in the dish were cooked perfectly to still have a little bit of a crunch. And the chicken was not moist and seasoned. Serving size was massive! I had enough food for at least 3 meals, which is awesome for only paying $12. We also ordered the Steamed Pork Buns as an appetizer and they were delicious. Very airy and fresh, with flavorful pork inside. The sauce they provided on the side really made the dish. It had a little bit of a kick, but complemented the other flavors in the buns.   Atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. We had a small 2 person booth near the bar, but it felt intimate enough to have conversations all night long without having to shout over noise or be distracted by other guests. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She came to refill our water glasses whenever they came close to empty and checked on us, but also gave us our space to sit and enjoy the night. I would definitely come back here.",

It actually was on Easter Sunday and they were open so we stopped by.       Both times we came here we sat at the bar.  It has funky lights in there but it isn't distracting.  Customer service has been great each visit too.  We were watching the Pirates game this time on Easter Sunday.  We started off with their Steamed Pork Buns.  5 out of 5.  They were so good both times.  Steamed perfectly and there was a lot of good meat in them too.  These buns are one of the best we have tasted in the Burgh.  Our next course we ordered the Duck Slider.  It came with two sliders and we shared them.  There weren't as good as the buns but they were still good.  4 out of 5 for the slider.       The first time we came here I ordered the Sesame Chicken.  I though they were really good but this time I wanted wide noodles.  We were full by this time so we ordered our noodle dishes to go.  My wife ordered the Singapore Noodles with shrimp and I got the same thing but with chicken.  We both ate this at home and I really liked my noodles.  I thought they were perfect.  My wife liked hers too but she felt she didn't get enough shrimp.         Overall Mad Noodles has us Mad Nuts on Noodles and Buns.  We don't go to the South Side too often but this is now our go to place when were in the South Side.",

I have gone there with coworkers for lunch, birthday friends for a super casual dinner, both takeout and delivery and it has always been good for me. The prices are decent and the portions are large enough to share. I consider them my easy \"comfort\" noodle place.   I initially went for their soup dumplings, but almost always find myself currently ordering their Singapore noodles with everything or their flat rice noodle dishes. I don't think you can go wrong with either.   It's really easy to go wrong with Singapore noodles if it isn't served fresh, so I appreciate their efforts. The different appetizers are very good too.  I want to eventually branch out and try their house oxtail soup or eel over rice, but I can't seem to get past my crave worthy favorites.",

I didn't realize that they had happy hour which was until 7:00 PM for half off appetizers and specials on drinks. Definitely recommend the pork belly sliders, ramen and the Singapore rice noodles.   We started with the calamari and pork belly sliders as appetizers, honeydew bubble tea and a draft beer for drinks. The bubble tea was too powdery and way too sweet. Do not get the bubble tea! The calamari was mediocre as the quantity was small and the calamari was mostly breading (but it was part of the happy hour special).  The pork sliders were AMAZING!! it had a touch of cilantro which blended well with the flavors. I also really enjoyed the Singapore rice noodles which was huge! It had the right amount of spices and it definitely did not disappoint. The ramen was also really good as it had a good quantity of meat and the broth was delicious! The waiter had forgotten my drink and apologized numerous times which was nice of him. The service could be improved but they were definitely friendly. I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes.",

I happened to be on the street, was hungry, and saw the Mad Noodles sign and thought to myself, \"Noodles sound good.\" I stepped inside and was greeted with a very club/lounge look that is not at all what the outside leads one to expect. I sat down at the bar, ordered a beer, and started checking out the menu. The first good sign was craft beer on draft. There was a nice selection of noodle soups and dry noodles and I was feeling like a soup since it was cold outside. Duck always makes my mouth water and the Shredded Roasted Duck Rice Noodle Soup sounded perfect. As I waited for my order, the server brought over a sushi roll and said they were giving free sushi to anyone who sat at the bar that night. What a nice surprise! Shortly after that, my soup arrived and it was a massive bowl. The sushi was okay but far from anything considered to be great sushi. The soup was better but still seemed to be lacking something. It was a bit bland.   I could see myself stopping in again if I lived nearby but I doubt it would ever be a destination. The service was pleasant and the food arrived in good time. It was okay and there were no glaring negatives, it just did not wow me.",

I don't remember what it turned into after because I never went but thought the new name was clever and had to check it out and it did not disappoint!  The bartender, (who was also our server), Holly, was a doll - we loved her! Super friendly and always checked on us - really great!  As for the food,  first of all, I'm obsessed with pork belly so as soon as we saw pork belly 'sliders' as an app it was a done deal.   Perfection!  For our lunches, we got the ramen (with pork belly) :-) and also the Singapore noodles.  The ramen broth was like a miso - so flavorful and delicious.  The Singapore noodles were out of control delicious.  Will be back for more Singapore noodles for sure and will try other dishes.",

    "text": "Man these portions are MAAD big   Came here for lunch and ordered the pork soup dumplings, stir-fry beef with flat rice noodle (spice level 2) and flat rice noodle Thai style with chicken (spice level 3). The spice levels range from 1-5 but levels 2 and 3 were nowhere near spicy, especially level 3. The pork soup dumplings were yummy just like any other pork soup dumplings. The stir fry beef with flat rice noodle was good but I guess the beef was a bit on the salty side. The flat rice noodle Thai style with chicken had more flavor and was like a pad see yew just without bok choy and a soy sauce base. Also did I mention the portion size is huuuge.   I don't think the atmosphere inside is meant for lunch dining - maybe more for an evening because there's more of a bar feel. They also sell alcoholic bubble tea?? Wonder what that'd taste like...   The service wasn't too great. Although we were the only customers being served, the workers just seemed like they didn't care much because it wasn't that busy during the time we were there. But wouldn't that mean they'd give better service because they have more time? Also when we got our checks and cards back to sign the receipts, we weren't given any pens to sign with. So we resorted to using our own from our backpacks. I felt like that was just a lack of care for us customers.   Overall I felt like this was just another Thai restaurant but there are more better Thai restaurants in pittsburgh that I would go to than here.",

    "text": "SO HAPPY!!! This place used to be M&J bistro, but has done a complete 180 and I'm thrilled!   My s.o. and I had an unused Groupon for the old place and were reluctant to try it under the new name/concept.  We dragged ourselves here on a Wednesday and got to business.  We ordered the Thai fried rice, Singapore noodle and Japanese Ramen. All were so delicious and so flavorful. We got the rice with mixed meat, spice level 4.  Singapore (level 4) is 10x better than across the street. Ramen was so good and some of the better we've had in town.  We just got back from Japan and this will be our new spot for ramen for sure!  Spice game is strong and we love it!!",
