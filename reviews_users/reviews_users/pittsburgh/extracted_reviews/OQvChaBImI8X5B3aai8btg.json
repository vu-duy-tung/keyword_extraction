    "text": "We visited Waffles INCaffeinated with some family from out of town, and boy was it a good choice.   There was a short wait to be seated, but we needed that time to examine the menu. Everything looked fantastic. I tend be a particular about what I eat, so it is a rarity to find a menu where everything appeals to me. From the sweet to the savory, they had a wide variety of waffles available.   We settled on two savory waffles and one sweet. ( Breakfast Magic and  Souther' for savory, Peachy Keen for sweet ). There was a small issue with the Souther' waffle, as the egg on top was a little undercooked, but this was quickly remedied by the staff.   I must say that after having tried three of their waffles, I can't wait to try the rest. The Souther' waffle had a great spicy note to it, the Breakfast Magic didn't skimp on the bacon, and the Peachy Keen was a delicious sweet treat, made even better by their vanilla syrup.   We also sampled the side order of sweet potato waffle fries, with a marshmallow fluff jerk dipping sauce. The sauce definitely made the fries worth it, giving a nice balance to the flavor of the sweet potato.   All in all, a very satisfying Waffle offering in Pittsburgh. The only complaint I could muster up is that their hours are inconvenient. Their selection of waffles would be a fantastic late-night bite, alas they close at 3pm on weekdays, 2pm weekend.",

Then the put a dippy egg on top of the omelette. Again, who woulda thunk it!? Their multi colored fried potatoes are equally delicious as they are nice to look at. They have many types of waffles (obviously, hence the name of the establishment) my boyfriend got ones that had jalapenos on them and pico and came with a jack Daniels infused (if I'm remembering correctly) syrup. Delicious. Everything I've had here is amazing, I cannot give it 5 stars though do to the price. I got a chocolate milk which I realize normally doesn't come with free refills anywhere, but even the one chocolate milk was over priced for the tiny glass it came in. The food is also pricey. The restaurant is not very large either, so there is normally a wait. The staff is generally friendly but I have definitely had better service elsewhere. They also have odd hours, I assume since they are primarily a breakfast place. But otherwise, it's definitely a place to check out next time you're in Southside with a hangover on a Sunday morning!",

A rather large fluffy waffle with several pieces of boneless fried chicken tenders with a really good breading. There were also scallions and pecans strewn about the dish, which I really enjoyed. I also tried the sweet potato fries with marshmallow jerk dipping sauce. Everything was very tasty and there is no doubt waffles inc is a must visit if you are in the southside.",

I am not even a huge waffle or pancake fan. I had the Waffles Benedict with bacon instead of crab. It was delicious! I didn't need syrup! Speaking of syrup, they have an AMAZING collection of different types of syrups to try out. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer it up to anyone. My boyfriend had to ask for it. He got the bourbon syrup. It was in a Jim Beam bottle! I was soo impressed with it, but sad they didn't offer their awesome syrups upon ordering or delivering the food. I will have to go back and try the other kinds! They seemed like they were a hot commodity as another server came over to pick up the syrup and pass it onto another table. Try them! They are delicious.  Overall, the service was good, food was a little pricey for what it was but well worth trying out. I'll definitely be back to try a new dish, and syrup for that matter.",

Perhaps we should have called first. We put our names in, gave our phone number and were told it would probably be an hour wait. My boyfriend really wanted to go here, so we said fine.  We wandered around the area (found Big Dog), and while we were sitting and lounging, only a half hour into our wait, we got a text from Waffles Incaffeinated that our table was ready and to text back if we were coming - very efficient system if you ask me.   We walked back, and were seated and our server, while she was crazy busy came over almost immediately. My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles with vanilla syrup (I think he should have gone with bourbon maple, but that's just me). I went with make your own omelet, and basically did the Caprese Crab, without the crab. I really liked the tri-colored home fries that came with it, and they were well seasoned. My omelet was super fluffy. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and waffles - a favorite of his. I would have liked the orange juice to be fresh squeezed. I mean for $3.75 for an 8 oz glass, I kind of expect it?   The thing my boyfriend was not pleased about was the buser came over and asked if I was finished with my plate, and I said yes, and he took my plate AND my boyfriend's plate, despite that fact that my boyfriend was still working on the last few bites of food. Like pulled the plate away as my boyfriend was still eating the last few morsels of food. Not really a fan of that. But, the food was good, and I would still recommend for breakfast, just call ahead.",

    "text": "This place has been on my radar for awhile now, so I'm happy to have had the chance to stop by during the week recently. On a Friday morning around 10ish, we breezed right in, but I can see why this place would be bonkers on the weekends...it's not terribly big on the inside. Definitely take advantage of the NoWait app if you're attempting to come here on a weekend.  Anyhow, waffles are obviously the name of the game here, and they try to elevate this humble breakfast carb with their gourmet offerings. My husband and I ordered two waffles (the Funky Monkey and the Chicken and Waffles) and went halvsies.   The waffles were presented beautifully. The Funky Monkey was a decadent treat, a waffle spiked with chocolate chips, topped with bananas and a peanut butter chiffon, finished with chocolate syrup. The waffle itself was a bit soggy towards the middle (probably on account of the moisture from the chiffon, which was in the center), but it was appropriately crisp towards the outer edges. This is definitely the kind of heavy, sweet, carb-coma-inducing waffle that lowers expectations for what you'll be able to accomplish for the rest of the day. The chicken and waffles, by contrast, was a little more substantial. It was a pecan-infused waffle with three maple-butter glazed chicken tenders adorning the top, finished with scallions. I preferred this one to the Funky Monkey, as it was a great balance of sweet and savory. It could've used a little more salt though, and they were rather stingy with the amount of pecans in the waffle batter itself.  When you get down to brass tacks and remember that these are just humble waffles in fancy clothes, prices seem a little high (close to $10 per waffle). However, for some reason, that day the Funky Monkey was on special for $5 (not sure if it's a limited time special or this occurs every Friday), so that was a welcomed surprise. Service was excellent...we never saw the bottom of our water or coffee. Overall, we enjoyed our breakfast, and while I wouldn't make a special trip back here, I'd definitely return next time I'm in the area.",

The crowded tables are certainly a testament to how good the food is. The main reason I wanted to go was for the gluten free waffles- which didn't disappoint! The menu has many pre-made waffle options, as well as build-you-own options. I got the gluten free waffle, with nutella, foster sauce, bananas, and walnuts on top. I was very happy! The portion size was big enough to take it home and enjoy it for lunch later. My husband was able to mix two of the pre-made waffles together for a spicy dish. Prices were fair for the portion size, but the drink options were all a little hefty for how small they were. I would definitely go again!",

There are gluten-free waffles.  They are huge, perfect, Belgian-style deliciousness.  There is a long list of add-ins that you can put in the batter, and another but mostly overlapping list of toppings, both including savory items as well as sweet.  You can build your own or go with one of the house specials, but either way you're going to get delicious waffle-y goodness, cooked to perfection and served hot.  As the name may suggest, there's also a decent selection of caffeinated beverages.  I know zero about coffee, but the tea selection is good - a number of black teas and one green, all from Two Leaves and a Bud, which is solid quality for a bagged tea.    The space is nice and mellow, service is good, and I will definitely be back.",

We arrived just before 10 on a Saturday morning and were seated in about 2 minutes in a packed house.  We must have timed it jusssssst right because a wait formed after us with guests lining the sidewalk to wait for waffly bliss.  On deck - coffee, an order of sweet potato waffle fries with the marshmallow dip, a Souther' and the special.    Coffee was on point.  Very good coffee, hot, and frequently refilled by our attentive waitress.  Waffle Fries - fries were standard, it was the dip we were looking forward to!  Unfortunately, the dip came served to us pretty cold, and the marshmallow had set so that it was almost impossible to dip.  The dip was delicious, but serving temperature is key on this one.  Cold marshmallow = high viscosity.  Waffles - both entrees were good.  I really liked the Souther', which had plenty of jalapenos tucked IN to the waffle.  I'm not used to having my mouth tingle while eating waffles, which was great.  Sadly, the waffles were a little cold for both my wife's entree and my own.  They were slammed - I get it - but I shouldn't see the cheese only half-melted and cooled enough to re-harden when the plates are being dropped at the table.  We enjoyed WI and we'll go back, and I hope the cold entrees and app were just a fluke.  If that's the case, we'll be in 4-star territory on our way to 5.",

    "text": "I have been a huge fan of Waffles Incaffienated for the last few years. I understand they do not take reservations and that they use the \"no wait\" app, which is usually great. I got to the restaurant when the app told me 10-15 minutes and there were 3 people ahead of me in line. When I checked in with the guy at the front table he told me it would be 10 minutes. I watched him seat 6 other tables and waited 45 minutes before I was seated. Once we were seated, our waitress was kind and attentive but the food took way too long to come out - About another 45 minutes for 2 waffles and 1 omelette. The food is usually great but for the second time, my poached egg was way over cooked.      The last few times I have been, the service has been slow, the food has taken a while, and the coffee was cold. I've given this place many chances but sadly, I'm thinking its time to give up.",

The waffles were fantastic (I had Breakfast Magic and the other person had the sausage gravy waffles) and our server, Jeremy, was friendly and very attentive.  Only downfall that I noticed was a slight fly \"problem.\"  I hesitate to say \"problem\" as there was only a gnat floating around us, it wasn't like a swarm or anything.  I get it, there's syrup, fruit, doors opening, etc, and impossible to control it entirely, but if other Yelpers noted it too......#justsayin  We got here a bit before 10:30 on a Saturday with no wait.  A few minutes after we were seated, there was a line waiting.  While there were people waiting, the tables seemed to remain un-seated after they were cleaned for longer than I'd expect.  Our service was great, though, so all I can say is I'd suggest you come early!  Bottom line: great waffles, try the bourbon syrup, ask for Jeremy, and get here early.",

Not to mention that it takes 1+ hours to make a waffle at 1pm on a Tuesday??? The food is good, but the place is cramped. It just isn't worth the hassle. Also, good luck using a groupon there...They tack on about 50 rules that aren't mentioned on the actual groupon and it took me 4 tries to get them to actually take it. And then the waiter says \"Oh, you are one of them...\" Whatever, I didn't sell the groupons that you obviously hate.",

This wasn't a bad thing, and I'm not sure if that's common, it was just unexpected. The coffee was great as well.

Our server (I'm sorry I can't remember her name, but she had blue hair) was so wonderful. My daughter was acting weepy all morning and it all finally culminated with her throwing up at WI. Yikes!! I've been a server and I know what a pain this can be when it happens. But our server was so accommodating! She gave us the towels to clean it, brought my daughter some Sprite to settle her stomach, checked on her multiple times, and was generally one of the best servers ever. NOT TO MENTION - all of our food was fantastic!! Fresh and delicious. I'll return here just for the service, and the food is a nice cherry on top. Great job WI! I can't rave enough.",

I got the Chicken and Waffles.  The description says \"pecan infused.\"  It's a plain waffle with a handful of pecan halves thrown in.  It was not what I expected.  The chicken is frozen chicken tenders.  The menu says it has some type of maple butter glaze, but it really doesn't. There might have been a little bit on the chicken.  Maybe.  The dish is topped off with a handful of chopped green onions, which is odd. The savior was the vanilla bean syrup, which was great on the chicken, and the maple syrup which was great on the waffle.  Ask for both.  I was not a fan of the bourbon syrup, it tasted of straight alcohol.  The meal was good, I was just expecting a little more.  The boyfriend got the Carnivore Omelette and home fries.  He enjoyed both.",

The iced chai was more creamer or milk than it was tea. Then when my waffles came out it looked really good asthetically but they were not something I would order again. The chicken tenders were really dry and hard to eat and the waffle itself was ok but you cant really mess up a waffle. I like the flavor of the maple syrups but I wasnt a fan at how watery they were. When me and my cousin got our checks they dicounted her food which was odd because we didnt send anything back or complain at all. Overall the food was pretty cheap I would maybe come back to try something else and give it a second chance.",

We ordered the Souther' Waffle, the Funky Monkey, and the Sacre Bleu-Berry (French toast). We were all super satisfied with our food!

I'm personally not a fan of the waffles however it's due to my own personal preference. The Waffles are soft and fluffy.  I prefer my waffles with a slight crack to it. The family gets the chicken waffles, comes with breaded chicken tenders that are very tender. The other gets their waffles with multiple fixins mixed inside.  Overall good food.  Very busy and tight in space on the weekends.",

The bourbon maple syrup definitely tastes like the real thing, and is really good over the chicken and waffles. They have numerous waffle specials such as the funky monkey which the table next to me ordered and it looked really good delicious. If you are not into waffles, they have a typical egg and breakfast meat specials and if you don't eat pork they even have turkey bacon and chicken sausage as well. I came with my daughter this time and she enjoyed the food as well. Next time I'm here I'll make sure to bring my Aunt and little cousins who live in the nearby Mt. Washington neighborhood.",

They notify you by text when your table is ready which is a great concept. We didn't mind that. When we ordered I started with a latte, single shot, breve, low foam. They couldn't accommodate me, and they didn't know what breve meant. When I asked our waiter who the barrista was he replied he was. I informed him that a barrista would have known what Breve was. Need I go any further? Our food came, and the waffles weren't half bad, but they weren't the best we've had. The service was good, the coffee terrible, and my recommendation would be to take a trip to Philadelphia to the Green Egg Cafe in Northern Liberties and see and taste what great food is-especially the coffee.

The coffee is supposed to be unlimited, but I got one refill, 30 minutes after I had finished my first cup. After we finally got our food, our waiter forgot about my home fries, probably because he didn't write anything down. We finished our food and still no home fries.

    "text": "This is my second visit to Waffles Inc. I had to come back to try the waffles this time. Even though I ordered a carb loaded, paleo nightmare, it was worth every single solitary bite.    I went balls to the wall and ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of potatoes. Not a fruit or a veggie in sight, but sometimes you just have to go there, you know?  The potatoes were a medley of purple, orange, red, and white potatoes that I think were roasted. If they were fried they weren't greasy at all. They were perfectly seasoned with a hint of onion and green pepper that didn't over power the potato taste. -I think there were parsnips in there too. D-fricken-lish.  The waffle?  Holy sh*t. It was plated with a sprinkle of scallions and 3-4 breaded/fried chicken tenders that were drizzled with a sweet maply syrup, but it didn't make the breading soggy. The waffle was absolutely perfect. It was a toasty brown color on the outside and was soft and bready inside. I had to stop and observe a moment of silence for all the people with gluten intolerance who will never be able to indulge in the goodness. ********amen********  Every couple bites surprise you with a sweet pecan. (I think they were pecans-might have been walnuts. I may not know nuts, but i know they added great flavor.  The waffle was so good I didn't even put butter on it.   The server offered three different kinds of syrup, vanilla, bourbon, or maple. He recommended the maple, and it did not disappoint.    The wait was over an hour, but I didn't mind it. If you go on a weekend, you will wait, but don't be a jerk about it. Plan ahead and enjoy a great meal. I can't wait to try their other dishes.",

There was a bit of a wait when I got there with my friend, but it was no problem.  The host took my phone number and told me it would be about 20 min so my friend and I decided to walk around for a little to pass the time.  I received a phone call after about 15 minutes and we were good to go.  The decor was really nice.  Didn't strike me as consistent with a place known for waffles, but I'm not complaining! Our waitress was very nice and took good care of us.  We never really had to wait for anything.    I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was a waffle that was stuffed with peppers and chorizo with an egg on top.  It was amazing.  The peppers had so much flavor and so did the chorizo.  It was delicious.  I asked for the egg on top to be cooked over easy and it was exactly right.  This meal was unbelievably filling and I would recommend it to anyone.  They had a little trouble with their credit card machine right at the end of our visit, but they ended up getting it fixed so there was no trouble.  All in all this was a great experience from start to finish and I would go back.",

All the waffles on the menu looked really good - I could not chose between sweet - the funky monkey, the berry one or doing savory - waffles benedict, waffles and gravy or the one with the cheese, bacon and fried egg on top.  So I created my own concoction of waffle with bacon and peanut butter chips, topped with peanut butter fluff and sliced banana.  It was really good - I didn't even need syrup but I did try a little  of the bourbon maple which was not overly bourbon flavored.  I also got scrambled eggs that were cooked well and the waitress was nice and never let the coffee cup go empty.  I hope to go back to this place to try out new fun concoctions with the all mix-in's and toppings to chose from.",

I wouldn't be opposed to coming back trying the waffles, perhaps it will earn this place more stars.   The waitress was very friendly and on top of things.   I will have to comment on how hot it was in there, they turned on the air but it just seemed like we were really hot for a few minutes then, we got chilly.

I also had a mixup with the server and what I ordered but I'm not sure if it was my not ordering clearly or her mistake.

No napkins on the table neither can be located  anywhere near the table, I guess if you're drinking or eating you won't need any, or may be they bring some with food so they think you may not need it before food arrives.

How you only have two waiters for the restaurant is beyond me. How it takes 50 minutes to prepare and omelette and a waffle is beyond me.   How this place gets a 4 star review again, is beyond me.  My waffle came out soggy, chicken was cold. I've been to this place 3-4 times based on proximity, and consistent great reviews - I figured maybe I just caught it at a bad time.   Nope.

We drove 30 minutes to go to this place on Sunday with an out of town guest used the app no-wait, were sixth in line when we got there, waited 10 minutes to get up to the desk, and were turned away because we had signed up for waffles incaffeinated downtown and not south side.  Actually the downtown one is really in Wexford.   The mgr basically told us to go blank ourselves and he doesn't care, if we want to eat we are at bottom of list!  He will not move us up under any condition.  We left, had a great breakfast at Bartram and will NEVER return to this or any waffles incaffeinated restaurants.  Customer service??  This mgr has no clue!    Received a note from Waffles...totally do not understand the issue.  Yes, we misunderstood downtown Pittsburgh for Carson St.   However, by your response, we are obviously not the first people to have this happen.  The real problem is your and your management team failing to recognize what True customer service is.  Your manager offered to put us at the BOTTOM of the list!  We had no time for that, there was no effort to expedite us or assist us in any way, he didn't care if we stayed or left! Sadly, after looking at all of your negative reviews on yelp and other sites, way too many for my comfort, I believe you did us a favor.",

Located right on Carson, it's a great place to people watch. The waitress was great; professional and attentive, refilling my coffee without a reminder three times (pet peeve is waiting for a coffee refill) . On that note, their coffee(regular and decaf) is sourced from Beaver, and is really tasty. So, my husband got the berry waffles and I decided on the vegetarian omelet (which for some reason I can't find on the menu now, but it's there!)  The berry waffle was a warm, large waffle topped with strawberries and whipped creme. They also brought out what I think was homemade syrup? He was impressed, and from my bite I was too.  The real winner was me, though. The omelette came out white and fluffy and full of veggies and cheese! The veggies were fresh and NOT overcooked, the feta cheese just enough . There was a drizzling of spicy Mayo on top that added just enough kick for me, and I live spicy stuff. I added a side of pico for the potato side, which was cooked perfectly and salted just enough! Will ABSOLUTELY be going back again",

Going against my natural inclination to order something sweet, I went instead for a savory waffle selection and got the Souther. The jalapeno, cheese and chorizo combination topped with a perfectly cooked over easy egg was too much to pass up! It really was amazing! Who knew stuffing waffle batter with jalapenos was a good idea? Well, it is!! My wife's sweet potato waffle with the figs, apples, cranberries and candied walnuts was totally AMAZING!! I kept reaching over for bites - after all, a sweet AND savory brunch experience seems to be the complete package, right? It was!!  My favorite of the 4 selections was the Fosters though. Bananas, walnuts and ice cream? Oh yeah!! Lovin it!  The Bourbon Maple syrup (Jim Beam and maple syrup) was addicting and I'd go back just for a cup of that alone!  While I understand why it's crowded, I still think the service could have been better. Coffee refills were slowwww (good coffee though!) and I had to wait far too long to get my syrup - to the point that my waffles started to get cold. And I wanted that Bourbon syrup! I'm willing to overlook that this time and hope it was just a bad day.  Next time, I'm going sweet and have already picked out my selection - Funky Monkey. I'm a sucker for chocolate and man, this one made me drool! Can't wait to go back.",

I went with the breakfast magic this time with an egg over easy! Oh my heaven! Savory waffle goodness! Bourbon syrup was the magic touch to this signature waffle!   My daughter decided to build her own. Going savory she added to the inside bacon, cheddar & spinach. Outside was a fried egg & tomato. She too went for the bourbon syrup & was a happy girl!   My husband went for a full order of sausage gravy waffle. Gravy was over flowing with sausage.   Both my daughter & husband had the fresh coffee. It was good & hot & refilled quickly.   Staff is friendly, talkative & keep things moving & fun!   I can't stress enough how you must try this place at least once on your Pittsburgh travels! I'm going sweet waffle next trip!

My friend and her dad both stayed on the sweet side and ordered megaberry waffles, and he additionally had bottomless coffee.  I can only speak for my waffle, since I didn't try theirs.  The waffle itself was crisper than I expected based on previous reviews, which was great, since I enjoy crisp waffles.  The ratio of toppings to waffle was plentiful, and consisted of the components of classic Eggs Benedict (Canadian bacon, poached eggs, and Hollandaise sauce), as well as some real crab meat and a few scallions.  Unfortunately, I found the Hollandaise sauce rather flavorless and underseasoned, which led me to wonder what went into it (margarine or unsalted butter, perhaps?) and how it was made (blender method?).  Moreover, as others have mentioned, the portion was a bit small, esp. given the price (over $9).  While our server was friendly and courteous, and was able to answer my questions, I also found the 25-30 min. wait for our food to be quite lengthy, esp. given that not all of the tables were filled.  At other places serving breakfast food, the wait has been half as long, which leads me to believe that the kitchen is inefficient at getting out orders in a timely manner. Fortunately, we weren't in a rush, but this is something to consider if you're pressed for time.  Despite these shortcomings, my guests and I enjoyed our meal at Waffles Inc., so I was torn between 3.5 and 4 stars.  However, for me, a 4 star experience must contain no more than one major shortcoming, so 3.5 stars it is.  Having said that, I would certainly be willing to return and to try a different waffle, which would hopefully allow me to increase my rating.",

    "text": "I am not a waffle or sweets-for-breakfast person 99% of the time. So I knew I was going to be looking to other parts of the Waffles INC menu to find my breakfast. There were actually quite a few non-waffle-y choices, though most of them were on the heavy side (think eggs benedict, monte cristos, etc.) and I really needed something that wasn't going to sit in my belly like a lead weight all day long. I ended up creating my own omelet with ham, cheddar and pico de gallo on the side. The omelet was just the right size and had the perfect amount of ham and cheese - not too much and not too little.   Our server was sweet and went out of her way to make sure we were happy. I tried a bite of Rachel C's coconut and berry waffles but they didn't really do anything for me. I would have preferred a little bit of a crunch but these were on the doughy, soft side of the waffle spectrum.   Cute restaurant and a fun, if a little bit kitschy, concept. Give them a shot and decide for yourself!",

We liked the green and black color scheme. J and I both ordered the create your own waffles. His came with bananas, chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream with regular maple syrup. I had coconut, chocolate chips, and blue berries inside with blood orange sauce and vanilla bean infused syrup. Everything was absolutely delicious!! We loved the different combinations and had a difficult time choosing our toppings and fillings. There were so many other delicious options that we plan on making another trip to sample the make your own omelettes. We also met the most amazing patrons at the restaurant who let us sample their food because it looked so good! Definitely one of our new favorite spots!",

I was there last weekend with my boyfriend, we sat outside and was greeted and offered drinks. We ordered our food shortly after, 30 mins has passed and a party of 3 sat next to us and part of 7 sit. Another 15 mins pass and the table of 3 next to us recieves their food, I also need to mention that 2/3 people next to us ordered the exact same thing I did. At this point we are annoyed that they got their food before us and sat 30 mins after. A few minutes pass, and THE PARTY OF 7 get there food as well. I bring this to our servers attention and she assures that our food will be coming out shortly. We were already sitting for an hour, not a single manager came out to speak to us, no compensation for the inconvenience, nothing. Mistakes happen, but fix it if you can. We left after an 1.25 hours with no food.",

They are on the No Wait app so you can put your reservation in from the comfort of your home. They'll shoot you a text whenever your table is ready. You can also call in and they will put you on the waitlist. They were slammed when we walked in on Sunday. When we arrived around 9:45 there was already a big crowd, and then it grew to be even larger by the time we left an hour later. Love that they have a vegan waffle option. Waffles are huge and they have tons of fillings and toppings you can get to customize either a sweet or savory waffle. They also have soy milk and a nice coffee menu, the cappuccino was huge and served piping hot, very delicious. My boyfriend got a side of potatoes with his savory waffle and I loved those just as much as my waffle. Variety of potatoes including sweet & purple, so great! Will definitely be back again soon.",

I saw the description of the August crepe special on Facebook and had to go in for it: \"Augustus Bacon Crepes featuring a maple-peach cream cheese with bacon crumbles filling in three of our waffle batter crepes with each crepe adorned with a rose of house made peanut butter fluff.\"  This was my first time having their crepes and they were excellent. Such great flavor combinations! The waffle crepe isn't exactly like a standard crepe but it was thin and light. I was full after two crepes and got a box to take the third home.  Overall it was a good lunch visit but here are the reasons why I didn't give 5 stars: -The server didn't know the monthly specials and I wasn't given a menu with them on it. I asked for the crepe special and he was like, \"the Elvis?\" I had to tell him that the Elvis was the the waffle special and that what I wanted was a different special. -They were out of chai tea -My takeout container had a lid that was nearly impossible to fit to the bottom. Hopefully this was just one faulty container and they aren't all like this.",

    "text": "Terrible service, small portions, and weak coffee. -- The bad service was partially due to poor staffing as there were empty tables but we still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated.  We were seated outside which seemed nice for but this made us invisible to our waitress as none stopped by after 20 minutes. I went inside and mentioned it to the Host.  He told me that he would take care of it.  After another 5 minutes without seeing our waitress I went inside and spoke with him again.  He then called across to the girl at the register saying \"who has table 35?\"  I told him that I was going to stand there until my waitress was ready.  After finally meeting our waitress, she walked out with me and took our order.  We ordered coffee and food and asked for the coffee first.  After about 3-4 minutes she brought three waters which none of us ordered and still no coffee! After another 5 minutes went by I went in again and I saw our waitress bringing coffee to another table.  I then asked to speak to the manager. Mark, the manager came out and I told him of my experience and pointed out that a woman only a few reservations before me in line was finishing her meal with her family and we could not get a cup of coffee.  He apologized but at the same time was defensive. We finally got our coffee which was weak and not good.  Mark came over to the table and gave us free coffee for our trouble!  The food was good overall but the omelet was small for an $11 omelet.  The waffle was overpriced, good but not great.  Just about what you could do with an instant mix and waffle iron.  Lots of air, not very dense.  After eating we all went away almost hungry.",

The waitresses talked too fast and I couldn't understand them and got snippy when I asked them to clarify. Will not return. Waffles incaffinated? More like waffles insuckinated",

This was my second visit, and I'm actually glad that I waited to leave a review. My girlfriend and I came in at 1:22 PM on a Wednesday. First thing the hostess says was, \"You're going to be our last table of the day! I was going to say no, but you seem nice!\" ...Okay, awkward...but...okay.  Before eating, she yelled \"Promise this is the last one,\" to the cooks. ....okay.  While eating, we were forced to listen to the hostess and a server celebrate their approaching off days, and complain about how much they do not like working...all while sitting at a table 10 feet away from us....cleaning the day's utensils...in the middle of the dining area. Then, the hostess went ahead and sprayed/wiped every table in the place, while we were eating...even more awkward.  And, to ice the cake...she asked if we wanted ketchup, we said yes, and she just never brought it...lol. This was the least of my worries, but hey, it happened.  0/5 on the service, 5/5 on the food. I rounded down to a 2 because my overall experience was complete garbage. I'll never go back.",

    "text": "Waffles INCaffenated is my new favorite breakfast joint on the South Side.  I had the Benny (their take on eggs Benedict), with a side of bacon and potatoes.  This was my first ever savory waffle and it was completely awesome.  The tender, crispy and slightly sweet waffle, underneath the poached egg, with the tasty H sauce all worked together nicely.  Now, I'm never ga-ga about anyone's potatoes, but the recos on Yelp were not wrong.  I got a little square bowl of chopped and fried potatoes of nearly every color: purple, yellow, sweet little orange bits...  all perfectly (and surprisingly) well-seasoned!  That brings me to one final observation:  there are no condiments on the tables.  None.  I didn't even notice until I was licking my fingers in delight.  A breakfast restaurant that knows how to season food - that's what's up.  I'll can't wait to try some of the other menu items, but for now I'm stuffed.  Oh, BTW:  you'll notice I said nothing about the bacon.  It wasn't worth a mention.  It's $3 for three very ordinary slices.  Skip that.  Get the potatoes!",

    "text": "Nothing to complain about, but I would say there are other restaurants that serve up pretty much the same things as Waffles Incaffeinated.  So, unless I was in the area or lived nearby, I probably wouldn't come back.  The menu is a decent size, but I did expect to see more inventive and varied uses of the waffle, considering this is the premise of the restaurant.  There's basically two kinds of sweet waffles (berries or a combo of bananas and chocolate) or a few savory waffles (a normal breakfast with a waffle thrown in).  The waffles themselves are also nothing spectacular.  It almost tasted like the waffles were just microwaved.  They weren't golden brown or with that nice crisp crust, but instead more soft and chewy.    Now for the positives, as I did, overall, enjoy my meal there.  The service is quick and you can use the \"No Wait\" app to put yourself on the waitlist.",

    "text": "My first time at Waffles Incaffeinated was amazing. It's my new favorite breakfast place, and I would recommend anyone to come here! I got here around 9:15am, and we were seated immediately. Come the 10:00am/10:30am hour, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.   The food was fabulous and affordable. I got the Funky Monkey with bourbon vanilla ice cream with vanilla syrup, and my friend got the Florentine crepes. I highly recommend both. The crepes are nice because the savory inside filling (chicken, mushroom, spinach) compliments the sweetness of the waffle batter. The crepe itself is quite thick, almost like a very thin pancake (very flour-y). This plate could easily feed 3 people, as they served 3 rolls of crepes. It looked like a hot mess, because it comes with field greens tossed in a vinaigrette on top. It's not picture pretty, but it is so. darn. good. My friend and I split the Funky Monkey, and I also ordered a scoop of bourbon vanilla ice cream to go on top (is there any other way to eat waffles? For breakfast?...) Sadly, they were out of the Java, coffee flavored ice cream, but the bourbon vanilla was a good choice too. It complimented all the flavors of the waffle. It comes with a creamy dollop of peanut butter, a portion of a Hershey's chocolate bar, and sliced bananas (probably 1 whole or 3/4 of a banana). The presentation was thoughtful and fun.   All in all, love the huge, typical American high-caloric, Diabetes-inducing portions :-) Service was great; never saw the bottom of my coffee mug as the waitress was always around asking if we needed more, and the interior design is full of modern, clean lines, and bold colors. I would come here every weekend if I could.",

The selection was disappointing and while they were totally accommodating to my veggie needs, they had zero prebuilt savory veggie options.

He did let us know that there was an issue in the kitchen which is why the wait was so long so it might just be a one off thing. We had the chicken and waffle which was delicious, the mega berry which was also v good and had a very generous serving of berries. The funky monkey was a little disappointing but maybe it's not the waffle to order if you want something chocolate-y. All in all we would definitely go back",

    "text": "Went for brunch while visiting my sister at Pitt. There was a wait but it wasn't too bad and there was room to wait inside which was nice since it was freezing out!  I chose this place because they had vegan waffles, but I was pretty disappointed to see that there's a $3.50 upcharge for a vegan waffle and a $2-something upcharge for gluten/dairy/soy free waffle.  It's great to see options, but I don't really understand how they can charge that much for a vegan waffle. That made my waffle cost $15.50 with 4 add-ins which was a little much for one waffle.  Be warned- each topping/add-in costs $1.25!!!  The menu prices did not have $ signs next to them, so it's easy to not notice prices.  I did not realize that when ordering since the menu said \"unlimited toppings\" (meaning you could technically get unlimited, not that unlimited are included in the price) so don't do what I did and order a bunch and then be shocked when the bill comes. That being said, it was pretty good. I got a soy latte (thankfully no upcharge for soy milk) and I really liked it. All of us liked our food (chicken and waffle, southwest omelet, and souther' waffle). Good hot tea selection. Service was fast and nice. My sister and her friend said they will definitely come back. Overall- good food but be careful when creating your own waffle and you may be better off making a waffle at home if you're looking for vegan options.",

I remembered that they use the No Wait app & quickly put our spot in line via app. It estimated 14 parties ahead of us & about 45-60min wait. You can track your place in line and it went very quickly.. a good 30 minutes.  For breakfast i ordered the funky money & bobby ordered the bananas fosters. We were informed by our server that the bananas were not ready and very green. She offered a substitute & we both decided on strawberries. While tasty, it just wasnt the same. The funky monkey is chocolate, PB & bananas.. not the same with strawberries. Same with bobbys bananas fosters... but we decided it was an excuse to come back and check it out.  While the waffle was fine, service just wasnt too well. After receiving waffle, she asked if we wanted syrup. I asked for maple and bobby vanilla. I waited to eat my waffle for a good ten minutes before she came back refiling coffee and realizing i didnt have syrup.(bobby never got his) This is fine but the last part was odd. When paying, she came back with a booklet and copies of the receipts.. with our table and two others. It's not a huge deal but as a server you should always check card & table numbers when paying and returning back to person  The service & mediocre coffee is stopping me from 4 stars. I do plan to head back and try it out again though.",

We didn't have a wait as the rush had died by then.  If you can wait that long or wake up super late, then I would suggest that as the perfect time to go.  They are also on the No Wait app, so we've gone there before using this app.  It makes it so much easier to plan for.  I ordered the Straw-nana Crepe with Home Fries and they are beyond amazing.  We also ordered flavored shots to go with our coffee.  Our waitress was nice and the staff all seem to enjoy their job.  I observed them joking around with each other, so it helps the atmosphere.  I've seen some other ratings complaining about the wait for food. You do seem to wait a really long time, even if you order the minute you sit down.",

    "text": "Waffles Incaffeniated is one of those places I have been meaning to get to but not made it to.  So when my friend asked me where I wanted to go for birthday brunch, I suggested here.  We arrived at 9:30 am on a Thursday, and we were probably the first people in for the day.  This made street parking super easy.  The atmosphere is very casual but has a trendy ish vibe.  We decided to get the Benny and the Sausage Gravy waffles.  I think each one was $9.65.  The Benny is Eggs Benedict on a waffle, and they also put crab on top.  The waffle we got was cold and covered in freezing crab.  The actual taste with the warm egg was pretty decent, but no one wants to pay over $9 for half of a cold waffle.  The Sausage Gravy waffles were preferable but still only warm at best.  They were also mushy, implying that our food sat in the back for a while.  So while both options tasted good, they needed some more love and care in the preparation area.  We also ordered a fruit cup that was presented nicely but also freezing.  I am not sure why all of the food was freezing to lukewarm in temperature, but it was a big turn off.  One weird pet peeve, they do not have a working website.  There is nothing worse than choosing somewhere to eat and not being able to see an online menu with current prices.  It's 2016; there is no excuse for no website.  The service here was lackluster as well, and while the idea is creative, I am not totally feeling this place.  I am definitely in the 3-4 star camp for Waffles Incaffeniated, but as I am not running to come back here, I think three stars is more fair.",

The syrup is way too thinned down, it made the waffles mush and was way too sweet. I regret paying $25 plus tax and tip @$32 for the food and drink portion but appreciated the wait staff.

There were pieces of sausage and green onion mixed into the waffle batter, which made for a nice surprise every few bites. Pico de galo topping was fresh as well.   Overall, for a standard 1-1.5 hour wait on weekend brunch, I probably wouldn't go back. Neither of the dishes we had were great enough to say, ill come back just for THAT.",

Portion size was very generous and their bourbon maple syrup was good too. Would definitely come back here!",

Breakfast potatoes in Pittsburgh are usually sopping in grease, reheated, and lacking in flavor- these were the opposite! Freshly cooked heirloom potatoes served crisp and dry (no grease at all!). I've had the funky monkey, sausage and gravy, and breakfast magic. Sausage and gravy were my favorite but the other two were also delicious. People complain about the wait but if you use the No Wait app it cuts the time down significantly. Try the bourbon syrup! It's amazing! Love their teas too.",

If you are in an adventurous mood, you can try the Funky Monkey or the Breakfast Magic. If you are feeling less adventurous, they also have plenty of tamer savory or sweet options. You can also always build your own omelet.  The waitress took her time providing us suggestions, which was nice, but the number of options was a bit overwhelming at first.

I had and omelette once too, and it was okay, but wasn't anything to rave about like the waffles.One thing that is cool is that they have a bunch of different syrups. They have your normal maple syrup, but they also have a whiskey syrup which isn't as sweet, as well as some other options.   Just a warning, if you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour.They offer to call you when your table is ready, so if you really wanted to you could go walk around Southside Works as long as you don't venture too far away.  For as nice as a place it is I didn't expect such as \"get them in get them out attitude\". I know they get busy, but since it's a little higher end than a diner I kind of expected a little more attentiveness from the staff...but it's okay, because the waffles are so good!",

The candied walnuts and ice cream were a perfect combo to this waffle. I'm not sure if I could finish such a sweet entree but I had some good spoonfuls off his plate that did not disappoint.

Maybe it's because it was a weekday, but parking was really easy to secure on the main street.  I'd like zero hassle parking when visiting any city, so this was a nice experience.  The place is a brunch/breakfast spot where you have coffee with friends. I'd bring a few friends here in the morning if I were a local (not a huge party though). It's a quick and friendly place to eat.  I ordered the Megaberry Waffle: raspberries and blueberries inside the waffle, topped with fresh berries, vanilla bean syrup, and whipped cream. It makes for a killer picture. Also their syrups are worth noting. There are ingredients infused in these house-made syrups, so be sure to try them out. The vanilla bean syrup had actual vanilla beans in the bottle. Again, I'm impressed.  Another pat on the back for myself in choosing this place while traveling. Another good find on my long list of food spots.",

Husband ordered chicken & waffles that MANY people told us was to die for.  Average at best. No butter, salt or pepper on table.  Had to ask for them.  I ordered B.C. breakfast cause I'm a plain Jane with food, which is eggs, toast meat (I chose bacon) and 2 non meat sides (I chose home fries cause I love potatoes).  Everything was okay except the home fries were multicolored potatoes with veggies cooked in.  No butter, no jelly and ask for s&p.  Cost was $32 and it was nothing special. Oh, and coffee was lukewarm and thank God we had cash cause their card machine was down for 3 days.",

I went on a weekend so the line was long luckily I put myself on the waitlist before I got there so I was able to get seated immediately I got the country Benedict and added cheese to my waffle for an up charge. I won't lie it was very tasty especially the sausage gravy which is hard to come by in my opinion but you only get two measly quarters of a waffle and I couldn't taste any extra cheese inside the waffle maybe because it was smothered in that gravy but still I expected to at least taste it a little bit. The food is good but it can definitely get expensive if you decide to make your own creations so I'd just stick to the waffles they have or only get one or two add ins if you go.",

Lemon poppyseed waffle was incredible! Gorgeous presentation with an edible flower. Blackberry syrup,  fresh blackberries, vanilla ice cream and lemon cream cheese. The vegetable/vegetarian omelet is also amazing. Home fries are all different types of potatoes and are different colors (white, purple, orange) so the plate is beautiful :) not to mention the amazing spicy mayo on the omelet itself, which was filled with roasted tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and feta cheese. I will definitely be returning here with my next out of town guests!",

They have a lot of tables and they even have a coffee bar in the front of their store. One nice perk is that you can get on the waitlist online, so I got on the waitlist from my house and then drove over around the time our table is ready. *they will text you when you're table is ready, but can only hold it for 10 minutes after they text you!* The menu is small, but you can get jazzy by creating your own waffle combination. I got the Benny, which is basically eggs Benedict on a waffle. I was skeptical of this, but it really worked! They also make a hollandaise in house and it was delicious! They topped the Benny with crab meat and it was much appreciated! I was checking out peoples food around me and everything looked really good. I will definitely be back!",

It appeared to be kid friendly, since it was packed with families with babies and toddlers. High traffic and lots of children led to some messy floors. But overall, it was clean and I found it to be adorable inside.   The menu had options from savory to sweet....  I ordered the breakfast tacos and a caramel latte (with whipped cream of course). Both were delicious! The latte was wonderful and beautifully presented. The tacos were composed of fresh ingredients and the fresh squeezed lime gave each taco the perfect flavor. In the top 3 for best breakfast tacos I've ever had. (If you follow my reviews you know my love for breakfast tacos!!)  I will be back!",

I still recommend getting the homefries if you go here, but I knocked the stars because of the service.  Upon arrival at 1:22pm (closes at 2, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal) I felt unwelcomed by the hostess who was hesitant to seat me. I got over it and was happy to be seated but felt rushed to order. After my food came out she asked if I wanted anything and I asked for ketchup, after waiting 5 minutes she still never brought it out so I just ate without it.  While I was eating, they were closing down the shop, wiping and spraying all of the tables (around 1:40pm), and organizing the silverware for the next day at the table across from me. The only thing I wanted to do was leave! The waitress was nice to me, but she and the others were extremely inconsiderate of the guests in the restaurant (2 other couples). I will never return here just because of this experience. If you close at 2, that's when you start wiping down tables and stop seating people.",

We were given a little slip of paper saying the wait for food usually lasts a while since everything is made to order, which was a nice heads up and made the wait less of a surprise. I ordered the foster waffle and my boyfriend ordered the waffle with the egg on top (can't remember the name). Both waffles were good! I had to order a side of eggs and bacon too so that I would be full though. It wasn't bad and the waffes were good, I just don't know if I would go back right away (I like a lot of protein in my breakfast). If you're looking for something sweet though for a breakfast/brunch spot, this is your place. They have a lot of omelets I didn't get the chance to try though, definitely give those a go.",

It was practically empty when we entered. Our waitress and the manager were both very sweet and we were taken great care of.   My fiance ordered the funky monkey with espresso dust and loved it. My brother-in-law and twin both ordered the souther' with avocado and they both finished theirs so my guess is they really liked it! My sister had the fosters and it was so good and she really loved it. As for me, I tweaked the breakfast magic, adding mushrooms inside and avocado on top! Amazing. And paired with the bourbon syrup it was so crazy good!   We also ordered some of the sweet potato waffle fries and they were pretty good, too! The coffee was fresh and refilled quickly. I look forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "My experience here was so poor that I'm actually writing my first ever Yelp review.  We were seated right away (party of two) on a late Friday morning. Our food took ONE HOUR to arrive from the time we ordered. They were not slammed, at no point did the server come over to at least acknowledge the fact that the food was taking so long, and when it finally did arrive, my waffle crepes were room temperature, as was my boyfriend's waffle.   Coffee: so weak that I couldn't even drink it. Bathrooms: dirty and no soap in dispenser Food: hard to say since it wasn't served warm, but everything tasted fine. Food runner asked what kind of syrup I wanted, gave me three options, brought me the one I didn't pick. Which whatever, syrup is syrup, but it was super watery. Not good.   We were on a 3 day trip and decided to skip the complimentary breakfast for one morning to treat ourselves to a delicious brunch while staying in Pittsburgh. So annoyed that we wasted that experience at this breakfast spot.",

    "text": "Had to knock a few stars off. It's been a year since I last went, but since I was back in the Burgh for Thanksgiving holidays, I decided I had to return to get more delish waffles with my mom this time.   We decided to go on my birthday this year, and it wasn't really crowded since it was a Monday afternoon. It took a while for someone to just bring us menus and drinks. A harbinger of things to come....   We finally placed our order. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. A lot of time passed. And I was starving, mind you. Same with my mom and BF. We were all hungry asf!   Finally, totally fed up with the poor service, my mom walked over to the counter and asked wtf was going on. Apparently they totally forgotten to put our order in. And NO server came by to check up on us. It was a massive disappointment, plus my mom had to go outside and keep putting money in the parking meter thing because we had to wait so long. Really unacceptable. Kind of a shitty way to kick off one's birthday. But oh well.  They apologized, yes, and they brought us food. But that was it. No offers to even comp even the orange juice or give us some type of coupon for a second visit after making us wait for over an hour. Maybe they assumed we wouldn't bother to come back after such shitty service. But believe it or not, my mom was totally in love with the waffles, so she wants to go back, but it probably won't be for another year or so. I just hope that if we do return, the service is better and they don't have 1 person waiting on the entire restaurant, busy or not, and that they actually remember to put in our orders....grr.   I wanted to give 2 stars or less, but I agree, the waffles did come out perfectly delicious, so that was their saving grace in my book.",

The mushrooms were good, but sides are expensive and everything is a la cart here, making a full breakfast possibly $20.  The waffle was good but not great.  Nothing stood out about it.  Anyone with a waffle maker at home could make the same or better.  The best thing is the bourbon syrup, now that is amazing stuff!  Overall the food was good, not great, but I would come back.

I've heard a lot of great things about this place, and thought it would be great to take friend who was visiting Pittsburgh for the first time. He thoroughly enjoyed it :)  -Funky Monkey Waffles: I would only recommend getting this if you have a HUGE sweet tooth. The waffles themselves weren't sweet, but the added chocolate syrup and huge lump of peanut butter in the middle of my waffles definitely gave me a sugar high afterwards. I liked how they didn't incorporate anything sweet into the waffles. By adding all the sweet ingredients on top, it allowed me to control how much sweetness I wanted to add to my waffles. Highly recommended!  -Foster's: My one girlfriend ordered this and she said it was very good. Not too heavy, and just the right amount of bananas on her waffles.  -Southern Waffles: My friend from out of town ordered this and he said it was definitely for those who like savory foods. It looked and smelled incredible though - definitely ordering the next time I go!  For Coffee Lovers: Bottomless coffee for $2! Definitely a steal :)  Tip: This place doesn't take reservations, but if you have an iPhone, you can wait in line by adding your name and party through the 'No Wait' application. I did this and we were seated almost immediately once we got there. If I hadn't reserved my place in line, we would have had to wait for at least 45 minutes, so this was definitely a huge time saver!  The only con I could see was when I called to ask if they took reservations, the person on the phone was very rude and hung up on me before I finished asking my questions. My waiter however was extremely nice and helpful - so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt this time around :)",

My gripes come from other aspects of the resturant. The air conditioner was broken. We sat there in 80 degree sweaty heat as we ate a hot breakfast. It was hard to enjoy the food because the air was so stagnant and hot. They also seemed to have an over abundance of small flys swarming  around the resturant. They got a bit annoying buzzing around our face and down right discussing when they landed on my waffle!!! Rrrrrrr. I was a bit annoyed at that point. The place is a great concept and prices are good. Just wish I had a better first experience. Probably wont be back again.",

However, we waited for a good 30-35 min while there were 2-3 tables just sitting there waiting to be cleared off.   Once we were seated and ordered the wait continued. We didn't see our waiter again. I'm not sure if he was hiding in the back or what but I had to ask another server for a coffee refill (they use mini coffee cups).  Food took forever to get to our table. Once it arrives, my wife's was cold to the touch. Sent it back and waited even longer for a replacement.   Food isn't bad but a lazy restaurant. Look at other reviews and you'll see that staff and times are just slow.   Go down the street to Double Wide Grill for a nice Sunday brunch.",

    "text": "I fail to understand the apparent fascination with this establishment.  I have been to WI on three separate occasions (being that I live a stone's throw away), and each time I have come away dissatisfied and wondering why I bothered in the first place.  They do not allow substitutions on their BC Breakfast, so I hope you like tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms as your sides with eggs and toast.  The omelettes are OK, if small - the hashbrowns are also decent, but were undercooked.  Purple potatoes are not that impressive if they aren't prepared properly.  On my last (and final) visit, I got Breakfast Magic, which had the potential to be at least a good (if not great) dish, if it weren't for that fact that the egg to waffle ratio was way off.  I need more than one yolk to help add some moisture to a dry and salty dish.  The coffee is worse than what I make at home and is served in a cup approximately the size of a thimble, which means that you are going to need it refilled about 3-4 times during a normal meal.  The service is acceptable and the decor is fine - they must have had a huge sale on the color green.  But none of these things make up for the fact that the food is overpriced and, despite their create your own omelette/waffle menu, very limited in choice.  On all three occasions my wife got various types of waffles (the last being the seasonal pumpkin/fig/cranberry monstrosity), and each time she was very disappointed in the meal.  There are better breakfast choices in Southside and the surrounding areas.",

    "text": "I suppose I'll deliver the good news first, the food at this establishment was delicious and I would recommend the food to anyone. However, this was honestly the worst dining experience I've ever had, I don't even know where to begin.   For starters, we weren't greeted at our table. Instead the waitress slung water at us in a hurry and ran off. I get it. Both my dining partner and I are part of the service industry and can understand what its like to be busy, however in any establishment you expect  at least a hello or welcome. Fine, we decide to choose our breakfast quickly so we can give our busy waitress the order. She comes back to our table 10 minutes later and we tell her we're ready to order, to which she responds she'll come back when SHE is ready because she has other tables to tend to. K den. We wait as she takes two other tables' orders and puts them into the computer, another 10/15 minutes. Finally we order an omelet and a waffle to share, wahoo, we were super hungry.   20 minutes...30 minutes... 45 minutes... People who sat 10-15 minutes after us are getting their food and we're waiting. The waitress was nowhere in site, tables around us sat dirty while people lined up at the host stand. (This didn't directly affect us but again, as people in the industry we take notice of such. No wonder it takes them so long to seat their wait list). Finally after waiting for 45 minutes for our food, our waitress returned to the table and said \"Wait, what did you guys order? Cause the printer jammed and we lost the ticket.\"  Such a sad story, apparently said printer only \"jammed\" for our order as everyone around us enjoyed their meals. At this point, we were ready to leave but instead repeated our order. No apology from our server, a manager, anybody. This experience could've been handled SO much more professionally. Blaming the kitchen and the \"printer\" for crappy, slow service is just completely unprofessional. Another 20 minutes go by and we get our food, but have no silverware to enjoy it with (also something we noticed at every table around us, everyone had to flag down their server to ask for cutlery, this is a restaurant!!). The food was good, but at this point we would've eaten anything after waiting close to 90 minutes from host stand to meal.  What really frustrated both of us wasn't the experience in total but that nobody offered us an apology, an opportunity to speak to a manager, nothing. This was a one-hit failure for both of us and we will never go back. 10/10 would never recommend unless you eat a full size Thanksgiving meal to hold you over for 90 minutes while the service staff runs around \"jamming printers.\"",

We stood at the door while we heard the servers stated they had to clean some tables, as one was walking back to the kitchen she had a mouthful of food and decided to check her phone instead of address customers.. After being seated , we were greeted and our orders taken but everyone was getting their food and refills before we even got our food( one waffle and an omelette). After sitting there for 35 minutes I started getting annoyed because it's never been slow like this here, even on a busy morning. Servers were too busy joking and on phones and forgot the fact that customer service is important especially since I also work in the service industry. Just overall disappointed in the visit .

    "text": "I think this place needs some kind of intervention.   The term 'sui generis' is on the menu,  not just once, but TWICE.  In case you don't know Latin, which most people don't, it means \"of its own kind\" - I had to look it up, too.  Yelp helped me find this place, so I'm returning the favor.  Other Sunday brunch times, we've driven past and saw a line out the door.  It wasn't out the door today and that's good because it's chilly out.  When we got inside, the host's back was to us, because we were instructed to go in through a side door, which I assume is meant to keep people from gathering near tables, but it's just not welcoming to walk into a place where the person I'm supposed to interface with has his back turned to me. Gratuitous technology in restaurants also can drive me nuts.  There was a wait and I was offered to receive a text message when our table was ready.  Red flag for two reasons: I'm going to bet that goes into a database somewhere, and where am I supposed to go to wait? Across the street for some hookah?  Maybe this would be fine in warmer weather, but it also seems like a great way to lose a sale by causing people to wait elsewhere.  I ordered the signature savory waffle, the one with bacon, green onions, cheddar cheese and a fried egg.  It was GREAT.  I really enjoyed it, it was something different, tasty, and I was able to finish the portion.  The egg was also cooked to order well, something I consider to be hard to do, especially during a busy period.  My dining partner had a plain waffle and enjoyed that, and we both liked the sides of ham and home fries (many additional points for using a medley of potatoes, which was colorful and tasty!).  The presentation was lovely, too.  Overall, the food is good and shows a commitment to high quality product.    So it's too bad that we had a ridiculously long wait for our food on during a brunch service that wasn't even particularly busy.  And then the hair my dining partner found on her plate?  Unacceptable.  First, we were offered a 20% discount, then our whole meal was comped because the waitstaff were so frustrated with the kitchen.    That's where the intervention comes in.  Management, leave the cooking to the professionals, and STAY OUT of the kitchen (maybe even the restaurant - watch what goes on through the fancy POS system and iPads everywhere) -- otherwise, you're going to continue to hemorrhage money when you have to give discounts or comps.  If you want to stay in the kitchen, there's probably always prep work and cleaning to be done.  Or focus on finding ways to improve the people flow so that I don't walk in to the host's back.  It's hard to say if I'd return or not - because while I really enjoyed my meal, I don't know if the food was good enough for me to be patient and tolerant of the obvious management issues next time.",

Here was this giant plate with a little waffle and a couple of chicken tenders on it. The french toast was the same. The waffle was ok at best, nothing great by any means, and the few chicken tenders were fried well and tasted ok. The French toast was absolutely bland. The accompanying topping helped, but there definitely wasn't enough of it. After being about half way finished the waitress offered some of there flavored syrups. I wish we had known about them earlier as they did help add a little flavor. We went with the bourbon syrup and it made it easier to finish the meal.

We selected the \"make your own waffles\" and waited 30+ minutes for them to get to the table. They weren't very hot which was a bummer. Omelet was ok. Got the meat lovers. They don't skimp on the meat. But again, it wasn't anything to write home about.   Great place for kids to go sugar crazy happy with all the waffle toppings and mix ins. Just be prepared for a wait.",

It was a lot though and I should have just split one waffle with my sister in law who ordered the same thing. Either way, it tasted amazing. Oh, and the coffee gets a thumbs up as well.   It's kind of a small place, so use their reservation app. I'm from Cleveland, but the app seems to be used in most Pittsburgh restaurants so it's worth a download if you're in the area.",

However, by the time I found it and parked, there was a 45 minute wait for parties of 2 or more, on this Saturday.  But yay, I was a single!!  Seated at a tiny table in the back which was fine - restaurant was small and busy.  My waitress, while not cheery or talkative (again, fine) - was responsive and prompt.  She realized I was trying to get in an out and made sure not to ignore the sad little one-top.    So I wanted to try this place, but admitedly I'm not a major waffle fan.  These waffles though, they're an A+.  They're not just plain waffle, but have flavor.  I ended up getting the Benny and the hollandaise was technically correct (no separation, tasted good) and the crab meat was cleaned well.  My food did come out a little cold, but that may have just been the general temp of the restaurant and the fact that there weren't really any cooked items besides the waffle (poached eggs loose heat quickly).    Breakfast for one under $10, before tip.  Definitely use the NoWait app as the waiting area is extremely small.  Overall, give it a shot - they've got some great menu items!",

To be honest, it was utterly disappointing. I felt like I waste my time here.  Wait time: Seated within 5-10 minutes of arrival, but the wait time for the food is about 45 minutes - 1 hour (not worth it).   Service: The waitress barely checked up on us. Came by with the food, and only one time for water.   Main dish: When I got my food, I expected it to be at least warm. I got the Benny, and the entire dish was cold. The waffles were NOT crispy. They were actually soggy. The poached eggs were overcooked, the hollandaise was bland, and the crab tasted like it came out of a can. If your restaurant's name has the word \"waffles\" in it, the waffles should be amazing. If you want real waffles that are crispy on the outside, soft in the inside, this is NOT the place.  Drinks: Only had water.   Cost: $10 for a measly HALF of a waffle (not even a whole one) with 2 overcooked poached eggs.   Ambience: Casual, family- and group-friendly.   Overall: Really disappointing food, disappointing service, overall disappointing experience.",

Coffee was ordered all around, and our party of four placed orders for the benedict, gyro, berry waffle, and a customized omelet of ham, cheddar, and mushrooms.  And then we waited. One cup of coffee down (add a shot of gingerbread....so good!), a Yelp check-in, and a few checks on the Facebook feed later, and we were still waiting.  And we kept waiting! The place was busy, but our eyes were jealous seeing plates go to other tables. And we were starving. This was not helping. Guess we'll talk about how hungry we are!  30 minutes went by, and we finally got our meals. While others enjoyed their meal, I was slightly disappointed. My eggs benedict with crab sounded awesome on the menu, and I was expecting some sides or just a mountain of poached eggs over two large waffles. My dish was half the size I was expecting! I left hungry, and I was pretty sad. And waiting for the check took some time, too.  I will say that the berry waffle looked pretty amazing, so if you're willing to wait, I'd come here. I was just way too hungry to wait 30 minutes. You could get an oil change, an express mani or pedi, or write several Yelp reviews in that amount of time!",

Why is that important bit of information on your webpage? Or Facebook page? Along with that we were told by them that they used the no wait app. When checked it said wait time was 15-20 minutes. When I went in average wait for under 4 was 45-90 minutes! Thanks for sending us to a different restaurant where we had a better meal and service, I'm sure!

Chicken and waffles was tasty very tasty and a huge portion. Half decent prices I guess but I think I expected so much more. The wait for the table is expected I guess but once we ordered it was 40 minutes for our food. I think it's way too long especially since the place only holds about 50 people max.

    "text": "The GF and I had just flow in for a 4th of July weekend in Pittsburgh. We stopped by our friend's place in Southside and decided to grab some brunch before exploring what the Steel City had to offer.  He recommended Waffles Incaffeinated and judging by the long wait, it's a popular place. We played some pool nearby and got a text an hour and a half later once our table was ready. Luckily, once seated, the food came out fairly quickly.   Mushroom Chevre O-My-Lette [$8.95] Fresh goat cheese, tender wild mushrooms    The GF went with the goat cheese and mushroom omelet, which was perfectly cooked and had earthy mushrooms interspersed throughout. Plenty of salty goat cheese topped the omelet, with a roasted tomato slice on the side. A nice variety of fresh fruit was provided as well.  Breakfast Magic [$8.65] Crisp bacon, shredded cheddar, green onion, egg, sour cream, bourbon maple syrup  I went with the breakfast magic, with an over easy egg. Cute Pac-Man arrangement, but frankly I would have enjoyed the extra quarter wedge since for me, this was a small portion. Some home fries seemed warranted and would have been proportionate to the price.  Still, the meaty bits of bacon, the sharp cheddar, and the bite of the green onions balanced nicely with the light, yet somewhat crisp waffle. Do ask for the bourbon maple syrup, which brought some additional sweetness to each bite, with an undertone of the whiskey.  Overall, Waffles Incaffeinated satiated my appetite for a few hours and paved the way for me to go to Primanti Brothers shortly thereafter. I can see why it's a neighborhood favorite as it features fresh, well-executed breakfast dishes.",

Waffle was good though. While we were waiting for a table, after the fact, I remembered seeing someone who ordered the chicken and waffles, had eaten the whole waffle and cut up and left the chicken when they were sone. His must have been over done, too.  The other person at the table got sausage gravy (was good but bland), toast, and tri-colored home fries (liked very much). He liked those food items, but after waiting so long it was hardly worth it.  Different flavored syrups were good.  Dear Waffles, please reevaluate the way you cook your chicken and I may think about coming back.  If I wasn't so hungry I would have sent it back and got something different.  Maybe it was an off day, for the food AND service, but this is what happened when we were here. :(",

Based on the reviews I had to try the Benny - love eggs benedict with crab!  Sadly, the reviews were right and it was not hot.  The waffle was lukewarm, ham was hot, but the crab was cold.  Eggs were made perfectly.  Friend ordered the Sausage Gravy waffle - looked good and she said it was ok.  My husband just went with a plain waffle (he's a no frill kind of guy). Reviews again were accurate in saying the syrup was very thin.  Like water.  Soaked into the waffle and made it instantly soggy.  Everything tasted ok and other things looked great, but probably won't go back any time soon.",

My son loves waffles so we decided to give it another chance and the food/service was all great!! In addition, the no wait app participation really helps.  My husband had a very large omelet and a waffle. My sister and I split a chunky monkey waffle and the breakfast tacos, and my son made his own waffles.   Sidebar, though it did not happen to us be careful with the make your own waffles, as they do charge per item in the waffle.  Overall it was a really good experience. Street parking is free on the weekends, the no wait app made it easy to get a table, the service and food were both really good.   Though I had avoided this place for a while, I will definitely be headed back!!",

My main issue was the total disregard the employees treated customers who were waiting with. They walked by us (and everyone behind us) and blatantly ignored us.   One staff member said she'd go check with whoever took our name over the phone and never came back. We stood there for 15 min as multiple employees walked by, not even acknowledging us.   I worked in the restaurant industry for years and know this is a huge no-no. You ALWAYS acknowledge guests. Even something like \"is someone helping you guys?\" Or \"someone will be right out w you\" is what should be done.   It was abhorrent and the waitlist tech update had nothing to do with it.",

It took our server 15 minutes to even approach us for drinks upon arrival.  She never checked back for refills while we tried to wait for our food.  None of the other customers in the restaurant were pleased with the service.  Many people including us requested to speak to a manager.  Upon speaking to him he simply apologized and made an excuse for the kitchen being backed up.  The manager did not assist the servers nor did he seem to know how to handle managing a restaurant.  The wait staff seemed very frazzled and overwhelmed for such a small restaurant.  Essentially the staff seemed untrained and unable to handle their small section of tables.  We told them we would like to cancel our order and left to go to another breakfast restaurant.  We never had a chance to try the food so I cannot comment on the quality.  However, the menu was very limited if you do not like waffles.  It also was over priced with most breakfast entrees costing $9-$11 and not having large portions from what we could observe from the few tables who were fortunate enough to have received their food after the very long wait.  Overall, we will never go back to this establishment and we would not recommend it to any friends or family in the future.",

It was kind of a long a wait (a little over an hour) but that was to be expected on a Sunday for brunch. Luckily, we were able to use the NoWait app to save us a place in line. If you don't have the app, I'd highly recommend it.   ****Just a note: as of 5/23/16, the prices listed on Yelp are incorrect. In case anyone is worried about prices before they go, it's mostly just a dollar more expensive on everything, sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less.   While Waffles Incaffeinated is a little expensive, I definitely think it was worth it. I got the monthly special for May, Raspberry Foray, and it was delicious. I was slightly bummed I didn't get the advertised edible orchid, but unfortunately they had ran out.   The employees were helpful and efficient. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals, and we definitely plan on visiting again! If you love waffles and breakfast food, then you need to try this place at least once.",

Well I did  just that at Waffles INcaffeinated this morning because I was completely blown away by their Waffle-Copia.  My daughter ordered it too and she was raving right there with me!  The Waffle-Copia was a special that I hadn't even intended to order until I saw the specials flyer - I had it down to 3 choices before we sat down because their regular menu is loaded with killer choices. But when you're offering up an apple & fig compote over a sweet potato waffle infused with cranberries and candied walnuts with a pumpkin cream glaze how could I not??? One taste let me know I'd made a stellar decision. The sweet potato waffle was the best ever & there were enough of those delightful figs for every bite.   My daughter-in- law's Fosters waffles with bananas, walnuts & ice cream were amazing. Hubby's spicy Souther' was crazy good, especially after he added the Bourbon Maple Syrup to it. I'd order a plain waffle and drown it in that syrup with a huge smile on my face. The coffee was a yummy dark roast, which we loved.  We all made comments that their plates were so big they wouldn't fit in any if our dishwashers so be prepared to leave with a full belly! You might even consider wearing your sweatpants here just to be safe.   We've been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a while thanks to our Yelp buddies and I'm soooo glad we did!",

    "text": "Solid brunch spot for those who adore waffles like I do. They have ample savory and sweet options plus a good location (near South Side Works) with outdoor street-side seating. Definitely tougher to get a seat on Sunday morning but nothing the No Wait App can't fix. All-in-all, a solid brunch spot for a small group but a little skimpy on the portions.   Food: I'll start here since this was the star of the show. Two words: Funky Monkey. I've got a killer sweet tooth and this one did the trick to appease it. Milk chocolate chips stuffed in the center with a very rich and not overly-nutty peanut butter chiffon. Big fan of the bourbon syrup too. I would die a happy man if that was my last meal. My only criticism was the portion- $9 isn't outrageous and for someone who eats small portions, I was fine. But it's subpar for Pittsburgh standards. Definitely not your Deluca's. A few others at the table had the savory ones and the chorizo stuffed waffle was a favorite.   Drinks: Being in Pittsburgh, when places offer local goods, it makes me happy. Coffee roasted in Beaver Falls- good stuff.    Ambience: I can't speak much to inside but outdoor seating was a nice find. It's street side so it isn't that glorious but when the weather is nice, it's a rarity to find in Pittsburgh.   Service: Our waiter spilled water and coffee twice but he just struck me as a clumsy guy. Otherwise he was very responsive and friendly- no complaints at all there.",

    "text": "Not going to lie I was a bit nervous to try Waffles Incaffeinated,  because of the weekend reviews, but oh my heavens!  I was a bit nervous at first because the hostess, was very sweet and nice, but didn't seem to know what she was doing.. But sat outside, with no wait! Once we ordered we waited about 30 minutes for our food, but considering everything is made to order and most of it is custom you have to understand, there is going to be a wait.  Let me just also say it's been 2+ years since I've had a waffle due to a severe gluten allergy discovery, holy crap it was worth the wait, the GF waffles here are fantastic ! You can't even tell. So light and fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside, the whipped cream was fantastic. I did not have vanilla syrup I had the maple, and I was not disappointed! My sister had the chicken and waffles and very much enjoyed! Our men liked the sausage gravy waffles!  And I can't help myself, I'm ALWAYS judgemental over breakfast service when it comes to my coffee, it was NEVER EMPTY, so thank you Kaitlyn!. Great experience and great company!  Come EARLY on the weekend, got here 9:50am and no wait.. Within 20 minutes it was an hour + wait!",

    "text": "Very cold Sunday morning visit today, both outside and inside restaurant. We were a party of 4 and arrived early in the day. We waited just a minute or two before being seated. We sat at a 4 top by the hostess stand. Horrible spot on a cold day. There are doors that are locked by the hostess stand, but there was so much cold air pouring in between the locked doors and under the doors. Are four of us were frozen and left our coats on the entire time in the restaurant.  I have been wanting to try one of the locations for quite some time and finally got my opportunity this morning. My wife liked her breakfast combo that she had. My son and I each had the chicken and waffles. We both liked the chicken a lot but the waffles not so much.  My son only would eat one bite of his. My daughter ordered the kids waffles with strawberries and Nutella. She enjoyed her sausage patty but absolutely hated her waffle. She ended up just eating her strawberries and Nutella. Then we were charged with a drink that we never ordered. I only noticed it after paying the bill. When I noticed we had paid and there was a big line of people eyeing our table. It wasn't worth the time to ask for my $2 back.  I'm sad it wasn't all that I had hoped it would be.",

    "text": "The food is great. Everything else? Not so much.  I will say that I've really enjoyed the food both times I've been here. The first time, I was with a group of 4 and it took 45 minutes for our meal to come. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because- hey- it's a busy weekend morning and there were 4 of us. And the food was awesome, so I wanted to go back.  Went back today with one friend. We ordered two omelets and their special waffle to share. We had been waiting 30 minutes to get a seat (highly recommend the NoWait app to get in line before you arrive), so we ordered almost immediately after sitting down because we had time to look at the menu. 45 minutes after we got our table, we started feeling hangry as we watched the tables around us (who had been seated after us) get their food. We asked our server for a status update, and she said that omelets just take longer than waffles and they should be out soon.  We hit the one hour mark, and we watched omelets get served to a couple across the restaurant who had arrived after us.  Don't get me wrong- our server was nice and great through the whole shitty process. You just reach a point where you are so hungry that you can't really enjoy your food. They took about half off our bill, and that was nice. But they forgot to return my friend's card (which we of course didn't realize until we drove back across town).   Ultimately, the great food doesn't make up for subpar service I've had both times I've been here. Would recommend you find somewhere else to go.",

We had quite a wait in spite of calling ahead, but it was a holiday weekend and we were a larger party, so fair enough. However, once we were seated and our orders were taken were when the problems began--not enough cutlery for everyone at the table, taking forever for our drinks to come out, no sugar, milk or spoons for our tea and coffee and then when they were requested, taking so long to come out that our hot drinks went cold, several of our orders were incorrect, and three parts of our order were missing altogether. The table next to us ordered after us, but our food didn't start to come out until 20 minutes after theirs. Rather than apologizing for the oversights and mistakes, our requests to rectify the problems were met with huffs from the waitstaff. We also overheard similar issues at nearby tables and several checks were not rung up correctly. This is all a shame because the food was quite tasty (I can't comment on the coffee because mine was cold) and the place is very cozy. At least they took our drinks off the bill. With a bit more training for the staff on the basics of good service, this could be a four or five star spot.",

I expected a whole waffle but it only came with half a waffle. One egg on each quarter which were very small quarters. The eggs on top are not poached eggs, which eggs benedict is supposed to have. The egg yolk was pretty much hard and it was almost like a boiled egg. My friend complained to the waitress. She explained that it was cooked like that for safety reasons which is ridiculous. I guess they don't serve sunny-side up eggs then? She was nice enough to bring another 2 eggs. They yolk was a little bit more runny but not that much better.  I also tried the Waffle Gyro. The waffle itself was really thin, almost like a crepe. It was a decent gyro, a little skimpy on the meat, lettuce, tomato, but the idea of it was interesting. The waffle-crepe itself was soft and buttery.  Next time I'd probably try the sweet waffles instead of the savory ones. Looking at the other tables, the sweet waffles seem huge and loaded with toppings.",

Tip to beat the wait: if you are going on Saturday or Sunday, download the \"Nowait app\", which will allow you to get in line from any where (ie while you are geting ready)!  The second time we waited 5-10 minutes (and that was in a Friday!).  The first time we went, I got the Funky Monkey.  It has chocolate inside and chocolate, bananas and a peanut butter chiffon!  So rich but so good!  My girlfriend got the Megaberry which was also fabulous.  We liked it so much that we went back during the same week!  The second time I got the Southern Waffle, which has a nice balance of hot, savory and slight sweetness.  It had jalapenos and sausage inside with Pico de gallo on top!  Their bacon was really crispy and the fruit bowel was jam packed with all kinds of fresh fruits!  My personal goal is to try all of the specialty waffles before being adventurous and creating my own (so many options for mix ins and toppings)!  I would also have to recommend a caramel vanilla cappuccino!  The atmosphere trendy, but the only down side is that some of the seating is very close making it common to get bumped into as people get up or sit down.  Seriously a must try!  It may just become your favorite breakfast spot!",

The food took forever to come out, which honestly I don't mind that much (so long as the food is good, I don't mind it taking longer to prepare, and I get that restaurants get busy). When everything came out, it was the saddest display of breakfast food I've ever seen. For a place with waffles in its name, I expected better than the soggy, flat things that came out. There was hardly any chorizo in my wife's waffle, it was pretty much flavorless, and to top it all off the plates were noticably dirty and smudged.   The chicken on my chicken and waffles was pretty good, which is the only reason I gave it a second star. Until they can get this place back to what it was, I'd recommend giving it a pass.  P.S. Oh yeah, and before somebody from the restaurant responds back with a \"did you talk to the manager,\" I'll let you know we didn't. Nobody on the staff wants to deal with that customer, god knows I don't want to be that customer, and how dare you for putting people in that position in the first place.",

It said we should get there around 11:40am, so we did. We still ended up waiting around for another 40 minutes or so. This was confusing to us because there were at least 12 other people waiting for tables but there were free, empty tables available. I assumed the host was just slow to seat people.   Once seated, a blue haired server came by to take our order. We'd had so much time to look at the menu, we already knew exactly what we wanted: 1. Coffee. With cream 2.  Breakfast magic waffle with spicy sour cream 3. Country Benedict waffle (has fried chicken, eggs, and gravy on it). This was my favorite.  4. A funky monkey dessert waffle when we were done with the first two.   The food  was so damn good! All of it!  My partner and I agreed that we actually liked our savory waffles even better than the dessert waffle!  The server asked how we wanted our eggs, and she delivered the perfect over easy and over medium eggs. We could literally tell the difference between our two egg orders when they brought them!  Ask for the vanilla syrup! Add it to your coffee! So good!  The blue haired server was so impressive. She really knew her stuff.

Moving forward I don't think I will return. There are far better places on southside with better service, and better food.",

Two of us both got two things and we didn't have any extra room on the table. We could barely fit our coffee cups on the table with us. There was also an hour wait with maybe two seats for people to sit in and wait. They automatically assume the people waiting are going to walk out and not wait there. And the waitress acted like we were interrupting her life. Every time we ordered one thing she would start to put her writing tablet back into her pocket and we would have to say no, we aren't done yet.  The food was amazing but with the service and the small area, I don't know if I'll really go out of my way to go again.",

They have gluten free waffles which is exactly what I need, but you can't taste a difference. In fact, they taste better than other waffles I've had before I was gluten free. I also suggest getting a side of their sausage if you eat meat because it helps cut through the sweetness with all of the toppings on the waffle.   Every time I've been there, the wait staff has been so nice and had gotten our food out so quickly! I seriously recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh!",

Waffles Incaffeinated is one of our favorites but we have only been to the one in Wexford until today. I was surprised it wasn't busier since we arrived at prime breakfast time on a Sunday, nevertheless we were happy to get a table immediately. Don't forget free street parking on Sundays, nice perk!   We ordered the Country Benedict and the B.L.T.(#nationalbaconday win!). My husband said the benedict was great, although he did say the amount of scallions was a little excessive lol. My BLT was perfect. A good amount of bacon, tomatoes, mixed greens and avocado with mayo. I also had the option of adding an egg to it for an extra charge. It came with a side of chips, would have preferred something different for a breakfast meal, but they are fresh and taste good so it wasn't all bad.  Definitely love this place overall, and this was the first time we tried something other than waffles! Glad to know that waffles aren't the only items they excel at.",

There was a wait when we arrived and for good reason; this place is delicious!   I got the Foster's waffle, which comes with walnuts inside and out, bananas and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top, smothered in foster's sauce. (I'm a pregnant lady on vacation -- yes I'm getting ice cream as part of my breakfast!)  This was a delight and surprisingly not too sweet. Everything balanced so well, with the waffles themselves still being the star of the show. Even the ice cream wasn't overpowering. It was a lot of food, but I still finished my plate.   My husband got the BC Breakfast, which is the breakfast combo with three eggs, choice of meat, two slices of toast, and two other non-meat sides. (Given the lack of ice cream, I don't think he got the memo that we were on vacation. Ha!)  I did steal a couple of bites of his, though. The bacon seemed over-processed, but the sauteed mushrooms I would definitely get again.   Also good to know about Waffles Incaffeinated: You can get on the waitlist before you get to the restaurant, via the Yelp app.   Avoid the 45-minute wait that we had by getting on the waitlist ahead of time.",

I wish they refilled our waters for us as time went on. Their tea selection is more varied than expected and the tea quality was relatively good. The signature latte wasn't as cute as the picture on their menu (with the cross hatch pattern) but was pretty good.  They took forever to bring the food (they were aware because the server came to apologize and reassure us about 10 mins before the food came out without us prompting)...my waffle was a little cold but everyone else at my table was satisfied with the temperature of their food. There was also no cutlery at the table; someone brought for us about 5 mins after the food...more time for the food to get colder.  I decided to go with a savoury waffle and try the Souther'...was light on the sausage (unfortunately) and extra heavy on the salsa but there was a wonderful spiciness that was mild but very present.   My husband tried the Benedict which seemed like a cross between chicken and waffles and biscuits and gravy...the gravy on his was lovely, he loved it and to be honest I was a little jealous.  This place shines in their make your own waffle. My mother in law did that and it was sort of fun picking out mix-ins and toppings. Our friend did the make your own omelette which he said was *kisses fingers*.   The place is pretty busy and the seats are a bit close quarters...I was all elbows bumping into my husband trying to eat with my knife and fork. All in all, I had an enjoyable experience despite some hangups and I may hit this place up again when I'm back in town.",

The portions are large and the options on the menu even larger. I like the variety of choices and the option to customize your own omelette.   I'm not a big waffle person so I wasn't overly eager to try a dessert waffle but they do sound and smell amazing.   I came here with a party of 4 over the Pittsburgh Marathon weekend and was happy that I requested a table through yelp 10/15 mins before arriving, if I hadn't we would have been waiting a lot longer for our table. There is a lot of seating and the wait staff are swift but there was a lot of foot traffic.   I gave this place a 3/5 because the interior isn't that great and I thought it was a bit pricey.",

Good news is it's worth the wait.  This is the perfect causal breakfast/brunch spot. Nothing fancy, good food, quick service. We found street parking right outside, but you could also park at one of the South Side Works garages and make the short walk up the street.   Start with a tea or coffee while you look over the menu - trust me it can be overwhelming! My beverage of choice is always a chai latte - I order a regular while my boyfriend has his dirty (one shot of espresso). The top half of the menu walks you through the waffle creations. If you're in the mood I promise you can't go wrong with the Banana Fosters. If you're looking for something else (yes I know, it's Waffles Incaffeinated) like omelettes or sausage, they have that too.   I settled on the Southwest Omelette - egg whites, sausage, peppers, onions with a side of toast. My boyfriend ordered the BC breakfast. If you can't decide what you want, the BC is perfect - it literally has one of everything on it. We both left full and happy.",

The waffle is supposed to be mixed with berries, but instead of a thorough mix, the raspberries were in one localized location in the waffle that ruined that spot of the waffle. There was also a very UNEXPECTED onion in one spot of my waffle. Needless to say berries and onion do not make a pleasant flavor. It ruined my appetite for the rest of the waffle.   My friend ordered bacon and the waiter tried to give it to me and we had to correct him, it was also WAY over cooked. Then the waiter put my friends bacon on my tab. My friend gave me cash to cover the bacon and I included the cash with my card to put towards the bill. The waiter kept the cash as an assumed tip and charged me the full price.

    "text": "I got the megaberry waffle, gluten free. I was very excited to see that they had a gluten free option! Even better was that you couldn't even tell it was gluten free, it had the same texture as a normal waffle.   I love berries so as soon as I saw this option, I knew I had to try it. The waffle batter had berries mixed in, and it was topped with even more fresh fruit and whipped cream. It was a bit sweet for breakfast, but very filling and overall tasted good. The raspberry puree in the waffle was a little overwhelming in spots, there was so much of it that you couldn't taste the waffle, you were basically eating straight raspberry which I didn't personally enjoy.   It is a little pricey for breakfast. I know gluten free is always a little more expensive places, but adding $2.50 to an already $11 waffle makes for a very expensive breakfast. Worth trying at least once because they do have some interesting waffle options, but not sure how often I'll be back.",

I tried the Southwestern omlet, my friend made his own omlet,  both omlets were on the small side for the price. Unfortunately the hash browns we ordered were not ready so we had to wait for them while we ate our omlets. Eventually the hash browns arrived in a large bowl,  they were good for being deep friied.  The coffee cups are too small. The presentation was very nice. For a breakfast place we waited a long time for our breakfast and they were not busy at the time. It's on the pricey side.",

    "text": "Breakfast Magic (cheddar and bacon waffle-goodness) and the Benny (poached eggs with ham and crab on a waffle) were delish! I would have preferred the crabmeat to have been served warmed as part of the sauce rather than chilled, but that's just me. Also, my first poached egg was refrigerator-cold and cooked through and hard to the touch. I understand par-cooking poached eggs, but that was one that wasn't even warmed! It was replaced ASAP with an over-easy egg that was obviously freshly prepared. Our server Jen was so genuinely nice, poised and attentive in the busy swirl of brunch! Love the contemporary interior design especially the combo of chartreuse and black/brown; it was modern and contemporary but still funky and cozy. I really liked the glassware and china choices: plain and elegant and sturdy with sleek lines. The booths and comfy chairs complement the table placement and the window treatments were simple, modern, unfussy and fresh. Good diverse music at the right level--electronica and singer- songwriter kinda vibe. The menu offered a great variety to choose from especially the balance between sweet and savory and waffle and not-waffle. Glad we Yelped \"Saturday brunch\" and saw all the great reviews!",

My husband mentioned how popular the place was and on week ends there is a line outside of their door - food is that good.  I have twins and got stuck at home. I didn't want to bother bringing the babies with me (it would be disruptive to the other patrons) and plus it was raining. I called and a man picked up - did not catch his name (jeremy, maybe?). I asked if I could put in a take out order. He hung up on me. I called again, thinking we got disconnected. He picked up again and after I asked once more about take out, he hung up on me.   If they don't do take out or if they were too busy, just say so. Hanging up on potential business does not make sense. Your food is great, but unfortunately, the people you have working for you aren't that great. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there that would still give you business, but I don't believe in continuing to spend my money at a place where it's clear that people don't mind being rude. I schedule a number of events and a large part of my job is recommending places to people - this restaurant just got taken off the list.",

I was torn between breakfast and lunch. I decided to get \"Chicken and Waffles\"  after a short wait my food arrived. I should add I did not get the pecans that were supposed to come on them.  Anywho I got the maple syrup that the waiter recommended. The waffle was light and fluffy with a nice crisp.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken.. was extremely hard.  They were the chicken strips breaded. I honestly Felt like Chevy Chase in Christmas vacation eating that burnt turkey.  Three pieces came with it. ALL three pieces were way over cooked.  I had to say something to the waitress. Her response surprising. She said \"yea we get that a lot,  most people  soak it in maple syrup to soften it up\" I'm like are you serious?  She continued \"it gets hard sitting under heat lamps,  when I have it I really gotta tear into it with a knife\" hold up?  Its chicken strips a knife shouldn't be involved. I make fried chicken strips all the time and I NEVER have that problem. This place gets two stars from me based on the \"Leather\" Chicken strips and the \"I know this and it sucks\" tude about the chicken.",

We came days after they opened, and they didn't miss a beat. Josh, one of the chefs and owners even talked with us for a bit. Our server was awesome too. This one is bigger than the New Brighton one and has really nice calming green/black decor. The food's the most important thing, and it delivers. The sausage and gravy waffle is mouthwatering as is the Funky Monkey Waffle we shared for dessert. The waffles themselves are so fluffy and good you could probably eat them with nothing on them and they'd still be delicious. Sweet or savory? Waffles Inc has them all including sandwiches and other stuff if you don't feel like waffles (everything was good at the New Brighton restaurant, so I'm sure you can't go wrong here either, but order the yummy waffles or you're crazy!).

    "text": "Visiting family in Pittsburgh and the morning we were leaving my cousin called ahead for reservations. Our table was ready minutes before our arrival and we were seated immediately. Unfortunately that's as good as it gets. Sometime after being seated our server came over and took our drink order. When she returned with coffee we wanted to say we were ready to order but didn't want to rush her. Big mistake. She never came back. She continued to wait on other tables around us  we finally informed the hostess that we were forgotten. Server then came over, no apology, but wait now she didn't have a pad to write down our order. Left, returned, took order. She came over for coffee refills but after that she was MIA. She'd slink by our table but wouldn't look at us nor did she come over to say I'm sorry, it's taking longer then expected or folks it'll be a few more minutes. So finally after an hour wait (yes, dumb on our part for even waiting), we called her over and asked how much longer? She gave us attitude. It's a 2 hour wait for food. Really? And you don't tell your customers that? She then said you should have called ahead (which we did - the no wait app) and told her so. She then said you can come back later or next week when it's not as busy. (There were a few empty tables). We told her we're leaving. Clearly she didn't give a care in the world that we were leaving. As a former server, it's quite clear that she's burned out, miserable and truly unhappy which equals \"time to find another job\". Let's all hope it's away from customers. Unfortunately I can't comment on the food since I never got any. However, worst service and server ever! Get rid of her  asap! I didn't get her name but we were there July 18, 10:30 am reservations. You don't seat folks if you don't have staff to wait on them. And especially if it's a 2 hour wait. Who the hell wants to sit and wait 2 hours for breakfast??? Never going back. Too many other options and places that want and appreciate your business. Which is exactly what we did. If I could, I'd give a negative 5 stars due to the service.",

    "text": "Waffles Incaffeinated is so unhealthy, but oh so tasty. The crown jewel of this place is, in my opinion, the white chocolate latte which is like biting into a creamy bar of white chocolate. So far, my boyfriend and I have tried the berry waffle, the funky monkey and the savory breakfast one and the savory waffle is definitely the best. I really liked the funky monkey, but the sugar rush was just too much to handle. I've noticed that they are generous with toppings on the sweet waffles, but skimp on the savory ones, so keep that in mind when ordering! I know it isn't a waffle, but I am a huge fan of the carnivore oh-my-lette (that's an omelet, in case you are wondering) and found it delicious and jam packed with meat and cheese. The breakfast potatoes that everyone seems to like so much are good, but not super amazing since they are unevenly crisped (some bits are soggy both times I've had them). Overall, Waffles Incaffeinated is a real treat if you have a hangover or are craving a greasy breakfast, but be prepared to be leisurely about your experience as there is often a wait and service is spotty. Everyone I've encountered working there is nice, but somehow we always get forgotten (especially when waiting for takeout, which can take 30-40 minutes on a weekend) and I have to ask for water/the check, etc.. Great spot, but has some room for improvement. I can make a better waffle (if we're just talking about the base) and not have to wait ages for it. The flavored syrups are a nice touch, but have an odd consistency so I stick with the classic maple syrup.",

This menu has something for everyone. The girls and I recently headed down to Waffles INC for our monthly brunch on a beautiful Saturday morning in the burgh. Southside was just starting to become busy as people slowly awoke from their alcohol induced slumber and meandered outside to start their day. For those of you who were never SS residents, it was 11 am. Waffles INC was packed! Always a good sign. We waited for about 10 minutes and we had a table.   I couldn't believe the extensive menu! Waffles with fruit, waffles with eggs, waffle sandwiches, waffle pancakes and just in case their numerous concoctions didn't spike your interest, make your own waffle! Being a sweet lover myself, I chose the waffle crepes with fruit and my usual side of bacon. As we were waiting for our meals, we watched in aww as the funky monkey was delivered to a nearby table with a quarter of a chocolate bar sticking out the top of a large scoop of ice cream. Think a deconstructed waffle cone with bananas. I almost asked to change my order right there. When our meals arrived, I was glad that I stuck with my first choice, the crepes. The waffle inspired crepes were textured and crisp. Not what you would expect from a crepe but delicious none the less. The fruit and cream filled out the dish perfectly. The girls also enjoyed their dishes the pancakes (also waffle inspired) and the eggs benedict. Overall, I can't wait for my next trip to Waffles Inc. Watch out Funky Monkey. You will be mine.",

    "text": "Overall I was really pleased.    Things that gave it four stars: -Original, delicious menu -Array of choices -Friendly staff -Cool environment -Affordable prices -1 free refill on all cafe drinks  Things that didn't give it five stars: -Outrageous wait - and I'm not meaning for a table.  They told us 15 minutes when we got there, which was fine!  The 15 minutes went by quickly, and my friends and I had already looked at the menu and decided what we wanted before we sat down.  It took awhile to get our drink order taken and we immediately ordered our food because we had been waiting already over 10 minutes once sat.  We couldn't order the potatoes because they were out so we got it replaced with toast.... One single piece of toast to replace a side order of potatoes which really didn't please me but whatever beggars can't always be choosers.  But then after 25 minutes had gone by after working our waitress came over and said the food was taking awhile because they ran out of waffle batter.  RAN OUT OF WAFFLE BATTER.... AT A PLACE WITH WAFFLE IN THE NAME?   We shrugged it off because we were having a good time just chatting about our weekend and then I noticed we had been waiting over 40 minutes for our food!  The waitress did however address the problem and said she would talk to the manager about giving us a discount without us even asking.    We spent almost two hours in there once we sat down.  We then had to remind the waitress that we needed our checks and she ran off after setting them down so we had to wave her down to get it actually paid.  I don't blame the waitress - it seemed as if they were just understaffed for the day.  Maybe they didn't anticipate memorial day being a busy morning or maybe I'm making excuses for them because the food was really good... Regardless I will go back and give it another shot.  The food was amazing, the atmosphere was cool, and the staff was overall friendly and nice.  But waiting over an hour for a waffle and omelet after a night out on the town can really put a cramp on your overall experience.",

I savored the mushroom chevre omelet and salad topped with a zingy dressing. The focus was on freshness rather than greasy and gut busting. The smaller portion sizes were a breath of fresh air-- a satisfying breakfast need not make you feel like a bloated glutton. A definite new  favorite Sunday brunch place!!!!",

We have been there maybe half a dozen times since discovering them a few months ago, and it's the same every time: amazing food, but you have to wait *forever* for it to arrive. Today we arrived at 9, no wait, we ordered pretty quickly, and it was after 10 before our food arrived. I've seen lots of kids melting down (today I saw 2 getting carried out in tears -- luckily mine are pretty patient and I bring snacks to tide them over). The servers have always been super nice. Today's even apologized for the wait and thanked us for being polite about it. I guess not everybody is.   The food: now, that's why we keep coming back. They have an enormous create-your-own list, so you can basically just get whatever you want. And it's always delicious. I usually get an omelet because their home fries are to die for.   I don't know if their kitchen is just too small or what, but the long wait time is seriously a problem.",

Mine was uniformly limp as though the iron was not as hot as it should have been. My dining companion's crepe may have been a little overcooked since it was a bit hard. The wait staff was excellent and attentive. The electronic software to manage the wait list for seating crashed while we were there so the tables were nearly empty even though arriving guests were told the wait would be an hour or so (Sunday morning). The tables quickly filled after the problem was fixed. My general impression is this is a very nice place for breakfast albeit a bit overhyped.",

When I showed up there was no wait which I was thankful for. I'm impatient and almost never stay at a place where I have to wait or can't make a reservation.   I started with a gingerbread latte which was perfect!! I will forever compare all gingerbread lattes to theirs. For my main dish I went with Breakfast Magic. It was a savory waffle with eggs bacon cheese green onions and some sour cream. I also got a side of pico de gallo. It was great. I do wish the egg would have actually been scrambled and not like an omelet with nothing on it. If I'm wanting a waffle this is a place I wouldn't mind visiting again.",

    "text": "Finding a good brunch place on Christmas Eve can be a struggle. I was with a party of 6 and to our delight, Waffles Incaffeinated was open for business and sat us right away!   The inside is a bit cramped but considering the size of the restaurant, they make the most of the space and I ain't hatin' on that! I was happy to discover that they offer a variety of coffee beverages. I asked for a decaf soy latte but they were out of decaf espresso :( I ordered decaf coffee instead but our waitress brought me a side of soy milk to use instead of half & half! Win! Our table ordered omelets, chicken and waffles, MTO waffles (gluten free and regular) and a side of breakfast potatoes. My thoughts:  Amazing: The menu variety. The food choices to mix into the waffle batter and/or add to the top is extensive. Take time to choose, it's worth it! Savory or sweet options, galore! Three types of syrup, too! Regular maple, Bourbon infused maple and Vanilla (real vanilla bean infused inside of the bottle) BONUS: Gluten free waffles! No sacrifice in taste or consistency!   Great: The Omelets and the MTO omelet option. A topping option is a huge portion of fresh avocado. Try it with a crab & veggie omelet *salivates* Also, breakfast potatoes that are a mix of sweet potato, blue potato and regular with peppers and onions. Enough said.  Just fine: The coffee. Maybe the espresso options have a better kick but I found the taste of the plain coffee just okay. I had to add the vanilla syrup with my soy milk to give it solid flavor.  Eh: The price. Specifically, the add on prices and cost to eat gluten free. You won't find diner prices here! For the price of a full meal, there are brunch spots with AYCE deals around the city that include an adult bevy! I'll reserve this joint for special occasions.   Less than eh: Service time. I get it, brunch is a busy time. But, it's no secret. We waited almost 45 min for our food. Our waitress was great and very apologetic. She refilled our coffee multiple times and was very attentive throughout the entire meal. No compensation for the wait or an apology from management. Not a deal breaker but it's nice to know that the management is communicating with the staff and aware of issues such as major food delays!   All in all: 3.5/5. I'll return on occasion.",

    "text": "Went here last week on the Friday before New Year's. A wait for 3 people was only for a few minutes, so we lucked out there. Probably because most people's work places didn't decide to have New Year's Day observed on Friday instead of Monday like mine did. But it worked out!  None of us had ever been in before, and I suggested it once I remembered that it being a Friday, The Yard would not actually be serving brunch and I had to think of an alternative. I don't know how I heard of it, but the name sticks out! And friends were met.  Service was prompt and courteous. Coffee was really good, which is kind of rare for a breakfast place in my view. I also liked the tiny coffee cups that they served it in-it allowed me to actually finish a cup for once before they came around to refill it, (thus ending the constant adjusting of cream and sugar ratio to each cup.)  I got the Breakfast Magic specialty waffle...which I was really confused about when I ordered. I thought it was just an egg breakfast? (I dunno. I read the menu really, really wrong.) and was confused but not upset when I got waffles WITH an egg on top. It also explains the befuddled look I got from our server when I asked if it came with toast or anything. (No. The answer is no, waffles do not generally also come with toast, Kate, you carbivore.)  It was really good! A plain waffle topped with bacon,cheddar cheese and green onion with an egg (cooked your way) on top. Really yummy, but I didn't see any of the toppings cooked into the waffle as advertised, just on top. Shrug. It was good and filling. The aforementioned toast was unnecessary.  Solid 4 stars. I'll be back",

But the lack of quality is evident from the waffle to the bacon to even the watery syrup that makes one consider consuming their food without it. There is zero decor or ambiance so this is certainly not a date spot for brunch. It's more like a Waffle House minus parking, or food made with a semblance of passion.",

I 100% felt the wait was worth it! You can also order to-go breakfast if you don't feel like waiting.   I chose the Benny which is half a waffle with thick Canadian bacon, a poached egg, hollandaise sauce, and lump crab meat on top. Oh. My. Goodness. I can't wait to go back! My husband had the Breakfast Magic which was a whole waffle with bacon, cheddar, and green onions, and a fried egg on top. It had sour cream on the side, and my husband added an extra fries egg and Sriracha. He said it was fantastic.   I ordered a cappuccino but was told that their coffee machine is a little wonky and that it may actually be a latte. I thought this was odd since I know the difference between the two and didn't want a latte. I went ahead with the drink anyway and enjoyed it. Service was good and everyone was pleasant. I noticed a few people were taking coffee to go although I did not do this.   I recommend giving this place a try!",

Definitely use the NoWait app if you go on a weekend or else you can have up to a two hour wait.  Husband had Breakfast Magic. He said that it was good, but egg was quite small, and it could've used more sauce.  Daughter and I shared the Funky Monkey. It was very good. The peanut butter topping was delicious. Could've used some more chocolate sauce, but we made up for that by using some of their syrup. Also had bacon, and it was delicious! Son had Fosters waffle, and it was amazing! I think it was the best order at the table. It was like dessert for breakfast since it was topped with ice cream and cinnamon.  Wait staff was friendly and efficient.

    "text": "Dear lord, the waffles eggs benedicts were life-changing. From now on, I want all my eggs benedicts to be just like Waffles Incaffeinated's. The egg was sooooooo perfectly runny, the waffles were fluffy, and the hunk of crab meat made this dish a satisfying portion. And then you pair it with some hot sauce and their amazing bourbon maple syrup? That just elevates these eggs benedicts to another level. So in love. For about $10, these were one of the best eggs benedicts I've had. Sad thing is, it doesn't come with a side. So I ordered a half order of the Funky Monkey waffles.  I'm usually not a fan of sweets for breakfast, but these waffles surprised me! Still very fluffy, just like the eggs benedicts' waffles. The portion size, chocolate drizzle, banana, and dollop of peanut butter is sweet enough to fulfill my sweet cravings, but not enough to send me into a coma. Tip: spread the peanut butter around your waffles before eating them.   Alright, to the rest of the restaurant.  You have to pay for street parking. I came on a weekday afternoon, so I was seated immediately. Waitresses were super friendly and made sure my $2 bottomless coffee stayed bottomless. On top of that, I got really great recommendations of local breweries to visit since I was touring Pittsburgh from LA.",

We chose the waffle you can top yourself. Because not all toppings are created equal, it wasn't great. But I also thought the waffle itself was not light and crispy - the texture is a denser, average waffle that you could make at home. Plus, they don't have real maple syrup and I'm a snob about that. I was, however, blown away by the home fries! The omelet was good.  When I came back this time, I ordered the mushroom and chevre omelet. The eggs were cooked with the mushroom and then filled with plenty of goat cheese. Delicious. The perfect saltiness of the home fries complemented it well. I have tried other people's waffles but I just don't think they're anything special. They're good and you can be creative with the toppings (or just choose one of their flavors), but to me, the eggs and particularly the home fries are what make this a 4-5 star restaurant.",

I had a side of the home fries with a poached egg and mushrooms on top. EXCELLENT. The egg came out and my friend commented on how it looked like a fluffy cloud.

We drove to this place but was disappointed it didn't open until 0800.  The Funky Monkey was on special at 5.00, so I ordered that and egg on the side; I asked how many eggs you get for 3.50 - you get two.  I am very specific about how I want my eggs cooked and the waiter was very nice and said they would be served that way as he too does not like gooey eggs.  So surprisingly, the eggs were cooked just as I liked them and even better than I expected (buttery and flavorful) and the waffle was really good too - although I wish I had asked for the syrup (and yes, it was offered).  Coffee refills were given and also, the coffee is good.  By the way, as it was Friday, there was no wait.  Service seemed very fast.",

Never really have had a long wait, its always been shorter than what they've told us.   Service is fast and the food is delicious!",

It took approximately 45 minutes for it to come, which in my opinion is way too long for a waffle. I was expecting a more crunchy-on-the-outside-and-fluffy-on-the-inside waffle, like a Belgian waffle, but it was plain like the waffles served in my dining hall. Not my favorite consistency. In general I would say that the experience was just okay. The wait was too long and the fire alarm went off for five minutes and the staff didn't do anything. I might go back, but not in the near future.",

We also couldn't resist the sweet potato fries ($4) with marshmallow fluff jerk sauce.   Tip: get a latte or cappuccino! they have one FREE refill!   It was PACKED on a Sunday but what else can you expect? Service was great! The host obliged my request for some coffee while we waited.  Why only 4 stars?

There was a delicious marscapone creme smear on my plate that was so good that I wanted to rub it all over my face and live like that forever. The maple syrup was a perfect compliment. It was seriously so. effin. good.  My friends were just as pleased with their meals. One got the monte cristo which she said was the best she'd ever had, and the other got...I think it was the Magic? Don't quote me on that, but I think that's what she got, and she said it was awesome.  Coffee was really good. My friend got tea and it seemed as though there was a nice selection.   Service was super friendly and prompt. We got there at 11 and the place was almost empty, but there was a wait by the time we left.  I am going back sooner rather than later and next time will try one of their savory options!",

    "text": "This is not a hoax. Waffles INC. has opened a second restaurant in South Side where a Cold Stone Creamery once stood, proclaiming victory for independent businesses over chains. I had a feeling Pittsburgh was due for one of our own, and I hope that the move brings owners Tahj, Josh, Cassandra, and Gordon much success and acclaim.   And unlike my review of the New Brighton spot, I have absolutely zero complaints about this Waffles INCaffeinated, as minor as those gripes were (I still gave 'em a 4/5). For example...  1-No slippery glass table tops could be found here (Josh, whom we spoke with after our brunch, wants to replace the tables at the one in New Brighton). The wide-open dining room (New Brighton's is a little small)  is cozily colored turtle green with black accents and even has soft, plush, yellow chairs in front. This is one for the decor dictators. I challenge them to find an issue here.   2- Waffles INC. has obviously tweaked and thus perfected their potato salad.  This time, the baby potatoes that populated the salad itself were tender without being overboiled, and that dressing, which contained expertly diced and contrastingly crunchy scallions and red bell peppers, was tangy and creamy and rich and thus was miles better than that served by Winghart's (see yesterday's diatribe on that...err... joint). As a raving potato salad fanatic and missionary (eat more tater salad, children of the earth!), I was pleased.   3-Nothing was forgotten, and the service was cheery, sociable, and effectual -- a COMPLETELY different experience from the fiasco at Winghart's just 24 hours before. Anna, you rock!  The waffles had the very same light, airy quality that I expected, but when I also had the savory waffles as opposed to simply saving them for dessert (for those not in the know, Waffles INC. also has crepes, sandwiches, omelets, and other things on their menu besides waffles) I was amazed at how nothing was lost in the translation. My duo of Eggs Benedict waffles each played the part of an English Muffin, replacing crunch with pillowy chew. Underneath the perfectly supple poached eggs that bled sunshine when lacerated (Jacque Pepin would approve) was a fat, charred, juicy slice of ham, and o'er top of it all was very REAL crabmeat (are you reading Grant Bar?) as well as the most winning hollandaise sauce I've ever eaten in a Pittsburgh restaurant. Fatty, lemony, and arriving at just the right consistency between thick and runny, someone in Pittsburgh finally hit the target...or must have called my mother for her recipe -- THIS was hollandaise sauce.   Kay ordered something I probably would not have ordered for myself and therefore would never know how delectable it can be. Hers was a Sausage and Gravy Waffle, a.k.a. Shit On A Shingle. At least two of the owners are veterans, so it shouldn't shock anyone that this would be in the menu. What's shocking is how fantastic it was. That spongy waffle soaked up the savorous gravy while the crumbled pork sausage was as saliferous and decadent as homemade corned beef hash. And what. A. Plating (pictures are coming). It was akin to stepping out of the cafeteria and into the 5 star hotel.   For dessert, Kay and I ganged up on the Funky Monkey Waffle. Mammoth enough to serve a quartet, we barely lasted against it. A ball of peanut butter chiffon (peanut butter is folded into whipped cream to keep the peanut butter from being too rich according to Josh) topped a waffle that is segmented four ways and is also garnished with chocolate sauce, banana slices (holy Elvis!), and a Hershey's chocolate bar for added opulence. I'd been making peanut butter banana sandwiches for myself for years (with bread and Eggo waffles) ever since my aunt (an Elvis fan) introduced me to the concept, but I never thought a chef would take it and turn it into something so epic and epicurean. A towering monument of triumph constructed to pay tribute to the gods of confections, we worshiped at its base. That mighty waffle, studded with chocolate chips, was merely a platform for all that sugar can be.  Our collective hunger was annihilated by Waffles INCaffeinated. The snowdome that is South Side has been shaken once again. I predict that Waffles INC. will blow up. Big.  P.S. Despite only having opened just under a week ago, the number of glitches encountered by us was nil. Waffles INC. has got their mojo in perfect workin' order.",

Once we were seated and ordered the waiter told us it would be a bit of a wait for our food because they were so slammed. I appreciated the fact he was honest. But let me say that the food was worth the wait. I ordered the Very Berry waffles and my son ordered the Breakfast Magic. We shared. I think we inhaled them. LOL. The Berry waffles were packed with berries, had berries on too, and coveted with a mountain of whipped cream. You really don't need syrup but IF you think you need some I would suggest the Vanilla. As for the Breakfast Magic-it comes out looking just like the photo. The perfect bite is waffle, plus, a tiny but of sour cream with a bit of the Bourbon Maple syrup. Too die for!  We will definitely be back!!!",

Another fave is the P-wedge: a pita grilled like a waffle, slathered in cream cheese and topped with arugula, grilled tomatoes and capicola (I think you can choose other meats though, but why would you want to?!).

    "text": "Their Waffles with Sausage Gravy are too.die.for!!!  I didnt think waffles and sausage gravy mixed, but I took a chance cause my love of gravy trumps pretty much everything (aside from Music).  It's so rich, flavorful, and full of thyme and basil.  I would shout \"YUM!\" as loud as I could in the restaurant, but I'm sure it would startle everyone as I'm super loud in general.    The coffee is adequate, the other menu items are ok.  For example, I got their multicolored potatoes/friend potatoes/whatchamacallits, and they are delicious when they make them hot and give me the Sri Racha.  You have to ask for salt and pepper, or hot sauce or ketchup in this joint, so be prepared for that.  Some of the servers are awesome, friendly and prompt, but I hope you don't have the displeasure of getting this one server who apparently can't be bothered to work or pretend that he wants customers in the restaurant.  The seating at the front could be better organized, and it's kinda cramped in place.  It it pretty clean.  It's kinda loud in here as there is no carpeting or buffering of the noise, but it does look like an upscale diner in decor.  The artwork is corny, but who cares, you haven't had your coffee by the time you get there.  I do feel the dishes are a bit overpriced, but everything is in South Side Works.  I feel it's the best breakfast place in that part of town, and there aren't many to choose from aside from the pricey place across the street or up the hill at Denise's Diner (of which I approve).    Takeaway from the above:  get the waffles with sausage gravy.  I lick the plate everytime.",

It seemed, and rightfully so, that much of their menu is Waffle centered but they offer other things  as well including other traditional breakfast items and sandwiches if your not feeling breakfast for lunch.    I had the single \"Sausage and Gravy\" Waffles with a side of the Sweet Potato Fries with the Cajun Jerk Marshmallow fluff dipping sause. The single cost you about $6.50 and as you can see in my pics is half of a rather large waffle. I assume the double is the entire Waffle which will run you about 8.   Even though everything was very good I felt like it was a little over prices. I mean $6.50 for half a waffle? I mean it was covered in Sausage Gravy, but still if it wasn't for the $4 Sweet potato fries I would have left a little hungry. I feel $6.50 for an entire waffle would be about right in my mind but I'm am a little on the cheap side.",

As if it had been sitting around for a while.  Granted, I was in a decently large group and they could have been waiting for other dishes to finish before bringing it out, but for something so wonderfully put together, I would expect it to be served in such a manner too.  This hiccup didn't stop me from giving the place a 5/5 stars.    Eat up!  Oh, and P.S. The cappuccino with Bourbon flavor shot is Devine--in my humble opinion.",

The portion size is pretty small so the plating looked a bit awkward but taste-wise, delicious and savory. The waffle tasted and felt fresh - not hard like the frozen waffles, but soft and spongy. My friend got the Breakfast Magic with Homestyle Fries on the side. She really enjoyed her meal and coffee. The restaurant is busy - we had an 1.5 hour wait and the food came out pretty slowly.

    "text": "OK place for breakfast if you have lots of time to kill and don't mind waiting. Personally, I don't think the wait is worth it.  I've been here a number of times and long waits to be seated as well as getting your food 30 + minutes after ordering is pretty common, even on days that aren't so busy. This kind of wait would be fine for fine dining, but come on this is breakfast! On weekends, expect a super long wait for a table since it's a small restaurant restaurant and a very inefficient operation.  UPDATE: at the insistence of my SO, I gave this place another chance and had yet another frustrating experience.  I figured late morning on a weekday would be a safer bet and checked the NoWait app just before I got there which stated \"No wait, come on in\"  -  then arrived to find a number of people waiting ahead of us as well as a number of empty tables.    Despite the app still saying that there was no wait, we waited for greater than 20 minutes to be seated then another 40 minutes after our order until the food arrived.  In the meantime I witnessed three obviously overworked servers who could not keep up, let alone update the NoWait app.  At one point nearly half the tables were either vacant or unbussed with several parties waiting to be seated.   When the food finally arrived it was OK, but definitely not worth the wait. Their advertisement of a bottomless cup of coffee on the menu was a joke, not once did our server have a chance to come over to offer refills, nor had I expected him too since he was running around like a maniac the entire time we were there.  I'm not sure if the kitchen is not big enough to keep up with the orders or that the kitchen is as understaffed as the dining room. I can understand a call off here or there but given my previous visits as well as what others have reported on the site, my experience today seems to be the norm.  Needless to say, I am through with this place.",

The waffles with ice cream are also popular. What I enjoy most is softy and a little crispy waffles. Also, the latte/cappuccino can be refilled once, which surprises us a lot.  I suggest that you should arrive Waffles INCaffeinated early when weekend because the line is always long. Another choice is to go there on the weekdays, which save you a lot of time. I pretty enjoy Waffles INCaffeinated and definitely go there again.",

Definitely too much for me to handle when I got this giant plate in front of me. I do wish the waffle could be a little crispier on the edges.  Wanted to order the chicken and waffle, but the chicken is grilled. Waitress mentioned they will expand that to fried chicken.

If you're going to specialize in waffles and make your customers wait that long, I'd hope they'd be out of this world. They were subpar at best. I hate leaving a bad review, but I also hate when the best meal of the day puts a damper on mine. Skip the hype and try somewhere else.

I had been excited to check this place out, but was pretty disappointed.   First, the waffle was so cold that butter didn't melt on it. Wow. The syrup, which would've been nicer warm, was so watery it soaked in within a second. I'd never seen such a thing, in fact. Not even from the cheapest of roadside diners.   Aside from all of this, the menu options seem pretty vast: both savory and sweet. I like that they offer many things, but finding a plain option (with eggs and a sweet treat) isn't easy without buying sides and making it more complicated than it should be.   \"I wish the food was as hot as the drama going on in the kitchen,\" said my partner.  It was pretty crazy hearing all of that go on (some girl complaining about her mom and police record?) Honestly, though, I'm not too disturbed by profanity or angry venting, but I wonder what others would think? The waitress was super nice and attentive, though.  We did stop there when it was slower, so I'm not sure how that factors in overall, but I definitely don't see us coming back. A shame.",

    "text": "I used to love coming here a few years ago. Food was pretty good, specials were creative and the staff was amazing. It slowly declined to the point where I stopped going. Every once in a while I would get nostalgic and give it another try. That happened this past weekend after a 6-8 month hiatus or so. What a mistake!  They don't allow parties of 6 on NoWait...which is fine. We checked in at the incompetent host stand and were told 30-45 minutes. Once 40 minutes came around, we checked in and she assured us that she knew who we were and she would text us. 20 more minutes goes by, making it an hour since we got there and checked in again only to find out she didn't have our party in the system or whatever the excuse was (incompetence mostly) so we just left. That was my final straw.  Having stood around for an hour, I was able to observe a lot. Yes, the host was awful. Yes, the servers were slow. Absolutely the food took forever, even for a party of 2. Outside tables were left not-bussed and dirty for over 25 minutes. Every once in a while someone would come by and grab one thing off of said dirty tables, but would make absolutely no effort to clear it fast so that they could get another party seated. This also happened inside. 3 2-tops next to each other were vacant for quite a while; we assumed it was for us. When that hour hit, I saw them sit a party of 2 at one end, who had gotten there way later than us.   The sad thing is I imagine their food is still decent. I like the options. But will never go back to any of their locations. Obviously the company is growing too much to care about this location. And if this location even has a manager, that person is an absolute joke. There are a lot more establishments that actually care about the customer and would gladly take your money than this train wreck of a place.",

My friend that lives in Pittsburgh said there is always a line. We were seated outside not too long after we arrived, the staff is friendly and fun. They have sweet and savory waffles and you are able to go crazy with ingredients and toppings. I had a half of a gluten free waffle, it was good ( fluffy and light) with bourbon maple syrup. The portions are good and filling. I'm glad I tried it and will most likely go back",

I'm glad I came at 1030 because there's usually a line. I can see why. It's the best urn coffee I've had in town. Friendly,  fast service. But be prepared to carb load.   The waffles are artisinal, crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside. Not the dry or soggy variety that often parade as an excuse. Chicken tenders and waffles, with added pecans are an honest homage to the southern classic. DO IT.   But if you are carb intolerant, there are still a bunch of good looking options that I saw go by. As a matter of fact, I could eat breakfast here every day.",

There were numerous empty and dirty tables. There was also food on the floor.    When we got to the waitress she gave us a very smug and also gleeful report that they had an hour wait - like she was proud of it or that I was some sort of moron because I did not call ahead.  Maybe if they were a bit more efficient at getting the tables cleaned up they could get a few more people seated.  I went to the place across the street - Cucina Vitale - and it was it was fantastic.  I am soooo glad these guys could not seat me.  Never coming back here.",

Our waitress, Rhiannon (I hope I spelled that correctly), was AMAZING. She was funny, helpful, and really made sure our experience was enjoyable.   I got the Benny waffle. It was really good except that the waffle was very buttery. Next time I go, I will make sure to order it with the vegan waffle instead. My brother and his girlfriend also loved their waffles (they live in the area so they are there all the time). They suggested we get the breakfast potatoes as well and I am very happy for it. Those potatoes were delicious.   If you are looking for good food and a nice atmosphere, I definitely suggest going here. The only thing keeping this place from being 5 stars is that we were seated right next to the bathroom and there was not a great deal of space for people to get by our table.",

It is located on E. Carson St near the corner of 25th Street in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood. It sits between the office of a State Farm Insurance agent and another restaurant called Wings Over Pittsburgh.  The entry is a little cramped but once you've cleared the server podium the floor space opens. The exterior walls have a black pattern on them while interior walls are painted a bright pea green for contrast. The floor is a light wood and all tables and chairs are made of black metal.  The wall in the back of the restaurant is decorated with three large photos of waffles and it is glorious!  Now, people don't come here for the ambiance. It does it's job and is clean and well appointed but it is nothing special. The food is what makes the restaurant.  Waffles If the name didn't tell you, Waffles Incaffeinated specializes in waffles. Leslie Knope would love it here! Actually, a friend and I had brunch here on February 13th to celebrate Galentine's Day! #ParksandRec  Anyway, the waffles are the focal point and for good reason. They have savory and they have sweet. If you want a normal plain waffle, you can get that. However, you would be doing yourself a disservice.  Savory Waffles I swear by the Chicken & Waffles.  They are so DELICIOUS! You get a plate sized waffle topped with fried chicken strips. Here is the website description: \"A Southern classic consisting of a pecan infused waffle with boneless, thick breaded, fried chicken pieces coated with a maple butter glaze and topped with scallions.\" The meal tastes as amazing as it sounds. They also provide multiple syrup options but I also go for the traditional maple (it is infused with vanilla). The waffle is the perfect texture and the flavors all complement each other so darn well.  My friends, Lindsey and Julie, love the Country Benedict and Breakfast Magic. Both of those entrees come with eggs. Here are the respective menu descriptions: \"Two waffle quarters, each topped with a piece of fried chicken, that is smothered with our house made sausage gravy, and crowned with two fried eggs any way you like them\" and \"Crisp bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and green onion on the inside topped with more bacon and cheddar cheese create the perfect resting place for a fried egg* just the way you like! garnished with green onion and a swoosh of sour cream, magical!\"  Sweet Waffles Now, years ago I would get the Funky Monkey as my meal. It was a chocolate chip waffle covered with fresh bananas and a homemade peanut butter chiffon. It was essentially a heavenly peanut butter mousse. Oh, there was chocolate sauce on top as well! So amazing but it is definitely for dessert and not brunch now. I am unsure how I was able to eat that and feel satisfied for more than an hour.  I've also had the Bananas Foster's before and again...wow. The menu reads: \"Our take on the classic! walnuts inside and out, topped with bananas and a cool mound of vanilla bean ice cream, then smothered with our foster's sauce!\"  Now, let is be known that if you want a sweet AND savory waffle, you have the option of creating your own! There are over thirty mix-in and topping options ranging from coconut to cinnamon and crab to spicy sausage.  Non-Waffles It has been a hot second since I've had anything other than a waffle as my entree but I can attest that Waffles Incaffeinated has delicious omelets as well. They are referred to as O-My-Lettes here and I know why. They are scrumptious!  The menu has five pre-designed omelettes but just as you can build your own waffle, you can create your own omlette! Seriously, even if you aren't a waffle lover you will still enjoy Waffles Incaffeinated.  I can also let you know that the side of potatoes is amazing! Perfectly crispy potatoes with green peppers and onions. Wow. I always finish mine and help my friends if they cannot finish theirs!",

While sitting here we've see the line grow out the door.  We ordered the mushroom chevre, a mushroom omelette, and a savory waffle, the breakfast magic--their supposed best seller. You'd think if they've made it so many times they've have the process down pat. The omelette... I have never in my life had so much grease sitting around an omelette, and it was egg whites! The best part of my plate was the home fries, which were multi colored and delicious. The breakfast magic was nothing but. When you see a photo on a menu, when they take time to add a photo to a menu... It's got to look somewhat like that photo!! The waffle wasn't anything special and the egg was kind of sad. and small.  Even though drinks were refilled quickly, the kitchen must have been very backed up because it took almost an hour to get our breakfast. I understand waiting at other places, but this is breakfast... More likely than not you should be in and out. I had to add more money to our car meter twice while we were here.  Also, there is only one bathroom but there has been a line almost the whole time we've been here.  Most importantly, WAY too loud for a breakfast spot -- acoustics are terrible and bounce the noise, and because the tables are so close together you hear other people's conversations word-for-word.  Generally, staff is friendly and quick to refill the small coffee cups. The waitress upon leaving did offer us a to go cup for our coffee, which was much appreciated and honestly the best part of our visit.  This place claims to be a great waffle experience in Pittsburgh, but it's closer to a Waffle House experience than most would like to admit. And you're overcharged for it.",

The staff was super apologetic for the wait time which is fantastic!  I had really high expectations because...WAFFLES!   We ordered a variety of items and it was really hard to choose because everything sounds amazing!  The portion sizes were right on with all the big breakfast places in the Burgh.  When the chicken and waffles came it didnt have anything else. No, wet component. It was dry looking. The flavor was good but not what I was expecting. The MegaBerry, on the other hand, was gorgeous and chock full of toppings. My daughter was in heaven. Which, btw, was super cool that they have half portions for kids that comes with a side. Loved that! Finally, the crab caprese omelet. The egg was dry and overcooked. I  saw some crab but didn't taste it. It was bland...I was sad.  BUT, the homefries are a must have! They have a variety of types like sweet and red. Very good! I added the vaNonea bean infused syrup on top and I loved it. I added the vaNonea bean syrup to my coffee too. I could drink the stuff!  I may try it again but go for the sandwiches or build your own waffle!",

Our server was Justin and he was great. He was friendly and attentive, which isn't always common in customer service so early in the morning.   I ordered the Country Benedict with sausage gravy on the side, which was delightful. My friend orders the BC Breakfast, which was quite large but very tasty. We also ordered the bottomless coffee with flavor shots, which is a great value for a low price and the refills even come with smaller cups for additional flavor shots.   Overall, my experience here was wonderful! The food and drinks are good prices and filling, plus the service is great. I'll definitely come again!",

I wasn't super happy with the presentation or taste of the toppings. Next time I'll probably get a plain waffle. Also- the menu was very misleading on the price. Ask before you go adding a few toppings, I think it ended up being $1.50 PER topping. We spent a stupid amount on a single waffle.",

If you love waffles, go here because they amazing and the waffles come in different ways! I got the benny, which is traditional eggs Benedict on a waffle instead of an English muffin and they add crab in top. I definitely recommend this because it was absolutely delicious. The souther' waffle also tasted amazing. The waffles are so soft. Also the eggs come with pepper seasoned on top in case you don't want that.

I woke up, put myself in line with the No Wait app. Showered, got ready, and drove to Pittsburgh from Texas and I still had to wait an hour for my table. Thats just the table, folks. Sure, Amber may as well be the sweetest waitress in the world. But when the kitchen doesn't understand the difference between an egg and a waffle, you're gonna have a bad time. In summation, I'd rather wait for a chicken to lay it's eggs and have a 3 year old prepare my meal for me than ever return to this establishment. There's a million other option people.

They have a HUGE selection of waffles and other breakfast items on the menu. The Funky Monkey and Chicken and Waffles were both delicious and filling! The other portions (specifically the Benny which my mom ordered), however, are a little on the small side. Would probably go back.",

My first impression of the decor was that it was a little tacky and felt out of place for a breakfast/lunch spot, but I got over it.   The restaurant was almost empty (it was a Monday morning) and the server was my kind of server: took our order, refilled water and coffee quickly, and didn't make mindless small talk. I ordered the Funky Monkey and home fries. Both left me satisfied and feeling somewhat gluttonous, but whatever. The home fries were a mix of Yukon gold, purple, and red potatoes dusted in a ranch powder that I could eat every day. The peanut butter chiffon on top the waffle was decadent, light, and sweet with a hint of salt. Yes, please.   Overall, I was pleased with the joint. My only complaints are the decor and music selection--it was a terrible mix of early 2000s emo and mid-2000s garage rock everyone listened to in high school. I'll go back.",

The restaurant was empty when I arrived there at 10:30am so I had my pick of where to sit.  The color scheme appealed to me. I took a liking to everything from the black bamboo textured walls to  the earthy green paint color and black wood tables and chairs through out. There was a vibrant and healthy palm tree in the rare of the restaurant that  was adorable.  The green color  Waffles INCaffeniated picked for the restaurant is literally my favorite color it's like they painted the place just for me.  I would absolutely adore having this color scheme in my home.  My one and only complaint was that my bacon was not drained of grease and did not taste anything of apple wood smoked bacon. I felt I was being a little greedy when I ordered the side of bacon. I should have said no.  Aside from that everything was great.  I took a risk eating crab for breakfast but it paid off.   I cannot wait to visit this restaurant with my boyfriend who loves waffles.   Great location , great service and mighty fine decor.",

I had an Eggs Benedict type waffle and didn't even finish it. It had crab on top of it and although I know this is probably not their fault, I bit something hard and when I pulled it out of my mouth it looked like a small rock, or a big piece of sand. My food also tasted... Off? Like I shouldn't be eating it... So I didn't. My boyfriend echoed my disappointment and described the experience as \"disappointing.\"  The only thing I can really praise is the breakfast potato side. It's a little bowl of perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked tricolored potatoes. They even have sweet potatoes mixed in.   But would I recommend eating here? Nope. Will I go back? Nope. Not even for the potatoes.   If I crave waffles I'll go to The Wafflonia.",

Once inside it was smaller than I expected, though with the tight waiting area I guess I should have expected it. The seating arrangements were just too close unless you like being on top of the people to the table to the side of you.  As for the food I got the funky monkey waffle and while it was definitely good, it wasn't something special. They had a few other items I wanted to try but maybe another time. I'd come back, but I wouldn't say it's a place I would make an extra effort to get to next time.   I'd give it a 3.5 if that was possible, but since it isn't I'll go with the four stars because the food was good.",

Waitress was abominable, manager who brought our food out looked like a methed out Albert Einstein with hair so long it nearly reached our plates. The place itself is showing major signs of neglect. Cook screams ORDER UP because the waitresses are horrible, food still cold. Poached eggs over done. Hot sauce in the hollandaise I'm assuming to mask the flavor (was never like that before).

On my most recent trip I tried their omelet, I figured I should change it up a little! I had the Southwest, which was sooooo good. A little too spicy for my liking, but this was my fault for not asking for it without the peppers. Lesson learned. :) Their homefries were probably in the top 3 I have ever had!! A wonderful mix of white, sweet and purple potatoes. They were not fried or greasy, but instead like little puffs of potato pillows. SO good!!   I'm already looking forward to my next visit!! It's also a great place to take out of town guests. The decor is nice and the meal will not disappoint!",

I had the \"Benny\" which is Eggs Benedict on top of a waffle with a BIG juicy slide of ham and sprinkled with (real!) crab meat. This may sound like an odd combo but it actually works really well!

I don't think you can find savory waffle dishes with fried chicken or egg Benedict elsewhere in Pittsburgh. The Jack Daniels maple syrup they offer for the savory waffles was wonderful too. But the waffles themselves are pathetically thin and soft and very bland tasting. I \"made my own\" waffle with pico de gallo and chedder cheese, my husband had banana and pecan. Neither of us find the texture or flavor interesting. The decor was fun and clean, service was friendly but slow. I agree with the previous reviewer this place is over-rated. A traditional diner waffle is a lot better and cheaper.",

I came here this past weekend with my visiting mother and my boyfriend. I ordered a waffle with chocolate chips mixed in and fresh blueberries and whipped cream on top. They offer 3 different syrups: maple, bourbon, and vanilla. I went with the maple. The bourbon had too strong of a bourbon taste for me and the vanilla was just alright. My bf got some type of southern-style breakfast waffle thing. I can't even remember what all was on it, but it looked delicious. They both ordered a side of home fries and, let me tell you, they were the most delicious home fries I have ever had.  So the food gets 5 stars, but so does the service! Our waitress was very friendly and on top of her game. The music playing was a mix of jazz and funk, which was pretty cool. What made it awesome was the kitchen staff singing rather loudly in the back. You would think something like that would annoy you, but it just added to the experience for us. My mom loved it and nearly choked on her Coke from laughing (she was laughing with you guys, not at you, I promise! :D).  Inexpensive and very delicious. 5 stars, go visit now! And bring me a waffle.",

    "text": "I have been going to Waffles Incaffeinated since they opened in Southside a little over a year ago. There is no denying the waffles are great. They have sweet, savory, and make your own. Offer 3 types of syrup with distinct flavors. They also offer omelets, sandwiches and some other items. I always leave on a full stomach. They have a very good atmosphere.   Most issues with the restaurant are pretty normal for a good breakfast place on a weekend. The wait time for a table is usually about 30 minutes. It also is very crowded. It is not the largest space and they squeeze in most tables as possible. This is also a difficult place to go in a group larger than 4 because they really only have 1 table that can handle that many people.  My only real complaint is although the main dishes are reasonably priced and filling, sides are very expensive. If you decide to add bacon and potatoes you are suddenly at a $15 breakfast. Good thing is that you are so full you probably won't eat again until dinner.   Even with these small issues, I love eating here and strongly suggest it.",

I noticed that when they wiped off the tables they just pushed all the food bits onto the floor and they set the menus down before the tables dried so they had the smell of cleaner.   The menu sounds amazing but it mostly falls a bit short. I ordered the fosters waffles and they were ok. I also got sweet potato waffle fries and they were nice band crispy. However the marshmallow dip that comes with them is awful. Plus it is not really something you can dip a fry into because it's so firm. I think they should reconsider this sauce. My husband ordered the blt sandwich. He thought it was fine except for the special seasoning they dusted the outside with.   Our waitress was so miserable. She seemed to disappear after the initial how is your food check and so I waited about 15 minutes to ask for syrup. After another 5 minutes, she still hadn't returned and so my husband went and asked her again.  Our clothes wreaked of grease when we left. I wish it had been a better experience but I don't think I could even give it a second chance. I would recommend hiring more competent staff and revisiting the menu options. It is a good concept but poor delivery. And I really love waffles so I'm pretty sad about the experience.",

It's not very big in the place- I can see how outdoor seating during the spring/summer helps them a lot. My sister ordered potatoes & eggs, I went with the chicken & waffles. The potatoes she ordered were beautifully presented- they use multi-color potatoes, making them a little unique. She also liked her eggs. I wasn't so impressed with my chicken & waffles. They weren't bad, but I've definitely had better chicken & waffles from places that don't have \"waffles\" in the name. I didn't even finish the entire waffle. It wasn't bad, it was just average.

We ordered the breakfast magic waffle, the souther' waffle, and the peachy keen waffle as well as an order of the sweet potato waffle fries with a side of the marshmallow fluff jerk seasoning dipping sauce.   The waffles and fries took a while to come out, but each plate that came out of the kitchen looked delicious.  When the waffles came out my egg on the souther' waffle was under cooked and the order had to be remade, but was handled quickly.   The waffle fries were perfectly crisp and not greasy at all.  The dipping sauce was a perfect sweet counterpart to the fries.   The breakfast magic waffle was chockfull of delicious bacon!  I loved it.  The peachy keen was delicious, but was even better when their homemade vanilla syrup was added to it!  Once the souther' waffle returned it was delicious!

My berry waffle was ok, but I could of made better at a hotel breakfast buffet.  The wife's crab benedict waffle was much better, but the few pieces of crab sprinkled on top of it didn't really justify the name (it must be a reoccurring theme because the table next to us asked for the manager to complain that no crab could be found nor tasted in their crab omelettes).  The one saving grace of this place was the fantastic homefries, a medley of blue, russet, sweet, and fingerling potatoes that were perfectly fried.

    "text": "I went for the first time on a Sunday. I understand Sunday brunch is a popular attraction, but already knew before going it was going to be busy. While there they did not have glasses available to provide us with drinks. The order took 45 minutes or so to get to our table, but mine took longer for the reason that another server took it and gave it to another customer. After waiting for 15 minutes for water, and 45-50 minutes for my food, i was delight to be greeted by a very delicious waffle. The food was great, but the service part of the restaurant desperately needs help.   I give this restaurant a three out of five for the horrendous service, but quality food.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for such a long time, and unfortunately I think the food was just okay. The staff was excellent and a manager even took the time to go over the menu with us. As far as the side dishes, I was thoroughly impressed with their fruit bowl and with their breakfast potatoes! The waffles themselves tasted very good, but I don't think waffles hold their heat very well so unfortunately most of our meals were lukewarm or cold. I don't know if I would've minded this so much if I had ordered one of their sweet waffles, but eating cold bacon and eggs isn't exactly ideal.",
