    "text": "After coming home from college food and wanting to throw something special as a Mother's Day gift, we decided to go out for Mexican, and reviews said El Campesino was good. I now wonder what these people were thinking when they said such a thing. The only good thing out of this place was the free chips and salsa - but even that comes at a cost if you want a refill. My mom had a salad that might as have been a soup, since it was a liquid at the bottom and had almost no lettuce. My dad and I had tacos and enchiladas, with beef that was unseasoned, and the enchiladas might as well have come out of a damp box. The portions were small, In contrast to reviews I saw here. The service was just as bad, as our waitress, if she even spoke more English than enough to take our orders, did not ask how our meal was or offer any refund at all. The atmosphere is terrible too, since I felt like I was at a Taco Bell that served alcohol. For the future, don't trust all the reviews here. The portions are small and low on flavor, and the service is minimally helpful. Taco Bell offers way more in terms of price, portion, and service. Don't settle, enjoy your meal. Stay away from this sham.",

    "text": "Ok, setting aside I'm half mexican, have traveled to mexico throughout my life, lived there for 10 years, and am a southern california native. Trying to be objective as possible this place at best is bad. My wife and I ordered the number one plate. An enchilada, a taco, and a choice of beans or rice. That's right, you choose one or the other where anyone who knows even americanized mexican restaurants offer both in an entree. Anyway we got our food and it had no appeal on the plate. Enchiladas drowned in some bland sauce and the taco was a hard shell with only lettuce and white cheese which by the way weren't even in the taco. It was as if the tacos were tossed on the plate. But here's the kicker. I'm used to mystery meat. God knows I've had my share in places like jack in the box and taco bell, but what they call ground beef was down right creepy. Really, this isn't mexican food much less americanized mex food. The service? Bare bones minimum. Oh, and the salsa that they serve with the chips I swear has to be Pace or La Victoria. The prices in the menu do not justify this crap they're serving. One star for the beer on draft I had and one more because they played  mexico lindo y querido through the speakers. Won't be back. Good luck!",

    "text": "I am so happy that I remembered about this restaurant.  Nestled in a non-descript strip mall in front of Home Depot, it is easy to just overlook this little gem.  It has all the tchotchky associated with your typical Mexican restaurant, but with some more authentic nods to their ancestry in the form of some original paintings.  Entering into the restaurant, you will notice that the dining area is L-shaped with the small leg being the bar seating and the long leg being the traditional dining area -- both sections separated by the Host's stand.    We were seated in one of the many booths that lined the wall and began to review what we wanted.  All of the servers speak English, and they make an effort to speak it but you can see that it is still somewhat difficult for them -- every now and then I would slip in some Spanish when I would see that \"What?!?\" look pop up on their face.  Seeing the cheese dip on the menu, we ordered that with flour tortillas when we ordered our drinks.  The drinks, chips and salsa, and the cheese sauce came out immediately.  HOORAY!  The cheese was WHITE!  It wasn't yellow or stringy like the cheese sauce I have received at so many Mexican restaurants I have been to recently.  THANK YOU!  We placed our order for the rest of our meal:  Chicken soup (no pico de gallo) Steak burrito with different sauce sides Steak burrito with salsa de queso Chicken quesadilla  The chips were thin, crisp and warm.  The salsa had flavor, and a good consistancy but lacked any piquancy.  The combination was wonderful in my mouth.  Adding the supple cheese sauce to my palate only made me want more.  The cheese sauce was light and saucy -- not too watery or too thick -- and had a touch of piquancy and an additional layer of flavor beyond the cheese.  As I gorged myself on the chips and cheese, the soup arrived.  I tried some but was not too fond of it.  I went back to my cheese dip.  The soup arrived and again my attention was diverted from the cheese dip.  The soup had a decent flavor to it: chicken, chicken broth, vegetables.  And it did not have that sodium laden taste that most soups have acquired over the years.    I finally decided that if I ate too many of the chips, that I wouldn't be able to finish my meal; so I left one or two chips in the basket and waited for the rest of the food to arrive.  Our quesadilla arrived with the burritos.  I was eyeing my burrito with a passion.  I had asked for several different sides of sauce to compare: green mole, red mole, and tomatillo sauce.  This, for me, is the True test of authenticity of a Mexican restaurant -- can they make a good Mexican sauce/mole.  I didn't really care for the red mole -- no surprise there, but I figured I would give it a try.  The green mole and the tomatillo sauce were both good.  The green mole was a bit thick and had a bit of a bitter flavor to it.  It was a mild mole.  The tomatillo sauce was also mild but was more tangy/acidic than it was bitter.  I truly enjoyed the sauces due to their flavor.  I experimented and mixed the two into different versions and found that different ratios only improved the flavor -- in my mind.  The steak in the burrito wasn't rubbery and had good flavor.  Add in the green sauces and I was in heaven.  I ate only half the burrito -- darn chip and cheese indulgence.   I did manage to try some of the quesadilla.  It is fairly basic in its composition: cheese, tortilla, chicken.  This is GOOD.  The flavors, while basic, were quite good -- especially with the addition of a little of their fresh-made salsa.    I am happy to have found this restaurant and will continue to return!",

One of the worst places I have eaten in a long time. The waitress was high on something or half asleep, not sure which. The chips and salsa were the token Mexican restaurant staple, to be expected. The food was slop. Camarones del diablo (spicy shrimp dish), tasted like camarones de la basura (shrimp from the trash can). Tasted like canned food. It was supposed to come with guacamole, and did not. It wasn't very spicy, as described. I'd take a hot-pocket over this food any day of the week. My stomach ached for the rest of the day after this meal. Honestly, if I lived in Robinson, I'd probably return here just to give it a second chance, due to a lack of Mexican options. Hopefully this was an uncommon experience, but I'm not going to find out. Maybe the margaritas are good? Maybe dinner service is better than the lunch service?",

Now, if you're from the south or southwest, forget trying to find authentic Mexican or texmex on pittsurgh or in the surrounding area because it just doesn't exist, no matter what any Pittsburgh yelper says. On the plus side: food was served fairly quickly, were made with the correct ingredients and had jalapenos (unlike most of the so-called \"mexican\" restaurants around here. Service was nice, average, polite...always nice qualities to have in service.  On the down-side, like I said, this doesn't even come close to the rich flavors of True Mexican food as I'm pretty sure they'd go under if they did flavor it up because Pittsburgh palets tend to be quite sensitive to bold flavors. Flan was ok but missed the mark with the sauce..could have been bolder with the sweetness. Lastly, they close at 10:30pm on a Friday. Sadly, pittburgh's demographics (average age, 55) means almost nothing stays open past 9 or 10.  I would love to see this place stay open till 2 or 3. Would be a great place to grab a late bite or hang after the clubs shut down, but, then again..average age of 55 also means bedtime by 9. Oh well, what are you gonna do...it's Pittsburgh. I'd still recommend this place as one of the best that you can find in the greater Pittsburgh area.",

The Special Combination is about $10 but comes with enough food for three people. I also really like getting just a plain bean burrito. At $3.50, it's a great lunch choice.  Chips and salsa come free with your meal and are usually pretty good. The salsa is sometimes a bit inconsistent, but that's what happens when a restaurant serves freshly made salsa.

I've seen some reviews that described it as canned sauce and oily chips, I don't know if they've since changed what they use but I think their salsa is one of the best and I've seen them make their chips fresh there. The only reason for the 4 stars is sometimes the service isn't always the greatest,  they have a tendency to speak to other workers there in Spanish (which I speak) and heard them complaining about customers.  El Campesino's is definitely worth eating at if your really hungry and craving Mexican cuisine. It's rarely packed out to the point service is terrible, and the food is made to the same consistency thar if you find something you like, you won't have to worry about it being terrible the next time you order it.",

But, like most of us who dont have the time to take a lunch trip south of the border and live in the Pittsburgh area, thankfully there is El Campesino. My girlfriend recommended this place to me as we both have a constant hankering for good Mexican, and I was pleasantly surprised. Being from California, I am very picky about my \"Mexican\" food and am glad that traditional fare has made its way to Robinson.   Try the Carne Asada Tacos or the the Chile Colorado, you will not be disappointed. The flavors are savory and have the right amount of spice. If you are feeling frisky, use some of their Habenero salsa, it will make that beef oh so right. The Queso dip is also stellar and is a great start to any meal.  Look for coupons in mailers and enjoy this little gem. Oh and if you want Tex-Mex, go to Chilis.",

    "text": "Long ago, when I lived in Monroeville, my father and I would frequent El Campesino's first location. It was before their big dreams of total Mexican dominance of the Pittsburgh restaurant market, and we felt like we were in on a secret that we only told friends and family about. The food was delicious, authentic, and the waitstaff barely spoke English, thus adding to the genuine ambiance despite the fact that except for a few sombreros and maps of Mexico on the walls, it looked like a hole in the wall diner. Then one day, we went there to eat and a big sign on the door said they were temporarily closed. Oh no, where would I get my chile rellenos fix?? What happened??? The urban legend goes that a van was pulled over in Texas, and upon searching the van, the authorities found it full of illegal immigrants who said they were going to Pittsburgh for El Campesino's. While I don't know if this story is True, it only added to the mystique of the restaurant when it reopened two weeks later.  Flash-forward to 2012, and in my opinion, El Campesino's is Pittsburgh's best Mexican restaurant. Despite having 7 locations, each restaurant seems pretty consistent when it comes to food taste and quality. At the Robinson location, the restaurant is a bright rainbow dream of turquoise, greens, and earth tones with large wood booths, Mexican chotskys on the wall, and a bar area with TVs. The food is still genuine Mexican, and the menu is filled with burritos, enchiladas, tacos, nachos, chile rellenos, chile poblanos, fajitas, and lots more. My personal favorite item on the menu is their chile rellenos, which unlike the battered and fried version you normally see, is a stuffed pepper with ground beef and creamy cheese sauce. In fact, their cheese is so good, that they could put it on anything and I'd eat it- yum. If you're really hungry, go for the Special Combination, which for $13 will comes with four plates of food- tacos, burritos, enchiladas, beans, rice, and more. I like the price point of their combination platters- I think there's like 20 different versions. If you're looking for meals, I like the Chicken Mole- you can get it in an enchilada or just chicken with Mole sauce, My new favorite is the Cincho de Mayo, which is chicken and beef on a sizzling plate with spring onions and peppers. It comes with rice and beans, tortilla, and a fired taco shell bowl filled with guacamole. At $13, it tastes awesome, is a ton of food, and I like to think of it as sticking it to the man since it's basically a fajita plate without the $17 price. After all these years, El Campesino's is still my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, and it's very cool to how far they've come from their first small location to a restaurant empire.",

It's one of my sister and I's favorite lunch spots to meet at and I especially love the one in Robinson because there's not a lot of people during lunch. I got a taco salad, and when my sister saw it she was very jealous. It was loaded and quite frankly it defeated me. I couldn't finish. The reason I could finish was because I love their salsa and I load up on their chips and salsa beforehand. Their salsa is blended restaurant style, not chunky, and I love that. I also get the cheese dip and mix the two (what else do you need!?!?) my sister got the chicken quesadillas and the lunch portion is definitely manageable. Like 3/4 the size of a regular huge one so she was able to finish. She got a mango margarita on the rocks and I got a raspberry one and I was VERY HAPPY and calm afterwards! So yummy!",

    "text": "Yikes not great Mexican food.  I decided to try this place instead of Buffalo Wild Wings to avoid a crazy crowd and maybe have something fresher than fried wings but that decision did not work out so well.  I selected a combo plate of fried cheese basically not really realizing just how much cheese was going to cover all of the items.    I do understand and expect a taquito to be fried and quesadillas are at their core, grilled cheese. But the poblano which generally brings the flavor to a dish was just drowned out by the cheese which was the root of my disappointment - the cheese itself was the lowest quality grade cheese which I liken to a Velveeta fake cheese consistency.  If you want to just have a margarita and nachos maybe, then I don't think you will be that disappointed.  I wish I had seen the prior reviews for this place but I forgot my phone in the car - there were a couple photos that would have clued me in to how low quality the food is.  I really want small businesses to succeed over chain restaurants but ya gotta at least TRY.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the staff seemed nice.",

    "text": "We stopped in to skip the traffic after an airport run.  I felt bad telling my family that this was probably the worst food I'd ever been served in a restaurant.  I didn't want to be critical as an out of town guest. But they all agreed that it wasn't too good.  I ordered a combo of beef taco, beef burrito and cheese relleno.  The beef was unseasoned and flavorless.  Remarkable really because Mexican style seasoned beef is so easy to make: add onion, garlic, Cayenne and you're basically there.  I ate both the taco and burrito but I forced them down. I had a 2nd bite of the relleno and confirmed that it was so bad that I would not eat it.  I don't even know how that is possible.  The red sauce on mom's enchiladas was not good either.  She barely ate her plate.  Different versions of the same tasteless beef.  The fresh chips and salsa we're good.  The queso appetizer was okay but they apparently topped it with pan scrapings from the carnitas pan?  Greasy and not very creative.    Dad's shrimp dish was the best tasting but here's the thing...ten minutes from the restaurant he had a bathroom emergency.  Literally pulled over, grabbed a roll of T.P. and ran for the bushes on the roadside.  A 74 year old man in the bushes blowing up!  (Photo of the bushes, see the orange shirt) Another 10 min and mom needed to stop at the eat-n-park to do the same.   Sorry to have to write this review, but people need to know and more importantly, the restaurant owner needs to know.  Basic family style Mexican is easy food to make but El Campisino is not pulling it off.",

I was even more hopeful when that mortar full of chunky, ideally lemon-tinged guacamole came out along with a batch of oily, brittle tortilla chips.   The salsa, which I all but totally ignored, tasted to have originated from a economy-sized aluminum can pulled from a Big Lots shelf. Lifeless, it merely smacked of watery Ragu and a packet of salad seasoning.   My burrito, properly fat, was stuffed with ground beef that apparently was \"filled out\" by ground turkey. I've had ground turkey. I know how grainy it can be. I know its flavor. It isn't nauseating by any means, but damn it...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Duvyc-CiLZxQ&s=5bc222150737b949bd4c0c3f0a96b47b25e48452584e495fb59063755a8c266d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=uvyc...</a>  Why I ordered churros for dessert, I can't explain. Perhaps I thought that maybe there was a chance they'd be made on the premises, but they were too uniform, too pristine, too cryogenic. I kept wondering which convenience store I could get them from, that apple filling recalling The Clown or Tiny Deborah In The Cellophane Dress.   Each dish was plated gorgeously, however.   Many of these Mexican places keep popping up in the suburbs of Western Pennsylvania of late, and I can't help but suspect that they are all part of a chain that's trying to hide the fact that it is a many-tentacled chain. The menus are the same. The food's the same. Only the names differ.   Strange. Unsatisfying. Next!",

You are right - I had the soft shell Chicken Chimichanga (who knew)??? I know had just described every Mexican Meal on earth that deals with chicken.

    "text": "I love reading reviews of others that say \"not authentic Mexican food\" and that you should go somewhere else in the city. News flash geniuses, the only place to get authentic Mexican food, is MEXICO!   This is a great American-Mexican restaurant. It's away from the city and tucked away from the traffic in Robinson. I have gone there on Saturday evenings and it's been mildly busy. Only once was it packed but the servers are all friendly.   They have a large menu which I see people complain about the servers not knowing the menu. So again geniuses, Mexican is probably the most simple food out there. The menu is not complicated, they have a lot of combos is all.   On top of it all, the food is great, and the place is CLEAN!",

Ordered the fajitas, it was 90% veggies and 10% meat, I didn't like that. The food overall just wasn't the best I had. Ive been to better places with a better atmosphere, friendlier people.",

However, management must have changed as the service is extremely slow (hence one less star). Don't be in a rush, if you decide to come here. Relax and have some margaritas.",

When she said something  the waitress snatched the plate off the table and said it was because they changed the oil so they would not be brown.... when the replacement arrived all of the condiments were piled on top... not cool",
