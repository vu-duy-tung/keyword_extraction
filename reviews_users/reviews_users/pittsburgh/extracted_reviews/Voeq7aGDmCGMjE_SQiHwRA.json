He had to flag them down for any request, found this strange. Ordered the Chorizo chili...No...We are out of that.  OK, back to the drawing board on what to order.  We decided to start with some chips and salsa.  Enjoyed the chips and salsa, not as salty as many places. Ordered the Cochinita Pibil and the Short Rib taco.  Both were very good but a bit on the small side, smallest I have seen at a restaurant or street stand.  The tacos were very good.  Liked both.  The short rib was my favorite.",

Bakersfield is more of a fancy-modern restaurant with an Americanized twist to their food. I was in town for the weekend and read great reviews for this place so I stopped by to try it out. The tacos I ordered were delicious no doubt, just small and pricey (~$4/taco). This restaurant has a great atmosphere though, nice lighting and decor and really cool bar. My advice is that if you're looking for good bang-for-your-buck food, go elsewhere. If you just want finger food while enjoying company, Bakersfield is the way to go.",

We were here for happy hour and a large group -- 10 of us.  The drink prices were cheap and there was a whiskey special of some kind.   They also have a deal for large groups -- they bring you a sampling of basically the entire menu. Now, when this usually happens, there's never enough food for everyone and you feel bad taking two of something.  We stuffed ourselves and had leftovers that we split to take home. If you're here with a large party, I highly recommend it rather than ordering apps and separate meals.  Parking downtown can be a nightmare ... especially if there is any type of sporting event or a busy night in the cultural district. If you're driving, be sure to use the Park PGH app to see what garages are open before you get into town.",

I first ate at a Bakersfield in Cincinnati, and I did not connect the dots that it was the same place until I was actually in the Pittsburgh one. And I got way too excited. The black bean dip and queso is phenomenal. I can eat that stuff all day. The margaritas are refreshing and have just the right amount of alcohol. And I cannot get enough of the Milanesa torta - I got it on a whim in Cincy, and I have been obsessed ever since. It is the right combo of sweet and salty, crunchy chicken with a the soft bread. I am making myself hungry just thinking about it right now. I was surprised that there was barely any wait at the Penn Ave location - no complaints on my part because it meant that I didn't have to wait as long. But at the one in Cincy, we had to wait for more than 2 hours to get a seat.   Also, there is a bar in the basement, which is great if you want to get a drink where there is a little more room to spread out. Also, on the downside, I wish they made its NoWait app available to the public and just not the hostesses to put names in. Not enough to take away a star though.",

All of the tacos were really fresh, refreshing, and flavorful. The corn tortillas did get a bit soggy if that bothers you, but it didn't detract too much for me. My SO really enjoyed his short rib tostada although it wasn't my fav (it's kind of like BBQ pulled pork but a little tougher to chew if you're into that). If I were to go again, I'd go for just the bistec (LOVE the flavoring of the meat) and maybe fish tacos. And I'd definitely try the guac and queso everyone is talking about.  Everything is relative, right? This place might be a 3.3 star review if placed in San Diego, but in Pittsburgh it's closer to a 4.3 :)",

The only drawback is how incredibly loud it gets, especially in the downstairs bar. Last time my date & I ended up just not talking while we ate because it was so difficult to hear. I think this would be helped a bit if the music were lowered a bit and the majority of the volume was from conversation. But it doesn't prevent me from going because the tacos really are so great. Whenever I call for a reservation I'm told they don't take them, but I do know they let you track your place on the list via Yelp, so maybe there's an option for a call-ahead spot of some sort (like NoWait).

I didn't care for the flavor of the short rib one so I didn't finish it and the pork belly was hard indicating that it was overcooked. Mixed drinks were good, but a bit pricey. When the bartender noticed I hadn't eaten the tacos she did ask how I liked them. Then Beans came over to ask about the food, apologized that it was not up their or my standard and asked what they could do for me at the point in order for me to have a great experience. I declined any more food, but Beans insisted that I not be charged for food I didn't like and it was removed from my bill. I would revisit to give them another try after they work out the kinks.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, really. I saw it pop up one night when we had just gotten out of a show and we were searching for somewhere downtown that was still open. Since my visiting friend and I used to live in Bakersfield, we kinda joked that it would be funny to hit it up, and since we hadn't had enough time before the show to grab food, all three of us (me, husband, friend) were kind of on the ravenous side. The Yelp reviews sounded really positive too, although we're always extremely skeptical of Mexican food places in Pittsburgh; me having lived in a combo of SoCal and Bakersfield for decades and my friend having been born half-Mexican in Texas, on top of that.   Cute rustic decor, noise level was a little loud for my preference but seems about standard for a bar/food type place. I felt like the food quality was pretty good, but the flavors were a mixed bag. The queso was okay-ish but not great (we ordered it with the jalapenos added in, which was a nice kick). My favorite thing was the pork belly taco and I'd conceivably get it again if I ended up there, but my friend stopped eating halfway through his food because it was too bland, even with the added sauce, and my husband disliked his food so much that the previously-mentioned idea of \"again if I ended up there\" would pretty much not include him, as he was uninterested in going back (they also forgot to give him the margarita he ordered, which was irritating). Remember that we got there REALLY hungry, too, which should have encouraged more meal finishing.   I enjoy hipster tacos as much as the next foodie, but I think I will stick to Smoke for the hipster flavors and Las Palmas for the authentic ones. I agree with other reviews that the green salsa has the better flavor, however despite other assertions that calling a restaurant \"Bakersfield\" doesn't evoke a sense of real Mexican food, for someone who lived in Bakersfield this just doesn't fly with me. You don't want to be judged on being a Mexican joint, name yourself New York City. Bakersfield is full of Mexicans (hi Central Valley farm country!) and great, super-flavorful Mexican food. This wasn't it. :/",

I have been here so many times and I have one suggestion that you shouldn't pass up. Whether it's lunch or dinner or late night you have to try their margarita! They have 2 versions, the premium made with top shelf vodka or the Bakersfield. Whatever you choose doesn't matter because the key to the amazing margs is that they have magic elves juicing fresh limes in the basement. Nothing else can explain why I've become completely obsessed.  I don't even need to mention the tacos. Just remember that 2 tacos are a perfect portion and don't forget the quac.",

It's noisy but not impossible to have a decent conversation seated either at the bar or at a table. We ordered margaritas and sangria. The margarita was strong but balanced. The red wine sangria was warm (they didn't put the sangria in a chilled mixer) and bland.   We skipped appetizers and ordered five tacos: pork belly (2), fish, steak, and short rib. The pork belly pieces were too small and overcooked. Also there was no sauce on the taco, so the taco itself was also dry. The steak and short rib were excellent. The steak in particular is slightly spicy, very tender and the best by far. The short rib was a close second. The tortillas were dry and didn't add anything to the tacos.   In sum, Tako has Bakersfield beat by a mile. This definitely isn't worth waiting an hour for.",

I personally had some 3-4 tacos and a cocktail. I loved the pork belly taco and the steak taco. The tacos are really well made, with lots of interesting ingredients. The cocktail was house made and very refreshing.   Our server was really nice, given that our group was fairly disorganized.

We were here on a Tuesday evening, and while it was a weeknight, the restaurant was mostly full!  One of the members of our club had been here several times and convinced us to order the family style meal.  For only $15 a person we were treated to a very large order of chips and salsa, queso and guacamole!  The Queso was the star, it had ground beef and some nice jalapenos and red peppers on top.    Second course was two HUGE salads that were so delicious I would come back just for this salad.  Fantastic portion served with chunks of avocado and bacon and a delicious dressing.    Final course was a variety of four different tacos.  We each had two (remember there were seven of us) and there were a couple left over.  Options included pork, fish, vegetarian and beef.  The vegetarian was quite spicy but featured delicious chunks of mushrooms.   I will definitely be back and would encourage anyone that has a group over six people to order family style. The value is perfect but the food is amazing.",

    "text": "Tacos were good although little. The service was bad! I have never been so rushed through a meal in my life. I was still chewing my last bite of food when she was asking multiple times if we wanted anything else. I told her I needed a few minutes, and she took our plates. She then asked if we were going to have another drink or did we want our check. We had finished exactly 1/4 of each of our first beer at this point. We had been at the restaurant maybe 20-25 minutes total. I don't know if this girl was on speed, trying to go home, or usually only works peak lunch rushes or what, but what was intended to be a relaxed dinner and a couple of drinks turned into in and out in a half hour. This was a slow weekday night, there was no reason for it. Considering there are two other options within a couple of blocks, and the tacos are considerably better at one of them, I won't be returning.",

    "text": "OMG not only is the bar lined with bag hooks but outlets/USB ports too so you can charge devices. This alone is a plus!!!   PBR in a boot for 3 bux-heck yeah!  No this isn't an authentic taco joint but they're good. Bistec (steak) and Pollo Rojo so good. Love the chips and queso too. Tacos range about 4 bux a piece.  Daily drink specials. Shot of the day $3. Featured flights $15 and more.  All in all prices are decent for being in a prime downtown location. It's like a more upscale (but not really) neighborhood bar that happens to serve tacos.  3-330 pm on a weekday is a great time because the normal packed scene just doesn't exist. It's steady but you can get a seat anywhere; at the bar, booth or table.  Love the rustic/cowboy decor and the fact that the salads are named after country stars.  Normally very skeptical and jaded about chain establishments but this one is a-ok.  Bartenders and servers seem to really like working here. That's always a good sign.  Finally, again, outlets!!!!",

Maybe it was just a fluke the first time.   This time I came with just a friend and we were seated at a communal table with other people we didn't know. Awkward!   I started with the spiced apple margarita and it was great! We also got chips and guacamole and salsa. The verde salsa is the best. The rojo salsa tastes like smoked peppers and was sweet. I wasn't a fan.   For tacos I got the bistec and short rib. Both great but their tacos are super small!   It was a slower day this time and service was a lot better.",

My main issue, though, is the service. On my last visit, it took between 30-45 minutes to get our drinks after ordering them. Our server was barely around. Dinner took about two hours because they rarely came by. Our tacos came out on one tray for the table, but the person who brought them was unsure of which tacos were which. Made for an interesting eating experience.",

We waited well over 20 minutes for anyone to come over to help us; and even then, we had to flag someone down which took a few tries. Apparently the person who was supposed to be waiting our table was super busy and never showed up, so someone else took care of us after that.   Once we were able to order, everything else seemed to go smoothly.   Taco sizes are on the smaller side, so keep that in mind when ordering.",

    "text": "Found this during a lunchtime walk and came back for dinner the next night.  They opened last week.  Not open for lunch yet until they get all the kinks worked out, so I was told.  I thought the kinks seemed worked out at dinner service.  Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. She knew the menu well for being new to it.  I did not realize at the time of coming here that it was a small chain.  They have 5 other locations in 4 different states.  But it didn't seem like a chain.   They specialize in Tacos, Tequila, and Whiskey, but they have a good selection of beer and wine as well as cocktails.  They have a special shot for $3 every day of the week.  We started with the standard chips and salsa that is your foundation for every Tex-Mex type of place.  We were not disappointed.  The verde salsa was fabulous and the red smokey chipolte salsa kicked my butt, in a really good way!  The chips were also good.  No store bought tostitos.  We opted for 2 tacos each (could have pushed in 3).  I got the Mole and the Short Rib.  Both excellent.  They were not served with 2 thin tortillas to hold all the goods.  Instead, the goods were wrapped in one single corn tortilla shell that was thicker.  I particularly loved it more than 2 thin dry ones.  My husband had the Fish and the Pork Belly Pastor tacos.  He said both were good.    I will definitely come back here again.  Good service and food.  If I liked tequila and whiskey, I might love it even more.",

    "text": "Definitely has a good ambiance. We came mid afternoon and were promptly seated. I had the regular margarita. Flavorful with a hint of sweet. Our waitress India didn't really take the time to discuss the beers on draft. The only suggestion she gave was PBR. She also never took the time to explain popular menu items. We noticed the waitress at the table adjacent to us really took the time to explain different menu pairings.   The chips and guacamole were amazing. The chips were perfectly salted and the guacamole was made fresh. We asked for a side of salsa which I liked. It was more of a salsa verde; I definitely was expecting something different. If you want the more traditional salsa, ask for it. Otherwise they will bring the \"green salsa.\"  As an entree I ordered the short rib, steak, and chicken tacos. I seemed to need to doctor them up with the table salsas quite a bit. I'm not sure if this was the restaurant's intention. They did taste fresh with cilantro additions. The restaurant also used corn tortillas, which,  in general taste a bit drier to me.   Overall, not a bad experience, but I was expecting a little bit more. If I lived here, I probably would only come for appetizers and drinks.",

Then had two different tacos,  which this restaurant is known for. Loved the pollo rojo taco.  The pork belly taco was pretty good too. I topped it off with a pineapple margarita.  Pineapples are one of my b favorite fruits,  so I really liked this twist on a traditional margarita.  Downside: a bit too noisy for me.

I got the bang bang shrimp taco, and the 2 vegetarian tacos (cant remember what theyre called)  all of them had so much flavor. All made with simple and fresh ingredients, they truly made me feel like i was sitting on a beach in Florida. Also the service was very attentive and outstanding.",

    "text": "I first visited Bakersfield with a group of eight people on a Wednesday. I was worried about seating so we arrived early, about 4:20pm. Many of the small tables were already occupied, but all four large picnic bench style tables towards the front were free. We ordered a few baskets of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Both salsas (a sweet, smoky red salsa and a creamy cilantro salsa) were huge hits with everyone. I ordered the bistec and short rib tacos which were both delicious, but the bistec taco, with super tender meat and chipotle slaw, is what will keep me coming back to Bakersfield.  My second visit was with five people on a Saturday evening before a Pirates game. We were immediately seated downstairs in a big, comfy booth. This time I ordered the Willie salad, which is like a taco salad with a lime vinaigrette. It was SO good!  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the margaritas are extremely sweet. Each time I have gone to Bakersfield, I've ordered two margaritas. And both times I've had a stomach ache afterwards. By now I have learned my lesson and will try something else next time.  Overall, I was very satisfied with both my visits to Bakersfield. The Downtown options for a moderately priced dinner with a big group are pretty slim, so I'm sure I'll be back to hang out soon.",

    "text": "I'm from Ohio so I've eaten at the Bakersfield in Cincinnati and Columbus. Let me tell you, I was PUMPED when I saw a Bakersfield was opening in Pittsburgh!   My boyfriend and I went when they first opened last summer... but it was a weekend night and the wait was around 45 minutes. No thank you!   Fast forward to February... I decided to meet a girlfriend at Bakersfield after work for Happy Hour, thinking that it would be less crowded after work on a week day. I walked in and awkwardly stood next to the hostess table for about 5 minutes before a hostess came over and greeted me. At first I thought it was closed for a private party and I was crashing... it was mostly young adults in business work clothes. However, apparently this place is just a hot spot for the after work crowd.  One thing I immediately noticed was how loud this place is! Very echoey and you kind of have to yell across the table at the person you're with.  The service from the waiter was great, despite it being super busy. I got queso, a margarita and two tacos. Everything was exactly how I had remembered it from the Cincy and Columbus locations-- delicious. The queso was different-- a little spicy but nonetheless delicious. I don't think I've ever met a Taco I didn't like. Bakersfield definitely gives my favorite PGH Taco Place in the South Side a run for its money!   Overall: service 8/10, ambiance 6/10, food 10/10.",

Atmosphere is everything and the staff go along way to complimenting the classic country music and western movies playing behind the well stocked bar. Our server today was Dan and he was just fantastic. Kat (who was our server in our first visit) also popped by the table to say hello. It's been a few months since My first visit here and she remembered me and what I do for a living. That always makes me feel so fantastic. Sarah (possibly manager?) stopped by to congratulate us on our new marriage and give us a Bakersfield hoodie for our dog and stayed to chat for a bit. Overall this is my favorite place for tacos AND margaritas in the Burgh and I'm well versed on both. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but my personal favorites are The pork belly pastor and the Mole tacos. The queso is a must have. Add the chorizo and jalapenos!  Keep it up Bakersfield!",

We shared the humongous Laretta salad together after polishing off the queso and quac and chips. The fresh made quac was amazing, the queso flavorful putting your ordinary nacho cheese to shame. Mom and Dad ordered the salads and the girls dove right in. The salad had the perfect ratios of tomatoes, radishes, pepitos and dressing. The lettuce of mixed greens namely arugula held all the toppings quite well. Then we devoured the tacos. 9 between 5 of us. Everyone agrees the house made taco shell is to die for. You could put beef jerky between the fold and it would taste great. The short rib taco is the signature. Perfect combination of sweet and BBQ. The staff was amazingly friendly. We would definitely come again.",

And the guac tickled the taste buds. Tacos were on point. Some food for thought....some tables are communal but you have more room than other restaurants create with multiple small tables. But would still steer clear of taking a first date here. There's a bar in the basement but it's meant more for a drink before being seated on the main floor. If you grab a table in the basement, get your drink at the bar first and watch out for the distance between the chair and the table...it's a tight fit.",

They have a great special that serves 6+ people. It includes 3 courses. The first course is chips, salsa, guacamole, and queso. All of these item are delicious and they'll usually keep refilling the chips (which I believe are home made.) The second course is a salad. Large plates are brought over of greens, cheese, bacon, almonds, and other goodies. The last course is (of course) the tacos. Depending on how many people are in your group you'll get multiple plates of tacos. Each plate has 5 tacos, a chicken, pork, brisket, fish, and mushroom. And each is more delicious than the last. My only complaint is that the space isn't great for big groups to sit down. The tables can't really move so we typically have to squeeze if we come with more than 10 people. As for the happy hour. Usually we'll get pictures of their margaritas which are delicious! They are so flavorful and surprisingly (they add jalapenos to it so I think it masks the tequila taste wish is wonderfully dangerous.)  Although the tequila itself is very good! Very smooth to do shots with.  It's on the pricier side (duh, it's a downtown restaurant/bar) so I suggest to use it as a treat for either yourself or you and your work friends.",

    "text": "After visiting Bakersfield in Columbus, OH I was pleased to find out that there was one here in Pittsburgh as well. After a morning of meetings I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to check it out. Street parking wasn't bad as I got there right at 11 when they were opening. Just know, all parking meters are in the same side of the street and through the week you will pay $4 for an hour.  I'll tell you now, it is totally worth it!  In Columbus I had Chips and Guacamole but this time I opted to get the Queso as I had been told it is the way to go. I can now confirm as a Guac Fiend...the Queso is way better at Bakersfield!!! It is truly something unique and special. Pair it with the milder Cilantro based Green Sauce or spicy Red Sauce and you will have a winning combo!  I still hold a grudge that chips aren't complimentary but I'll get over it someday.  Now I loved the Shrimp Taco last time I had it and once again, it is one of the very best Tacos I've ever had! The slaw and sauce along with large shrimp just can't be beat. And while I wasn't blown away with the Al Pastor on my previous visit, this time it was far superior. I just wish the Pastor had a bit more crispness to it.  Quiet honestly, these are the best Tacos I've found in Pittsburgh to date!  I also tried their special Chorizo Chili and suggest you do as well if it is on the menu. An excellent blend of sweet and spicy that is hearty and filling.  This location was I bit smaller and more compact than Columbus but didn't feel cramped. It was well staffed and everyone I interacted with was friendly and helpful.  Playing old westerns on the TVs was also a nice touch.  If you are a Taco fan and nearby, get here ASAP!",

When we got in we put down our name and walked over to an open place near the bar. It was very busy and had shared seating - long booth on one side and high tops on other side. Bar has room to eat as well and there are usually two bartenders so your wait for a beverage isn't long.   After about 5min a seat opened at the bar so we took that and sat and watched the tournament games and talked about the week. Eyes big, hungry hearts type stuff. Soon there after, another seat opened at the bar and everyone got a seat so we put in a drink and food order there. The bartender (John? - Giants hat) was very attentive and got us going with drinks and some queso, adding that the food comes out somewhat fast so he staggered the app and food order so we weren't rushed.   ***NOTE: Tacos are small so make sure to order several***- which I was alerted to by my bud who had been there previously. We ordered several a piece and hung out sipping our beverages and hanging out. Time stood still.   Queso was VERY GOOD AND TASTY. The chorizo we added had a nice kick to it, and even though the chips were more plentiful than the queso, it was very good. As for the tacos - I ordered a chicken, steak and fish, and all three were good. They each were prepared a different way (slaw, sauce, etc) but all equally good with a nice tortilla. Chicken was more shredded with a hotter sauce, steak was cubed with a sweeter finish and fish was good and had nice sauce on it. Again, tacos were on the small side but overall the meal was just enough.   MAIN ISSUE: We ordered extra sour cream (or crema) and I mean to tell ya, it came in a condiment cup HALF FULL. I know it was only a dollar but we are big sour cream fans and feel like the amount we were given was like they were out of it or at the end of the container and just added enough.",

    "text": "Our monthly girls night out dinner was held at Bakersfield tonight.   Try the chips and queso or chips and guac to start - incredible. The chips are super salty (my favorite) and they give you plenty plus two types of salsas (the green one is my favorite!)   They always have a special taco. Tonight the special taco was chicken with some type of peanut topping so that leaves me out. No worries, I just like to look at the special menu. It has a special margarita too. Tonight it's grapefruit.   I ordered a glass of sangria. Amazing! It's a sweet red wine with lots of fruit (think apples and blackberries). It's served in a mason jar so portion is perfect. The glass is priced at $8. I drink a lot of sangria so that's reasonably priced for a drink not on happy hour pricing in the city.   For dinner is usually order the chicken tacos. If you order tacos with a group they come out on a large pizza tray - so cool. Tonight I tried something different - the chicken chorizo tostada. I highly recommend it. The portion size is perfect and the price is great. Tasty and filling.   This place is perfect for lunch, dinner or a few drinks. It has a chic urban feel with two dining areas - one upstairs where you walk in the main doors and on downstairs so do not be discouraged if it looks full when you first enter. The staff is friendly and always full of great recommendations. Make sure you try a signature margarita if you are a first timer!",

    "text": "Another great taco joint in Pittsburgh. Bakersfield offers several choices of tacos. Everything from; beef, chicken, veggies and fish. Unlike so many other taco places they actually have a wide variety of tacos to choose from.  Downside: the tacos are pretty small so you will have to order at least 3 or more to fill you up.  The chips and salsa is really good too. The salsa is fresh and has lots of flavor and a tad bit of spiciness. And the chips come out slightly warm so you can tell they are also fresh.  Another plus is they are open till 2am every night. So if you are needing somewhere to eat late at night and want better quality food then \"bar\" food Bakersfield is the place to go.",

Bakersfield set the bar high for the tacos that were to come. This place was PACKED! Between the people that were already dining and the reservations that were yet to come, our chances of eating here were slim. But we worked out a deal with the hostess who was very nice and understanding. We told him we were on a tour and there to only get one taco and one drink each. They were holding a table for a 3pm reservation and we had 30 minutes to order and eat. Challenge Accepted. My taco and drink of choice were the Bistec Taco and Pineapple Margarita! I regret nothing except not getting more! That taco was bursting with flavor. It was rather small, so if you're coming for a full meal, I definitely recommend 2-3. The pineapple margarita was glorious! So so good. I can't wait to come back here for a full meal, but great start to our taco tour.",

I did ask where the same Bakersfield originated, being that I've been to the city in California- and there wasn't a reason given. Lol  No one seemed to know the answer to that mystery.

Has a cool modern interior and lighting creating a nice dinner environment.  The restaurant also has good space given it has a full bar and seating in their lower level.  Larger tables on the first floor and communal bar make it relatively easy to meet there with larger groups of friends if you can handle a little wait.  I've been there several times, personally the shrimp, fish and steak tacos are my favorites.  The guacamole is also excellent with large chunks of fresh avacado.  The food has a little kick to it but haven't found it to be over spicy.  They have a full service bar with several types of fresh margaritas and daily specials. The beer selection is also very good, something for everyone with plenty of Mexican beers.  If you're in the area and looking for a solid restaurant choice, I would recommend checking out Bakersfield.",

Time for apps. We tried queso and guacamole. The queso was my 12 year old's favorite and he is super picky about queso. Burnt layer of cheese on top of some super yummy queso.  The chunky guac was very tasty too. On to the tacos. The 12 year old went basic with chicken, cheese and sour cream. He gave it a 9 out of 10.  I had the spicy chicken and a shrimp taco. Spicy chicken was a flavor explosion. The shrimp taco was even better. In fact, it was probably the best shrimp taco I have ever eaten. Very impressed. Our server Brendon was great.  The manager, McKenzie, was amazing. They took great care of us and talked to my son about taco tour.  Glad we chose here to start.",

I won't lie, I was hammered everytime I got their tacos, but holy god they were delicious! Then I tried them sober, and maybe it was an off day but the meat was dry and the saving grace was the lime I splattered over it and the cotija.  Ambience is great. This is a great way to start the night with a group friends and then make way over to nearby bars and what not. I like the rustic feel to it with communal tables. However, it can get pretty crowded on weekends and this does make it rather annoying. I don't blame them given the location and inability to accommodate more space or people.  They have a great selection of whiskey, I have to say and was one of the first establishments I've seen in PGH with Corsair whiskey. They even had my favorite, Quinoa Whiskey.   The cocktails were okay, not bad but I would probably head down (or up the street - I still don't know my way around Pittsburgh, even after four years) to Meat and Potatoes for fine cocktails.   Great place for group gatherings, awesome venue to start the night.",

    "text": "Food is excellent and our service was great! The server was very busy so the manager took our order an explained the menu extremely well. We went with his suggestions and we are pleased we did! The bakerfield margarita was FABULOUS!!! They definitely do not use pre bought mix and it shows! The steak tacos were my favorite! I actually had to order another one because it was so good. The tacos are on the smaller side so make sure you order an extra one or two than you normally would. This is not a bad thing..... It just lets you try more flavors! Guacamole was sooo good so definitely get some of that! So why did I only give three stars, you ask? Well, after dinner I used the restroom that was located downstairs and it was definitely not the cleanest. There was a thick layer of dust on the upper half of the walls and the fixtures. For it to be that thick it's definitely hadn't been dusted in a long, long time. So that is not that bad but what is that around the sink fixture there was a layer of gross slime. It was yellow and thick. I get that the fixure was leaking and that is why but that type of slime does not develop in just one day. I question how long ago that bathroom sink was cleaned because of this. It was seriously disturbing. For a place with such amazing food and service I am genuinely surprised the lack of care in keeping the restrooms clean. Hopefully the upstairs one is better.",

Also the chips to guac ratio is pretty good.  Go for drinks and chips/guac and you won't regret it. The red sangria is very good. Also, PBR is always on special for $3 and it comes in a boot glass. As for the other food I've had, it's decent, nothing has blown me away yet. It does get busy at times, but there is an additional bar downstairs.",

The restaurant's ambiance is really nice as well.   The food is so good. Order the chips and queso, it's definitely worth it. They give a huge pile of chips with it and it costs $6. I've been meaning to try the chorizo queso, but that's for next time. I highly recommend the tacos, specifically the fish tacos. They are $4 each but worth it. Every time I go I have to order their fish tacos. They also have seasonal margaritas, currently it is clementine hibiscus I believe. My boyfriend said it was very good, but it comes in a small mason jar. It costs $10  so its up to you if you believe that's worth it.   Service was friendly but the last time I was here, it was a little slow and we were wondering where our waitress was.   All in all, I highly recommend to go!",

Bakersfield is a little bit low-key in the sense that the name doesn't evoke tacos and tequila so much as it does gin cocktails and upholstered walls.  But it's the real deal, folks.  Nice little street-style tacos with the small corn shells, and with flavor combinations that venture into newer territory than your simple carnitas with cilantro and onions.  It's great.  And you know what's surprisingly great?  The salads!  They're huge, and the one I ordered the last time that I went was perfectly dressed.  It's a fun place to go with a big group, especially if you're the type to enjoy big booths that sit high off the floor, which I do...until it's time to slide out of them after a margarita pitcher, but whatever.  It's worth it.",

This place... I ate there on 8/8/17. The background music was way too loud - I could barley hear the waitress when trying to order food. When I did get my food ordered and delivered, the tacos were cold as if the meat had been sitting room temp for hours and the queso was soupy, cottage cheesy, topped with a cheese like Lilly pad, which was pretty unsavory, eek!  I highly recommend going to Tako for good tacos!",

We were able to get margaritas while we waited, and it wasn't too crowded to wait. The margarita was amazing. One of the better margaritas I've had in the area.   We got queso with chorizo, which was all right. I've had better queso, but it was still good. We just wanted to try something before our tacos. But, the queso came at the same time as tacos. I thought we'd get it to start, and now have all of the food brought at once. It might have felt a little less rushed to get the queso as an appetizer.  Tacos were good. Not the best tacos, but really affordable and flavorful. The al pastor had so much pineapple, maybe a little too much, but still had a good amount of meat. I loved the short rib tacos the most. Definitely really moist and flavorful, and delicious. I also got the pineapple margarita with my tacos, and that wasn't as good as the regular margarita, but was less acidic, which is a good thing.   I wish they had a happy hour, but the environment was great, service was quick, and the food was good. I'll definitely be back.",

I was able to get a reservation for this large party very easily and the entire staff was extremely friendly. John was one of, if not the best server I've had at this establishment. He was friendly, personable, and never thrown by the amount of people in our party and the multiple different orders we sent in at different times. He made the experience relaxing, enjoyable, and most importantly memorable. Thank you, John!!",

The service has always been top notch, even though it seems like they have a high turnover rate, feels like every time I'm there one of my favorite bartenders has recently quit.      The food is very good. Pretty typical Boutique tacos, queso, and tortas. The prices are a little above average but that's to be expected when you're downtown. Every night of the week they have 3$ PBR's and a different 3$ shot, for the drinker on a budget.       They have an upstairs and a downstairs, so even when it's packed there always seems to be just enough room to have your own space.      The only thing that I'm not a fan of is that they refuse to put sports on their TV's. They have old western movies on loop, which I actually really enjoy. However, if there is a Pens, Steelers, or Bucs game on, this is the last place you'll find me.",

Great service by the bar tender. She was attentive to us but yet left us to chitchat on our own.   FYI - I was here with my husband in the middle of the day on a weekday. It was a quite dining room and bar at first. Then the crowd picked up as it got to happy hour.  So my experience is based on a lunch time view. I'm sure the dinner time is much more crowded.

Although, you'd never know from the name, that it was a taco joint.  The waitress also told us that it's a chain (there are other locations in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Charlotte, and Nashville).   I am glad we came because I've wanted to check it out for a while now.  This was my first time here and I have to say I love the vibe of this place.  There were tons of people here for taco Tuesday but it's so big I never felt crowded.  We were seated downstairs and I liked it just as much as upstairs.   Mood lighting was perfect.  Our waitress, Lindsay, was super and gave great recommendations.  Love the chips and guac and I also loved my short rib tostada - it had a fried egg on it!  Our table ordered a variety of tacos but I only tasted the cochinita pibil (braised pork and pickled red onion) which  was incredibly spicy but pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the tostada a bit more to be honest.  Our pitcher of margaritas went down quickly - a little sweet but I liked it enough to finish the pitcher.  Would definitely return - it was a good time and great atmosphere.",

We got 6 tacos, which left us full, and our bill after tax and tip was $28.   I enjoyed all of the tacos we had.

I've tried a couple of their different tacos but I have narrowed down my favorite go-to tacos to the Al Pastor and Baja Shrimp. They are absolutely delicious and worth the $4 price. Their guac is also especially tasty, and is freshly made at the restaurant on a regular basis. Make sure to try their Short Rib Queso as well. It isn't too cheesy, which is exactly how I like my queso - to taste real and not like just some cheese wiz. If you're above 21, their Pineapple Margarita is also super delicious. It's sweet and tangy, and gives you a nice buzz!",

We ordered a ton of tacos - two huge plates full of them - and we got them in a timely manner. Our waiter was also friendly and funny, adding to the atmosphere. Great service! A solid 4.5/5.   As for the food, they're not the best tacos I've had. They were also a bit small for the price. However, the flavors were interesting and you could tell that the restaurant put a lot of thought into making different variations of traditional tacos, creating fusion food that was of high quality meat and other ingredients. Personally though, I'm just not a fan of some of the flavors, but that might also be because of my preference toward more traditional tacos. I give the food a 3.5/5.",

    "text": "If I was basing this review solely on food and drink, it'd be five stars. Although the menu is small, the variety of tacos is impressive, and the other dishes they offer are creative and tasty. The tacos are flavorful and the ingredients always seem to be fresh. The margaritas are delicious, and the beer selection is great too, with many local options. So yes, if you're looking for delicious food, definitely try this place.  However, if you're also looking for a place where you can talk to your friends without yelling, this is not the place. The few times I've gone, I've always been seated downstairs, and something is going on with the acoustics that amplifies every noise to the point where you literally have to yell to communicate with someone sitting next to you.   The service was lacking both times as well. Our server came around very infrequently and it took 20 minutes for me to get my first margarita. I was missing one of my tacos and never got a replacement, and my bill had items that belonged to two other people on it. As we had given up being attended to by our server, I just had my friends venmo me their portion of my bill. As much as I hate to do this, our table of 8 was being neglected so much that we began going to the bar for drinks. As a prior server, I try never to do this, but the amount of time we were waiting for refills (even on water, as we had three pregnant people in our group) was ridiculous.   The last thing I don't like is the way the tacos are presented. While it's cute the first time you see it, they all come out on huge trays and the server has to scream above the noise to tell you which ones belong to you. As it's so dark in there, if you don't hear the server it's impossible to tell which taco is which. Seems like a lot of work to maybe get what you ordered.   Overall, I'd definitely try this place again during an off-time, but during lunch or dinner hours, forget it.",

    "text": "After experiencing taco bliss at Tako, I had renewed hopes for Mexican food in Pittsburgh.  Then I came here and my hopes sank.  This place is slick. I should have been forewarned by the claim of 'authentic' Mexican - usually that's restaurant-speak for pretentious.  And it was.  The chips were covered with pounds of salt; the queso seemed like a warm bowl of ricotta; the bistek taco meat was tough and flavorless; and the short rib tacos tasted more like stewed carnitas.  The one thing I did enjoy was the strawberry margarita.  Sure, it was more like a daiquiri, but it was good enough to imitate at home.",

The shrimp ones were easily the best but the others weren't lacking either.  The only downside is that they're $4 each and not too big so you probably won't leave full but that doesn't change the fact that they're delicious.  I ate 5 and ended up going home to have another meal.  I will definitely be back here though.",

I was introduced to this place by my girlfriend who has been here a few times, and had a lot of good things to say about it, so one night I went with her and some of her friends to try it out. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the experience, so I think Bakersfield definitely made a good impression on me.  $4 tacos with all your traditional proteins like pork, beef, as well as fish, shrimp, and short rib. The taco sizes aren't huge, so I ordered four tacos, so just keep that in mind.   I also had the sangria, which was a bit stronger than I expected, but still tasty and went well with the food. The lighting was a little too dark in my opinion to see, and the high table with the sofa seating was a bit awkward since it felt like we were too low, but as a whole the ambiance is pretty nice since it gives you a relaxed vibe. Come check this place out!!",

The apps were very good. Excellent guacamole and salsas. Free chip refill finally came as we were paying the bill.   All 3 of us opted for tacos so we were able to try almost all of the varieties. The tacos are very small, even for street food type servings. They are served all on one platter so we all had to remember which we ordered. The tortilla was quite chewy. Fillings were OK but none were memorable.  The waiter was super sweet but not very good. No utensils are provided and, when requested, it took a long time to receive them.   He was the only waiter, though, for 4 tables of diners.   I don't need to go back..",

    "text": "Was really excited to try this place - won't be back though. We visited at 5p on a Saturday and were seated right away.   First off, if you're going to charge for chips and salsa, you're making a really bad impression - unless it's the best salsa ever.  This isn't. You get a red and a green. The red tastes like cooked tomato paste with barbecue sauce. The green is a little better but basically tastes like runny guac. There's no fresh taste in either salsa like you'll find at authentic Mexican places.   Next was the queso. There are few things I love as much as queso and even the not-so-good ones are still pretty good. This was the biggest disappointment of the meal and THE WORST QUESO EVER!!!!!!  I don't know what was going on - it looked great in a little cast iron skillet with bubbly golden cheese on top. Unfortunately, that bubbly golden top was hard and impossible to scoop through. We had to break it up with a spoon (!). It gets worse. Under that cheese was some thick, your chip gets stuck and breaks off, pasty substance that I can only compare to hummus - if you baked it dry or something. Unacceptable and just so, so bad.   The hongos and bistec tacos were good. The papas tostada was okay. The pollo rojo tasted like fish for some reason and wasn't eaten after the first bite.   The drinks were excellent though. (Still doesn't make up for that queso though!) We had a premium margarita and la Paloma. Fresh and delicious! If I wasn't honest, could've gotten one of those drinks free as our semi-stressed server forgot to put it on the bill and had to be reminded.   Everyone who works there is friendly and energetic. There's a decent feel to the place and a good selection of music.   So don't go out of your way but if you're in the area, maybe stop in for a drink. But eat somewhere else. And don't get the queso!",

If you can head over right at 5, you can most likely grab a spot at the bar downstairs. I am a margarita lover, and these are the best I've had in Pittsburgh. I've tried most all of their tacos, but I'm a creature of habit and usually default to one fish (typically I get two for dinner). The guac and the queso are both awesome, and typically come out with warm chips. The crowd here for happy hour is pretty standard, I've even gone midday on the weekends, but I will say that when I tried to come on a Friday night I was relatively turned off by the packed house and clientele. That's life on a Friday night - and in no way changes the fact that this place is fantastic.",

She had a constant smile and was giving us the right dose of service!  I do not like cilantro and it unfortunately comes on most of the tacos.  The good thing is that most of them just have it on top as a garnish, except for a few.  Of course the mahi mahi fish taco had it in the slaw that came with it.  I ordered it sans slaw and got the lime sauce only.  They were very accommodating and brought the slaw out separately, in case I could stomach i!  I also got the braised short rib taco.  This was a very rare choice for me since I am mainly a pescatarian, but wow! It was the best recipe I had ever had.  The meat was cooked for several hours, was soft and just melted in your mouth.  It had a sort of cinnamon taste to it so I asked Kaitlyn what was in the \"sauce\" She coyly smiled and told me it is a secret recipe but I was on to something by tasting cinnamon.  I also tried a regular margarita.  She asked me exactly how I liked it and it came out exactly how I had asked.  My friend decided to try a Manhattan and she had also asked how he would like it and BAM, exactly how he asked.  In addition to the tacos we had the queso.  I am not typically a fan of queso, chips and salsa, etc. but I liked that you could add ingredients, such as black beans, chorizo, etc.  We added the black beans.  This delectable app. came out on a small iron skillet dish, with warm and house-made chips.  The chips were a nice consistency (not too thick, but didn't break easy) and the queso was by far the best I ever had.  It is real cheese, a gooey, warm skillet of comfort for sure!  Kaitlyn also suggested that we take a peek downstairs at the space they had.  It isn't always open during lunch but it was on this particular day because of many events in the city.  It is a perfect spot for a celebratory dinner or birthday gathering with a group of friends.  The bar upstairs and downstairs is very spacious and the decor is rustic and similar to a lot of the gastro pubs but it also had it's own flair.  I highly recommend this place.  The only downside of course is parking since it is downtown.  If you have a show or you are looking for a great atmosphere to meet friends, this is your place!  Welcome to the Burgh Bakersfield!",

The Starbucks in our hotel recommended us to try Bakersfield for some tacos and cheap drinks since it was right across the street from where we were staying. We came in for a late dinner on Saturday night and went downstairs to sit at the bar because upstairs was a bit crowded. Our bartender was fantastic, and not only had great knowledge of the menu, also gave us a good lesson on the difference between the types of tequila, because we didn't know about aged tequilas. Our margaritas were delicious, I had the spicy and it was just right on the spice. We ordered the guacamole after he said it's made fresh, and it was delicious! This might have been the best guacamole I've ever had. We ordered 2 tacos each, all were great. My hubby got a pork belly and the only thing he mentioned was a little bit of extra liquid on the taco which made the tortilla just a bit soggy..

    "text": "I visited Bakersfield with a friend for dinner last night at 6pm before attending a concert at Heinz Hall.  They don't take reservations or allow the use of NoWait to get in line ahead of time, so we opted to sit at the bar, given that it was quite busy and that the wait for a table was running 30-40 min.  Fortunately, there were two stools available, so this worked out quite well.  I started out by ordering the Bakersfield margarita ($8), and my friend also ordered one after trying mine.  I agree with another reviewer that it was on the sweet side, but the liberally salted rim provided a nice contrast.  It's served in a ball jar, so I felt that the value for the money was good in terms of quantity, but I'm not sure how strong it was as I didn't feel noticeably buzzed after drinking the whole thing.  For an appetizer, we ordered the chips and guac ($7), which was solid.  The chips, which were served warm, were on the salty side, but they weren't waxy, unlike the chips at some other local establishments.  The guac had chunks of avocado, so you could tell it was freshly made, and its flavor had a great zing from the lime.  Red and green salsas were also provided in squirt bottles of the type used for ketchup, etc.  While I enjoyed the red one more than the green one, I wasn't a huge fan of either, given that they seemed rather watery and that I prefer larger chunks in my salsa.  Despite being described as mild and medium, both salsas had a spicy kick, so I recommend applying them lightly at first if you're spice-averse.  For our entree, my friend and I ordered two tacos each.  We both ordered the pork belly pastor ($4), I ordered the huitlacoche ($4), and my friend ordered the hongos ($3).  The huitlacoche taco, which consisted of corn and corn \"truffles\" (smut), as well as some other veggies, had a very earthy and complex flavor, and was unlike any taco I'd ever tried before.  According to my friend, the hongos taco, whose main ingredient was mushrooms, also had an earthy flavor, but it probably was more subbdued than the earthiness of the huitlacoche taco.  Both of us enjoyed the pork belly pastor taco, which, in addition to the titular ingredient, included pineapple and peppers that gave it a bit of a spicy kick.  We both felt that the tacos were on the small side, esp. given the price, so I recommend planning on 3 apiece if you're hungry.  At the time of our visit, the noise level was extremely high due to the crowd.  Unlike one of their nearby competitors, they don't play high volume music to drown out the sound of people talking, but it's just as challenging to carry on a conversation with your dining partner.  Service was generally good, though it could be (understandably) challenging to attract the attention of the bartender given that the crowd kept her working hard during the duration of our visit.  There was some slight awkwardness with the check, given that she knew we were paying separately but didn't provide us with separate checks, but it wasn't a huge deal given that there ended up being only a $1 difference between our totals.  Overall, we were generally pleased with our meal at Bakersfield, and would return, if at a less busy time.",

She was attentive, fun, and very sweet. She pointed our group in the direction of the selecciones de la casa which is a great option for large groups. It comes with chips with guacamole, salsas, and queso as well as a salad and a variety of tacos. More than enough to eat and plenty tasty! I definitely recommend Bakersfield for your large groups (make reservations), and if you happen to get London, then you're lucky.",

    "text": "I had a hankering for some tacos on a Saturday morning. Turns out 11:30am is the perfect time for Tacos and Tequila. There were only two other tables of diners in the joint so we got seated right away.   I went splitsies with my husband, so I got to try a lot of different things.   Jalapenos margarita: This was pretty yummy. I liked that I got a lot of jalapeno flavor without too much spice. I did think it was a little too sweet, though. Tastes like maybe they use sweet and sour mix? I prefer a more tart, alcohol forward marg.   Queso: I really enjoyed the flavor (the chorizo and the jalapenos were a nice addition). But I was thrown off by the hummus-like texture. When I order queso I want you to give me molten liquid cheese so I can pour it down my throat. You better believe I ate it all though because... cheese.   Fish Taco: Great if you really like the taste of fish. I know that sounds kind of dumb and obvious, but this particular fish taco had a much more fishy taste than most I've had. This was my husband's favorite.   Short Rib Taco: Hands down -- This one was my favorite. The short rib was tender and the flavor was so good!   Pork Belly Taco: I'm not a fan of pork belly. Not even a little bit. But I tried a bite and whoa the flavor combos were heavenly. The chili and the pineapple made me happy. The little cubes of pork belly were fatty and perfectly pork belly-ish.   Huitlacoche Taco: This is what they call the \"corn truffle taco\". Otherwise known as \"corn smut\" or pathogenic corn fungus (don't google it, just eat it). Earthy but mild and really enjoyable.   Mole Taco (braised chicken): Couldn't really taste the mole on this one, but it was still really good. The pickled red onion was on point.   Important to note that the tortillas are pretty small, but they are delicious!  Overall, a good first experience at Bakersfield.",

    "text": "My experience here was quite underwhelming. I was here early after work on a weekday and sat at the bar with my friend and ordered the grapefruit margarita. It was ok, a tad too sweet for my taste. As I looked at the menu, I had some questions about vegetarian options and asked the bartender if a certain dish was vegetarian. Our bartender that day was NOT in a good mood. He seemed annoyed that I had a question in the first place. He didn't even look at us and mumbled a response. I couldn't catch what he said, but a bit intimidated by his attitude, didn't ask him to repeat it. We ended up ordering the papas toastadas which tasted good. But by then, I needed my next drink! Uhoh.. time to get our pissed off bartenders attention again! I got the spicy margarita. Normally I love a kick to my drink but what I was served that day was undrinkably hot.. Sweet, but also really really hot. One sip had my lips, mouth and insides on fire. My friend, whose spice tolerance is much higher than mine felt the same way. We asked for water (much to our bartenders annoyance) and waited a whole 10 mins for it! By then the bar had gotten busier and I certainly didn't want to deal with the already grumpy bartenders attitude if I requested an adjustment to my drink. So, as a favor to my digestive tract, I left my entire drink untouched. Oh, we did order their two vegetarian taco options which tasted fine. But if it's tacos and awesome margaritas you're craving, I'd direct you to Tako or Condado tacos, both of which are in the same area. Better cocktails, better tacos and the added benefit of not having to feel like you're getting on your server's nerves every time you order/have a request.",

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night around 8:30 pm and there was a 1 hour and 45 min wait! The hostess gave us the tip to go hang out at their downstairs bar but that was jam packed too! FYI, you can order food there too but we had no luck even finding a spot to stand. So we left.   Came back the next day at around 4:30 pm and there was no wait. Score! However, with all the hype, I was a little disappointed. The hubby and I ordered the chips and queso and all tacos: bistec, fish, short rib and pork belly pastor. The queso had a gooey topping but the rest was a ricotta cheese-like texture which I'm more a fan of smoother queso. Flavor was there, but I just didn't like the texture. In terms of the tacos, I've definitely have had better tacos for both less money and more money. Bakersfield's tacos were quite bland and did not blow me away. If I had to pick a favorite of the ones we ordered, I would pick the bistec which had a bit of spice. The pork belly was pretty tough to chew on, despite it being a fattier cut of pork. The others just didn't stand out to me. One thing to note is they do bring out two bottles of their salsas: their verde (fresh, yet creamy) and their rojo (spicy and smoky). The salsas add a bit of flavor to the tacos and they are in handy squeeze bottles, making them easy to pour on your tacos.   I most likely will not come back for the food here, but rather their drinks. They have an extensive tequila and whiskey menu. The atmosphere is so hip and new so it's definitely a fun environment for cocktails!",

The atmosphere had that old west feel to it with southern blues / old style country playing in the background and a John Wayne movie on the TV above the bar. I took a seat at the bar and was cheerfully greeted by the barmaid. She mentioned a few of the drink specials (tequila inspired) but knowing that I needed to get back to work I nodded them off and went with an ice tea and a menu.   The menu here is all Mexican cuisine... tortilla chips, tacos, tostadas, tortas and few salads. Although I came for lunch, I couldn't help but look over the beer selection. Among the choices are Dos Equis, Negro Modalo, Carona, Pacifico etc. along with a health selection of domestics and crafts. Perfect beer selection to compliment the Mexican cuisine.   After ordering the Short Rib Tortas, I kept my eye out for what was coming out of the kitchen. The tacos, albeit smallish, all looked yummy but the few salads that I saw were of a generous portion. It didn't take long for my tortas to arrive and it had a plentiful amount of shaved short rib, greens and cheese between a ciabatta like bun with a nice, spicy salsa dip on the side. The tortas was not only filling but delicious.   I'm looking forward to coming back to sample some of the tacos and I'll also keep this place in mind as a location to meet up with friends for a drink prior to a show or game.",

Service in here is usually great via the wait staff, although the hosts could be a little nicer (I mean, you are the first face customers see, right?).

They only take reservations for larger parties but my Mom and I had no issue getting a table (maybe a 5 min wait) at 6pm on a Thursday night. There were definitely people there so it was a fun and upbeat vibe. The tacos only come with one so we ended up ordering two of each so we could each try one and got multiple things (tapas style). The pineapple margarita I had is the sweetest on the menu and I LOVED IT! Their queso dip is really good as well and extremely popular. The bartenders and our server were very personable and got our food and drinks out very quick. I will definitely be back next time I'm Downtown!",

My coworker and I usually go to Condados after work, but they were closed. Unlike Condados, their vegetarian options were shockingly limited. I feel like I had this problem 10 years ago, but especially with Mexican food, it's not hard to make veg dishes! That was nothing in comparison to the fact that seemingly no one was working. There was no hostess, so we sat by where other people were, hoping to be noticed, and it took at least 15 minutes to even see a waitress or be acknowledged. We decided to just get a drink since who knows how long it would've taken for the waitress to keep coming back. I understand being understaffed but I definitely will not be recommending to customers at work or returning.",

Our server Lindsey, treated us SO WELL! I hope she gets to see this, because she made our experience a great one. I think my friend had such a great birthday here. They even treated us to a birthday shot from their shot of the day (which was whiskey) since they don't sing happy birthday here apparently?? (Sorry we didn't drink it, our friend wasn't feeling shots from the night before. Appreciate it tho!!) Taco sizes aren't too small but also not too big, and I got decently full from two but also I stuffed myself with chips..  CHIPS AND GUAC ($8?): Their chips are so addicting. I kept eating even after I finished my tacos.. Omg. Their other salsas are soooo good too! I think the brown one was habanero but my friends kept joking saying it tasted like barbeque. BISTEC TACO ($4): Very sweet. Not sure if I'd order again, but it was still really tasty! FISH TACO ($4): Fresh cole slaw and crispy tacos. Omnomnom. RED SANGRIA PITCHER ($36): Wowow. So tasty and refreshing! For a party of 7, the pitcher was plenty and such a great deal. The last time I was here, we had ordered their Bakersfield margarita which was also yummy, but a bit strong for my tastes.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a fun date night if you love yummy tacos and margaritas!",

Luckily my two friends ordered toastados, which were pretty big and filling so I was able to have a bite of both. The pork taco was a bit on the salty side but the pineapple cubes were a good touch. The fish taco was probably my favorite - not too salty or bland. We also ordered chips and queso with jalapenos. The ratio between chips and the queso wasn't even in that we had more chips left over but the queso was pretty good.   As for the drinks, I ordered their seasonal margarita which was the pineapple margarita and it was soooo good. I would definitely recommend coming soon for this one. My friend got the Bakersfield marg and another got a red sangria. I would say the pineapple marg was the best one out of the three, then the Bakersfield marg and then the sangria.   The atmosphere wasn't too packed, very chill, and just felt like a place for a nice girls night out.",

The place itself has a very cool rustic style, it's two levels. The music is maybe a little loud. They have a great assortment of beers and mixed drinks. Can't beat a $3 PBR, their original margarita is also really good. Their guacamole is perfect, had it last night. Huge chunks of avocado.

But anyway, I ended up here on the recommendation of my friend after the concert I attended ended prematurely (boo). Being that It was after ten, the place was pretty empty except for the bar area. I was greeted by one of the bar tenders and ordered my beer. From there I had to decided which of the delicious tacos I was about to enjoy. I ended up ordering the Mahi and the bistec. While the steak was pretty good and the chipotle slaw complimented it well, I really fell in love with the fish. It was the perfect amount of crispy (i love things to be crispy), the citrus slaw complimented the fish very well, and the tabasco lime sauce brought something to the taco that I definitely never had before. Go for the fish you wont regret it!  The guys beside me had the chorizo chili. It smelled like heaven and they each said it was fantastic, can't wait to try it!   The bar also has ports to charge your phone, and hooks to hang your bags! That is definitely a plus in my book!",

The servers were fairly quick and attentive, though toward the end of our stay a bit less. We waited a long time for our waiter to come by so we could ask for a check.   Food was pretty good! I ordered the Bistec tacos, which had a bit of a kick to them. Unfortunately, that kick was the only flavor in them.   Also, the margaritas were okay. Really sweet. But ok.   All in all, this \"trendy\" looking bar wasn't awesome, but it was okay. They seemed to put more energy into Edison bulbs and appealing to the mustachioed 20-something, rather than the food and drinks themselves.   That's just me. I'm in Austin, so the hipster stuff isn't so dumbfounding to me anymore. But I think this bar could back up that hipster BS with a little authenticity.",

The original Bakersfield margarita is already superb but the pineapple margarita is a real superstar.  The food is good, but I do caution that the tacos are pretty small and a white corn tortilla (some people love corn tortillas, others not so much). If you're getting tacos I recommend huitlacocche. The tostadas and tortas are much more generous portions than the tacos. I have also tried the salsa, queso, and guac on various occasions all of which are fresh and tasty. The queso is different from the usual thick cheesy soup - a  slightly grainy soupy underlayer (containing peppers and maybe thickened with potato) and a melted cheese coating. That may not sound so great but my friends and I were all fans.  On a side note, Bakersfield does allow reservations now which is great! I would like to see a happy hour there though.",

I came in on a Monday night and sat at the bar, took a minute for the bartender to say hello, but he eventually did and he gave me a menu. Small basic menu, chips & salsa, a couple salads, couple tostadas, sandwiches and a number of tacos. I started with chips and salsa and a premium margarita. Margarita came in a tall highball glass, it was pretty but way too sweet for me . Chips came out warm with a tomatillo salsa - tasty but not spicy at all. I ordered 1 fish taco and 1 bistec taco. They were good, not spectacular, but tasty. A Pittsburgh taco. I also added a side of black beans - whoa!! Way too salty!! Not good, way too much salt. Overall my meal was fine. I was missing my mom's homemade Mexican cooking, I was hoping this meal would satisfy that craving just a little bit, but sadly it did not. Nothing beats moms homemade beans & tacos. Ambience was great, would I come back - eh, not really sure.",

I started with the basic house margarita, which is made special through the use of fresh squeezed lime and lemon juices...just amazing.  The guacamole is simply amazing, brightly flavored and nicely chunky, topped with the delightful addition of thinly sliced radishes.  I had both the steak and short-rib tacos, and both were delicious, in fact, the short-rib one was one of the best items I have eaten anywhere.  The friend I was with is a vegetarian, and got both the Huitlacoche taco and a potato tostada, both of which he declared fantastic.  There are two table sauces, a nice creamy green including cilantro and avocado, and a red with a real nice slow burn on it.  One added bonus...every day there is a featured shot for $3, usually either bourbon or tequila, and one can always get a \"boot\" of ice-cold PBR for $3.  Do NOT miss this place!!! It is simply AMAZING!!!",

We ended up going upstairs and had wonderful service from a woman named Brittany. Didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for my food. The entire experience was phenomenal, from the hostess to our table service. I will absolutely recommend Bakersfield to anyone for some greatly priced food and amazing service.",

If you want another beer, just keep eating since the bar keeps are inattentive (whilst even seated at the bar?!).

I was craving a margarita & being from out of town on business, I asked YELP to help me out- Bakersfield Penn here I come. We were worried about how busy it looked inside, but the hostess was nice enough to make room at a community table for us, she assured us that our server (insert name here) would be with us shortly. Well, after about 10+ long minutes of no hello, no water, no.... anything... I was able to make eye contact with a bartender (Paige) and she came right over. She asked what she could do for us & we explained that we seemed to be forgotten. She immediately apologized and took our drink & appetizer order. Quickly the manager, Alex, came over to say sorry & make sure we were still satisfied, he also let us know that (insert name here) would be with us shortly to take our dinner order. Once again.. 15-20 minutes go by with out anyone to come by. We let Paige know & she was very apologetic & seemed embarrassed that her coworker had abandon us. Paige informed us that it was actually her first week & was still learning but would take our orders and make sure we would be taken care of from then on. Alex came over and explained that this was not how things usually were there but did not try to make excuses, he just took ownership & handled it. We had delicious & fresh food, based on Paige's recommendations. I was not disappointed. I would come back here & will let my local friends know that this place is WONDERFUL - great atmosphere, tasty food, strong drinks & friendly staff. THANKS!!",

The taco's were delicious, and they were able to maintain the right number of taco's on the buffet table - not too many that they get cold, but enough on the table at all times so that they are hot and ready for people arriving at different times.  The noise level, which is a major concern of mine since many places make it impossible to talk, was appropriate that you could talk to the person next to you, but a little hard to hear the person across the table.  Their tacos, chips and dips were delicious.  Several months ago,  I was at Bakersfield,  with family,  We all thought it was delicious then, and they have been able to maintain their quality and standards.  I will certainly be back.",

The salsa comes in a spicy red version and then there's a salsa verde - both on the more watery side, but in a tasty way.  The guacamole is thick and delicious.   As for dining options, steer towards the taco choices.  They're served a la carte so you can pick and choose and the sampling I purveyed were super good.

Our waitress was friendly and helpful in describing the menu and offering recommendations for food and drinks. Our drinks came quickly.   I ordered an entree salad and all the others in our group ordered tacos. The tacos came out on a big tray in a reasonable time frame due to how busy the restaurant had gotten. However, my salad didn't come out for another ten minutes or so. I wasn't too bothered by the delay but someone else immediately came over and apologized. She said she would be taking the salad off my bill because \"they do not like food to come out like that to a table\". I was really impressed by this, especially since it really wasn't that long of a delay and I didn't even have to say something to them. Plus, the salad (The Willie) was DELICIOUS!  I highly recommend going to Bakersfield for your next taco fix!",

We got a margarita pitcher which between the two of us was like 5 short drinks per  Got chips and cheese  and a variety of tacos. By far the best was the short rib taco. Being from California I've had some good short rib tacos before, but this was amazing.",

Only thing I had to look at was the bartender who prepping for his service, LOL.  I'd eat here again.",

The guac is AMAZING! The short rib taco ($4) is my taco of choice and the steak taco is take it or leave it.  Lunch service is also fast if you are on a time limit. Did I mention the guac is phenomenal?!?",

    "text": "Bakersfield is an interesting mix between \"Wild West\" and Mexican food, but it's all very Americanized. That being said, I love going here for happy hours and with large groups for drinks, but if I want authentic southwestern OR Mexican food, this probably isn't the place. They have a solid selection of beers and cocktails. The space is huge, an upstairs and downstairs. Tables are large and open. People may be standing around the bar or just casually in groups as well if they're just getting drinks.   Either way, they do have a lot of options for tacos! Although feta and radicchio may not be common in a typical Mexican taco, if you go into it knowing this is Americanized, the tacos are great. Vegetarian and vegan options that are enjoyable rather than boring.  Definitely bring your next work outing to Bakersfield.",

    "text": "Best customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant/bar!! Absolutely no tolerance for harassment!  We decided to go to Bakersfield last minute when we were downtown last night.  It was busy for a Thursday, so we just got a drink at the bar while we waited a reasonable time for a table.  While at the bar, we met two gentlemen.  They were nice and we got to talking as we killed time and sipped our drinks.  Our table was soon ready, and we followed the hostess downstairs where we were seated.  The bathrooms are also located downstairs, so when one of the men went to use the restroom he spotted us and came over to our table.  At this point the man was visibly intoxicated.  We were never uncomfortable, but being that he was drunk and we were not, he was very chatty and started to overstay his welcome.  Five minutes into the man standing at our table, I noticed many staff members (our server, another server, and the manager) make eye contact with me over the shoulder of the man and ask if we were okay.  The manager even approached the table at one point and asked, \"Is there anything I can get out of your way?\" even though we hadn't even touched our food yet.  I thought that was a very clever choice of words.  Eventually we were able to convince the man to leave and when I told Bree about the staff eye contact, I was told that they were doing to they were doing the same thing behind my back to her.  Bakersfield's no tolerance for harassment policy was amazing to see, and the fact that they all went out of their way to make sure we were okay was a breath of fresh air.  I have rarely had a bar-type atmosphere care, let alone go out of their way to make sure that I felt safe and comfortable.  The manager even came over after and apologized for our experience.  I would 10/10 recommend this place to my friends and family.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere is unique, and it was hands down some of the friendliest, best customer service I have ever received!!",

Here goes;   I like the spot in terms of vibe, I actually picked going here based on the pics here on Yelp. It's nice & clean and new.   It's busy but FAST so I bookmarked this one for an \"in a rush\" night downtown because you can eat and drink and be out in 45 or less. Amazing.   Down side? We were hoping for a romantic-ish night and it was a little too fast read: no up sell on the drinks etc...kids...loud bridge & tunnel types in for shows....not a great place to play footsie.   Food: Fair price, decent flavour. I had a salad, we had chips/guac and hubby had 3 tacos (the only 2 vegetarian types).   All in all the staff was good, service was good, food was fine...we will be back it's just not \"THE\" destination.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been wanting to try it for a while, but everytime I look on Nowait, it said there was a long wait and you can't get in line until you go to the restaurant. So we waited for a Sunday night with no sporting events and the wait was less than 10 minutes.    Back to the food: it was super tasty and all the combinations were well done.  We got the chili, which appears to be disappearing off the menu soon.  It was a great pairing with the chips and queso, which were also out-of-this-world good.  The chili definitely had some kick to it.  Don't get it if you can't handle any heat.    We also had the short rib torta.  It was amazing.  It was the perfect mix of meat, arugula and bread.  It was good by itself, the tomatillo salsa that came with it was just ok and didn't add that much flavor.    We rounded it off with the conchinita pibil taco and the short rib taco.  Both were a perfect taste combination between the meat, toppings and tortilla and we would definitely get both again.    We did try a margarita!  I added it on last minute and didn't have a menu in front of me.  I asked for a \"fruity margarita\" (I know, not very classy) and they brought a great homemade blackberry margarita.  It was well made and the truly classy version of a \"fruity margarita\" and definitely not skimpy on the tequila.   The only quibble with a minor service issue that Jen, the manager, more than made up for.  In fact, she identified the problem before we brought it to her attention and went out of her way to make it a spectacular experience.  What started as problem turned in a great night out after a long day and we are hooked on this place and will be back.  It's worth the wait!",

The staff were also very personable. Now to the star of this place... The tacos! Specifically I fell in love with the Mahi Mahi Tacos. It's crispy, crunchy, flavorful topped with a slaw and packed with so much flavor! The slaw isn't overpowering and works really well with the Mahi Mahi. I was so upset that I was full after two of them as I wanted to eat them all day. It's also great to know that they make everything they can fresh from salsas to the corn tortillas. I can't wait to come back to try their margaritas and veggie tacos.",

I would be happy going to either but for drinks and queso/salsa,Bakersfield has it down. For tacos, I prefer Condado.   The margs at Bakersfield are the best in the city and their queso is unique and so flavorful. The red salsa we ordered had this amazing smoky flavor that is hard to beat.   I ordered the Milanesa Torta because it was recommended as soon as we sat down. It was pretty good! I tried the tacos my boyfriend got - Shortrib and Bistec - and they were pretty good too. The flavors were really good but I appreciate a larger variety of textures and ingredients in my tacos which I thought they lacked here.",

Our waitress was friendly and the service was quick - neither the food nor drinks disappointed!   The downstairs portion can get a little loud with all the chatter (we didn't mind,) but it's definitely something to take into consideration.   Also, order the short rib taco and try the seasonal cucumber margarita; you will not regret it!   Four of us split a margarita pitcher and there was more than enough for each of us to fill our glasses at least twice.   Parking: It can be a challenge to find street parking, but there is a garage about two blocks away on the corner of 9th and Penn - in total i was parked for over 4 hours and paid $6 on a Wednesday   Happy Hour: Their website doesn't mention any and we arrived way past normal \"happy hour time;\" however, the $3 shot of the day option is always a good choice!",

    "text": "I'm so glad we finally got to Bakersfield! We were there on a Sunday afternoon and it was perfect timing the two of us were able to get a table without a wait. We parked in a parking garage just down the street, the same one we park in whenever we visit a restaurant on Penn Avenue.   I want to point out the thing that I noticed most about Bakersfield is that every single employee was happy, helpful, polite and genuinely glad to be there. From the host at the front, to our waitress, to the bartenders. Other restaurants should take note because your workers are the face of your business, and if they aren't good it won't matter how delicious your food is. Our waitress was Rebecca and not only was she perky and fun, she was knowledgeable about the menu and was always around when we needed her. If I could pick her up and take her with me to every restaurant I would.   I started off with a pineapple margarita while my husband had the Negra Modelo. I got my margarita with a sugar rim, and why I've never done that before is beyond me. That was Rebecca's suggestion and one of the best ones I've ever got! The margarita was delicious. I told my husband we have to go back just to sit at the bar and drink some more of those one day.   Since I read so many rave reviews about the guacamole we had to try that as a starter. My husband is not a huge avocado lover and he said it was amazing. That has got to tell you something about the guacamole and chips... it's a must have!   Between the two of us we ended up trying five different tacos, three for him and two for me. We went with the chicken, the al pastor, the short rib, shrimp, and the fish. These are tiny tacos so I would suggest two for a woman and three for a man if you have an appetizer as well. If you're not going to have an appetizer I would go for a 3 and 4 respectively. All fresh ingredients, all done right, and lots of goodies packed onto a tiny corn tortilla. My husband's favorite was the al Pastor(also recommended by Rebecca), he said the pineapple on it just pushed the flavor profile over the top. I was particularly fond of the shrimp taco, perfectly battered and fried little nuggets of goodness.   Bakersfield offers a 10% military / VIP discount but honestly it is worth paying full price! Couldn't be happier with the afternoon we spent there, looking forward to those margaritas... :-)",

    "text": "I find myself suggesting Bakersfield to a lot of people that ask me for downtown dinner recommendations... you can never go wrong with tacos, am I right?  Bakersfield's taco treats are ordered a la carte, which can get pricey depending on how hungry you are, but I like that I can pick 2-3 different delicacies to satiate my required taco intake.  The tortillas here are to die for - handmade in-house by their very own masa magicians, they are small yet mighty and stand up to the substantial amount of fillings they pile on.  The fish taco is one of my favorites and packs a generously-portioned piece of lightly fried mahi with just the right amount of crisp cabbage slaw.  The pollo asado is also excellent, topped with a tomatillo crema... Part of me wants to order a side of that and dip everything on the table in it.  It's so good!    On one occasion, my family gathered here for my birthday dinner and we elected to order the \"Selecciones de la Casa\" - which is a family-style serving of chips and guac, queso, a salad, and an assortment of tacos to share for just $15 per person!  Ours included the Johnny salad, and my family STILL talks about how yummy it all was! It's a total steal if you plan to come here with a group of 6 or more.    No matter what you order here, I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend you to wash it all down with a jalapeno margarita or two - theirs is one of my favorites!",

I came here for lunch when the restaurant had a handful of seated tables, but wasn't crowded by any means. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nowhere to be found, so it took some time to put our order in. Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, but we were definitely hungry!  The chips and salsa were good, and I like that they give verde (green) salsa instead of the regular salsa. My tacos, however, weren't that great. I ordered the Pollo Rojo and Al Pastor Tacos and both of them were lukewarm at best and had soggy tortillas. The meat on each taco was flavorful, but the food temperature and soggy taco shells really threw off the taste. My coworker ordered the Willie salad and enjoyed it, so perhaps it's just that the tacos aren't the greatest. I would definitely return to try their Margaritas.",

We tried Bakersfield for lunch and had two margaritas, chips & salsa, and 3 tacos a piece because we were told the tacos were small but at $4 per taco these were wayyyy tooo small. (Picture attached) the chips and salsa were great! We had the short rib tacos which were delicious... shrimp tacos that only had 3 Shrimp and overloaded with cabbage... the chicken taco had a interesting apple topping but it was okay! We walked out and spent $50 which he felt was way too over priced for tacos and two drinks but again we were on vacation and gave it a try but would prefer more bang for my buck.",

    "text": "I was so excited to hear about this place opening and I was very impressed. It has a very rustic look which I love! And the food is amazing.  I started with the queso which isn't a traditional queso. If you are expecting some typical melty cheese you probably won't like this. It has a consistency similar to hummus. I personally liked it but my friend did not. We also got a red type sauce and verde salsa for dipping. The red sauce has a little bit of a bite to it and it has a very smoky taste. The verde sauce was once of he best verde salsas I've had. It had a lot of flavor which a lot of other places can't seem to master. I also got a traditional margarita which was very good as well and came served in a mason jar!   As for the entree I got a fish taco and a pollo rojo taco. I would highly recommend the pollo taco. It had a nice bite to it but it wasn't overpowering. The fish taco I wasn't a huge fan of because I thought the fish was too thick and it could have used more slaw and less fish.  My second visit I got the pork belly pastor taco which was amazing. We also got the guac and it may have been the best guac I've ever tasted. The perfect amount of like to give it some flavor. I would also like to say how nice the staff is here. I've never been anything less then impressed with the staff. Our server, Dylan, this last visit was awesome. He was very attentive and personable.   Overall I really enjoyed the food here and I definitely plan to go back numerous times.

The Willie Ensalata is a generous portion of salad topped with an assortment of fresh meats and veggies. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the papas tostado was. A vegetarian option which I highly recommend. As far as tacos go, I can say that any of the following would be a good pick for this spot: FISH, BAJA SHRIMP, Pollo ROJO or EL PASTOR. All were served in a handmade tortilla with fresh ingredients.   I have enjoyed the Paloma which is grapefruit cocktail, the Bakersfield margarita and also the Spicy Margarita. The last one does pack a punch so beware anyone who doesn't like spice, this one will get you!",

It is an odd but cool combo of a tequila and Whiskey bar, which is actually an amazing southwest American mashup. The prices are well worth it for the food and service you receive. We stopped in on Cinco de Mayo and enjoyed a Margarita pitcher (64-oz of margarita worth) for 32 bucks. That's an amazing deal and they were perfect! No artificial sour mix here. The guacamole and salsas were some of the best I've had. The chipotle salsa has a kick and I actually started eating it with a fork because it was so good. On top of that, the tacos are unique and well priced for the quality. They are served a la carte so you can mix and match.  The best part of the night was our server CJ. He provided good conversation and amazingly attentive service. Thanks for the great evening!",

I also got fish tacos and pork tacos and they were delicious...everything was so fresh and flavorful. Service was friendly and constantly checking in to make sure everything was okay, and gave us two of their salsas to try which both enhanced the meal as well. They were super kind about splitting the check, which we normally try to avoid when possible but they offered it to us.

The queso with sausage was very good as was the sangria.  I was bummed at the lack of changing table or family restroom. None of the restrooms had even a changing table in it.

Their house made guacamole was the highlight of the meal. So fresh and chunky with tons of lime and came out chilled (yet knew it was being MTO as it was late and our waiter informed us it would take longer than usual). Vegan options are very limited, with only one taco that's essentially black bean spread and guacamole. Lacking the vegetarian/vegan options. However I've heard great reviews on all the various tacos, all of which come loaded with toppings. It's a single taco per order and they are on the small side, so be mindful of that. Fun ambiance. Draws quite the night scene so be expected for crowds on the weekends.",

    "text": "Went in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was originally seated at a communal table downstairs, but opted to sit at the bar. We started with chips and guacamole, the guacamole was quite good. Really fresh and a good balance of ingredients, not overwhelming in any one area. I would definitely recommend it. I got three tacos, pollo rojo, bistec, and short rib. The bistec was ok, the meat was very sweet which is generally not my thing, but if you like that then it's worth a try. The pollo rojo was good, the chicken wasn't dry and was pretty flavorful. However, the True must try is the short rib. The meat was flavorful, soft, and very juicy. The tortillas were fresh and very good. The tacos in general were sort of small, depending on how hungry you are, definitely get three!! They are completely filled to the brim though, and al the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Overall, would definitely go again with a better idea of what is worth it to eat. It's $4 for a taco, which is to be expected for a more upscale taco place.",

The only thing they offer is a shot for $3 that changes daily. Meh. The drink list isn't exciting either. Much better places to drink downtown.  Service was subpar. Most of the waitstaff stands at the hostess bar mingling amongst themselves. I wasn't impressed.  The food. We got the chips and queso. It's a weird texture. Not really much of a sauce consistency....more like melted cheese.  The TACOS - we ordered 4 different tacos at the table. Nobody finished them. Personally I got the Pollo Rojo and the Mole. They were both OK. For a place that's supposed to be authentic, you couldn't tell. Pgh taco truck has better tacos.  The vibe here is cool and hip but this place is definitely over rated.",

The handmade tortillas that accompany each taco were YUM and the taco selection is diverse and interesting - plan to try at least three, maybe four!  We tried the fish, mole, pollo rojo, pork belly pastor, cochinita pibil, bistec and the huitlacoche - look at the online menu for description but trust me on this - all were unique, perfectly prepared, fresh ingredients and so good, you'll want to try more  Two salsas come out, red and green.  The red was smoky - so good and the green was light, fresh - that cilantro flavor that I've come to love.  Both salsas are tasty, tied for the best!!  Loved both.  Rotating draft beers, Mexican sodas and delicious, generous margaritas round out this exceptional dining experience in the cultural district.  The servers, the waitress, and the hostess were all quite personable and attentive.",

I have gone here several times and have been happy. The biggest complaint is the general noise level: it is loud in both seating areas. It makes it difficult to have a quiet conversation as a result.  The crowd is consistently trendy, business casual, young professional, and millennial. The environment is relaxed, but like I said, after people around you have had a few drinks, be prepared to raise your voice to talk to whomever you are with.",

Chips were delicious and seasoned perfectly. I had the short rib taco and the bistec taco. The short rib taco was fantastic - great flavors, the meat was tender and juicy. The bistec taco was okay - the steak marinade was a little too sweet, and there was a disproportionate amount of slaw. Still a good taco, but it didn't live up to the short rib taco.  Overall, this is a great place for a tasty meal",

    "text": "Some friends and I popped in to Bakersfield for lunch recently, undaunted by a Mexican restaurant with the most un-Mexican name ever.  The experience was very hit-or-miss.  The space is inviting, with high ceilings and a large open bar area.  Along the other side of the wall are several picnic-style tables.    The menu is fairly small, with a small selection of appetizers mostly consisting of condiments for tortilla chips, a few tortas, some salads, and a selection of tacos.  We ordered a selection of stuff for our chips, including salsa, guacamole, and queso.  The queso was good, but a bit odd.  It seemed like a bed of mealy cheddar and jack made whipped into a thick roux, covered in a broiled layer of cotija.  It had an odd mouthfeel, and wasn't obviously great, but there was something about it that was compelling.  The salsas were good, including a sweet and spicy salsa verde and a chipotle-laden red salsa.  Most of us really liked both, but the sole Brit in our party thought that the chipotle salsa was bland.  An Englishman calling something bland??  It was good for a few laughs.  The guacamole was superb, with chunks of fresh avocado, and just the right acidity.  Very good.  The tacos are generally pretty decent.  The pork belly is flavorful, thanks to the pineapple, though I was a bit disappointed to find that the fat that makes pork belly so awesome was trimmed, off, and we were left with just cubes of defatted meat.  The fish was amazing, and the cochinita pibil was pretty good.  The misfire was the corn taco, which had a nice zip, but had an odd, almost soggy texture.  Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the service.  Our server was friendly, but the service was painfully slow.  Among the 5 of us, we ordered a pitcher of margaritas and a pint of beer.  All of it took 25 minutes to arrive.  By the time we got our margaritas, our food had arrived.  What a shame, too, since we probably would have ordered another pitcher if the first hadn't taken so long.  Also, the tacos came out on a big pan, with multiple orders on the same pan.  Why couldn't they put them on individual plates instead of forcing us to reach across the table to grab our tacos?  All in all, Bakersfield is decent, but a few things hold it back from being truly excellent.",

Add to that our waiter Jason was awesome! He was funny, friendly, and attentive.   We all shared the salsa, queso, and guac and all were excellent! The salsa verde is very bright and flavorful!The tacos are ala carte and we were told people tend to eat 2-3. After apps, 2 was plenty. My favorite was the fish taco, but the pollo rojo and short rib tacos were also good. The only slightly negative thing is that the corn tortillas used are thicker than avg. Granted, they held up to very full and saucy fillings, but I think I prefer when 2 thinner tortillas are stacked.  There was just something off about the thick tortilla.     We had a variety of margaritas and they were all very good! Not skimpy by any means. Great first experience here!",

Their red salsa is earth shattering, it's magic, it's delicious, it's smoky, it's LIFE. That green salsa? It's tangy, it's cilantro, it's fresh tasting, and it's divine. The chips are house made, and warm, lightly salted crunchy perfection. I purchased the brisket taco and the pork belly taco. I can't begin to describe what a fiesta my mouth was having with both. Perfect amount of sauce, perfect seasoning on the meat. JUST PERFECT.  My co-pilot for the evening got 2 fish tacos which she demolished in a the blink of an eye. I would have asked if they were good but my mouth was having a sexual experience masticating my own tacos. We locked eyes across the table and both nodded.  The margaritas are great, Bakersfield Margarita is awesome... get a whole pitcher, you won't regret this. $3.00 PBR pounders all day everyday. Every day theres a tequila special.   Seriously, if you haven't been to Bakersfield you need to get on it. It's not True mexican, but would you expect it to be? It's good, it's reasonably priced, and you won't regret it. They aren't striving for that True mexican vibe, they play all types of music, the staff is young and hip, they hit the mark all the way.",

    "text": "I have been to Bakersfield twice, both early Saturday in the afternoon and have loved my experience each time. I originally attempted to go on a Friday night when they first opened but the wait was 2 hours- eek! Other than the expected busy times, if you go doing off hours you'll be greeted, seated, and eating right away. I particularly love the eating right away part, knowing you can sit down order and quickly have your food.   The ambience is cool with the wooden walls and Edison bulbs- it's all very trendy right now and the space doesn't disappoint in that regard. I've only sat on the first floor at the high top tables, so I can't comment on the upstairs but the bar is nice and has a lot of seating.   The food is incredible- probably one of my new favorite restaurants in the city. I'm a creature of habit so both visits I had the same thing- queso with no add ins, guac, and the chicken chorizo tostada. First off, the queso is different than you would typically expect both in taste and texture but it's insanely delicious. Just the look of it alone- caramelized cheese in a cast iron skillet- it's enough to make my heart skip a beat.   The guac is INCREDIBLE as other reviewers have mentioned. It's more on the chunky side, often getting whole pieces of avocado  but who'd be mad at that. The flavor is perfect, no lie. I'm not a huge fan of oniony guac and this is far from that so it rates high in my book.   Chicken chorizo tostado is bomb. It's so so spicy but an amazing combination of flavor and spice without being overbearing. The portion size is not huge but after indulging in chips + then eating this I felt perfectly content.   My fiance did get tacos during our first visit and mentioned he wasn't super impressed given the size (they are about 4 inches) and price ($4 a pop) - he referred to them as \"trendy tacos\". Although he said the flavor itself was good, he ate 4 and was still a little hungry so I think if your plan is to get tacos, don't come starving or you might spend to get full.   Yesterday, he had the chicken Milanese torta and was impressed and also left full so that was a win.   Last thing I'll mention is the service, or service of one of the wait staff in particular. Her names was beans, or so she told us to call her that. She was super friendly, great personality, very attentive, and even kicked us a free order of chips and salsa because I mentioned my fiance wanted to leave feeling full. She was also waiting on the tables around us and was engaged in conversation with each. Half the battle in having a good restaurant (outside of the food/cost being good) is having staff that is personable and can provide great customer service. I'm sure we can all agree, it's terrible going out to eat and getting a miserable server. Beans was excellent and seemed like a cool person in general so I definitely hope to visit again and sit with her.",

    "text": "Ton of hype around Bakersfield. A friend from Cincinnati had always raved about how great the tacos/guac are and how the pitchers of margs are fantastic. I went here after work before a Pens game about a month ago, and we decided to go downstairs because they have TVs.  Tacos are great, and the ability to order individual tacos is a huge plus. Chips and salsa are bottomless, and I like the two salsa options I had that day (a verde and chipotle salsa). The house margarita definitely lived up to the hype. I think they do a great job on the margs. Great flavor and you can tell they use quality ingredients.  My only complaint, what is up with the television selections downstairs? I understand they don't have TVs upstairs (at least that's what I've been told, don't take my word for it), but the TVs downstairs were playing some dumb old-timer movie in black and white with no sound... Now I'm not a huge, die-hard Pens fan, but obviously I wanted to watch the game. The bartenders were totally on board with turning off the weird movie, but they still had to ask permission to get the game on. Anyway, thought that was odd. Probably the vibe they're going for, but come on guys, this is Pittsburgh, people want to watch sports at a bar. Maybe that policy has changed since, and I hope that's True.  Overall, I'd definitely go back...I haven't had the famous guac yet.",

I went here for the first time about a week ago for a birthday dinner and fell in love with everything; the atmosphere, the food, and especially our server Jason. He heard it was my birthday so gave me a complimentary shot of the best tequila I'd ever tasted. My friends and I got the guac and queso to start as well as a couple drinks. The queso is different, not what you would expect, but super flavorful and I had a hard time putting it down. We also got one of every taco on the menu and I would have to say the fish and the pollo ones were the best. This place was so delish, that I even went there a few days later! The only downside is the wait..I would definitely recommend downloading the \"no wait\" app before going out, unles youre ok with waiting over an hour to be seated.",

His suggestions were perfect!  I tried the mahi taco (amazing--and I can say that was the first fish tacos I ever tried--in Steel City!), as well as the Baja Shrimp taco, and another Hongos.  All three different flavors, and all superb.  Their salsa verde is wonderful as well.  AND... I'm sure their regular 'Ritas are great, but I ordered Herradura Silver, Cuantro and their homemade mix.  I will not be back in the area for a few months, but I will DEFINITELY come back.  Service, food, drinks, location--wonderful.  Thank you for a great treat.",

Beware of the peppers on top of the queso though. One of them turned out to be really hot!! Following this we ordered some tacos (mole,pollo rojo, hongos (vegetarian), Pork belly pastor). My fiance ordered short rib. The tacos are fairly small in size and each person could eat 2-3 of them. The tostadas were slightly bigger. Our friends ordered Papas and Short rib and some Fish tacos. We also got some wine and and cocktails which were nice. The tacos were juicy and flavorful. It was a nice experience overall.

The guac was fresh and incredible, and actually had a nice amount of spice to it. Same can be said with the tostada and tacos. They were packed with so much flavor, especially the short rib tostada, which melted in your mouth. Margaritas were spot on, and the mason jar sized serving felt about right.

    "text": "In town visiting and decided to give Bakersfield a try on a busy Saturday night. Put our name on the wait list via Yelp (1.5 hours) and took a leisurely stroll over to the restaurant for some pre-meal beverages. We ended up getting a spot to eat in the basement bar and had some of the best food in Pittsburgh. The chips and guacamole came first and was splendid: thin and crisp chips with rich guacamole and some slight heat. Then the tacos: my coworker tried the Cochinita Pibil, the Bistec, and the Short Rib. I tried the Hongos and the Huitlacoche. The flavors of each were rich and complex, some spicy and some refreshing. 2-3 tacos each was more than enough to eat. Highly recommend this place.",

So after a 20 to 25 minute wait to be seated they take us downstairs to be seated, that's strike one for my wife  It was like we were being taken to a dungeon. No windows and no view.  So the waitress comes over after a few minutes, and takes out drink an appetizer order. It took another 20 plus minutes to take our food order strike two.  So my wife notices her playing in her hair and grabs the fruit that goes into my drink and put it in my drink no gloves and no tongs just bare hands.  So I ask her to make me another drink and please don't use her hands to at least use tongs and put the fruit in my drink not her be a hands. She turns around and does the same thing she did first time that's strike three  I'm done. This was our first but last time in Pittsburgh, but when we come to the city again I won't come here ever.",

We had left over chips and they happily brought out salsa for us to finish them off with. Our tacos were amazing. We had pollo rojo, fish and short rib tacos. The owner or manager (I'm not exactly sure who he was) thought one of our tacos was small, so he brought out another for free!! We didn't even notice it was small, but really appreciated his kindness and attention to the quality of his food! Seasonal margarita was awesome, and the prices were excellent.

We sat at a community table with other people we didn't know which was different. We ordered margaritas to start off. I got the premium margarita it was nice strong and not too sweet. I hate when margaritas have more sugary base than the alcohol. This had a perfect mixture. I got two of them. We ended up getting a few tacos. Everything was al la carte but you should order three to get a meals worth. They bring the whole tables food on one tray. I got the shirt rib taco, fish taco, and chicken. I think the short rib was my favorite. They made the tortillas the traditional way similar to how they are in Florida. We also got the guacamole and had salsa on the side. The guac was creamy and my favorite salsa was the verde. Our server was really sweet and funny. She engaged in conversation with us and recommended the best drinks.",

We headed straight down to the basement which was the perfect place for our large group to hang out, drink, and eat appetizers in a trendy yet cozy environment. I ordered a Red Wine Sangria, which was very tasty and particularly potent for sangria. Then, I just had to try the legendary Chips and Queso. I wish that I knew exactly how they make this magical dish. The chips are crispy and homemade, while the queso was gooey and stretchy.... yummmmmm.

If you want good tacos, go to Tako down the street (if you can get in) or Reyna in the Strip District.  What is fantastic are the salads. Bakersfield salads are amazing. Great lettuce, great toppings, great portion, great price. I'm a regular for the salads.  The drinks are good.

    "text": "I tried out Bakersfield with a friend before a recent Yelp event in the cultural district. There was a lot to like, and I definitely think we will be back for apps and drinks in the future. The atmosphere was open and down to earth, and the service was very friendly. The communal table thing wasn't weird at all, since we had nice dining companions. I also loved the classic country/rock songs and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly on tv!   The food was what was somewhat of a miss for me, which prevents this from being more than a 3-star review. The chips and salsa were delicious and reasonably priced, so no complaints there. I know I'll want to get those in the future and maybe next time try the guacamole. The tacos were another story though. My friend had the bistec taco, and it looked fine. He said it wasn't too complex in terms of flavors and rather small for the price, but he did like the steak in it. My al pastor taco was very very dry. There's no other way to say it. The meat was drenched in a promising amount of juice that dripped out of both ends of the taco, but each piece of pork was chewy, hard, and dry on the inside. I ended up removing part of the pork because it was nothing but hard, fatty bits. There was also only as much meat as there was pineapple, and the pineapple is supposed to be a topping rather than the main part of the taco. Being a native Californian I have eaten many pastor tacos in my lifetime (the version tako does so wonderfully is a higher-end example, as well as too many to count from little Mexican places) so I know what to expect from one. Hopefully this was a one-time thing, as I plan on giving the tacos here another try, but given their small size I think a better value can be found elsewhere.  Like I said, we will certainly be back (the PBR boot and $3 shot of the day deal is great!) since the chips, salsa, atmosphere, and service were all very good. The cultural district is a tough place to find reasonable app and drink prices after all. I just won't be making this my go-to taco destination with the other options currently available in the city.",

    "text": "Heads up, Pittsburgh. There's a (relatively) new restaurant in town, and it's downright excellent! I've been here twice, and wish I could stop in more often. Honestly, this is THE place every other taco place needs to beat in my mind right now. That's how much my visits here have impressed me.  My first time here was actually pretty close top opening day - on a Saturday, no less. So the less than ideal time to visit a restaurant, I know. That's when foot traffic is heaviest and, let's be honest, mistakes are most likely to happen. But that visit with a group of friends was honestly fantastic! Aside from a single miscommunication at one point. I was told on the phone when I called the restaurant I could get in line with NoWait before arriving; no such luck - my info wasn't entered into NoWait until after I checked-in in person. A mild inconvenience, but after dining here, one I easily forgave.   Due to the dragging wait time for a table my group and I ended up eating at the bar to ensure we didn't miss our comedy show while waiting for people to clear out. Not that I blame people for wanting to linger as much as they did. This place is lovely - warm, welcoming, and the decor is interesting in that it kind of combines the rustic wooden eatery look with gorgeous modern murals of the city. Plus, the staff are amazing and were incredibly attentive during my first visit, constantly checking on the food and asking if we needed anything - and that was great service seeing as there was a never ending stream of drink and food orders coming in from the bar and dining area that night.  And oh my goodness. The food. I ordered the short rib and veggie tacos, and both were divine. Fresh. Crisp. Tender. Rich in flavor. Shall I go on? I shall not - because I have to save praise for the queso. The thick, creamy queso that makes every other queso eat its heart out. The queso that you can top high with beans, meat and jalapeno pepper. Add prompt rounds of strong and tasty drinks on top of all that flavor and sustenance, and I was a happy diner.   Since then I've been lucky enough to come back and share the Bakersfield experience with a family member. Once again, we left happy and full with good food and strong drinks. Although we did get a giggle from the fact that they were playing country music at the Mexican bar. Go figure. Really my only disappointment is that we weren't hungry enough to split that enormous plate of mouthwatering queso. Next time, Bakersfield. Next time!",

    "text": "I am torn on between 3 and 4 stars for Bakersfield.  The hype behind here has been huge, but this just wasn't the most memorable Mexican.  The service was good, but I just am not as passionate as others about here.  I first tried to come here during a Gallery Crawl and was quoted a three hour wait.  This was perfect, as my friends and I were going to hang out at the Crawl for a few hours and then eat.  Sadly, the line moved slower than expected so we moved on to somewhere else.  However, I came back last week and did get to try it out.  It was my understanding that Bakersfield doesn't take reservations, but I came here for lunch with twelve people and it seems like we must have had one.  I was late so I am not sure.  However, our group fit nicely at one of the communal tables.  Our group used the Seleciones de la casa, which was $15/person for unlimited chips and salsa, chips and queso, chips and gauc, and tacos.  You can only do this for groups of 6-14 people, but it kept the cost down.  This is a great options for big groups and makes the price really reasonable per person.  The actual food was what did not excite me.  I could not stomach the salsa, nor could the four people sitting with me.  The red salsa tastes like a mix of BBQ sauce and tomato sauce, and it was not appetizing.  The queso looked really amazing, and it was very thick and creamy.  It was also very American, however, and didn't resemble anything authentic.  It was a bit more like cheese fondue, and while it was good, there was no hot sauce or anything to give it a kick.  The homemade guac is apparently made every hour, and it was exceptional.  The chips that came with all of these dips were served warm and not salted, which is my favorite.  The tacos are normally $4/taco.  I ordered the short rib and fish tacos.  These tacos are not very big so I would recommend three for lunch and four or five for dinner if that is all you are eating.  The short rib was OK, although the meat was not particularly tender.  I enjoyed the fish much more, although they do use a fish stick for this taco.  I think I would pass on the short rib and just order fish tacos next time.  The standout point of Bakersfield is the service.  Our server was so nice and friendly, and we had an awfully high maintenance group.  The hostesses were lovely on my unsuccessful trip and successful one as well.  I may not love the food here, but don't let that deter you.  Other people seem to enjoy it, and the service is spectacular even if you don't love the food either.",

I ordered a fee tacos & a tostada & ill say i was way more impressed with the tostada. (More food piled on fried tortillas just made for better flavor & texture in my opinion). They have a really nice looking bar & a few good cocktails in the menu. This is a nice place for groups of people, but isn't too loud.",

I first went to the Cincinnati location and was surprised to learn that one existed in PGH.  I had filled up on guac and margs so I never made it to tacos. Both are fantastic, by the way. I eventually got around to our Penn Ave location, so excited to get some tacos, and was totally let down. We tried the al pastor, which was god awful, the fish, the carnitas, and the short rib. The short rib was my favorite. The other two were alright. None were amazing. I do love their guacamole and their margs, and have since discovered the Willie salad which is my new go to and this taco joint.",

Backstory, in 2015 my posse and I were in Nashville for a race and afterwards, we had an amazing meal at Bakersfield.  Great drinks, delicious queso, outstanding tacos, yada yada yada, you get the picture.  Fast forward to 2016 when we are in the 'burgh for a race and as we are casually strolling down Penn Ave, we see \"Bakersfield\"!   It looks similar so we decide to try it out for lunch and found out that it is indeed the newest location of the same place that we loved in Nashville.  So of course we ordered drinks and queso and I had a tostada that was outstanding.  The queso was as good as we remembered and my margarita was very tasty.  Service was fun and friendly and the cost didn't break the bank.  So if someone asks if you should visit Bakersfield, the only appropriate response is \"Yaaassss!\"",

    "text": "I love this place. Each time I've been here (twice) I have had a great experience. Yesterday we came for a fun Friday night out on the town. The wait was 3 hours. LOLZ. Yeah right we said and thought about leaving but then we found a little slab of a table by the bar! Success!! We plopped down with two chairs for two of us and the other two stood. We buckled in to prepared for some fun.  Appetizers: CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE: Yum. The guacamole was very fresh with just a little amount of extras in it. We got it because our waitress said they might be running out and there was no way we wanted to miss this. Some bites had hits of spice to it but nothing overwhelming.  CHIPS AND SALSA: The green salsa was my favorite. The other salsa was red and had a smokier flavor to it. It was good but not as good as that green salsa.   We were munching on chips and decided to order drinks. Since there were four of us we were like, \"why not a pitcher!!\" One person out of the group decided that he would rather have the spicy marg so three of us split the pitcher.   Drinks: SPICY MARGARITA: El Jimador Blanco, triple sec, agave nectar, fresh lemon/lime, fresh fresno/jalapeno. Let me tell you this margarita packed a kick! It was spicy going down and had a spicy after taste too it. Wowie! I would not order this again but if you are adventurous then this is the drink for you!  THE BAKERSFIELD MARGARITA: El Jimador Blanco, triple sec, agave nectar, fresh lemon/lime. I don't like tequila but I liked this drink. It wasn't sweet, like fake syrup sweet, and had just enough tartness to it to make you pucker a bit. I always get mine without the salt rim. They were great. The price was a bit expensive but for three people to split it wasn't bad.   Tacos: (Can I also say these are served in CORN tortillas!!!) FISH: crispy mahi, tabasco lime sauce, citrus slaw, cilantro. Fish tacos are my jam. I love nothing more than a crispy fish taco. This one did not disappoint at all. It was awesome. The fish was a large portion to cover the 4 inch corn tortilla. The slaw was good too! I sometimes add a little bit of the green salsa to this taco. I think that it needs just a little bit more. It is still good as is but I like to spice it up!   MOLE: oaxacan style braised chicken, pickled red onion, queso fresco, cilantro. The pickled red onions are AMAZING. When I come here I ask for a side of them.....Because I love onions and I am crazy like that. This taco had succulent chicken that you need your napkin because the juice will run down your hand! The chicken is juicy and flavorful, a great combination. I would really suggest getting this taco! Yumm...  I would say that if you come here be prepared for either a wait or to sit at the bar. I know that is usually not my favorite thing but the food and service sometimes makes it worth it. I hope that Bakersfield will start allowing reservations, that would be great! But until then: come early, come often, and come hungry!",

Got lucky to get seats at the bar quickly.  We ordered some margaritas.  They were good and the service was good too.  Decided to get some food.  We had the tacos.  The tacos were made on homemade style tortillas, which is always a plus.  Wife tried the chicken (Pollo Rojo), Pork (Cochinita Pibil), and Fish.  I tried the steak (Bistec), Mole, and pork (Al Pastor).  All of them were great, but my favorite was the mole.  It had a nice sauce and coleslaw.  The meat had a lot of flavor as well.  Then we ordered a pitcher (64 oz) of their seasonal margarita.  We got a couple cups with a tangy salt rim, pineapple and lime slices.  The bartender served our first serving.  We enjoyed every last bit of it until it was time to leave.  Tacos are $4 and the first two drinks averaged around $10 each.  The pitcher was a good option at $38, but worth it if you want to stick to one flavor.  Spent around $100 for both of us.  The atmosphere was good.  They had classic cowboy movies playing on the TV's and music at a good level to still have a conversation.  The crowd was late 20's to 30's, with a few older folks, like us.  People were dressed nicely and didn't see any issues all night.  No dancing available.  Great place for Mexican food in Pittsburgh and this is coming from someone who has had tacos in Mexico and East Los Angeles...here are pictures to help out.",

    "text": "I hate to say this, but as a local-ish chain not from the 412, you're walking into some stiff competition in the Pittsburgh market at this point. But I am all for giving every business a chance, especially if you like tacos and tequila!   The name definitely doesn't speak to a Mexican joint, but I don't think they want to be labeled \"authentic Mexican\" by any means. I think they just want to have a casual atmosphere where you can enjoy some good food and drinks.   It's an absolutely beautiful space with a barn chic kinda feel. They have a small bar and picnic tables to dine at. We bellied up to the bar and got the scoop on specials for happy hour. Apparently their schtick is $3 shots of a certain booze that rotates and PBR on draft all night long. Literally from what I saw there were two drafts on tap and then a handful of craft bottled beers. So if you are all about tequila this is your jam, because they have a huge list (as well as whiskey) and various margarita's.   I ordered a marg, and while I did enjoy it, I felt like this one was a little on the sweet side, even after asking to see if it was more sour than sweet. I've had good margs that aren't too sweet, so I know they're out there, I swear!  But the tacos were great! I ordered the fish and short rib. While I liked both, I think the short rib won out among the two. We also ordered guac and it was very good! I loved that it was limey. The avocados could have been cut into a little smaller pieces, because I was basically picking up half the avocado on every chip... but that's not the worst thing in the world, right?  I feel like this place could totally get crazy at night... so I'll be back for a nightcap soon!",

Since they don't take reservations we weren't sure how easy it would be for a party of 6 to get seats - but were pleasantly surprised it was SUPER easy to get seats.    While waiting for our entire party to arrive - we decided to order guacamole, salsa and chips.  Phenomenal choice!  The chips came out warm - the 2 salsa choices (smokey and per our waitress the one so refreshing you'll want to take a bath in it!) were great!  We also decided to get started on the drinks.  Margaritas were appropriately the drink of choice!  There is a great selection of tacos available.  Personally tried the pork belly and bistec.  The pork belly was - hands down - my favorite.  I did take a little bit of the pinapple off as it's not my favorite, but still enjoyed a bit of it.  The bistec - was quite heated - so be aware.  But still quite good.  All the other tacos looked fantastic.  I look forward to trying the others on some additional visits.  I look forward to visiting again soon!",

Really, just another fancy place with decent food and drinks for people to try.  The queso fundido looked better in pics I had seen beforehand.  It was a slightly different version than I'm used to.  Don't know if they use different cheeses.  The pineapple margarita was good but could've been better for a $10 drink. The short rib taco and the salsa is about the only thing I would go back for & not on a busy Saturday.",

This place has an awesome feel to it as soon as you pass the threshold. The bar is dazzling in itself and the bartenders seemed to be wrangling it effortlessly despite the din. I had to, of course, have a margarita in honor of Mexican independence. I asked for the Bakersfield and it did not disappoint. They were handing of sombrero's as you will see in my pics and it was just a lot of fun energy. I ordered a short rib taco and it was excellent, well balanced with queso fresco ( yum). Chips and verde salsa were also dank. Btw chips and tortilla were definitely house made.   I was told there was a downstairs so I proceeded to check it out. It was a complete throng but it could be expected. Great place",

I think a table would have been more practical but I guess this was the best they could have done. Oh well. Just glad we got to sit. My friends ordered a pitcher of Spicy margaritas. It looked good, had hot peppers in them with a wooden spoon to mix. I tried a virgin margarita, prego friendly which was nice! I didn't want to feel left out.  I think my favorite taco is the short rib. The waiter claimed that the fish tacos are the best but I beg to differ. It was alright wish it had a little more flavor. Now that I think of it, try the sauces. They had a smokey salsa and a tomatillo sauce. Darn my prego brain! Overall the tacos are pretty tasty, simple, but small. Prices are decent. I think they make their own tortillas from what the waiter said. The appetizers were really good. I tried the corn dip, queso, and the guacamole. Yummy! They also ran out of tequila. Haha what kind of bar runs out of tequila? But what do I care. I'm pregnant.  I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I ordered some tacos last night through Door Dash. There weren't many options so I decided to try Bakersfield. I typically don't like going to \"Modern Mexican\" places and I assume non Spanish sounding restaurants are just white-washed Spanish restaurants.. Boy! Am I happy I gave this place a chance.  I ordered two tacos- The Hongos & Al Pastor. They were phenomenal. The in house made corn tortillas were wonderful and did not get soggy despite the ample food inside the tacos. The Hongos taco was full of flavor and satisfied me despite not having meat. The portabella mushroom was cooked perfectly and were kinda juicy which helped it blend with the additional toppings.The carnitas were also cooked great with a slight crunch to the outside of the pork. The Al Pastor taco was definitely one of the sweetest I've had so far in life. It wasn't off-putting however, and the sweetness of the meat mixed perfectly with the sweetness of the chopped pineapples that also topped the taco. I love squeezing lime on my tacos and I really appreciated how this restaurant included a small wedge for each taco in the order (a friend also ordered two tacos).  Update: I just came back to Bakersfield for Taco Tuesday. Wow. The restaurant is impressive. The dim lighting creates a fun atmosphere. I came in with a friend at around 10:45-11PM and the place was full. Luckily, we were able to be seated at a table. The tacos were just as good as my first experience. The customer service was also quality. I've tried tacos from Edgars's and Casa Reyna. The tacos from Bakersfield tastes the best to me by far.",

I admit, when they told me the name, I was surprised it was a taco pub, but whatev.   It was super packed but we got a table right away. It's a very spacious restaurant.   We started with the loaded queso and guacamole. Both were delicious. The queso was a little salty but still pretty good. We demolished it. I didn't get to take a picture of it. I didn't understand why they kept bringing us chips and we were out of apps. They don't give you free salsa (downer), so there's nothing to eat them with. Who just wants chips only?!!?!?  We ordered an array of tacos. I ordered the salmon shrimp and fish. They were DELICIOUS. I was surprised because I never enjoy the food much in Pittsburgh (sorry, we set high expectations being from Chicago). My tacos had a little heat but not enough spice to take over and ruin the taste of the food so I appreciated that. The shrimp and fish were both fried and they were fried perfectly. They weren't greasy or greasy tasting. Both meats were seasoned very well. The tortillas held together. They didn't do much, they were just there. The fish had a citrus slaw that made it quite refreshing and tasteful. The slaw was also fresh and crunchy. Same for the shrimp, except they had a red cabbage on top. The fish and veggies were fresh...delicious.   Everyone else ordered: al pastor, huitlacoche, carnitas, and short rib. They all loved their food. The person who ordered the huitlacoche did say her food was decent but too spicy for her to deal with (I saw other Yelpers say the same).   Bakersfield was pretty darn good. Give them a try because I know I'll be back whenever I'm in town again.",

Not a huge dining room area, and for a Friday night we walked right in and got a high top table. Initial thoughts, super noisy.. and I mean LOUD in a sense that we had to yell across the table to talk to each other.   I was a huge fan of the guacamole. Nice size portion, not very expensive (I'm thinking less than $5 for chips and guac)   Drinks - almost $12-$13 for most margaritas. Small glasses. My pineapple margarita was delicious though so I can't complain about that.   Tacos, very limited menu which I wasn't too happy about. Again, comparing to Condado where you can put EVERYTHING under the sun on your tacos and it's still relatively inexpensive.   When the tacos came out they were smaller than I expected but surprisingly tasty. Unfortunately, I ordered the Mahi tacos and I thought they were the worst thing I've ever had. I am a pescetarian so i am always ordering fish/seafood on the menu. Mahi is one of my favorite foods. Not this night though!  The shrimp tacos were pretty good though, and I would order those again.",

If you're like me, you may be thrown off by the interior, very nice, however, you would never assume this place specializes in Mexican cuisine.   We were sat quickly--but things went sort of downhill from there. We sat for a little over 5 minutes before someone came over to us. It was the bartender, who was very sweet. She let us know that she wasn't our server, but would be taking our drink orders for us and our server would be with us shortly. She brought us our drinks. We continued to sit for another 5 minutes or so. The bartender then came back to us, and said our server asked her to take our orders. We thought this was a bit odd. Nevertheless, we placed our orders with the nice bartender. As we waited for our food... we have no water.. no silverware and no napkins. I notice, the table next to us, a party of about 8 are getting waters, orders taken .. etc.. all by the person who was supposed to be out waitress. It was interesting to me how a party of 8 got waters, and silverware within minutes of sitting down.. but a party of 2 was never even acknowledged by the server.   Once the food came out, our \"server\" asked us how things were and we had to ask for silverware to eat the food and water... she never introduced herself or really did anything servers usually do. The food was okay. The queso dip was good, I've had better tacos. The tortilla had a weird taste.   I'm not a local, so the chances of my returning are None.. however, given the service was barely received.. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It seemed odd that our server was able to be attentive and apt to serve a large party, but delegated the bartender to help us. I won't speculate any further.",

You almost feel like you are in one of those hole in the wall bars in Central America in the downstairs. I've been here for drinks and now for the food too.  They make their own Margarita mix daily - and it does not disappoint. I've had their house margarita both times I've been, but they have some other margaritas on the menu too (including a spicy one)!   They make their own salsa too! It's a rather smooth salsa - they make a roja and a verde. Typically, I prefer a chunky salsa but the flavors made up for the lack of chunks.   If the marg mix and salsa isn't enough - they also make all their own tortillas?! WOW!  This visit I had the Willie salad. I am not typically a salad type of girl, especially when there's tacos around but I ate too many chips for tacos! The Willie is the most perfect salad - it had all the making of a good taco, but in a chopped salad and tossed in a light ranch style dressing. Don't miss it!",

Everything was delicious and well flavored. Tacos are average size so expect to order 3-4 to fill you up.  We shared the pineapple margarita pitcher and it was strong. Highly recommend this spot to enjoy some authentic tacos and some drinks with friends.",

My boyfriend ordered the Milanesa and the quality of the chicken was good. He shared a bite with me and it was pretty tasty.

It can get a bit crowded down there as does any bar in the cultural district on nights and weekends, but for the most part it's still a fun vibe.   Since my initial dining experience I've tried the short rib queso which is leaps and bounds better than the original. The guac was also on point, I just wish they gave you more of it for the mountain of chips it comes with.   Drinks here are always solid and they usually have a fun assortment of craft drafts/cans/bottles. The $3 shot of the day is a steal, too. Come here if you want to grab drinks and chat with friends in a fun spot downtown. Parking is a joke, so Uber or use public transit if you can :)",

    "text": "Came here before going to NYC and wanted to grab a bite with some friends.   We first ordered a pitcher of margaritas for the table, it tasted great and strong. And we asked the waiter a simple question if we could build our own tacos here (we've never been to Bakersfield before), the waiter gave us the worst attitude and said \"if you want to build your own tacos, you can leave to condados\" and left our table. We were a little shook by the attitude he gave us, but we just said let's try it here since some of us tried condados before.  We ordered the short rib queso for the table to share, it was very flavorful. we then all got all random tacos. I got the short rib, steak, and el pastor tacos. They all were pretty good, nothing that special but good.  At the end of our meal, the waiter was no where to be found and we were in a hurry to leave. We asked the the hostess in the front to find our waiter and she responded \"I'm just here to work in the front\" but she eventually went and found our waiter after one of my friends got an attitude back with her. The waiter care by and gave us an attitude when we wanted to split the checks 4 ways. He came back lastly with the checks split and left without saying much back.  Overall, food was good but nothing to really talk about. But the service was god awful, i will never come back here due to the service we had received and the prices were a little higher than most places I've went to. I am only giving an additional star since the food was good.",

The dining room isn't huge, so it does fill up rather quickly. I like it here.  I've been here a few times, as I work just around the corner, and will stop by for a beer after work. The prices are decent, they have a shot-of-the day special each night, I think. They seem to specialize in tequila, although there's a decent selection overall to choose from. It is a full bar, after all.  The food is mostly tacos, tex-mex, etc...The chips and guacamole are good, and the selection of tacos should satisfy just about anyone's tastes. From chicken, to fish tacos, to pork belly, to mushroom veggie tacos, there's a wide range of different flavors and ingredients available to order.  If interested in trying this place, try lunch sometime, as evenings can and do get crowded pretty quick. Still, it might be worth the wait.",

We were a little late for the lunch rush, so we got to talk a little more with our server who was just lovely.  She talked to us about the different margaritas and we ended up going with the Premium Margaritas and they were delightful.  Nothing better than a margarita that doesn't come from a mix!  The guacamole and salsas were fantastic, and we each had two tacos to round out the meal.  I went with the fish taco and short rib taco and neither one left me feeling disappointed.  Overall the food was great, our server was even better, and the only downside would be that I could imagine it gets VERY loud during prime dining hours.  But if you're looking for an alternative to a sandwich spot for lunch, definitely check out Bakersfield, it was exacty what we were looking for!",

The margarita had a little extra kick to it and hit the spot. Now onto the food. The tacos were amazing and probably the freshest mexican food i ever had. Taste like something a top notch chef handcrafted himself. Only big negative was the price was a little pricey for the taco portions. 4 bucks a piece for some small type tacos that will leave you hungry still after eating 3 of them. My suggestion is to have to tacos come in a meal format as well with rice, beans, or chips to help satisfy the hunger!   But yes this place is worth a checkout if ur a die hard mexican food lover looking for something different of higher quality. Just don't go there really hungry as it will take a lot of purchases $$$ fill u up. And this is coming from a fairly small guy that doesn't eat large portion meals to begin with.",

The atmosphere is very rustic with Western movies playing on the TVs.    We split an order of chips and salsa, while I ordered the chicken chipotle tostada and mole taco and Jenn ordered the short rib torta and pork belly pastor taco.  The two house salsas -one red, one green - were excellent and I liked how I could use as much as I wanted.  The green salsa had come with our chips so I kept refilling it.  The chicken chipotle tostada is a meal in itself and was amazing with the red salsa.  The mole taco also had a good amount of flavor.  Jenn's short rib torta was also good.  She wasn't expecting it to be as big as it was and actually ended up taking half of it home.  The pork belly taco was good, as well.        The price point is right here.  Every food item on the menu is under $10.  I spent about $25 for a decent amount of food AND a sangria.  My word.  Try doing that almost anywhere else in town that's not a pizza joint.  We'll be back...tomorrow, actually.",

I have been there several times previously, during week hours, and wanted to bring my family.  We were greeted and seated by our friendly and competent waiter 'Chris', who provided stellar service throughout the meal.  Our table ordered chips and guacamole to start. Guac was super fresh and very tasty. Next came the meal. Bakersfield tacos are small, but priced accordingly which is great because you can try a variety. I had a fish and also a pollo taco, both were outstanding - very fresh and delicious. My wife and I also tried some soup for the first time. It was called Pozole, and I highly recommend it. It had braised pork, chicken, In a tomatillo broth with hominy dumplings. Complex and tasty flavors.  Atomsphere at Bakersfield is also nice. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food. Lots of liquor offerings and music was pleasant.  Definitely recommend.",

Food - I ordered bistec, fish and one of the chicken tacos (not the mole, but can't remember what it was called). Bistec was a bit gummy to my taste but flavor was good.  The fish tacos tasted like frozen Long John Silvers fish, so I was pretty disappointed in that. The chicken tacos were excellent. The guacamole was on the garlicy side, but I loved it.   Ambiance - Aside from the sweet specials menu, the first thing I noticed was the funky smell. It was a bit off-putting as the first impression.  While waiting for our table, we went downstairs to the lesser crowded bar. The scene was chill and it wasn't as loud as it was upstairs. The upstairs area music is extremely loud so everyone has to tell to have a conversation making it that much louder. I would recommend to the staff to turn the music down a few notches.   Drinks - drinks were great, although I refrained from doing any of the shot specials, I was tempted. I stuck with the jalapeno Marg all night. It was delicious.   Staff - staff was well informed, courteous and helpful. They did great with our party of 4.",

    "text": "We went here last night for a bachelorette party! Party of 13. The staff was overly accommodating and it looked like they have a great team approach as we saw many wonderful servers stop at our table. Liz was our waitress and was fantastic. Super helpful and on top of her game!   Being that our party was so large we got the $15 per person special where they bring apps, salads and a combo of their 5 top selling tacos out until you basically stay stop. if up have a large party this is the way to go.  Chips and salsa, query for our apps. The chips are really good, quad very fresh and big chunks of avocado. The green salsa was my favorite. The reddish brown had a more smoky taste to it. We hot the Johnny salad which was also delicious. Nice mix of tastes.   The tacos were... Fish, chicken, pot belly, beef and I think the portobello mushroom. If you like spicy, the chicken is the way to go. The fish taco was probably my favorite because it has a nice taste to it. However, the braised beef and pot belly weren't too far behind. Didn't try the portobello, but heard it was also great.  Awesome experience. The 3.00 tequila shots were also delicious! I will be back",

    "text": "3.5 stars, rounding up to four. Hooray for fresh, gourmet tacos at Bakersfield! I went for dinner with my aunt on a Monday night and was thrilled to be seated right away without waiting--always a plus when my stomach is rumbling. We were right up on top of the people next to us (shared booth on one side), but that is pretty normal for small downtown restaurant spaces. Fine for a casual taco dinner, maybe not the best choice for a date night. Our server (I think his name was Josh) took a while to come over to us, so we were already ready to order our tacos along with the drinks. I asked for water and he kept pressuring me to try a margarita or glass of wine, which I thought was wildly inappropriate. I was just headed to the gym after and abstaining from alcohol at dinner, but what if I was a recovering alcoholic? This reflects more on the server than the restaurant, but it's worth noting in training that you don't question a guest's choice unless they ask for your opinion. We also tried ordering the tacos and he ignored us at first, trying to upsell an appetizer. No, I just want my tacos, thank you very much!   After ordering, the tacos came out fairly quickly (about 10-15 min) and were presented beautifully. I had the pork belly, chicken, short rib and fish (mahi mahi) tacos and thought they were all good, but really enjoyed the fish the most and give it 10/10--lightly battered, but not greasy, with just the right amount of acidity and tang. The chicken was my least favorite, as it tasted sort of like crockpot chicken I make at home. The girl who ran the food to the table was super helpful, cheerfully describing each taco and refilling our drinks.   I will definitely go back, have more tacos and try some guacamole and/or queso, but I am not completely enamored by Bakersfield. Solid and good, but not what dreams are made of.",

Maybe it's because I'm old but that's just the vibe I picked up. Oh, and the fact that your PBR is served in a glass boot. That, to me, screams hipster. Look, I'm not gonna judge, although my good taste says I'm entitled to do just that, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a single thing I would drink out of a glass cowboy boot. Certainly not PBR. Would never drink that. Enough said about that.   The bar is great. The shot of the day is a great feature and the margaritas looked good. The whiskey/bourbon menu was impressive as well. I went with beer cause I was gonna be drinking later. Hey, it was a Saturday afternoon! Attentive bartender was a plus.   The food? Here's where I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. The guacamole is as good as everyone says. Really good with just the right amount of cilantro and lime with chunks of fresh avocado. I'd order this every time. The tacos? I've had better in quite a few places around town. Granted they are not skimpy and their presentation is nice. We ordered four different ones and I'd say that 2 were really good and the other 2 just ok. The good? The cochinita pibil and the short rib. The others were the pork belly pastor and the pollo rojo. Just wasn't enough flavor there. Plus the tacos are served on a single tortilla and the juiciness causes the tacos to fall apart. Could be messy.   Would I come back? Absolutely. That's why I'm rounding up to 4 stars. But I'm coming for the guacamole and to try something else on the menu.",

Super trendy with a classier vibe yet I won't feel out of place dining in jeans and a tee. It was actually very reminiscent of Tako, a restaurant few blocks over.    If you only come for one thing, get the chips and guac! Best guac I've had in my life (seriously!). It's made in-house and prepared fresh every thirty minutes. Ah-mazing!  Highly recommend the Papas Tostada for anyone looking for a meatless option. It's a crispy tortilla on a bed of shredded lettuce that is piled with black beans, crispy potatoes, salsa, guac, and poblano. For only $7, I was expecting a smaller portion, but the tostada filled even my black hole of a stomach. So delicious I wanted to cry.   Service was phenomenal from start to finish. We were seated immediately as we entered, and our waitress was very bubbly and friendly. She gave many good tips about what to select off the menu and pointed out the best vegetarian options. Although we came during the lunch rush, the food came out pretty quickly.   There you have it. Fantastic food, great ambiance, stellar customer service. Bakersfield's got the whole package and my stamp of approval. I will be back soon for those tacos!",

    "text": "Came here as a party of 11 and I made a booking, which would highly recommend as it got busy. So there were some misses with this place for me, service and ambiance wise, which is why it's not a full 5-stars. Our server messed up some orders, drinks were a looong time coming (and some didn't come at all until our server was reminded again and again!)  For drinks, I got the House Sangria. It was actually quite good, but I wanted more fruit and especially more pieces of the baby mandarin in my drink. I also took a sip of the spicy margarita that a co-diner order and gosh dang it - that was way too spicy for me as it incorporated freshly chopped jalapeno!! You have been warned!!!!   I also ordered an entree of corn chips and salsa - asked for the red sauce (thanks to Yelper Bradford M for that tip). When it came out, it had the green salsa which I definitely did not like as it had a weird aftertaste. I also didn't really enjoy the red one which was too smoky for my palate. Both the salsas had a sort of heavy bitterness which turned me off.   However the saving grace from an appetizer point of view was the Queso dip. Now I will admit that I did not want to order this dip because seeing the yelp pictures it felt like it was going to be that fake plastic cheese that you seem to get  in most American restaurants, so I was pleasantly surprised by this Queso dip which was fresh and bursting with a great medley of flavors. I would absolutely recommend getting this for an appetizer.  For my taco variety, I decided to get the following: -Pork belly pastor: this is the one I was most excited to try but the fact that the pork belly was cut up into small pieces meant that some pieces had too much fat and some pieces had too much chewy belly. I also wasn't of a huge fan of the seasoning. Ranked #2 for me.  - Cochinita pibil: absolutely my favorite of the night and I almost didn't get its as it was an afterthought! That achiote braised pork was AMAZING!! Spicy taste, tender pork, perfect medley of flavours. Ranked #1 for me.  - Hongos: I love me some mushrooms and the thought of them in a taco I thought would be perfect. However this turned out to be a major disappointment. Similar to the pork belly, the portobello mushroom was chopped up into small pieces which made it difficult to eat and pieces of the mushroom kept falling onto my plate. I also thought the variety of mushroom used with the corn tortilla were just not compatible and in the end, I left the corn tortilla on my plate and just ate the portobello mushroom pieces with some chips. Ranked #3 for me.  Btw, a lot of my co-diners heavily praised the Short Rib Tostadas, but I didn't taste so can't comment. Also for a table of 11 that wanted to talk, the music was super loud and so conversations were mostly with folks sitting next to you. Frankly I'd only ever come here again if I didn't want to speak to my co-diners....   Note: #326 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016",

The torta was one of the stars of the meal with hearty crisped bread, tender pulled pork, and a nice red salsa which added smokiness with a hint of heat and tang to eat bite. It's about the size of hefty panini so one or two more tacos will easily push you to fullness. The tacos themselves were all quite good with perfectly-cooked meats and well-balanced flavors. The short rib was the best all-around taco given its classic savory goodness but the cochinita pibil stood out for its ability to blend complex flavors with a hefty hit of heat that doesn't melt your face but truly adds to the experience of dish. I'd also recommend a pastor taco to end your meal as the generous pineapple chunks make for a naturally sweet dessert-like finish. The most boring taco was the chicken which I probably wouldn't get again. The two other quibbles I had are that the pineapples of the pastor clearly tasted canned and the tortillas had an odd slick and mealy texture which was a little off-putting compared to the steamed or fried corn tortillas you get at other places.  Overall, however, my wife and I had a very enjoyable meal at Bakersfield and would gladly come again. This place is much more laid back and traditional which we enjoy whereas Tako nearby offers a more trendy avant-garde experience that, while fun, seems more a young person's game.",

There is seating at the bar, as well as at the tables.  By the way, I had no idea this place is a chain. It is a great chain restaurant!   We started off with guac and chips- I love my guac and they did a good job.  This is what I ate: Short Rib Tostada: Huge portion, comes on a bed of lettuce leaves. The short rib came with a fried egg, on top of a crispy tostada. Fish Taco: The fried mahi mahi in the taco was good Al Pastor Taco: Delicious pork taco!  They put everyone's taco on a huge plate in the middle of the table. Although the waitress did tell us what the different tacos were, we had so many that it was hard to remember whose was whose.   Overall, great place for taco.. Monday, and tostada... Monday!",

Our waitress was also helpful in making sure we understood the portion sizes for the tacos I landed on the steak taco it was good but a little over seasoned.   My drink was really good I got the Bakersfield sour it was really really good. Our waitress suggested the watermelon martini which we both decided to get it unfortunately I didn't really like it it was a little too sweet for my taste however my fiance insisted on getting some Queso. I really don't like cheese as it doesn't sit well in my tummy, usually. however when they bought the Queso  out I did enjoy some of the chips and let me tell you they have the best Queso that I have ever had in my life. The guacamole came out and it was really really fresh I usually eat a little. Of th appetizer to ensure that I save room. But I couldn't stop with the guacamole it was sooooooo good.   The environment was great the bartender was very nice In fact  we started at the bar before we got seats and the as soon as we sat down she asked what we would like! She seemed impressed when I ordered my drink:-) if in the are we will back.",

If I go back I will be trying something different since I didn't love the tacos.  Well what you see above is my review from 2 months ago. I went back for lunch today and liked my order much better. I ordered the chicken chorizo tostada and my husband ordered the short rib torta. Both were really good. I of course had to order the queso dip again since I liked it so much the first time.

    "text": "Wait, Bakersfield is a chain? Wow, I had no idea until I browsed some of these reviews just now. Crazy. It definitely doesn't have a chainy vibe...it feels like a local, hip, modern Pittsburgh joint.   We recently came here with some friends on a Saturday night. We got there rather early...just shy of 6:00....and we were able to get a table with relative ease. As the evening went on though, it grew more and more crowded, so be prepared to wait for a table if you come during prime dinner hours. As I mentioned, the vibe of this place is very trendy, but not in an unwelcoming or intimidating way.   First, the booze. Get the margarita! I don't always love margaritas...sometimes they're too sour, sometimes they're sickeningly sweet, sometimes they taste like nothing but tequila. The Bakersfield margarita was my goldilocks margarita...perfect balance of everything. And strong too, so at $8, it was a good value.  Next, the food. To start, we got chips and guac and chips and queso. I'm not a guac eater, but the rest of my dining companions reported that it was some of the most fresh, tasty guacamole they've ever had. So thumbs up for the guac. As for the queso, you can add goodies to it if you're so inclined (black beans, chorizo, etc.), but we opted to order it plain. It had amazing flavor, but it was definitely different from typical queso served at Mexican restaurants. It had a somewhat pasty, grainy texture...kinda similar to hummus. My friend said the texture reminded him of a thick bisque. So queso purists might be turned off by the unusual texture, but it was delicious regardless....I mean, let's be real, it's a bowl of hot cheese, so how could it *not* be delicious?   As for the tacos, they received high marks from our group as well. I sampled the pollo rojo and huitlacoche. The pollo rojo was divine...the chicken, spicy salsa, chipotle lime crema, and cilantro all combined for one hell of a delicious bite. I was less of a fan of the huitlacoche...it tasted a bit too grassy for my liking (I guess the technical foodie term would be \"earthy,\" but I still maintain that it tasted kinda like grass :) As for my friends, the hands down favorites for them were the fish taco and the bistec taco (made with short rib, slaw, cilantro). Note that the tacos here are kinda small....usually at any taco joint, two tacos is more than enough to fill me up, particularly if there are appetizers involved. But even with having chips and guac/queso and then two tacos each, everyone at my table ended up ordering a third taco after.   Our server was Dylan and he was fun, friendly, and attentive. Our food came out fast. Overall, it was a great night out and I think this will become one of our dining staples when we're downtown. Cheers!",

When he asked where I wanted a gift card that he could purchase from Ohio, I immediately thought of here... mayyyyybe with a chance that I'd be able to convince my husband to come again.  Once again, the food did not disappoint on my end. The only difference is that my husband decided to try some of their actual tacos and this time he was pretty pleased. Service was great, even to my four year old. I will say that with the high top tables, this place could be a little challenging with little ones, but she did well and seemed to like her chicken taco once we received cheese to put on it. I loved the portobello and short rib tacos, so in our hiatus from coming I had to get those again. We also devoured their shrimp tacos and they have become a new favorite for both of us. The Trio appetizer had a little something for each of us and I could not stop myself from eating nearly all the guac.   I am happy to say that he's been converted into a Bakersfield fan and that I'll happily be accepting gift cards from anyone who wants to send em my way! Looking forward to getting back there again soon.",

    "text": "Cool place to grab tacos and hangout with friends and coworkers. Service is friendly and accommodating.   Note - I'm a spicy-sensitive person, so I checked with our server prior to ordering to see which tacos were spicy, and if so, could they leave out whatever component that was hot. The server just mentioned that the shrimp was more spicy than usual that day, so he could leave the sauce on the side.   Unfortunately, two other of my tacos turned out to be spicy :( So a headsup to check with your server but also avoid the following noted spicy tacos in case you're also sensitive.   Carnitas $4 Juicy marinated pork, but spicy! Definitely wasn't prepared for the tingle. Comes with a dab of guac, sliced jicama, pickled red onions, tomatillo cream, and cilantro.  Shrimp $4 Sauce is spicy but you can ask for them to leave it off. Each taco comes with 3 large fried shrimps that are delicious. I didn't realize mine was missing guac until I looked at the menu again later on,  Bisteca $4 Love the meat! Tender and succulent cubes of steak. The slaw that it's topped with though is spicy... The kind of spicy that throws fire on your tongue and burns down your throat. I'm not quite sure if the meat itself was also marinated in a spicy sauce or if it was the coleslaw sauce that seeped through.   Short Rib $4 Yumm. This was probably the only taco I didn't have issues with in terms of unexpected spiciness. Comes with queso fresca, crema, pickled white onions, radish, cilantro. Delicious!   The tacos all come on a thick house-made corn tortilla. Slightly sweet. You can taste the real corn grains used.  Nice place to try the tacos. 3 tacos are probably enough as a meal for an average hungry person :)",

I had the short rib taco and while it was good, it certainly was not anything to run to tell mom about. Same with the queso, the cast iron pan was filled so shallow I'm surprised my chip didn't break in half touching the surface.   This place is fine to grab a few drinks at but don't come here hungry or you'll be breaking the bank. Condado's is much better just a few blocks down the road and their tacos are quite literally double the size.",

My first was a cocktail with tequila and the second was a respasado tequila served on the rocks. I enjoyed the drinks. They have a good selection of tequilas.  For dinner, I ordered the shrimp, corn truffle, and chicken tacos. The corn tortillas were awesome. They had a grainy texture and had a homemade feel to them.

    "text": "OK.  So the first time I went to this establishment was in Columbus OH ... and it was incredible.  So the bar was set high, and the Pittsburgh site did not disappoint.    This place has some of the best tacos you will ever have.  My absolute favorite was the Short Rib.  First of all, the taco shell was made fresh ... soft, pliable, tasty, and did not fall apart.  Why is this important?  Because the fillings are huge and juicy.  And the Short Rib was especially tender.  Of course, let me not forget about the chips and salsa.  I know there are many varieties out there, but again, this place does this to the next level.  They offer two sauces ... red and green.   Although the sauces have been somewhat emulsified, there is still a good body to them to stick to the chip ... and the flavors are incredible!  The only thing that throws me is the name.  It does not shout out Taqueria.  I tried to find the story behind the name, but did not.  To the Management ... Please consider a spot in Northern Virginia.  Although it seems you like to position your locations in cities, go do your research on Tyson's Corner.",

I like the cochinita pibil and the Baja shrimp the most, but you really can't go wrong with any of the options. The tacos are just small enough to allow yourself to order 4-5 as a meal, but large enough that you really get a True sense of what each one is like. Nice atmosphere as well.  The reasons I give it 4 stars are because the service was slower than I would've liked and the draft beer I ordered came in a tiny little boot mug that made it look like a single beer in a flight rather than a regular beer.  Overall, the Tuesday special and the atmosphere make it a great place to try some different tacos",

We called the morning of and dropped off a cake so they could bring it out at the end of dinner and the staff was very accommodating. Our waiter cut the cake up into 9 equal pieces for us!   I ordered the Baja Shrimp, the Pollo Asado, and the Huitlacoche taco. All three were delicious. The Baja Shrimp was my personal favorite. The cabbage slaw and peppers on top were delicious. The huitlacoche taco was also very good but I would have liked more filling! The homemade tortillas were very good, but could have been a little bit warmer and crispier.   We ordered chips and guac and loaded queso before we ordered our tacos, but there was some issue in the kitchen and our tacos came out before the guac and queso. We got the guac and queso after we had already finished all of our tacos, but even so it was absolutely delicious. The guac was very lime-y, which I prefer, and the queso was fantastic. The margaritas were awesome! Both the classic lime margarita and the pineapple margarita were delicious.   Our waiter was extremely nice and apologetic, and I am sure that the minor hiccups we experienced with our food coming out were just a one-time thing, and I know that as such a large group we were difficult to accommodate.   I would definitely come back here and recommend this place. The atmosphere was great for a group and a fun place to go for a birthday celebration!",

The restaurant was slightly busy as we came in around 1:00. Our server was super awesome - attentive, nice, friendly, and even gave us recommendations on what to eat and what to do in Pittsburgh.   We ordered and split the Trio as an appetizer (chips, guacamole that was super fresh, and two different kinds of salsas). Chips were refillable too so we were able to make use of all the guac and salsas they gave us!  I ordered the Milanesa torta which was tasty and good, especially with the salsas and guac that I ordered as an appetizer.  I would recommend this place if you're in the downtown Pittsburgh area. We even recommended this place go other people that were attending the conference too and they all enjoyed it!",

It's especially nice on summer days when they have the window seating available.    For food here I always start off with the queso, which is not your typical white cheese Mexican queso.  It is more like a cheese dip than queso, but it is so good!  You can add chorizo or short rib to it which is a nice touch as well.  They also have really good regular and verde salsas.  I have had most of their tacos and they are really good.  I am more of a flour tortilla fan, but their corn shells have a good taste and go well with the toppings and meats they use.  The fish and chicken tacos are my two favorites.  The best thing to get here in my opinion is the milanesa torta.  All of the workers told me it was a staff favorite.  I also saw other yelpers raving about it.  It is essentially a chicken sandwich, with some Mexican ingredients.  However, despite its simplicity, the flavors all go together perfectly, creating an amazing taste.  The torta comes with chicken cutlet, black beans, salsa verde, arugula, avocado lemon mayo.  The chicken is fried to perfection and pairs great with the fresh torta.  The lemon mayo balances out the crispy fried chicken in such an incredible way.  The sandwich is just perfect.   Can't wait to stop back!",

It seemed like those of us who ordered the Selections of the House ($15/person for a sampling of almost the entire menu) were very pleased. Those who didn't were not pleased. I was among the \"House\" people and I LOVED it. For $15 we were given hearty portions of chips, guac, queso (with a delightful crisped cheese top), a pretty amazing salad, and a variety of tacos including veggie, pork belly, chicken and short ribs. We were all so stuffed, I had leftovers to take home. I also thought our server, JB, was a delight. Those who ordered a la carte seemed a bit disappointed with their meals, and had some concerns over drink mistakes, etc. In addition, it did take us a full 3 hours to get in and out - something to keep in mind if you have time constraints. I would definitely love to go back, but will always come en masse, so that I can take advantage of the Selections menu (for parties of 6+). Thanks, Bakersfield, for an awesome birthday outing!",

We ordered chips and salsa to share, and I was surprised by the amount of chips.  I feel like in a lot of places they don't serve as many as they did here.  We tried both of the salsas, my friend liked the green but I preferred the red.  It had a much smokier taste & I'm a fan of that.  I ordered the bistec taco and it was incredibly good!  I also had a bite of my friend's fish taco, and next time I think I will order one for myself.    For drinks, we just ordered a few beers.  I thought it was very cute that they served the beer in mini 16-oz boots.  It's not something you see in a lot of places & it made drinking beer a little more fun.  But next time I plan on trying a margarita, I watched the bartender make a few and they looked delicious!  Bakersfield is a nice addition to the cultural district, it's nothing fancy but it has a fun atmosphere and the food and drinks are great!  I'll definitely be going back soon.",

    "text": "Truly wonderful experience.   The bar was crowded when we arrived, as sitting there would have been our preference. But no worries- they had a table for three available without a wait.   Picnic table seating was cool. Lots of room especially for three.   Ashley, our server was really good. She knew what she was talking about, was available when we needed her to be, but not annoying.   Food was great. We had the chips and guacamole to start. Chips seemed homemade and were wonderful. Guacamole was certainly homemade- a little spicy (I loved, the girls were less fond), creamy, delicious.   I ordered two tacos- a short rib and a bistec. Both were supreme.   Add the creme- totally worth the dollar. I also added habanero hot sauce- it was a little thin but really good.   Cocktails- they feature whiskey and tequila- I went with the former. Had a couple of old fashioneds- they weren't spectacular but good enough.   Overall I loved the place. Cool atmosphere, great drink selection and very good food.   I wouldn't try to go here as a family- but great for a night out with friends or as a couple.",

    "text": "We went here last Saturday night for a birthday celebration and had a fantastic evening and dinner.  Glad we made reservations as we had a big party of 12 and this place was hoping!  Our table was not ready when we got there-no big deal but the manager came out and apologized and got us seated as quickly as they could. Our waiter was fantastic and quickly took our drink orders. I went with the red sangria which I highly recommend.  The cocktails are a bit pricey but the beer is reasonably priced. Since we had the larger group most of us went with the $15 special which comes with a sampling of appetizers and tacos. It is a great deal that I highly recommend for larger groups-you get a ton of food.  For starters we were brought out chips with queso, guacamole and two types of salsas.  Their red salsa has a pleasant smoky flavor that I was digging.  Also some of the best queso I have tried.  Next up we got their house salad which comes with bacon, onion, avocado and a fantastic dressing-I could not get enough. For our tacos they brought us out the veggie (grilled mushroom), fish, pork, and chicken.  I tried the chicken and pork which were fantastic all with fresh ingredients.  The veggie was not my favorite but what can I say I love the meats! The prices are reasonable with fresh ingredients and a great atmosphere.",

    "text": "It doesn't matter how tasty the tacos are, how delicious the salsa is, how satisfying the drinks are, and how good the prices are if the STAFF SUCKS. Yes, dear manager and owner, that is enough to ruin any establishment. The waitress, Rachel, was unfriendly and rude until my gay friend showed up who she must have liked because then her attitude completely changed. So sorry if we weren't ready to order drinks and food the minute we sat down. And, whoever the absolutely rude hostess was everyone else made kick us out is completely unacceptable. I too am in the service industry and promise you being friendly with a group is going to get you way farther than being rude. Sure your line- \"we have another party for this table, like now\" said in the bitchiest possible tone is one way to get a party out but trying something like, \"I'm sorry we have another party that's been waiting 30 minutes for this table\" might be a better approach. I promise you my friends and I will never return and will certainly recommend one of your competitors (Tako or Condado) rather than ever steer anyone to this establishment. So, staff of the Bakersfield, work on your attitude or find a job where interacting and communicating with other people is not critical to the job. I also realize this is a chain and no one will likely care about this review, but with two other nearby competitors of the exact same nature, I urge you not to go here.   4/10: A follow-up to my review from Friday, 4/7. The manager, Charles, is outstanding and takes the customer experience seriously. I honestly expected no one to care much about my Yelp review but he reached out to me immediately to apologize. I will definitely give the Bakersfield another try as the food, drinks, and vibe were great and it is obvious from the manager's concern and follow-up with me that my experience is not the norm.",

The sangria was great (not for those who love a super sweet sangria -- my boyfriend was not here for it) I loved it! They make it with Malbec and it's so good! Also the fresh lemonade is just enough tart and sweet ! Would fully recommend to anyone looking for some good Mexican food in the city!",

    "text": "On Friday night, around 6:45, John and I decided to try out Bakersfield before the Guster show at the arts festival.  I completely agree with Rachel that there is a lot of awesome tacos out there in Pittsburgh, so with that in mind, we sunk our teeth into some more.   The wait was about 20 minutes, but with the show about to start and us running late, we opted to sit at the bar.  I had the house margarita and John had a beer that he said was a bit off from the bottle taste.  My margarita was good.  Lots of salt.  Nice mix of sweet and tart.  Then we headed into the guac and chips.  I was a huge fan of the guac!  It was really limey which I love and the chips were warm.    For the tacos, I got the short rib and the spicy pork, John opted for the pork belly and the chicken.  They were very beautiful, but they were also very small.  While it's not a fair comparison, to me, these were subpar when compared to Las Palmas, the greatest taco place in the city.  If you don't do the comparison, these are some pretty good tacos.  But they were tiny and I was hungry.  Three bites and they were gone!  The spicy was definitely nice and spicy, the pork belly was sweet with a wonderful kick from the pineapple, the chicken was decent and the short rib was very flavorful.  But for $4 a piece, I left just wanting a bit more.    I definitely want to go back to try the tortas and the salads which look awesome.    All in all, very good, but just can't beat Las Palmas.",

Ask for their full draft menu otherwise they will only share PBR.  I would definitely recommend the chips and guacamole. The chips are salted perfectly and the guac seems fresh and seasoned just right, a small amount of spice that blends well w the chips. You can tell the waiter whether you want red or green salsa otherwise the will bring you green as the default.   I got 3 tacos (short rib, steak and chicken). The chicken was the most flavorful but i didn't enjoy any of them. The corn tortilla shells left my mouth extremely dry.

I personally don't enjoy eating dinner while dripping with sweat which is what we all did. I've never eaten that fast before just to get out of there to get fresh cool air. At one point someone came over to FINALLY open the front windows but the damage was already done with the heat.   We have eaten at this establishment in Nashville and loved it, however the Pittsburgh location did not impress. I don't remember much of the food due to trying to stay cool and wipe the sweat from my face.   On top of all of this, there is no contact info on their website to send an email to management.",

    "text": "The chips and gauc deserves 5 stars, it was that good!  Guac was limey and flavorful just how I like it.  The service was something to be desired...took a while to get our order and drinks/refills.    I asked for suggestions on the tacos and the waitress suggested the bistec taco.  I asked if the steak was cooked through (I'm picky about how my meat is cooked) and she said yes.  I didn't want any pink in the steak and when the taco arrived and I took my first bite, all of it was chewy.  I took out the meat and cut them in half to find every single piece bright red.  If you're not a fan of medium rare steak, than I'd pass on this item.  I also went with the portobello taco and it was decent, flavorful.  In addition to the chips and gauc, we got the chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa came with a green and red salsa.  The green salsa was delicious and the red salsa had a spicy kick to it!  It was also good but had a sweetness that I didn't care for as much.    I'd like to go back and try some of their other tacos.",

The servers, while nice, were busy (at the bar) and inattentive. We actually wanted a second drink but after waiting 15 minutes with empty glasses we decided to just close out. The plain margarita was made from fresh juices and was delish at first, but ended up tasting too heavy and sweet.   The food: average at best. The queso, while nice and thick, tasted floury and was impossible to pick up using a chip. We got three different tacos and were equally unimpressed with them - while nothing tasted bad, I don't care if I ever have them again. Fish was missing something, the pork belly pastor was overcooked and tough and the short rib was unexpectedly spicy. Cilantro was a heavy addition.   We're not dying to return.",

    "text": "OK so, I grew up with Mexican family members. I'm accustomed to really delicious and authentic Mexican food,which I've felt is hard to find in Pittsburgh. I miss the flavors of California, New Mexico and Arizona. I heard about Bakersfield from a friend and decided to try it.  I ordered the hongos tacos and my fiance ordered the papas tostadas. I wouldn't typically eat kale slaw, but I went with everything the taco came with. We also had chips and salsa, which I'm used to being free but costs $3 here.   The chips and salsa were fantastic. Green salsa is the best and this didn't disappoint. The chips weren't overly salty,which can be a problem with places I've tried.  The hongos were cooked perfectly and had a noticeable mushroom taste without being too earthy. The kale slaw complemented the flavors very well. These tacos are balanced and a great (proper small) size.  The atmosphere is nice. When I went, the big window was open. I do really hate high bar stools for seating, but there are also picnic tables. Alcohol isn't my thing, but the bar area looked fun!  Staff was attentive and friendly. I'll be back!",

    "text": "Rounding up 3.5 stars. Stopped by for a late dinner around 10pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was full but luckily we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.   The location of this restaurant is great and the space itself is really cool, with the big open windows in the front.   I wasn't drinking so I can't comment on the margaritas, though they looked really good. They only had two beers on draft which seemed like a pretty limited selection. They had a lot of bottle options but as a person who definitely would choose a draft, I was sort of bummed.   We started with the chips and guac. A large portion and the guac had just the right amount of spiciness and a great flavor. It was very fresh, I just wish it was mashed up a little better. There were huge chunks of avocado that we ended up cutting up ourselves or mushing with a chip before eating.   We got a selection of tacos and the chicken chorizo torta (I think...the crispy one). Tacos were on the small side but very tasty..my favorites were the pastor and the short rib.   At $40 for two people without alcohol, the price is a bit steep, but the food is a bit more specialty and the location is prime so I was expecting about this price range.   Service was fine but unremarkable. One other thing to note..it is LOUD. The acoustics in the long narrow space mean everything is really amplified. three guys next to us were VERY obnoxiously singing the same one line from one song for about 45 minutes. They were clearly really drunk. It was annoying but this was 10pm on a Saturday at a bar/restaurant so I didn't feel justified being too mad about it. I would return.",

    "text": "Public service announcement! Awesome new restaurant on Penn that will NOT break the bank!   Knowing that this restaurant is a chain, I didn't have the highest hopes but was confident in my experience based on my fellow Yelper's reviews. I met two friends for a HH on a Monday around 4:45pm. We got there just in time because the placed filled by 6pm. Their special margarita flavor of the night was watermelon but they have a small assortment on their menu. Two of us ordered the spicy marg and one ordered the watermelon. Well, slap me silly and put a sombrero on my head- the spicy margaritas were top notch and hit the spot! And I've been to Tako and tried their spicy concoctions! Fresh, crushed jalapenos and just the right balance of marg mix with tequila sealed the deal for me with this drink. I'll order it again! Our friend sucked down her watermelon marg in record time and raved about it.  We started with fresh gauc, a side of pickled jalapenos and queso. The queso can be modified (add chorizo, etc) but we opted for regular. It comes out with a browned layer of cheese on top and the consistency is similar to hummus but the flavor is great! The gauc is fresh and even better paired with the pickled jalapenos! Two of our three got the pollo rojo (chicken) and I got the hongos (mushroom) Fresh and exploding with flavor! I look forward to trying more of their menu the next time I am in Pittsburgh.   Our waitress offered great suggestions, she was very knowledgeable and friendly. Great addition to Penn Ave and the Mexican food scene in downtown Pitt!",

We tried the same when in town last year with disastrous results so I was worried things might go awry but boy was I wrong.  What an absolutely wonderful experience.  They had us set up in the downstairs room, which is AWESOME, and we had the whole place to ourselves.  To make it simpler we had the selecciones dinner and everything was great and extremely well organized considering the teams arrived 40 minutes apart.  Awesome guac and tacos with plenty to go around, and did I mention the drinks...yummy and I didn't have to wait more than 2 minutes to get one.  The staff was amazing and very organized, not their first time doing this obviously.  I had many members of our party approach me and say that they LOVED every minute off it...the food, the drinks, the staff and the room.  Great job and you will be our first option next year when we are back in town for the tournament.  Matt",

We got the selecciones de la casa ($15 per person for 6+ parties) which comes with queso/guac/chips, salad, and tacos. We got to try all the tacos and really liked the short rib and fish. Got a free birthday whiskey shot which was nice, thanks to the server! Overall good fare for spending a fun Friday night.",

    "text": "Used the NoWait app on a friday to get in line for Bakersfield. To provide some perspective, the app showed about a 80 minute wait when i had checked in at 630pm. Not a big deal, but worth noting.  We started the evening with some drinks in the basement of Bakersfield. One thing that stood out was how incredibly hott it was in that basement. 10/15 degrees warmer then the upstairs, with little to no air circulating throughout. We ordered the Jalepeno margarita which was extremely tasty, also sampled were the bakersfield house margarita as well as their seasonal margarita. All which were well above average.  When our table was ready (about 90 minutes from when we checked in) we were all very happy to get out of the heat and upstairs where the air was flowing more freely. Unfortunately upon checking with the hostess we were informed that our table was ready, but it was downstairs, and that a table upstairs would be an additional 30 minute way. No way. We were hungry.  Presented with our table downstairs, we quickly noticed there weren't any chairs. The hostess scrambled around and was able to score 4 chairs after about another 5-7 minute wait. Because our table was in the mx of the downstairs bar scene, our service was shotty at best, and the location of our table brought with it people bumping into us as we ate, and even an instance where another patron thought it was communal seating and sat down right with us.  The food was good, with the salads being the high point of the meal. The tacos are small, but pack flavor and heat. Good for some, not good for all. The chili is hott to the point where its really not that good, and lacks taste and flavor other than heat.  The drinks were on point, the food was average, but the humid basement and chaotic dinner atmosphere turned me off. If you'd ask me if i would go back, i'd tell you yes. If you told me id have an hour and a half wait, id laugh and go somewhere else.",

Guacamole is a must.  I got the papas tostada and loved it.  My husband tried one of the many taco offerings and really enjoyed it as well.  While our waitress was extremely pleasant and helpful, she was often hard to find and charged our credit card the wrong amount, thus putting us in a position where we had to use another card due to the error as our real charge would then not go through.  Not exactly something I was thrilled with.   All in all, it wasn't bad and we'd definitely go back.  I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet night, families, or a romantic evening.

Added Chips and Guac for $7, LOADS of guac with avocado chunks throughout.  Most places skip on the guacamole, but for $7 you get an impressive amount.    I think I'll keep this place in mind for when I'm looking for a quick bite or want to munch on some chips and grab a beer with friends.  Much the same as my last review, the staff are super nice.

They had a good selection to choose from, not quite as exotic as the Tako selection, but no less tasty. I had the Mole, which was a shredded braised chicken taco. Normally I do not like onions, but the pickled onions on this taco really set it apart. I'm glad I didn't order without. That said, I would have liked a little Mole sauce perhaps, it could have used a little sauce for moisture, but otherwise top notch. I also had the Pork Belly Pastor. This taco was an absolute star. Absolutely delicious. In fairness, I did avoid the raw white onions on this one.   The place is also known for their tequila, and I would definitely say do not miss the chance to have a margarita here. The lime is fresh squeezed which really makes a huge difference. I could have had about a dozen of these.   The service here was really great as well. It was very casual and informal, but friendly and prompt. Ashley was our waitress and she was so friendly and energetic it was impossible not enjoy the experience here.   Looking forward to coming back again.",

Bakersfield is very large -- two whole floors with two bars. I know this will be my default walk-in restaurant in the future. Right on Penn Ave mixed in with a lot of other new restaurants, this one has huge open windows that will be great in the summer. The tacos were great. They're $4 each and it's fun to mix and match. The guac was great as well. They have fun beer boots and amazing $3 shot specials daily. I'm very impressed with this place and will be back often.

They offer a myriad of authentic Mexican tacos (think soft corn shell, strip steak, lime etc) but what's confusing is that you pay $4 thinking you're going to get more than one taco, but it's quite literally just ONE taco...and my friends and I all ordered different tacos but they all came out on the same plate... it was weird and we were kind of put off by it but beggars can't be choosers and we were looking for somewhere to continue our Tuesday night outing late night and t was the only place still open at 11pm. I would definitely go back now that I know how to order off the menu.",

We had to ask for everything....napkins, silverware, water, straws, salt and pepper, plates. It got to the point where I thought I was going to have to get up and make the meal myself. The lunch menu is very limited and the food was ok but nothing to rave about. I would take Condado over this place any day.",

    "text": "We arrived excited to try this place and the waitress was enthusiastic to begin with; the end result was disappointing. We ordered drinks and a bunch of food and then our waitress, who disappeared for the remainder of the meal which was problematic because she messed up our order, didn't bring us silverware, didn't provide us with the waters we asked for and I was left eating spicy tacos with no beverage. It was a busy night and she couldn't keep up - I get it, but bring in more servers when you know you are going to be busy.   The Drinks: We got a red sangria & a La Paloma - both were good, so at least we started out on a good note. We were feeling optimistic since there were no issues with the service so far and the drinks came out fast and were tasty.  The Starter Dishes: The guac & chips came out super fast but were seriously over salted and the guac had been made, I'm assuming, a couple hours in advanced and an entire lime was put into it to avoid it going brown. Or, at least, that's what it tasted like. We also ordered the papas - now if anyone here has been to Spain, papas are probably the most basic dish to make. All it consists of is fried potatoes and a mix of mayo & ketchup. What we received was an overly complicated dish that didn't resemble papas at all but a failed effort to provide a veg. dish that was extremely challenging to consume. Who puts fried potatoes on top of TWO large tortilla chips with beans in the middle and lettuce on the top and bottom of the dish? How are you supposed to consume that (especially because our waitress was missing for a good 30 minutes and we had no silverware)? Once we were able to track her down, even with a fork and knife it was a challenge to consume. So I can't really recommend either of these dishes to unsuspecting diners. I'm sure if we just stuck with chips & salsa we would have been happy.  The Main Dishes: We both ordered the same plate of tacos and only got one plate of tacos. So we started by sharing the first plate until they brought out the second plate (note we had to ask the person who brought our food, not our actual server because she was no where to be found at this point). I've had bigger issues at other restaurants and the tacos overall were decent, at least the pork ones. The beef one actually had a bone in it which was a rather unpleasant surprise. Not to mention, the meat was super dry so I would recommend to stay away from the beef. But, the pork tacos were the most redeeming part of the meal and our experience, they were perfect. Between the pork tacos & the drinks, they are the only reasons I'm giving a 3 star review...  But, overall, I would only recommend going to the bar at this place and maybe getting a pork taco or two. Nothing else was worthwhile for us and the service was a nightmare. You can find better tacos & drinks around the corner...",

Went to the downstairs bar where we received good service and quality drinks. After an hour wait, we went upstairs for dinner and were seated at a table with benches. I had the shredded beef tostada and it was very good. Everyone enjoyed the dinner and the atmosphere, which I would call upscale casual. The service at dinner was friendly and attentive. I'd recommend this for a group because the dinner choices seem to have a bit of something for everyone. Strongly recommend pitchers of margaritas as well as the fresh guacamole.

We were texted that our table was ready, told which table was ours, and sat there and watched it not be cleared for another 15 min after waiting 3 hours to be seated.  I complained to the manager, just asking when our table would be cleared, who then decided to give me an attitude, so needless to say this was our first and last trip to Bakersfield.",

I've had the tacos here a few times.  I think they are really tasty with higher quality ingredients - a solid choice but a lot of taco competition in the area.  The queso is not the best, but I've enjoyed the guac and the green salsa they have.  The service was not great.  We were there recently for lunch and they completely forgot our drinks.  A server also presented all the tacos ordered on a tray but the server didn't know which taco was which saying \"I think that's the pork...yeah...I think so\"  Not a big deal, but kind of a weird experience.",

The short rib was nice and juicy with a generous helping of meat. The fish was the True standout flavorwise and its rare to find good fish tacos in Pittsburgh. The pork belly was the only underwhelming one I wouldn't repeat. It was chewy, which is the exact opposite of the buttery texture I expect in pork belly. And it lacked much flavor other than pineapple. I look forward to going back when I can properly indulge in their margaritas and extensive tequila list",

We've been here several times over the past year or so.. each time, it's perfect-o.  The tacos are small, so you can order a few- each one has such distinct, amazing flavors... you can't go wrong.  The gauc is amazing- it's chunky, so you know it's FRESH and the flavor is GREAT.  Another staple is tha queso... it is unlike any queso I've ever had before.. The texture, the flavor, oh- and add the chorizo... you will NOT regret it!!! I almost forgot.. the jalepeno margritas.... YES! So refreshing.. love the citrus-y goodness with a hint of spice!

We did have a larger party, probably about 12 people and they were just not equipped to handle this large of a group. It took the servers quite a bit of time to get our drink orders and come back with checks. The tacos here were just mediocre for me - with the exception of the brisket. They tacos are super, super tiny so if you are hungry you can easily eat 4. One thing they do have going for them is the atmosphere and their margaritas - at the very least, stop in and have a margarita. I would go back and try to give it another chance, but right now its just not my favorite Pittsburgh taco joint.",

Since I've never had anything bad I'll just say my favorites : Chips and queso - you CANNOT leave Bakersfield without trying this, love the johnny salad, the mahi taco, and all the margaritas - if you'll have more than 1 and are with friends the best bang for your buck is to order a pitcher! The service is always excellant and the decor is super trendy. now i'm craving a margarita . . . .",

The chips and guac were pretty average. We were also given two salsas to try. For the tacos, I had the fish taco and a current special, the shrimp taco. All the tacos are served open faced. The fish taco was delicious. The fish was perfect and tasted great with the crisp slaw. The shrimp taco was also very good. Their tacos are on the smaller side, so you can definitely eat 2-3. My friend loved the huitlacoche. Overall, a nice place to grab some tacos and drinks in downtown.",

My best description is that they had a texture of Ethiopian bread, for those of you who have had that. Fix the taco, and this place is awesome.",

We got a fish, chicken and some sort of red meat taco (I don't eat red meat) and everyone loved what they had. They have homemade hot sauce which we loved too. The margaritas are delicious and fresh. They definitely tasted like they had real fruit juice - not that bad artificial flavor you get sometimes. My husband ordered the spicy margarita - he loves spicy and wants a really intense kick which this had, he was happy! The traditional margaritas were amazing.  We visited in 2-9-19 and the bar tender we had was AMAZING. I can't remember his name but we were there early afternoon - we asked him for taco and margarita recommendations and he was great. My friend and I shared a margarita because we were doing a crawl that day (this was our first stop) and he was so nice about it. He gave us 2 glasses to split the margarita which was above and beyond customer service. He talked to us and checked in often to make sure we had everything we needed including water!!",

We also order a Milanesa Torta, the chicken was thin and flavorful making perfect and really tasty. The cochinita Pibil is one of the best one I ever had, the onions were so good and the bread was toast to perfection. I'm having lunch here tomorrow again and will be leaving hoping to find a flavorful place like this in our busy LA",

The flavors of both tacos were terrific and the guacamole and salsas were awesome.  I was so excited for terrific tacos but the soggy taco shells were impossible to ignore.  Many places serve 2 taco shells when multiple ingredients are likely to seep through. Bakersfield, I'd suggest you might want to consider this. After all, who wants to eat their taco with a fork?",

    "text": "After a very disappointing first trip to Bakersfield, a manager was kind enough to contact us and apologize.  He didn't try to make excuses or justify anything, just let us know that the communication broke down somewhere between staff members, and he'd like for us to come back and give them another chance.  This in and of itself speaks volumes for the restaurant, as not many are willing to reach out and really care that their customers have a fantastic experience when they dine with them.  We stopped back in this evening, and it was night and day.  The waitress was fantastic, the drinks were very well-crafted, and the food was excellent.  For the price point, which is a very reasonable $4 a taco, the quality of the food is very good.  We tried the corn dip (I can't remember the name, but essentially like a dip version of Mexican street corn), and we each tried a couple of different tacos.  Unlike a lot of taco places, where you can only taste sour cream, generic salsa, and some guacamole, these were very thought out...the crispy shrimp with pickled fresnos was a personal favorite.  All in all, I'm going to say that my first negative experience was a fluke on a busy night (there was a Pirates game, a Pens game, the Arts festival, and a show at the Benedum, so I'm not surprised that it was hectic), and that Bakersfield is an excellent dining option and we will certainly be back.  Very glad we gave them a second chance.",

A special shout out to Beans, who is the coolest, sweetest server ever with absolutely rocking hair. My friends and I would go back just to hang out with her!  The guac and chips are awesome. You also get green & red sauces with them and both are fantastic. To drink I love their Paloma, but they also have a pretty impressive collection of drinks from Mexico & Latin America that you don't see at other places. Great scene, great Beans :-)",

The servers were awesome. They were attentive and handled large groups as a team! (Shout out to CJ!). The mixed drinks were also made well served quickly. Overall, highly recommend this place for drinks out, dinner, and they are especially good at handling larger groups.",

    "text": "We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve with a great meal, and Bakersfield did not disappoint! The whiskey and tequila selection was impressive, but we started with a pitcher of the Bakersfield Margaritas ($32). Absolutely delicious with limes squeezed fresh for each order. The Chips and Queso appetizer ($6) with chorizo (+ $1) was a nice surprise. It was placed in a cast iron skillet and baked in the oven before serving. I ordered the Short Rib Tostada ($9) as my main course. The short rib was seasoned well and very tender, and anything with a fried egg on top is a winner in my book. My buddy ordered the Short Rib Torta ($10) and almost licked his plate clean. We felt like this was a killer value with a combined total tab, including tax, of only $62. Best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time. There wasn't a drop of margarita or a bite of food left at the end of our meal. The service was attentive, energetic, and incredibly friendly. We could not have asked for a better experience. Zero complaints.",

When seated we waited 15-20 minutes and no one had even taken our drink order. Paige the bartender made eye contact came right over listened to us took our order and immediately got her manager Alex involved. Alex came over apologize and let us know how he was going to correct the issue for us. Appetizers were so good that we ordered that  we were to busy to noticed that we were still waiting another 15- 20 minutes before realizing that our dinner order had not been taken. I went over to Paige she came right over with pen and paper apologized again and took our order. She owned the experience never made an excuse apologized and even made her recommendations on the menu. We ordered what she recommended and was very satisfied!! Alex the manager came back over apologized again and it was truly ok at this point. We didn't have time to focus on what didn't go right because Paige made it right and perfect! It was a mistake not hers....and we appreciate the fact again the Paige only being there for three days took charge didn't blame anyone owned our experience and corrected it!! I will definitely be back and I recommend going for the great food and service!! Thank you again Paige and Alex for taking good care of us, not being rude and correcting the issue. Alex you have an great employee and as a facilitator for a major company I would like you to know that she's a keeper!! Paige I can't say thank you enough for your stepping in and not just passing it along because you're new. Great leadership to you both!! BAKERSFIELD TACOS because of Paige I will be back!!",

    "text": "I stopped in Bakersfield based on yelp! Reviews when I needed a quick lunch. I was able to walk to the restaurant from the convention center and was quickly seated at the bar. The environment of the restaurant is trendy/hipster with lots of wood, exposed brick and iron embellishments. I was somewhat surprised that this was a taco/modern Mexican joint since nothing about the name, atmosphere or staff seemed to reflect the food.  We ordered the chips and queso and I got the Willie salad. The chips were crisp and salty, just like I like them. The queso was not spicy and lacked flavor, but if you are looking to fill your cheese fix, this will do it. My salad was really incredible and huge--I wasnt able to finish it after filling up on the chips so I was sad to leave it behind. There was a good emphasis on fresh ingredients, which I always appreciate.  The only reason I was not able to give Bakersfield a full 5 stars was the service. We sat at the bar, right in front of the draft beer, in hopes of quick and efficient service since we were on a time crunch. This was a Saturday afternoon and the bar was moderately busy. The bar tender must was been new because he wasn't familiar with the menu or ingredients. But he was also pretty slow and lacked attention. My water glass sat empty and in clear view most of my meal and until I waved someone down and asked for a refill. I'm sure this could be a fluke, but it certainly impacted my experience.",

Decor is really great, barn wood and Edison bulbs... whats not to like.. expect the seating, it's a small place and sitting less than 6 inches from the table next to you is not comfortable however if you have a larger party there are picnic style tables...   Staff is warm, friendly and inviting and will help with any questions.   The alcohol is great and the mixed drinks are tasty, and arrive in a mason jar, I preferred the red wine sangria which came with plump raspberries.  The food... a limited menu to say the least.. and for me it was very hard to understand, since I am not to well versed in the lingo, we ordered a variety of tacos and I would say the best where the fish and  pineapple Style. The mushroom though seemingly good was very spicy. I would also highly recommend the chips and queso. Though the food wasn't bad you can get better tacos from the pittsburgh taco truck... just saying. ..  BUT  All and all it was good  and we had a great time...",

    "text": "Today I decided to give Bakersfield another try with my coworker in tow. We arrived promptly at noon and were greeted by a pleasant woman behind the hostess station. The restaurant itself wasn't quite crowded yet, which I attribute to the fact it was below zero outside because it definitely picked up during our meal. After we sat down, we were greeted by a perky waiter named Chris. He was upbeat and attentive to our needs. He also didn't disappear for long periods of time like the waitress I had during my prior visit.   Since we had a little bit of time, we opted to give the queso a second chance and I'm sure glad we did. It came out hot and had a gooey coating that melted and moved just as cheese should. It was quite glorious. Chris recommended a few items from the menu and my coworker actually selected Chris's favorite, the Milanesa, a chicken cutlet on a telera roll. The portion size was generous and the lime accented the dish in a creative way. I decided to try three different tacos. I ordered the bistec taco, the cochinita pibil, and the pork belly. The meat was cooked on the well side for the steak, which was fine because it wasn't overdone. The only thing I didn't enjoy about this one was some of the cabbage slaw was a bit too tough. The cochinita was spicy, but not so much so that I needed to gulp massive amounts of water. It also had pickled onions which were delicious and added a bit of sourness to the taco. Finally, the pork belly was something completely foreign, but made sense. I've never had pork belly before, so I don't really know how it should have been cooked, but I really liked the flavor profile when combined with the juicy pineapple. It was so savory!   Overall, I'm glad I decided to come back to Bakersfield. I was impressed by our diligent and personable waiter and really enjoyed the creative twist and flavor profile of the tacos I ordered. Additionally, my coworker's fiance loves tacos and he found a new place to bing her!",

We walked in and sat down and just our luck, sitting beside us was a depressed woman that was blatantly wasted. Long story short, this woman started causing some major drama because she was wasted and proceeded to escalate and verbally attack us for reasons we couldn't understand. We were very uncomfortable and hinted to the bartender that this woman needed to leave but they didn't handle her until she started getting loud and yelling at people on the other side of her and suddenly my sister and I started standing up because we felt she was about to start a physical threat. I wish they would have been more on top of it and acted faster the first time we warned them, as far as noticing how wasted/depressed she was which was not a good recipe. But I will say that after they removed her, they did treat us VERY well and made sure to do everything possible to make sure we were taken care of as their customers. The food was Really good, guacamole was very fresh and tasty and our margarita pitcher was good and exactly what we needed. Great bar. Great atmosphere. We will definitely return next time we visit.",

We sat in the downstairs area, near the awesome mural on the wall of the last supper but with skeletons. Our server was wonderful and attentive to our large party for the evening. To start, we had the queso and OMG was the queso amazing. SO much flavor - we loved it. They had PBR in boots on special and $5 shots of tequila (I forget the brand, but I know it was not bottom shelf). The tacos are small- like two bites each, but they have a ton of flavor. I ordered the pollo rojo (braised chicken, smoky guajillo chili salsa, queso fresco, white onion, chipotle lime crema, cilantro) and the mole (oaxacan style braised chicken, pickled red onion, queso fresco, cilantro) tacos- both were wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly one and loved it. I also ordered the milanesa which is classified as a torta and was UNbelievable.It was a chicken cutlet, black beans, salsa verde, arugula, avocado lemon mayo on a telera roll. DELICIOUS. This place is awesome, great service, very affordable and super tasty. Check it out, now.",

I've had mixed experiences.. I've had great service with super friendly waiters and bartenders and I've always had just mediocre service where we weren't given things we asked for multiple times. Still a GREAT place to try and some of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh!",

Being someone who thoroughly enjoys traditional tacos found at places like La Palapa, I also really love the trendy take on the tacos here. I have visited Bakersfield a number of times and have sampled quite a few, but my favorite are the fish and the huitlacoche (corn truffles). As we all know, the guac is to die for. The queso is also really savory and delicious, and surprisingly, the Willie salad is on point as well. I have come here with groups ranging in size from one other person up to a large work function, and I really recommend it!  What really makes this a five star review is how wonderful the staff was when working with me to plan a large work event. We had a party of 16 and they made sure we had enough space, we were semi-privately located downstairs, and we had a variety of delicious food. I really recommend Bakersfield for something like this!",

I was disappointed in the lack of veg options and the two veg tacos offered both had mushrooms, which I despise :) I did end up trying one only to remind myself that, yah, mushrooms aren't for me! I did enjoy the papas tostados and it was quite a generous serving for the price. I also wasn't a huge fan of my Spicy Margarita - while it tasted delicious, the lack of alcohol was apparent and I passed on a second $10 drink.   If anyone asks me where to go with a large party, I will def recommend Bakersfield. Bonus, it's loud as all get out in there so if you're a loud person (some people make that claim about me), no one will even notice! And our server did a great job despite some small mishaps and really was hustling serving several large groups.",

The best homemade hot sauce I've had anywhere. Our server Ashley was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and made some great recommendations on the tequilas and food. They have a great team approach to serving so you don't have to wait for anything. I hope they expand to the Boston area.",

Each time that I have been in a manager has made a point to stop by and check up on me and make sure everything is to my liking. They have an outstanding bourbon and tequila list that would rival just about anyone.  The food is top notch as well, I've tried several different tacos as well both types of the tortas (they are like a paninis) and am always beyond satisfied. The thing I like most about this place is that it's not like a lot of places downtown that is geared towards a certain type of crowd, this place to me is for everyone, which is something that is refreshing and that most definitely needed dowtown.  5 stars all the way in my book, keep up the outstanding work on all fronts, I will most certainly be back again and again.",

My coworkers and I were thinking of some Mexican food, so up comes yelp and Bakersfield come up as close by and great reviews. We were able to snag a table before it got too busy and I can see why people flock here the food was amazing. They make guacamole every hour and it was some of the best guac I've had and I'm from Southern California. They make the tortillas in house and makes a difference. I had the fish taco which was a delight mix of tangy and spicy. I also tried the papas tostado and it was spicy and delish for those wanting a vegetarian option. I already know on our next trip to Pittsburgh we are coming back.",

I wasn't so keen on the short ribs taco (which sounded better than it is) but it was an A for concept, at least, and the fish taco was great, with nice combinations of unusual ingredients. Nice bites. They have local brews on tap and service was prompt and friendly, and the Tequila of the Day is $3. Not bad. A touch pricey, and I wouldn't go there hunting for high end haute or authentic Mexican food, but as far as fake Americanized Mexican bar food, well above average.",

It is basically a Mexican restaurant with very good tacos and margaritas. I had a short rib taco, my wife had a fish taco, and both were excellent. The guacamole is made fresh every 15 minutes, and it is delicious. We were surprised to find such good Mexican food in downtown Pittsburgh.",

Their guacamole is nice and chunky and the queso dip comes in a hot iron mini pan.  Not quite sizzling but browned cheese on top.... yums!  Unfortunately don't serve root beer but they do have Mexican Coke with real sugar  not artificial sweetener.    The tacos were great too.  Loved the braised pork and the mahi-mahi fish taco (they have mahi in Pittsburgh :).  The steak taco was flavorful and good but I like my meat thinly sliced.  Overall you can't lose here!  Great food!  Great value and nicely and smartly decorated.    Did I say I loved the guac?",

The $2 tacos are good, but I don't know that I'd buy them full-price. They're a bit on the small side for what you'd originally pay and, while they're good, they're not anything majorly more impressive compared to the other tacos in the area. That said, their guacamole was wonderful and enough to get me to return again. In addition, they have a solid draft list and a diverse cocktail menu.  Definitely a good option if you're already in the area and want something quick and casual.",

    "text": "I am so happy with all of the fantastic new taco places opening up around Pittsburgh lately. And Bakersfield is near the top of the list!  Bakersfield has a nice vibe that I find comparable to many of the other urban/industrial restaurants that have been opening in recent months. There's a nice mural on one of the walls, and of course, plenty of exposed brick and lightbulbs. Bakersfield is larger than I thought it would be which was a nice surprise. There are two different bars: one on the main level and one on the lower level. As a whole, the space is very clean and has a warm atmosphere.  My friends and I came on a Monday around 5:30 PM and were told we'd have about a 30 minute wait for our table. We headed over to one of the bars for some guac, queso, and drinks before being seated. I ordered a margarita, which is a bit out of character for me, but I absolutely loved it. It was the perfect mix of salty and sweet and was definitely worth the $8 price since it came in a large mason jar. I had read rave reviews about both the guac and queso on Yelp so we were looking forward to trying both...and we were highly impressed! I honestly could not choose a favorite. The queso came out piping hot and charred on the top, and had just the perfect amount of zest to it. The guacamole was some of the best I've had in a long time. I'm sure this seems nitpicky, but I'm always upset when I order dip at a restaurant and they're stingy with the chips - there's nothing worse than having extra dip leftover and no chips to eat it with. We definitely didn't have this problem at Bakersfield.  A note on the service - from the hostess to the bartender to our waitress (shout out to Beans!), I was overly impressed. Everyone was extremely upbeat and clearly cared to make our meal a positive one. Unfortunately we ended up having to wait about an hour and 15 minutes for our table (some people refused to leave even though they had already paid), but the hostess was very apologetic and ultimately it wasn't the restaurant's fault. When we finally were seated, we ordered a myriad of tacos. I decided on the pollo rojo taco, which was phenomenal. I loved all the fresh cilantro on top, and the chicken was flavored perfectly. I think I could have eaten ten of these!  At the end of the night one of the managers, Justin, came over to our table to ask about our experience, which was a nice touch. Overall, my first experience at Bakersfield was wonderful and I absolutely can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Taco night, taco night, Bakersfield -- have me some tacos, as soon as I can!  Bakersfield is the place to go if you want \"bougie\" tacos. They make the taco shells from scratch -- If that doesn't tell you what type of place Bakersfield is, then I'm not sure what to tell ya!  [FOOD] I had chips and guac, three tacos (al pastor, baja shrimp, and short rib) and a sangria. Personally, I found the guac to be very garlicky, though I'm not offended nor opposed to that. (I love foods that give me bad breath -- but not because they give me bad breath ...) If you're going with a friend or a larger group, definitely get chips and guac (or salsa) because they give you a lot. They're nice to snack on while you wait for the main entree. The al pastor was my personal favorite. The balance of sweet and savory was perfect. The baja shrimp was fresh and the short rib was hearty. All in all, I loved the level of care that was put into the taste and appearance of the tacos -- however, the size was much smaller than I anticipated. If you're the type that needs a lot to get full, this isn't the place for you. Bakersfield is more that place you go for the Downtown dining experience, especially because it is a bit pricier. But hey! You're also paying for the atmosphere. The sangria was AMAZING! I love fruity drinks and this was definitely my type of drink. Sweet, fresh and pretty!  [SERVICE] The moment I walked in, the host welcomed me with a smile. She made me feel comfortable and taken care of. Also, My waiter was beyond outstanding. He was so on top of everything, helpful and upbeat. He positively added to my experience. Needless to say, he received a very generous tip.  [ATMOSPHERE] Let's just talk about how NICE the interior is. The lighting really adds to the place and sets the mood for laughter and fun. The restrooms are CLEAN (trust me, this is important to note) and the bar looks cool.  Would I go here again? Yes! I wouldn't go often just because I am a broke college student ... however, I'd go for a quick bite and drinks with friends here and there. The biggest reason I'd go back is because of the service.",

There was a perfect balance of avocado, spices, salt, and lime, but most importantly, wasn't overwhelmed by cilantro. We tried several different tacos with the Hongos being my favorite and the Short Rib my fiance's favorite. The tacos were all pretty good, but the tortilla seemed a little bland and soggy. They weren't the texture I was expecting for homemade tortillas. The tacos were also a pretty good size. I ended up eating 3 and my fiance ate 6, though if we didn't have the chips and guac, I would have wanted another. We went a little too early in the afternoon for me to try their margaritas, but I've heard the pineapple margarita is amazing and would love to go back and try it one day. The decor of the restaurant is really cool, the servers were all super friendly and attentive, and the ambience was perfect for a Saturday day-date (though a little bit on the pricier side).",

You'll want reservations unless you're willing to sit at bar if it's just two people.   The only downside that cannot be controlled was the loud group of girls next to us talking about the MTV awards.....  Bartenders are hip.",

I came here around 4PM, in between lunch and dinner because I was in the area, starving, could get parking and was glad I would be able to eat at this place I had heard so much about without getting on a waitlist or waiting in line. I ordered a virgin house margarita which was so good as well as a spicy mahi taco and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco was so so but the spicy mahi was absolutely delicious! Love the way it was seasoned and the touch of sliced green apple in it. I ended up ordering 2 more mahi tacos to go to eat later that night if/when I got the munchies. The service here was super friendly and pretty fast as well. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was thrilled to return here with my best friend to introduce her to Bakersfield when I had previously visited. Normally they would seat you in a \"group\" setting but since this was her first time here I asked if we could dine alone so she would feel comfortable. They separated a high top table for us so we could chat.  Bakersfield is a chain restaurant named after Bakersfield,California where it was started. Everything on the menu is ala carte including the chips so the two of us decided to try a few of the tacos. I had told her they were made in house so she was thrilled with the opportunity to try fresh and not store bought taco shells. We ordered a total of six. We both had the steak with slaw, the pulled chicken and slaw. She opted for a second steak one for the fifth and i went with my favorite which was the pork with pineapple.  They were so good but so messy! They give you a large plate along with silverware to catch the drippings. The chicken a bit of a zing to it, my pork and pineapple was absolutely delicious. I found the steak one to be just slightly tough but we were basically pleased with all our choices.  We came over the lunch hour so it wasn't too busy. But it was still fairly loud!  We decided to forgo the bevvies since we had theater tickets.  I must admit our waiter was correct that 2-3 tacos a piece is sufficient for a meal. The tacos sell for $4.00 each. She told me this place offered one of the best tacos she had ever eaten so this place will be on our return list when we are downtown again.",

    "text": "Omg salt alert!!! This place has got to buy there salt in bulk bc they are heavy handed with the stuff.  We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime.   They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it.    The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend.   I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words.  The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious.  I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates.  The drinks were solid and i would recommend the margarita's. Solid place to have a drink and the decor was also modern and cool. The crowd gave it a good vibe and I could definitely see myself hanging out here if I am in the area again.  If they can only figure out the salt situation this would be a 4 star place.",

    "text": "**UPDATE** - Shortly after posting my review here, I got  a reply from a Yelp profile that says \"John L.\" that is signed by Brian R., one of the partners in Bakersfield. I got on the phone with him and he told me that he wanted to send me something for my troubles, so I emailed him my shipping information. Months later, I've never heard or received anything. That seems to be on trend with the behavior of Bakersfield.   The atmosphere in this place wasn't bad. My girlfriend and I ordered 3-4 tacos each which came out all on a platter for us to share, and they were all delicious. Unfortunately, that's where the good part of the review ends.   Shortly after our trip to Pittsburgh ended, I noticed my credit card statement showed two charges from Bakersfield. Working at a bank and understanding the process, I called the restaurant in an attempt to have the duplicate charge reversed. I spoke with a manager who promised to get back to me within 2 days. She never did, so I called back a week later. I spoke to the manager who, supposedly, the first manager should have passed this information along to in the first place. I thought at this point at least I was in the right hands. She told me the same thing, give her no more than 2 days, but again I never heard back.   At this point, I filed a dispute with the credit card company. A month after that (and now 2 months after dining at the restaurant), my credit card company says that Bakersfield never responded to them either! Seems like they are running some sort of shady business going here.   Every member of their staff and management that I spoke to denied the fact that I was charged twice. Oh and did I mention that one charge showed \"card swiped\" and one showed \"manually keyed\"? How would that show up so distinctly for my credit card company but Bakersfield has no record?? If anything, go for a few tacos and pay with cash, because at the least the food was good.",

Because of the event, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table of 6. Most of the tacos on the menu was $4, which is pretty decent for high quality tacos. However on certain nights after 10pm, they offer $2 tacos happy hour.   We each ordered 2 tacos and took a bite out of each other's so we can try them all. The tacos were...okay. I ordered carnitas (a classic) and the fish tacos. There were two sauces we could add to our tacos. I really like the green one (I think it's avocado based). The tacos tasted like any other tacos I've had, which made me a bit disappointed because this was a highly reviewed place. Tbh, I liked the $2.50 tacos from Las Palmas more than this. However I would come during happy hour for $2 tacos because it's a pretty good deal for decent tacos.",

If you're on your own, 3 tacos should be more than enough, while if you're here with a group, ordering and sharing generously from all the offerings is a great idea.  Better yet, there's a strong booze program here. Even though the menu might look a bit compact, there are some solid craft beers available, in addition to whatever you'd like to order from the full bar. Service is also friendly, helpful, and fast. Moreover, despite the bar atmosphere, the overall environment didn't seem to be as rowdy or douchetastic as nearby outlets. Yet another great find thanks to all you Yelpers!",

My margarita was perfect and my husbands drink was super strong and interesting  We ordered chips & queso + guacamole. She said the guac is made in house fresh every hour. It really was delicious. Their queso waa also good. Some of the chips were under-cooked which gave them a stale taste but other chips were cooked to perfection (although pretty salty) overall we enjoyed everything. We decided against food because nothing really stood out to us (it was late night & we kind of jusy wanted drinks and an app)  The atmosphere is pretty loud, but fun. Old school bluegrass music plays in the background (even on a hip Friday night.. Not that you can actually hear or get annoyed by it lol) and Western movies play over the bar.  Pretty cool place.

    "text": "Taco fan? Then Bakersfield should be on your list.  Bakersfield has good drinks and some delicious tacos. However, my favorite thing on the menu is their queso. Arriving in its own mini skillet, the queso has been baked in the oven so that the creamy cheese has a golden brown top. The caramelized top adds flavor and texture which makes it different from many of the queso options out there. Avoiding one of the major pitfalls of many dips (dip to chip ratio per order), the queso arrives with an enormous basket of chips so that no bit of queso will go uneaten. (Though a spoon would work just fine in a pinch.)  The tacos at Bakersfield are small, so order a few. Some of the most delicious options are the cocinita pibil, the short rib, and the Baja shrimp.   I also enjoy their margaritas, which you can make spicy with peppers for just $1 more!  As far as service goes, the food comes out quickly, but the drinks (especially mixed drinks like margaritas) might take a little longer during happy hour.",

When I asked for our own table you would have thought I was asking for them to give up their first born child. Tacos were not good, tortillas were dry and fell apart as soon as I picked up my tacos, had to use a fork to eat my tacos. Our waitress was not on the ball either and when we asked for anything we felt like we were bothering her. Anyone saying this place is 4 or 5 star need to get out more often, this place is not even close to 4-star. Maybe I dined here on an off day but what are the chances of receiving not only bad food but bad service as well on the same visit?",

We were sat at a large booth downstairs which I was super excited about because I love the vibe downstairs! Yes, it is dim, but I think that gives it such a cool, rustic feel. You can absolutely still read the menu (as some people have previously stated that they could not) so I would highly recommend sitting downstairs because there is also a very large bar down there!  This was my fiance and I's our third time here and hands down the best and I believe this was due to our server, Mandy! She was fantastic all around. The other couple we were with had never been here before and she answered all of their questions and accommodated our friends super picky palate. Her recommendation for the Milanesa sandwich was spot on--the flavors seemed odd when reading it off the menu but worked SO WELL together. Highly highly recommend! Anything we needed, Mandy was always there checking in and made sure our drinks were refreshed. Props to her, we will absolutely ask for her the next time we go back, which will be sooner rather than later!  We also had the rock shrimp and Bistec tacos--both were 10/10. The pickled cabbage on the rock shrimp tacos was such a nice touch. We've had the Queso in the past and that is always a solid choice too!  Thanks to Bakersfield and Mandy for another successful trip!",

We were seated promptly, although there was a large wait for walk-ins. Our waiter was friendly and helped us through the menu as it was our first time. We started with the unlimited chips and queso. The queso was a little bit grittier, like an authentic queso should be, and the chips were fresh. I had the Al Pastor and Short Rib tacos, sans cilantro. The tortillas were so fresh and delicious. I could have had a million more by themselves. The prices were a little steep for what I'm used to (in Texas), but it's hard to find a good taco in Pittsburgh. Both of these tacos were incredible. The only hiccup in this visit is that we had to flag down the server to get our check. Otherwise, a classic 5/5 visit to Bakersfield.",

The tacos came out and we tried the steak and fish tacos, both were so good! We were absolutely obsessed with the mix of flavors in the steak taco and the fish tacos were so delicious as well.

Probably a smart idea as 5 IT guys eating tacos in the heat is not a sight anyone should be subjected to. So we went around the corner to Bakersfield.  The place looks great, they have a nice drink menu (no brews as it's a work lunch), and the taco offerings seem promising. The service was top notch. We got our food and all of us agreed it was just \"ok\". I had a fish taco and an al pastor. Neither were worth writing home about (why I'm writing to yelp instead). Bakersfield seems more like a place I'd want to drink and eat chips and queso rather than try to have a meal. At least they had AC to cool our sweaty IT bods.",

It's so Texas! After living in Austin for 4 years, it tends to be hard to please me when it comes to tacos, so I'm basing it on that.   First, our server was really friendly and gave good service, but she got our order wrong. My date ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2, and they brought out 4 on a tin tray and 2 of them were incorrect. We asked the runner which tacos were which and then she ran back to the kitchen to grab the other. The server came over and apologized for the mistake, so no biggie on that!  I had one of the mole tacos and an al pastor. The mole was pretty good and the pastor with the pineapple was awesome. My only complaint is that the tortilla was a little dry.   I would return here and get some different items. All in all a good experience!  Note: In a previous reviewers post she said that the restaurant didn't use the NoWait app, however, they have changed that. We used it last night and were notified at the time we were to be seated via that app.",

I was surprised to see that it was a mexican restaurant, because bakersfield does not sound mexican at all... We rode a taxi service to this restaurant, and it was a bit difficult to spot because there was construction going on right in front of the restaurant.   My first impression of the restaurant when I walked in: \"Wow, this place is empty.\" We weren't greeted immediately, so that was weird since the restaurant didn't have a lot of people. There a few people dining in, and some people at the bar. Our waitress was nice, but the rest of the workers in the restaurant seemed like they didn't want to be there.   My friend ordered a salad with chicken (Willie), which she said was really good. We also ordered cheese and tortilla chips, which were interesting. The cheese was mixed with two cheeses, one of the cheeses had a grainy texture, which I was surprised by. It tasted alright, but I didn't really like the texture of the grainy cheese. Loved how the cheese was really hot though. Anyway, I ordered a fish and bistec taco. The bistec taco was alright, tasted fine. I loved that the fish in my taco was pretty big in size, and tasted pretty great until I saw it was really undercooked. I told my waitress, and she came back with a new fish taco that wasn't as big, but was fully cooked. Would I come back if I visited Pittsburgh again? Not likely, but we'll see..",

Adding guacamole, queso and/or salsa to the meal never disappointed either!  The tacos are reasonably priced so you can try a few without spending too much. They also have good drink specials, like a Shot of the Day and delicious margaritas.  It gets a bit loud in here if it's packed (which it has been every time I've visited), especially upstairs, so if you're looking for an intimate meal, I'd suggest going during non-peak hours or requesting to sit down stairs.",

From the pollo rojo, the braised beef, and the fish taco, to the tequila, we were very pleased! I strongly suggest the chips and queso app, and go with your stomach on the tacos, because from what we saw -- you can't go wrong!  Cheers, Bakersfield!",

Our party of four shared a variety of small tacos -- all of them tasty and distinct from more plebeian Mexican fare. They have a wide range of beers and whiskies as well. The main issue may be that this place is very popular and can get crowded and require a wait. I see from the website that this is a chain but it didn't have a \"chain\" feel but rather like a Pittsburgh eating institution. Recommended.",

    "text": "I was impressed with our first visit to Bakersfield on a lot of fronts, mostly the size and scale of the restaurant, and of the food. We went with a large party of 16 people, and while they have a lot of big tables available, it still wasn't big enough for our entire group as we crammed in.  The biggest surprise of the night was their group dinner special where $15 gets you guac, salsas, queso, chips, salad, and from what I could tell, unlimited tacos. The guacamole was wonderful, as were the presumably homemade chips. The salsa had a smokey chipotle flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of, but there was also a cilantro verde sauce that I enjoyed. Queso was unique with the best part being the peppers, black beans, and chorizo sitting on top.  Nice family-style salad, that I didn't eat a lot of as I was already getting full. When they brought out the trays of tacos, each had 1 pork with pineapple, chicken, beef, veggie, and fried fish. I tried all except the chicken and veggie - and the standout was certainly the pork with pineapple on top. Fried fish taco was also delicious but the slaw was veryyyyy salty.  Drinks aren't outrageously priced, and it's neat that they had such a large list of not only tequila, but whiskey.  The downsides from my first visit was first, the sound. Being Pittsburgh, trendy, and new, you of course have Edison bulbs, exposed brick, steel fixtures... and as is usually the case, it was very loud. I couldn't even hear the group on the other side of the table unfortunately.  And while the waitstaff that was bringing the food and drinks were great, our waiter in particular was pretty terrible, and he somehow had two huge parties he was waiting on. Being a taco and tequila restaurant I tried to order either Sangrita or a Mexican Mule, neither of which he had ever heard of. No big deal, and had I been able to ask the bartender they might've known what I was talking about. It was sort of interesting as they don't have many cocktails on the menu outside of the margarita and a spicy margarita that my wife enjoyed. Beer and liquor prices are reasonable though.  I'll definitely be back here for another visit, on first glance it doesn't beat out some other taco joints in Pittsburgh, but not by much.",

However, that did not stop us from enjoying our evening with the lively crowd. We ordered food at the bar and it was all delicious, we tried an array of tacos in our group. My favorite was definitely the short rib.  I went there for dinner the next week. We made a reservation however, we were put at a community table. It wasn't a problem but I wish they could have explained that in our reservation. Once again, the tacos were delicious. This time I went with the veggie one and loved it!  A little spicy but very flavorful. 2 tacos were definitely enough to fill me up. One things that was great was the margarita they were featuring. It was very strong so prepare yourself! The table service was great. Our waitress was patient with us as we were talking and didn't decide on food for a bit. Definitely a good place for happy hour downtown and for dinner.

    "text": "Picture it: A cold Sunday afternoon, lunch with a foodie Manhattanie friend I haven't seen in ages; we want a restaurant, we want it to be good, we want it to be close to his hotel because it's 15 degrees out, and we want it to be open, because it's Sunday and we're downtown. Yelp told me the whole block was good, so I was open to whatever worked out. But let's face it. I was born in San Diego and I'm always chasing tacos, so I wasn't disappointed when this was the first place whose doors were unlocked.  We were seated promptly and the host was knowledgeable but not overbearing about drink possibilities. In the end we went with fresh-squeezed lemonade because we weren't in an alcoholic mood, and that was a good call even in the middle of winter. Who does not want fresh-squeezed lemonade? Why don't I freshly squeeze my lemons? (I'm lazy, that's why, but I may have to be less lazy because it was really delicious.)  We started with guac, chips, and queso. Friends, the queso comes with that lovely crust on it, you know what I'm talking about, like the cheese that hits the pan when you're making grilled cheese and it's the best. There's a reason they serve it with a spoon. The guacamole is fresh and chunky. None of that smoothly processed nonsense.  We also got a variety of tacos, on homemade tortillas. There's another thing I wish I wasn't too lazy to make. Tortillas are not just a taco delivery device, friends. They are for tastiness. My designated tacos were the chicken mole and the hongos (mushrooms). Not too spicy, but that chicken, wow, so delicious. Presentation was delightful and the filling-to-tortilla ratio is such that you may lose a bite (or lend a bite to your dining companion before eating the taco, this is a better plan, just sayin) but overall you're getting a decent amount of innards without being left eating several bites of tasty tortilla.  The service was good, timely (except you should obviously expect your FRESH squeezed lemonade to take a bit of time because they are squeezing lemons and that takes a hot minute), attentive but not up your nose. Note that we were in there on a Sunday during a football game so it was only about 1/3-1/2 full, which is my preferred fullness of restaurant. Put this on my \"A+ would taco again\" list.",

    "text": "First and foremost, STOP RIGHT HERE if you are planning on hosting a big party at Bakersfield Pittsburgh.  The following is my most recent account in trying to arrange a 30th birthday party for approximately 50 people.    Let me begin by noting that I called over a month in advance in order to secure my desired date in mind.  With that being said the first time I called, the hostess referred me to their online email system to request a reservation of this size.  After not hearing back for over a week from a single soul, I obviously called back.  Upon doing so I was given the run around with - \"Hold on, I can't find the reservation book\"; \"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question\"; \"I'll have my manager call you back tonight\", etc.  Another 2-3 days lingered and naturally I was beginning to get irritated by this EXTREMELY FLAWED SYSTEM of theirs.  I was finally put into contact with a seemingly helpful, friendly manager named Charles who at the time, apologized profusely for the situation at hand.  He confirmed my date and even gave me his personal cell phone number to stay in touch if I had any remaining questions leading up to the party.  Well, a week before the party I decided to give good ole Charles a call to make sure everything was set.  After leaving a voicemail, I didn't hear back from him until nearly 10 hours later.  When he did call back he told me he couldn't find my name or reservation (now granted, he was the one who confirmed this with me over the phone just 3 weeks prior).  He proceeded to tell me he needed a half hour or so to figure things out (suspicious, right? Right.)  It was an hour later when he called back and dropped the ultimate bomb saying that the reservation was gone and there was nothing he could do about it since the remaining space was booked up.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!  He even had the audacity to admit that the event planning team was as fault because they didn't follow up with me leading up to the party to finalize the exact details (all the while acting cool as a cucumber as if this wasn't a real problem).  APPARENTLY THESE ARE ALL MINOR DETAILS THAT ARE NOT PERTINENT IN THE WORLD THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN. Just flabbergasting.    I think you can guess how irate I was at this point in time.  The lack of knowledge, disorganization, and mere ignorance that was portrayed over a month's span is simply distasteful, infuriating, and downright deplorable.  It's really quite shameful because the atmosphere, food, and drinks at this place are top notch, but the management and employees are despicable, inexperienced, and are not suited to meet the needs of the customer whatsoever.  So disappointing.  And best believe I'll be in touch with upper management.",

We checked No Wait before we made the 15 minute drive into town and it said \"Come on in,\" but when we got there they said the wait was an hour. They admitted they were having problems with No Wait. We put our names in anyway hoping we could keep the kids busy long enough, then the hostess came over and told us she was going to get us a table because she has kids and she saw the predicament we were in. It was so nice and considerate of her. Then once seated, while we were enjoying our appetizers, the manager offered each of us adults a complimentary shot of tequila. I don't know if it was because he saw we were the only people with kids in the whole place or what, but it was a nice gesture on top of what the hostess already did for us. Beyond all of this great hospitality, the food was yet again amazing.",

The Willie salad was not your usual boring salad and I also shared my husband's tacos.  He loved the Pollo Rojo (very tender braised chicken taco) and my favorite was the Pork Belly Pastor (probably the best pork I have ever had).  Our server, Mackenzie, was friendly and helpful.   She was able to direct my husband who can food shy, to find something he would like.   We will definitely be back!",

The staff was terrific, and their quirky playlist (\"Call Up Trudy on the Telephone\" took me back to high-school days) is a nice complement to the airy, rustic decor. The chips and salsa verde are more than enough for two -- a very cheap & tasty side dish. I had two tacos, and they appeared within 2-3 minutes of ordering -- a nice bonus when time is short for lunch. As others have said, the tortillas were nothing special, and the fillings were hit-or-miss: pollo rojo was outstanding (moist, tender & flavorful), but the pork belly was a disappointment (dry, chewy & overwhelmed by hyper-sweet canned-tasting pineapple). Nonetheless, the tacos are a good deal for 4$ each, so I'll definitely be back to try the other varieties. Might try their extensive tequila menu after work one of these days, too....",
