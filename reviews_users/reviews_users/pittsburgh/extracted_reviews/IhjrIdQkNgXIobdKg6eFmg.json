    "text": "Uncle Sam's specializes in cheesesteaks, and that's all I've gotten so far during the three times that I've gone here in 3 months.  Here's the breakdown: Meat - Mediocre.  Not distinctive/nothing special. my friend and i usually grab the seasoning on the side table and season each bite we take with that seasoning + black pepper.  veggie/meat ratio = just right. this is one of the more important factors when it comes to a delicious cheesesteak, imo. you need the greens to help regulate the meatiness.  bread: a tad heavy/thick for my taste, but the fact that it doesn't get soggy satisfies me very much so. too many times, I've tasted a cheesesteak where the bread was starting to melt with the juices coming from the meat inside.  i'm also a huge fan of sweet potato fries, and i would say that they do them very well! some people cut them too short and fry them too long to the point that the sweetness got completely fried out of existence.  the thickness of the cut of each sweet potato fry, along with the length in which they fry these things for makes for a perfect sweet potato fry! i'd come here simply for the sweet potato fries. too bad you can't substitute the regular fries that come with your cheesesteak with the sweet potato fries. you have to get them separately. if you make the mistake of not realizing this and tell the cashier you want a cheesesteak with sweet potato fries, prepare to eat a lot of fries (to me, it's a dream come True until my next blood test).",

    "text": "I've had my fair share of subs.  This isn't something I'm proud of, it's merely a fact.  I've traveled through Oakland, most of the East Suburbs, Downtown, and Monroeville.  Of all the sandwiches I've enjoyed over the years, some of my favorites are being made at Uncle Sam's Subs, in Squirrel Hill.  Uncle Sam's Subs has a wide variety of selections that can be seen on their wall-mounted menu.  Among some of the offerings are: The Mediterranean ($4.15), zucchini, tomatoes, grilled onions, black olives, cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce, The Roma Vegetable Sub ($4.15), broccoli, green beans, mushrooms, zucchini, and sweet peppers, The Vegetable Florentine ($4.15), spinach, sweet peppers and fontina cheese.  If you're more of a carnivore, you can go for the Steak Sub ($4.05), The Cheese-Steak Sub ($4.30), The Pepper Mushroom Steak Sandwich ($4.65), Steak and Egg Sub ($4.30), Capicolla and Cheese Sub ($4.15), or the Chicken Cheese Steak ($4.65).  Although all of the sandwiches are good, I always opt for the \"Ultras.\"  These are pretty much the same sandwiches as above, but with extra everything!  Extra meat, cheese, toppings=extra YUM.  All of the sandwiches are prepared in front of you, on a flat grill.  The steak, chicken, or other protein is grilled, cheese melted, then the sandwich is built...fresh and tasty!  You can choose between regular or whole wheat bread for your sandwich.  I recommend the whole wheat- it has a hearty texture and great flavor.  It also helps me rationalize ingesting a few thousand calories at one sitting.  One more thing...the fries...oh the fries...they're crisp, salty, and starchy; a must if you're ordering one of these colossal sandwiches.  Uncle Sam's Subs also offers a wide variety of domestic and imported beers.  If you're a fan of good subs, give Uncle Sam's Subs a try.  The fun atmosphere and great food will likely have you coming back for more.",

The steak is cooked just right, the bread is delicious, and the fixins actually taste like something. Even more addictive than the sandwiches are the fries. I don't know what they do to them but they have that McDonalds-esque-nothing-really-special-here-but-actually-theyre-like-crack feeling. Really awesome.  The staff at both this location and the one down Forbes in Oakland are fast, efficient, and sometimes even funny.  But if you want a break from you college experience, go to this one up in Squirrel Hill. You'll see people from all walks of life, all ages, etc.   Pittsburgh has a LOT of unhealthy, greasy, delicious options. This is one of my favorites.",

Sure, you only get fries with your sub if you dine in and you'll have to go to the PNC next door to get cash to pay for your food, but once you get that sub with a pile of fries next to it, you won't care. The subs are large and can be split among two people if you aren't too hungry, but they do say they charge for refills on your soda at certain places. Someone mentioned that the fries are like crack, and this is most definitely True. They're the thin greasy kind that doesn't get all hard and nasty when they cool down, and you never really have enough of them.  I end up getting the ultra Philly cheesesteak every time I come around here. Their filet mignon sub is just alright in comparison, because it doesn't really matter if filet mignon is a more tender cut of steak if it ends up getting thinly sliced up the same. Uncle Sam's \"special\" bread definitely grows on you and is the perfect sub bread.  Regardless of its superficial shortcomings, Uncle Sam's is one of the very few reasons why I would even want to go back to Pittsburgh.",

It was lunch time but their line is pretty efficient so the wait was reasonable. I had ordered the 'hot pepper' sub, but I didn't taste or find any in my sub; I suppose they were too busy to put some on.  Uncle Sam has fresh buns, but they don't toast them, which means that the sandwich gets soggy over time (I guess if we ate in this may not have been a factor). The fries were good, a cut above (most?) every other place in the neighborhood; unfortunately they seem to use frozen fries rather than bothering to double-fry fresh potatoes (of course I've discovered that they don't always bother to do that in Belgium either). Anyway: best subs in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Strong Pre-Game Primanti's Substitue Sandwich!  Been to Pittsburgh more than a few times, and it was always the tourist trap Primanti's or what has been called the best restaurant in town Nakama Japanese.  This time I went with a suggestion from some other Pittsburghers.  Not that Primanti's or Nakama are bad at all, but it was just time for a change.  Enter: Uncle Sam's Subs.  Been around since the early 70's so you would think they know what they are doing, and they in fact do.  Don't get me wrong, you are not going to be blown away by anything they do here, but you will get a pretty damn good sandwich & fries for under $10.  I went with the cheese steak/mushrooms, and as others have said here, it will not disappoint.  Order up, sit down, they bring you the sandwich and a side of fries in minutes.   Wrap up;  Certainly not a gourmet restaurant, but a real good sandwich real quick for real cheap.  Also a lighter (a lead brick would be lighter) than a Primanti's monster!",

    "text": "I'd been sick for a few days and not up for cooking, so my boyfriend and I went in search of a cheap lunch.  Uncle Sam's, down the block, had been calling our name for weeks.  In need of big-time sustenance to help me fight the germs, I was ready for a meaty sandwich.  Inside, there was plenty of seating, and a few TVs showing the Penguins game.  The staff behind the counter was young and enthusiastic, chatting with each other and commenting on the hockey action.  We placed our orders at the far end of the counter - I got the Loaded Italian Sausage sub (comes with flavorful Italian sausage, grilled onions/peppers, and cheese).  I was confused when the girl taking my order asked if I wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Um....no.  That seems totally wrong on an Italian sausage and peppers sandwich.  My boyfriend got a Philly cheesesteak, and despite my badgering, he DID get it with tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo.  His philosophy is pretty much to get every available topping on a sandwich if it will make it more delicious.  We waited for about 10 minutes while a guy working a big grill surface browned up our meat.  It was fun to watch Taylor's cheesesteak turn from a gorgeous deep red to a delicious steaky brown.  I appreciate that they cook everything to order here, and they don't have piles of cooked meat waiting around to be thawed or microwaved or anything.  Our sandwiches were about $7 each I think, which was reasonable since the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the sandwiches were huge.  We took them home, and they were still warm when we unwrapped them.  They were both pretty good - I didn't exactly hear angels singing, but the meat was flavorful in each (and both sandwiches were definitely heavy on the meat!)  A regular size person with a normal appetite could easily get two meals out of one big sandwich.  I preferred my Italian sausage to the cheesesteak, since mine had more seasonings, the addition of grilled veggies, and no (totally boring and unnecessary lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  no!)    I was thinking 3 1/2 stars, trying to determine whether to give them an edge up or down, when my boyfriend told me that the people behind the counter making the sandwiches weren't wearing gloves?  .....blargh.  I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but he assured me that he saw the grill-guy pick up our meat with bare hands and put it on the grill.  To be fair, there were some little pieces of wax paper partially enclosing the meat, but still.  And the girl who wrapped our sandwiches did not have gloves on either, he noticed.  Maybe they work really hard to avoid directly touching the food....but still, I'd say gloves are preferable.  I'm pretty much the opposite of a germophobe, so I don't really care that much, but I think 3 stars is fair for now.  I'm sure we'll be back to try another sandwich, and if it impresses me, I think 4 stars is in their future.  WAAAAAAAY better than a Jimmy John's/Subway type place, no contest there.",

    "text": "Looking at the yelp photos of the spongy, monotexture bread cheesesteaks , I should have known not to go, but the tantalizing descriptions of beef smothered in provolone made me walk up to forbes and murray to try Uncle Sam's. I've passed by this place a million times but never thought to go in.  The space is actually one of the coziest spaces on Forbes Ave filled with dispassionate teenage workers who are probably tired of eating cheesesteak for every meal.  The fries that came with the sandwich were chewy and dimensioned like Mcdonalds fries. It was only 30 minutes after the restaurant had opened but they were served lukewarm and had lost their crisp and heat.  The beef was the blandest and driest cheesesteak beef I've ever had. No smothering merge of cheese and beef (I cried a little inside). The Great Steak Escape at the mall can do better. It was segregated from everything else, lacking any flavor, juice, or caramelized onions. The mushrooms were canned, adding no flavor to the sub. The bread was awkward because you could tell once upon a time it was good bread, but had been left out and ungrilled :o  At one point I was just picking at the second half of my sub grazing the tough surface of bread and thinking what a nice faux-leather armchair it would make.  Good sandwiches and subs are made only two ways: by accident or through rigorous iteration. As Christine O'Donnell would put it, \"The proprieters of Uncle Sam's have lost their way. They are in need of some sandwichional repentance.\"  If I'm ever craving a juicy, texturized, flavorful sub again, I'll walk down Murray to Smallman's Deli for a beautiful corned beef reuben sandwich instead.",

(if you like them thin and crispy which, to me, is perfection in a fry)  I've been going to this place since I was a teenager, so I may be a bit biased, but if you like a good deal in a great sandwich, then it's definitely the place to go. I always order the steak sub, everything but cheese, with extra fries. The bread is ALWAYS fresh. They are generous with the meat and toppings, and very fast.   The atmosphere is nothing special, but it's clean and if you can snag a spot by the window to people-watch, you won't be disappointed.   Note: I took my brother, who lives in Philly, here not long ago and he was not happy with the cheese steak. Especially with the fact that they didn't have any cheese wiz. But if you want a Philly-style cheese steak, with that weird fake cheese from a can, then by all means, go to Philly and knock yourself out. Uncle Sam's is not a Philly cheese steak place, it's a Pittsburgh sub shop, so be warned.",

They had a veggie portabella sub which caught my eye. I'm an omnivore, but was feeling like having something a little less heavy than the meat options, so I opted for this sandwich.  Big mistake! This portabella sandwich with provolone tasted more like Chinese food on a roll than anything close to an Italian sandwich. The mushrooms were fried in way too much corn oil, fully saturating the bread to the point where it couldn't be held together as a sandwich. The provolone cheese was very low quality - pretty much tasteless and did nothing for me.   I find that often sandwich shops will have a vegetarian option just for the purpose of offering herbivores something edible while their friends enjoy the \"real\" menu. The fact that a sandwich lacks meat shouldn't have to mean that it lacks flavor. If you guys are knowingly making vegetarian sandwiches that you wouldn't eat, that's not a symptom of them being veggie sandwiches but a demonstration of your lack of willingness to take the time to figure out how to make a tasty veggie option.  Figure it out!",

My go-to is the portabella, still my favorite after years.   Ketchup on the trash can door and rickety dining room tables and chairs. The back half is depressing and the window-ed front half cramped.

The subs are much tastier and filling here, but at the same time they are not overly greasy or messy like those at Primanti. If you get the options with lots of veggies or meat, you'll get what you want. One sub plus free fries will definitely fill you up for less than $10. And speaking of the fries, I actually consider them the best part. Crisp, thin-cut, and not at all soggy. Put them in your sandwiches if you want to, but I prefer mine separate, and they do that right here.",

Someone had told me about the place before I arrived on campus and after the first time I went here, I went here every day for 30 days straight.  That's right.  I ate here every day for 1 month and it never got old.  I've never had anything expect the mushroom cheese steak and it's simply the best.  They season it well and it's always delicious.    My ex from Philly took me to have a famous Philadelphia cheese steak when I was there and it couldn't compare to Uncle Sam's!  Like someone else said, who the heck puts cheeze whiz spread on a sandwich?  That's Philly for ya lol.  A couple of things that could be improved is like someone else said they used canned mushrooms which aren't bad, but aren't great.  The place could use a renovation and they could always have more friendly people taking your order.   Just last weekend I was at the Uncle Sams in Robinson and the girl who took my order there was one of the best and kindest servers to ever wait on me.  Need more servers like her!",

If I wanted to wait for a meal I'd go to a sit down restaurant with waiter service. I've been waiting 40 min for a sandwich I could get across the street at Jimmy Johns in less than 5 minutes. Don't come here unless you have nothing better to do than sit and wait for a sub-par sub.",

The workers were kind and as always the cheesesteak was plump & full of goodness. We always get the ultra mushroom cheesesteak and its delicious. One meal can be shared. Free fries when you dine in.

To the best of my knowledge this is the original location but there are others.  The employees have been there as long as I can remember and that's a testament to this company.  Consistency in employees usually means consistency in your food which creates consistency in my visits.  They have a range of subs but let's be honest, we're coming for a steak hoagie or the alternate chicken steak with peppers, onions lettuce tomato and mayo on what's possibly a hoagie roll sent from heaven.  The sit in orders come with free shoe string fries made fresh to order, if you get a order to go though, the fries are extra.  I know you're probably like, ok it's a steak sub but, it's more spiritual than physical.  It's always exactly the same and I've eaten here at least a few dozen times, any True Pittsburgher has and every out of towner should.  Other than a Roethlisburgher at Peppis or Of course a Primantis Sandwich, I think this would complete the city limits PGH triple threat sandwich staple, I know, it's debatable.

I have only been to this location and the one in the Waterworks in Aspinwall, next to another favorite place Burgatory. Uncle Sam's Submarines is located on Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill.  In my option this cheese steak is much better than any pizza shop steak hoagie and I think it is because Sam's specializes in great steak hoagies. The steaks are made in front of you, always fresh and never a so-so hoagie.  I like the fact that, If you eat in, you get free fries. I like the small thin shoestring fries, they remind me of the fries on the boardwalk. The staff here and in the Waterworks have always been friendly. I think that the price is very affordable for what you receive. The restaurant is always clean and I have never had a problem finding a seat. Yes it is CASH ONLY. Highly Recommend for a great Cheesesteak!",

And I'm not even a sub/Italian/hoagie kind of guy. Fun fact: I have lived in each of the geographic regions represented by the above three names most commonly used for Uncle Sam's delicious sandwiches.",

Why else would customers (especially college students) put up with the inconvenience? Uncle Sam's is the proof of this.  I came here a lot to order the ultra uncle sam's special and it was phenomenal. The beef is super juicy, it's loaded with cheese, onions and peppers. The bread is great and if you keep it around too long it'll soak up all of the meat juice and fall apart on your lap. But it's sooo good. And they give you all of the fries you could ever ask for.  Top notch place. It's also right by a PNC ATM (though there's an ATM inside too if you want to pay a ridiculous fee). And right by the Murray and Forbes bus stop. So good. Definitely stop by for a meal.",

But, the sweet potato fries were inedible because the oil they were cooked in was either burned or old. They smelled and tasted nasty. On top of all that, the restaurant was dirty. The tables weren't wiped down and there was food debris and condiment stains on the tables.  The worst sin was when I asked for cheese whiz on my steak and the server told me that was disgusting - by the way, that cheese sauce they serve (and charge extra for) IS cheese whiz. Never tell a former Philly girl that whiz on a cheese steak is disgusting!  I won't be back.",

Fried egg on a sandwich is a must, especially this sandwich. The bread is more chewy than crusty, but for this sandwich it works well because the bread sucks up all the juices but doesn't get soggy. I've also tried their potato and egg sandwich. Really simple, but it tastes so good and satisfying.  For some reason all of their fries (classic fries, waffle fries, sweet potato fries, etc) taste so good. They're fresh, crispy, and nicely salted.",

Service: Not necessarily the friendliest bunch but they also aren't rude! They just aren't super bubbly individuals and that's okay . Food was prepared and served quickly!  Food: Delicious!

    "text": "OVERALL: amazing fries (choose the dine-in option to get them for free) and good sandwiches. Service is slow and it's cash only, but there is an ATM in the store and a PNC nearby.  I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches, but this is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I'm a HUGE fan of their fries, which are delightfully crispy. I usually have to stop myself from finishing all the fries before I even get to my sandwich! They also give you an enormous amount of fries, which come fresh and hot.   The sandwiches themselves are also good. I usually get some form of the Italian sandwich, which has flavorful meat and a good serving of vegetables inside them as well (lettuce, tomato, peppers, onions).  However, I do have two qualms about Uncle Sam's, which is that it's cash only and the service is pretty slow. I usually only carry my credit card with me when I go out, so when I crave sandwiches and don't have cash, I have to unfortunately go elsewhere. The service is also relatively slow - my boyfriend and I once waited 15 minutes for two sandwiches, when we were the only people in the restaurant besides one person who had already gotten their food. Despite this, I still love the place, and will definitely be back!",

As far as I know, you can't get 6 inch sandwiches. They have a lot of options for vegetarians as well, and those options aren't boring! Both hot and cold subs available, and they also have a veggie burger sub which is my personal favorite. You get a choice of cheese on each sub and also lettuce, tomato, onion, and mayo. They ask each time so it's best to think it over beforehand.   The subs are served with fries and the fries are some of the best fries in town. They are shoestring type fries and go down like air which is a delicious yet dangerous combination. They are deep fried in peanut oil, so those that are allergic should be advised not to try them. They also have waffle fries and sweet potato fries. I still love the regular fries the best, however! There is a seasoning I love to put on them by the counter. Definitely recommend!",

I mean don't get me wrong, I love it here too but I didn't realize that little kids like to eat here as well.  I will say that this location is a nice prime spot. Easy to get to, a parking lot down the street and icecream down the street. I can see why the boys love it here.  This location is also bigger than it first appears. You walk in to order and there are a few seats in the front then when you look past the soda fountain there are a ton of seats in the back. Really nice to not have to worry about where to sit.  Like most Uncle Sam's you order, get your number and they bring you out the sandwiches once they are finished. This is nice especially since, with two boys, you kinda want to keep an eye on them and not what at the counter for your food.  The sandwiches come with fries and they are crispy because they are fried in peanut oil (as a warning too). I usually get extra tomatoes and onions on mine. I also only eat half my sub on most days. How can you eat more with those fries! You then just bring your basket to the front and they will wrap up your sammy and put it in a nice bag for travel.   I like coming here. It is fun and the food is good. Yummy! I say come if you need something fast and delish! Or even if you want to take your time and sit and chat. It's perfect.",

The fries are only free if you eat there - you have to order it for take out. The bacon cheeseburger is my favorite sub, but the special is pretty good as well. I hear the salads are decent, too. Cash only. Parking is best over at the lot across the street, under the library.",

Maybe it was just me but the texture and quality of the submarine bread is better in Oakland. I'm not sure what kind of sauce/spice/whatever they put on their sandwiches but they certainly add extra flavor and tastiness to the mix. Love their french fries too--they are the perfect crispiness and come in huge helpings. The sandwiches alone are giant. Eating here kept me full for the day or the leftovers lasted for two meals.",

I got the Mediterranean sub which had cheese, cucumbers, lettuce, black olives, tomatoes and several other veggies. It comes with a huge portion of fries too and they are yummy! I could not finish half of my food because it was so much, but it was fantastic! Now I know why people love this place! They remember you by what you are wearing too. Stop by and grab a sandwich if you are near one of the locations! They had a few veggie options and serve salads too.",

I never manage to get anything other than the Special Italian (with everything, naturally).  Fries are always hot but don't taste like much.  Service varies from nonchalant to downright surly, and I always feel a little sick after I eat here, just from all the grease.  Not worth a special trip, but it's a huge meal for not too much money and it tastes good.",
