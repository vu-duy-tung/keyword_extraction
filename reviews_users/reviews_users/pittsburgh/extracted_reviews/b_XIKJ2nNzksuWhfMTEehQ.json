    "text": "Love this place, hate the fact that is halfway across the country.  A definite must for beer enthusiasts.  The best selection I have seen anywhere, they have a True variety and not just a few imports.  I am a lover of Belgian Beer, and this place really hits the spot. They have an excellent selection both on tap and in bottle, though the bottle selection is larger.  Much like wine the various styles of beer have a specific glass.  Some places fail to realizes this, but not Sharp Edge.  The beer alone makes it, but the atmosphere is just the cherry on top.  Wonderful, classy, and relaxing atmosphere.  Not at all a dive, or even some swanky nose in the air joint.  Just a nice friendly place to sit back and enjoy some brew.  The food is split between typical bar fair, and honest to goodness entrees.",

There was absolutely zero broth with the mussels, very few leeks, and pale mealy tomatoes.  The frittes were plain old fries a little browner in color due to spices that I couldn't taste, and they needed salt.  There was mustard to dip them in.  The Palm beer I ordered was excellent but the food was \"meh\" at best.  Go for the beer but dine elsewhere.",

We usually get the Field Green salads with the Raspberry house-made dressing - it's made with framboise and it's amaing. My fav is the flatbread pizzas. The jerked BBQ chicken pizza is my favorite. Sharp Edge has an world-class beer selection. I knocked-off a star for service. Some nights the service is excellente. Some nights it is awful. I don't know if it's kitchen or wait staff to blame. But, more times than not, they don't have enough servers on-duty for an unexpected crowd. The trivia night is a lot of fun though. The trivia host, Mark, does a great job. Sharp Edge Creekhouse is a lot of fun, great atmosphere if you like a ski lodge, laid back vibe.",

    "text": "I have been to this location twice recently - once of lunch and once for dinner - honestly I would say skip it. The service at lunch was extremely slow - I was there with a coworker - we both got sandwiches (one of which was not prepared the way that we asked for it) and it took almost 45 to an hour to get food with the place empty with the exception of two other people. I went for dinner to give it another shot - first strike was that the draft list wasn't up to date (or even close) and the server didn't even know what was on draft - you are a place that specializes in beer - know your products to be able to sell them. The food is just ok - nothing bad but nothing I couldn't live without. I guess what bothers me the most about both visits is that the service has been subpar at best. Prior to the last 5-6 years I would have said that Sharp Edge would be one of the better beer selections in the city - now there are plenty of other places you can find a great selection of beer with better atmosphere and service.",

(i had considered it only with portabello mushrooms, but i'm glad i got the nicoise!) we're planning on where to go in october. any suggestions??? we'll be at the roller derby, i know that much! go steel city girlz!!!",

I had stopped in to this place with friends to have a drink, and despite being a little put off by the servers, I came back because they usually have a really nice selection of beers.  My first mistake was to order anything from the kitchen.  My second mistake was to take my wife there and meet with some friends, and order something from the kitchen.  Bottom line - the kitchen, the people who plan the menu, the wait staff, and probably the kitchen manager are basically clueless about food and food service.  If you want to try an unusual beer that you have never tried before (beware, some of them are pretty nasty and they no longer seem to want to give you a \"sample\" cup before you order) and you don't mind spending a LOT of money for an unusual beer, by all means stop by and check out.

    "text": "\"Where to Find the Best Belgian Beer Bar in North America\".  Well, I can't comment on that because I'm a non-drinker.  I was out in Crafton doing a site visit for work and thought I'd stop in here for some lunch.  I have to say I love the building this place is in.  It does look like an old creekhouse.  I've been by this place before and I'm pretty sure it's been other things.    So I sat myself down, opened the menu, and --yow!-- the prices here are a little steeper than I thought they might be!  Oh well, it was getting past lunchtime and Susan's tummy was talking to her!  I was looking at the appetizers and I saw the Belgian Pomme Frites.  Yikes!  That thing probably could feed five.  I was also thinking about some soup and I noticed the Hop Devil Potato.  \"Creamy cheddar cheese soup spiked with Victory Hop Devil (whatever that is), loaded with tender potatoes and served in a sourdough bread bowl.\"  That's not just soup, that's a meal!  For two, it seems!    So I went for the Rueben, figuring that wouldn't be so ginormous and even if it was, I could get half to go.  It didn't disappoint and I did end up taking half of it with me.  My sandwich was good though.  I give Sharp Edge a solid three stars because:  Pro:  Excellent atmosphere in a pretty building. Semi Pro:  Food is good, but it's typical bar fare. Con:  Kind of pricey.",

    "text": "Here is my second bad review I have written and oddly enough it for another Sharpe Edge location.  See my review of the Brasserie  in Peters Township to learn of that most embarrassing situation.   I have been a fan of the Sharp Edge since the mid 1980s when my friend Scott and I went almost weekly for about 5 years and enjoyed tasting what was at that time the only wide ranging beer taps in Pittsburgh.  In the past year I have had bad experiences at three different Sharp Edge locations.  In this review I will only discuss the extremely embarrassing situation at the Creekhouse.  Wow what a mess this was.  First, the server never came around, often waiting 15 minutes for him to acknowledge our existence.  Interesting that the manager finally started waiting on when we complained, but he was no better.   I ordered an appetizer for my wife since she was coming from work and asked for it to be made immediately. After another 15 minute wait he stopped by again and asked if we wanted the appetizer to go in????  We were waiting insufferably long to get our drinks refilled and quite frankly, ignored.   Of course they also have the NEW policy of no samples for beer.  Another reason o go elsewhere for your $8.00 beer.    My friend had called around 4:30PM to learn if there was a lenten fish special, the person on the phone told about the $11.99 Friday Fish special.  When we got there we learned from the manager that the special was only for lunch and that we would be paying $15.99 for the fish.  He went on to tell us that \"no one would have told you that the special was $11.99 for dinner\".   I truly enjoy being called a liar by the manager in front of friends.    We paid our bill and left and went up the road on 60 to Butyas where the fish sandwich was huge and delicious and the server was awesome!   By the way, no one called us liars there either!      A quick note on their food.  I have never been a fan of their food except for the white pizza.  In recent years they have industrialized their food, pre-making it in a central kitchen.  It is substandard even by basic bar food standards and   it is EXTREMELY overpriced.   Sorry Sharp Edge, no more second (third) chances.",

I admit I'm a bit of a beer snob, but when my wife and I go out its gonna take more than a great beer selection to keep us coming back. With menu selections to the likes of Elk and other fine ingredients you'd think the food would be better. Honesty if you're gonna have it, give it some justice. Or like another yelper mentioned slim down your menu and do it very well... ... P.S. after having drunk a Pumpkin ale that had soured, for their July \"mystery beer\".

The first time was mediocre but the second time is a bit more fresh in my mind.   I love beer! I wish I didn't love beer so much but I have tried to not drink on mondays so this is a \"non-drinking review\", for once.   It was gorgeous on monday so we decided to sit outside on their patio with a beautiful view of an underpass...(its pittsburgh not Maui, I understand)   Service was a little spotty in even though we had two servers but it was a beautiful night and we weren't in a rush. I am always trying to eat healthy (summer is coming) but this was challenging at this spot. I ended up with the mediterranean ground chicken burger with feta and a salad. Pretty good (I ate the whole thing) but something was a little off. I don't think I would get it again.  Something about their menu intrigues me but there is always some that throws off an option for me. I think if I go back I might switch to drinking my dinner here.  PRO: Outdoor seating, beer list, friendly service (although spotty)  CON: Limited wine list, menu kinda misses with me, not many healthy options, strange lingering creek smell, spotty service, not a cheap bill when we all just got sandwiches  Overall: Might go back for light apps and drinks not dinner tho",

The bartender was our server, and he was able to man the bar and tables. Everything was awesome. I am a very picky eater, and he was able to order the food for me the way that I wanted it.   We recently went back and sat on the patio hoping to get the same kind of service. When we presented another coupon, the waitress obviously wrote us off. The funny thing is, is that with a coupon we are better tippers! We were forced to order off of a limited (more expensive) menu. I asked to have my food cooked plain, without extra calories from dressing and sauce, and no matter what I tried to order, it could not be modified. I ended up getting the Mahi, which if I didn't need to watch my weight would have been delicious. However, with medical issues, I am unable to eat certain things. The waitress told me that it had to be cooked in the soy marinade, but on top of that, it was loaded with an alfredo/mayo kind of sauce. Talk about calories galore! I tihink that she told the chef to pile it on. I ate none of it.   The atmosphere is nice, and the beer list is okay if you like Belgium beers. They do not offer anything light except for Amstel Light. The server tonight had way too many tables, and seemed to focus on larger groups. We have decided to \"write the restaurant off.\" We have both worked in the restaurant industry for many years, and we were dissapointed in the date night experience. If my meal wasn't half price, I would have sent it back, and I have never in my life complained about a meal.",

The very friendly waitress was overworked since she was the only one there to take care of every table. The biggest surprise was the calamari fries. lightly breaded, cooked to perfection and ,brace yourself, not rubbery. they were delicious and tender.

There was a dirty chalkboard with some listed beers using low-contrast colors, like blue on black.  We weren't even in the same room as the chalkboard, so it was doubly impractical to read.  So we asked our server what beers they had on tap.  Her answer: Go look at the tap handles.   Give me a break.  Aside from that incident, she was pretty inattentive overall.  The food menu indicated a special garlic section.   The shredded pork sandwich description invoked a vision of roasted garlic cloves spread thinly on the roll, and it would come with garlic frites.  Sounds delicious, right?   What I got was a pretty standard pork sandwich with a huge glop of garlic-flavored grainy-fake-cheese tasting paste.  And the frites?  Standard steak fries from a freezer bag with a huge glop of garlic-flavored grainy-fake-cheese tasting paste.",

Having been numerous times I have come to appreciate that Belgian beers are so much more then too sweet beer I had tried at parties a couple of times.  And half off Belgian beers during happy hour is the perfect time for your own education!    OTOH, I can't think of a single thing on the menu to compliment.  Even the french fries leave me disappointed, looking nicely browned, but then somehow managing to be limp and lame.  The pizza should just be removed from the menu entirely or at least renamed so it is not confused with real pizza.  Cut the menu down by half and focus on making the best bar food in town that can live up to the great staff and beer selection.  Thanks",

I ordered sliders.  2 were over cooked to the point of being burnt around the edges.  The other was not even a burger!  It was 2 small pieces of meat rolled into balls and barely cooked.

As this place is renowned for its selection of Belgian beers, it balances a nice variety on the menu of typical bar food with a touch of flair.  My personal favorite is the Venison Cheeseburger that makes any 3 hour morning sales meeting seem worth it.  Sharp Edge has daily specials and I personally get giddy over the pierogies and sausage.  A typical favorite through these snowy days is the soup salad combo with cup of Irish coffee.    Overall the service is good, the staff are nice and i haven't had a bad experience.  There is a covered deck for outdoor dining and an upstairs dining room for those busy nights.  As for the beer selection...let me just say that i make it a point to bring all my hopheads and beer junkies to Sharp Edge simply for the selection and to talk beer.",

The buffalo bites are a solid appetizer as well as the sweet potato fries.  The beer selection is what will bring you back to this restaurant.  The menu is pretty pedestrian, prices are about $1 too expensive for what you get compared to other places of the same quality (but if you go during happy hour and get half off your beer, it all evens out).  There are burgers, sandwhiches, paninis, pizza and a few entrees.  My mother who has a limited view of food thought there were some strange things, but I didn't find anything I would consider strange.  Service is typically average, but they know their beers well and will help you find a new beer you will like.",

We've tried a lot of the menu and enjoy most everything we've tasted.  Not sure I'd order the mussels with the blue cheese and black pepper again, but they were all eaten.  Our youngest son gives it a \"thumbs up\" and he's a tough customer and tough reviewer of a burger.  He's a fan and our family likes the deck at this friendly stop.",

    "text": "When you sit at the stoplight in front of Sharp Edge Creekhouse in Crafton and see HAPPY HOUR HALF OFF BELGIAN DRAFTS scrolling across their neon marquee, consider it a homing beacon that is (and should be) completely impossible to ignore.  Just sit at the bar that looks like it could be located on an Alpine Ski Slope & sample some truly amazing Belgian beers. The bartenders will be happy to educate you if you're a novice and let you sample until you've found something you'll love.  Personally, I fell hard for a Corsendonk Abbey Brown Ale that it turned out I could only afford if it was 1/2 off - cases of that stuff at Save on Beer run over $100!  But, it was a pure delight.   The happy hour was our 2nd stop at Sharp Edge. We'd done lunch and beers there previously with a less happy experience than our happy hour. The only things memorable about our lunch was that it was underwhelming on flavor and service and our bill seemed too high for the experience. We'd each had 2 beers with lunch and I guess at regular pricing those can add up quicker than we thought. Plus we didn't sit at the bar to receive the bartender's guidance in our selections and that's really one of the best things they do there.  Lesson: Don't pass up happy hour & make sure you sit at the bar. Not bad advice, in general!",

Management came over very quickly to let me know they would put in the right order and it was on the house.  The experience I had there was good.

    "text": "It's bar food, but it is bar food magnifique, and before I say anything else, I will thank Dan, a dear friend from way, way back and beer connoisseur for bringing Kay and I here prior to the magnificent Mastodon/Opeth/Ghost gig that occurred Sunday evening.  Let me also immediately knock off a star for the rubbery (frozen?) calamari that served as our appetizer.  After said letdown was cleared from the road, the rest of the meal became one glorious, top-down cruise, even for someone like myself who abstains from the demon alcohol.   If you've ever been to one of the Sharp Edge franchises or have had a gander at their menu, you know that I was in a burger Shangri-La.  I for one knew little about SE going in other than that they specialize in beer, but when Dan mentioned that they serve ostrich burgers...a tingle shot up my backbone and into my brain. I'd never even thought of sampling this warrior-bird before, let alone in ground meat form.   Now, the patty is not pure ostrich. Minced sirloin is mixed into the ostrich to keep it from being \"gamey\" I suppose and to add some fat to the proceedings. Caramelized red onion, black pepper, pepperjack cheese, and dijon mustard are included as well as the standard tomato, onion, lettuce, dill pickle chips (nice ones at that) but wait...ancho chile mayonnaise you say?  The addition of artichoke hearts was my wacky idea, and I ended the modifications right there. This burger had its specific build for a reason, so despite the customization options, I trusted the chef, for the most part.   Uhh...*stammering* I really don't know how to describe the meat.   In all seriousness, my mind is an empty, white room at this moment.   Well...*deep breath* I must make an attempt, no?   Lean, wild, fierce, alien, it was a cheetah whose DNA was spliced with that of a gamecock by a perversely martial genetic engineer, killed in a jousting match, put through a grinder, and grilled to a dead-on medium rare, which like the  artichoke hearts, was also my idea. I have finally learned of the ideal temperature for burger supremacy, and it is to know Canaan.   Ah, I forgot to mention the cushiony, luxuriously toasted Kaiser bun that made the entire burger possible. My thumbs left deep impressions in the bread when I first picked it up. Juices dripped from the burger onto the plate as if it was a freshly gashed and squeezed lemon. Yet the bread would not disintegrate despite its comforting flexility. Dan laughed approvingly, knowing instantly before I did, before I took bite one, that my decisions were borne of sheer gastronomic guile and a willingness to gamble, experiment.   Exotic proteins were tamed by both the sugared allium only to be riled by the acid of the mustard and riled again by the pepperjack and riled further by that gorgeous, vibrant orange aioli. Each chomp contained a lifetime's worth of flavors that I've only begun to paint a word portrait of and have failed miserably at.   It was to eat a burger from another world. To pass on it and simply opt for a standard sirloin would have been cowardly and tragic.   The Belgian Frites were a mass of deep-fried potato virtuosity. Crumbly and luminously flaxen of jacket, each tater stave revealed a muggy, downy core that indicated a mastery and passion for the preparation of french fries. These were not merely blanched, these were cooked, wholly.   And with that, my burger weekend had begun and ended winningly. I could have ended my meal then and there without regret, but I coveted, craved The Belgian Chocolate Pudding.   As the goblet of creamed cocoa iniquity was placed before me by our waitress Johanna, Dan stated, \"Maaan, that ain't Swiss Miss out of a packet.\" Nor was it Jello. Bill Cosby would mosh, not dance, if he ate this.   Nor was it made by Hershey. Profoundly chocolatey, the Callebaut, imported from Belgium, made its presence known throughout the entirety of my mouth, telling me through telepathy--and this chocolate was as alive and darkened as the Venom symbiote--that I was enjoying superior chocolate, the finest in all the globe. A chocolatier, a specialist, concieved this chocolate, and the pudding, which must be classed as the greatest I have ever consumed, was merely a way to showcase it. Whoever crafted this pudding has reclaimed what has been corrupted by mass production, vending machines, and lunch hour. Not that they were at all necessary, but whipped cream, roasted almond shards, a raspberry sauce, and a pirouline, that most addictive of canned, cylindrical wafers (and I will eat a can of 'em), acted as swell embellishments.  Sometimes you just need to listen to people who care about you, who know you, and know what you love to eat in order to find a satisfying meal. After all, whatever did we do before Yelp?   P.S. Expert beer drinker Dan adored his beer. He also loves Church Brew Works. So to the snobs, I thumb my nose.   P.P.S. Kay's Curry Mussels were A-1. 'Nuff said.",

They have late nite food specials as well, and the food is again, only worth it after 10 pm. The bites are served on a fiesta ware plate, bare and never cooked correctly, not done or overdone. They charge for ranch or blue cheese-really? No, let's talk about the service. COMPLETELY UNDERSTAFFED. ALL. THE. TIME. Believe me, I've not just been there a couple of times.

    "text": "What a disappointment! This past Friday night, my girlfriend and I planned to stay close near home because of the harsh, cold weather we were having. -18 was the wind chill to be exact. Not ideal weather so we wanted to get a good, quick bite to eat and head in for the evening. The Creekhouse in Crafton dampened our plans.   Being that we have been to this location a few times before, we felt comfortable there and basically knew what we were looking for. Creekhouse is a 2 minute drive and we have been attempting to make this one of our local favorites! Somewhere that is close, has good food and decent service. We wanted that to be Sharp Edge, unfortunately it did not go as planned.   My GF ordered a crispy chicken sandwich that was advertised with avocado and bacon. I got the fish sandwich special, which came with sweet potato fries and I got cheese added to the order. When the food arrived, my fish was missing the cheese and my GF's sandwich was missing the bacon. Not a huge deal. Everyone makes mistakes, so we had the waitress fix this, and it was all good! Our waitress was kind and helpful for the most part.   Then, we asked for a check and it all went downhill from there. We had a gift card and a coupon we wanted to use. Our family knows how much we like supporting local businesses so they gifted us a coupon book and a gift card for Christmas! So after 3 checks were printed (obviously wrong) the waitress tells us that she charged our $50 gift card and there was $0.83 left on it. A huge red flag because we order two $10 sandwiches and 2 drinks! After we made the waitress aware of this, she then said the manager was coming out to resolve the issue. We waited 15 minutes for the manager! I know it was 15 because I timed it.   All in all we were at this Creekhouse location for 2 hours! I have never experienced such bad service at a so called place of business in my life! This takes the cake. We planned on having a quick fun bite to eat at a local place and this location ruined it! I wouldn't recommend eating here at all! The single worst part about our trip to the Creekhouse, was the manager offered 0 compensation! Nothing! I explained how they messed our order and he still did not apologize for anything! Even freakin' McDonalds would offer you a free drink if they messed up your order, not at Sharp Edge. He did nothing but allow two upset and disappointed customers to walk out the door.   My girlfriend and I still have $15 bucks remaining on our gift card, but I highly doubt will be revisiting a Creekhouse any time soon.",

    "text": "On a frigid Friday night there is nothing better to do than to stay local and eat some good food. This was exactly what my boyfriend and I planned to do by going to Sharp Edge Creekhouse tonight.  Having been here before, I had a fairly average impression but remembered the food being pretty tasty with slow-ish service. We ordered the spanakopita appetizer and two drinks and it took a few minutes longer than most, but was absolutely delicious.  We have a coupon book that includes a Creekhouse buy one get one sandwich, salad, or burger coupon up to $12 in value, so we both ordered sandwiches for dinner. I got a fried chicken avocado sandwich, and according to the menu it came with pesto sauce, avocado, bacon, and Swiss. When I got it, there was no bacon or Swiss but there was a big slice of American cheese on it.  My boyfriend ordered their fish sandwich and added a slice of cheese to it. We both subbed our side with sweet potato fries for $1 extra. His sandwich came with no cheese, and I'm thinking our waitress may have mistaken our order.   We got our check and asked for it to be split with drinks on one order and food on another. We waited and waited and our check finally came. The waitress said she took $12 off for our BOGO coupon but only took $6 off. I try to be patient, but this started to make us feel slightly disgruntled as service seemed to slow as the night went on.   We asked for a corrected check but we were overcharged by a significant amount. Again we waited a decent while, enough to make anyone a bit annoyed. Our waitress passed by several times looking past us with plates of food for other patrons. After nearly 15 additional minutes we asked to speak with a manager and were told he was working on our checks and that it was difficult to get separate checks.  The manager eventually came out and greeted us. He listened to my explanation of what had happened and gave us the receipt that reflected our horribly misconsTrued dining experience here. Unfortunately, I would not say I'd like to go here again.",

We were both surprised how good it was. Didn't care for the cucumber basil mojito; think I need to stick with the fruit ones. Just had to try the made from scratch Belgian chocolate pudding.  While it tasted good it doesn't strike me as pudding.  It comes out looking like a scoop of ice cream and is very thick.  Very sweet too. Hubby said the cheesecake tasted frozen and they put too much raspberry sauce on it.",

At that point I knew I would be ordering another beer.  I could hardly wait, I think I may have guzzled my first beer so I could get to the Hacker Pschorr and enter nirvana.

To be honest, I always kind of forget that it exists because it sits on it own kind of hidden. \"Creekhouse\" is a great name for this location, because that is exactly what it resembles on the inside & outside!   Both times that I went to the Creekhouse, we were seated in the downstairs restaurant area. The atmosphere inside is just OK- as many others have said it has a bit of a lodge-y type feel. It could use some updating in my opinion, but there is something about it that is very charming. Everyone who works here also seems to be very nice & the service was pretty fast! This is a great place to come if you love beer. They have a ton of beers on tap- I am not much of a beer connoisseur- so I asked the waitress to help me choose one based off of what I liked. I forget the name of the beer she suggested but it was blueberry flavors & delicious. Chris also ordered an IPA that he didn't love too much.   For our meal, we were craving wings so we started out with the buffalo bleu wings. I am not too much of a blue cheese dressing kinda gal, but these wings might have converted me! I wish we would have gotten another flavor wing as well! For dinner, I ordered the grilled chicken & avocado sandwich with the arugula creaser salad as my side. This was just OK for me- nothing really special about it & probably something I could have made at home. Chris ordered the shrimp salad for his dinner- which was also just OK. The dressing was a citrus vinaigrette and it was sooo tangy! I am sure we will be back to visit Creekhouse while we still live in the neighborhood, but it wouldn't be a place that I would go completely out of my way to eat at.",

The bar area is nice and cosy and the bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. They have a really good list of craft beers and some really good specials. During Pirates games you get a special price on a local ale, and prices in happy hour are half off on all craft beers and Belgians. I got a really good IPA and a porter along with the local ale that you get the special on during Pirates games.   I had the chicken avocado sandwich, which was really good and comes with fresh cut fries--you could tell they were cut from fresh potatoes and not frozen--they were really good.   There was a well placed screen playing the Pirates game, and they had good audio from the game playing.   This is really a nice place for a beer drinker and to have a good meal.",

My roommate that used to live nearby talks about this place and their chicken salad sandwich regularly and as others have mentioned, options for dining in the area are pretty limited. I was craving a burger/bar food and thought it would be the perfect opportunity.  It sits by itself and looks like a house-turned-restaurant. When we walked in, it was cozy and lodge-ish - not modern or fancy, and there was a small dining room plus a bar behind it.  I believe there is an upstairs as well, although we didn't see it.  We were seated quickly at a booth next to the bar where we could see they had a lot of beers on tap.  The happy hour special was running from 2-4 and included half price drafts and $.55 wings.  Bobby got a Southern Tier and we ordered a dozen wings - 6 in the buffalo bleu sauce and 6 of the dry Cajun rub. They came out crispy as we'd requested and were soooooo good. The buffalo bleu was my favorite!!!  I ordered the salmon Caesar salad albeit wanting to stuff my face with a burger, and of course, Bobby chose the build-your-own burger and loved it.  My salad was good. Standard lettuce, cheese, no croutons and salmon.... but I would definitely opt for one of their sandwiches next time.  Creekhouse got the W from Bobby and I would certainly come back if we are nearby in the future.   Service was good and atmosphere was pleasant (moreso when the rowdy group next to us left) and I like that they offer 'happy hour' specials on the weekend.  Definitely a place to check out if you're looking for good bar food, decent prices and a variety of beers.",

    "text": "Although I live a few blocks away and eat out often, I rarely go the the Sharp Edge Creekhouse anymore. It used to be a favorite, but it seems like both the food and the service slip every time I go there. Today was no exception. Had something from the Octoberfest menu. The pork was ok, but drowned in the sauerkraut which was not the way I'd wanted the meal. Why wouldn't that be served separate?  The spaetzle was tasteless. The order took forever for a hot table dish and some potato pancakes. Not worth the price and I had to wander the restaurant looking for anyone to refill our drinks.   My lunch companion had suggested it and I don't believe either of us will return.   Please fix this restaurant. I eat at the other Sharp Edge locations more than the one down the street. Update the menu and fix the service. Please.",
