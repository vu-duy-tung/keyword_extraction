We had an open bar for three hours to go along with the food and Lisa waited on us and hustled up and down the stairs all night. All in the total cost was reasonable and we all had a blast. Definitely recommend the lot for your next party of 20 to 25 people.",

There are many restaurants in Bloomfield, but for the most part they are at best inconsistent, but mostly just serve terribly crappy Italian food.  Lot 17 is a bar with well above average bar food and a pretty damn good choice of beer.   This is my go to place, when all else fails, when I cant take one more shitty meatball,  and I want food that I KNOW is going to be solid, I head to Lot 17.",

Knowing that large happy hour events can sometimes put a strain on business for restaurants and bars, I always appreciate when managers and/or employees meet our requests with a friendly attitude and a sense of understanding. Lot 17 worked with us to plan this mixer for our members, and they were extremely accommodating and eager to help us make the event a success. The upstairs space is the perfect setting for a small to medium-sized gathering, and the appetizers we ordered were delicious. I will definitely look at holding future events at Lot 17, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to eat and drink in the city.",

I used to live in Florida and survived on Mahi Mahi salads, sandwiches, and blackened fillets...   At lot 17 I am always ordering the blackened Mahi sandwich no bun with veggies,(usually broccoli or beans). This is a highly flavorful and tender good sized; piece of fish that had no fishy flavor. One of the mildest white fish. I have eaten it on the bun and it is very tasty too. The blackening can be a bit heavy and chard so if you don't like that burnt taste you may want to have it grilled. That spicy kick and filling but healthy selection keeps me going throughout the busiest of days!",

    "text": "Hey, wanna meet me for a beer?  Sure, where do you wanna go?  You should really have an easy answer to that question when someone asks you, but lately I haven't.  I've lived in Bloomfield for two years now, and have yet to identify \"my spot.\"  I love the neighborhood -- great restaurants, bars, local business, art spaces, etc.  I like several of the bars, but just haven't figured out which is my go-to spot.    Last night I asked a friend to meet me for a beer and she suggested Lot 17.  It is literally right around the corner from me.  (And when I say literally, I do NOT mean \"figuratively,\" which so many people do, by accident I suppose, but they're saying exactly the opposite of what they mean! Grrr)  It's right around the corner, and since I had actually never been in, I thought it was a perfect choice.  The first thing you notice is the classy wooden decor.  Everything is all really nice hardwood.  It has a very simple style -- the traditional wood, simple chalk board beer list, a couple of nice HD TVs -- none of which stands out or tries too hard to grab your attention.  The bar and a few tables are in the front while several more tables for dining line the back area.  It was nearly empty.  We were there late -- from about 10-11pm -- on a freezing cold Tuesday night.  A young couple sat quietly at the bar, another guy in the corner chatted up the bartender, and I grabbed a seat a little further down the bar.  I ordered a Full Pint Festivus draft, which is a great brown ale from a brewery in North Versailles that I've heard wonderful things about.    After a few sips my friend came in and joined me.  She had a Guiness, I had another Festivus, we chatted about this and that.  It was quiet, low key, and comfortable.  It's a place that looks really nice yet had a friendly almost dive-y vibe.  I was only there for an hour and no one else was really there, so I shouldn't jump to conclusions.  However, I will definitely be plopping myself down at that classic bar again in the near future, and who knows, maybe Lot 17 will become my neighborhood go-to spot for grabbing a beer on a whim.  There was a new, shiny, fancy looking, electronic jukebox that I will definitely have to give a try next time!  And obviously I will have to eat there in the future, as I'm seeing several other great reviews",

    "text": "My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon, and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos.  The pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING.  This appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem.  Entree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \"wet\" and the Mac and cheese as \"play-doh\". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich.  Entree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream.  These only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalapeno peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot. The service was quite friendly, so, no fault there. The chef, however, needs a bit of training.",

The actual bar is unique and actually pretty cool on the inside. I don't know what I would call it, but it seemed to have a sports bar-esque feel to it. The bar food is pretty good and there is a good beer selection, and it seems to attract a diverse group of people.  One thing I do remember is having to trek upstairs and walk a bit to the bathroom, which was a little odd. Otherwise, a pretty nice place to stop in sometime for some grub and a beer.",

The look of the place is pretty decent with your standard bar seating but with the nice addition of an outdoor seating area which is great to people watch on the bussling streets of Bloomefield.  I arrived last of my party and was starving, thankfully the group had ordered sweet potato fries that came with an amazing cinamon butter for dipping!! And here's where things went south- like I mentioned before I arrived starving and we did not see our waitress for a good 10-15 minutes. When the waitress finally arrived I ordered a diet coke which came out 5-10 minutes later and tasted flat (come on people! Change the machine!) The next time the waitress appeared I quickly ordered the tuna steak salad with cilantro lime dressing which was actually pretty good- it contained won ton strips, a pretty well done piece of tuna which I asked for medium, and an assortment of what tasted to be pretty fresh vegatables.   As we wrapped up the evening and received our checks we realized that the waitress didn't give me a bill but instead took it upon herself to add my salad to someone else's tab at my table without their heads up.   Sadly to say even though my salad was pretty decent, I'm going to have to give them just an ok review due to the terrible service..Here's to Lot 17..I hope you redeem yourself.",

Wood everywhere and one of the most amazing dual ceiling fans I've ever seen right over the bar.  The food is a surprising departure from regular bar food. Between the mahimahi sandwich with the amazing pineapple mayo spread or the salad with grilled tuna steak and homemade dressing you can't go wrong.

As far as apps go,  I tried the pot roast nachos this past weekend and if anyone is familiar with Atrias version (which is awesome-check those out too), this version is highly comparable. The jalepenos add a nice kick and the chips didn't become overly soggy from the meat, which was very tender. Sour cream and salsa are served on top and an order is huge-easily feeds 4 people.  They have a couple of new sandwiches as well, a roasted Italian vegetable sandwich (I did not try this so can't really speak on the quality) and a smothered pot roast sandwich described as pulled short ribs with a marsala mushroom and onion sauce topped with swiss cheese on a rustic roll. This was so juicy and flavorful and plenty to eat the next day too. There's also a new southwest turkey wrap (lettuce,tomato, corn salsa, fresh turkey, bacon and chipoltle ranch). The chipotle ranch added just the right amount of kick and I loved that the turkey they used was of the carvery style. I took half of this home and it was good reheated the next day. They also have a new short rib mac and cheese entree and a pretzel crusted salmon dish, one of which I will be getting on my next visit. Service was excellent as usual-Adrienne, whom I'd never had as a server there before, was quick to continuously serve with a smile. And it wasn't overly crowded on a Saturday night which was another plus. I'll return most likely sooner than later.",

You can sit at any of a few high top tables, at the bar, or back in the back of the bar at a few booths.   I've tried a few different appetizers in the few years I've been coming here. Standouts to me were the fried zucchini and the fried cheese wedges. These are somehow are leaps and bounds more delicious than any other fried goodies I've ordered at a bar. I've ordered a few different veggie options of entrees, of which they have a few tasty choices. The veggie burger is amazing, the veggie pita is nice crunchy mix of grilled veggies and asiago (mmm), and my new obsession is the Lot 17 salad, which I had never tried until recently. Wowwwwww. Huge portion, fresh berries, feta, fried leeks (!!!!), and a very fresh raspberry vinaigrette.   Do yourself a favor, order anything. It's ALL good. But don't skip the fries. The regular fries are good. But I have no idea why you'd get those when you could get the cajun fries. They taste like the Andy Capp Hot Fries that you used to be able to get by the bag (I have no idea if you still can, don't really care, these are better). Spicy and crispy and a nice accent to whatever you choose. Not your thing? Then the sweet potato fries should be perfect for you. So. Freaking. Good. And the brown sugar/butter sauce they are served with is like crack. I've tried to duplicate it at home with little success. Worth the trip alone. I'm salivating right now.   The staff is always friendly and helpful, service is usually great. A few TVs line this place so it's a good place to watch a game. I'd watch anything there if it was served with a side of that sweet potato fry sauce.",

Of course I make sure to get all the toppings I can, they all seem to go nicely on that kaiser roll.  Side of fries is a must albeit it is hard to decide which type to choose from.  Regular old fries, sweet potato fries or Cajun fries, it's so hard to pick the right one (or maybe an excuse to come back again and again and pair it up differently).  One thing that I always definitely do here is find the Pittsburgh Earthquake crack.  Not much is out there information wise for this event, but I always make sure to find it.",

    "text": "I am hoping that my experience here was an off night. I came with a couple friends for puzzle pint (super fun bar puzzle event, which I highly recommend because luckily it changes locations monthly), and we sat upstairs for that event. There was only one waitress on for the whole restaurant, upstairs and down. I felt really bad for her at first, because I've waited tables before and had that happen to me and it is no bueno. I ordered a draft cider and nachos with no sour cream, husband ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries after reading all the great reviews. Waitress brings me a beer, I tell her I asked for a cider, she says \"that is a cider.\" No ma'am, it's a beer, not even close. I get that mistakes happen but please don't tell me I don't know the difference. She gives me a huge sigh and says she will take it back. Eleven minutes pass and I get my cider without any kind word from waitress. Another twenty six minutes pass and husbands food comes. Regular fries, and the whole thing is stone cold, as if it had been sitting out a while. He is too hungry to complain, doesn't want to annoy obviously in the weeds waitress, so he eats it (husband will eat anything). Another seven or so minutes and I get my nachos, giant dollop of sour cream right on top. I ask to send it back, she says in an incredibly mean tone that it'll be a while to remake it, as if daring me not to send it back. I let her know I was happy to wait, that we will be here a while with the puzzles, and it's just fine. Well not two minutes later, back come the nachos, with the sour cream partly scraped off and then covered up with cold salsa. The whole dish is as cold as if it had been refrigerated, completely soggy, and honestly just inedible. No one comes for twenty minutes (I had just given up on eating at this point) so eventually I took them downstairs myself and returned them to the bartender as waitress was nowhere to be found. Once again, no apologies, just an accusatory \"why are you bringing these back?\" I tried to explain, but he snatched the plate out of my hand and walked away.   I get it, I've been totally in the weeds before, but that means you need to be at least a little bit nice to your customers. Both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile. I can't even really review the food, since what was served to both my husband and I was too cold and soggy to be worth eating. With all the bar choices around this area, I'd suggest going to one that knows how to treat its customers.",

Nothing to necessarily write home about, but whenever my boyfriend and I need a meal in a pinch we head here.  The service is always great- fast and friendly- and the prices are more than reasonable for what you get.  Some of my favorites on the menu are the buffalo chicken sandwich, blackened mahi sandwich (ask for extra seasoning!), and the reuben.  The homemade chips and cajun fries for sides are great compliments to anything on their menu.  For an extra incentive to try it out, you can purchase a $50 \"hot card\" for just $25 through PG Daily Deals (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeals.post-gazette.com%2F&s=88548b7c9cc38e8fc19888d44c597624fa2bf7472d7d9a4cc8a85dfbd69cc0f1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">deals.post-gazette.com</a>) and use it here or at any one of about 30 participating restaurants... just look for whatever restaurant they are featuring with the hot card to get one!",

The minute I walked in I was greeted and the bartender/owner was very nice and recommended a great beer even giving me a sample first.  Everyone in the whole place, patrons and staff alike were pleasant and polite and nice to talk to.  It was a very enjoyable experience. I've had their pretzels and they are DELICIOUS.  I'm very excited to try their other food.  I will definitely be going back.  UPDATE: I have had more of their food and it all holds up.  When I'm in the mood for french fries this is where I go.  Their potroast sandwich has become my ultimate go to comfort food and their salmon BLT is just, so good.  Their food combined with $3.50 22 oz yuenglings all day every day makes this a great spot.",

The food is just not good...at least everything that I've tried. Even for bar food, Lot 17 struggles to put out a decent product. The zucchini strips were way too greasy. Yes, I've never met a non-greasy fried zucchini strip, but these are saturated and almost taste like they came out of a bag pre-breaded. Definitely lacking that hand-breaded aspect. The chicken nachos were made with seemingly-stale tortilla chips and were so bland that I actually left more than half of the plate uneaten. That's a rarity for me, a self-proclaimed nacho addict. I've also tried the cheese wedges and the chicken tenders. The cheese wedges are another product that seems so simple to pull off, yet they come out cold and greasy. The only app that we enjoy at al is the chicken tenders, but while they're decent, the rest of the food that we've tried was so blah that I haven't been able to bring myself to ordering an actual meal or sandwich from the menu. Hence, why you see only a review of apps.  Fortunately, just when all hope seems lost, they flip on my game and their solid beer list swoops in to save the day.  Service can be spotty, but it's been decent at the bar every time that we've gone. At some point I'll have to try a sandwich or meal, but it's really hard to fake an appetite after knowing what kind of product they're willing to serve for appetizers. Hopefully I'll be able to improve my review after trying more of the menu. Fingers crossed.",

Having said that, the BF and I have finally joined in on the brunch band wagon. Of course, I'm not a drinker, so it was really breakfast, but whatever. The BF had the eggs and bacon, which comes with potatoes and toast. It was a solid breakfast. I thought the eggs were cooked to perfection; not over done or rubbery at all. I think the bacon comes from DJ's butcher shop (which would make sense considering it's two stores down) but either way it was top notch stuff. Thick cut with very little fat.  I got the morning melt, which is an egg sandwich on grilled bread, kind of like a grilled cheese. It had eggs, bacon and lots of cheese. I wasn't really expecting it to be grilled but it was a fortuitous mistake, cause dam it was yummy. It comes on the same French bread as the toast and is a pretty big sandwich. I only ate half and let the BF have some and there was still some to take home! It also came with potatoes as well, so.... The other brunch options were a sunrise burger, that comes with an egg on top, salted caramel French toast and a couple other things. It was a small menu, like most Brunch menus, but it had some decent sounding options. I also saw lots of carafes of Mimosas and other fruity-looking morning cocktails, so they've got that covered as well. Overall I may not really understand the brunch phase, but I love all the new places serving breakfast options.",

Deciding not to go with a burger for the umpteenth time, I instead chose the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sandwich, which comes complete with a pineapple ring, a drape of provolone cheese, and roasted red peppers. It's shame that the exquisitely tender chicken didn't smack much of jerk seasoning, though. Nonetheless, sweet, savory, tart, and creamy cavorted brilliantly together within a Sunday dinner-worthy Kaiser roll on a Saturday night. A flawless pile of housemade, kettle-plunged, perfectly salted potato chips complimented the soft and juicy sandwich with their inherent crunch factor.   A domineering cleat of an after-dinner treat, the Snickers Ice Cream Pie had me bug-eyed upon its arrival, something my wonderful server (name forgotten) got a laugh out of.   Carvel had nothing on this monstrosity of vanilla and chocolate ice cream that was garnished with nuts, candy pieces, and sauces of the caramel, white chocolate, and dark chocolate varieties. An Oreo crust would hold this sundae-on-a-plate together, bringing more texture as well as stability to this luscious, saccharine, bon-bon-riddled masterpiece of frozen confection.   With quick, courteous, adept service and above average bar food, Lot 17 has hollowed out a deserved niche for itself in this restaurant-heavy area of Pittsburgh. Considering I have credit left on that card and that Hot Card participants are dwindling, I may be overdue for another visit, and it will be without a hint of reluctance, Lot 17 proving itself to be a sturdy dining option in a neighborhood with much...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5U9wGcQYfVw&s=38e29dfd1eb191dd847357c8e27bc5e0821f0bf1393d62f81a79ada2b62ddd5f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=5U9w...</a>",

    "text": "So so draft selection, service and food. The location is awesome, the decor is beautiful, but I wasn't impressed either time I came here. They don't have a happy hour menu, just a small discount on beers. The first time I stopped by was for drinks only and the second time, I decided to grab something to eat. I ordered the chicken fingers with the house special coconut. I assumed that the house special coconut was a dipping sauce, but it was actually how the chicken fingers were breaded. They were very good with bbq sauce. Several people at our table (party of 8) ordered the chicken fingers- all in different ways. I understand how as a server it may be confusing when that occurs, but coming from someone who served in a restaurant for many years, I think it's your job to know where the food goes. Write it down with their names and there would be a problem. Our server didn't do that, meaning food was going to the wrong people and it caused a lot of unnecessary confusion and disturbed our experience. I then ordered the sriracha chicken wrap and sweet potato fries to go and grabbed my boyfriend the jalapeno steak wrap. We both thought they were good, but definitely not something to write home about or even return for. Nothing was bad, but it wasn't amazing either. That just about sums up my entire experience here.",

Add far as aesthetics, I've always loved the old fashioned fan above the bar, and the bar itself. It truly is a \"Pittsburgh\" bar. They have made some really smart enhancements, though. One, the open window bar overlooking the street. Love it! They also have a retractable awning for the patio seating which is thoughtful and unique to the area.   We just had a drink, but I took a look at their new menu and it all sounds really tasty, and prices seem very fair. Nice style to the menu, also. As new bars come into the area, it's inevitable that a business might feel the need to change to keep up with their neighbors. Lot 17 had done just enough without ruining their already great vibe! As always, very nice service!",

I've driven past this place several times and always said I wanted to try it. I'm so glad we did.   The physical menu was slightly different from the one online, but only because they had JUST updated it. One of the items featured under the salad section was a Chicken Salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and french fries. I asked if they would make it a buffalo chicken salad and they were incredibly accommodating, even asking if I'd prefer the buffalo chicken to be fried or grilled. The salad was delicious!!!!   Mom ordered a burger that was not on the online menu. It was the buffalo burger. Not buffalo meat. Buffalo sauce! That's right, they flavor the burger patty with ranch powder and pour buffalo sauce on top and melt a nice slice of mozzarella cheese on top! PLUS the burger patty was bigger than the bun itself. She thoroughly enjoyed it.   Dad ordered a Ruben sandwich with sweet potato fries. He said it was really tasty! Not to mention the fact that this place serves a special homemade sweet butter with their sweet potato fries.   There were very few customers inside, which surprised me, since it was around 6:00pm. But because of that the service was exceptional. The chef even came out and was thrilled to see that we just about licked our plates clean!  We will definitely be coming back here!",

The service was super fast, but the server seemed less interested in helping us choose what app or wine to get and more into just getting our orders and darting off. I can't say that she wasn't attentive because I barely finished my wine before she asked me if I wanted another. I'll take that over bad service any day though!  We ordered a couple apps with our drinks and there were more misses than hits. The fries were skinny and bland. The calamari was probably the worst I've ever had, but the crab stuffed portobello's... Awesome! Weird right?   So honestly I wouldn't be opposed to stopping in again, I'd just be very very careful with what I order. Maybe thoroughly research the other reviews for the good stuff. I mean, hey... Isn't that what Yelp's for!?",

It's not uncommon for my wife and I to go here 3-4x a month and on multiple times we've brought friends and family along because we've consistently had good experiences here.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is consistently good. For a 9 dollars, I often get the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. My wife sometimes gets one of the other chicken wraps (which are also good) or gets a salad. They always have a special and the times that I was inclined to try it, I didn't leave disappointed either. Usually, on average, for two wraps and appetizer and a drink each, our bill is no more than 35 dollars. I think the best thing about Lot 17 is that it's family owned... the owners are always around and take an interest in ensuring their customers have a good experience.",

I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.  When we walked into the restaurant, it was totally dead aside from one other table of diners. I figured the place should be bustling since it was such a delightful day outside, but I soon came to realize why the place was a ghost town.  The simple lunch menu of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and wraps is nice and compact. I chose a turkey burger and regular fries, which arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were tasty... after I salted them. There was absolutely no salt of them when they came out. The turkey burger was seasoned well, but it was dry as a bone. I suspect the turkey patty was frozen, but the burger was so overcooked, I cannot say for sure.  Our server was attentive and friendly. The building is clean, polished, and has some nice HDTVs.   When I chose  to go to Lot 17, I figured I was trying it out for the first time. After we ate lunch, I realized I had gone there once in the past for lunch with other co-workers. What does this mean? Lot 17 is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination. Even with my below-average experience, I think the place has potential, but the execution was just not there on my visit. I hope they can step it up at lunch in the future.",

The potato itself was nice and crispy but too much dried cheese caked on top for my liking.   I opted for the black bean burger with a side of sweet potato fries for my entree. The sweet potato fries come with a cinnamon dip on the side which was delicious. The patty was one of the better veggie burgers I've had in comparison to other bar restaurants I've been to so I recommend it for my vegetarians out there. However, the salsa on top was a weird choice, and it didn't go well with the burger in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered the nachos as his meal which he would not recommend. The portion size was generous but the quality was mediocre.   The restaurant itself is smaller and got pretty loud for a random weekday evening. Make sure to bring your butt cushions because those wooden seats can get a tad uncomfortable if you sit there long enough.",

Another group was ordering beers (after we were told by our server she'd be right back to take our order) and she took their second beer order and retrieved the beers before even looking our way again. Should have only been here an hour, but were here for over an hour and a half.   I had the coconut chicken salad which was AWESOME. The chicken was so crispy with a subtle sweetness. Overpriced at $13 though. Come on, with a tip I spent $16 total..for a salad at a bar restaurant!   My friend had the blue cheese burger which she said was just OK. She ordered it medium and it came out well done which was disappointing. Props on the sweet potato fries though - they were excellent.",

Probably my favorite thing on the menu. It comes with 2 slices of pineapple on top of a perfectly cooked chicken breast rubbed in a amazing jerk seasoning. The sweet potato fries come with a sweet dipping sauce that is crazy good",

Small place, fast service.  TVs streaming annoying ads everywhere, the place is VERY LOUD, even on a slower night.  The staff was helpful, and the food was good.  We'd gotten the buffalo chicken sandwich (which my partner said needed MORE buffalo sauce) and the Rachel, which I felt was a little too salty.  The fries were good though, including every sauce they brought out.  DAT SUGAR BUTTER SAUCE for the sweet potato fires THOUGH.",

It's always an option on a Saturday afternoon when we're thinking of someplace to go to have an early dinner, late lunch or just grab a sammie and some beer. And it's a 30 minute drive for me! The service has always been good and we've never had an issue. We love the sandwiches and the wraps - my fave is the jalapeno steak wrap, although lately it seems that they've had too much wrap and not enough steak. But it IS real steak, not Steak-ums. That isn't always the case at other places.  But you can't go wrong - the Lot 17 salad is killer good. And the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the grilled pineapple is my wife's favorite. Not to mention the amazing sweet potato fries and the crack-like brown sugar butter dipping sauce. Always a good rotating selection of good beers and I'm always happy to choose among several I would drink anytime. In fact, I'm getting a strange craving for that steak wrap and some crack butter....",

It's a pretty small space with plenty of wood surrounding the bar up front and a small booth filled dining room in the back. We've eaten here well over a dozen times and have always enjoyed our experiences here.  The sandwiches are killer!!!! I enjoy a good chicken sandwich and their Jerk Chicken Sandwich with grilled pineapple, provolone and roasted red peppers may just be my favorite chicken sandwich ever! I've also had the crab cake sandwich which is pretty darned fantastic, too. The jalapeno steak wrap is so delicious and spicy that it also ranks near the top of delightful choices. It's real steak cooked to order inside, too. The fish tacos are also a tasty option.  I'm not much of a French fry eater unless I'm at Lot 17. Their sweet potato fries are served with a side of brown sugar honey butter dipping sauce that I wish I could make at home. Tried and failed many times. It's the perfect compliment and I now refuse to get sweet potato fries anywhere else because I'd just flat out miss that sauce too much! Occasionally it shows up runny or less than perfect & I get sad but its still better than my best attempt to copy it.  Beer selection is good but could be more extensive. We've sampled some of the items off the appetizer menu in our early days coming here and realized they were totally unnecessary based on the amount of food you receive off the sandwich menu. We did manage to score some free chicken wings by texting Lot 17 using a sign on our booth once. Fun!  Overall, love this bar. We've continually had good service, the food comes out quickly & the prices are reasonable.",

I opted for coconut chicken tenders, and let me tell you, they were HUGE, juicy, and crispy! Everything you want in a chicken tender!  The bar was full of folks watching multiple football games on different screens, and I got a good feeling about this being a neighborhood bar that is choc full of locals.

It was about half full on a Friday night at 11.   My boyfriend remarked as we bar crawled down Liberty Ave that \"its funny how the prices increase as we move toward Lawrenceville\". Prices were pretty much what I expected, a little over six dollars for each of our beers. After the tip I felt like my wallet was empty.

I could order them all in one outing even though they don't typically go together! Tacos are $2 on Tuesday and wings are $6 for 10 on Thursdays. That's two good reasons to come here every week.  Lastly, I appreciate that they don't limit themselves to serving drafts from PA (there's a lot more out there beyond Yuengling). For example, they are currently pouring the Sculpin IPA, much to the delight of my fiancee and some cool Magic Hat brews.",

We were happy with both of our selections. They both came w a side, and we got fries. The fries reminded me of McDonalds fries - which can be good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for.

That place for me is Lot17. Conveniently, located in Bloomfield if I choose to the Bigelow Bridge home. I usually can always find parking and somewhere to sit. The ceiling and design of the place have a historic local but relaxed and chill new place.  Dave (owner) and Patty (bartender) that is works usually during the week have always made every visit there great. Wings on Wednesday night is always a good call. Their food isn't anything that I would say, 'Yes, it's incredible you can not get it anywhere else\" but rather for your money everything i've ordered hit the spot and was good. They also have weekly food specials that you will want to ask about when ordering if you did not see the little chalkboard.  You also can not beat their beer special on tap. Whatever brewery they are featuring you can get a 23 oz  for the same price as a pint.  You can not go wrong if you looking for a place to just kick back before going home for the evening or post up and watch any game you would like on one of the screens.",

There wasn't a hostess nearby so we assumed that we sat ourself. It took a little to be greeted by the server but she had an obscene amount of tables to attend to- I'm assuming someone called off.   I ordered the Orange Crush cocktail and it was really tasty and really strong. Also ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer. They were definitely good but I think the salsa was jarred and not homemade - or it tasted like it.   I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with cajun fries and it didn't disappoint. I'm a little buffalo chicken obsessed and it had everything I was looking for. The chicken was tender and very lean, the buffalo sauce had to be homemade and tasted like it, and the ranch was my favorite. The Cajun fries were bomb and definitely have a nice kick to them.   My boyfriend got the steak fajita wrap and really enjoyed it!   We'll be back.",

My husband and I went here with our dog so we sat outside. the waitress was very nice and as timely as she could be with out busy it was.  The location, the vibe, and the staff are the reason for the 4 stars. however a star was lost from me (almost 2, but I decided to drop just one) because the food was honestly super mediocre for the price and atmosphere. I really was hoping for some great food, but it was simply okay.  If this place kicked up the food quality just a little (even if they maintained the same menu, just did a bit of a better job) then this would easily be a 5 star place.",

The bar/restaurant is set up with the bar in the front room and the dining tables in the back. From the street the place looked absolutely packed on a Friday night and I thought we'd never get seated. However, almost all the tables were empty (just couldn't tell that from the street).  It was pretty loud, whoever was choosing the music was so on point with the 90's and 2000's hip hop. Can't complain a bit.   The menu was somewhat simple... American cuisine= Burgers, Mac-n-Cheese, wraps, and the normal appetizer options for a bar. We all shared the Chicken Nachos and Stuffed Banana Peppers. The Chicken Nachos were pretty average, but the stuffed banana peppers were AWESOME (hot sausage was no joke). I also, had the Jalapeno & Honey Bourbon Mustard Burger. The burgers were BIG and overall the food was good.",

If you spend some time looking around, you'll be impressed by how intentional the interior is.   Drink prices are a bit high. You can mitigate it by ordering the brewery of the month or other specials that are always going on.   The staff is always friendly and accommodating.

The Rachel was quite nice, great flavors, the heat of the sandwich on the plate did make the bread a little wet on the underside but I'm not one to quibble and enjoyed it thoroughly, regardless.  The Sweet potato fries were nice enough but were extraordinary with the sugary dipping sauce that came with them.   Pricing was nice. The cocktail was only $6 and the sandwich $8.50.  What really sold me was the staff. We ducked into Lot 17 when we, tourists, got lost using the bus system. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly, getting us a number for a cab and estimating how much it would cost a couple college students to taxi into downtown.  Ordered some cheap, game night beer while waiting to be picked up. The bartender was gruff but that seems to be a theme of pittsburgh.  The overall atmosphere was loud and gregarious. Lots of cheering when the correct team scored and laughing and patting of backs. I would definitely return.",

When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.",

I had a glass of red wine but it wasn't very good, but they don't really cater to wine drinkers, so I didn't have high expectations.  This place is ok on occasion and great for casual drinks and bar food with friends especially if you are under 40, but now that I've crept past 40 it just really isn't my scene.  The food is tasty but nothing to write home about - I mean it kind of reminds me of TGI Friday's or Chili's along that line except in a less commercial environment.  The prices are great and there is nothing bad about it; it's just nothing that knocked my socks off and makes me want to go back again, especially when there are so many other options in Pittsburgh with good wines lists and better food.",

Beer prices are reasonable with a very wide selection of drafts and bottles, but are by no means the cheapest in the area. I haven't tried much of the food except for the wings, which are good and a safe bet if you don't know what to order.   Lot 17 is a PITT bar and a great place to watch a Saturday football game or a basketball game. I also believe that during the basketball season it is host to the Jamie Dixon radio show.

I also truly appreciate the ambiance at Lot 17 - it's like the old meets the new. They've incorporated clean, dark colors of their bar, seats, booths, tables to the old rustic look of the building. The service is friendly and attentive.

It was tasty.  This is better than your average bar.  The food is good, the beer selection is good.  It's not blowin-your-mind crazy awesome...it's just damned good bar food.",

    "text": "My favorite wings in Pittsburgh.  Right amount of tang and heat without just being a bottle of Franks.    Salads are all great (Lot 17 Salad and Grilled Steak Salad are my favs).  The sweet potato fries are also delicious.  Really, everything on the menu is great - I've never been disappointed.  This is better than just bar food.  A great casual spot!  Chicken sandwich, mini-burgers, nachos, all are great.  Now I'm starving and want to go for wings.  Additionally, they have an upstairs room available for private parties.  I held a birthday party here and they went well out of their way to make sure we got everything we needed.",

    "text": "Pretty impressive menu for a neighborhood bar! I couldn't decide what I wanted, but went with the veggie pita. I asked for no cheese and they were very accommodating. Not only were the pita, grilled veggies and pesto delicious, the presentation was nice too! They dusted some sort of seasoning around the edge of the plate, fancy-ing it up a bit! I really enjoyed what I ate, and the side salad I ordered was also a generous size. Laid back, friendly atmosphere and staff. It looks like a great spot for a work happy hour. I'll be back!",

    "text": "DON'T GET THE FISH!  Just had a fish sandwich at Lot 17 and it was 85% breading and 15% fish.  It looks impressive as hell coming out in two big pieces hanging over the bun.  Of course it was only 7.50 which isn't bad but I wouldn't recommend anyone to get it.  There are other items on the menu that are Lent friendly.   I have had other food at Lot which has been good so I felt the need to rate it 3 stars.  I will go back eventually but it won't be for a fish sandwich.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh is a town where \"bar food\" means the exact same menu in every last place you'd drink a beer, with the fryer in heavy rotation.  My girlfriend and I both had sandwiches, and they were among the best I ever recall eating.  I had a portabella mushroom sandwich, and at no point did I wish I'd just ordered a burger.    As far as bar food goes, this is the best I know.  Edit: Went back and was less impressed; dropping this from 5 to 4 stars.  Nothing particularly wrong, but not in the \"best thing ever\" category.  Still really solid.",
