The counter staff is great explaining how it works and the quality and flavor was perfect!  The place wasn't super noisy either so we could chat without shouting, which is often rare at casual dining places.  Definitely a great inexpensive eatery!",

Ok went on site new place from what I can see. The staff is very friendly and attentive going over combinations for pizza.  Bottom line great wood fire pizza and staff.   4 stars because of management's lacking a sense of urgency to fix online ordering app or offering a work around.",

You walk through the line choosing your sauce, cheese, toppings, or choose a signature pizza with the topics selected for you.  They then pop it in their open-flamed pizza oven and it's ready in a minute or so.  Has fountain drinks and several iced-teas, sort of like Panera.  Employees were walking around and picked up our tray for us once we were done.  Everyone was friendly.  Will 100% be back!",

Better than Dominos, et al., but if you want great pizza, find a real pizzeria, OTOH if you like flavorless junk like &pizza from DC this is a step up. It was ok for a a quick meal w/o sit down or the usual burgers or factory chicken. the crust is a little rubbery after it sits for a while. The toppings are ok but not first rate--gorgonzola livens up the boring mozzarella. Popular with families with little kids--eat outside or takeaway if you want to avoid a high decibel level.",

People had been recommending it, and I had taken my son to Sam's Club, but they were close to closing, and they just ran out of any pizza he would be interested in eating, so I figured we'd give the place a try because I knew it was going to be quick.  Well, boy was I wrong.  I think it's price pretty fairly.  I mean it's more expensive than Dominos, or Little Caesers, which aren't that great tasting, but a good value for the money, but probably on par with a good pizza shop.  Plus you get unlimited toppings.  Of course you'll want to not go overly crazy with the toppings, but it's nice not to get charged $1.50 a topping like a pizza place would.  The pizza was decent.  I'd probably rate the place a 4 out of 5 for pizza taste.  What sets it apart is that you can pick a bunch of toppings and not go bankrupt doing it, the pizza is ready in 3 minutes, which is great too.  What really sets this place apart are the drink options.  They have all sorts of unique drinks I've never seen anywhere else.  I only tried one as we did take out, which was blood orange lemonade, but it was very good.  I'm kind of looking forward to going back and eating in just so I can try another one or two of the drinks.  If you have also been a little skeptical, definitely give this place a try as I don't think you'll be let down.",

It was well staffed and everyone was attentive and helpful, spending extra time with us to go over how the menu works. I created my own pizza with pesto sauce and veggies. You walk down the line and say which toppings you want (they also have specialty pizzas on the menu you can choose from if you don't want to create your own). Once you pick everything, they put it in the oven, you pay, and sit down. Then they call you once it's ready.   The quality of the pizza was good. The manager even came over to see how are food was, and again to clear the table once we were done. My only complaint is I wish the pizza was a bit warmer. It got cold pretty quickly. But it was still delicious nonetheless! And the price was great - about $10 for the entire pizza and a fountain drink. I will definitely return if I'm in the area.",

The pizzas were beautiful and everyone was extremely pleasant. The place was packed when we arrived around 8. I got a white pizza with veggies and tried the gluten free crust, and my husband got some sausage with a red sauce and traditional crust. They even asked if I wanted them to change their gloves with the gluten free pie. So considerate, and I've never been asked this before, although my gluten free crust was a preference and not due to allergy.  Several of the male workers fist-bumped my husband and started convo with us about it being our first time here. The manager checked in at our table and asked how we enjoyed our food, making the experience more personable. I LOVED the minced and roasted garlic toppings available. I only wish the minced would be fresh, because you can tell it's from a jar. There are also red peppers, oregano, and cheese containers you can take to your table, if you'd like. They had --easily --a dozen people working there. And I think that's what kept the line rolling along so quickly.  My only gripe would be that one of the waitresses was causing a scene because she had to stay until 830. Her mom was in line and the girl was pretty vocal about wanting to leave, which was disruptive. She was even rude to her co workers and I want to give them a shout out for handling this in a professional manner. I am still keeping 5 stars because they didn't let her interfere with their work.

They also have an order online feature-I can see this being very convenient for families, offices, or if you're just on the go! It's a little more expensive than your average pizza place, I paid $10.59 for a pie and a drink, but keep in mind you're probably getting more than you would if you got two slices-I took 1/3 home with me. It's pretty tasty pizza (coming from a New Yorker) and I will be back.   P.S. Blaze, please never get rid of the iced tea and lemonade, I enjoyed a nice Arnold Palmer with my lunch!",

    "text": "I had heard about this chain, being backed by Lebron, and was curious to see what the hype was about. It has proven to be legit. Been here several times now, and apart from some minor gripes, am overall impressed and will continue to frequent this place. It's a great concept. Fresh oven baked pizza, with 40+ toppings, with different options of crust, cheese and sauce?!! I'm in!! And oh, it's the same price if you get 2 toppings or if you get 40+ toppings. For real??! yes! One time I ordered there and waited, the other times I've ordered online. Both are good systems, however, if you order/purchase online, you can save time by bypassing the line in the store. You just walk up to the cashier to let them know you're there for pick-up. You will still have to wait, but that's because they will bake it then and there for you, which is fine by me. Even if you go and order there, their system of assembling your pizza is pretty efficient and seems to work well. That line can be out the door sometimes though. There's a large dining area, inside and out, if you want to enjoy your piping hot and fresh pizza there. Good for groups. They have salads and dessert too. Minor gripes would be that I've had my ingredients messed up, some missing, some I didn't order. But, in the end, it didn't taste bad so I was okay with it. The crust is flavorful, not dry or bland, as it's made with EVOO. They've got gluten free crust, vegan cheese, veggies like zucchini, artichokes, spinach which you don't see much around. They have finishings too like EVOO, balsamic drizzle, pesto drizzle, arugula, etc.  Yep, i'm a fan.",

I can safely say we've totally taken into the build-your-own pizza thing with unlimited toppings. It's still a total bargain at $8, but more importantly it's delicious. Our creations are nowhere close to a traditional pizza. To be clear, I appreciate white or margherita pizzas as much as the next person, but more often than not I crave something more substantial. It turns out that putting all my favorite vegetables and meats in a live-fire oven on top of a piece of dough can make for a very enjoyable meal. And there's definitely room to be creative with different combinations of sauces, cheeses, and spices as well.  Another neat feature is their offering of drinks. They have, in addition to fountain sodas, two types of agua fresca and two types of lemonade. They are all refreshing and worth trying, but we especially liked the agua frescas. One is a cactus pear; the other is key lime mint. Both taste very real without being overly sweet. They are great alternatives to the usual sodas for pairing with your meal.",

Can't believe unlimited toppings are all up for grabs at one price! For $8, you may fill up your own personal pizza anyway you like it! I wish the signature pizzas were somewhere like $6 because it only includes 3-4 max toppings. I went a bit overboard and might have gotten around 10+ toppings and my only complaint is that they didn't leave it in the oven for long enough. My mushrooms, peppers and onions were barely warm. Yes, it would've helped if I didn't pile literally everything on my pizza but supreme is my usual to-go so this place made it so easy to go crazy with the toppings!  Also, please note that the spicy red sauce is legit pretty spicy. I needed to blow my nose afterwards.  Service - so nice! The employees at this location were super! Everyone in line said my name multiple times and answered my questions promptly. The cashier lady even grabbed my salad for me since it was at the beginning of the line. She later checked in on us to see how we liked everything. Very attentive!  Drinks - so good! The agua fresca choices (prickly pear and sweet mint lime) and lemonade (regular and blood orange) were unique, refreshing and da bomb!  How I wish this could replace any of those fast food burger places on Golden Mile Highway--goodbye Burger King or Wendys! The quantity is filling fo sho. I only managed to wolf down half my personal pizza so saved the rest for tomorrow's lunch. Good deal! I want to come back next time just to try the desserts!",

This was our first time here and it was hard to decide what to order with so many options. Decisions...decisions.... I finally chose a white pizza with sausage, peppers, veggies, roasted garlic, both goat and mozzerella cheeses and topped it off with some balsamic glaze. It was fabulous! The hubby ordered the spicy red sauce with all the meats, peppers and several cheeses. It was also very good for those who like some heat.  I also sampled the aqua fresca which was a nice change from typical sodas. I got the prickly pear and it was delicious and refreshing. I would absolutely order it again.

I left miserable because I should have stopped eating, but it was good, I kept on.  Blaze is like the Subway of pizza. All the toppings are before you and you tell the people which ones you want and watch as they make your pizza. Not enough cheese for you? No problem, just tell them to add more! And there's a ton of different cheeses to choose from, too....not just mozzarella.  Then the toppings. I've never seen so many (and I worked in a pizza place when I was younger!). And it's not like traditional pizza places where you pay by the topping. A one-topping is cheaper, but if you're getting two or twenty, it's all the same price.  Then when you get to the end of the line, you pay and patiently wait for your pizza. But you don't wait long because their fire ovens cook the pizzas in about 3 minutes. Yes, only three minutes and they're cooked, not icky and doughy.   The pizzas are a medium size and cost $8.25 (before tax). You can get a box for it if you want it to go or just can't eat all of it. We couldn't, so took the rest home. When my son came home from work, he heated the leftover pizza up in the microwave and even with being reheated (which, to me, is gross) he said it was the best pizza he'd had, too.  Can't recommend this place enough! I'll definitely be going back!",

Onions, mushrooms, spinach and grilled onion.    All super fresh.   My husband had ham, salami, pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and peppers.    They say 180 seconds...but if you pile on the toppings it takes a few extra minutes. Well worth the wait!   Crisp thin crust, tangy fresh tomato sauce and deliciousness toppings!

However, we ended up adding a bunch of toppings of our choice and guess what...there was no extra charge for the toppings. they use a mechanical press kind of thing to press the dough into a pizza which was interesting to watch. And since the crust is so thing, cooking time is also fast with no compromise in the taste and quality.   I also tried cream soda. I am not sure if I like it or not. It is a new flavor for me and I might try again. The place is neat and the staff was helpful when I had questions about placing the order.

It fills the void between the local pizza joint/artisanal places and the \"normal\" chain store pizza restaurants.

I just took my daughter to Blaze the other day for our umpteenth visit since it opened and I was still amazed that I ordered a pizza with grilled chicken, pepperoni, salame, cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic, mushrooms, sauteed onions, spinach, zucchini, ovalini mozzarella, parmesan, mozzarella, white cream sauce and garlic pesto sauce.  I am not particularly a fan of extremely thin crust so I opted for their slightly thicker crust and my bill came to less than $11.  Fo real doh!  That pizza would have been a gazillion dollars at another pizza joint and it wouldn't have tasted as fresh.  When you have a high turnover of ingredients, you have a greater chance of having better quality and freshness.  Blaze Pizza has that in spades.  Me likey this restaurant and I think that you will too!  Great bang for the buck!",

No more compromising on a topping simply because your wife or brother or whomever wants something different. You want it? You GET it. And it was GOOD!   Service was fast and the staff was pleasant and accommodating. Unfortunately for us, we moved out of the area before Blaze opened or we would have been regulars here.",

The ingredients are fresh and in plain sight for you to see, just what your ordering. The choices are all to suit any pizza lover. I love the lemonade drink choices, blood orange was my choice. The Agua Fresca choices are delicious as well. They change the choices fragrantly.  There is something for everyone.  The service is quickly and friendly and helpful to first time customers. Take out boxes are available if you find it hard to finish the whole pizza. I Highly Recommend and a Must Try to all Pizza Lovers. I will keep this on the restaurant rotation list !  My choice for fast food.  I can't comment on the desserts, but I will try the next visit.",

The prices are fine but it can get pretty busy. My only suggestion would be some alternate protein choice for vegetarians. There was nothing for me on a Friday during lent. Maybe chickpeas or shrimp?",

They then out it into a brick oven and you can watch it cook. It taste very good it's a thin pizza with a small round thin crust. I wouldn't get too many toppings though, your pizza will be a little too wet on top, but still good. Also, it takes about 10 minuets from when you get in to when you can have your pizza.l, and it is very inexpensive. I really like this place and I have become a big fan of Blaze Pizza. I highly recommend it. Enjoy :)",

During our most recent visit to the area, we went to try it out for lunch one day, and it's pretty good!  For the most part, it's very similar to Mod Pizza in that you get to add as many ingredients to your custom pizza as you want for a reasonable price. Pricing works differently from Mod, and you end up paying a little bit more for a medium-sized pizza with unlimited toppings.  We went with a custom pizza and a small order of dough knots. The pizza was good, and there was a distinction from Mod in that the crust underneath stays nice and crispy even with wet pizza ingredients. The knots were fine, but nothing outstanding.  Overall a good experience, and I'd go back for the pizza!",

So, crudely-stated, Blaze is \"Subway for pizza\" but with fantastic service  and truly excellent ingredients.  Basically you order a custom one-size-fits-all, DIY pizza with phenomenal bread and some really tasty sauce, they throw it into the fire for a few minutes and POOF! good pizza you're glad to pay $10 for.  Hug it up with a mix-it-yourself fountain drink or some punch (Blood orange lemonade!!) and it's a great meal.  No muss, no fuss, quick, easy gourmet-grade custom pizza in MINUTES!  ...and it's goood!  It's really rare that a pizza shop nails the dismount for the crust, but hi-rise option is worth the $2 upcharge.  ...I took that first bite of mine and had to focus in on my slice real good with knitted brows, like: \"Damn!\"   Om nom nom!!",

Then you can choose your sauce, cheese, meats, and veggies. They then ask if you'd like to finish off your Pizza with oregano or fresh sea salt. They then put your pizza into a fire oven and let it cook for 3 minutes! Lastly, there are \"finisher\" sauces you can have drizzled on top of your pizza.   Blaze also has agua Fresca, which is a total win for me! Previously, i was only able to find agua Fresca at a couple of other places around Pittsburgh, so i was super excited about that! I chose a Passionfruit agua Fresca and it was so good!!   I would definitely recommend Blaze if you like your Pizza a certain way. You are the creative genius of your very own pizza! It's like a Chipotle for Pizza!   Not to mention, the inside of the restaurant is cozy and comfortable. And they have takeout boxes by the fountain drinks so you can enjoy your leftovers later on!",

    "text": "Great pizza, fast!  Blaze is the Subway of Pizza. Blaze is perfect for the family with picky eaters or just when everyone wants different things on their pizza. You walk up to the counter and have a choice of 9 different signature pizzas with various sauces and topping or you can build your own which is what we usually do.   The pizzas are 6 cut and run between $7 and $8 depending on which of the two crusts you choose. I always choose the high rise dough crust which is $1.00 more as it is thicker than their original crust which is paper thin.   After you choose your crust you have your choice of pizza sauce with include red sauce, spicy red sauce,  white cream sauce and garlic pesto sauce.  Next you pick your choice of cheese which include goat, gorgonzola, mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta and vegan cheese.  Then you pick your meats. Your choices are Applewood bacon, crumbled meatballs, grilled chicken, Italian sausage, pepperoni, salami and smoked ham. You can add as many of any topping you want at no extra charge!  Finally you choose your veggies. You can choose from artichokes, arugula, banana peppers,  basil, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, chopped garlic, jalapenos, mushrooms, olives, red onions, red peppers, roasted garlic, sauteed onions, spinach and zucchini.  After you have finished your masterpiece it then goes in the pizza oven and in about two minutes later your pizza is fully cooked and ready to eat. I usually give my pizza 5 minutes to cool down a little as it comes out piping hot.   Make sure you try the blood orange lemonade. They even offer salads and S'more pies, sea salt cookies and olive oil brownies for dessert.  Every time we have gone the pizza was delicious and the staff was always happy and pleasant but, if you don't want to wait you can order online via their website and be sure to download the Blaze Pizza app so you can score some free food!",

I had my tastebuds set for my usual -- 2 build your owns at 8.45 each... but wait! With YELP checkin, it is 2 for one and has been that way since they opened here in Monroeville. That is an incredible deal especially to still be in play. Ummm.. my standard order is original dough with spicy red sauce and shaved mozzarella. Then I USED to order 2 Turkey meatballs for my protein, but, alas, they no longer have that as an option. Ok, a little more than disappointed but I will live. I opted for Italian meatballs. Then it is a splattering of mushrooms, roasted garlic, fresh basil, tomatoes. Finally, a hand spritzing of oregano and sea salt. Ahhh.  But wait! A brownie warmed by the oven. Oh, yeah. And finally, a fountain drink with a cup lid that makes their strawless environment doable.  Total? Under 14 bucks and I have a pizza to take home and a pizza to eat here. That, my Yelpers, is a grand deal AND awesome service and taste.",

However, the bar itself can become absolutely disgustingly dirty. They do not clean it off and the toppings, cheeses and meats fly all over the place. There were cheese crumbles in the sauce and the toppings were everywhere. I nearly turned around and walked out but instead I asked if there was a way I could get some fresh sauce and the pizza maker said yes and got some from the fridge. The vegan cheese had a lid on it. If these two things didn't happen I would have turned around and gave this place 1 star. It's pretty unacceptable and they need to change it.  That being said, the pizza is good. It's a nice place inside. Everyone is friendly enough. The amount of food is actually perfect because the crust is a bit thin (they offer a thick crust to by request) but they need to fix the cleanliness issue.",

They offered to used other types the like the ball cheese and started putting the ovaline cheese on it then finally came out. Put that on it and then tried to charge me for the extra topping. I'm sorry what... you said will this work I agree then try to charge me? I say no so you pick off the ball cheese. Come on. Haven't been back since. Congrats Lebron on another great endeavor",

The ordering was pretty fun for my daughter , as she enjoyed choosing what she wanted and watching them create the pizza . The workers seemed pretty nice and knowledgeable about the process which made for an easy and smooth order.  My husband asked for no onions in his meat lovers pizza but ended up still get onions . That being said , it happens and it was totally fine . Plain pizza , meat lovers pizza and a veg pizza with 3 beverages was about 30 bucks . Not bad at all. Atmosphere was pretty chill and the pizza ended up being delicious .   Obviously if you're looking for a fully loaded , thick crust top notch pizza - you'd be silly to come here and demand that kind of product. That being said , it was great food to throw down during an errand filled day and I would certainly come back here again . Yummy selection on the foundation drinks too! Unique flavors were fun to try .",

I highly recommend downloading the app so you can order online and pick up without the wait! The order is waiting for you on a shelf near the entrance.  Plus, there are promotions that you can get such as bogos and news updates. It gets really busy on Fridays and the restaurant is generally clean and noise levels are reasonable. It's a great concept and will do well, especially with the new high-rise dough!",

I think the young woman who took our order was either stressed or just didn't care to make sure it was correct. She marked meat lovers instead of bbq. She also did not get our (simple, common, 5 letter) last name correct so they called out a different name, which was confusing. The building is also made so that the sound is not absorbed. It is hard to hear in there. Another negative is the chairs. They were hard and the backs are not comfortable. I recommend sitting at a booth if possible. There were definitely things I would fix here, if possible, but the three most important parts of a restaurant were positive: we got our food quickly, it was delicious, and it was very affordable.",

The manager is really working hard to establish a rapport with the customers. We were asked if this is our first time at Blaze and each member of the line greeted us by name as we went through. The toppings are fresh and plentiful, and there's a great deal of variety. The employees are mostly young students which is great for the community.   Will definitely be back...great option for the price!",

Think of it as the pizza version of subway, but with better toppings. Service is fast and I got just what I wanted on my pizza. Place was actually pretty dope! If your near I would say give it a try. I also had a goat cheese and beet salad.... not usually something I would eat...... but it was delicious!!!!  Blaze: One for the dude in the background, doing the running man with his pants down!

I got the link and embellished to make my own creation. They seem to have fresh toppings with some you would want but not expect like roasted garlic, chopped garlic, sea salt, chopped zucchini and so many others with many kinds of vegetables and meats. Staff is friendly and up beat. All around this place is fantastic for a quick bite that doesn't break the bank and is actually very tasty. . After all you designed it. The reason  it wasn't 5 stars is because it was burnt.  Definitely will be back, I hope they maintain the same quality and staff friendliness. I believe the temperature is set too high since staff was watching  the oven the whole time. Or perhaps just getting a real fire oven instead of a pretend one.",

    "text": "Excellent experience on one of their opening days. Every team member that I interacted with was pleasant and seemed excited to be working at Blaze. The line was long but moved quickly. As we got inside we were surprised with how spacious it was. Plenty of seating at high top and regular tables. Coke products?? YES. Also, their iced tea was strong and not weak. The beverage choices and quality is so often overlooked here in Pittsburgh. Pepsi? No thanks!!!  Ok, and so you are probably wondering about the reason to come here ... the pizza.  I was really impressed with it - I tried the Green Stripe, which was a chicken and mozzarella pizza with a pesto drizzle. I thought my crust was cooked perfectly, which meant that the bottom was browned and some patches of char in places. I didn't try any of the salads or the S'mores Pie dessert but they all looked good too.  Finally, in terms of value I think that Blaze hits a home run. Two people could easily split one pizza without leftovers and pair it with a salad and you would have a great meal at an affordable price.   So a balanced review is nothing without some helpful criticism, right? I am struggling to come up with anything so I'll say that I wouldn't have minded more pesto on my pizza but I bet I could ask for some the next time. Also, I tried a \"high rise\" which doubles the amount of dough. This was perfectly fine and tasty but I think I would have enjoyed my pizza even more if I had stuck with the traditional (thinner) crust. For anyone with sensitivities they offer gluten-free crusts as well for an additional fee.   I am looking forward to a return visit - there is plenty of parking, which is great!",

I load up my pizza with all of the vegetables it can handle, roasted garlic, and top it off with spinach after it comes out of the oven.  Yes, it's a bit soggy toward the middle of the pizza but if they left it in the oven much longer the crust would just burn.    The place seems like it's managed well and there's always enough staff on hand to make the line go pretty quick.  The staff is always helpful in making suggestions and taking the time to make sure that you know what/how to order.    I've downloaded the Blaze app and can say that I'm not too pleased about its operation.  I'm missing flames that should've been added and have not received a response from corporate when I emailed them regarding this issue.  I also don't like that you can't add a gift card to the payment options within the app.  On the flip side, Blaze does add promotions to your app fairly often.  For about eight bucks you can get your customized pizza which may or may not be leftover for lunch the next day.",

I was able to order and sit down with my pizza and drink (pizza made in front of me in line mind you) in less than ten minutes.   If you have access to Blaze Pizza give them a try. You will not be disappointed!",

The timeframe from ordering to getting your pizza is quick, I haven't had to wait long on any of my visits. The cost is very affordable, I've always paid less than $10!",

She even gave me the full allergen menu so that one day we may try something other than just a simple pie. Another great experience at Blaze! Everyone was friendly and patient with the extra steps required to prevent cross contamination. We will definitely be back!",

Works well since my wife is a vegetarian and they have a really neat variety of veggie toppings as well. The service is fast and very attentive. I tasted on of their salads as well and didn't fancy it much but it was probably my fault trying a salad in an awesome pizza place.",

It's a build your own and choose an option from the menus. All pies are under $8. The lemonade (various options) is a great alternative to the soda fountain machine. They also have milk and water. I'm falling in love with this place! Pizza is Great!",
