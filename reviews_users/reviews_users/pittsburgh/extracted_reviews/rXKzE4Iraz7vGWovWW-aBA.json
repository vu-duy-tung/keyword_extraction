Our whole party felt rushed. Huge turn off constantly asking if she could take our check when all we wanted to do was enjoy the conersation with our group. Won't be back with that kind of service.",

Been waiting for PIttsburgh to replicate the ippudo kuro-obi quick service bars in NYC I ordered take out twice this weekend and both times it was complete perfection. Ive tried both chicken ramens and love the shoyu tare preparation the best. My husband loves the rayu. The leftovers heat up so well and this is def my favorite place in Pittsburgh right now for this type of food.",

I think the reason is the location but if this ramen bar was anywhere else in Pittsburgh aka lawrenceville, this would be the go to spot. Either way I will keep going there bc of the quality of food!!!",

It was perfect-tasty and whetted our appetites for the rest of the meal.  I had the rabata and the gyoza. The rabata was cooked perfectly, both the meat and vegetables. My husband and son had ramen and really enjoyed it. My husband added a spicy sauce and said it was just right. The service was very good. Nice atmosphere, too. They have happy hour, with half priced appetizers and other good deals, every day, including Saturday. They are closed on Sunday. Next time we are in Pittsburgh, we'll come back.",

If you walk to the restaurant it is pretty easy to find but in terms of parking im not quite sure what kind of parking is available. the staff is friendly and pretty attentive. we went with a big group but they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly. I got the yuzu ramen and I was super excited because I am a huge fan of yuzu. The ramen was a pretty decent size and the chachu was pretty good. Its not the authentic ramen I had envisioned but it was still pretty good so i would give the ramen a 4/5!",

That's key. Great when people understand that we only have a certain about of time to dine.   We had the steam buns for an app, they were good. Bun itself was very good along with the aioli, chicken was decent.   I had the Rayu Paitan and my coworker had the Miso Paitan. I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was anything I will crave. I've had other ramen and while I did appreciate the attention to detail at Yuzu, the flavor was missing something. My coworker said his Miso was overly salty and he usually loves Miso.   I'd go back, but probably not until I'm really really looking for Ramen on my lunch break again.",

Yuzu is off the beaten path so I hope it doesn't become forgotten, as the ramen is pretty good and perfect for a cold day in Pittsburgh. When my husband and I stopped in for lunch, surprisingly there was no one in the restaurant. It made us nervous at first but my rayu paitan ramen and his tang tang mien noodles proved to us that Yuzu was a gem.

Also for a single table of individuals they seem to not be able to bring up separate bills anymore to which I have no idea why. So everybody must throw in a credit card and split everything down the middle. This seems like a giant inconvenience to the customer in my opinion. Example : if you have three couples and you want only to pay for you and your significant other, you would not be able to do that at this restaurant. you all would have to throw in a credit card payment and then everyone's bill total would be split three ways essentially paying for the portion of the  other two couples meals if you only ordered something of minimal amount. They did better in the past , not sure why they changed.",

I ordered a spicy chicken bao bun and Cognac drink during happy hour. The buns were smaller and didn't have much meat but flavorful and the drink was strong. Each was only $5 so can't complain there. I ordered the chicken katsu curry (which isn't listed on the online menu). The chicken was hot and crispy but the flavor of the curry sauce was lacking. Most curry sauces, you can pick the spice level but you weren't able to here. The portion was large but dinner prices average from $13-15 and more if you want extras. Total was $25 not including tax/tip",

    "text": "Overall Impression: A unique Japanese spot for lunch that has amazing ramen, a great happy hour menu, and a calm ambiance.  The Food: I've eaten at this location on Wood Street twice so far, and it's nice to have a restaurant that serves authentic ramen, as it's hard to come by west of Downtown Pittsburgh. In my most recent visit, my group of 3 ordered the Salt and Pepper Tofu and Edamame as an appetizer. The S&P Tofu exceeded my expectations and was fried to a perfect consistency with a pleasantly creamy inside. The Edamame was good, but not my cup of tea. The others in my group seemed to enjoy it more than I did.  For my meal, I ordered the Rayu (Chili Oil) Paitan (White Broth) Ramen and Chicken Yellow Curry (for leftovers). The curry dishes don't have a scale for their spice level--they only come as is, so if you don't enjoy heavy spice I'd order something different. The chicken was moist and the yellow curry sauce had a depth of both spice and sweetness. The ramen became the shining star of my evening--pork belly cooked perfectly, broth with a pleasant kick, noodles firm. I had eggs, shitake mushrooms, and corn also mixed in, all wonderful additions.  The Restaurant: Dimly lit with a direct view of the half-open kitchen, my table always had a carafe of water (how fancy) and chopsticks for everyone to eat with. The waitress was a college student who was both pleasant and knowledgeable about their menu items. She immediately directed us to their happy hour cocktails and appetizers, and we all got at least one drink. The prices for HH were very reasonable! Everything is very clean and well decorated to fit the Japanese style--I especially like their tableware. The greeter was also smiling, wishing us a good night as we left.  TL;DR Yuzu is my go-to for Ramen in the Downtown Pittsburgh area that provides a well-worth it happy hour and Japanese-style experience. Even if you don't like tofu, just try it, it might change your mind on tofu forever!",

We were all first timers and our waitress took the time to walk us through the menu and recommend their top items. The menu is very vast, with traditional appetizers, entree salads, soup ramen, ramen stir fries, stir fries with various noodles or rice, etc. All with your choice of meat, tofu, or veggies. I ordered the ramen stir-fry and to make it vegan asked for steamed tofu and no fish sauce. Our waitress wasn't sure if they could accommodate, but she checked with the kitchen and came right back. Unfortunately their ramen noodles have egg in them, but she happily advised what my other options were and ultimately I ordered the Singapore Curry Noodles which were very thin rice noodles, yellow curry, bell peppers, red onion, scallions, with steamed tofu. So very delicious! So flavorful, loaded with veggies and tofu, served piping hot, not oily or greasy at all. Staff was super kind and food was great, I will definitely be back.",

The edamame was cooked PERFECTLY. Our waitress was patient, charming, and silly, which I found very pleasing. I can't believe how much food we got for the price we paid.

We arrived 20 min early hoping to grab drinks at the downstairs bar but never was waited on.  Appetizers were not served until 645.  The edamame was good as was the ginger sauce.  But the protein specifically the chicken for the lettuce wraps, curry in a stick, and \"nuggets\" was of low quality.  Extremely tough and chewy - just couldn't eat more than a few bites.  Ordered the peanut noodles.  It was extremely spicy and the server never refilled our water or drinks.  It only had three pieces of shrimp and the noddles were chopped up so small I wouldn't have guessed they were noodles had I not known what I ordered.  Also our orders came out one or two  at a time.  It was extremely awkward to have any kind of business etiquette in play with the individual delivery of our food once every five minutes one or two people at a time.  Either it all would have been cold if we waited until everyone was served.  Overall, it was just a very slow and understaffed experience.    The place is in a great location and the room upstairs was designed really well.  It's just a shame given the size of our party that we didn't have enough planned staff to support a better experience.    We ordered pitchers of their \"specialty\" drinks - one tasted like I sprayed my grandma's Perfume in my mouth.   The second was a burbon with cinnamon.  It was at least drinkable.  But I wouldn't order a mixed drink there again.  It was all just off.    Also no one asked how our food was, if we wanted anything else.  I thought that was Standard operating procedure for restaurants.    All in all there are way better options in downtown - if you want great food if the same style - highly recommend Nikki's it leaps and bounds beyond Yuzu.",

All 3 times having ordered the same dish (Da Shoyu Mein, if you're curious), I have nothing but good things to say and experience here. I've dined-in once and phoned-in orders the other two times. I like that the cuisine is a little different than other area Asian fare restaurants and it has been consistent every time....delicious, really.   It's tucked on Wood Street, while it doesn't get the same foot traffic as Market Square over lunchtime, it is worth the extra block and a half walk. Each time I've gone it's been busier than the last, I hope they continue to do well.  I have heard there is a second floor with a lunch buffet but I do not have details on that yet--will report back.",

    "text": "I came here before going to the Opera and I did not know what to expect. My friend who works down the street suggested it and I didn't have any other suggestion so we ended up here. I will say that it was A-OK. I would have to try more of their food other than the appetizers to truly get a good feel for it but all that we did was to eat some appys and to drink some drinks.   The good thing about this place is that its happy hour specials are pretty great. The drink specials are $5 for some pretty good cocktails and half off appys. I will say that the drinks were strong and they were really good. I would never pay full price for them tho, the size of them alone would make me say, nah...too small for the original price.   We sat at the bar and just ordered our food and our drinks from there. The service was interesting to say the least. Halfway through our time there the server at the bar switched over. The first server was really nice and talked to us about the champagne orders that were coming in and even let us try a sip of a bottle that was opened. I thought that was nice and would even go so far as to say I will be ordering that if I come back. That is the type of service that I really appreciate. He was prompt with our drinks, offered great suggestions and was very friendly. The second server that came on was prompt, was nice, and was friendly. But when asked for suggestions or just to chit chat he wasn't having much of it. He was super nice, but it was just a little different. It was getting busier by that time so he could have been distracted, but a little chit chat would have been nice. But I guess you never know as a server what is too much and what might be enough.   Drinks:  Brown Derby: Bourbon/Honey/Grapefruit. This was really good. It came in a short squat glass filled with ice. I liked that the bourbon taste was diluted a bit with the honey and the citrus. It felt to me that it just didn't bite as much as usual. I would get this again. It was a bit stronger so I would say that I could only drink one of these and had to move to another.   Honeysuckle: Rum/ Honey/Lime. Hmm do I see a pattern here? I just realized that I went with another drink with honey and citrus and just switched up the liquor. I guess I know what I like! This one was very good. It wasn't overly strong and was smooth going down. Rum is and easier drink to consume because it is basically a fruit. Or at least that is what I consider it. I would get this one again.   Moscow Mule: Vodka/ Ginger Beer/ Lime. I just tasted this because my friend got it and after two drinks myself, I was done. It tasted like a moscow mule. Nothing fancy, just crisp and refreshing. I don't know if I would pick this as my go to drink, but it was good, a bar staple.   Take Things Slowly: Gin/Lavender/Lemon. Again my friend picked this drink and I just had a few sips. I liked it a lot. I am not the biggest lavender fan but it had a really nice taste to it. Refreshing and cool. I do not know if I would get it because again, the lavender taste could get to me after a bit. But a few sips was nice, and if you can handle lavender this is the drink for you.   The drinks were really good and I would say for $5, that is a good way to spend an hour or two hanging out with friends and sipping some cool ones.   Now on to the appys!!  Appetizers: Seasonal Vegetable Tempura soy-dashi vinaigrette /ask server for daily veggies. This is the part where the second server made me laugh and shake my head. We asked what the daily veggies were and he was like..\"they are good, just get them, I don't know what they are, maybe sweet potatoes, carrots, and beans.\" It was really good. The soy dashi vinaigrette was phenomenal. The veggies were sweet potatoes, green beans, carrots, zucchini, and mushroom.  I really liked picking at this bowl. The tempura was thin enough that the breading wasn't over kill and then was still crispy enough to make an impression. The veggies were fried to perfection, not overly soggy and had a nice crunch to them still. But the star was that dipping sauce!!  Gyoza (6): pork / cabbage / dumplings / onions / scallions soy-ginger vinaigrette. Ok, confession, we ordered two of these. Yes, we ate 12 dumplings. They were good. The normal gyoza fair. They tasted just as I expected and not anything more or less. The sauce was really good too. I liked the veggie one better but still. This was a nice snack, so nice, we ordered that second dish. I liked that they were made perfectly with a little bit of the pan frying and the steamed. It makes me want to go out and get a bag and have a little gyoza night.   Chicken Bao (2)pulled chicken / japanese aioli / bib lettuce  steamed bun. I would pass on these if I had the choice. I picked these, and actually it was my choice, because I have been eating a lot of pulled pork and wanted to do something different than the pork baos. These were a bit dry for my taste. I dipped them in the vinaigrette!!",

I'm very excited for this place, and, talking to the front of house manager and others, it sounds like they've got a lot of great plans, such as expanding their already fantastic small plates selection.   The renovation of the space, previously a bank, is very tasteful; we saw other diners asking their server to take a photo of them against the decor before they left.  Their small plates, by the way.. try the Spicy Karaage and Cha-Shu Bao.. At least the buns, but I really couldn't pick one over the other.  The dinner crowd seems light right now (from when my wife and I went for dinner), and, from what I gather, it's a superb lunch spot, but the place has every makings of a dinner spot hit as well. I'm hoping it is one, because I love the place and want to continue going back. Try it!",

    "text": "Yuzu kitchen started the evening as my second choice, but when my first choice closed for business a half hour before we arrived...Yuzu was the happy ending I DESERVED.    There was not one negative.  I don't know that the food was so good I'd categorize it as five star ordinarily...but...it WAS good.  Really good.  And because it was well-prepared, graciously and quickly served, inexpensive, and delicious...man, I'm hard-pressed to argue myself into a four star review.  The cocktail menu is a high point.  There are some delicious drinks on there.  We made it about four deep in our sampling before cutting our losses, and three out of four were worth returning for in and of themselves.    The food was flavorful comfort food with nice portion sizes.  We ordered a robata sampler appetizer (marinated grilled meats and vegetables on skewers) that was delicious and more than enough for two as an app.  The Da Shoyu Mein entree (ramen / pulled pork / korean pickled bean sprouts shoda shoyu tare / 30 min egg / scallions sauteed mushrooms) I ordered cost $12.  $12.   Server was quick/attentive/knowledgeable.  Laughed at our jokes.  That's important...you know...to me.    Didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Though the cocktail menu prices were consistent with a downtown restaurant (read:  high) the food was inexpensive.  Your bar bill WILL end up costing more than your food.  But...in downtown Pittsburgh, the price point of the cocktails is right there with surrounding venues.  With Pittsburgh's restaurant-rich vibe, the True test of a restaurant for me is whether or not I'd return.  There are just too many great new untried restaurants to go back to a mediocre visit. I will definitely be back!  Food: 4.5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 (it's clean, pretty, dark marble, polished fixtures...but nothing extraordinary) Price point: 6 (whatever.  I can do what I want in the text of the review) Overall combination:  5  Great for dates, happy hours, Asian comfort food, relax and have a drink",

We were seated right away. The waiter was attentive at first, however, in the middle of our meal our waiter just stopped checking on us. After awhile, there was another waiter that came check on us instead. We ran out of water for awhile, he never filled our water so we eventually asked for more water. It's not a big deal really. Our first waiter might just really needed to leave. Anyway, I was excited that they have stir fry Raman. I ordered chicken Raman, my boyfriend ordered a curry dish, and our friends got Raman. They all love their dishes. However, I wasn't a fan of mine at all. It tastes like Americanized chinese Raman. I couldn't quite tell which flavor is too strong, maybe it's sesame oil. I was disappointed everyone likes their dish but me. I think I will come back again if I get a chance, but I'll have to try their other dishes.",

    "text": "Visited with my sister for a Thursday happy hour to try some snacks and ramen! The happy hour specials are pretty good, $5 cocktails, other drink specials, and some half priced apps!  There weren't many people when we stopped by (one other party of two), but the inside has a lot of space and is very nicely decorated. Service seemed a little awkward - We walked in to a pretty empty restaurant, made eye contact with a couple of workers and the bartenders but received no greeting. After walking through the restaurant, we were about to just seat ourselves when one of the workers came up to us and asked if we were a party of two.  We were led to a table and given menus. The waitress left and brought back water, and my sister asked if all of the apps were half off for happy hour (we only had online reviews to go off of at this point). The waitress seemed a bit monotone and grumpy, but replied that she'd get us a happy hour menu. We were a bit confused as to why we didn't receive that menu right off the bat, but no harm done.  We ordered a couple of apps to share and a bowl of ramen each. The apps were really tasty - we tried the karaage and cha-siu bao. Both were really fresh and flavorful!   I got the vegetable curry ramen. The broth was a lot less flavorful than I hoped, as were the other vegetables and tofu that came in it. The noodles were a good texture, but the dish seemed very bland, especially compared to the appetizers we'd just eaten.  Overall, we enjoyed the food, especially the appetizers, but felt the service was not very friendly or attentive. If I visit again, I would probably go for more appetizers and maybe try an entree other than the ramen; they did have a wide array of noodles and stir-fry.",

Everything on the menu looked good so I thought it would be promising. Sadly I was left very disappointed.   I ordered a ramen bowl and paid extra to add kimchi. Once I got it back to my desk I realized they charged me for the kimchi but neglected to add it to my bowl which was very upsetting. I absolutely love kimchi so this was a big strike for me. On top of that their ramen is fairly pricey which was another complaint I had. Lastly, the ramen was very bland and tasteless. All of those things combined resulted in me having to give Yuzu a fairly low rating.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch on a Friday.  I ordered the salt and pepper tofu and the veggie ramen.  Total was around $18 (not including tip).  What's Hot - Quality.  Yummers!  The broth is nicely flavored and seasoned.  For ramen, a nicely seasoned broth is super important.  Not too salty.  There's some pepper in the broth and green scallions, as well, which adds a nice kick.  Their veggie ramen has the tasty button mushrooms (not the regular western white mushrooms), tofu (which is probably pan fried) and pieces of seaweed.  Some of their ramen options come with a boiled egg, which looks like it's been slightly marinated/stewed, which adds to the flavor.  My friend's ramen came with bak choy.  It's nice to see they're including truly Asian veggies/sides in their dishes.  Their salt and pepper tofu appetizer is slightly breaded and fried, but not overly so.  It's nicely flavored- not too salty- and there's a slight kick.  For me, it's important that fried food isn't overly/thickly battered.  That usually means there's less flavor and you may be trying to hide something.   - Variety.  There's something for everyone- vegetarian and non vegetarian, ramen dishes, stir fries with rice, etc...   - Price.  Veggie ramen is $11 and the salt and pepper tofu is $6.  Without tip, that's under $20, which isn't so bad. - Location.  It's a convenient location in downtown and within walking distance of many places.  Because it's downtown, be prepared to walk here. - Service.  It was good and not bad, but be prepared for slowdowns when it's busy.        What's Not - Reservation.  This is only bad for those who do not know you really do need a reservation.  That you need a reservation means this place is popular and does well, so be prepared.  My friend made a reservation for a Friday lunch, people.  When we arrived, they couldn't find the reservation, but were able to find a table for us in the back.  My friend said the restaurant may have lost her reservation, because she made it too early.  Early??  Uh, she made the reservation one week ago.  How is that too early?  It looks like this place gets busy fast, especially during the weekdays.   - Portions.  Their ramen is a decent size, but it's small.  It's not enough to get full.  If you're looking for a fully satisfying meal, in terms of portions, I recommend you order their stir fries.      Final Answer Willing to come back, but make a reservation!",

    "text": "Reading other Yelp reviews of Yuzu led me there in December. Several reviews mentioned the goyza - and for good reason! We started with an order and the spring rolls. Both were done very well. The dumplings were very well done and the spring rolls were crispy and the sauce was nice and tangy. The spring rolls do have large mushrooms in them - which I didn't mind, but was a turn off for the other half of my party.  I am a noodle fan, so we skipped the ramen and went straight for the noodle options.   Basil: Ordered with chicken. Tasty and cooked well, but given my affinity for spice, I had to add some to it.  Peanut Noodles: Interestingly enough, if someone had handed me a dish of this and asked what I was eating I would have said with strong certainty that it was Pad Thai... very similar tastes. Luckily, that's one of my favorite dishes so I was on board! The tofu was fried and delish.  Beverages: I was more interested in beer than the cocktail list this night so I settled on a Sapporro. $9 for a 22oz is a bit high for Pittsburgh - but they did also have Kirin Ichiban for $5 and a handful of other options. We missed happy hour, so I'm guessing an earlier arrival would make these options more affordable.",

Though all the tables around me are getting constant attention, I guess because I'm alone I'm not worth as much.   My app came a full 15 minutes later. The Takoyaki are spicy octopus balls that at first seem too spicy, but the spice grows on you in a good way and they are ultimately satisfying.   The ramen followed quickly, and was just the thing on a day the temperature was -2 degrees. I chose the Sukiyaki Ramen, as I'm not a big fan of spice. Hearty and satisfying.   While I started out feeling neglected, the waitress in the end was very sweet. She checked on me once, which, for me, is the perfect amount.   The food was pretty good. The service was adequate.",

    "text": "Walked in during dinner time on a weekday and luckily, towards the end of happy hour. It wasn't busy at all, so me and my dinner date were quite a bit skeptic.. but we said \"eh, this place is new, let's give it a chance!\"  First things first. Their ramen is a definite upgrade from instant ramen, but I don't know if this was a meal that blew me away. It was as if something was missing or felt as though the soup didn't have very much depth to it?  SPICY KARAAGE ($4, HH*): Not spicy. Came out fresh and crispy. It was good, but also not that flavorful? The paprika aioli made up for that! MOSCOW MULE ($5, HH*): Typical moscow mule here, tasted a bit on the strong side though. My date had the Old Maid which was really refreshing and didn't even taste very alcoholic (probably because it was gin?) RAYU PAITAN ($15): Our server's favorite. Yum, I loved the cha-shu. Like I said though, it felt a little bit like it had something missing I guess. It wasn't amazingly delicious, but it did give me the vibes of an authentic ramen. If you aren't looking for spicy, either ask for the rayu (pepper sauce) on the side or get the 2nd favorite miso paitan. *Happy Hour  I really liked the trendy atmosphere and the cherry blossom painted on the wall. Service was great, very attentive and kind servers. Not a lot of choices for food, but that's good for those indecisive people. They seem to have a very large drink menu too if that's what you'd be interested in. (Japanese whisky?! What's a whisky highball? I'd come back to try that.)   It is likely that I'd return to Yuzu Kitchen if I'm in downtown, but I don't know if I would go out of my way to eat here. Definitely worth a shot though if you're debating on coming!",

We went in the afternoon a couple months ago and it wasn't packed but I got the sense it's pretty popular in the evenings. We both got ramen- which was delicious. If you go that route I definitely advise spending the extra money loading up on the toppings and use all of the chili oil they give you to amp up the flavor.  You could definitely make your own ramen at home that would be just as good as this place (with the right ingredients) for a lower price but it was a nice break from cooking and the ambiance was very peaceful and relaxing.",

I thought the actual meat portions in the ramen was very, very small; the overall portion was reasonable and fair, just there should have been more pork belly.   Skipping the lack of meat, the food was decent; though I liked Ki Ramen in Lawrenceville a lot more for both their ramen and the apps they offered. This place offers a lot more than just ramen, so maybe the other dishes are better. But I won't be ordering ramen here again.",

Had their squid karaage, tempura shrimp, string bean chicken, and tang tang mein.  All were very tasty but had to take one star off because it was a little salty for me.  Yuzu is on par with a lot of the 3 & 4 Star Japanese restaurants in Cali.   The two appetizers were great.  Tempura batter was light and crispy, squid was soft and not rubbery.   String bean chicken had great flavors and chicken was very tender.   Tang Tang Mein had a little spicy kick from the kimchi and noodles were perfectly cooked.   If you are looking for a good asian restaurant in downtown I highly recommend Yuzu!",

    "text": "** Good service and good atmosphere but very mediocre ramen, nothing special about the taste. Decent deals for drinks and appetizers (apps) at happy hour.  Noticed this place as a new restaurant in downtown that serves ramen, so I decided to try it out since ramen (or good ramen) is hard to find or basically non existent in Pittsburgh. I initially made a reservation at 6:30, and since I was worried I would be late I called in and they seemed totally chill about it.. turns out when I got there I noticed there was nobody else in the restaurant at Thursday ~6:45 PM so that made me a little uneasy.  Since it was still happy hour, I ordered an old maid ($5) and the spicy karage - fried chicken ($4). Both were pretty good.. basically tasted exactly as you might expect.  But let's focus on the ramen cuz that's the main point of the restaurant. I ordered the Rayu Paitan with the hot sauce on the side. Im from the Bay Area, so maybe my standards are too high but nothing about the ramen was special to me besides the bowl they put it in. My main disappointment was in the noodles, which I thought did not have a good texture. They seemed too soft and bland, and in my opinion for good ramen they need to be nice and chewy. I'm not a huge fan of chicken broth based ramen, so I wished they had sesame based options, like kuro ramen which is my favorite. Three slices of pork belly, egg, and corn.. but none of it really stood out.  Positives: Pretty friendly and helpful staff. Nicely decorated for a good vibe and also a good place to talk since it wasn't loud (but then again no one was there).",

All the food was flavorless especially the ramen. It was also expensive. Bad food at high prices. They also discontinued the Robata grill. This was a big disappointment as it was the reason we went.  The good news is that YuZu is under going a transition. They will be having a buffet and bubble tea. I hope they use this chance to make better food.  The second star is because the service was good.",

It's an intimate venue with a long bar, interesting and beautifully carved tables for larger groups and cozy tables in the back.  The happy hour is a terrific bargain with lots of drink options and really tasty appetizers.  The ramen cannot be beat--a far cry from my college days of noodle packets!   Jeffrey, Jack, Alec and Alice have all made our visits special with wonderful & attentive service. Kudos to them! The chef is always personable & comes to say hello and check on your meal.

We both ordered the spicy pork belly ramen and I thought it could use a bit more salt and spices in the broth. The eggs that came in the ramen were awesome. It was the most flavor filled egg I've ever had. They need to put that same flavor in the broth. The rest of vegetables that came in the dish were good.   I will definitely return and try something different next time. Great addition to downtown pittsburgh!",

I went with three girlfriends for lunch and the food was good enough - my favorite was the gyoza that we shared - but none of the other dishes really were memorable. What was memorable is that our server forgot to put half of our food in.. and didn't realize until we asked about it after sitting awkwardly for 30 minutes. At that point we needed to get back to work so we asked to take the food to go, and we were assured that those items would be removed from our check. But when the check arrived they hadn't been removed so we had to remind her, which was also pretty awkward. Overall... not my favorite. I might go back to try it again, but there are so many good lunch spots downtown that I'd rather not risk it!",

Upon entering Yuzu Kitchen, my family saw very hip decor, loud lively music, fashionable front house and waitstaff, and moody lighting. All of this, maybe to distract from, in my opinion, very subpar ramen! It seems the trendier a place is, the worse the food they serve. Ivan Orkin, in his sage wisdom, has always said that the two main players in a bowl of ramen are, the broth first and the noodles second (for him, the egg comes in a close third). So sad to say, the broth is passable but without depth and complexity. The disaster, however, were the noodles. No kansui taste and no bite, no chew! The noodles literally mushed when I pushed them up to the roof of my mouth with my tongue!? It wasn't that it stayed at the pass for too long as I heard the \"order up\" bell ring. It was plain and simply cooked for way too long..a sad rookie mistake or negligence. I can't tell..but I do hope they sort it out..if they truly want to be considered a proper ramen restaurant.. #talesoftheramenrabbit #ramenclubnyc #thankgoditsramen",

Then when we asked for a drink menu, we were given one for eleven people.... it was as if only 2-3 people could order a drink at a time and wait another 15-20 minutes to get it.   When asking questions about the menus, the server seemed irritated and short. Then we sat for an unreasonable amount of time before ordering dinner.   To top it off, there were only two other tables around so it's not as thought they were swamped. At least then I could understand the poor service.   The ramen was not worth the hype. Most of it was over cooked. The only thing that I thought was good was the takoyaki.   Also, if you plan on going with a group, you cannot split checks. You can sit the check evenly by a number of cards which wasn't a huge deal, but we weren't told until we were ready to pay. I would think they would tell you this upfront to make paying easier.   Everything about Yuzu Kitchen was a letdown. This is definitely not a place we would return to.",

I decided to join my partner and his coworkers for a Friday afternoon work lunch. To make a long story short Yuzu Kitchen does not split bills for parties of more then 3. From the moment we walked in we were mishandled. There were two waitresses servicing our small party. I don't like buddy waitressing as it always seems to have a negative impact on food delivery and this occasion at Yuzu Kitchen was no exceptions. When we were initially seated we were told by the waitress that she seated us separately so that we could split our check only to find out later that was BAD information and that indeed one check was delivered for $179.   My food came out cold most likely due to poor timing in the kitchen and 2 of the 8 orders were missed up. What should have been a 40 minute work lunch turned into an hour and a half cluster and on top of all of that the waitress's gratuity was included for a party of 8 what a joke.  I'm disturbed at just how bad this was. I will not be returning!",

    "text": "This downtown restaurant was on my list of \"gotta try some day\" restaurants in the burgeoning downtown Pittsburgh restaurant scene for a few months. I decided to check it out with a friend for lunch during the week.    There was some kind of building scaffolding on the sidewalk outside of the entrance which made it even harder to find.  Thank goodness for the silver mailbox with their street number emblazoned on it or we might still be wandering around looking for the place.  The doorway is sort of set back from the street in case you have trouble too.  We had no idea how cute the interior would be that greeted us.  The chandelier above the bar is really beautiful and the color palette they used is calming and earthy.  It's perfect for a ramen place. The hostess seated us quickly and the waitress took our orders within a few minutes.    We shared a pot of hot jasmine green tea that was very flavorful and the perfect temperature.  Sometimes tea in those pots is just lukewarm and sort of bath tub temp range.  Yuck.  This was nice and hot.   The Ramen bowls were filled with flavor and different textures and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  The 30 minute egg was packed with delicious flavors and was a brownish color, presumably from soaking in that amazing bath of broth.  The pork belly and mushrooms just took the whole Shio Paitan Ramen over the top.  Really tremendous bowl of ramen.  My friend has the spicy Rayu Paitan which was similar to the Shio Paitan but carried a nice kick to it.   I would definitely like to try some of the other dishes and I hear they have a nice sake happy hour during the week.  I mean, really, who doesn't like sake cocktails and delicious bowls of ramen after a long day at work?",

I ordered the lunch special Korean Stir Fry with chicken for $9 - the only \"side\" you get is rice (white or fried). I have to say that I did find it amusing that they actually communicate it on the menu like rice isn't NORMALLY included when you order stir fry! Wow, because that cup and a half of white rice that cost Yuzu like $.02 was frankly 90% of what I ended up with in my lunch. The portion of chicken and vegetables was what I'd equate to a \"children's\" portion - certainly not comparable to the lunch portion sizes you get at other downtown Asian spots.  As for the flavor/quality of the food - no impressed, not pleased. The veggies were mushy and I ended up with a few pieces of chicken that I had to spit out.  I may give this place another try, but at least for a little while, I'm steering clear of this waste of money...",

We ordered the spicy dumplings, Ribeye Brussel sprouts, and shrimp. These all came out very quickly and were delicious. Definitely small portions though so you can order many different ones and share. We also had the general tso chicken with fried rice which was a good typical general tso.  Minor complaints would be that there was one drink menu for 8 people and that they didn't split the check at all. We knew we were a large party but we sat at three different tables. I was hoping they would at least split each table separately. Otherwise, this place was great and I'd definitely be back for a date night or smaller group.",

Persoanlly, I do not think it is worth.  *LUNCH*  Yuzu's shio Ramen (most popular): This was recommended to me by the waitress because it contained both the mayu (sesame and garlic oil) and rayu (chili oil) in the soup. The egg was good and a bit runny, just how I like it. There was only like 4 pieces of chasiu, which made me a bit sad. Ramen is all about the noodle and the soup. The noodles were okay, I wish it was more softer. The soup was a disappointment. There was depth to the flavor of the broth and I only tasted the chili oil. Definitely would not get again.  Kaarage curry ramen:  My friend ordered this and I had a sip of the soup and I liked it so much more than the yuzu shio's broth. Maybe this one is worth trying.",

    "text": "I have been hearing great things about Yuzu for a long time now. We opted for multiple appetizers and two entrees when we went- splitting everything in order to taste as much as possible. My favorite appetizer that we had was the \"Cha-su bao\"-SO good. The wontons were also notable. For our mains, we went with the Wonton Ramen and General Tso's chicken. I thought both were served as very large entrees which allowed us to take some home for the next day. My favorite part of the meal was the house made Yuzu soda! I would return for that alone.",

    "text": "How did I miss this place?!?  For or monthly dinner date my roommate and I tried YuZu kitchen. We arrived on a Tuesday around 6:00 just after work to find the place was really full. After we saw the happy hour deals we no longer wondered why (happy hour is 5-7 with great deals on literally everything!)   We were sat at a table within minutes and a server quickly took our order. The menu has anything from dumplings to Ramen bowls to rice dishes. I ordered my traditional General Tso Chicken while Marissa has a noodle dish. We also had the pork dumplings to start as they were on the happy hour menu for only $4 (it's an order of 6).   Our food took no time at all to arrive. Portions are large enough that you'll have left overs for lunch the next day. Marissa and I were extremely happy with the flavor of our dishes.   I can't express how happy I am to have found this place. I really loved everything about my visit to YuZu. I'd love to visit again to try one of the ramen dishes. They also have a great event space in an upstairs loft area that we explored after dinner.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Friday's ago with my wife for dinner.  We were attending the Nutcracker later in the evening at the Benedum and so I got on a computer to find a place nearby and Yuzu was one of the places that came up.  We both like ramen and other Japanese foods so this was the perfect place.  The inside of the restaurant here is pretty large with a bar on the left side and then seating on the right and behind it.  Our host originally tried to seat us near the bar area but since it was around the holidays the bar was pretty crowded and so we had to ask her to seat us further in the back.  The inside of this place definitely has a Japanese feel to it with the Sakura hanging around, the anime like art on the bathroom doors and the mural of a cherry blossom tree.  As others have mentioned the happy hour here is pretty amazing and since we had arrived during it, my wife and I took advantage of it.   So for our appetizers we went with some takoyashi as well as some sat and pepper tofu.  The menu describes the takoyashi as 4 fried octopus croquettes with spicy mayo, nori eel sauce, katsubushi and sesame seeds and describes the salt and pepper tofu as fried tofu with garlic, scallion, jalapeno and garnished with fried red onions.  We enjoyed both of them and while I thought that the takoyashi was going to be my favorite of the two, I was wrong.  It was the golden brown tofu with the perfect amount of seasoning on it which I really enjoyed.  Then for my dinner entree I went with the spicy seafood ramen while my wife went with the karaage curry ramen.  My dish was described as having spicy seafood broth, lemongrass, mushrooms, pei mussels, shrimp, tomato and scallions.   It was an ok dish but for something that was described as spicy, I don't think that mine was particularly spicy.  Since the broth helps to make the dish that was a bit of a letdown although I did enjoy the ramen noodles themselves as well as the shrimp and mussels.  My wife was a much bigger fan of her dish even though we had to look up what karaage (tang fry) was before we ordered.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Yuzu has some great prices during their happy hour and my wife and I enjoyed almost everything that we tried.",

Both of us had ramen-- Yuzu special and their shoyu. Surprisingly they were out of the sukiyaki ramen, which was a bit disappointing but was one of the more unique ramen on their menu.   The ramen here is some of the better ramen I've had in Pittsburgh, with a tasty broth and generous additional seasonings (chili oil, garlic oil, etc.). Their presentation is great, where they allow you to see each item and choose whether to mix it in yourself. Noodles were okay: probably not handmade but with enough body for the soup to stick to it. Charsiu was cooked more gently, so the texture and flavor was a little less melt-in-your-mouth and more tender boiled meat. The portion size was good!  The atmosphere here is really nice-- warm and intimate without being too loud (on a Monday night). Tables are a bit close to each other for pairs of diners, which might have been an issue on a busier night. The only thing that makes me a bit hesitant to recommend this place to friends is the price-- one bowl of ramen ranges $11-$15 dollars, without extra toppings.",

Chicken lettuce wraps were a great starter. Nice light appetizer that is packed with flavor.  My husband and I shared a Seafood Feast that we were both satisfied with. Lobster, shrimp and squid were fried with tempura and mixed with bell peppers and chili peppers. Definitely had a kick to it so if you can't handle heat, I would request to change the spice level.  I loved the decor and atmosphere.  A very nice place for a date night in the Pittsburgh area.",

Strangely the delivery guy came on bike...from the southside..to Mt Washington....like up the incline?? Amazingly the food was still warm enough.   I got the Singapore noodles which are reviewed by lots of people on yelp. Sadly they were just so bland. We also got an order of the garlic chicken which was bland as well. Just very one note overall.   Next time I'll try something different. I'm interested in the poke bowls and sushi for sure.",

    "text": "Today I tried Yuzu Kitchen for the first time with my friend. The restaurant is decorated very nicely with a great ambiance - a trendy, modern vibe with some tasteful Asian influences. They even had cherry blossom branches decorated some areas.   I think Yuzu is a really nice place for appetizers and drinks, especially since the happy hour (4:30-6:30) has some great deals. I split an order of karaage bao (fried chicken on steamed bun) and we really enjoyed this item! The flavor and texture was in point! I would definitely come back to try more appetizers and maybe the drinks since they sounded quite nice!  For dinner, we both ordered off the stir fry section of the menu. While I enjoyed my food, chili garlic vegetables, I felt that the flavor was missing some of the complexity and veggies missing some of the perfect crispness I have come to expect in a nice quality Chinese dish. I was also a bit confused why the entrees were either ramen or Chinese style dishes, when the rest of the dishes and restaurant was clearly Japanese. It was tasty, the portion good (not as large was some Asian restaurants have allowed me to come to anticipate), but I don't think this dish would bring me to order it again.   Many of the other guests at the restaurant were eating ramen, so maybe I would consider that next time. The ramen menu is fairly extensive - they do have a vegetarian option and lots of customizable additions for the ramen. I think I try Yuzu again next time I am in the mood for a tapas and drinks evening. I would get the bao again - maybe they'll add more bao flavors if I am lucky!",

I got a $6 mule and it was pretty good.  For an app, we got the chashu bao which is essentially a pork belly slider. I really enjoyed it! Especially for $3.50! We also got the karaage which is literally just a chicken nugget fried with tempura breading. My husband really enjoyed it! For entrees, I ordered the Singapore noodles and added shrimp. I really really enjoyed it! It was a huge portion and packed with lots of fresh Ingredients. My husband got the sukiyaki (beef) ramen and loved it as well. He drank every last drop.

The shrimp tempura has no real shrimp inside, or it's just too small that we can't taste it. Ohh the ramen, where do I start. The noodles are soggy, nothing chewy at all.The soup is horribly salty with too much soy bean sauce. The cha-shu is inedible, it's all fat, it's neither Hong Kong style nor Japan style, it's basically a slice of pork belly soaked in soy been sauce. Other toppings just added to the saltiness. In the end both me and my friends only finished the egg in the Ramen, nothing more. Will not recommend and will not come again.",

Happy hour appetizer specials are very good.  Drink specials used to include a decent red and white wine, but no more.  Service was average to slow there, and all but one of our checks were wrong.    Now on to the table.  Here, there were many faux pas... - Our group of 6 sat down, only to be informed that their new policy (as of two weeks ago) is that groups of more than 5 can't have itemized checks.  They can split the whole check evenly or not at all.  I asked for the manager on this one, as this was not disclosed on the website or when I made the reservation.   The manager did accommodate us because I refused to back down, but not until after a lengthy discussion on the matter.   He basically said that all the other customers just accepted it (and thus I was unreasonable) and explained that his staff was simply too incompetent to figure out separate checks.  Insert eye roll here.   - At happy hour, you can order a Moscow mule.  After happy hour, there's no button on the computer for that, so you simply cannot order one.  Nevermind that they have a full bar and clearly have all the stuff to make one.  We didn't have a problem paying full price, but since the computer doesn't have it, there is no price and it's just not an option.  So we ordered nothing instead.  Insert eye roll here.   - I ordered the ribs as an appetizer.  They're out of those.   It happens, but it's annoying.  And combined with the rest of the experience, was just another thing.  Instead, I did a version of bao (couldn't tell you exactly which because the menu online doesn't match the one provided in the restaurant).  These were 90% bun and 10% filling at best.    - One of our group ordered her stir fry without onions or scallions.  It came with both. She picked them out...our waiter didn't notice or comment.  She then wrote a note about it (super passive-aggressive and not really acceptable, but at this point we were beyond baffled by the place). The waiter picked up the plate and the note without a word and walked off.  Her check was wrong as well.    The place was super busy at happy hour, but immediately cleared out to almost nothing ten minutes later.  I guess people put up with this nonsense for cheap eats, but don't stay after that?     Overall, my food was average at best -nothing special.  But the service really brought the place down. The host and server were both nice, but did make some serious errors.  Many of those seem to be a top-down problem though.  Which I can see because the manager's attitude was really off-putting as well.   Whatever the case, I certainly won't be back.",

I had two cocktails on HH for $5 a piece (HELLO STEAL!) one was a bourbon lavender bitter mixture and the other was a rum etc etc base- both were STRONG And I second guessed my decision in getting two (just kidding, I'm lying) . I ordered the gyoza, which admittedly is one of the best meat fillings I've had and I always thought Seattle had it on lock for gyozas and the like....anyway, I digress. I also got the edamame, which is self explanatory, however it did not taste like it was purchased in bulk and frozen for months over so that's a win in my book. Bartender was nice and attentive. No bathroom use so I can't speak to the experience but overall would recommend m friends to visit from 4:30-6:30 for Happy hour!",

    "text": "What a fantastic happy hour! Half priced appetizers and drink specials. It was perfect for us before catching a show in the cultural district. My wife started off with the grapefruit Collins (actually an orange Collins since they ran out of grapefruit juice). She was it was great! She actually ordered a second.  For food we ordered the takoyaki, spicy karrage, salt and pepper tofu, and chashu bao . These were all $3-$4 during happy hour. The takoyaki was great. The octopus balls were delightful and the paired sweet sauce was on point. Spicy karrage could've used a tad bit more salt but was perfectly crunchy while still juicy inside. Chashu bao reminded me of eating Peking duck but with pork belly. It had the scallions and the hoisin sauce. The pork belly was absolutely delicious. The highlight of the appetizers was the salt and pepper tofu. They were lightly fried and dressed with thin scallions and fried onion pieces. Wow! These were amazing! I don't work around downtown but would stop by often for their happy hour if I did. Great service and great food.",

    "text": "Since opening a few years ago, Yuzu has been a popular ramen spot downtown, and today, coworkers and I decided to try it. It's not a super fancy place, but everything was really nice inside- it'd be an appropriate date night restaurant. Since ramen seems to be their specialty, I gave it a go.  Vegetable ramen: 4.2/5 Dense, bold flavors penetrated my taste buds from the first sniff. I'm doing a little bit of macro counting so while I really wanted a ramen with pork belly, the fat content was too steep for me, so vegetable ramen it was... and it did not disappoint! As a meat-eater generally, the tofu was a little off-putting in color and texture but it tasted just fine! I can't really compare to other tofus, but I was satisfied with the protein. The broth had just the right amount of salt and was packed with rich foreign flavors. The noodles, I think, could have been a little more cooked through. I knocked a few points because towards the bottom of my bowl, the texture in the broth got grainy and had a strange, dominating aftertaste. I'm assuming this is because the ingredients were not integrated enough in the cooking and absorbing process.   Pro-tip: add a 30-min egg for $1. It was sweet and gooey and incredible. Do not skip out on it. I also went ahead and added kimchi and bok choy because why the h*ck not?  For $16 ($11 plus all my extras), this dish isn't an every month kind of thing, but it does taste dy-no-mite! I'd try another one, as long as it comes with the 30-min egg. Gotta get that recipe...",

    "text": "3 big disclaimers to my review: 1.) Me and 3 friends went for dinner service during 4th of July 2.) I'm pretty sure there was only 1 person taking orders (and doing the bar) and 2 serving assistants. He tried to keep everything under control and didn't seem too rushed but I felt bad for how he was taking basically the whole restaurant. 3.) Asian vs. Asian Fusion are two different things to me.   Also, I just noticed their online menu is like 80% correct compared to their in-house one.  My boyfriend and my actual order: - Bacon-wrapped Shrimp (4 pcs) - Xiao Long Bao (5 pcs) - Salt and Pepper Tofu - Beef and brussel sprouts - Sichuan stir fry green beans with shrimp  - Bacon wrapped shrimp wasn't actually as bad as it looked. It didn't taste like much of anything but looked like it was overfried and a little burnt  - Xiao Long Bao -- if you really are expecting soup dumplings, go somewhere else. The dough was more like siaopao so even if there was actual soup in there, it gets absorbed so it's just like a siaopao vs. an actual Xiao long bao. Big disappointment there. - Sichuan stir fry green beans w/ shrimp not really much flavor. Definitely no spice despite it being supposedly stir fried with the Sichuan peppercorns distinct from the region. No spice, no flavor. Not worth the money, that's for sure.  - Salt and Pepper tofu was probably one of my favorite things, well made to my liking and savory.  - Beef and brussel sprouts I didn't get to taste, I left that up to my dude.   Also, looking at the menu, a lot of things are described in quotes which I thought would be pretty cool. Like a signature one liner to describe every dish but nah, everything fried had in quotes \"fried golden and delicious\" or something to that note. It's on like 1/3 of all their items. Was funny the first couple times I noticed it but the rest of the menu made me think if they couldn't take the time with their menu, they probably won't with the food either.   The ONLY thing saving it from 1 star is the tofu and the drinks. I forgot what the name of my drink was (it's not listed in the online menu) but it was pretty damn good although it could have been more spicy.  Edit: I probably should have known better now that I think about it, I broke my own rule and ordered Chinese food at a Japanese restaurant. Dumb mistake.",

The wontons in the ramen were fine but, the noodles were a bit too soft for my tastes and there wasnt even a lot of flavor in the broth. I also asked for the broth to be spicy, but still needed to get a side of chili oil because it just did not have enough spice to it. Additionally, the portion size of the ramen was reasonable (fair for a relatively nicer sit-down restaurant) but our appetizer had the smallest slices of scallion pancakes and only came with a total of 4, which was the part I did not think was reasonable.   I'm giving this review a 3 (rather than a 2) because the service was good and the ambience of the place was modern and filled with Cherry Blossom aesthetics but if you're looking for a good taste of ramen, I would not recommend this place unfortunately.",

I can't tell you how hard it is for me to find a solid restaurant that serves a  decent ramen dish, so finding this place was a real treat for myself and company. Yuzu's other selection to choose from shouldn't be overlooked as well, their appetizers were a good insight of how good the meal was going to be in my opinion.  Another thing to note is their alcohol selection, now I'm not much of a drinker but I found their selection much more vast than I was expecting. Which is great for someone picky about what to drink like myself! Other positive notes to touch on was the service I had. Polite, consistent follow ups with how our meal was going and fast pace service was everything I could have ever hoped for at an establishment.   Overall Yuzu's Kitchen is a must in the Pittsburgh area!",

My friend and I actually ordered a lot of food, we were hungry and couldn't decide. We had ribeye Brussel sprouts, salt and pepper tofu, edamame, Bao buns and spring rolls. All of these dishes were good. The tofu was a bit too much fried for me but my friend loved it. The Brussels were very oily and the fat from the ribeye literally drenched them. But I think that was the point! I loved the edamame, cooked perfectly. The bao buns are sweet and savory. And the spring rolls were soooo crispy and good.   I ended up getting the Shoyu Tare ramen. No mushrooms but put corn instead. It's a good dish. I appreciate that their broth isn't overly salty which can truly ruin the ramen. It's good with their chili oil, too, kicks it up a bit. Good chunks of bok choy and pork belly. I especially like the egg they put in, its creamy and delicious.   My friend got chicken stir fry with sweet garlic chili. I tried it myself and it was really good. I would probably try the stir fry never time, if I'm honest.   The price is good, too. Not too expensive but not the cheapest. It's a solid place for ramen and I'd go back!",

I was very hesitant to try it as I have never been a tofu person. But once I took a bite I was sold! It's fantastic.",

I started with the stir fried bok choy which was very tasty followed by the char siu pork ramen.  The ramen was good with plenty of substance in it.  I added bean sprouts to my meal for more veggies.  It was lighter than traditional ramen in terms of flavor.  Overall good.    It was a good dining experience.  Do recommend if you are looking for ramen in the downtown Pittsburgh area.",

I finished the bowl clean because it was so delicious; faster then my date even!   I'm excited to come back here. It was a great experience and everyone was really nice and helpful with recommendations.",

It seemed good, but the noodles didn't cook properly and taste terrible. Do you see the noodles stick together?  Also, the noodles weren't much different from the noodles made at the factories that sell at Korean food markets. (2 dollars one)  I hardly understand why it is so high star.  In Korea or Japan,  I'm sure that if they provide these foods, you'll be ruined in six months.  If you say you've eaten here and have eaten ramen, it's a shame.  This is no more than just a piece of flour.  The ramen I ate in Boston was just as good as Korea or Japan, but in here, really really really x 1000 disappointed.  Moreover, how expensive is it? It is twice the price of Korea or Japan.  To get an expensive price in the United States, they need to improve their taste at least ten times better than now.",

I was on a work trip and it can be weird eating alone, but no one here will give you a pitiful look for slurping down noodles solo at the bar.

I might have to find another pressing reason to make another trip out here soon...",

The flavor was great and on such a cold day it was the perfect thing to warm my soul.  The spring rolls were pretty standard spring rolls which I can't complain.  Staff was nice.

Yuzu has a good selection of staples - the chashu was cooked perfectly, the broths were nicely layered and deep.  We even got to taste test some of the \"winter\" options coming up in the next few weeks, and damn.  Needless to say, we'll be going back in the next few weeks.  Salt/pepper tofu - don't like tofu?  Are you sure?  TRY this.  Like tofu?  Ooooh you're going to be happy with these.  Gyoza - standard, delicious. Chicken on a stick - sharing?  Hoard that peanut sauce.  Don't share it with your tablemates.    Rayu ramen - nice spicy kick, perfectly cooked chashu.  I added baby bok choy and was pleased with the decision. Miso ramen - NOM.  Pulled chicken?  Delicous. General Tso's (because why not?) - CRISPY.  DEEP SMOKY/SWEET FLAVOR.  Best General Tso's I've ever had, hands down  There were other things we ate - nothing disappointed.  I'm going to try and wrap this up.  EAT HERE.  Oh, and get the kimchi - this is a daikon radish kimchi.  As someone who lived in Korea for two years - do it.  DO IT.  Crunchy, spicy, umami.  It's everything.  The ONLY bad thing that I would have to say is that the noodles aren't anything to write home about, but they weren't bad and they didn't detract from the dishes.",

    "text": "So, I and one of my intrepid lunch partners-in-crime (LPIC) decided that we were going to check out Yuzu Kitchen because we had been meaning to go there, but with the addition of so many new restaurants in Downtown Pittsburgh, it took us a minute to get there.  But get there, we did! First of all, I'm a damn dumpling fanatic.  I don't care whose cuisine we're talking about, if they have a dumpling, I'm trying it.  I asked our server about the Gyoza at Yuzu Kitchen and she said that they were her favorites.  Say no more!  Put me down for the gyoza!  GBD(Golden, Brown and Delicious!) and moist and flavorful and freshly made and tasty and porky!  Yuzu Kitchen's gyoza rank up there with some of the best that I have had in San Francisco's and New York City's Chinatown neighborhoods. (I hate when restaurants serve \"frozen\" gyoza and try to pawn them off as house-made.  Yech!)  As far as our entrees, me and my LPIC were going to go with the ramen but decided to go with the \"Da Shoyu Mein\" at the last minute. Ramen noodles with pulled pork, Korean pickled bean sprouts, scallions, mushrooms and a 30 minute egg!  What form of madness is this?  Crazy goodness!  I swore off all forms of ramen noodles after college. (When the only thing that you can afford is 10 packs for a dollar ramen noodles and you eat them almost EVERY DAY for several years, you would swear them off too!)  However, Yuzu Kitchen made me a believer and we are already contemplating eating our way through the menu. (Just to make sure that they don't have anything bad on their menu.)  And while the space is small, it is truly artfully and elegantly designed.  Tres chic!  I'm just sorry that I didn't take any pictures, but I was so hungry that I was almost completely finished with my meal before I realized that I didn't really get good photos.  Anyway, you must go and I think that you will be impressed.",

I have been there 4 times so far and will keep going back unless something changes. I always go for the soup but I will have to try something other than that.

It comes in a large bowl that is only filled about half way. I finished my meal and was still hungry. Mentally it is difficult to get over the fact that you could get over 12 portions of freeze dried top ramen for the same price! Yes, not as good, but it would be a lot cheaper and more filling. I want to say I would give this place another try, as I'm curious and interested in exploring the menu some more, but i don't think I will be throwing this place into the regular lunch rotation.",

It was just okay. Nothing memorable about it and could have used some extra fixings to jazz it up a bit.   I will say I love the vibe in here. Although the two times I went it was literally empty on a Saturday evening, they had a nice playlist going and the bar area is super trendy. I'd be willing to come back and try their other vegan friendly apps.",

A young man in an apron approached me first to pour my water and that was a little confusing.  The menu is fairly small, and the drink selections (alcohol wise) weren't the greatest unfortunately (I forgot to ask if regular wine, beer, and liquor options existed). However, the purple drink (the name escapes me right now), was delicious when it came out.   I am the first to admit, I've been ignorant of TRUE ramen my entire life. I've only ever eaten the styrofoam bowl ramen and the microwave/hot water package ramen. To have REAL ramen for the first time was terrific, and I appreciate my server walking me through how to order it and what the differences were with patience, understanding, and appreciating the humor of it all.  To end- the ramen was amazing, the drink was delicious, and you should make your way here at the next available opportunity!",

I'm originally from Philadelphia area, where my go-to place was Nom Nom Ramen in the city and this is the most similar place I've found.  Apps/small plates are cheap(even cheaper during happy hour!) but still great quality, cooked and prepared perfectly. Ramen is amazing, the shio is great; yuzu bomb is so good. Love their gyoza, bao, and spring rolls. The atmosphere is very chill. Staff has always been very friendly. Wish I could visit more often, I would seriously eat here every day if I had the funds lol",

Unfortunately, the Miso at Yuzu was very bland.  No spice, the broth must have been ultra low MSG.  The chicken was likely purchased from Sysco or another food distributor, baked in the oven, then shredded.  No soul, no creativity.  What a bummer.  To be fair, I had a friend who really enjoyed his spicy ramen; however, I had one meal.  That being said, I believe that everything on the menu should be prepared with the same care as the best thing on the menu, so two stars it is for the high price and low flavor.",

My boyfriend and I arrived at this restaurant 15-20 minutes before the rest of our party arrived, so we decided to order a couple cocktails. It wasn't especially busy in the restaurant, but it took 30 minutes to get our drinks. By the time we got our drinks the rest of the party had arrived and had been seated for enough time to look over the menu and drink menu. Another member of our party was interested in wine and ordered something off of the wine list. He was told that they had almost none of the wines on that list. As for the ramen, I tried the Yuzu shio ramen, their so called specialty. It was too spicy and you couldn't taste the ramen at all. The quality of ramen was less than I would get making frozen ramen at home. At the end of our meal I want to the bathroom, and it was disgusting. Looked like no one had been in to clean it for at least a few days. Will never come back.",

I was surprised at how well done the design is and how upscale the materials used in the space are - I guess I just had no idea what to expect! I had a really hard time reading the menu. I feel like they could help with a definition or vocab list. Or atleast have the servers more forthcoming with explanations to help those that are uneducated. I was curious and asking questions but did not learn much about the menu's nuances :(  I ended up ordering what was described to me as an elevated ramen soup or sorts - \"Shoyu Tare Paitan pork marrow / chicken broth / shoda shoyu tare / scallions sauteed mushrooms / cha-shu (marinated pork belly) 30 min egg / corn / nori\".  I think I made a good choice - it was delicious! Our meal arrived within 5 mins and was very tasty and fulfilling. Great lunch spot or take out choice for those working downtown. Would like to return to try the curry options.",

Soupy, greasy, very small portion of stewed/rubbery meat that isn't all that appetizing. The sauce was salty without any spice or flavor. Definitely loaded up on the broccoli portion which is okay if the sauce was actually tasty. I was very disappointed but I guess that's what I get for ordering something more fusion based at a seemingly more Japanese styled restaurant. But why even offer it then?",

I like the fact that this place is more True to what an actual izakaya (Japanese pub) is supposed to be. There's an excellent place in Highland Park (Teppanyaki Kyoto), but all the other \"izakaya\" style restaurants in Pittsburgh are either knock offs or have completely missed the mark.

I tried some of the happy hour specials (1/2 off select appetizers and $6 cocktails) and after that, I can't wait to go back to try their ramen. Very unique for Pittsburgh.",

For my money, there is no better balance of quality mixology and price at Yuzu for happy hour. The cocktails are well-made, strong, and always changing. Overall, you will not be disappointed whether you're here for drinks or for food, or both.",

    "text": "First the decor is really cool. The service was great. She was very knowledgeable on what the items on the  menu are because it has a lot of un-familiar items. My husband got the Shio Paitan and he said it was the best he ever had! Very Flavorful and hearty. Me being a vegetarian was very underwhelmed and disappointed. For starters got the Bean Curd which wasnt bad but my entree of Veg  Ramon was bland, boring and hardly anything in it. I added some extra vegetable umami bomb to help which it didnt. I ended up putting spicy chili paste in it to give it some sort of flavor.  So this place is great for meat eaters but I wouldn't recommend it for Vegetarians at all. Just because I dont eat meat doesnt mean I just want bland empty bowl of tofu and noodles. I see from other reviews im not the only one who feels this way",

The bartender was super awesome and helpful when it came to being proactive and attentive. As I don't eat beef or pork and most of the ramen has pork marrow in it I went for the veggie Ramen and it wasn't what I thought it would be. The noodles were good, the vegetables were a nice touch but the broth was missing something. It didn't make the experience memorable. Will I go back for drinks and maybe appetizers? Yes! But the Ramen not so much. It's a nice after work spot with five dollar happy hour cocktails and half off apps.",

    "text": "The food is really good. Which is what keeps me coming back. And it seems like from reading other reviews that the service is not an issue for most. Perhaps the dinner staff is more professional? As a single woman I'm used to not getting good service and this place is a prime example of not getting it right. I don't like sitting at the bar because I'm short and I'm never comfortable trying to read a book and eat at the bar. Also, bartenders typically don't make good waiters. So if you do have to ask for something like extra spicy mayo, you get the invisible eye roll. With Yuzu, there always seems to be a hassle to get a table set up for me and then I just feel awkward - like I'm really putting them out. This is the routine whether the place is full or empty. Also, I usually have to practically pounce on the waiters to get things they forgot. Everyone seems involved in bringing out food so things tend to get messed up. And everyone seems really busy but not very efficient. When your waiter walks by 3 times without making eye contact, you tend to feel ignored. In general, the wait staff during lunch seems more interested in talking about their social lives than helping their customers. This is an upscale place with a beautiful decor - it's too bad the vibe isn't matched by the staff.",

    "text": "Ramen on a cold, wintry day might be the best thing ever invented.  I've been here twice and couldn't be happier.  Both times I have gotten ramen with the 30 minute egg which I highly recommend.  The first time I got the one with the pulled chicken which was excellent.  This last time I got the one with the pork belly and mushrooms which was very spicy, but also very delicious.   A bowl runs from $12-$15 and is enough for two meals, so long as you don't eat all the \"good stuff\" out in one sitting - I usually do and then am left with a bowl of just noodles and broth for leftovers, but I am happy with that as well.    Excellent downtown addition with very pleasant wait staff and bartenders.  Highly recommend.",
