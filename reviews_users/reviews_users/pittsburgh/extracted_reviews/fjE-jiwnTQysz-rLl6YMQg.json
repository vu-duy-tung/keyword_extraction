Decent portions & prices and tastes great (I didn't even have to add soy sauce on their fried rice)!  Good customer service to me so far (I've ordered from here twice).  Delivery time was about 30min on a weeknight which I thought was pretty decent.  Amazing Wok does not disappoint.",

I always observed the same woman and younger girl to be working there, the woman is a little high strung but I never waited longer than a couple minutes. To be honest the only thing I ever ordered here was the vegetable fried rice, and to the best of my memory a small was $1.85 and a large was $3.25. This place may have the best fried rice I've ever had! The rice is always moist, with peas and carrots and generous chunks of egg in it. If you are catching the T up the street, catching a bus home on West Lib or just in the area, stop in here and see what all the fuss is about.",

When I find a good spot that serves up yummy food that I can grab after working late then I'm all happy with only my pointer and pinky fingers extended...hand in the air! I stopped at this joint on one of those type of nights figuring I'd give em a shot after driving by on so many occasions.   From the outside it looks a lot like other take out Chinese spots...like they put no thought into design on the outside and threw up a few cheap embellishments on the inside, but really it's all about a delicious, piping hot good meal here.   We ordered the chicken lo mein, which was busting out of the square plastic container.  First bite revealed warm noodles with just the right amount of bite...like a good pasta should, full of flavor with the usual zig zag cut carrots, snow peas, sprouts, mushroom, onions and the starring protein this time, chicken. We also ordered the Land and Sea entree which is a spicy mix of vegetables, chicken and shrimp. My tastebuds sang a happy melody. Yes, I heard it!  The service was friendly and fast. Look, it wasn't a Sesame Inn type of meal but it wasn't supposed to be.  It was just yummy. My only complaint was the sauce on my entree was watery. I'm used to the thick, rich brown sauce on my entrees from Chinese restaurants but honestly...if that's the only complaint, I'm gonna be back to visit and try more.",

Recently, my BF and I have been watching our diets a little closer, and Amazing Wok still allows us to indulge in Chinese takeout without being unhealthy. What do I mean? I mean they have a diet menu. There is a section of different combinations (My favorite is the shrimp with mixed veggies) and then you can choose to either have it steamed with sauce on the side or have it stir fried in a lighter sauce! HEAVEN! We have ordered from this part of the menu several times and have never been disappointed.  You can also get brown rice, which is a big win in my book. I have splurged and enjoyed their steamed dumplings, egg rolls, and crab rangoon. All delicious.  Customer service has been excellent every time I have called, and they always read my order back to ensure that they have everything right.    Can not sing enough praised of Amazing Wok! If you're in their delivery area definitely give them a try! :)",

    "text": "I challenge you to find me better tasting Chinese food in Pittsburgh that's portioned as generously and priced as reasonably.  I've patronized this establishment on average about once a week for the last 2 years of living in the Brookline/Dormont area and I've only been disappointed once or twice, when \"they\" forgot my egg roll or I realized I neglected to mention I wanted my chicken with mixed vegetables steamed (so that second time was my fault).  Whether I do take-out or delivery, it's typically ready within 15 minutes or arrives at my door within 30 minutes.  The only criticism I have is that sometimes the woman who runs the place might come across as a little \"cold,\"  but I perceive that as she's just really that busy and trying to be as efficient as possible.  She's not rude or anything, says \"please\" and \"thank you\" and whatnot, but she can make me feel sometimes like I'd better hurry up and tell her what I want, which really, I don't mind, but I can see might be an issue for some people who want to be doted on and get a full-blown customer service experience.  So keep in mind she's not there to kiss butt.  She's there to get you some amazing Chinese food.  Seriously, do yourself a favor and go.  PS-  Most of their food is served in recyclable containers, so they're environmentally conscientious-- wash 'em out & recycle!",

    "text": "Yikes. Let's just say the Amazing Wok is NOT amazing. I should have known better because I read the reviews beforehand but I chose to listen to the wrong ones. Do not gamble on your dinner like I did - please go elsewhere.  I wanted some comfort food - you know, old school American Chinese food loaded with who knows what that just hits the spot. A simple mixed veggies with chicken in brown sauce, wonton soup and a shrimp egg roll. My fave place, My Thai, wasn't delivering, so I rolled the dice with this place. And simple is what I got...to the point of being bland and tasteless. My meal was impressively devoid of flavor.  The Good: The food was well-made. I saw actuality shrimp in the egg roll, the outside crust of the egg roll was made with real wonton wrappers, not that deep fried stuff, the veggies were fresh, the soup had actual shredded cabbage in it, and I think the meal was moderately healthy. So they get two stars for good quality and preparation.  The Bad: When I bit into my egg roll I thought \"uh oh.\" It wasn't terrible, it was just flavorless. I tried adding duck sauce but that didn't really help, and the only flavor that I could taste was actually the slightly buttery taste of the wonton wrapper. This trend continued to the main dish, which had a brown sauce with barely any flavor either. The most I could taste was a slight sweet quality but it was so underwhelming I found myself wishing I'd ordered plain steamed veggies so I could have made my own sauce at home. Salting it would not have helped because the sauce had a flat quality about it and would have required a mix of ingredients to give it depth.  The Ugly: Weirdly, after all of this terribly bland food, the wonton soup was like drinking salty bathwater. It's like they held back on salting anything and then accidentally poured the whole shaker into the soup. I was starving and I ate that before my main meal or else I might have been unable to consume it. I was so disappointed too because it was texturally a perfect wonton soup - the wontons weren't too thick or chewy, the broth had thin slices of pork and shredded cabbage in it and it would have been the best part of the meal if it hadn't been oversalted.  Anyways, I was terribly disappointed and felt led astray by all of the great reviews. I should have listened better to the reviewers who called it bland. I took a chance and wasted $20. Don't make my mistake.",

We ordered General Tso's chicken, Combo Lo Mein, Teriyaki Chicken on a stick, fried rice, won tons, and 3 egg rolls.  The won tons were very good but it went down hill from there.  The Tsos chicken was a bit soggy, the lo mein was also.  The fried rice was average and the egg rolls were rancid.  Not just soggy, not just cold, but had a slight bleachy smell and an off-putting taste.  My wife couldn't swallow her first bite, I mistakenly did.  Luckily I didn't get sick, but that really tainted the rest of our meal... I called the restaurant and told them about the egg rolls, and she seemed concerned, so hopefully they took care of them.   We, on the other hand, will never go back.  :(",

I'm pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food, but I would say Amazing Wok is one of the better Chinese restaurants I have eaten at and that's saying a lot. I've driven by Amazing Wok probably a hundred times and I was always a little leery to eat there because it looks pretty run down from the outside and in the window. But I'm so glad I finally tried their food.  Their prices are really good and the portions of food are huge. My meal lasted me 2 nights. The only downside is the menu is pretty small and there's just a couple vegetarian entree options.  I'll definitely be ordering from Amazing Wok many more times in the future.",

So after months of trial and error, I can tell you, without a doubt, Amazing Wok is the best game in town.  I've never stepped foot inside the establishment, but seriously, who eats takeout-grade chinese food in the restaurant itself?  No one, that's who.  So I'm basing this entire review off of the delivery.  First, the service.  You're greeted on the phone by an incredibly upbeat lady, who I assume works every waking moment of her life.  She doesn't seem like she has a great grasp on the language, but she's super friendly.  Next, the menu.  It's everything chinese takeout should be.  Cheap, decent, and forgiving on your insides.  Actually the food is pretty good, I usually order the chicken and garlic sauce lunch special, which comes to a whopping six dollars.  The chicken is cooked perfectly, the sauce is awesome, and you get rice and soup...awesome.  The best part is, is how long it takes to get to you.  I call, place an order, and in about the time it takes me to drive to where the restaurant is at, they're knocking on the door.  Are they just guessing what people are going to order?  It's not just amazing...it's scientifically fascinating.",
