The ceiling appears to be unfinished and now and then a \"heater\" would blow for a small time to try to warm the room. The menu specials are misleading. They advertised a stuffed shrimp with crabmeat for only $12.00 but in actuality that was really an appetizer. We ordered French onion soup and salads. The soup was very good. The salad I had was fair. On the plus side we received prompt and courteous attention. The menu appears to be overpriced so we decided not to go with the high ended dinners. Please note this is a \"chain\" restaurant. Dress is casual. Chances are we won't be coming back.",

Everything was great, from the staff, to the decor, and the food was very good. Tasty and fresh, perfectly done and very nice portions. The group tried a variety of dishes from burgers, to fish and pasta. Everyone was happy and it was delish, can't wait to go back!  Great menu! Great food! Great place! Cheers",

The have a nice wine selection including some local options I usually like to go with what the server recommends. The flash fried brussel sprouts are my favorite. I'd also recommend the vermicelli with white wine garlic sauce. For lunch, they offer this \"pick a pair\" combo, where you can pick from salads, soups or half a sandwich. It ends up being a really filling meal. Walnut grill hasn't failed to consistently provide a satisfactory experience on different occasions whether with friends, colleagues or on a date, but it's been just that - satisfactory. I haven't yet had my mind blown with any aspect of the experience, whether something I've eaten or something else. I also don't think their menu has changed in the past couple of years. It's just that I like this place.. but I think I've gotten bored with it.",

We sat down at 7:45, and salad, soup, bread, and main courses were on the table by 8:05. I personally hate when your eating your salad and your main course shows up. Give me a second to digest. I ordered soup, my wife, salad. Neither of us were close to finished and we are fast eaters. Do I let my main course cool? Do I leave my soup unfinished?

    "text": "Stopped in for dinner this Friday evening. The restaurant was busy as there was a nhl playoff game on. Upon arriving, we waited for two hostesses to finish their conversation before noticing us. We were told (or more accurately shown with a waving hand) that the bar area was open seating. After sitting at a table, we watched 15 minutes of the game before being approached by a server. The wine my girlfriend ordered was not available due to an upcoming menu update. I ordered a domestic draft. Another 10-15 minutes passed and the server came back to inform me they were out if the beer.   We then ordered our food. My girlfriend got a strawberry salad which was fine, I ordered the chicken spiedini and was told they were also out of this due to the menu update. The server quickly offered to actually check the availability of the item and I offered a back up selection.  The dish was well prepared when I received it.  Throughout the evening we experienced 20-30 minute gaps between our server stopping at the table. The only factor which made this passable was the game on the tv's.   Overall, the food was good when we did eventually receive it but the overall experience was horrid. Our server was very nice and helpful, but she appeared to be the only server working a crowded bar area during a home team championship game on a beautiful Friday evening. If the restaurant is planning a menu change, they may want to transition their meals more efficiently to avoid large amounts of the current menu not being available.  The preparedness of having one of the most popular domestic drafts out of stock 10 minutes into a game night is laughable as well. Simply one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have ever had, the only positive was our servers ability to remain upbeat despite the hurdles she was forced to overcome.",

    "text": "One thing I've come to appreciate about localized restaurant chains like Walnut Grill is that they provide a reviewer like myself a chance to try various items on their menu by going to different franchises, thereby (hee hee) racking up more Yelp reviews. I kid. Partly.   For example, I'd been to Mount Lebanon's Walnut Grill a few times and had been meaning to try their burger, but honestly,  I generally don't like to go back to the same places over and over again. So, when I learned that a Walnut Grill had recently opened in Bridgeville, it gave me an excuse to get Kay-- who'd just returned home from a cruise-- to take a ride over with me. After all, it was my birthday, and as per tradition, she was treating.  All I wanted for my natal night meal was a fantastic burger, and WG's Classic Cheeseburger was a wish from a blown-out candle come True. Living up to its name, the patty's luscious, sophisticated, well-seasoned, freshly ground chuck/steak blend (I tasted some sirloin and perhaps ribeye)  had an ideal char on the exterior and an equally optimal mid-rare (as requested) interior. Lettuce and tomato were par for the course, but my choice of gouda (I seem to be going with that a lot of late) added a bit of twang and creamy mouthfeel. The almost artisanal bun was elegantly molded and had a texture and buttery flavor that was nearly akin to a croissant yet was surprisingly sturdy and absorbent. The fries that came with the burger were nearly flawless as well, approaching The Original Hot Dog Shop's crisp-meets-fluffy watermark but with a seasoning that vaguely smacked of Old Bay.   Our appetizer was a bit trendier as well as more gourmet and less conventional, WG's Chicken & Brie Quesadilla proving my theory that tapas are often the most interesting dishes on any given bill of fare. Drizzled with a tart raspberry puree (I'm thinking of a certain Prince ditty from the 80's right now), the insides of the floury tortilla barely contained that nuttiest, lardiest, lustiest of cheeses as it attempted to ooze itself all over the plate and onto our fingers. Halved grapes were a uniquely sweet, crunchy, juicy twist and complimented the perfectly supple grilled chicken breast. Sour cream reined in the cilantro as best it could but not without allowing that ornery, controversial herb to make its aromatic presence known. With some kettle chips, this would make for a nice, light picnic lunch on its own. A thimble of watery salsa was also included, but sadly, it was neglected entirely.  For dessert it was the dance-hard-or-die ethos of the aptly named Chocolate Decadence Cake. Calling it \"cake\" is a misnomer as far as I am concerned. Place a piece of kitchen tissue underneath it, and stick it in a candy store's glass case, 'cause this was a thwacking wedge of absolutely malicious fudge with a star of chocolate syrup marking the middle of the plate like a pentagram scrawled in the dirt during an occult ritual in a forest. A tuft of whipped cream and a cold, wet strawberry shivered on the sidelines acting as frightened bystanders to a spectacle of purely evil confection. Mildly smoky and thicker and more saccharine than a shoofly pie, the cotter of cocoa also possessed a subtle brimstone bitterness to it that haunted my palate for hours to come.   Suburbanites have welcomed Walnut Grill's New American swing into their community if the overflowing attendance during our visit was evidence of anything. Patrons laughed and wholesomely blew off work-week steam as they noshed on nimbly prepared food in environs that were at once homey, sports bar-ish, and discotheque-like without being exclusionary. Single, middle-aged people mingled with each other while families with small children enjoyed themselves comfortably and gaggles of twenty-something colleagues gossiped about office politics. A large group celebrating an anniversary dined across from us as a mother and her adult daughter were able to have a deep conversation over a serving of hummus. No matter which trail you take on the walk of life, Walnut Grill has a booth, stool, or table for you.  P.S. This Walnut Grill has live music and trivia nights. Check their Facebook page.   P.P.S. The service was exceptional in every way.   P.P.P.S. I believe Walnut Grill's menu still varies slightly depending on location, but I have not been to all of them yet.",

The mashed potatoes and carrots were good.  My girlfriend had the chicken alfredo over pasta. She said the alfredo was ok but the pasta was overcooked and starchy.

The place was not busy and we sat in the bar (party of three, sat in a booth)  The waiter was in SLIW MOTION  we ordered drinks and then watched him wander around before calling him over to take our order.  When our drinks were empty we called him over twice before he placed our drink order at the bar. We saw the drinks sitting there but no Bobby.  Two other wait staff came out with our meals and had to ask Booby which table to serve.  We asked them to grab our drinks from the bar.  So, not sure we will go back let alone take our out of town guests for poor service and food that was just ok, not great.  Giving one star because fewer was not an option.",

We sat on the heated patio - which I'm actually grateful for since the \"inside\" restaurant seemed a little loud. You still get the atmosphere on the patio, but being able to visit with everyone at the table was nice.  We ate here on a Saturday, and it's really nice they still do a happy hour on the weekend. 5-7 is $3 drafts, $3 house wine and $5 Long Island Iced Teas. The drafts even include some craft options which was very nice!   The menu itself had so many unique items on it, it was hard to choose from. The meat and pasta entrees on average ranges from $15-$20 so i was a little tempted to choose a sandwich since that was a little cheaper (parents were paying and I always feel bad getting something on the pricier side) but I just had to try the Thai Pork Mac n' Cheese. It was delicious! Don't be fooled by the mac n' cheese title though - it's much more of an alfredo pasta dish. So delicious. I was full but kept eating because it was so good.  Everyone at the table was very happy with their food - some other dishes people got were the sweet & spicy chicken, fish tacos, gnocchi, greek pasta and sun-dried tomato pasta . The service is also super nice and helpful.",

Would definitely recommend you consider this restaurant for a private gathering.",

I'm sure that's the go-to for his life problems, deserts. Do not patron this location. Excuse making joke in charge trickles down to garbage experience.",

It is pretty big about 8 slices and is covered in a creamy spinach artichoke dip, topped with lots of mozzarella and provolone, and bits of chicken. If you love spinach artichoke dip, then this flatbread is calling your name. Have also had the vegetarian flatbread, which was nothing special. Typically get this for take out and am always satisfied.",

We were greeted with a friendly face and seated promptly in the lounge area as it was available.  Our server promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  We placed a cocktail order which IMO took a bit longer than it should the bartender seemed to have enough time to hold several conversations around the bar.  Our waitress returned with our drinks and proceeded to take our food order.  We ordered an appetizer of the pork nachos which were very good.  Also she took our food order.  Our appetizer took IMO a bit longer than it should .  Our app was brought by a nice girl from the kitchen.  Within 1 minute our dinner arrived (same girl).  As she approached she realized she just brought the app.  She looked like a deer in the headlights.  She said she could take our meals back and out them under the warmer if we liked.  We opted to keep them and try to enjoy the rest of our meal.  I had ordered the pork tenderloin cooked medium.  Upon cutting in to the 1st if 2 pieces found it more like Med rare.  The second was nearly raw!  I motioned the server and explained my issue and was told she would take back.  A few minutes later my plate was returned with the same piece that I cut into which was merely tossed under the broiler.  You would think a manager would have stopped by to apologize but that did not happen!  I'm not one to complain but i am one to warn others stay away!  The food all tasted good other but the missteps by the staff were not worth it!",

The crabcakes were delicious, my fiance had an out of this world steak, and my MIL had the balsamic chicken, which is my new favorite dish. The atmosphere was very friendly and the waitstaff was super attentive. They do have certain specials on different nights, and we happened to get the $15 bottle of wine night. Being it seems as though they switch up their wine selection, that is the only thing that the waitress wasn't 100% sure about, but she checked on our questions before bringing our bottle out.  As for the private space, there is a large back room that will fit a very large group of people. It can also be split into two separate rooms which is a very nice feature for smaller groups. One of the rooms has access to the outside patio and we have been told that by the summertime they may even be offering live music outside.  All in all, this place has a great vibe. It is modern without being over the top and the food was phenomenal. Not knowing all of the restaurants in our area, it had been extremely hard booking a rehearsal that everyone would like that would also have a relaxed vibe and would also be under $40 per person. After eating at Walnut Grill, the choice was an absolute no-brainer.",

The server brought our bread after most of us were finished with our meals which was unfortunate.  My crab cake dinner was $24 which is a little pricey for Bridgeville and the portion size.  My total bill was $54 before my 20% tip.  While we were signing our bills the manager walked over and asked us to leave. He said he was just trying to make everyone happy.  He offered us free drinks at the bar which we declined.  This was an uncomfortable ending to our visit to the Walnut Grill.  I could understand if we ordered waters with lemons and side salads.  However, we all ordered drinks (except one friend who ordered lemonade) and two of my friends ordered dessert on top of our meals!  Strangely, we never saw anyone waiting for a table when we left!  So thanks but no thanks!  We are a group of professionals and stay at home mothers who will not be returning to this estsblishment!",

Again, we eat out regularly and have experienced nightmares going to new restaurants.  This was a minor issue for us since they were extremely busy.  I gave them 5 stars based on what they accomplished in a short period of time.  The food and table service are worth the wait, but make make reservations on weekends to avoid longer waits.",

For my main course I ordered the California turkey wrap with sweet potato fries. The wrap came out with all the wrong ingredients on it. The \"fries\" were literally a sweet potato sliced in quarters. Because we had already been there for some time, I asked for it just to be taken off the check and taken away.

    "text": "We arrived on a Sunday around noon for lunch and the restaurant was at about 25% capacity.  We asked to sit outside and were informed the only outside seats were on the patio with no shade.  We agreed to sit there even though the sun was bright today, not expecting to be waiting 1.5+ hours for our food service.  After ordering our drinks, we waited up to an hour for our food.  We noticed the patrons around us receiving gift cards because the \"kitchen was so behind today\".  Our server offered us a punch card for breakfast/lunch where we would each purchase another lunch then be able to receive a free meal. Ok, not great but nice gesture.   The food here is not fresh and mostly it is a bar type menu with fatty foods.  I ordered the \"chicken and artichoke\" sandwich which was basically spinach and artichoke dip on a flatbread.  There was oil pooling on the \"sandwich\".  It was listed as grilled chicken with spinach, tomato, artichoke and asiago atop pita bread.  I was not expected to have spinach and artichoke dip slapped on a flatbread.  Gross.  After waiting an hour for our food, we finally ate, and my fiance asked for one more beer.  It took 20 minutes to actually get our beer and then another 20 minutes to get our bill cashed out.  This was not because the kitchen was \"going through some changes\" as we were told, it was just plain poor service.  We eventually moved from the patio to the outside bar area.  While there, a group of people walked in with a small dog (not a service dog) and took the dog right up to the bar.  The bartender went out to pet the dog, which is clearly a health code violation.  This dog shouldn't be so close to the food service area.  Obviously if they allow dogs right at the bar, there are likely many other health code violations that we aren't even aware of!  According to the Allegheny Couny Health Department: 326.6 Animals A. Live animals shall be excluded from within the food facility operational areas and from immediately adjacent areas.  C. Animals accompanying physically challenged persons shall be permitted in customer areas. Patrol dogs accompanying security or police officers shall be permitted in offices, storage areas and the outside premises.  D. While on duty, persons employed in the food operational areas of a facility shall not care for or handle any animals.",

    "text": "We visited at 5:30 on a Sunday. It took 50 minutes to get food. When our food finally arrived, the Parmesan crusted gnocchi that we ordered showed up as Parmesan crusted chicken on a bed of pasta. As the plate was being served, the waitress says apparently we are out of gnocchi and that wasn't on our 86 board. Here's the problem, pasta IS NOT an acceptable automatic substitution for gnocchi and therefore, we should have been notified before the plate arrived at the table. We absolutely should been notified prior and. given the opportunity to charge the order, which we would have done. If I order a mixed green salad, you can't just give me a Caesar salad because they are both called salad. At this point, sending it back and waiting another exorbitant amount of time for a new entree just wasn't a feasible option, so we ended up eating something we didn't want...and paying $18.00 for it.  To top it off, the French Onion soup was so salty, I couldn't finish it.",

For example, he took our glasses to refill them and forgot to return them. Other staff worked hard to avoid eye contact. Vegetables and fruits were wilted, brown, and/or had freezer burn. Confusing to me how food in such bad shape could be sent out of the kitchen. One person's entree had hot spots and dried out parts, making us think it had been microwaved. We used to like this restaurant, but something has changed. Now I wish we had chosen to eat at the Moe's next door, where at least the food would have been fresh.",

The service was good at the bar and liked that they had a special even though it wasn't happy hour ($4.00 Long Island).  I ordered to go \"Chef Randy's Gyro\".  I got home and opened up the bag and was really surprised.. this wasn't your typical 'to go\" quality or portion size.  It was amazing.  The gyro was fresh and bursting with flavor and there was no shortage of fries.    Looking to my next visit.  Cheers",

After an hour, sitting around the fire place, seeing 6 tables (4 seat tables) open, I had to go back to the hostess and inquire. He said, no tables were available for 6, as he was sitting a table for 4. I asked why he could not put 2 tables together. He then agreed. We finally had a table, but no server. Thank goodness for our favorite waiter/bartender, Robert P. He asked if we were ok, and what he could do to help. As always, he was amazing. Saved the day. We will come back for the service of such. Thank you Robert!",

    "text": "Walnut Grill- An over-priced and under-serviced eatery in Pittsburgh.  I came here with two friends a few weeks ago when I came back to Pittsburgh for a visit.  Walnut Grill looked like they had a decent menu, and the vibe looked cool.  We came in around 8:00 on a Friday night and were immediately seated.  Our server was nice and kept the drinks full, but that was the high point of the meal.  The one food item that we ordered and really enjoyed was the Pulled Pork Nachos ($14).  It easily fed three people, and the sweet sauce and toppings were unique and delicious.  I wish I had just gotten the nachos, as did the rest of my party.  Our table also ordered the Salmon BLT ($14), Beer-Battered Cod ($13), and I ordered the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken and Gnocchi ($18).  My meal was passable, but my friends ate less than two bites of theirs.  The meals were just not very good.  The lowest point was the service as it got later.  Our meals took a while to be prepared by the kitchen so we were one of the last people in the dining room.  Once our plates were cleared, one of the servers turned out the lights in the dining room and walked out.  First, if you wanted to leave that quickly, at least ask us to move our seats to the bar.  Second, maybe you should admit that if your kitchen is slow, you should not be additionally rude to the patrons.  Overall, I was not impressed and would not recommend Walnut Grill.  Leave the suburbs for dinner or look for a local and better casual sit down place, like Mad Mex.",

    "text": "Last night we tried to go to Walnut Grill on Washington Pike. There was a warning from the Allegheny County Health Department on the door. I asked the hostess what it was about. She said that they were sighted for too much heat in the kitchen for employees. This didn't make much sense to me. The manager came over and said the same thing. I had my smartphone with me and did a quick search on line. An article from the Post Gazette showed three violations, none of which matched what we were told. Some sounded serious to me. I shared what I found with the manager. She insisted that the PG article was in error. So I went to the health department website and found that it pretty much matched the Post Gazette word for word. We were seated and they sent the chef over to further explain the violations. His explanation, while more detailed, did not make sense to me. I was able to convince the rest of my party to go elsewhere for the evening. By then the staff had totally lost credibility.  We like Walnut Grill, but this experience has shaken my confidence.  I'm sure we will try them again, after their problems have been corrected and the health advisory has been lifted. We had been going there nearly once per week, so we did like their food. I just wish they had been more direct and honest about their problems. A quick update: The health advisory has been lifted. It still doesn't forgive lying about the reason for it, in my opinion.",

We got happy hour which was 3 dollar drafts , so we had a few. We picked tuna, stuffed peppers, tots, and boneless wings to eat. Everything was so good!

We both had the pick a pairs I had shrimp pasta and a strawberry salad, it was good. It was a little bland but with some hot sauce, it was good.  Our server was good and  as very nice.

I can say staff was friendly and I enjoyed my loaded baked potato, but my main entree, the Parmesan crusted chicken and gnocci, was lack luster. The sauce was kind of bland and the chicken tasted fairly plain. Also, as we received our food, all three of us had our dinner come up at the same time, but our fourth friend did not receive hers until about 5-10 min later, and this went unnoticed for a very long time until we were able to alert the waitress. Food is a bit overpriced and as they do have decent happy hour deals here and there, I can't say I've had an experience that makes me want to come back for more unfortunately.",

Upon entering, the restaurant smells like dirty mop water/dirty drains (I've worked in restaurants before and recognize the smell) Our server was friendly and attentive, so that wasn't the issue at all. Our appetizer and my meal were fine, nothing special but OK. My husbands however was horrible, he got the mixed grill. Everything had lots of black grill residue on it and all you could taste was the charred grill taste, no other flavor. It was apparent that everything had been cooked on a grill that hadn't been cleaned in a while. We were swatting fruit flies away the entire time we were sitting there. Final straw on the way out was no paper towels or dyers in the ladies room & walked out with dripping wet hands. I feel like there are many easy fixes that could be made to improve the quality of this place.",

I had the California turkey wrap. I thought it was really good! It had candied bacon, honey mustard and goat cheese (which I love!). Our waitress was very nice, however, she seemed to be focused on the fact that it was busy and I felt that she had her mind on other things. While taking my friend's order, another customer asked if they were to pay up front or wait for her, and in mid order she apologized and left to get the other woman's check. We just found it odd since only one person out of the 4 of us had given our order. Then, someone else brought out our food but completely forgot my friend's salad. It was about 5 minutes that our waitress came back and we told her that her food was missing. Overall, I was pleased with my meal but probably wouldn't go back during such a busy time.",

After waiting for some time without any server, not even a glass of water we left. Owners need to take a good look at what the heck is going on at this location!!",

I recently had a group of 25-30 people and had reserved the side porch - everyone arrived around 6:00 - this was a weekday and the place was not crowded - the three hostesses were able to stand at the booth.  We had a very nice waitress - unfortunately she was relatively new and didn't know how to do separate checks . She also didn't ask for help from her manager and her manager didn't offer her help. The waitress left it up to me to separate the checks - and then our table sat uncleared for over 40 minutes with my friends paid check receipts and cash on them. The manager did apologize and gave me a gift card but the overall experience was not great - as an aside the bathrooms were dirty.",

The food was good, the atmosphere was great, the wait staff were very friendly and welcoming but the draft beer choices left a lot to be desired.   There are many good beers that can be ordered even local breweries but the beer menu showed little attention or a person who either never tries them or just doesn't care.  Why not a Bells, Alpine, Southern Tier, Fat Heads, Troegs and many others but Sam Adams cold snap, Sierra Nevada really doesn't cut it.",

I was served by Mike who is super friendly and attentive and alwaya gives the best scoop on what to order. Food always comes fast without any issues and Mike always provides excellent customer service. The atmosphere is super clean and nuanced and gives you the feeling of a nice romantic atmosphere if you are trying to impress a first date.   I highly recommend getting one of their super affordable bowls including the ahi tuna bowl, korean BBQ salmon bowl or their new superfood bowl. Of the following, I like to stick with my gut and get my ahi tuna which has the best quality tuna available nicely balanced with mango salsa, watermellon radish, roasted beets, avocado, wasabi notes and cilantro. This ultra flavorful tuna bowl will be sure to satisfy your cravings",

    "text": "Unless you're sitting at the bar, the service is a complete bust.  If the host/hostess isn't at the stand when you walk in, get ready for a wait. They're in no particular hurry.  More often than not, the server will disappear for 20+ minutes at a time, usually when you're looking for your check. We often have to ask a different server to find ours because they vanished after bringing the meal out.  Around half of our visits have been impacted by the kitchen being \"a little backed up.\" I don't know what's going on to make this such a repeat problem but it happens often enough to be a bad sign. A DoorDash delivery even had to wait by the hostess stand for over half an hour just to grab two salads that didn't even include any dressing.  This is really a shame, because the food is generally quite good, with great portions and flavor. We've only had to send a dish back once, and that was because the pork came out raw beyond safe conditions. We actually had to send that back twice though we were told it's cooked to \"chef medium.\" No dude, that's called trichinosis. You can't serve thick cut medallions of pork that's only been seared.  I think that was an isolated incident because the food has otherwise always been on point (tip: ask for your salad dressing on the side because it will be soaked in it otherwise.)  If you get a chance to sit at the bar, go for it. Service will be on point, the drinks will keep flowing, and you stand a better chance of walking away happy.",

    "text": "Walnut Grill and I just do not get along. I remember not being overly enamored with their other South Hills location years ago. Somehow my visit to their Bridgeville eatery was even less impressive.  I joined a group of people for dinner here a few weeks back. I was admittedly later than the rest of the group, but that's OK - I wasn't in a rush and didn't expect to get anything I ordered at the same time as anyone else. So I settled in, ordered a drink, and got some tacos (it was Tuesday, after all!).  I did get the drink relatively quickly, but those tacos did not show up until something like fifty minutes later...after we asked the waiter where they were. Why wait so long to ask, you say? Our waiter just disappeared for a while. We even looked around the general area for him at one point since we needed refills - no luck.  The rest of the group commented that he had been much more attentive when they were initially seated, so who knows what happened there. All I do know is that the night went from smooth and quick to slooooooooow. It took a while to get refills; to get those tacos I ordered; to get our checks...you get the idea. By the way, the restaurant was fairly empty during this adventure in slow dining.  I will say, my drink and tacos were quite good. I like a strong tasty drink, and the tacos did come out hot and fresh. Yay! But I still left wondering, \"If that's the service on a slow night, who knows what it's like on a busy night?\" I admittedly don't plan on returning to find out; I can pay less for more food and a guaranteed better experience.",

The only problem I ever have is their menu is so extensive and offers such a wide variety that I have a hard time choosing what I want!  The chicken & artichoke sandwich (served open-face on a pita) is my go-to. In addition to a wide food menu, they also have an equally extensive drink menu - everything from beer and wine to martinis and Moscow mules. The strawberry-Bellini-tini is absolutely delicious if you're looking for a fancy drink to enjoy. It's not overly sweet and goes down too smooth (so be careful haha).   They also have a great happy hour from 5-7 PM, but it's only available if you sit in the bar area. There are nightly drink specials for the restaurant area though, too. Also, if you're a veteran or teacher there are certain days where they offer a discount or BOGO!",

Walnut Grill has a nice variety of breakfast/brunch options, so everyone in your party should be able to find something they like! I went with the DubG's lil plate and it came with two eggs, choice of breakfast meat, breakfast potatoes, and choice of toast. I also ordered a side of French toast because I had a taste for something sweet also!   Our food came out quickly and everything looked delicious! Sidenote- I ordered the bacon as my breakfast meat and it was thick cut, crispy pieces of heaven.. I could have eaten a whole plate of just that! And my side of french toast was two large pieces cut into four triangles. I had to take half of it home!  But overall, our waitress (Augusta) was awesome- she kept coming back to make sure our coffees and waters were full and the food was really good too! I would definitely come back here for breakfast!",

    "text": "What a dismissive place!  Our convention was being held that weekend.  We were on our own for dinner where Walnut Grill was a recommended spot for us to go.  Now there were 30 of us but the restaurant was not busy maybe 25% so we were a good ticket for the night as one would think.  It took them 1 hour to get to us to order.  We sat so long waiting it was ridiculous as we were wondering \"when\".  Our waitress took our drink orders but was slow there like I got my glass of wine, but water I had to ask 4 times.  We got bread after 1/2 hour.  We were 3 large tables.    What's sad is that the food was good.  I had the short ribs with a Caesar salad (upcharged), veggies and baked potato.  From what I saw from others' plates, their food was good.  Yet some others had to wait or didn't get what they ordered.  We had 1 1/2 year old and they didn't think she'd want food when an order was put in as she was the last to be served as we had to ask to feed the baby!  We were lucky as she was an incredible well behaved baby as that length of time could have led to a melt down.    When it came time for the check, we asked if they would offer an accommodation or some sort given what we went through as it was now 8:30 PM as we arrived 6:30 PM.  The manager said that length did not justify any accommodation.  Insult to injury - we got our checks as the restaurant was nice to do separate checks, but then they just plopped them on the table for us to sort and again when it was signature time.    I accept the fact that large parties are auto charged gratuity but the percentage should be based on what that party purchased.  They applied an across the board $4.98.  This meant someone who ordered a lot didn't pay an appropriate 18% and someone who ate light pad a percentage of up to 25% as one party just had a salad and water.    Such an unfortunate experience and to be dismissed like that for how we were treated.",

The server was no where to be found most of the evening. Never were we asked if we needed anything when our food was brought out. When i did ask for something, the food runner said they would \"look and see and will be right back\". They never came back. Resulting in me getting up to go to the bar to simply ask for my request. The amount of unprofessionalism with the servers and runners and hostess is astounding. I'm not one to be irritated when going to a restaurant as i am with this one. I've worked in the food industry and hospitality industry for years, this is an absolute embarrassment to the Walnut Grill chain. Better management is needed here.",

They came out with half the components listed on the menu missing and ringed by stale tortilla chips. Asked bartender, who had not checked on us, to have kitchen refire dish as described in menu. Wished I hadn't. Over easy eggs were underdone so the whites were snotty. Dish was now missing peppers, and topped with a guac so brown it could have been beef stew. Sausage was greasy crumbs. For the price this dish was actually offensive. Won't be back.",

Our server was attentive and bubbly, helpful and heavy handed with the coffee!  I ordered the Country Breakfast Bowl with the eggs scrambled - the ham wasn't overly salted, it was a skillet and the sausage gravy was served in a bowl on the side (I couldn't finish it all, but I didn't mind).  My friend got the chicken and waffles and was very pleased - there were lots of flavors involved, mainly because of the candied jalapenos and chipotle orange maple syrup.   At $11.99 and $12.99 I thought the prices were reasonable & I would definitely return!",

My fiance and I decided to eat here on a whim, as I wanted their French onion soup terribly. When we were finally served (about half an hour after we ordered), the French onion soup was luke warm at best and EXTREMELY salty. I am not one to complain about food at all, but I couldn't even stomach to swallow it. About 20 minutes after they told me they would fix it, another server came back to my table and said, \"it would all be from the same batch so here's stew.\" It's not that I wasn't appreciative that she tried to replace it, but I do not like stew. I would have much rather had a salad at that point, but that was never even offered as an option. Ultimately, the situation was never rectified, which is the reason for my dismay. Service was extremely slow and food was subpar at best.",

We had a few selections on a personalized menu to choose from, and the food was good and came out very quickly after everyone ordered. For a very reasonable fee they also cut and served our cake. The waiters were extremely nice and efficient and took care of the many drink orders throughout the night quickly. We left behind balloons and other decor and they told us they would take care of it. We stayed about 20 minutes past closing and we were never rushed out of there. I would definitely host an event here again. Thank you!!",

Started with onion soup  (great flavor but was  topped with lump of mozzarella cheese, awkward to enjoy) & also did chicken  quesoadilla. Huge portion as an app (plan to share! ) and is tasty but not great,  not a typical quesoadilla. For mains had the red snapper (ok but salsa way too spicy) and crab stuffed flounder  (crab stuffing  good but fish way over cooked.)  I had ordered the flounder & instead of usual sides requested  a small salad and veg special  (grilled asparagus.) Server nice but fussed, said asparagus would  be extra  $2.  Duh? Gee ok, fine...that's  what I'd like.  What  was very upsetting is when my entree arrived I was given a plate with the flounder, a baked sweet potato and something that looked  (and tasted ) like lawn clippings. Server said sorry, forgot the asparagus but can put that order in,will take  5 min.  I asked her to not bother,please  make sure we weren't charged. Upsetting because she didn't  offer  to correct my order  even when she noticed it was totally wrong &  darn,  never  got my salad!  Overall, very dissapointed  in the service & food. Have had good there in the past but do not plan to return.",

The staff was very upbeat & friendly but, as my coworker put it, they have some kinks to still work out.  Shortly after we were seated, we had two different servers attempt to take our drink order.  There seemed to be some confusion over who was supposed to be handling our table.  After it was figured out, I ordered the flat bread chicken sandwich.  The flat bread was burned rather badly on the edges and underside.  Also it really did not resemble much of a \"sandwich\", it was more or less just piled on to the plate.  I was also told I'd have a refill as soon as the iced tea was done brewing but it never happened.    On the upside, the sweet potato fries were very good and my coworker's burger also looked very appetizing.  If you do visit, I would suggest trying to get seated in the bar area as it looked very open with a lot of natural lighting but would recommend you avoid the flat bread chicken sandwich.",

All of the other bartenders were on the ball as well, making sure we were never in need of anything. The food was out of this world. Major props to this business for being on the ball right out of the gates. We will definately be back!!",

    "text": "My review does not stem from the service or the food.  They were certainly adequate.  However, after settling the bill $17.66, and leaving, I checked my bank account on my phone and found they had charged me $17.66 and $82.66. (My Bill was for $17.66)  When I called the restaurant, TAD the manager could not have been more rude or arrogant. . I was told he didn't see it on his end so it wasn't True.  After nearly 30 minutes on the phone arguing my point, he found out through a call to his credit card company, I was indeed charged both of these amounts.  Upon checking with the server, he told TAD that he charged another person's bill to my card.  This was a debit account and these fund were missing from my checking account for nearly three day.  As a courtesy, TAD was to send me a gift card. This was on Tuesday, as of Saturday still no gift card. And again, the arrogance of TAD \"well I don't know, I put it in the mail must be the post office's fault\" was his reply. Seriously, there are many respected establishment in our city where you do NOT have to go through this type of inconvenience.  Reputable, restaurants who would not argue with you for 30 minutes, but would check, apologize, and make thing right.  Very disappointed in the very poor management of an otherwise nice restaurant .",

I suggested Walnut Grill.  We were seated around 8:00 PM and with very little interaction from our server, our meal finally arrived around 9:15.  We both ordered the filet mignon and it was not worth the wait.  It was flavorless and not prepared as requested.  The server was apathetic at best.  Honestly, we both agreed that we have had better at Outback. It was a strange experience.  We were the only customers seated in the one section and it felt like we were forgotten about.  Our server was one of the least engaged I've ever had.  I wont be going back.  There are way too many other decent restaurants to visit.",

Not one employee seemed concerned that I was sitting there with no food and was never even offered bread.  I finally asked to pay for my beer and ended up leaving without eating.   I shall never return to the Walnut Grille. I asked for the manager and after another five minutes he came over.  We spoke, he offered to buy my meal and I passed, he offered to buy my next meal and I passed.  I ended up leaving without eating and will not return.  Stopped at Sonic drive thru on way home and had my dinner in the car.  At least the food was hot and quick and the drink was cold.",

    "text": "There's a reason that the other local Walnut Grill's have closed and based on my recent experience, I firmly believe this one is on the fast-track to follow suit.  First, it must be disclosed that on Mother's Day 2016, our party of six did not have a reservation.  With that said, our decision to visit the Walnut Grill was based upon an earlier phone call which confirmed the wait would be no more than one hour.  This was acceptable given the circumstances, and would give our party a chance to meet at the bar for cocktails anyway.  Upon arrival to a near-dead-empty restaurant, we were advised by the hostess that the wait would be 3 hours, unless we wanted to eat outside.  We saw that the patio (also empty as it was 60 degrees and falling) was equipped with heat lamps, so we opted to sit outside.  The hostess advised that we could simply let her know when we were ready to be seated after our cocktails at the bar, which we did approximately 30 minutes later.  The hostess then led us to a table on a different patio at the opposite side of the building near the front parking lot.  This patio offered no space heaters.  Despite these setbacks, we decided to stick it out and make the best of the situation, after all, we made it to a table at a restaurant on Mother's Day without reservations.  It's worth mentioning that we could see countless tables inside the restaurant that remained vacant throughout the duration of our visit.  After a brief wait, our waitress arrived with menus.  We spent about 15 minutes perusing the \"special\" Mother's Day Menu, which is different and dissimilar to the traditional Walnut Grill menu.  The waitress arrived and took our orders: 2 cedar-planked salmon and 4 NY strip steaks.  Approximately 20 minutes later, the waitress returned with a basket of bread, which she set on the table and again disappeared.  We had no place settings or plates so we were forced to wait for her return to ask for these items.  When we did, she brought 4 plates and 2 place settings while at the same time advising us that the kitchen had run out of NY strip steaks.  Disappointed, we all chose the next-most similar (but more expensive) menu item, the filet.  The waitress disappeared again, this time for around 45 minutes.  When she finally re-emerged, we politely asked how much longer we could expect to wait, especially for the soup that was ordered (over 1 hour ago).  She lazily advised that the wait would be at least 20 more minutes and that the soup for some bizarre unknown reason, would arrive with the entrees.  How she came up with the 20 minute estimation is anyone's guess.  At this point, we decided to re-evaluate our options and considered leaving, but believed we were close enough to the finish line that we opted to stay.  20 more long minutes later, our meals finally arrived, which in this case one would think would be a blessing.  I can only speak to the quality of my own meal, but will attest that nobody appeared overly excited about the food on their plates.  Unfortunately, my filet was cooked \"medium\", as was the preference when the original NY strip steak was ordered- my fault, I guess for not re-specifying, but nonetheless it was a bland slab of meat.  Nothing special about the baked potato or garden slaw.  Word about our table's long wait and unrest must have made its way to the restaurant's manager, as he arrived at our table to offer an apology- and a price reduction on our bill- a nice gesture, for which most of us were appreciative, but which was too little, too late.  This restaurant is a total mess- from the awkward, separationist floorplan to the bartenders' avoidance-of-eye contact policy to the trash-strewn restrooms- just an overall pretty terrible experience.  Not sure how long this place can last in it's state of mismanagement.  The waitress who served us was unacceptably untrained, which is a disappointment at a restaurant asking $26-38 per entree.  In my opinion, Walnut Grill has attemped to position itself as an \"up-market\" restaurant without first taking care of the small details that are to be expected of comparable restaurants.  No place of business can operate in the manner which the Walnut Grill does and expect to stay in business long. I predict this restaurant will be closed in the very near, if not immediate future.  Will not go back.",

She eventually brought our food 15 minutes later and the ice cream 5 min later. Then I asked for a couple boxes. Apparently she thought we were done with our app and kids food because she took it away. I was going to box it up. She said the kitchen could remake it but that probably would have required another 35 min wait. We complained to the manager and they didn't seem to care. No apology at all. Food was only decent.
