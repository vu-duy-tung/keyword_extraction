Nope, I was wrong...The beer selection was outstanding and the food was good. Everything from the homemade potato chips to the fish sandwich. I got the large fish and it was 1 pound of meat on a nice size bun. I was so full that I never got a chance to taste the pizza, however next time that will be my plan.   I would go here again no doubt! The prices were very inexpensive too....but expected at this place.",

The pizza is excellent, as is the tuna melt and meatball sub (if you're cutting out the breads, have them do the \"bunless\" meatball sub - meatballs baked in a little crock with melted cheese....yummy!). If you like bread, get the homemade breadsticks.  Delish!  I wish there was a little more in the way of variety for lunch specials, but I never leave hungry, and the staff is super friendly!",

The stains on my shirts and dough around my mid-section are physical proof that I'm pizza passionate.  Frankly, I've found the pizza in Pittsburgh plentiful in quantity but rather spotty on quality.  Last night we went to Bee'z for the first time.  It's a little outside our neighborhood.  Wow.  My wife and I, 12-year old daughter, 15-year old son and two of his pals shared a large veggie white pizza and large Rajun Cajun chicken.  Fantastic.  The crust was flavorful and fresh, the toppings were plentiful and consistent.  Service was great (an rarity in the 'burgh IMHO).  We got the pizzas quickly, shortly after we polished off a zuchinni plank starter (also quite good).  The total bill (with a couple Yinglings) and water for everyone was slightly over $40.  I'm looking forward to going back, trying some of their other pies, and see if this was a fluke or I've found my new favorite pizza place.",

I asked the waitress that was running around if we could have a table and she rudely told us to seat ourselves as she passed by. We found the table with the least amount of stuff on it and waited and waited for her to serve us. Finally my boyfriend went to the bar to order our drinks and the bartender told us she couldn't serve us only the waitress could. We sat waiting for her to finally come over and take our drinks. Tried ordering 3 different beers off their wall menu none of which were available. Ended up getting the most simple drinks and waited 10 more minutes for her to bring them as they sat on the bar. Terrible service, rude waitress and bartender, won't be giving them anymore of my business when there are plenty of other bars in Bridgeville.",

Great Shrimp and Avocado Wrap and really good salads!  When our office ordered take out last month and I ordered a Salmon Burger.  It was definitely better than expected.  Very flavorful and nice portion.  I actually did away with the bun and ate the salmon.  Then last week my husband and I went and I ordered the Greek Salmon, recommended by the waitress, she doesn't eat fish, but said it is a popular choice among regulars.  It did not disappoint.  It was so good.  It really does rival any of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.  My husband ordered French onion soup a bacon burger.  His soup was good but he said the burger tasted like a frozen burger and didn't care for two patties on a hoagie bun, he would have preferred a fresh made burger on a hamburger bun. Funny that they make a better piece of Salmon then a Burger!  Service is standard.  They seemed overworked and short staffed.  They don't smile a lot.  But since this is a food review - definitely try the Salmon!  That's why I gave it 4 stars!",

They have the restaurant one side and the pub on the other separated by a door. All the servers and hosts are very kind and friendly.  Now for the food: Their chicken wings are amazing - always fresh, warm and juicy. Their salads are huge and always have fresh ingredients. Pizzas are very popular and I can see why the few times I've tried a pizza. The sandwiches and chef's choices are also very good. Never have I walked out of Beez disappointed. I am always stuffed and smiling. If you are in the South Hills area and in the mood for some home cooked style American food, this is the place to go.",

    "text": "Although I have lived in the area for more than twelve years, this was my first visit to Bee'z Bistro.  This is an attractive, modern, comfortable, casual restaurant situated in a small strip of shops and medical providers.  Although it was reasonably busy on the night that we were there, my wife and I were able to chat without having to yell or fear that our conversation would be overheard by someone that was inches away.  Our server was generally excellent.: friendly, capable, and gracious  The only flaw was that my empty water glass was removed from the table well before I left and not replaced with a refill. She obviously became sidetracked.  The fried zucchini was satisfactory, but it is the standard \"plank\" version, not the delicious, thinly-sliced, long strips offered by a few choice restaurants like Scoglio Greentree.  Bee'z version was fairly-priced at $5.00, the portion being plenty for an appetizer for two.  My mushroom pizza and my wife's vegetable calzone were generally good, but much of the crust of the calzone was raw, not something one expects with a pricey $17 item.  We ordered a lot of food and had some to take home, but our tab came to in excess of $53 with gratuity, a lot for a weekday meal for two.  During our meal, a young man who appears to be the owner, went through the dining room, greeting and chatting with individuals who are obviously regulars.  He stopped at the booths on both sides of ours, ignoring us.  If one is going through the dining room to greet people, might they not have a kind word for those that he does not know as well, hoping that through extending hospitality, they might become regulars? If this were my restaurant, I would be so grateful to those who dined there that I would let them know in some way that their patronage is appreciated and that I would like to see them again.  We have experienced the same type of disdain at DeBlasio's in Mount Lebanon, where it is obvious that only regulars are acknowledged by management.  If Bee'z offered specials that are not exclusive to the bar area, I might dine there with some regularity. The outstanding Primanti Brothers offers happy hour prices in the restaurant, which enables one to enjoy a glass of wine at the dinner hour for the low, low price of $2.38.  Its pizza is better than Bee'z and it offers 20% bonuses on gift cards at holiday time, enabling the diner to enjoy great prices throughout the year if they stock up as I did.  The restaurant offers the means to provide comments through e-mail.  I took the time and effort to provide detailed thoughts six days ago, providing compliments and constructive criticism, and have received no response yet.",

Extensive menu with wings, burgers, pasta, sandwiches/subs, and specials.  My wife and I have eaten on the bar side during both visits.  First visit we had wings.  This time I had a meatball sandwich and my wife had an Italian sub.  Both were decent sizes and tasty.  Sandwiches only come with chips so we ordered fries which was a small portion size for two.  We both had a few drinks which were fairly priced as well.  Waitress was pretty good and attentive.  There was a slight delay in receiving our drinks but not glaring.  If you are looking for a good bite to eat in the Bridgeville area I definitely recommend Beez.  It's a solid stop.",

The menu is full of multiple options and it took me a while to make a decision. I chose the mushroom swiss burgers and when it arrived to the table, it was a hoagie bun with tons of toasted, melted cheese then two burger patties with mushrooms, lettuce and pickles. It wasnt what I expected but it was really good! My cousin had the spicy chicken quesadilla which she enjoyed. It smelled fantastic and was huge so she took the rest home for leftovers. Our service was decent, she was friendly and checked on us but nothing top notch.",

    "text": "I like this place only being here a few times. They have a pretty extensive menu for being a pub. There are two sides; a restaurant side with tables and booths and a bar side with high top tables and a bar with about a dozen bar stools. Neither side is overly big and it gets crowded on the weekends, especially when they have bands.  Tonite my girlfriends and I went for Trivia night. It was fun and a good crowd. There was however only one waitress tending to all the tables on the bar side. We ordered an appetizer:  bang bang shrimp for the four of us to share. It came out fairly quickly which was nice, but we had to wait for utensils. I never understand why if you're serving food there aren't utensils placed on the table with the condiment and S/P holder? The appetizer was good...so good that we ordered a second! I had the grilled chicken salad and it was good; very generous portion. Nothing out of the ordinary, but good. My GF's shares a chicken/spinach pizza and it looked (and they said it tasted) good. They do their happy hour special daily from 5-7 so certain drinks are 1/2 off and so on. A cool spot to check out.",

Last time we visited, we got the Jalapeno Poppers, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, And Spicy Cajun Steak Hoagie. Steak hoagie wasn't spicy, but the sandwich was good - just needed to add a big of sauce to give it some extra flavor! I was a big fan of the buffalo chicken sandwich as well - they gave you four big pieces of nicely prepared buffalo chicken tenders on the sandwich, the usual fixins, and onion rings!   Prices are super reasonable too, and they have some pretty fun looking drinks! Service is pleasant and although we haven't been here on a super crowded night (we have only come ok Tuesday or Wednesday evenings), there were still a decent number of people around to create a pleasant atmosphere!",

    "text": "The reason I am giving this place 1 star is not so much food quality (although I would say 3 at best for what I had) but is more pertaining to the absence of them to rectify and satisfy a customer complaint.  This restaurant has lost a potential customer.  I eat out a lot and try not to complain but on the rare occasion when I do, I expect that there will at least be an attempt at trying to \"make it right\" by the restaurant.  I had ordered Pasta Marinara and some fried mushrooms for delivery late one night.  The mushroom breading is not great and it came with no sauce.  It wasn't listed on the menu when i checked so I gave this a pass (although I've never run across a restaurant that didn't offer sauce with their fried mushrooms before).  The side salad that came with the pasta actually was the only real bright spot.  The menu online listed the Pasta Marina as \"angel hair pasta topped with homemade marinara sauce and cheese\".  The pasta was definitely not angel hair pasta but regular spaghetti noodles.  The taste was just ok.  It was late and I didn't call about it that night because I was hungry and their delivery was closed by then so I ate a bit of it and decided that I would take to show them the next day, thinking that they should know what is being sent out.  When I took it there the next day, a woman behind the counter said \"it is a misprint in our menu.  I have told the owner several times\"  I told her that I saw it on the online menu (which she admitted might be easier to correct but then just said \"they are working on it\".)  She did apologize but offered nothing to compensate for the fact that I ordered something and didn't get what I was expecting.    So it is apparently a known issue, was brought up to management \"several times\" and nothing has been done about it or process put in place to let customers who order know that it is not angel hair pasta as stated on the menu.  I wonder how long it has been on the menu this way.  Bad form, bad for business the way this was handled (are the employees not authorized to offer compensation when you don't deliver quality or actually the product that they ordered?).  Since it was a known misprint, someone should have informed me when I ordered and ask if I still wanted it.    Does the owner care?",

We start out with an order of 12 wings, all of their sauces are delicious, but my favorites are hot, hot bbq, and honey jalapeno. Their fries are thick, crispy, and tried to perfection, just wait a minute before eating them since they come out piping hot straight from the fryer.   I've never been disappointed with their sandwiches and hoagies. I can't comment on the salads, pastas, other entrees since I love the sandwiches too much to try anything else. Their spicy chicken hoagie is massive, so order a full hoagie if you want lunch and dinner for the next day. The chicken sandwich does not disappoint as well since it comes loaded with huge chicken tenders, bacon, and cheese. What's not to love in that?   Beez will continue to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Cannonsburg area. Even one of my family friends moved away from Pittsburgh over 7 years ago, and the one thing he says he misses the most is going to Beez",

But the turkey was average-at-best and the bacon was limp.  Service left more to be desired as well.  The waitress only came by to take our drink and food orders and deliver our orders.
