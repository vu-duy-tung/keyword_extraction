    "text": "On Sunday I brought my family to the Cadillac Ranch for a dinner after a movie. The weather was nice and we had hoped to sit outside. When we asked the Hostess if we could sit outside she said the patio was closed.  We were then seated at a table next to a column. Our waiter was prompt and took our drink orders OK. When the drinks were delivered my wife's drink spilled a little. At that time we had no napkins or flatware. I got up and retrieved them from a nearby empty booth. The food was average and overpriced. We then had two people form the waitstaff checking on us and both were there when we were presented with the bill. It felt like they were confused about whose table we were at. The whole experience was disconcerting. I would not recommend this place for a dinner.",

Restaurant was just over 50% of capacity and we were approached quickly by our waiter who did a terrific job throughout our meal.   Not knowing the size of the item we started the dinner with an order of Cadillac Ranch Kettle Chips which were tasty and sized for a group of four. His sirloin with a side of asparagus was correctly cooked and my Chicken Carbonara was above average.  Cadillac Ranch would be a great place for a small group (we observed 3 groups of 6-8 friends/co-workers enjoying large table settings) and most families. The decor is fun and there are enough TV's for most sports junkies. If you're looking for a quiet setting that's conducive to quiet conversation, this is definitely not the place. Prices are reasonable as we escaped with a tab of around $75 that included the appetizer, entrees, cocktail, soft drinks and gratuity.  Give it a try. It's an interest setting where we found good service, and above average food at a decent price.",

We called ahead to make a reservation,  upon arrival the hostess advised us because we were such a large party to sit beside or close to anyone that you were going to be sharing a bill with.  Half of our party was seated,  we were approached by our servers to take drink orders.  While they were away,  more people arrived and we had to adjust seating.  When our servers returned,  we were snapped at and asked if we had chosen our final seats.  Rude.  We were treated with absolutely nothing but attitude by one of the servers the entire time.  Maybe she didn't get the memo that big parties = big tips. The majority of our food arrived on time but one of the meals did not arrive until nearly everyone was finished.  Not even an apology. The food is not worth the cost.  Period.  We work relatively close for a large Pittsburgh company and although convenient,  we will be sure to steer clear of Cadillac Ranch for any future outtings.",

Inside the decor is nice...very traditional sports bar with lots of TVs and sports images. It's very clean and overall looks good.   However, my meal was disappointing. I ordered the A1 burger. As always, I ordered it medium, challenging the chef's skills at making the perfect burger. He got it wrong, my burger was well done and a bit dry. If you're going to screw up a medium burger I'd prefer it be well done, so at least I can eat it. But I was disappointed. The beer selection is also traditional, I didn't see anything different, or local, to try.   I should have checked Yelp first before going, since the reviews aren't raving. Lesson learned.",

    "text": "Another enigma in Pittsburgh dining. Why does a place called Cadillac Ranch come with a country western theme? Why does it have a bull ride off to one side? Why do they remove the tables for a certain area and have line dancing? Blah  What does Cadillac Ranch have? Bad food, Highly caloric bad food. With my trusty smart phone in hand, I went to their websight, looked up the nutritional guide and not one thing on the dinner menu had anything healthy. Mac & Cheese with blackened chicken: 3500 calories and over 120 grams of fat. Luckily, beer is vegan. myself and friend of Joe named Jamie (also fellow vegan friend of Joe, Jamie) went in here one night after having a wonderful dinner at nearby, Loving Hut (Read my Review!) and stopped by the Barnes and Noble next door. I remembered the Buccos were playing and I said to Jamie, Let's stop at Cadillac Ranch and have a cold one.  Buccos blew the game in the sixth when we sat down, I sat in front of the taps and saw Stone IPA, mouth already watering I ordered one. Extended happy hour? My beer was only three bucks, and that was a full pint. Good deal. Jamie had a wheat beer that i never caught the name of, the guy always goes for the wheat.  As it goes, they had a duo playing guitars on the patio mostly cover Black Crows tunes, the crowd seemed to enjoy them. I watched the big screens behind the bar and enjoyed people watching. The frat boys on my other side ordered wings that looked pretty good. Nice and meaty, pretty good size, more of the meaty wing joint than the \"other\" part of the wing. Probably 8 or ten in an order. The place was packed.   So I gave you the good with the bad, I'll leave it up to you to decide your own fate.",

After reprimanding me for being late (she was just joking), that started the enjoyable service.  Sonya was friendly, funny and professional, especially after we all kept changing our minds.   After looking at the regular menu, there was a special menu with a roast turkey dinner, since it was a week or so before Thanksgiving. This meal was excellent, with real roasted turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green beans and cranberry sauce (not the jelly kind, but a really tasty one).  The meal could have been hotter, but it was very good and plenty for lunch the next day.  The price was reasonable,   Having been to the CR several times, I have never had a bad meal, poor service, or a bad experience.",

It has soggy lettuce and flavorless dressing. The only flavor was imparted by the limited Szechwan peanut sauce and the only enjoyable texture came from the crispy wonton strips. I was going to get the Pittsburgh Steak Salad, but it was a bit too pricey in a land where you can get the same thing at nearly any pizza joint and be at least confident that it will be OK for half the price. The lady got a side of sweet potato tots, which sounded like they were going to be awesome, but they were not crunchy enough and very mushy inside.

Watering -- fine; drink refreshment -- fine.  Layout, wide and varied.  Dozens of big screen tv's -- located in a major shopping mall area.  Put in a live band and they would rock (so to speak).  Prices in line with chains in the area.    What caught my attention was the communication about a chardonnay that was ordered; the waitress said, I think it is a cut above \"house brands,\" but if you do not like it, we'll find something else for you.  No fuss, no eye rolling, just a service establishment courtesy.  Sonny was a welcome respite from the \"oh so many\" folk who know nothing about helping people enjoy an evening out.  And as a sports bar it has \"pods\" of TV's -- perhaps over 24!  (True).  f8 and be there",

    "text": "First time visitors here and we won't be returning to this location ever again.  We opted to sit in the bar area because there was a 40 minute wait, yet there were numerous open tables.  1. Our waitress either had too many tables that she couldn't handle or she should look for a new job. She was there to take our order and came back quickly when it was time pay but other than that she was rarely seen throughout the meal. We had to ask her and other wait staff to clear dishes from our table on numerous occasions.  2. The food was not impressive. The lobster bisque was barely warm and extremely runny. It was more like a broth instead of a soup. I ordered it with extra crackers and by the time they were finally delivered, the soup was cold. The thousand island dressing tastes funny, sorta like it has ranch in it. The shrimp tacos were also barely warm but the steaks and kids grilled chicken were sizzling hot.  3. We ordered the kids brownie sundae for the 2 kids at our table to split. It took an extremely long time for it to come out and when it was finally placed on the table, the aluminum dish that the brownie came in was so hot that it burned my fingers to touch it. Why would you ever serve a child ANYTHING that was scorching hot?  $180 for 4 adults and 2 children under 4 for just mediocre food is absolutely ridiculous if you ask me.",

I always take forever to figure out what I want to eat and the waitress was very patient with me which I appreciate lol. I got blackened tilapia with smashed redskin potatoes and balsamic drizzle - SO GOOD. My boo got fish tacos which were tiny but meant to be a smaller plate- he said they were delicious as well. The server was so accommodating (I always have a billion leftovers) she gave us boxes and to go cups for our drinks (this is a huge thing for me I dunno why) and got the check for us right when we were ready to go.

The ONLY reason for the 2nd star is because our waitress was really sweet.   We ordered an appetizer, which was really good (tower of onion rings). I ordered the meatloaf, substituting broccoli for corn. Hubs ordered cowboy cut rib eye, rare. Food comes out. Take a bite and want to spit it out. My meatloaf was DISGUSTING. It was dry. It was over seasoned with some green stuff. There was no BBQ gravy at all. My corn was dry and tasteless. I took maybe 6 bites. It was awful. Husband's steak was cooked Pittsburgh rare..... NOT what he ordered.... He wanted rare. Not charred on the outside, raw on the inside. Served the steak with a dull steak knife. I'm pretty sure the butter knife on the table would have worked better.   We didn't see a single manager even on the floor.... On a Saturday night.... During dinner. Every corporate restaurant I have ever worked at and dined in, it is required for a manager to go to every single table. Apparently not here though. They really should have came to check on us though because I wasn't about to complain to my server. Being in the industry, I know that it isn't the servers fault the kitchen messed up or made things wrong. I wasn't about to put that on her shoulders. She already had 4 drunk morons sitting across from us and several other tables.   We will not be back. I promise that. Paid $75 for a meal we really disliked....",

No lemon flavor, what so ever.  I was still able to eat is because 1)  I avoid wasting animal products for the sake of the animal 2) I can dab the oil off.  My friend got this steak that was bunt to a crisp.  He didn't even eat it.  The server didn't even ask how everything was or what was wrong with it.  When your customer orders something and doesn't put a dent in it and doesn't want to wrap it up, something's probably wrong and it would be in the server's best interest to ask.  Nope.  Either he didn't give a hoot and/or he's dumb.  \"Eek!  Me thinks not\" may be a little too harsh.... but I can say in full confidence that I  will not be returning.",

    "text": "I made reservations at the Cadillac Ranch for my daughter's hs graduation. The main reason we chose this spot was because of the outdoor fire pit. There were no issues while making the reservations. The manager Tim was very accommodating, funny and friendly. That is, until half hour into my arrival when he called asking if I wanted to have it indoors due to the possibility of rain. It didn't really look like it would pour; however he subtly pushed for me to agree. So, in the midst of the crowd and taking pictures, I told him we would give it a shot (go indoors); with the idea of going back to my original reservation outside if it didn't look like rain. When we got there, they had set us up inside. It was nice and all but it was extremely loud and we wanted to be able to enjoy the breeze and have conversations. I mean, my family traveled hours to see my daughter graduate; why would we want to sit inside with loud music. Tim said he could turn down the music and we said no; because it's a bar/grill and people were hanging out. Then he admitted that one of the fire pits were broken and the other was taken. He said it had been broken for 2 days. So, here was the truth (it was so obvious what had happened)- They gave our spot, the only working fire pit, to another group; thinking they would leave before we got there. The group never left; therefore, my group got screwed over. But why lie about it? Anyway, we still chose to sit in the fire pit area; despite it being broken. From there, the waitress and Tim did their best to serve us and kept checking in to see if we were good. At the end,  Tim offered us free dessert for the inconvenience. It worked out well because I didn't have enough time to grab my daughter's graduation cake, balloons and champagne from my house, as it was completely out the way. The food was delicious! I ordered the Appetizer Buffet Option #2: bbq wings, sliders, shrimp cocktail, cheese and crackers, and tortillas with artichoke and spinach dip and a veggie tray with ranch. Half the people in our group barely ate and we were able to take the leftovers with us. Overall, despite the incident with the fire pit, I truly enjoyed the ambiance and will recommend this place to friends and family. I will definitely be back! Three stars for an honest review and fire pit disappointment.",

    "text": "It pays to have low expectations!  Stopped here for lunch out of pure curiosity, not expecting much.  Chose to sit on the patio, was greeted in a decent amount of time by Brandy. She was very patient and helpful. Definitely made the experience gain an extra star.  Ordered the spinach dip as an app, like most restaurants there weren't nearly enough chips on the plate but we were delightfully offered more. The dip tasted pretty fresh unlike most chains variations.  My date had the lemon mushroom chicken, which was very tasty. I ordered the Diablo chicken pasta which wasn't as good. The sauce wasn't bad and the pasta cooked to a good temperature but the chicken was just tough and chewy- not of the same consistency as the lemon mushroom chicken.   All in all I'd say this place isn't too far from an Applebee's or Friday's type concept. The restaurant itself was clean and very spacious, sadly I'm not sure if it's completely worth the price.",

When we spoke up, we were told it would be another 40 minutes. Once seated, we waited another 20 minutes. Our waiter had very little time for us. He flew through the motions without sincerity. We experienced further disappointment when the food arrived. The burgers were dry. The flatbread crust was cracker-like. The toppings on the flatbread were lacking and flavorless. The shrimp tacos were slider size, speckled with a few shrimp here and there. They were more like an appetizer or kids meals than a regular meal. We left with both our belly's and wallets empty.",

    "text": "Cadillac Ranch feels like someone decided to cross a TGI Friday's with a typical nightclub, then throw a thin Southwestern-style decor over everything. The ambiance comes off feeling really shallow, and the wait staff seems about on par for what you'd expect in a venue of this nature - attentive if the place isn't busy, but if you're here on a Friday after work... expect to wait.   They used to have a mechanical bull which was fun to watch drunk people try to ride, but it's gone (heard it needed some work in addition to liability issues).  The clientele here is definitely a bit older. As a 20-something young professional, I found myself getting chatted up by what I'd call \"cougars\" at least once per visit during happy hour.   The bar isn't anything special selection-wise, either. Not to mention that they charged me $2 to put a drink on the rocks. The next time, I just asked for a glass of ice along with my drink neat, and it didn't cost me a dime. The bartender agreed this was weird, but that's how it works.  There's a number of options in the Settler's Ridge complex which I'd suggest before CR.",

I've been here maybe 5 times & it's always because someone plans a happy hour & this is the place that they choose. I want to see my friends but I loathe having come here. And, I noted that other reviewers said they got sick - the first time I ever ate something here I got food poisoning!! I was at the movies after eating something here & had to leave & run home. Was sick all night, thought thankfully was better in the morning.  So last night I was here again to meet up with a bunch of friends & discuss a bachelorette party we were all planning. They have drink specials & discounted apps during happy hour BUT you have to be sitting outside to get them. Um, it was 55 degrees outside. The waitress then said we could sit at the bar, this was after we had been sitting at a table for 20 minutes & had ordered drinks & stuff. Why can't we have the specials too?? Who is the genius who thought it was ok to give some patrons special prices on things & forcing others to pay full price?   Our waitress was half asleep & would disappear for long stretches. She seemed bored and/or annoyed with us. We waited forever for our first round of drinks.  My mushroom flatbread pizza was disgusting. COLD & awful. The cheese wasn't melted, the arugala wasn't the least bit stuck to the rest of the flatbread & the onions weren't caramelized. I paid like $12 for food I didn't even eat. My friends' food looked god awful too & they did some mini desserts - both the sorbet & the cherry cobbler were excessively sweet & nasty.  My bill was $20 for ONE beer & one awful, cold, nasty \"flatbread\".   After last night, I told my friends, no matter what, I am NOT coming back to this dump. EVER.",

The bar staff was inattentive and the simple drinks we ordered left much to be desired as neither had much alcohol present for the hefty price.  We got an appetizer after the bar maid described it to us only for it to come and not be anything like what was described.  Second visit was for dinner.  Two pasta dishes were ordered as well as Filet Mignon.  The pasta dishes were dry, bland and lacked ingredients that were mentioned to be present in the dish on the menu.  The Filet came drenched in A1 sauce.    Once dinner was over, our waitress was no where to be found.    This restaurant has a great atmosphere but must become more than a mediocre drinking hole.",

    "text": "UPDATE:  Woke up with gastrointestinal discomfort and a sick feeling the morning after my meal at this place.  I have adjusted my rating accordingly.  Horribly mismanaged restaurant.  Bottom line.  The food was actually pretty decent, when it finally arrived.  That's the only reason that this review gets two stars.  (UPDATED to 1 star after waking up sick from the meal.)  The wait staff was a mixture of new people, like our server Zack, who was eager to please and facing impossible odds, and bad attitude people, like the young woman who ignored us and when stopped by our party, told us that we would be served by another person whom she would tell to come visit our table. (She never bothered to tell him, and we stopped him ourselves after waiting over 20 minutes.)  And then there was the manager, Anna, who didn't look or act like a manager, and who actually argued with us about our food and who made admonishing remarks to us when questioned about the food.    The place wasn't really all that busy, but the bar took forever to get our drinks ready.  Refills were even slower, or we most certainly would have had more drinks and created a larger tab.  We waited a very long time for our food to come out of the kitchen, and several times while we were waiting, other crew members whom we had not previously met came outside and asked us (and every other table around us) if the food they were carrying was for us.  This happened over and over again.  Apparently, even though there were only seven tables in the outdoor dining area, there is no system in place to tell the servers which table to take the food to.    We felt sorry for our waiter.  He was a very conscientious young man who was put in a bad situation.  Three of the four meals were good.  One was simply bad and didn't meet the description on the menu.  The manager (Anna) made some terribly lame excuse about the meal that was not even remotely close to the description on the menu, and actually insulted the person who was unhappy with the food.  The waiter took that poorly prepared meal back and replaced it with another selection that did more closely resemble the description in the menu, and everybody was content until the visit from the manager, who was defensive, argumentive, and seemingly unknowledgable.  Nobody in our party really cared that she had \"fifteen years of experience in the business,\" because the bottom line was that despite the decent quality of the food served, her restaurant was so poorly mismanaged that four people were totally turned off by the experience and  were unanimous in their decision that they'd never give the place a second chance.",

Once again not bad for $6 during happy hour. not a great selection of wines however their house wines are only $3 during happy hour silent with that. Excellent service by multiple people making sure I was at end of two at the bar!",

I honestly thought the bartender couldn't smile or show any facial expression but I was wrong because she had no problem smiling and laughing with her coworkers at the other corner! A different time I got a drink and an app on a very slow night maybe 5 tables in the whole place? Whole experience took 2 hours and we had to flag our waitress down twice! not because she was busy or anything she was just sitting at the bar with another waitress talking. I've been a waitress for 6+ years and I normally tip 20% to half the bill for great service. But it really irritates me when I bust my booty off with a smile everyday and run around like a chicken with my head cut off at my job. Then go to eat at another establishment and get treated like an inconvenience.",

The food happy hour menu includes $3, $4, and $5 level options and they all seemed awesome (wings, nachos, flatbread pizza). Everything seemed incredibly worth the money and the dead were awesome for happy hour. It did however take a bit of time (maybe because it was packed the day I went after work) but otherwise it was an awesome HH experience and I definitely would return to Cadillac Ranch... especially for those delicious nachos and pretzels sticks! I can't speak to the rest of the menu at all but the place seemed crowded and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves so I'm sure the sit down dinner was also a great deal.",

Somehow I don't see this property or the staff there all that invested in the satisfaction of new clientele but more into regulars who drop a ton of money there which likely is subsidized by daily corporate budgets or entertainment funds.

Sat at the bar. The place was not busy AT ALL. When we sat down we noticed the bartenders/waitressing in a group talking and they alllllllllllll looked at us and just went on with their conversations. We continued to sit and wait to be greeted. Another couple walks in- must of been frequent customers- they got greeted right away and got served drinks by the same guy who looked at me and my boyfriend several times with no acknowledgement. Finally a woman comes over. We order right away - drinks and appetizers. That was the last we saw of our \"waitress\". The food was okay, nothing bad to say about it. But we finished the appetizers and our drinks and continued to just sit. Multiple employees clearly saw our empty plates and glasses. But nothing. And our waitress had disappeared. Finally flagged a different lady down and asked for check. Was told \"sure, one second ! \". Again, continued to sit with no check. Waited about another 15 then had to flag same girl down and ask for a second time for our check. The service at this place is beyond awful. The worst i have ever experienced. Please consider hiring new bartenders/waitresses. Very rude and unprofessional.",

I had originally spoke with a very kind gentleman bartender who started my tab.  I wanted to wait until everyone arrived to order my food. And also see what the happy hour specials were. I did order a glass of wine  though. There were a few other bartenders working.  I didn't realize they were apparently working together. There was a female that was extremely unhappy . It was clear to all of us.  She never smiled. She must have been having a bad day.  I felt bad for her and uncomfortable at the same time.  I didn't complain or ask for anything special. The food was cold when it arrived. We ordered 5 different appetizers from the happy hour menu. The other 2 bartenders were great but for some reason they were letting the other lady take care of us.  I don't got out often and feel like she put a damper on the whole experience. I hope she has a better day tomorrow. Bar food. Nothing special.",

Disappointing.   I go to Cadillac Ranch about 3 times a month. I also bring employees every few months. I get the pork chops every time, they are pretty good. The service is normally subpar at best.   Today, at 2:20pm I walked in with my wife and as usual, the girl with ZERO enthusiasm says \"2?\"  I said yes, two as another girl grabbed two menus and walked to our table. My wife says \"thank you\" and the girl responds with \"yeah\" as she is making no eye contact and walking off.   About 10 minutes goes by and no waitress yet. She finally comes and wife orders a frozen margarita. The waitress says your blender is broken, and she isn't sure if it's working because they haven't bought a new one yet.   Three points here 1. Bad service has finally lost a customer. I will never return. 2. You sell $20 pork chops, buy a new blender. 3. I seriously doubt the blender is even broken. I guarantee your employees just didn't want to make one.  YOU THINK THE BLENDER IS BROKEN? THINK?  THEN GO CHECK!!!! WOW...  if the company wants to find out who the employees were, just ask them about the guy who told them they sucked as he walked out.   I'm sure as a company or managers you have every excuse in the book why you have 181 Yelp reviews and a 2.5 star rating, however, you are what your customers say you are. You officially suck.",

    "text": "I used to love Cadillac Ranch and often go before the I go to Cinemark. It's usually perfect because their happy hour is from 5-7 and we usually got to the 7:00 or 7:30 movie. Happy hour used to encompass $5 martinis, but now they are $6 which isn't a a big deal but I was very annoyed with the dynamics of the bar. My friend and I ordered cocktails because the happy hour menu said, \"$2 off all cocktails.\" We selected our drinks from the portion of the menu titled \"cocktails.\" After our second round, she informed us that cocktails were consider drinks such as a rum and Coke, vodka cranberry, etc. I politely told her that we ordered from the cocktail menu and her reply was, \"Well, it's not my rules.\" In addition, the bartenders did not communicate well. One bartender would take our order and then another one would come over and ask if we wanted to order. It was very disorganized. They had live music while we were there... at 5:30. It was SO LOUD I couldn't even hear my friend who was sitting right next to me. The only good thing I have to say is that the pepperoni sausage flatbread was pretty good! Other than that, the unprofessionalism really turned me away.",

It was a Friday night - 9 PM and many empty bar stools.    It definitely has changed since the last time I visited. The service was good because it wasn't too crowded and the noise level was down a bit so it was ideal if you were trying to talk to someone... noise level down.     After only 1 drink-- me and my friend decided to go somewhere else.   The atmosphere just wasn't cutting it for the good mood I was in... it was bit somber.   I had to give at least three stars in this review because I have had many good visits in the past.. from happy hour gatherings, blind dates, and work function dinners.  I  just think maybe there's too much competition out at the point now.",

Secondly, we asked for a box to take the left over food which they never brought.   Food is also disappointing. We ordered margherita pizza, spinach artichoke dip and potato chips. The pizza is very bland and unappealing. It had absolutely no flavor. However, I managed to eat 3 slices since  I was very hungry. Even after requesting them to add less toppings to the chips, they loaded our chips with toppings. So, that was a miss too. My friend liked the spinach and artichoke dip, but she never got a box to take the leftover.   Overall, very disappointing experience. I don't think I will go back again.",

Anyway, the hostess didn't seem like she wanted to seat me, because she kept pushing for me to go to the bar. Finally I got a table and Alexis came and took my order and waited on me. She was awesome. Definitely felt a little out of place, as there was lots of drinking and dancing going on, but I was hungry. Alexis really took care of me. Her only \"slip up\" of the night was after she brought my credit card receipt back she said, \"Have a good night...okay?\" (tilt of the head). Ouch! I'm out of town and I was hungry and it was late. I ordered the Basalmic Chicken. It was actually pretty dang good. Three chicken breasts, mashed potatoes and green beans. It was really loud in here, but that's to be expected on a Saturday night.

After sitting for 5 minutes , I got up walked around to the other side of the bar and asked for some service and menus . The bartender handed us menus wihout saying too much of anything . The speciality drink menu is limited and I felt pricey . I had a pizza at the bar and that was good . All and all not a bad place and with a friendlier staff this place could be fun for happy hours and later on a Friday or Saturday night . They do have a mechanical bull to ride but we were told that it only operates after 10 pm on wednesday to Saturday nights ???  Why so limited hours for something that would be fun anytime , I don't know .",

When we were finally greeted by a very friendly young lady the rest of our visit went very well. We order the Margarita Flatbread pizza and it was DELICIOUS!! We then ordered our entrees. They came out rather quickly and we were pleased. The prices are a bit high to eat there on a regular basis but we felt the prices were pretty on with the portion sizes. Overall experience was nice.  There are dozens of restaurants in the area to choose from. For the prices, service needs to get better to attract customers. I truly believe that the \"recession\" is not hurting restaurants...it's the employees and managers hurting the restaurants.

It took 40 minutes after she took our order for us to get our food.  We never got refills of our drinks.  The food was decent but not worth the price.  The service was some of the worst that I've had in a long time.  I would hate to see how bad the service is when the place is actually busy.  The atmosphere is pretty cool and there are nice outdoor sitting areas.  This may be a better place to just come for a drink instead of to sit down with a family to eat.",

    "text": "Cadillac Ranch is a convenient stop for a drink or bite for those going around Settler's Ridge. It's pretty large and has a lot of seating so it's usually pretty quick to get seated. They have a good selection of beers and drinks and their food is pretty standard. We've gone for boneless wings the last few visits. The first time, the wings were ready quickly and tasty! The last few times though, there was quite a long wait and the wings seemed to be mostly breading and very little meat. May just be hit or miss depending on the day.   Nonetheless, it's a solid place to stop for a beer or break!",

The tuna and green beans were great, but the fries were soggy, and the dipping sauce provided was gross.   The customer service was lacking, as I had to ask the bartender upon entering to get my food as the host was not present.   As the service and food was subpar, so is my rating.",

Since the bar was open we did sit down to talk and have a few drinks, we talked with the bartender for awhile.  It was nice atmosphere not that many people there on a Monday night.  They keep the bar really clean and offer a complete menu of drinks and drinks are very good.  The first drink I tried was the black cherry margarita which I didn't take a picture of, but it was sweet and tarty with a kick and it was good.  Pictures below is something I asked the bartender to be creative and make whatever she wants, but sticking with tequila which is what I was already drinking and is in the picture I took.  I think this was a tequila sunrise.  I can't wait to come back and try the food I can always smell the good aroma from the parking lot.",

Gone is the mechanical bull ride. Another type of game off in the corner has taken its place. Even the rest rooms have changed-the stalls are painted black along with black toilets.  The place was fairly empty and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. They do offer one perk-If you are going to the movies that day or have seen a movie and have the stub then they will give you one entree at half price as long as you purchase one at regular price. Fortunately I had our tickets on my phone so she accepted that as our coupon.  My husband had a barbecue chicken tossed salad. I went with the French onion burger. Instead of paying the up charge for sweet potato fries I asked substitute broccoli for the regular fries. I ordered medium well but I guess I should have had it well done because I'm no fan of seeing \"pink\" in the middle. The burger was okay-nothing to write home about. They do give you a good size of broccoli which was filling.  Seemed like it took a long time to get our drinks replenished but the waitress finally did. Place is a bit pricey for the food but the coupon helped soften the blow. Made for an easy walk to the theater so my husband could rest his foot.",

I've visited the restaurant before ordering the meatloaf and two different steaks.  I ordered the BBQ pork chops off of the seasonal menu.  Portions were gigantic.  Cooked to perfection.  It came with mashed potatoes and succotash.  My friend ordered a steak and was quite happy with his meal as well.  My only gripe was the drink prices.  6.50 for a mixed drink with well vodka seems excessive.  My friend inquired about if the wine was dry and the waitress had absolutely no idea.  It's a shame there are no happy hour specials or I would return more often.",

    "text": "I've visited Cadillac Ranch on many occasions so I figure it's time I officially give them a review. While I haven't been here many times for a sit down dinner I have been here many times for happy hour. With the Cinemark right next door it's a great place to meet up for drinks/appetizers before a show. Especially on a Tuesday for discount movie day!  The few times I actually sat down for a meal I was impressed with the food. I typically always go with a salad and I've always liked them. They also have a lot of really good drinks on their menu. Their mojito's are amazing! My only complaint is that their drink prices are fairly expensive. Because they are so expensive I typically never order them. I stick to basic drinks during happy hour to avoid paying those prices.  Last but not least, I want to hit on their awesome happy hour. Besides Mad Mex I would say this is definitely my favorite happy hour spot in Robinson. They have a happy hour food menu which includes different items for $3, $4, and $5. Some of the items include chicken quesadilla, boneless wing, chili nachos, fries, soft pretzels, tacos, flatbreads, etc. Over the years I have tried a lot of them and I have to say the only one so far that I haven't liked is the chicken quesadilla's. My go to is always the nachos and I'm actually very picky about my nachos. So trust me they are good.   If you haven't tried Cadillac Ranch for happy hour or dinner yet I highly recommend it! They also do live music in the summer outside which is really nice and I think they even have a special on entrees if you stop in after a movie with your ticket stub.",

    "text": "A group of 4 of us ladies visited here on Saturday, July 3 at 7PM.  I ordered the steak salad for $13.95 (pretty pricey) and asked for the steak medium.  The steak came way overcooked, the edges were black and the meat was hard.  Upon returning the steak I received a new one which was still well done and not medium the way I ordered.  BTW the steak comes sliced on the plate so the cooks and the waitress should have easily seen how well done it was.    If that was our only issue I would probably be okay but there is more.    The service was terrible!  Our server was \"Nikki J.\"  She ignored us throughout our entire meal.  I needed more dressing for my salad but she was no where to be found.  My friend had some that she shared with me.  When the waitress finally returned after our meals were complete she asked if we wanted any dessert.  We ordered more cocktails and my friend ordered a coffee.  When she brought our drinks she also brought our checks.  Did we ask for our checks???  No.  Did we look like we were even close to being done??  No.  The coffee was terrible, old and cold.  Did the waitress ever come back and check on us or notice that the coffee was not touched?? No.  Remember she had already brought us our checks.  After at least a half hour we paid our bills.  Did the waitress ask us if we needed anything else?  No.  We would have ordered more drinks.  My one friend had to ask for a refill of her iced tea.  She brought us our receipts to sign and after about another half hour she returned and asked if she could take our receipts.  It was clear that she getting ready to go home.  We weren't!!!  Still no one asked if we needed anything.  Shortly thereafter we saw our waitress leave.  Three of us still stayed until after 1AM.  Still sitting at the same table.  Still with no one waiting on us.  At one point we went up to the bar to order more drinks and then returned to the table.  There were other waitresses around waiting on other tables but not ours.  After our waitress left we were discussing how we should speak to a manager.  Do you think we ever saw one?  No.  We were there from 7PM until after 1AM and we had a total of 3 drinks, one of which we had to go up to the bar and get ourselves.  And these were $6.54 martinis!!  You think someone would have wanted to wait on us??",

That's crazy since there ribs are microwaved. He had wings as an appetizer and couldn't even eat them they were that bad. I had the salmon with green beans and mashed potatoes it was ok, nothing to rave about. None the less we paid over 100.00 for bad food, bad service. I'll never go back.",

We had a large party for my birthday (15 people) last night and after we got to our table INside I had reserved a week before requesting outdoor seating weather permitting (it was beautiful out) one of the 2 servers we had said to us \"are you done moving seats yet?\" In a snotty tone which was her attitude the whole time... Then we got or drinks and ordered our food... Everyone got their food except me (I ordered fish and chips) and the other server apologized saying there was a mix up, it would be out in 2 minutes. That would have been fine except that i t didn't come out 2 mins later it came out an HOUR AND 13 MINS later.... The manager comped my meal but didn't bother to apologize to me... The servers brought out shots for everyone and didn't say it was from them so everyone at my table was asking each other who ordered them, it was very confusing.... And my fish was not good it was pretty much all batter w a hint of fish inside.... I was thoroughly upset that my birthday dinner was a huge let down w the awful service and not so great meal... Others at my table got the fish tacos and they were good.. But that is the only positive thing I can say unfortunately",

After 9pm gab-alot it still gabbing...then we find out from him the mechanical bull is down.  Now, that's bull!  Like I said, I will come back for possibly drinks and the bull ride, but other than that this is a forgettable place where I would rather not spend a dime.",

We ordered a margarita flat bread pizza and wings to start. The best part of the pizza was the crust, as expected it was crispy. But the pizza had no taste to it at all, very bland. The wings came out cold, and were below average in quality. Our entrees were not any better. My wife ordered the fish and chips. The fries were okay, the fish was greasy and overcooked. While this is better than being undercooked, it tasted like it was fried in 2 week old oil that has not been filtered or cleaned. VERY GREASY, VERY GROSS!!! I ordered the Pittsburgh Steak Salad, and was unimpressed. The steak was undercooked for how I ordered it, and very bland. They used steak fries that were in a greasy cheesy pile on one side of the plate. I would have preferred to have the fries my wife was served with her fish and chips on my salad.  Overall, 1 star is too good. This was our first and only visit. I found it too dark, with bad club music. With a name like Cadillac Ranch, and an advertisement for a mechanical bull, I expected more of a country music atmosphere. Prices were slightly more expensive than they should of been for the amount of food served, and way too expensive for the quality of food.",

If you can find some good drink specials it would be a cool place to have happy hour, (assuming the bartender provides better service than the waiters), just don't think about eating anything. For 2 beers, an appetizer portion of cheeseburger sliders with COLD soggy tasteless fries, and a pulled pork sandwich with the same fries it ran us about $40.00 plus tip.   They clearly spent all their money on the atmosphere and next to nothing on food and staff training. Wouldn't go back.",

I can't comment to the food as I've never ordered anything off the menu except for drinks.  Drinks were decent and service was ok.

The gentleman sitting next to me and I adVised her that we had been waiting an unnecessarily long time. She took our order with almost no apology for the service.    after completing my meal she Asked if I wanted another drink to which I replied not yet.  Within minutes she asked of I wanted to cash out to which I replied not yet.  A few minute later she came back she came back and asked again. At this point i said sure She brought me the bill And I inquired why she was in a hurry to have me leave.  Basically I guess I wasn't ordering drinks fast enough for her.  The gentleman sitting next to me stated that he had never seen this ever happen.   To make matters worse, if they could be, I spoke to the manager on the way out. He was almost dismissive of my complaint.  I wasn't looking for any compensation just acknowledgement.",

It was the strangest thing!  It looked like meat and felt like meat, but there was absolutely no taste!  And to top off the icky burger was the limp fries.  NO ONE wants a limp fry...am I right ladies (and men of course!)?    My hubs got the ribs and I quote him....\"they were less than ok.\"  That pretty much sums up the whole place.

    "text": "This place does not disappoint, despite the  constant craze of high volume customer flow. They seem to care about each and every customer and their food.  I cannot express enough, how impressed I am with their food, the quality and presentation. Some of my favorites: candied pork chops, no bull burger, black and blue salmon salad and their flat bread variations.   Also, props to the bartenders who actually care about how much you've had to drink. The willingness to call a cab, offer food or anything else that displays concern was highly impressive.   Another incident that deserves praise, was when I ordered the salmon salad as take out. When I arrived to pick it up, the hostesses assured me that it was being prepped and should be out soon. I proceeded to pay for it in advance and waited in the lobby/receiving area. I observed the hostesses as they alternately checked on my order. They were extremely polite and apologetic for the long wait. After 20 minutes one of them came up to me and truthfully shared that the cooks had just started cooking the salmon. She seemed scared, but kept her professional composure. I finally decided to let her know, that it was ok and that I was in no rush. I also shared that I'd rather have the cooks take the time to prep the food correctly, instead of \"half ass-ing\" it.   After a total of an hour wait, I received my to-go salad with a receipt that stated that the food was on the house. What a wonderful and unexpected surprise! Most restaurants still try to get your money in this situation.  Bravo to Cadillac ranch and on the superior training of their staff.  Thank you for showing you care!",

It. Is. Disgusting. My skin is crawling just thinking about it. Please do America a favor and refrain from giving this place any more money than it already has. Please. For your children's sake.",

When I say awful, it is hands down the WORST service that I have ever received in any service industry establishment.  I travel all over the US for months at a time and this is the slowest and poorest service I have ever received! And to top it off the bartender who my wife and I once did receive decent service from, I tipped him $50 and the next time we came In, he was too busy flirting with a girl that was sitting at the bar and asked a server to come wait on us instead.  It's a shame that with such great food, that it takes hours to get your food and it takes hours to get a drink because the bartender Is too busy fitting with the women at the bar!  Hopefully the cooks leave and start a new restaurant and leave all the servers and bartenders behind.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Friday with a dining companion.  Cadillac Ranch was extremely crowded upon arriving and we were told that there would be a 45 minute wait.  During the wait we got to check out he decor of the restaurant which was nice with lots of music and Western apparel visible.  Our wait did only last as long as we were told but it was very frustrating as there were many open tables that were not being sat.  We watched one table sit for 20 minutes between being cleaned and having people put in it.  The table that we were eventually put in sat for at least 10 minutes before we were seated.  It's not like there were spreading out the tables for the servers either as our server was triple-sat in a 5 minute window.  For me this was very perplexing as the bars were beyond packed and the wait list was not too long.  For dinner I ended up ordering the Ranch Mac' N Cheese while my dining companion had the pork chops.  Our dinner was served quickly and my Mac' N Cheese came out piping hot.  It's flavor was great and it was something that I thoroughly enjoyed eating.  My dining companion also enjoyed her pork chops.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back to the Cadillac Rance again but not on a weekend night.  Their food was great and although they quoted the right amount of time to be seated, it was very frustrating to see the many empty tables sitting for a long time before the hostess would seat people.",

We both had the filet and it was great. The service was also pretty timely.  If I had to complain about anything, it would be the garlic sauce on the filet. It was just a little much and my steak was cooked medium instead of rare. On most steaks medium would be a problem, but with the tenderness of the filet, it was nothing at all. Great place! I'll be back!",

When we ordered drinks prior to the meal, my friend who is 21 ordered a beer while I ordered a water since I'm under 21, when we did this she rudely informed us that she couldn't serve him alcohol because I was under 21 and she said it was \"dram shop\" law. She stated that we needed to google the law, which we did and it stated that bars are not allowed to serve alcohol to customers who appear intoxicated. When she brought us the check right after the meal she did not even thank us. I also heard other tables surrounding us complaining about how rude she was.   As for the food, it was decent and large portions but still not worth it for the price. Ambience was nice as we sat out on the patio, but still don't think I'll go back!",

    "text": "Although the Cadillac Ranch is a visually attractive venue, its food is disappointingly bad. When one looks at the photos of its food offerings, it is easy to be impressed. But the food delivered to one's table is something  else again.   I recently ordered one of their featured items-- a large bowl of chili. The bowl was  huge. However, there was very little chili and what there was war burnt and tasteless. They gave me a lot of colored tortilla chips, which I found totally unappetizing. Considering how the beans were  falling apart, I suspect that the chili was days old and simply reheated too many times. It wasn't nearly as good as the chili at Wendy's.   It's a sad day when a joint that pretends to be upscale can't match the food of a fast food restaurant.   On another occasion, I ordered a burger with fries--common enough fare. The burger was dry and tasteless and the fries were cold. Once again, it didn't equal the burgers turned out by a fast food restaurant. You would do a lot better with a Five Guys burger.  To sum it up, I consider the place to be a  pretentious dump.",

However, the divider was dusty and a dip tin was left from whomever previously been sitting there. And I was not happy about hearing the entire conversation of our neighbors despite my efforts to focus. The architect/designer probably should consider adding taller dividers.   Our server was capable.. Not particularly friendly but we had no True issues.  As for the food, I ordered a side salad which was large. While nothing special, it was good. Unfortunately, the tomatoes were off tasting and I had to eat around them. For an entre I ordered the meatloaf. If not for the thin barbacue sauce, the meat would have been flavorless. Meanwhile, the broccoli was cooked well (no one likes rubbery veggies) and the whipped mashed potatoes were delicious but could have been warmer.   We would probably try other places before returning, but I would not say no to giving them and another dish a second chance.",

I didn't make a reservation because the last time we met there it wasn't crowded, maybe because the kitchen caught on fire and they couldn't do anything but serve drinks so we drank.  So needless to say it was crowded but the hostesses at the door were very friendly so we all gathered around the seats available and ordered the happy hour specials.  I didn't expect much since they were so reasonable.  Wrong!  Everyone raved on what they ordered, the pulled pork sliders excellent, a couple of us ordered those, Ben ordered the fish tacos, he couldn't rave enough about them! did he share NO! So the next time I will have to try them. The truffle infused French fries very good, not greasy, glad that I got to try them, some ordered some other things on the menu and all were happy with their food they couldn't say enough about what they had... again do you think they offered to share? Not!  Our server was stressed but it was very busy and she was doing a good job  So if you decide to go .. have an open mind, a forgiving heart if everything isn't just your way.. the food was good and I am looking to go back and try other things.
