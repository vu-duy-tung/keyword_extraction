    "text": "It was a last minute decision to get dinner there on a Friday night.  We had been seeing this place every time we were visiting Oakmont bakery and we always wanted to try it.  The place was packed but luckily we found a spot without a reservation.  The greeting service was polite and nice and we were seated immediately.  The atmosphere of the place was great as well - it had a feeling of a past decade upscale dinner (which I love).  The menu has a lot of things to choose from and everything delicious (including the house sauce brought to us with the bread).  The fillet mignon and the sides coming with it (choice was mash potatoes and beans) was great and the beef sandwich was good too.  We will definetely go back.  One thing I wish it was slightly better is the service.  While it is very polite and helpful they are a bit slow!",

Their service is usually pretty good, too.   I'm only giving it four stars because we always make a reservation but almost always end up waiting anyway. The last time we waited over an hour past when our reservation was made for, and there was no room at the bar so we had to wait outside  in the middle of winter. I don't think that's acceptable - especially when the staff at the front was unapologetic. Most restaurants would give a free appetizer or drinks, or at least apologize for the wait.",

The salad is fresh and not boring & I really enjoy the homemade house vinigrette.  My husband always orders the fried zucchini.  It's done to perfection.  Never greasy.  And the marinara sauce that accompanies it is delicious.  Every time we're here at least one of the brother owners is present.  We had them cater our Thanksgiving dinner.  Was expecting good (since you pick it up the day prior & reheat it) not great.  Well, it was GREAT!  Everything was delicious!  The stuffing was out of this world.  So I called about a week before Christmas to have a side or two catered, and they had already reached their order limit.  They are making my augratin potatoes for Easter :)",

The service is pretty good with most of the staff professionals and not \"journeyman\".  I wish the menu was a little more creative, but again it's an italian joint in the burbs' aimed towards the baby boomer crowd.  I like the burgers.  They are usually cooked perfectly and the meat seems to be fresh and not frozen (but, I'm not sure).  The fries are pretty good and I like the fresh vegetables.  I've tried a few entrees', but again the menu doesn't really appeal to my tastes with the majority of entrees' being heavy red sauce dishes.  I've had the blackened filet, which is pretty good quality with a nice balsamic reduction.  I've also tried the Shrimp Monoca wich is about 8 nice sized shrimp cooked simply with butter and garlic.  They give you complimentary cookies after dinner which is a nice touch.  The prices are okay, but maybe a touch higher than they should be for a suburban average restaurant.",

Picture this: you're hanging out with your friends, sipping your second glass of sangria (p.s. stay away from anything with mango vodka in it-- it's disgusting) and out comes the bartender with plates and plates full of pizza and hummus and hotdogs. The bartender sets them down on the bar and you're free to dig into whatever carb you desire...without charge! The friends I was with said that they had breakfast apps last time they visited at the magic hour. This is the only way I'll be visiting Hoffstot's from now on.",

Two waitresses were rude to us all because we had the nerve to ask for a couple tables to be put together. Then, another waitress walked by and rolled her eyes because she had to walk around my Grandmother who was holding her great grandson. None of these ridiculous situations were worse than when the OWNER of the business came by and gave my 90 year old grandmother a completely unnecessary and impolite attitude. No man should speak to a woman the way this man spoke to my grandmother. We were told \"you've been here two hours, I have tables to turn, and you're holding people up.\" ...we had just finished dinner. Literally just finished. The owner is rude and so is his staff. I've worked in customer service for many years and I can tell you that no service person should ever treat anyone the way these people treated us. I, and my family, will NEVER return to this establishment.",

I asked if they had any happy hour specials and he said (with a straight face) \"it's always happy\".  He proceeded to say, \"what do yinz want?\"  I had to ask for a list of wine and cocktails so I could decide because he didn't bring any drink or specialty drink menus to us.  We got the Polish Mules, much like a Moscow Mule but with Belvedere vodka.  He then proceeded to tell us that he had to charge us for each bottle of ginger beer separately.  So, when the bill came we were charged $7.25 for the vodka then there was an upcharge of $3 for the ginger beer?????  When we went to close our bill, we were charged for another full ginger beer but only a small amount was used.  At that point we asked for the bottle of ginger beer to go since we paid $3 for it anyway.  I really want to like this place but I have had the same experience about 4 or 5 times.  I don't feel welcomed, I feel like an inconvenience to the staff (Bobby) How can anyone want to go back to a place that makes happy hour make you feel awful?",

In order for it to be a fillet mignon this secondary muscle(which is full of grissle and UNCHEWABLE) has to be removed.  I also received what is called the head cut.  This is the first cut off of a fillet that is NEVER to be called a fillet mignon. Enough for the steak, it was less than enjoyable.   I also ordered a salad with BLUE CHEESE DRESSING.  The problem here was when they made the homemade dressing they forgot to put the BLUE CHEESE in the dressing or so little there was NO taste of blue.  Blue cheese has the color blue in it, hence the name.  There was NOTHING blue or lumpy in MY dressing.  It tasted like I had a spoonful of thin Hellmans on my salad.  I've had better dressing at Eat n Park.  This was my first and WILL BE my last visit to this establishment.  And my advice to you, DON'T BOTHER find somewhere else.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for a little celebratory dinner after I read an interview with the restaurant's executive chef in a local magazine.  Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed.  We kicked off the experience with some sparkling wine, and our waitress had to find another server to open it, as she didn't know how.  The poor server who came over to help cut her hand on the bottle's wire cage and started bleeding all over.  We had to politely point out to her that there was blood all over the napkin she was using to open the bottle, because she didn't notice.  They took the bottle away and got the bartender to open it, and it frankly grossed me out a bit to go ahead and drink the wine out of it, but I wiped the top with a napkin to see if any blood remained on it, and there didn't seem to be, so we let it go and didn't want to make a fuss.    The bread and oil were good, but I ended up using some of that oil on my salad, since the dressing was flavorless.  We got the cod and chicken pistachio for our main dishes, and I was very surprised to see that the only vegetable preparation they have for their sides is steaming.  The magazine article I read emphasized that the chef sees vegetables as the next big thing, and as a veggie-lover, I expected something really interesting.  Unfortunately, unless you liked the gray, over-steamed brussels sprouts your grandma made thirty years ago, you will be disappointed at all the veggie sides at Hoffstot's.  A more current preparation would be roasting them with olive oil and salt, which is what other restaurants are doing.  I had to send back my chicken because it had literally no flavor whatsoever, and appeared to have been pounded thin and then steamed.  I actually almost grabbed the waitress to tell her she'd brought me fish by mistake, because the chicken had a flaky, fish-like texture.  I took a few bites and tried to like it, but there was just no taste there, only a sea of buttery, flavorless sauce.  I got a side of penne pasta in an equally flavor-free sauce that also went back.  Still hungry, having struck out on the salad, main course, and side dish, I decided to try out dessert.  Their dessert menu says \"Innovative Desserts\" at the top, but every dessert is named \"Old fashioned such and such,\" so that's a bit of a clash.  We tried to order a pumpkin pecan dessert, but the server said they didn't have any.  She said they had some creme brulee for a short time only, as a special dessert, so we ordered that.  It came out looking unlike any creme brulee I've ever seen.  It was covered in strawberries and whipped cream, probably to disguise the fact that it was made far in advance and stored in the fridge, such that there was no \"brulee\" to it.  The characteristic crackly sugar crust had melted and softened, so they should have just called it a baked custard at best, since people usually order creme brulee for the torched sugar crust.  It tasted fine, it just wasn't creme brulee.  We gave in at this point and called it a night.  We won't be back, since the folks running this restaurant seem to be out of date and allergic to flavor.",

I ate it 3 different times, it's that big. (And I'm a big fella.)  The bad: -Pasta Fagioli. Really guys, it was bad. It tasted like someone dumped beans in spaghetti sauce and added water.

But all in all, everything was pretty good.  The service was another story.  Our waiter brought our salads and then what seemed like maybe 5 minutes later, he brought the entrees.  There was no room on the table for all this food which was kind of annoying.  We had coffee and dessert.  Carrot cake and tiramisu.   The carrot cake was great.  The tiramisu was only okay.

The zucchini was really good...it's cut in long wedges and battered to a golden crisp served with marinara. The Reuben's were terrible! Hardly any corned beef atop mounds of cold sauerkraut and barely any cheese or thousand island dressing. The rye bread was thin and soggy. The fries that came with the Reuben were very thin, crisp and tasty. Based on the food I would consider giving them another try...but will not return because the service was HORRIBLE! The waitress was named Darla and we only saw her when she took our order and brought the food. She never refilled drinks or asked us if our meals were okay. She was very rude and short with us despite it not being very busy. I never understand when wait staff can are rude, I mean, come on! That's how you make a living and you do a crappy job?",

The waiter WAS busy fussing over a group of about 8 patrons (larger tip, I guess).   We got up and told the host that we had been sitting for 25 minutes with nothing to show for it.  He seemed extremely uninterested, and we walked out.  As far as the menu...we had plenty of time to study it. Not impressed.  We thought that it was quite boring and lacked creativity (for this community).  The brightness of the dining room was suited for patrons over the age of 70.  It was anything but romantic.  Dimmer switches ought to be in-use.  We did walk down the street to the Chelsea Grill (same owners as Hoffstot's).  We had an excellent meal with an excellent server (Steph).  My experiences with Hoffstot's are always that the waitstaff has a rather lofty opinion of themselves. Pittsbugh is a city in which there are many choices for casual to upscale dining.  As a customer, I NEED to feel as though my patronage is valued if I am to return.  I expect fantastic food and will not accept excuses for poor service.  This will be our last visit to Hoffstot's.....EVER .",

We enjoyed several grilled meat salads, consisting of lots of varied toppings, romaine/spring mix lettuces and housemade dressings. We also enjoyed several chicken based dishes. Sauces were abundant and well spiced and salted. Umami was attended to and treated well.  The patrons span the spectrum: old and young, couples and families, middle aged groups of friends.  Citrus Tea is delightful. Beer prices are very reasonable. Service is great, staff is friendly.  Sit in the bar if you're looking to watch TV's or have a more casual ambiance.  Tables are too close together but if you can snag a booth you'll enjoy both the food and drinks as well as the ambiance.",

Waitress disappeared, never filled the water glasses. Just to get over the new Oakmont bridge it took 30 minutes. My advise, stay out of Oakmont until the bridge is completely open. This place could possible be good if you get a seat in the dining area, otherwise avoid it entirely. Don't think owners care because it looks like a \"gold mine\", so anything else is \"so what\".",

Hoffstots is our familys go to when we have family in town and need a last minute reservation.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. The bar is always packed with locals watching whatever sporting event is on that night.  I always start with the zucchini, it's amazing! The food is predictably good and the menu offers something for everyone. I had the seafood Monaco, it was good, almost overpriced for the amount of crab meat and shrimp. The presentation left a bit to be desired, but the food was good. I always start with the house salad with their vinegarette and dried blue. Love love love their salad.  In previous visits, I've had the eggplant parm, which was really good and enough for two people. I also recommend the beans and greens!  If you're in the area, stop by and check it out. They also do a great lunch!",

This place it absolutely wonderful I have been eating there my entire life and I mean that my family and I ate there every Sunday since I was 1 year old up until I was 15 and we still go there a good bit. The staff is great and attentive the owners are some of the nicest people around. The food is incredible I have never had a bad meal. My favorite is the chicken sultanboca although it is no longer on the menu it can usually be made. On Sunday's they have wedding soup which it out of this WORLD!!!! For desert they sometimes have these incredible almond cookies. This place is the best after returning from my honeymoon my parents asked where we wanted to eat after we left the airport and it was out 1st choice",

The meal started off poorly when then hostess greeted us with, \"table for two?\" with the most disgusted look and tone possible for that question.  She seated us and flatly stated, \"the server with be with you soon\".  Wish that was True.  Took about 7 to 8 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us, let alone bring some waters and take a drink order.  The service was extremely slow and the food was average at best.  The fried zucchini that looked great on another table tasted burned, and it was clear that the oil used for frying had not been changed in quite some time.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and all I could tasted was fried egg that was used to batter the chicken.  It was like eating fried eggs.  My wife ordered the chicken piccata and the sauce was slimy.  The server asked if we wanted our meals, that were half-eaten because of the taste, boxed to go, and we said that we were good and just needed the check.  She was visibly offended and when she brought the check, stated \"have a great night\" in the most sarcastic way possible.  Will definitely NOT go back.  That is two hours of my life I can't get back.",

The Gorgonzola Apple salad was excellent!  The pasta dish with white sauce was excellent!   Service was excellent!   Nice restaurant!  Crowded!   What would make it a 10:  Tables seem a little too close together with the wait staff and customers coming a little too close at times.  Need a little bit more elbow room. It was winter time and alot of people were carrying their big coats.   Overall Score: 9 out of 10",

It's a very quite place with a mostly older crowd on weekdays until around 7pm when the younger crowd picks up. On weekends, it's a constant mix of all ages.  My suggestions: - Eggplant Parmesan - so good and a huge portion. Very good for sharing! I substitute the standard spaghetti pasta with fettuccine Alfredo. - Gorgonzola Apple Walnut salad - amazing, best salad - Beans and Greens - I don't think it's on the menu anymore, though I could be wrong, but it's amazing - Citrus Tea - literally the best drink you will ever have",

By virtue of the way you responded to my nephew ( Sean F. - 5/7/16), yes it was my birthday, you sound like a guilty man.  If it was the case that larger parties are usually concluded after 2.0 hours, don't you think it would have been helpful to let my husband know that information when we made the reservation?  As far as leaving the table to watch the derby, my husband DID tell the young lady when he made the reservation that watching the derby every year is one of our family traditions.  She told my husband that it wouldn't be a problem. It seems like both of those situations could be solved with a little better training.Oh yeah, I wonder who should be doing that?   The final straw was your contemptible response to me when I asked if you cared that you were ruining my 60th birthday.  You said, \" I DON'T CARE, IT'S MY 70TH & I'M MAKING MONEY.\"  So anyone in Yelpland looking to celebrate a special occasion with special people in your life, don't go to Hoffstots in Oakmont. This guy will kick your family out as he did ours. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, this owner wants more. That goes for you, all potential golf professionals & staff from the U.S Open---don't plan a leisurely meal at Hoffstots, the owner will kick you out & won't care how important the day was for you.",

It has very nice ambiance, especially as it is decorated for the holidays with a wreath in the window and tasteful red bows distributed thoughout the place and the tables each have white linens on them.  What is slightly disturbing is the age group all around me -- the over-50 crowd (note that includes myself).  I did notice 2 tables of younger people with children, but in each case they had grandparents in tow.  The problem with this scene is I don't want to be in a place that only attracts the older set; I want a place that is appealing to all age groups.    Regardless, the food was quite good.  I ordered the special recommended by my server, Marie, which was the pork wellington served with a pear and cranberry sauce.  Sounded wonderful and Marie was excited to recommend it.  It was good but the pear and cranberry concoction was barely noticeable.  I also ordered a salad with raspberry vinegarette which was good.  I ordered a glass of Reisling and it came in an ever-so-small glass.  Come on, people -- a grown up glass would have been much better.  And the Reisling wasn't the best I've had for house Reislings.  The price was pretty low so I'd recommend they up the ante and serve a better quality.  Four stars because I really liked the ambiance and it's the first time I've ever had any wellington dish.  I'd come back.",

I was served luke warm, dried out , hard eggplant \"disks\" that were covered with sauce.  The cheese it was topped with didn't even pull apart like fresh cheese should.  I can only believe that it was either previously frozen or yesterdays leftovers.",

I made reservations a head of time so we were seated right away. Our waitress was excellent great service and my drink was always refilled quickly. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the Shrimp Monaco for dinner. The calamari was delicious some of the best I ever had! The pieces were big lightly bothered and melted in your mouth. The house made marinara and mustard sauce that accompanied it were superb.  As for dinner we split the Shrimp Monaco it came with 5 jumbo shrimp with lump crab meat on top. It was just enough for both of us and ended out meal perfectly I will be ordering it again!  Came here again and hit up the early dinner menu tried the Salmon Wellington. It was different but delicious and the price couldn't be beat!",

She had a down to earth personality and took the time to chat with us. She was very attentive with refilling our iced teas and clearing empty plates.   I was going to order the cashew chicken salad, but they were out of it, so I went with the Mini Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. My mom's friend recommended them and they ordered them as well.  The salads we started with were great! They had a little more personality than a typical house salad. They had grape tomatoes, cucumbers, a couple of black and green olives, sprouts, and mixed spring greens. The house made Italian dressing was good.  The crab cakes were nice and light, not heavy with mayo and filler, and were delicately pan fried. They sat on top of sauteed spinach and were drizzled with lemon beurre blanc sauce.   My favorite was the Braised Escarole (greens & beans). I had never tried it before or even heard of it, but I had a few bites of my mom's friend's. Wow! So perfectly garlicky! It's one of my new favorite things!",

This dinner comes with a soup or salad  and what feels like a pound of pasta.I also had a class of the moscato which was very good! From the moment we stepped in the door we were greeted right away! The man and woman greeting us were very friendly. Our waitress Tricia was spot on! Friendly, helpful and witty! At the end of the dinner Tricia brought us these homemade almond cookie treats, they were phenomenal! Thanks hoffstots and Tricia for a wonderful evening, we will be back!",

The chef, Brian, that I worked with was SO extremely friendly, patient, and helpful. I was planning this event from Philadelphia, so I called Brian regularly with questions or concerns. I'm sure he was annoyed with me, but he never once let it show! I can't thank him enough for his professionalism and patience.   When it came to the day of, everything went as smoothly as possible. The two servers that were assigned to us that day were excellent - I wish I had remembered their names! The food was absolutely delicious, and the portion sizes were huge. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better day. The prices were extremely reasonable, also.   Thank you again to Brian and the entire team at Hoffstot's!

It was cooked perfectly with a hint of sweetness. My father had the bourbon pork chops.  They were also excellent paired with the mashed potatoes. The oil for the bread is just amazing with a bit of fresh grated cheese.  I don't often spend over $20 a person on a meal, and Hoffstot's is my go-to when I do because I know my meal will be worth the higher price tag.",

With this many 7s what could go wrong!?  Service was spot on until the entrees arrived. A well-done Mini Blackenzola filet entree was ordered among other entrees and shortly after the entree was brought to the table we discovered the steak was raw on the inside. By the time the waitress returned to bring it to her attention everyone else finished their meals. We showed the steaks to the waitress who apologized and offered to have the steaks cooked as ordered and boxed to-go - we accepted the offer.  Upon unpacking the to-go containers at home we discovered the steaks were still raw on the inside - clearly just transferred from plate to to-go container and not cooked as promised. We have enjoyed the food, service, and culture from the restaurant for so long to have such an off-putting experience.",

I didn't go into the bar area, but it looked large and had many sports channels on the TVs. Our waitress was friendly and for the most part attentive. Before our main meal came out, the host cake around and asked us how our appetizer was. He was very friendly and was able to answer our questions as well. The food itself was very tasty. The pasta pistachio had many wonderful spices, but a lot of spinach. Now, I love a large plate of spinach, but this overpowered the pasta. I left with two containers to go: one for the pasta & one for the spinach so I could add it to pasta I made at home.  We got a cannoli to go and it was okay. Wasn't super flavorful, which was a disappointment from the tasty meal. Overall, great place for socializing or for family meals.

It's outside of downtown in a quaint suburb area near the river, and offers a superb evening meal, plus I got a bonus chatting with a few locals who have been coming here for years!  Moderately priced, expect to spend $15-25pp for dinner entree depending what you select or desire, plus any other courses and drinks. Reservations recommended!  Chose to dine at their bar area tonight (has great friendly service), having an appetizer, salad and entree - it was all excellent I'd give 4.5 rating overall!  Started with house-made meatballs with marinara (tomato gravy); ordered individually, these were plump, very tender to cut with a fork and flavorful!  These could be a meal in itself, or have 'em with pasta.  A highlight of this experience was their fresh, warm bread basket served with a homemade \"dipping\" sauce, consisting of olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, pistachios and a few spices - amazing to me!  They sell this by the jar if interested to take some home.  Caesar salad was traditional, dressing tasty and not overdressed in the salad.  For entree, wanted to have something different, so stayed with the pistachio theme pasta, adding grilled salmon (added expense).  The fusilli pasta was cooked just right, tossed with fresh spinach, tomatoes and pistachios in light oil - this was outstanding.  My one call out was that my salmon was slightly over cooked, so it was tasty but a bit dry.  Overall, wonderful and filling meal!  Topped it off with a scoop of \"death by chocolate\" ice cream, a locally made favorite that was creamy and good.  Check out Hoffstot's Cafe Monaco or their sister restaurant Chelsea's Grill a couple doors away, you won't be disappointed!  ENJOY!!",

They have a decent selection of options for lunch and everything is reasonably priced, especially the drinks. Our service was great. The restaurant space is a bit of a throwback inside which is pretty cool. I had the Coconut Chicken Salad which was fantastic. The chicken was breaded very lightly, the pineapple was great and I loved the vinaigrette they used. Would definitely order it again and would also recommend checking this place out!",

Wait staff was friendly and attentive. But who serves hamburgers on a kids menu & not have mustard? Not someplace I would bring out of town guest to or go on my own. But if I was older & wanted to hang out in a wine restaurant amongst people my own age, this would be the place.",

The server was inattentive, unfriendly and clearly was not interested in taking care of a table for one. The pricing was high and the portions were small. The salmon \"special\" and the grilled salmon were both small and slightly greasy. The side salad was fresh and tasty. The wafer that was presented the first time was so oily that I passed on it the second time. Hoffstot's Mega Salad was good but not worth the ten dollars.  What a disappointment.  There are too many great restaurant in this neighborhood to dine here.",

I was escorted by a dear friend who suggested this place for Greens and Beans!  Terry was fantastic - we had a bit of local bread and sweet and spicy peppers. The pepper were good. The bread was great. When we got the greens and beans - my friend used it like a spread and smeared it on the bread - delicious.   Then I had a great Pittsburgh salad with steak and French fries on top. Terry suggested the Ranch and Italian dressing mixed on the salad - sooo good.   The experience, hospitality and overall quality of food was very good - I shall return.",

    "text": "On Monday night, it was my first time here with my family.  Parking was easy & free.  The place looks much bigger on the outside than it is on the inside.  The restaurant is on the quiet side.  While the dining room arrangement is somewhat cramped, the staff provides the coziness.  (If you have a baby that requires a high chair, beware of a toddler sized table in the back that they may place you at if your family is of small size.  No stars lost because I did request being places farther away from the main entrance so that the baby would not get cold).  I ordered the New England clam chowder and hot stuffed peppers.  My uncle got lasagna & the baby had garlic mashed potatoes.  Every item was WELL SEASONED & PROPORTIONED.  The food and staff totally rock.  We'll be back.  This place needs to like win an award or something.  They have done so many things right.",

I had a green salad with a delicious dressing (i  just wish i had asked for the dressing on the side because the greens were swamped,) the pasta pistachio - great portion size btw - didn't think I would finish it - but apparently i was super hungry! and the amazing dessert definietly the winner of the meal, a delicious chocolate mousse cup with a peanut butter brittle. One thing I would say is that this place is in dire need of an update. A lot of Pittsburgh places that are classics look like they haven't been touched since the 80's or 90's and this is one of them. The price points of the menu's are pretty reasonable though and the bar is absolultey beautiful with huge windows (in a seperate room than the dining area.) I would def recommend coming here!",

Bartenders were friendly & timely in re-filling drinks. I was surprised to see Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap and they seemed to have a decent selection of other craft taps and bottles too. We partook of their early bird special menu (4-6pm), which has quite a large selection of entrees for $12.99. I had the risotto with scallops & a side salad and my husband had pork medallions & asparagus. Everything was cooked to our liking. We got a free fried zucchini appetizer (regular $8.99) thanks to a short term promotion they were having to \"like\" their Facebook page & free zucchini post. We were too full for dessert. Being a Wednesday the place was not very crowded, but it's large inside & accommodates a lot of people. I doubt we'll be back frequently since we live 40 min away, but if we happen to be in Oakmont we'd definitely stop again.",

No complicated over the top presentations here just simple prepared dishes done to perfection. It's how your grandmother would have cooked! The waitstaff are very knowledgeable and efficient and you get quality service without the stuffy attitude that I've seen in the new restaurants in the city.

They need to have more staff for the rushed hours.  However the amount of $12 meals they have during that happy hour hour are well worth it! You can't beat the price.  Most of my family ordered off of the happy hour menu including Parmesan chicken and crab cakes.  I ordered the steak salad and it was just as good as it was years ago!! Another hit at the table was the pork chops. Very large quality of pork chops but more pricey.",

I ordered the little piggy pork chop that came with a salad and a side of pistachio pasta. The garlic, tomato, pistachio sauce on the pasta was perfect. The banana peppery grilled flavor on the pork chop tasted great. I think I ordered this both times I went.  The bread and the oil that comes along with it is fantastic. They should bottle up that sauce and sell it. The seafood pasta had a decent flavor and was loaded with bits of crab, calamari, and clams.. I hunk everyone was satisfied with their meals. The beans and greens made an excellent appetizer as well. This place is a great local spot for a decent meal that will leave you satisfied at reasonable prices. The service was great as well.",
