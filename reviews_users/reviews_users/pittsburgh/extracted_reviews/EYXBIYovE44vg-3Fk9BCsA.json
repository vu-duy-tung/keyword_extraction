However, I guess it is a victim of its own popularity because the wait is frequently over 45 minutes for takeout. Additionally, the last couple of times we have called or driven out there they are not answering their phone or closed. I hope that they figure out a consistent schedule again soon otherwise they might lose their otherwise loyal clientele.",

While the staff assured me that the recipes were the same, on the next two occasions we got take-out, the food had clearly changed. One example was the previously delicious lemon soup was now watery both times. The next time we went, within the posted hours, we were told that they were closing early, no reason given. The staff is completely different, and not very polite. Today I called, a very electronic voice came on and did not identify the restaurant. After double checking that I had telephoned the correct number, I left a voicemail asking to called to be told if they were open. No call came. I live 10 minutes away, but I'll just start traveling a little further and go to Mediterraneo or Ali Baba. May the Greek Stop rest in peace.",

The staff was super friendly, even to my ignorance of the Greek language and what's in many of the foods - I just know it tastes good!  And everything is homemade...all cooked to order!  We opted for take-out. They have a small seating area, but I prefer my privacy at home.  I ordered a mini mixed platter to sample different items. Everything was delicious, even after driving a half hour back home.  My friend ordered a lamb kebab dinner and loved it as well.  I got a piece of baklava for dessert.  It wasn't the traditional style I've always had before, so I was slightly disappointed, but it was still yummy.  I'll definitely be going back here, and telling people about it!",

    "text": "Updating my review: We have been back many times to Greek Stop since earlier review from about 16 months ago. The food is still quality Greek fare. No slacking there, however, last night we went to have a gyro and salad before a concert downtown with plenty of time to spare. We were the only patrons in the restaurant at the time we sat down. We ordered and our salads were promptly served. We were not more than a few minutes into our salads when the hot food arrived way too soon. We felt rushed to hurry and eat our salads so the gyros would not get cold. I think there was a new hostess because the entire 35 minutes we were there she was taking our plates and asking us if we were finished even though salad still remained on the plates. Then even before we had finished she was bringing us the check to which I expressed I'll take that when we are finished eating. Again we felt extremely rushed through our meal. She didn't ask if we would like coffee either. At that point we finished and just wanted to pay our bill and get out. It is a shame because for a quick bite of Greek food it's a great little place. The owner/chef is always pleasant. They just need to slow down and serve the hot portion after salads have been eaten and not rush the entire experience for diners. Get rid of the paper towel napkins as well...tacky. Glad to see you painted over the 'mural' also. We'll certainly be back but next time if we experience the same rushed service we will politely ask them not to serve our hot meal until after salads are finished.",

After our last experience we have no reason to go back, I'll make the trip to Southside to Mike and Tony's for a much better gyro. Our last experience was last Saturday we ordered to go bring our food home.. 3 gyros, just okay at best. The meat wasn't juicy way to crisp around the edges but we microwaved it and ate them anyways.. then on to our salad.. absolutely awful. The spring mix was terrible to the point that many pieces were slime. I contemplated letting this distasteful last Saturday experience go, but Monday I decided to call because we figured maybe the owner wasn't there and should be made aware. I explained to the woman that answered everything, she didn't ask my name or number to even get back to me. She did tell me she will let the owner know, fair. However, not looking for anything free but I have worked in the service industry and a normal place would absolutely want to rectify and satisfy customers especially after giving foul spring mix. Very disappointed with the lack of interest in satisfying customers. No need to go back.",

    "text": "My favorite day of the week is Wednesday.  Why?  Dinner with my kids.  My daughter selected one of her favorite restaurants: The Greek Stop.  We have been here many times and every time we receive great service and great food.   Drinks:  Since it is dinner with the kids, I drank lemonade, which I am convinced is homemade, that is great and I would recommend in a heartbeat.  They do not offer any alcohol, but you can BYOB.  Food:  I ordered the Gyro Platter.  The platter included the gyro, fries, Salad and drink for $14.  Cannot put into words how great the gyros are here but of all things, my favorite item is the Greek Salad.  Plenty of Feta cheese, a few olives, and the best Greek dressing I have ever eaten.  No matter the meal I choose, I have to get the salad.  The other thing I can never pass on when eating here are the honey balls.  If you never have had them, you do not know what you are missing.  They are like donut holes with honey and cinnamon and like everything else, are great here.     Pros:  It is very clean.  The service is prompt and friendly and the food is always spectacular.    Cons:  It is a small place, only 6 tables,  so if you have parties bigger than 4 you have to hope that tables are available to pull together.  Having the good food that they have, they can at times get extremely busy.  There were points of the night where pick up orders had a backlog of 1 hour, so if you're looking to be in and out quickly, you're gambling a little.    Conclusion:  I love this place and so do my kids.  It is always on the short list of places to eat.",

    "text": "Sad to write this review because Greek Stop has been one of my favorites for years.  Over the past few months, however, this place seems to be falling apart.  The service is worse, rude order takers, sometimes its randomly closed, some says they don't answer the phone, etc.  The food has also gotten worse.  The same meal/platter is inconsistent in what you get, the gyro meat is tough and dry, and the fries are soggy and greasy.  2 months ago this place was a solid 5 for a great, local gyro.  Now its mediocre at best.",

    "text": "We finally went to the Greek Stop in Glenshaw for lunch today--on the advice of my wife's fellow library volunteers at the Northern Tier Library.  The Greek Stop's a 25 minute drive from Bakerstown down Route 8 and over Harts Run road to the Saxonburg Blvd. corner Town Center, but it was very well worth the drive!  The food was excellent!  We each got Gyros with fries and a drink, and I got the set with the additional Greek Stop Salad.  Wow!  The salad was huge, and the dressing was so delicious that we ordered a cup to take home, along with leftovers of the salad which we had both shared.  The fries and Gyros were in such large helpings that for lunch we wound up with enough food to take home for supper!  And you couldn't have gotten better fries, as they were nicely crisp and delicious (I told the chef they blow some other fries we've had right out of the water).  The Gyros were the best we've ever had.  I could compare them easily to the ones I used to get for lunch at the little Greek take-out shop in Princeton, and these Gyros were not only as good, but were even bigger yet!  The only wee complaint my wife had was that though the tzatziki sauce was fine, she would have liked a more on her Gyro.   I started off with a cup of Avgolemono soup--a delightfully gentle lemon flavored rice and chicken soup which I shared with my wife so she could see what it tasted like.  We liked it enough to order up 2 nice bowls worth to take home for supper. Although the Greek Stop appears to be nothing fancy, it's clean and bright inside, the food is delicious, the waitress and chef were very cheery and helpful, the service was fast--we had our drinks and soup immediately and the rest of our food in minutes and, though small, the place was very comfortable.  We'll certainly be back--it's now on our short list of great places to eat!  Next time we'll try for supper some evening.   Incidentally, the place also seems to do a lot of take-out as there were people in and out all the time we were there eating lunch along with the other singles, doubles and triples who were there for lunch while we were.  A great spot all around, it appears!",

    "text": "This place was recommended to my boyfriend by a local dentist office and this was a great recommendation.  My boyfriend said that the take out service was very efficient and he was pleased with the customer service.  I got home about a half hour after he brought the food home and it was still fresh and not soggy.  I had the lamb gyro, and it was absolutely wonderful.  There was a lot of meat on the gyro and was definitely worth the $7 or $8 that my boyfriend spent.  The meat was well seasoned and very tender.  There could have been a bit more tziki sauce on it, but it was still really good.  If I go next time, I will ask for some on the side.  We also had the humus and pita which was very fresh, and I loved the red bell peppers in it.  I can tell this place is going to be my new go to for gyros!!",

The dates tasted like they sat in the refrigerator for a week.    Service was good and that's the 2 stars.  Had to make a trip to Mike and Tony's for redemption and it was awesome.",

    "text": "Preface: We're loyal Mike & Tony's customers!  My girlfriend and I got takeout, for the first time, Tuesday evening. Being first-timers, we decided to try a bunch of different items. Our order consisted of two of the \"Olympic sized\" (extra meat) lamb gyros, chicken gyro, mini-Grecian platter, a full size order of the stuffed grape leaves and the spanakopita. All of the food was really good and we plan on getting it again, but Mike & Tony's is still our favorite. The only negative thing that I can say is that the prices are on the high side. For example, $11 for the Olympic sized gyro is a bit much to ask, in my opinion, when Mike & Tony's lamb gyro with extra meat is just $7.25. The one thing that it has over Mike & Tony's is the proximity to said girlfriend's house.",

Oh... and the most amazing roasted red pepper soup I've ever had (and red pepper soup is my fave!!).   Greek Stop has been a once-a-week meal since we found it. :) Take out is pretty quick and packaged so nothing is soggy when you get home. Highly recommend!",
