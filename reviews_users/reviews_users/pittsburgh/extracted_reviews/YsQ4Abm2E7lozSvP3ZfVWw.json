Nice relaxed atmosphere and easy to get comfortable in decor. The food was excellent. Select cut Delmonico and truly perfect crab cakes. Generous size and no breading, just pure lump crab. My only complaint was that I like a traditional remoulade sauce and the chef serves a mustard based sauce. After hearing my request of our server, the owner came to the table and gave me his card. He said when I call and make reservation in the future, to request remoulade and they will have it waiting for me. Now how great is that ?!?!",

As soon as we (my mom and I) came in the door the staff politely greeted us and brought us two a nice little booth. Throughout the entire course of the meal, the staff was attentive and proactive in checking on us to see if we were satisfied or needed any refills as well. And now I'll talk about the food.   Here's what my mom thought: The Italian meatball soup was amazing and so filing. Also had the largest chicken Caesar salad which was also amazing. And to top it off a nice White Russian hit the spot. Great place, great food and wonderful service and staff! A must if you're visiting Sewickley!!!    My thoughts: I really just had a mixed greens salad which was pretty good, but I'm not really used to all that high class stuff. The Italian Chicken Breast I had was EXCELLENT! You know food is cooked well when you can taste each of the ingredients playing off one another, and I definitely could with this one!   Overall, the service, food, and atmosphere were amazing!!",

Main meals were good, but not as creative as the menu would have you believe. One of us got the filet and she was happiest. The shrimp and sausage was basic. The crab and angel hair was good, but way over priced for what it was. The atmosphere was fine, if a little plain.

    "text": "So, I heard great things about 424 Walnut, which is why we decided to go there for my birthday dinner this year. It was not so great.  We got the halloumi and vegetables, they were good, although a little burnt.  I got the scallops which came with potatoes, salad, and broccoli slaw (cooked)  The first scallop was fine, it tasted good, good texture, the second made me gag. Something was wrong with them. I didn't eat any more than the one and 1/4. My stomach was upset for the rest of the night, and I just opened the togo container and it smells like something died in there.... No bueno  The broccoli slaw was literally the kind of broccoli slaw they sell at giant eagle, cooked, and completely a mushy mess. GROSS  The potatoes were so salty I thought I would choke on them.  The salad was blah. I wish the waiter would have told us that we could choose from the other salads, but he only told that to the table behind us after we had ordered.  The key lime pie was delish, but not good enough to make up for the terrible other food.   Oh and on another note. I was served my dinner and had to ask for a fork 3 times before someone actually remembered to bring me one.",

    "text": "424 walnut was way out of my comfort zone. Not because of the cuisine, but because it was in Sewickley! Sewickley to me is like Peru; far away and foreign. But we were meeting so family, so we braved the highways and bridges.   We started with the crab stuffed artichokes. It comes in a lemony butter sauce and bread it dip. I love bread. And I love lemony butter sauces. And I really love bread in lemony butter sauces. I could have happily slurped that right outta the bowl.   I went with something just on the cusp of daring for my entree and ordered the chicken and penne. It was chicken with basil and prosciutto in a tomato cream sauce. It was so gooooood. The BF got the veal which came with veggies and some sort of potato. Veal not being one of my favs, I didn't try it, but considering the way he cleaned his plate with bread, I'll go ahead and say he loved it. Carla got the surf and turf which came with a crab cake and a steak the size of my head, and for those of you who don't know, I got a big ole' head! The steak was a pretty pink medium and fantastic. I didn't try the crab cake but she said they are wonderful. Matt, a True natural born raconteur, got the lamb shanks with prawns. That was one thing I found amazing about the menu; you could get things from a chicken salad or burger, to veal piccata to lamb shank with prawns. And everything was done well and delicious. In my experience, that's not easy for a restaurant to do.   For the finale we got a key lime pie and bread pudding, for the table. I didn't try the pie, but the BF said it was phenomenal. The bread pudding, which I insisted I was too full to eat but then ate quite a bit of, was equally as phenomenal.  On the ride home the BF said we should take a ride about and try it again, which for homebodies like us is the best review a place can get.",

    "text": "I've been here once as a destination for dinner and once as a final stop in a progressive dinner for dessert.  I don't recall what I ate the first time, only that my friend and I were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed the atmosphere and the meal.  And please don't mistake that for an underhanded compliment; it's just that neither of us had eaten there before and didn't know anyone else who had either, so we had little to no expectation.  The more recent visit for dessert blew me away.  I didn't eat dessert last time, but in my quest for somewhere in Sewickley where we could get it, 424 was the only place that I was confident in having some sort of offering because, strangely, not a lot of the restaurants in this town do.  Anyway, we took a seat and asked after the desserts, and were pretty blown away by the selection, the fact that most (maybe all) were made in-house, and then when ours came out, they were incredible. We both had cheesecakes, my friend opting for the marscapone and I for the peanubutter chocolate.  Mine was so good, it was all I could do to stop halfway and bring the rest home for another evening, because the slice was quite generous.  As for the atmosphere, it's nice.  There's a bar, and everything is in a dark-stain wood.  The restaurant cuisine skews Italian/Mediterranean, and it's nicely done.  I think that perhaps it suffers a tiny bit from being a little off the beaten path--that is to say, not right on the main drag of Beaver or Broad St.  But that shouldn't deter anyone, really.  I'll keep this in mind the next time I'm looking to go out for a sit-down meal in the Village.",

Some of the restaurant staff have an air that they are somewhat more impressive than they really are, but the diner holds the real truth. They have strong variety in their menu set, and a caring manager/owner who made a personal visit to our table, but I felt that they are still a less than median value for the money.",

We walked in to celebrate a special nite and was going to leave because it was a touch loud but we were convinced to stay. We were seated in a booth that somehow did eliminate the noise! The waiter, Paul, really knew his stuff, was personable, I can't say enough positive about how he took care of us.   Had the wild mushroom soup and meatballs to start. Lamb, prime rib , crab cakes main course. And I think it was a caramel cheese cake for desert. All very tasty.   424 walnut has both service and food perfect.",

We had a hard time choosing entrees because EVERYTHING looked so good.  We had the stuffed banana peppers for starters. It was stuffed with veal and had the most authentic Italian sauce....I wanted to eat it all day. The soup special was a cream crab and sausage which was such perfection that I asked if the chef could make it in batches for take out. Literally, the best soup I've ever had.  We followed that by the duck confit salad with strawberries and balsamic. The duck was cooked perfectly! Next we had the charred Delmonico...again, cooked to perfection. At this point the owner comes over to talk to us and I was impressed with his love and passion for food. He said \"If I give someone an amazing dish they will be loyal to me forever.\"  He was right, I am in love with this food! Before we left, stuffed to the gills, he brought us a piece of the -housemade- Blackberry, Chocolate, Chambord cheesecake. At that point I decided that the next visit was going to be a dessert tour of 424 Walnut. Yuuuum. Well done. Well done.",

Once we were seated it took the waitress a decent amount of time just to come and take our drink orders. Trying to have a conversation is hard because the noise from the kitchen is so loud even though we were seated all the way across the restaurant by the windows, so it shouldn't have been a problem, but all we heard were dishes banging together. I ordered soup, and a salad, and my boyfriend ordered the fish sandwich. The soup, salad, and his dinner were all brought at the same time. Thankfully I had a salad as my entree or I would've had a cold dinner. They did not bring any dressing for my salad, nor did they bring him the extra cocktail sauce he asked for. The chicken, and potato wedges in my salad were so salty I couldn't eat them. They were truly awful.  The waitress was not attentive enough to check and find out if we needed anything so I ate most of my salad with no dressing. The flavor of the soup wasn't bad, but they left the bay leaves in there whole, and I had to keep spitting them into my napkin.  Unfortunately, not one time did our waitress come and ask how things were.  I guess the next time I go into a restaurant and the table near me is complaining about the service I'll take that as good advice and not eat there. I suggest going ANYWHERE else.",

This time, no luck but I'm still happy with the selection. No real cocktail list and I was told they're working on creating a wine list. There is supposedly a list on the chalkboard by the bar but it isn't legible at all. I stuck with beer because they have a list that is legible.  I ordered the queen size prime rib (HUGE) medium rare (a special on the menu) with a sweet potato and French onion soup to start. The French onion soup was pretty good. Be sure to ask for some bread on the side. They have a tasty sourdough excellent for dipping.   I have always received excellent service here. Our waiter was pretty nice. The owner, Joe, is great. Had a conversation with him. Very attentive. I would definitely come back and invite a couple of friends!!! Hidden gem.",

The service received today falls into this category. I have had more enthusiastic service at  McDonald's.  Today's service fell short for the following reasons or voids.  Not greeting your customers.   Not taking the beverage order within a reasonable amount of time .  ( Avoid reacting negatively when alcohol is not chosen)  Do not act annoyed if you are asked to repeat the descriptions of today's specials.  No apology for a seemingly soiled napkin that was asked to be replaced.  Not following up with your table to see if anything else was needed .  No offer for desserts, more water etc..  Service was the ho hum of my 1st outing here. Bare basic.  However, food, atmosphere,  portion size, and dining  companions were fantastic with a capital F.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped here for lunch. We were seated immediately and received exceptional service. The restaurant has a full bar on one side as well as table and partial booth seating. Upon our waiter's recommendation we went with the open faced crabcake sandwich with a cheese topping and a bowl of French onion soup.  This is one of the better French onion soups I've had in a while. It had parsley in it to bring out the flavor. The crabcake was real and you have a choice of either French fries or coleslaw. We both chose the latter and believe me it was delicious!  While they offer a daily soup/half sandwich combination on the menu they weren't doing this on the day of our visit since they had a special soup of the day and extended menu offerings.  They have one gender neutral restroom and no free WiFi. Located on Walnut St in Sewickley metered street parking is available.",

You must try their soup of the day as our waiter advised that this was what the resteraunt was known for. We had the shrimp bisque and it was delicious.   My husband loved his chicken risotto, although I did like my salmon better.  Save room for dessert, because they are all made in house . The mascarpone cheesecake was amazing, thanks to our great waiter for the recommendation.    We would come back here in a heartbeat.  The only thing that was a little distracting was the constant flickering of the lights, but the food was amazing !",

My son had the chicken salad sandwich that he devoured and I very much enjoyed the crab salad wrap. French fries were crispy and delicious and while I appreciated the heirloom tomato wedge on the field greens salad, it definitely could have benefited from the addition of any other vegetables. The lonely cucumber slice and tomato wedge made it more of a giant pile of field greens as opposed to a salad. Heck even some seeds or something would have been greatly appreciated. But at least it wasn't iceberg lettuce!!  Decor is lovely, I feel like they've remodeled since the last time we visited? It's a very enjoyable place for lunch.",

I ordered the special lamb shank that was so tender and melted in your mouth!  It was served over a creamy and flavorful mushroom risotto that was the perfect accompaniment to the lamb.  Great meal - would definitely come back!",

Walked around the building on a snow/ice packed sidewalk to get to the rear door. Greeted by a dumpster and smoking employees. Asked why no front door entrance and was told it lets too much cold air into the space. Hmmm, curious. 5 other people in the restaurant but was told by the server that they were surprised we were even seated. Said there were 104 reservations for the hour between 5-6. Hmm, ok. Daily special insert included in the menu was dated for yesterday. When I asked I was told they use the same specials on Friday and Saturday. Hmm, not what the special list indicated. Service, quality of food was average. Next time I decide to have a spontaneous dinner, it will be elsewhere.",

    "text": "I occasionally have business meetings in Sewickley so I figured I'd try this place out for lunch while I was there. It was rated well on Trip Advisor and appeared to have a good menu.  PROS: Nice atmosphere and comfortable seating, especially at the high top bar area tables. The steak salad and seafood soup was delicious.  CONS: I was the first patron to walk in on a Friday at 11:15. They open at 11. The owner or manager was at the hostess station and did not acknowledge me (he actually has his back to me upon entering and standing there) as he was busy fiddling around with his phone. The bartender finally came over and seated me. The waitress was nice, but it took awhile to get her attention to actually have her take my order; at least 10 minutes and by this time there was only ONE other table of three people in the entire restaurant. My food came and she was nowhere to be found so I had to ask the bartender for silverware. Really? That should have been placed when I was seated. The service was a bit slow considering another waitress was added during lunch time and only a few other tables of people were now seated. There is also only one bathroom and apparently the lock sticks as I heard while I was using the facilities and a man kept pulling on the door despite me stating, \"someone is in here.\"  I think it is overpriced for what you're getting, especially if you go at lunch time. I might go back.",

We did want wine and even tried to hail her down for a second round during meal but she was too engaged in conversations behind the bar with fellow employees so we had our second round at home after. We had an amusing situation with the \"garden\" salad. It was a handful of mixed greens plunked down without being torn up, one cherry tomato, one black olive, and one cucumber slice . I ordered a \"vinaigrette\" but it was just vinegar that pooled at the bottom of the plate. (You need a binding agent like oil so the dressing clings to the lettuce. And a little seasoning is also nice.) I ate a little but wasn't in to it. The host/manager(?) tried repeatedly to make up for it, which I appreciated. I feel bad to say this but honestly my overall impression of the restaurant was everybody except this one fellow really didn't care a whole lot.",
