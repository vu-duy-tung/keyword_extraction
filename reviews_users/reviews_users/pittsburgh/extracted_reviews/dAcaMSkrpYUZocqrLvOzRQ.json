    "text": "I love Mexican so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I had four different soft tacos and rice/beans.  I had a ground beef taco, garlic shrimp, shredded pork, and carne asada.  The shredded pork was by far my favorite and that Is not my favorite style, but it was very tasty.  I enjoyed the garlic shrimp with the exception of the creamy sauce that was poured on top.  Without the sauce it may have had a lot of potential.  The ground beef and carne asada were OK.  The same goes for the rice and beans.  Chips and salsa were slightly above average.  The young lady behind the counter was very courteous.  This is not a must go to place, but not bad if you are in the neighborhood.",

I'm glad they lost the Styrofoam plates since the last time I visited, but they still use Styrofoam cups which is kind of a turn off for me as far as restaurants go.   However, as others have noted, their service is great and the employees are very friendly. And they offer free chips. Unfortunately, their great service is not enough to make me want to go back. Unless, of course, it's late on a Friday or Saturday night and I'm looking for some greasy food to satisfy my drunken appetite.",

I came in at around 1:45 with my friend hoping that they wouldn't have started locking up as most places do when its starts to drag toward the end of the night. I waved in at the guy inside he said the were open (YAY)  The menu is a little overwhelming but there are tons of options to choose from. I don't even remember what I had because I told him to surprise me and then I covered my ears when my friend ordered the same thing.   Ill post a picture of that monstrous delicious burrito. With C.A. written on in sour cream.  It was soooooo good.  Definitely stop by if you're a late night person like me or just hungry from a long night of bar hopping.",

They are very nice and great service.  and AND they are open till after the bars close on Saturday nights.

    "text": "Pittsburgh is definitely not well known for its Mexican cuisine.  However, Los Cabos is one of the best and is certainly worth your visit. I've been back in Pittsburgh for a few months now, but tonight was the first time I had heard of, noticed, and tried Los Cabos.  Will I go back?  Absolutely.  At a friend's suggestions, I ordered the beef Chimichanga.  And a soda.  I was told that the Chimichanga was going to be huge, so no appetizers for me.  The staff was very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be on the job.  Once we ordered and sat down, we were given chips and salsa to munch on while we waiting.  That  was a nice perk.    Food arrived a plate or two at a time (there were 6 of us), but that wasn't a huge issue.  My food was last to arrive and when it did come, I was shocked at how huge my $7.95 Chimichanga was.  And man was it tasty.  I couldn't finish it, although it was begging me to finish.  Now I'm not only completely full and satisfied, but I also have lunch for tomorrow.    Go try Los Cabos.  And order the Chimichanga.  Do it.",

Aside from that George (Jorge) the new owner has worked hard to own this piece of an authentic Mexicali  franchise.  My personal recommendation is the combo \"with one extra\" -- cheese enchilada, rolled tacos and the tamale.  Also, don't overlook the pollo floutas!!  A special request, but it's my favorite at a restaurant such as this.  Great salsa.  Mix the hot and mild for a real treat!

    "text": "I try not to make concrete judgments about restaurants in their first year of operation; the learning curve in the industry is steep and lots of things will be changing in those first 365 days (I also try to visit a place more than twice before reviewing it-we all have bad days). With that in mind, Los Cabos, which has been around for a month or two, hasn't blown me away. But that doesn't mean they won't someday.  For now though, my friend nailed it when he said, \"They aren't solving any of the problems with the Mexican food scene in Pittsburgh,\" after having a \"meh\" burrito there.*     Two thing at Los Cabos make it feel slightly more authentic than other popular Mexican restaurants like Round Corner Cantina or Mad Mex; free chips and salsa (always nice) and horchata (a deceptively simple rice milk drink with cinnamon and sugar--otherwise known as heaven on earth in its best versions, which isn't to be found here).   Do chips and a tasty aqua fresca elevate this place to a level of authenticity thus unparalleled in the Iron City? Hardly, but their tacos are pretty good.  One pork belly taco will run you around $3, which is kind of crazy considering that's more expensive than the ones you get in the touristier Strip at Reynas, but these ones are way better. The pork belly was a little more belly fat than pork, but the flavoring was knock-out, as was the seasoning on the pollo, and carne asada. And they were mostly meat. Yay!  The walls are a disorienting mix of deep purple, bubble-gum pink and sunshine yellow. I usually like the way over-saturated colors kind of automatically lift my serotonin, but bad lighting make the restaurant feel dim overall. There's not much in the way of decorations, but the wall as you walk in features a big ass menu that's so expansive it would make Lewis and Clark think twice. So, again, although tacos are the litmus test for Mexican restaurants in my mind, I'm not going to pretend like Los Cabos and I won't be meeting again, and again, and again.  *Let it be known that I think there are plenty of awesome Mexican restaurants in PGH, but that there's also lots of room for improvement: restaurateurs, are you listening?!",

Although the place looks like one of those Chinese take-out places, but the food content is pretty amazing. When you first walk in, you have to place your order at the counter. They'll then delivery it to your table. Although my fiance didn't get the nice cozy sit down place that he was expecting, the food made up for all the difference!  We tried their Pittsburgh burrito and the chicken house special (i think it was Carne Asada with Chicken). While we waited, they served us a bowl of chips/salsa, it was nothing special, but it was free food!!  We were shocked by the portion of the food when it came out - they were very generous! As for the taste, granted it's not the same as a fancy/expensive restaurant, but it was still pretty tasty/yummie for the price. I definitely consider as some good comfort food, especially on a SUPER COLD winter day. The burrito was made Pittsburgh style (with fries)! With the sauce they added, it was very delicious. As for the chicken, they used white meat, but it was also surprisingly tasty and it wasn't dry! Wrapping it in a tortilla shell, I was able to make my own tortilla!  If you want some fast but good tasting Mexican food, go give this place a try IF you're looking for a romantic date, then this is not the right place for you.",

I emblazoned an item of my clothing with a taco... a hand stitched taco... yeah.  When I heard that a new Mexican restaurant was opening in my neighborhood I was so stoked I did a little dance. (Just as an fyi: the dance usually involves me shaking my butt and jumping up and down from one leg to the other. If you want to picture it please enjoy yourself at my expense.)  My first experience with them wasn't so stellar though. I stopped on my way home and picked up two shredded chicken burritos and a single beef taco. I walk everywhere and by the time I got home with my food purchases: 1. The awful giant styrofoam containers were all broken and sauce like liquid was leaking out of them. & 2. The burritos were sort of... squishy? I don't know if that's the right word. They were... mushy. That's it. They had just been too drenched with sauce. They still tasted great though and both my boyfriend and I loved it. Not to mention they're so big they're two meals for me.  My second/third/fourth (you get the idea) trips have been great. We've been trying different burritos and I'm about ready to move onto some combo plates, horchata, and tacos.  The girl working the front is (beautiful) always incredibly friendly and the interior is cheerful, bright, and clean. My only disappointment is that they're not open Sundays for my Mexican brunch fix.",

The people working there are super friendly, it is byob with a six pack shop just down the street, and if that's not enough the food is phenomenal. The menu is exactly like what you would find in San Diego, down to the horchata and carne asada fires.  If you dont know what to get, start with the California burrito.  You cant go wrong with meat and potatoes.  Also, I highly recommend any burrito with fries in it, the chimichanga, and shrimp ceviche.  Come hungry though, the portions are substantial and you will inhale the free chips and salsa they give you while you're waiting for food.",

After 2+ years of being open, the \"Now Open\" sign is STILL on the front of the restaurant. You would think they'd invest in a neon sign if they have any plans to stick around.  Their food quality has gone down significantly since they first opened, and their hours have been cut - this eliminates a lot of business that comes from the late-night Brillo crowd.   In terms of their food, eat vegetarian there. Anything with pollo asado is dry and flavorless. The carne asada usually full of gristle and fat. The carnitas are alright. Funny enough, the chorizo is the only meat I would trust, since it doesn't come from Sysco. Even if you avoid meat dishes here, the veggie burrito can be hit or miss. When it's good, it's got tons of colorful sliced veggies. When they're hitting the bottom of the veggie pile, the veggies are really on their way out. Can't be serving rotten food to paying customers, no matter how drunk they are.  That said, the fish tacos are pretty great. Slather it up with Tapatio, and you've got some serious flavor!

Some Tapatio fixed the problem. Also, fries and tartar sauce, a \"pittsburgh\" burrito does not make. The place claims to be so-cal mexican food, and indeed the waitress's truck had a california plate on it - so they seem to be doing alright.   They also have Carne Asada fries, which was something I thought was cool on the west coast that I hadn't seen here. My girlfriend coerced a meatless version off of the late-night menu which was really delicious - if they fix the sacrilegious pittsburgh burrito and  the yinzers ever find out about nacho fries then Los Cabos will be the mexican Primanti's in no time...

Still, I mostly rate a place on the quality of the food and it was decidedly subpar. I tried three different tacos here: chicken, pulled chicken, and carnitas. They were all certainly edible, but the tortillas ruined the experience - they were tough and greasy.  On the plus side, the complementary chips and salsa were decent although the salsa wasn't very hot.  If I try this place again, I will probably avoid the tacos and try something else.",

He then brought me some habanero and some really good cilantro sauce.   It's not the best Mexican I have ever had but probably the best I have had in Pittsburgh.

    "text": "This place is certainly three stars in my book, but I plan on coming back.  The first time I got the carne asada chips/nachos.  I was pretty excited about the concept of steak and melted cheese served on chips.  Unfortunately, the blandness of the beans canceled out the delicious marinade of the carne asada; leaving me with a pretty bland dish since there wasn't anything else on the enormous platter to kick things up a notch.  They did a decent job on the quesadilla--so far the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  They actually put some flavor in there and crisped up the tortilla.  Most recently I got the chimichanga, which was a big step up in flavor compared to the carne asada chips.  It wasn't quite as crispy or overflowing with cheese like I'm used to with my TexMex favorite, but it was pretty respectable.  Peppers, delicious marinated beef, and pico made this a worth while adventure.  In the end, the food is good enough that I would come back--maybe during lunch hour--but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to take an out of town guest there.  And Yelp, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD COMMON MEXICAN FOOD TERMS TO YOUR SPELL CHECK?",

I kept trying to tone down the salt by piling sour cream and extra guac (I ordered an extra side) but it was just so bad.   I gave up and threw the burrito away.  The side of refried beans was watery and gross - the kind you can get out of a can is better.   I ended up layering the beans, guac, sour cream and salsa and eating it as a dip with chips.  Mixed together it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good.   With all the great reviews on here, I'm really surprised that this is the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten (Sorry :-( but it's True)  If you want good Mexican, go to Patron, Emiliano's, Cuzamil, Mad Mex, El Burro, pretty much anywhere else.",

It seemed to lack basic seasoning.  The rice was okay until I added salt then WOW it was delicious.    I ordered the rolled tacos and was disappointed with the guacamole that came on top.  It seems they decided to use the avocados that are more commonly found here on the East Coast (I guess?) where they generally lack flavor and are a lot cheaper than Haas avocados.  Tsk-tsk.  Don't give up flavor for money!    Also ordered carne asada tacos which were pretty darn tasty.  I would recommend ordering anything with carne asada as they clearly know how to cook their meat.   The cost was a little pricier than I would expect in California but right around what taco shops seem to charge here.    I would come back and give the carnitas a try.  Vegetarians/Vegans: The rice and beans are all vegetarian.  They also have a veggie burrito which comes with rice, beans, and some vegetable medly which includes carrots and zucchini.  I didn't try it but it sounded interesting.  For the owners: Maybe you should consider staying open until 2am.  It's right next to brillobox and I would love to one night stumble out of brillobox and stuff my face with a burrito.",

This place is that So-Cal Mex done perfectly, filling my rather pathetic size self with a burrito larger than any (and have been doing so for at least the last five years). I used to even trek here from the South Hills for my shredded chicken before moving to the East End. A pilgrimage from a south 'burgher is rare. Between the family running the place that is constantly here with sincere, friendly service, and the enchilada sauce (yes, seriously, just this sauce by itself), you can't get better.  Enchilada sauce. I could live off this stuff. I've had enchiladas elsewhere and been like, cool, tomatoes. But this! Red gold. It covers the huge, tender shredded chicken burrito that shares its huge shell with corn, lil' peps, rice, green beans, and is totally finished by me every time.. and these are massive. Those shredded burritos are under the radar it seems.  Everyone else gets the beefy Pittsburgh burrito, which I have to salute if only for the use of french fries.  You also get to begin your meal with their salsa and chips, and while free, are also some of the best. I do think they make everything themselves and will not believe any word otherwise. My only draw back is trying to stop by for late night, and they are often already closed before the listed hour. Maybe I just like the chase.. The elusive burrito. Good to note a few of the local food delivery services will also drop off your puppy sized lunch to the surrounding neighborhoods.  I can't compare it to others anywhere in the area (maybe a joint or two while living in AZ, but that's a given). Not saying Western PA is a hot spot for Mexi, but we hit a gold mine here. This is a Penn Ave sauce covered gem.",

Go through my reviews and you'll see years old reviews about my favorite carne asada fries joints. Seriously, trust me on this one.)  You know how Mad Mex says they're \"CaliMex\"? Psht NO. THIS is what mexican food in SoCal tastes like. I was so happy and impressed that I asked to meet the owners. They were so sweet and happy to talk with me.   Also, their Chile Relleno is legit. I always judge my Mexican restaurants by their Chile Rellenos. It should be a poblano pepper stuffed with gooey hot cheese, battered and fried in a fluffy coating, covered again with cheese, and smothered in red sauce. Los Cabos hits this on every point.  Expect authenticity, expect a lot of spice, expect a divey feel (bc that is authentic and best), and expect yummy greasy food.  Also, BYOB!",

I have a starvation migraine!\"  I had suddenly been put on the spot! I did remember that a Mexican restaurant had recently opened across from where St. Francis Hospital (my former employer) used to be, and I hadn't been there yet (blame Yelp!), so to Penn Avenue we drove.   After finding a safe spot on the street, we walked over to find something that came off as a Taco Bell given a massive, upmarket upgrade.   They've also crafted the zenith of taco salads in what they call the Los Cabos Supreme Tostada.   It is everything SoCal Mexican inside a flaxen and flaky tostada basket, just like many a chain makes, and not a single component, from the guacamole, crema, and shrimp to the ground beef skipped a beat or was wasted. If you are short on dough, split this with someone, and you'll both come away from it stuffed as well as gratified. I needed nothing else to go with it.   With such south-of-the-border fare in Pittsburgh, I must say to Taco Bell...well, I'll just let James and his pals push the clapper at the top of the cathedral for me...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRPT88R0mjwU&s=12f725059368a75e405e730d150a374a1b22c8e4462b73b96305082ed6a46e18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=RPT8...</a>",

It's served on a large oval dish/platter, with french fries at the bottom (which is, I understand a mexican socal thing) and oodles to yumminess on top: minced grilled/cooked steak, onion, lots of cheese, guac, salsa, and crema.  Maybe some lettuce?  Anyway, it's one of those dishes you eat and eat and eat and don't make a dent in.  I have yet to finish one, and I always go in with an appetite.  So it's really a lunch for today and a meal for later.  For $8.25 it is a steal.  You still get those homemade chips and salsa (the leftover I spooned onto the carne asada) and with a drink it's about 12 bucks with a tip.  Can't go wrong.",

The menu is huge with lots of your favorites peppered in with some very Americanized accents (burrito's with fries inside, holy American batman!).  I choose the shrimp burrito.  Here's the key to a fantastic shrimp burrito, and it's a simple one.  Don't scrimp on the shrimp!  Good thing they know me (they don't) because it was PACKED with big juicy shrimp!  Not even those puny frozen kind, the real deal!  I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with the shrimp, plus rice, beans and cheese.  Delicious!    But I must admit the star of the show for me was the guacamole.  Gauc seems like it would be so simple to make yet it's so easy to mess up.  Too mushy, no taste, etc.  This gauc was the real deal!  It was probably the best gauc I've sampled at a Mexi restaurant in the city!  There, I said it!  I'd come here just to sample some chips and gauc if I was craving it (or not craving it and just loving it!).    I'm also currently in love with the Jarritos Pineapple Mexican soda drink, which they carry.  So I'll be grabbing me a soda and gauc here in the near future, don't you worry!!",

The fish in the fish taco was pretty dinky sized and mostly fried breading.  You can't really mess up fish tacos though, so taste wise it was fine.  Shredded cabbage and a lot of sauce.  Combo plate again was on the small side and just ok.  Chips were pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the salsa.  It was pretty thin and a little bit tangy/sweet?  I couldn't quite place the taste, but i wasn't a huge fan.  It wasn't horrible.  It was just kind of disappointing and kind of overpriced.  Perhaps we ordered wrong.  If we ever give it another try, I think we'll go with the Carne Asada fries and burrito.",

The salad in question is the Surf Salad - a combination of grilled mahi mahi, shrimp, avocados and so much deliciousness.  Each bite was better than the last.  Get the dressing on the side - fifty bucks says you won't even touch it; the salad is that good alone.  My mum ordered the fajita salad with steak and was equally impressed with hers.   So - BYOB, amazing food and delightful/fast service.  I'm not sure what else to say. Can I become an investor in Los Cabos? Can I marry the cook? Can I move in upstairs?  Eh, I guess I'll just settle for dining here as often as humanly possible.  Da-a-a-mn.",

I love Mexican food but this tasted kind of bland. It wasn't cheap, greasy Mexican food. My enchiladas didn't seem cooked enough and the beans were not well-flavored. I've heard that the tostada salad is an excellent deal with a lot of food and a fine flavor. However, as a vegetarian, I probably won't be back.",

For what it's worth, Taco Bell has better food and this place makes chipotle look like fine dining. There is a major lack of flavor.  Everything was dry and bland.  I asked for a side of rice and beans and they put it inside the burrito.  The $12 overpriced overfilled burrito looked so sad all alone on the plate.   Seriously who charges $12 for a burrito with no sides?  It's also worth noting they don't serve alcohol, and Mexican without beer should be a crime.  My co worker ordered a combo platter and although it looked good he also complained of a lack of taste.    I know I'll never return here and I'd suggest you pass as well.",

This has happened to be on multiple occasions, not just as Los Cabos but at other restaurants as well. However, I did call the restraunt directly after my post mates delivered and I discovered my order was incorrect. I was told to file a complaint with postmates for a refund. I simple wanted my cheese enchiladas. The person I spoke with on the phone simply did not care and told me to throw them out or come pick my correct order up from the restraunt. I warned her that this kind of mistake could have been dangerous had I for example been allergic, which I am not. However, I have been a vegetarian for years and therefore I ordered cheese not chicken. I received once again an \"I don't care\" attitude when I expressed this. This leads me to believe that they do not take seriously any food restrictions you may have. So my advice is to really be careful when ordering from here.",

    "text": "Los Cabos is a great restaurant and very reliable for a good bite. I live right around the corner and eat here about two times a month.   You order at the counter when you walk in and get your drinks and then choose a table where they bring you your food. The menu is expansive and they have jarritos, which is always my drink of choice with Mexican food -- the mandarin flavor is the best.   When dining in they promptly bring free chips and salsa which are always tasty...salsa is sometimes spicier than others but that tells me it's fresh and I like spicy anyway.   I've never had a bad meal. I usually get the soft tacos with either carne asada or chicken. Portions are plentiful and three tacos is more than enough to to fill me up. The guac is really good.   All the people who work here are friendly and helpful, if quiet -- which is fine by me!  I'll keep coming back for sure.",

I had hoped for sit down service, but you order at the counter and then grab a seat if you so desire, which is fine. The workers are extra friendly and very helpful. It was a good dinner, I'd come back. I think next time I would just grab takeout for lunch/dinner.  The menu is your standard authentic Mexican dishes. And it comes out extra fast, and warm and delicious. I did an enchilada combo and it was so yummy. I also had a hard taco on the side, but I would pass on that next time. It was shredded beef, but honestly, I prefer a low-end taco bell-esque ground beef concoction.To each their own. We also received complimentary chips and salsa for eating in, so don't bother ordering it.   It was amusing that they don't play Spanish music, but instead just play Discovery Channel shows in Spanish. Counting Cars is great with a Spanish voiceover while chowing down on some refried beans. Dream life at Los Cabos.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: This is only a review for takeout, however if your food tastes amazing after being wrapped up and transported for nearly half an hour, I'd say that speaks volumes about its quality.   I get burritos delivered to my office from Los Cabos via UberEats. They're large (Chipotle sized but not like this has anything else in common with Chipotle!) so one typically feeds me lunch for two days. There's always a side of salsa included, which is a nice touch coming from this Californian. The bottom half is wrapped in foil for a contained eating experience, and the tortilla is large enough to amply hold all the filling without coming unfolded on either end. The tortilla is also thick and stretchy enough to not break when filled.  Standard burritos come with guacamole, pico, and your choice of meat. You can add on a wide variety of toppings, however I usually keep it simple and only add beans or hot sauce. There's also a California style burrito stuffed with fries, sour cream, and cheese in addition to meat. Few places around here serve this San Diego staple, so I appreciate seeing it here. I wish there were a few more shredded meat or spicy options, but for the price and overall quality I'm a fan. I'll definitely stop in and try their other menu items if I'm ever in the area.",

The food in general is bland at best and doesn't compare to any of the Mexican food I've had in Mexico.  I was very insulted when I asked for some sauce and was told that it was American and they didn't do American.  Wow!!!  It's not like they didn't have the sauce, they just seemed anti-American by telling me that.  I was fairly sure that I wasn't going to go back after trying the food the last time, but after that hate session, I won't go back, even if it's a cold day in hell.",

    "text": "We came in because the menu confused me online. The Pittsburgh meets Mexican was very strange to me so I needed to see for myself. For example, fries in certain burritos?! The spot is BYOB and there are a few tables outside if you want to people watch on Penn Ave. It was hot so we opted for an indoor seat. You order at the counter and take your seat.  I got the shrimp burrito (no special sauce as it's sour cream based) and Hubs got the chicken enchilada. We sat down and noticed each table had Heniz ketchup, but not all tables had hot sauce. Yes, Pittsburgh meets Mexican.  We are given chips and salsa and warned the chips were hot. Definitely made fresh, so nice touch. I enjoyed the salsa as it had a good hint of spice. Our food arrives within a reasonable timeframe. The burrito was very much there, no tin foil, making me wonder how to eat it. Bite in and find good garlic flavor with the shrimp. There's nothing more than shrimp and rice. No lettuce or tomato dices. I should have read the menu more clearly as all is as described. Don't assume. There was a lot of shrimp and each bite included a taste of shrimp, so positive. On the chicken enchilada, Hubs thought it was average. The flavors were good, but a generic sense overall.  It's a good neighborhood spot and the service is great. Definitely not an authentic place and the blend with the city's food culture isn't for me. I'll probably be back as the occasion warrants as the service is friendly and food is average.",

Carnitas was decent, the beans were ok, rice was terrible, overcooked & flavorless, soft crumbles.  The churro was pretty good, but the super star here is the queso!  It was the best queso I have ever tasted, made with real cheeses, creamy, and spicy!  I will go back just for the chips & queso!",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to get a late dinner delivered through Uber Eats; Los Cabos had a super low delivery fee and we were both craving Mexican food, so we went for them.   I ordered two beef enchiladas plus chips and salsa. The enchiladas were great! They were packed with beef, the sauce was delicious, and they had a good amount of cheese on top. One cheese tasted really similar to ricotta which kind of threw me off at first but it wasn't -bad- just unexpected. The chips and salsa were good, but the salsa was REALLY SPICY after a few bites, and it took a good 10 minutes to get my mouth to calm down after eating about 15 chips + salsa. As much as I love salsa, the spice level was a little too high for me and I likely won't order their salsa again.  My friend ordered the carnitas burrito. They don't mess around with their burritos - it felt like it weighed 5 pounds when I took it out of the bag. I didn't try it, but my friend said it was fantastic and definitely hit the craving.  Food arrived within the expected delivery window and the driver was super nice (and seemed really surprised by the tip - TIP YOUR UBER EATS DRIVERS FOLKS, they use their own cars to bring your lazy butts food!).  I definitely would like to check this place out in-house sometime, considering how good delivery was, I'm sure it's an even better experience fresh. Plenty of tasty looking stuff on their menu.",

My husband opted for a California burrito, which has fries in the middle (apparently this is a style of burrito popular in San Diego...who knew that putting fries in random foodstuffs was NOT just a Pittsburgh thing?!)

Yelp recommended Los Cabos and we set out on a Friday evening to get dinner before drinks.   You have to order at the counter and they will come serve you where you are seated. The staff were very warm and extremely polite. I was very happy to see they have tamales as an option. We ordered the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was fresh, with a fine blend of tomatoes and shredded cheese on it. It was a big portion and tasted reasonable, but definitely not one of those -will die for it- guac. We ordered the combination meals and I got the enchilada and chille releno. The enchilada was perfect, and the sauce was fresh and flavorful. The chille releno was good too! We also got the tamale and oh man, it was great! Having become a recent fan of tamales, I was so happy to find good tamales in Pittsburgh.  Will definitely come back here to get dinner/take out again.",

    "text": "I'm a Mexican food lover. My boyfriend is not. It's quite upsetting to me because it limits the restaurants we go to. With that being said, I have found a place that he is willing to visit! We've been to Los Cabos about two or three times now and were left impressed after each visit.   It's not a traditional sit down restaurant. You order at the front counter and they will bring you the food. The dining room is decent size, but nothing special. Their is Spanish/Mexican decor and they have Univision playing on the TV. There was only one of other table dining during our last visit. I have a feeling more people get their orders to go. However, if you eat-in, you get chips and salsa for free! Yippie!  The food and value here is unbeatable! I always get the combo meal. For around $10 you get your choice of two items (like a tamale and enchilada), beans and rice. It is a huge dish for a great price! Everything tastes authentic and delicious! I think my favorite dish is their cheese enchilada. My boyfriend likes their chimichangas. We usually end each meal with fried ice cream (because why wouldn't we?). Yummy! I'm getting hungry just typing this. Once again, the portion is huge and well worth the $5.   Service is always very friendly and you can tell they truly appreciate the business. During our last visit, the cook accidentally made me a cheese enchilada instead of the beef one I asked for. Rather than throwing the cheese one out, they let me keep both! It's things like that, that patrons remember and keep us coming back for more.   Only reason I'm not giving them the full five stars, is because their hours are sort of weird. On Yelp, they are listed as staying open till 10PM on weekdays. However, we've tried to go between 9PM-10AM only to find that the doors are locked and lights were off. I don't know if Yelp has incorrect information or they're one of those businesses that shuts down at a different time every night depending on business.",

Some of my favorite dishes are the tilapia fish tacos, the potato taco which comes in a hard shell taco, the fish burrito, chips and salsa (salsa is a bit spicy), and their rice and beans are the best I've had.  Great for dining in or taking out. They also have outside seating which I go to a lot with my dogs in the summer.  If you haven't eaten at Los Cabos you're definitely missing out.",

I went to lunch 8 hours ago!  Food is served very prompt and is absolutely delicious!  Taco bell, Mad Mex and other \"authentic mexican\" establishments are like puke compared to this place.  You order at the counter and then your're seated.  Before your meal, you are served tortilla chips and the best organic salsa this side of the border!  The interior is bright, yet not too overwhelming.  A nice blend of deep reds and black.  I always love to find new places to call my own.  Please include this place as a precursor to your daily siesta!",

It is almost like a melting pot of freshness, cheaposity, and choice.  Liberawesome!   I have had the shredded chicken burrito, the bean tostada, the quesadilla, and the California Burrito. So far California Burrito is my absolute favorite. Carne asada, fries, and a sour cream sauce make a super-filling and super-tasty dinner.  Since sizes are so huge, i usually cut it in half and have my lunch for the next day.  I am looking forward to trying the Pittsburgh Burrito which has fries and coleslaw!   Service is fast and friendly and in the case of the hostess, SUPER CUTE.  They never rush you to place your order and are willing to make substitutions. I always leave a nice tip because i enjoy eating there.    I plan to come here even more often once i wean the husband off of Qdoba and Chipotle!  I LUVZ U, LOS CABOS!",

The prices were very reasonable, the service was great, and the food was incredible. Recently, I go there with some caution. I've had a few instances where the owners/managers and regular cooks were not there, and the service and food was noticeably worse. I believe that I once waited about 20 minutes for a burrito, which I found to be really strange. However, other times that I go the food comes out extremely fast and tastes amazing. The menu is extensive, which is great. They recently raised their prices though, so you can end up paying up to about $9 for a burrito FYI. I would recommend this place, but go there knowing that there's a small chance you will be disappointed (although I hope not!).",

    "text": "I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good \"Mex\" restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review.  First, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the \"California Surfing\" burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce.  The only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there -- including these two menu items on other occasions -- has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon.  It's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though.  I have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times. At least, it will for now.",

    "text": "I've found, to my disappointment, that Pittsburgh and Mexican food generally don't mix. Let me give you a heads up and say that I did recently move from TX, so make of my comment what you will. However, having moved from TX, I feel like my opinion should count for something, right? ; )   I always order a chicken quesadilla from all the new Mexican restaurants I try. It's my go to dish for determining whether I'll be back. While other Mexican(y) restaurants here have failed to deliver on the quesadilla front, Los Cabos has not. Their chicken quesadilla was nicely flavored and had a crispy tortilla shell....just the way they served it in TX! Granted, it's probably not the best tasting quesadilla I've ever had, but it's definitely the best I've tried in Pittsburgh! I also appreciate that they throw in a free basket of chips and salsa with your order (what's with the whole charging for a basket of chips? I've never seen that until I moved here!). I've tried their queso and while it wasn't bad tasting, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was more of a salsa/cheese mix than a creamy, thick, cheese sauce. I think I'll pass on the queso next time I'm there and try their guac instead.   If you go, just keep in mind this place is more of a order at the front, seat yourself, grab your own drink kind of place (think Panera) instead of an actual sit down restaurant with a bar. So while I'm still in search of a great tasting Margarita here in the 'Burgh, I at least know exactly where to go to get my fill of Mexican food.",

The meal came out hot; however, I noticed that the tortillas used for the enchiladas were somewhat stale at the edges.  Serving sizes were generous and overall service at the restaurant is fantastic.  Chips come complementary with your meal.  While the actual tortilla chips are solid, the salsa is a standard watery roja-type concoction used in many other Mexican restaurants.  Overall my initial impression is that Los Cabos is a quick, cheap and solid establishment, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I will be sure to give this place another shot in the near future.",

I don't know, but anyhow I came for my first time today with my special lady. I don't know why but I was slightly agro that I couldn't find parking, I have to say it was sort of tight.   We came in right before the lunch rush and were greated by a nice lady and she was kind enough to answer my barrage of questions. The menu is extensive and I really didn't know what to get so we both went with combos which I think are a pretty good deal for what you get quantity wise.   To sum up everything we tried: tostadas and chicken enchilada combo, I thought that the tostada was pretty good but the enchilada was definitely lacking. Why was the enchilada lacking? red sauce was pretty weak, almost as if it was straight out of the can. The rice was ehhh and beans were slightly bland. You might ask what do I want out of my rice and beans? Ahhh For them not to be ehhh, the rice to not be super dry and the beans to be flavorful. Also the chips and salsa???? What's up with that, they were cold,really cold. If you are going to have fresh chips, serve them fresh... not sitting in the ambient air of the cold entry area soaking up staleness. we also tried the beef taco which was good,extremely juicey. and Chile Relleno which was also tasty.    I will come back and give it another whirl maybe I'm not ordering the right stuff or coming at the right time. I wish this place would have blown me away. Any suggestions????",

I opened the container and there was this kind of oily pile of tortilla mush with some sauce and lot's of seasonings. I was so hungry so I started eating but it was not the good spice I look for. It just seemed that they added too much heat to the dish, it was all I could taste. As for the egg?? I didn't see any. I ate enough to lose my hunger pangs but would not order that item again.   My lunch partners ordered tacos, a fish salad, and a taco salad that all looked better than my choice. I know the office will order from there again so next time I will try the fish salad.",

Sometimes you'll pay for a side of fries and get about 10, other times a nice-sized container. Same with the side of sour cream. It'll be $0.50 for a teaspoon half the time. Food quality is similarly inconsistent I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if they learned to be consistent.",

I happened upon Los Cabos by accident. The first time I went I ordered the shredded chicken burrito -- SO SO SO GOOD. I've also got an exceptional bean tostada. there. (I've also had an underwhelming chicken taco, but, five stars nonetheless for service and for the excitement of finally finding good mexican).   Also, reasonable prices!",

    "text": "How hard is it to make Mexican Food filled with flavor?  Such simple ingredients shouldn't be so difficult - rice, beans, tortilla shells...but you'd be surprised how bland these ingredients can be in the wrong hands. I tried the Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend had the fish tacos.  Even though there were supposed to be other ingredients the only thing I tasted was the heavy portion of carne asada and fries...maybe  a little cheese.  No Guac, no salsa to be seen.  I did like the crunch and flavor of the corn chips but the salsa needed about 1/2 bottle of Tapatio to give it some flavor and spice.  The best part of the burrito was the grilled tortilla shell which gave the burrito some crunch. My friend's fish tacos were also lacking in the flavor department - he decided to also dose it in Tapatio and then cut up the taco and mix it with the side of rice and beans. So no matter how late or drunk you are - pass by go and do not stop at Los Cabos.",

    "text": "Los Cabos is amazing. A-MAZING. Everything I've had there is good, and I try to order a different menu item every time I go (the menu is huge). The bean and cheese burritos are the best standby and insanely cheap at $2.99. The food is wonderful, but the people who work here knock it up to 5 stars. My friends and I have a tendency to forget what time it is and stay past closing, and they are always so great about it. We once shot a champagne cork into the kitchen by accident and they could not have been more gracious (it probably didn't hurt that we gave them some of the champagne). Even if you don't like the food, take a group and a six pack to Los Cabos and I guarantee you'll have a good time.   Oh, and please tip well! You tip at the counter when you order, so don't forget to drop these ladies and gents a little love on your way out, they definitely earn it.",

    "text": "I stopped in today because I was tired of the hospital food across the way and had been eyeing up their food on here.  It's a very intimate place without any hint of intimacy.   Saying it is tiny and lacks atmosphere is a more accurate representation.   I got my food to go so maybe the real flair is in the presentation of the meals.  I ordered the fish tacos, the carne asada fries and an order of churros for a total of 23.00 and change.  The carne asada fries looked great with the exception of the guacamole.   I'm not a huge fan of guacamole but at times I'll try it when it looks fresh and chunky.  This stuff was thin and watery which made it very tough to remove from the meal.  The remainder was good but nothing spectacular.  The fish tacos got mixed reviews but I found them to be better than expected.  I would certainly have them again.  The refried beans and rice that came with them were also very good.  The highlight of the meal was the churros.   It's just a shame that an order is only 3 pieces because I would of bought a second order if I had known.  Don't judge me for that.  I'm sure this place has a few highlight dishes and if it was closer to my home I'd be tempted to try a few more items and see what gems they have to offer.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am from California. I grew up in NorCal and spent my college and post college years in SoCal...and I miss Mexican food.  First of all, I read a review stating \"Socal, Tex it's all the same to me for the most part.\" They are very different styles of food and I think its important to go into Los Cabos knowing that  Now to the meat of the matter (yes that word choice was on purpose). This is not your Northern California Mexican food; no nicely grilled chicken with rice and black beans in a whole wheat tortilla. This is a burrito that consists of only large amounts of meat, cheese and guacamole wrapped in an amazingly tasty (and likely fatty) flour tortilla. While not quite the same as what I ate regularly in Cali, it is still very good. I would probably give it a 4/5 stars if it were in San Diego, but I'd still eat there regularly especially because their California burrito is actually better than the ones I used to eat.   If you've never had a California burrito, you should. It has the usual meat, cheese and guac, but also has fries. The reason why Los Cabos' California burrito is so amazing is that they make sure their fries are crispy which add more texture and flavor to this awesome burrito. I have yet to try their carne asada fries, but I can only imagine they will be amazing.   You must try Los Cabos. They are by far the best Pittsburgh has to offer for Mexican food that I have found so far.",
