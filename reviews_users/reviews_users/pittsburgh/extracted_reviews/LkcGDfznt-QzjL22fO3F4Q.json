Awesome bar and grill and they have a great rotating draft list with a lot of local brews which is nice. Everything I've eaten here has been good...sandwiches, pizzas, soups. Always have a seat at or near the bar. And, the service is always wonderful! For the type of place it is and the expectations one might have for a casual bar and grill, Stoke's is 5 stars.",

    "text": "I'd looked online and Yelp for good ideas for places to eat in the North Hills besides chain restaurants, and Stoke's seemed like a good choice.  We came in around 4 and there were a handful of people both at the bar and in the main dining area.  An attentive, and helpful waitress seated us immediately.  I was starving and we were both excited to try from the craft beer selection.  We were offered samples of a lager before we bought it, which was a nice touch!  We ordered the white fries (aiolli and garlic onion strings topped) which really hit the spot.  The fries were crisp and hot.  He ordered a burger and onion rings, but fries were brought instead.  They were apologetic, and brought the rings quickly and we kept the fries.  I had the larkshead roast beef pretzel.  The beef was just a tiny bit dry, but the tasted very good.  I didn't mind that it wasn't a pretzel bun, but instead a real pretzel.  I actually like a little \"pick apart\" food.  The salad was mixed greens, fresh and not wilted.  The waitress came back multiple times to check on us.  The prices are typical of the American pub places.  The food is a cross between some convenience with a flair of creative ideas and better quality food items.  Kinda enjoyed the Beatles, 60s and 70s music vibe that day.  Overall, we would return if in the area to try more brews and some of the soups.  No complaints here.",

The kicker was the waitress who didnt bring us water for almost the entirety of the meal. It was dead on a saturday night, she had 2 other tables and couldnt remember WATER. She came back three times after we had to ask twice for the water and we are sitting there cringing as we ate our sodium packed meal without water. Im not saying it was overly salty or anything, but for what we were eating we didnt want our water right before the fucking check; the russian dressing, au ju dip, the pesto on the french fries. I had to force it all down because i had no water, put it in a cup and bring it to me, dont come back with more of my salty food and NOT the fucking water i should have had before my app got here. She would disappear for 15 mins at a time and then come back without water. To top it all off she stole $5 out of our change. She didnt bring back the check with our change and after we waited like suckers for 10 minutes for her to come back we got the hint she was hiding from us in the kitchen we gave up and left.",

The BLT was \"classic\" style, quality toasted white bread and lots of crispy bacon. So much in fact I managed to knock over my water glass while trying to stuff it all back in the sandwich. The fried pretzel was very meh, I wouldn't get it again.  The soup and mac and cheese was excellent and reheated well for dinner at home. Lots of homemade mac and cheese is oily/greasy but the consistency of the Stoke's version was perfect, super creamy and the cheese hugged the noodles. Soup had a great flavor, very peppery.   Pricing was a buck or two more you might pay at your average  diner but you can tell they use quality/homemade components which is why it is a little bit more. Overall I enjoyed my lunch here. The order at the counter style is nice if you are alone or want to get something quick for takeout.",

Their soups, in particular, their butternut squash soup, is also very good.  The spices in the squash soup - the warm nutmeg - and the creaminess of it, make it so good.  Perfect in the wintertime!  When we dined in, we got the white fries with the white garlic aioli - very very good.  I really liked the aioli.  While neither my husband or I drink beer, they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers.  I'm particularly impressed with the place despite it being in a strip mall.",

Two were needed because they were stuffed full!  There were a very nice portion of crispy fried shrimp. Along with the shrimp was a crispy tasty slaw. I don't know what all was in the sale but it complimented the shrimp perfectly. There was lime juice and a salsa too. The tacos came with hand made chips which were light and crispy. I also ordered a cup of their Mac & Cheese. It was made with a white cheese that is melted and poured over small pasta shells. It is creamy and smooth and a bit rich. I can't imagine eating a bowl of it as a meal, but it is offered as such.  I will definitely go back and try more items on their menu.",

This sandwich was pitiful and pathetic! There was 2 pieces of ham and the pork didn't even cover all the small bread. Told bartender and she took it in the back and came right back out and said sorry they weigh it and that's how it is, 4 ounces she said. Trust me the whole sandwich didn't weigh 4 ounces. I recognized the male owner and he didn't have decency to come and say two words to me about it. I understand weighing things but if you can't make a sandwich look good for $10 maybe you should up the weight. Onion rings were a joke too, 5 of the smallest, thinnest onions you could get for $1 more. Too many other places with better value. WE WILL NOT BE BACK STOKES!",

They used store chili that tasted like it came from the can. No flavor, originality or quality to it. The pretzels were more like one pretzel and came HAND RIPPED apart. Yes, they ripped it with their hands. Gross  The meal:  - I got a burger on a pretzel bun with chips. The pretzel bun wasn't a bun, it was a pretzel cut in half. What? Immediately went over to a waitress and asked for a bun. I waited and waited, nothing came. Our waitress then came over and apologized and she didn't even bring a bun. I also asked for chips and she gave me fries. We ended up telling them to take the burger back because we didn't want to pay for it and it took so long that I wasn't even hungry.  - My mom got a hoagie. If the burger thing sounded bad, this was right up there. The hoagie came on two three inch dinner rolls. There was barely any lettuce and one tomato. It was basically a sandwich, not a hoagie. The presentation and ingredients were awful. My mom was going to give it back but she was hungry and we had wasted enough time on the whole fiasco.  - The waitress apologized for the bad experience. Did she get a manager? No. Did they give us a discount to entice us to try again? No. They did nothing. They didn't care.  Overall:  - This place was awful and may have been one of the worst meals we've ever had. I have no idea why anyone would go to this place when the North Park Longue is right up the street and gives you more food with better quality for the same price. This place is awful and we will never go back.",

To their menu, they've also added pizza, which from the few I have tried were amazing.

Excellent and varied beer selection, extremely knowledgeable bar and wait staff, great and inventive food. We usually just eat and leave, though. With the super boring music, there is no incentive to head to the bar area afterwards to enjoy a few more drinks. We're usually half asleep by the time we're done eating. We're not looking for a club scene, but a little bit more upbeat music would punch the vibe up just enough to make people linger a bit longer. After all, that's what they want, right?",

    "text": "Thanks to a gross, rainy night I was craving some soup. After living in the North Hills for about 8 months I've driven past stokes probably 100 times. Being in the mood for soup I knew that it was finally time to stop driving by and finally venture in. Stokes Grill is located in a strip mall on Mcknight Road and the interior of the space reflects this. It's large, wide open, and lacking in personality. One thing I did appreciate though was that the interior walls are decorated with art from local artists, all of which is for sale.   For what the space lacks in personality it makes up for in great food. I ordered the Buf Chix wrap, a buffalo chicken wrap full of your standard fixins and blue cheese dressing. To accompany my wrap, and  to fulfill my soup craving, I order a bowl of their broccoli cheddar soup. The soup was delivered quickly, piping hot, and in a large portion. I'd say Stoke's broccoli cheddar soup rivals all others out there and certainly defeats Pannera's, my long time favorite.   The reason I give Stoke's 4 stars rather than 5 is the price. A wrap, a bowl of soup, and a fountain drink ran me $15. Yes, the bowl of soup was large and the wrap came with chips, but I feel like this was priced about $3-5 too high. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other soups and sandwiches, but its probably only going to be on days where I'm flushed with cash!  Also its BYOB",

The decor and heating in the restaurant leave something to be desired... We were pretty cold inside, and the booths/tables were a little aged. The drinks/beer menu were also surprisingly diverse and tasty. We got a ginger beer concoction and a craft brew that were both tasty.  I'm glad to have discovered this place.",

I really want this restaurant to thrive - they're local owned - but they are never crowded - and I would bet that it's due to the lack of staff.  We were there at 7 pm on a Saturday night and less than half the tables had people.  Also, on this particular visit, they were out of many beers.  My husband asked for 3 different beers and they were all out - and the people at the table next to us had the same issues.

    "text": "A solid lunch here today with the best service I've ever experienced here. I warned my family that our actual lunch would be good but service would be pretty sketchy from my previous experiences here. That was, thankfully, not the case today. And this is actually the first time I've been here- and I've visited maybe 6-8 times over the past few years-that I have not had absolutely dismal service. We were sat quickly when we arrived around 12:30. I should note there were only two other tables at this time. Our server was quite young, first time I've seen her here, but she was very nice and checked back on us frequently. The beer selection, while not as top notch as I have become accustomed to since moving to DC, is quite extensive for the Burgh with many craft options. I had a beer- bells two hearted which at $6 is quite reasonably priced. Yuengling was on special- and is all day Saturday- for $2. Soup options were plentiful- chili, crab bisque, tomato pepper jack, cream of mushroom, wedding, and split pea. Sandwich special was a turkey, Apple, cheddar, and bacon, which sounded pleasant but I went with my tried and True favorite- turkey Reuben on French. I did the 1/2 sandwich with soup and chose wedding. The wedding was pipping hot (perfect for the dreary Pittsburgh day) and very flavorful. It was chock full of both chicken and meat balls with celery and carrots. The traditional spinach and pearl pasta was missing, nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed my soup. I wish there had been a tad more 1000 island on the sandwich but I won't make bones about it. My mom had the pulled pork and said it was quite tasty with a smoky yet sweet BBQ sauce. My dad had the frizzle quesadilla, consisting of chicken, bacon, cheddar,and ranch. It was a very large portion and came with a side (he chose broccoli salad) too. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan hoagie with fries. He enjoyed the hoagie, which was again, quite large in portion size. The fries, which I can vouch for since I snagged a few, were hot and crispy with a nice seasoned salt/pepper mix on top. I highly recommend visiting Stokes if you're in the area. It's always nice to support a local business, particularly in the sea of chain restaurants that is McKnight Road.",

Positives : Great beer selection  Creative menu  Negatives: Small portions Negative attitude of the staff  Small bar area   During the hour and a half I was there, one of the waitresses had 3 separate meltdowns... All related to the fact that she rang in a drink wrong and mistake caused drafts instead of flights to be poured.   Further, I was deciding between 2 different drafts and chose a beer due to the menu saying that it was on special. When I got my check, it was showing full price. I showed it to the bartender (who, in her defense, was the nicest person we saw last night) and she got her manager. The manager acted like I was the one who made the mistake and acted annoyed that I brought it up to her. She, instead of giving me the sale price on the 3 beers I drank since her beer list stated it incorrectly, gave me an discount of $3.50.  I still was overcharged but didn't have the energy to fight it.   It's a shame that they don't want to bring in more customers because it has potential..",

I order the veggie sandwich (which comes with an assortment of veggies) with provolone & Russian dressing on a pretzel. It is so delicious! Also their fresh house made potato chips are so good!!

Most of the beers we had were delicious.  My only complaint is service related. Every time you come in there is no one to greet you. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to sit down. It would be better if they put the menus on the table & had people seat themselves. We had friend's birthday parties here & they were great.",

Stoke's Grill serves your standard pub grub, dressed up cheese fries and there was buffalo chicken dip.  The service was attentive and well organized. I was dining with about 8 other people and the food came out hot, orderly and well prepared. There were murmurs of satisfaction around the table and the ladies I was with all seemed to be digging their meals.  Even though the meal was forgettable it wasn't disappointing.

There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it was very quiet and kind of had an overall awkward atmosphere - some TV ambient noise or a louder radio may be good here - we could hear everyone chewing and conversations around us - not pleasant.   I'm not sure if Stoke's has undergone new ownership or just gone downhill but for a non-busy afternoon on a Saturday our food was horrible and service was really slow (there were only 4 tables full in the whole place!). Freezer bag french fries that tasted like it...they were cold and soggy while some of them tasted like they maybe had been sitting around somewhere since the start of the day... None of our food was hot (or even tasted that good for that matter). I had the \"Dank\" pressed meatball/pesto sandwich - meatballs were again clearly from a bag and frozen and hubs had the \"monte cristo\"  - again awful - cold, soggy and just tasted like white bread. Super disappointing.   We also got a small order of wings - sauce was greasy at best, wings were burnt, dry and over fried, and the \"pretzel bites\" with \"queso\" - the cheese sauce here was probably most disturbing...it was gritty and grainy and tasted like a bad taco. Gross.   We sadly won't be back.",

That being said, the food is always very good.  I love the tomato pepper jack soup!  The burgers are good as is the chicken parm sandwich.  They have an excellent selection of beer on tap and a fairly large menu.  I really, really want them to do a better job with their waitstaff so I can bump this to five stars.  Until they get better, three is all I can do.  Update: it seems as though the waitstaff has gotten better or they hired more.  Wait times have dropped so I bumped up another star.

    "text": "Overall I would say Stoke's is a very average establishment.  The place could definitely be better with some very easy and minor changes.  The best part of my last experience was our server, Austin.  She was very friendly, helpful, and hard working.  To start, the atmosphere of the place is very boring and plain.  The inside had no personality and just seems like a firehall with some tables and a bar thrown into it.  The TVs are too small to see.  The music is so low that you can hear a pin drop.  The presentation of all of the food is also very poor.  Cheap plastic containers and things just thrown onto a plate.  I get that it is a sports bar, but the best sports bars put in the extra effort on small things which make a big difference.  The food is pretty decent.  I had the French dip sandwich last time and it had a good flavor.  The buffalo chicken dip is also pretty good here, but for some reason they give you potatoes chips instead of tortilla chips.  Makes no sense.  I have also had their wings, salads, and pretzel sandwiches.  All of those were simply average.",

Usually when I find a place I love, I order the same thing most of the time. But at Stoke's I keep trying different items and I'm never disappointed. It also has a great draft list and separate eating space for families and folks at the bar. Excellent prompt service, and a place that everytime I go back to, I think we should come here more.  While not a pizza place per se, after 5 years of independent testing my husband and I think it's the best pizza in Pittsburgh.",

Considering Stoke's is a bar serving many different types of craft beers with a large food menu, we figured it would be bumping. It was anything but. It was seriously so quiet and so awkward. The bar and restaurant were full! It was the establishment itself. We actually asked each other if we wanted to just get up and leave. We sat in the bar area and there was no music or TVs with sound on. So if you were looking for a lively Friday night spot, stay far away!  As far as food is concerned, it was decent. We started with buffalo chicken dip. The dip itself was amazing! However, it is served with house made potato chips. With buffalo chicken dip I prefer tortilla type chips, the housemade chips were good but not mixed with the dip. An option for either would be cool! My husband enjoyed his beef dip and Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was SO GOOD!! I had a \"Stoke's favorite\" pretzel sandwich. It was ok. The pretzel was fried and I am not a fan of fried greasiness. The pretzel was also very thin so I mostly just ate turkey. I will say the menu is very large and they serve half portions of some menu items which I think is an awesome idea for restaurants.   I'd give 2 stars but bonus star for our server! Austin was awesome and so nice! She gave suggestions and was super personable.",

I ordered a fish sandwich with fries and i am used to ordering fish and it being this huge sandwich. This was more on the smaller end. I don't think that is a bad or good thing, just pointing it out in case you are used to those fish sandwiches that are falling out of the bun on the ends. The sandwich was good, I wouldn't say it was anything to rave about. The waitstaff/bartenders were friendly and the drinks reasonably priced. I would come back if i was meeting someone again, but its not going to be added to my frequent flyers list of places to eat.",

This is complete incompetence on the owner and managers part hiring people like this. The menu is a very hard read at best. Way to much packed onto the dark hard to disifer menu.

    "text": "I am simply amazed as to how many restaurants there are along McKnight Road.  I wasn't familiar with this place so we decided to see what it was all about.  It's located in one of the older plazas along McKnight and it is almost hard to spot unless you are really looking for it. It is located in the same plaza as Lasik Vision.  The place is very spacious, almost too spacious because the layout seems to be off balance or something.  Large wide open dining room on one side and a separate bar with some tables throughout in the other room.  Our waitress was in training so we had two servers.  They were a cute team.  Between the two of them we were thanked at least 25 times during our meal.  Speaking of the meal, I did something I normally don't do -  I ordered a sandwich that I absolutely had no real desire to try but I just had to order it to see how it would turn out.  I ordered the Monte Cristo.  The menu describes it as such: Ham, turkey and provolone.  Battered and deep fried crispy and served with a side of roasted red pepper aioli.  It looked liked fried chicken when it was served but I must say it tasted better than I thought it would but it was way too heavy to finish it  myself.  It would be something fun to order and share with a few people.  The aioli gave it a nice zing.  The menu overall offers grilled sandwiches, pressed sandwiches, wraps, hoagies, burgers, pretzel sandwiches, salads, 3 kinds of mac n cheese, homemade chips, homemade soups made from scratch, regular and specialty pizzas.   My friend ordered the Stokes pick two which is a side salad or cup of soup with a half sandwich for $ 8.00.  I look forward to another visit to Stoke's Grill.",

The Monte Cristo Sandwich (ham, turkey, and provolone sandwich) was quartered, battered, and fried. The roasted red pepper aioli (red pepper mayo) made for a nice dipping sauce. The broccoli salad was a very nice surprise. The broccoli was fresh and raw, the red onion was not overtly oniony, and the dressing was slightly sweet and just enough so you could still taste the other ingredients.  On another Yelper's tip, I tried the Ropa Vieja. It's a pressed sandwich featuring slightly spicy shredded pork (carnitas pork) and roasted red peppers with a side of au jus. I selected the onion rings for my side, which were definitely a hit with the batter staying on the onion and not sliding off.",

The food is ultra high quality, and also on the more creative side. The prices are excellent and the staff are genuinely warm and friendly. This place can get ridiculously busy, especially at lunch, so you may have to wait a while for your order, or even to get seated sometimes, but there is a VERY good reason why so many people choose to eat here. Aside from the food, the selection of beers is exceptionally diverse. Most of the beer is craft beer, or smaller breweries. This is not the kind of place where Budweiser would ever feel welcome, or Coors. Anyway, this place is exceptional. Don't forget to also try their pizza. While Stoke's is not a pizzeria, they easily could be one, because the pizza is among the best I have ever had. Again, some very exotic options for pizza. If you do not at least try this place once, you are a fool. I cannot be more clear.",

Their green fries sounded appetizing, (fries, pesto sauce and brie) so we decided to share them around the table.  The counter lady asked if I wanted the fries out first and I said yes. Apparently that means \"Please bring them out jut two seconds before the rest of the food for the table.\"  The first order had a hair in them.  They were gracious and replaced them, bringing them to use when we were about 75% through our meal.  At that point we really didn't want them, but there didn't offer to refund me and I didn't really ask.  they were bland, the pesto was only on the top 10 fries and the brie was invisible I guess. My chicken fingers were pretty run of the mill, the honey mustard was good however.  My friend ordered a pretzel sandwich and said it was really good and another girl ordered the lobster bisque.

    "text": "Stoke's is fairly stupdendous, given its slightly humble location (on McKnight Road, but in a little retail strip that's boring at best). Their menu is extensive - soups, sandwiches on any carbohydrate-based lifeform imaginable, salads, burgers, and sides. That could sound potentially dull, but Stoke's hallmark is taking standard deli-grill offerings and either adding a gourmet ingredient or two (pesto, artichokes, and Brie on the fries!) or replacing crap-from-a-can with their own homemade or homecooked ingredients (roasted beef, fresh cheese sauce). The food, at worst, is satisfying and tasty, and at best is \"omigod why don't I eat here every day.\" Usually the latter. The soups are ungodly good - atypical offerings like a chilled banana rum are great in summertime, and their cream of mushroom actually tastes of real mushrooms, instead of a gloppy milky mixture. As far as service goes, you couldn't ask for a friendlier fare. The owners (a young couple) offer genuine smiles every time, and are quick to accommodate their customers. It's clean, it's bright, there's plenty of beverage options (BYOB, as well). Prices are very reasonable (around $7 for most sandwich-type things) especially considering the portions are swell, and they often come with homemade chips!",

    "text": "I have gone to Stoke's Grill over the years and always had a decent experience. After tonight I will not be going back. When I first walked in, I stood at the hostess stand for at least 5 minutes, and did not once see an employee enter the dining room, and there were other tables there. When I finally was greeted it was an awkward \"so like,?did you order take out, or.....?\" To which I said I'd like a table(duh). I was sat at a dirty table, and than sat for another 5 minutes at least, while I was not acknowledged by anyone. Just as I was about to get up, a server came over, and another awkward greeting and drink order. After waiting another few minutes I moved into the bar. The service was slightly better in there, but still terrible. Waited with closed menus for a good 20 minutes or so. Once our order was in, the food came in a reasonable amount of time, and was mediocre. I will say they have a decent Reuben, but if you order the fries, they suck. Sorry, can't sugar coat that. For a place that makes their own food, getting a side of crappy frozen french fries is disappointing. Once our food came we waited again to get condiments, and again for our check. As a SIN veteran, and a former local, small business owner, I am surprised that they have made it this far with such a lackluster experience, considering the recent boom in awesome local eateries, where the service typically matches the incredible food. It's one thing when a restaurant/bar is busy; I have no problem waiting however long it takes, as long as I see that the service is making a valiant effort, but this experience was clearly just lazy people giving zero f***s.",

The Pittsburgh Dip is like a French dip sandwich but with fried onion twists, French fries and cheese melted on and comes with an au jus. The Yellow fries have cheddar and bacon served with a side of ranch. The Rangamala is a half pound burger with cheddar cheese and bacon (and super juicy!).  The White fries have garlic aioli and parmesan sauce on them. The sandwiches were served with homemade potato chips and a pickle. All were very good!  Portions are just right.  They aren't skimpy nor overwhelming. I noticed some comments about the cost.  My bill did come to $33 but the food is fresh.  The hamburger is hormone and antibiotic free. I don't mind paying a little extra for quality food. They are expanding the restaurant and is currently under renovation, but they are open and it is super clean.  The other side they are putting in a bar.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Service was prompt. Yes, they are now full service! There isn't a thing I could find negative about the place.  We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu!",

    "text": "I went to Stoke's Grill while visiting the Target on Mcknight Road for a quick dinner. I imagined it to be a full sit-down restaurant for some reason so I was a little surprised when it turned out to be more of a smaller casual type of place. You order your food at the counter and they bring it out to you.  I got the Italian Beef sandwich which was Italian seasoned beef with hot peppers and provolone on a hoagie roll. To go with it I ordered some onion rings as well. My girlfriend got the tomato pepper jack soup, a meatball sandwich and a side of their homemade potato chips. The Italian beef wasn't like what you'd get in Chicago and would probably be pure blasphemy over there but I liked it. It was a simple sandwich but the ingredients went well together. My only gripe was I wished the beef was cut thinner and had some juice with it. It wasn't dry but when I think of Italian beef I think of heavily seasoned, thin meat that is swimming in its own au jus.  The onion rings were really good. The batter they used was the cripsy kind rather than that soggy grainy kind you sometimes see. They epitomized the texture and flavor of a good onion ring. They were browned with a good crunch to them and the onion in the middle was cooked thoroughly and didn't slide out like a worm (this almost makes me gag when it happens with badly prepared rings, it's such a terrible mental image).  Janey thought the meatball sandwich was just average. She likes her meatballs seasoned and she said they didn't have a lot of flavor, just ground beef. She liked it but she wasn't blown away by it. The chips were really good, though. Whoever fries in the kitchen knows what they're doing.  The soup was creamy and spicy and really good. It was more peppery than tomato which is why I liked it. I'm not a tomato person so tomato soup has never been one of my favorites. Janey really enjoyed the soup and even though she's not much of a sandwich eater thought we should come back again and try more of the menu.  The interior of Stoke's is very nice and is clean. The guy at the counter was really nice and friendly as well.",

    "text": "I've been anxious to try Stoke's for a while now, and when a Living Social deal popped up, I jumped on it.    My husband and I were both home one week day and needed some quick lunch to-go.  Despite looking from the outside like a sit down bar and grill type joint, I had heard that Stokes was more of a grab and go sort of place.    I was impressed by the menu, so many things sounded good.  I decided on a half a sandwich and soup combo, the grilled cheese and the pepperjack tomato soup.  My husband got the BLT and the chili.    My grilled cheese was on soft, delicious bread.  The cheeses were melted until oozy - just the way I like it.  The pepperjack was a nice variation on traditional tomato soup, giving it a spicy kick and bold flavor.    My husband's BLT had a lot of crispy bacon, which he enjoyed, although he said the chili was \"just OK\" (I'll pretend that's because chili I make is out of this world).  Stoke's made us a very satisfying lunch, definitely a step up from other quick places in the area.  Two reasons why I did not give it 5 stars, though...  1.  The marketing of Stoke's is just all wrong.  The exterior really makes you think it's something that it is not.  Also, their menu, although impressive, is designed so that it is very hard to read.  I'd like to think this place would be way more popular if they fixed these few small details!  2.  The pricing is a little steep for what you get.  Our lunches were over $20 total, which I thought was more than what I would pay elsewhere.  Still, I'd compare it to a local Panera Bread, with better ingredients, flavors, and choices.",

    "text": "I posted on Facebook suggestions for lunch in the North Hills and someone recommended this place to me.  It looked like it had easy enough access for me, so I decided to check it out.  I was craving a healthy-but-salty (oxymoron, right?) salad but changed my mind when I checked out the menu.  It's an average sized place with a counter that you walk up to and order from.  You pay, sit, and they bring your food to you.  It is BYO which is nice but not traditional as the place doesn't really seem to \"fit\" a BYO restaurant in the vibe or menu (it's a deli essentially).  I ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese because it had an entire section on the menu for it so I figured it would be good.  I also ordered the Motmot wrap which had turkey, bacon, some tomato aioli.   I also got a foundtain drink.  It ended up at about $15 which seemed a little high for a lunch.  The service was quick which is nice for a workday lunch.    The (side order) of mac and cheese?  It was really good and could be a meal in itself.  The bowl was put under a broiler to make it a little crispy.  The noodles were slightly overcooked which I do not prefer in  mac and cheese but the star of the dish was, of course, the cheese.  Thick cheese sauce that I knew was hearty after three bites.  Very cheddary--not too sharp.  It was more like a glue than a sauce.  The wrap came with chips and was served warm which I was not expecting.  Too much aioli--this is common at restaurants anywhere, but I don't think a sandwhich needs to be dripping in dressing, especially since this was nothing special.  The turkey was nice and thinly sliced.  The bacon felt more like bacon bits than chopped bacon or even slices of bacon.  The turkey was fresh.  I only had a few chips.  I couldn't tell if they were house made or otherwise.    I went back after my three bites of mac and cheese for more.  Outside of the noodles being overcooked, that dish is really something special.    I would go back to try something else, just not a wrap because I think for the cost it's lacking in execution and flavor.",

I thought it was odd that it didn't come with cheese since there wasn't much to the sandwich.  I asked for provolone cheese.  When we got the bill, I found we were charged $1.50 for one slice of cheese which is ridiculous.  After we ordered, I wanted to change my side dish choice so I asked the waitress if it was too late to make the change.  She said it was because the kitchen gets really mad when you make a change.  There was no sense complaining about it because the owner acts if he is doing you a favor by being at his restaurant.  He definitely needs to improve his customer service skills.",
