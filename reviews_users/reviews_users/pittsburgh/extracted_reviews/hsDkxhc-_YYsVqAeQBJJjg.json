    "text": "I've been here a couple times and like it --- it's comfortable in a yinzer way. The walls have dark paneling, the food is unpretentious, the portions are huge, the bill is low - and the service is pleasant but not overly chatty/fake.    My favorites on the menu are chicken parm and pizza. The chicken parm is huge (2-3 meals on a plate, basically). The chicken isn't pounded too thin, which is key because they do put a decent amount of \"crust\" on the chicken (which I happen to like because mmm FRIED BATTER) and the pasta isn't overcooked. Pizza isn't thin crust -- but it's not pan thick either. I love it for that reason. It holds up to the tons of cheese (that actually melts into goo without being a gummy mess). The pasta and pizza sauces are good -- on the sweeter side, but not overly so. Husband likes the turkey club - it has a ton of thick sliced turkey breast.   I'm mainly taking a star off because I don't like their fries, which are homemade shoe string. I am kind of picky when it comes to fries -- so, maybe I am being too critical. I just found them to be kind of mushy and weak. Maybe I just got a bad batch? I dunno, after having them once, I never ordered them again.   The neighborhood is just fine. Unless working class neighborhoods and urban infrastructure scares you. I think it reads as sketchy  to some people because it's tiny, nothing is fancy, and the businesses aren't all clustered together. The Run looks like a small working class town.",

One thing food places similar to Big Jim's does to offset the mediocre food is the portion, in the run the food tastes better and the portions set the bar again.   The calzone is a large supreme pizza folded in half. It typically takes me 3 meals to complete it. The Reuben is solid, big thick and flavorful as the toppings overflow the sides of the marble rye bread. The burgers, I feel are a little lacking, but they offer a black bean burger. The eggplant parm appetizer is easily a filling meal for one person.",

    "text": "Went to Big Jim cause Guy went there before and there is not too much individual diner on yelp close by. Ok, the let's go, have a average expectation, Guy's recommendation bottom line is edible and sometimes have surprise, but not this time.  Atmosphere is good like an average diner but places is not clean, carpet smells  and  table is sticky, that's ok, food should be good.  Me and my wife order the Steak Hoagie, comes with salad and the Spaghetti and meat sauce with 2 meat ball extra.  Salad came first, it is a mix wit shredded iceberg lettuce, grape style tiny tomato, some purple cabbage with home salad dressing. Lettuce is DARK, BAD and MUSSY, since I was on vacation, I worry I had stomach ache so I skip it.  The Steak Hoagie for five buck I give a 2 thumbs up, bread is soft, hot and toast on spot, although the mayo on the sandwich is quite a bit, the outcome balance the steak with fresh sliced tomato, some shredded iceberg lettuce.   then question coming, how come the salad iceberg lettuce are so sucks, pls prepare as per order instead, it is not a fast food joint  Last and I never come back is the meat ball the Spaghetti and meat sauce, I don't know how to describe how could it be like this, I am pretty sure Guy's taste bud is excellent, no doubt !!! but this is too much and hit my bottom line for food, spaghetti is ok, not too soggy, just a little more watery, About the meat sauce is ok but taste like can sauce and fresh tomato and shredded meat mix together, still ok, edible, I will give a pass BUT THE MEAT BALL, OMG, taste like....1) it is mussy, pretty bland 2) it taste weird, then I try to smells, it ...OMG, I threw all of them on the plate, it smells like shit....it either over cook or something wrong.  At the end of today, I did went to washroom 2 times.....I am pretty sure I will not come back.",

I play basketball at the hoops courts down in the Run and often will stop by Big Jim's afterward to get some much needed sustenance.   The portions are huge and almost everything is good. The last time I was there I got the Reuben and it did not disappoint. Stacked high with meat and good tasting and I think it was only around 8 dollars.   The service at the bar isn't all that attentive, but by no means is poor. It is exactly what you would expect at a place like this. If you are looking for a fancy night out this surely isn't the place, but it is absolutely perfect for what it is. Cheap food and drinks in huge portions.",

    "text": "Take a step back with me:   The year, circa 1985. When the family Chevy wagon heads out on a Saturday afternoon jaunt from the Pittsburgh suburbs with all 5 kids in tow, we all know that, while the zoo/museum/ballgame is going to be fun, the highlight is going to be the dinner stop at Big Jim's. After which the overloaded sky-blue Impala (with its overloaded occupants), will lumber back onto the parkway east, stuffed and homeward bound... Yeah, my old man was thrifty (5 kids will do that to you), this was about all of the dining out we ever did as a family. But he certainly had taste!   I can proudly say I have been enjoying Big Jim's for more than 20 of my 30 years... as good now as it was then (or better, as I can now share in the pitchers).   I'm glad to see that the other Yelp reviews here treat it as it should be treated, not as haute cuisine (some other online reviews questioned the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which appear to have been last sanitized shortly before I started going there. This was also the last time the condom dispenser was replenished, judging by the written descriptions), but as what it truly is: your yinzer cousin's woodgrained-laminate basement rec-room, only with fantastic, gigantic portions of Pittsburgh comfort food, served by friendly folks...    If you simply want your mind boggled at shear food quantity, go with one of the calzones every time. The \"Big Jim\" named for the now-deceased founder (I have seen this man, he was indeed not small), has a small deli-case worth of cured meats inside, and is served hanging over the edges of a large pizza tray. I myself am not a small man, and this dish constitutes three solid meals for me.   Believe it or not, this place used to be even cheaper, the above calzone now runs the better part of 10 dollars... What can I say, I'm nearly as cheap as Dad, though it's still worth every penny.   Also, reservations are accepted for very large parties (6 or more, I think). I had to suffer through the DD role for a bachelor's party on my most recent visit, Big Jim's without beer was kinda like delicious purgatory. Though the service was, as ever, fantastic, without being the least overbearing: After it became clear I was drinking pop, a tiny, halfsize pitcher appeared next to my glass. Needless to say, many humorous \"giant calzone siting\" photos were snapped next to my mini pitcher with available cellphones...   Can't recommend it enough, one visit will make you a believer. This is the kind of place that brought me back to Pittsburgh after early-20s wanderings. Though the men's toilet is, like all good bars, not for the faint of heart!",

It's in a part of Greenfield called The Run, tucked away from main roads and traffic. Parking is super easy, the neighborhood looks a little sketch but I've ran here at night in the dark and it seems fine.  The restaurant was packed! For this location, I thought it would be pretty empty. Lots of families, relaxing and enjoying their huge dinners. We were seated right away, with people constantly checking up on us, right away we got beer and menus. I'd say we had 3 waiters as all of them made sure everything was great.   The food is home-style, comfort food - lots of hoagies, sandwiches and pasta, they have their menu online. I ordered a 2-bill sandwich: corned beef, swiss cheese, slaw and a fried egg. It was HUGE and came with more coleslaw. It sounds like they only have 4 beers on tap.  Highlight of my meal - noticing Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives poster on a wall, autographed. I'm not a huge fan of the show but still thought it pretty cool to eat at a place featured on Food Network's show!",

Obviously it was because of DD&D.So finding the place was kind of hard since I didnt know the roads that well. Once getting here I have to agree that it looks like its in a weird place or at least an old town of the area. Park in the back and go in. Nice interior, very homely feel, and they were showing the world cup which is always nice. So because I've never been here we decide to order a bundle. We order the lasagna, the buffalo chicken wings (full), a reuben sandwich, and onion rings. The lady was nice and friendly brought out some waters for my sis, cousin, and me. The wait was a while for the food but im sure everythings fresh and not just sitting there waiting. The wings looked nice, the reuben was big portioned, and my lasagna was out of this world in size. Just looking at it almost gave me acid reflux lol.  The food was good nonetheless. The truth is I would probably give this place 4 stars but I wasnt too impressed with the taste. The portions were huge, the prices were great, but I just felt something was missing from the taste. Dont get me wrong, this place would be a massive frequent if i lived in the area because of the menu and prices, but from my visit, i would give it 3.5 stars. Once i go back and try some other dishes I would gladly revise my rating.",

Someone on Yelp said it was big as a head - yeah, they weren't kidding. This lasagna was huge and boy was it good. I give it a 4 out of 5, although I'm not sure if they could do much more to improve it - I think they should add another type of cheese to the top to make it a tad more flavorful, but that's my take.  My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were not as big as I expected, but their slightly spicy flavor was really awesome. The pasta and garlic bread were just right too.   All right so the food has me around 5 stars, but why the 4? Well, I could handle being in a shady part of town and the overall dark, dreary character of the place, cause as Guy said on Triple D it's a Dive - fine. But at these type of places I expect really good service from friendly people. Well, we had 2 servers - one was friendly but really difficult to get over to the table and the other was less likely to come around without being harassed and also seemed annoyed with everyone there.  For the out-of-towners deciding between Big Jim's and something like Primanti Bros, go with Big Jim's - seriously.",

As the night went on the whole place filled up. I didn't have much expectation as to what the place looked like and I'm glad... It was definitely a dive, but a hidden gem.   We got nachos and cheese for an appetizer and the portion was huge. It took a little while for our food to come out even after we were completely done with our appetizer. However, we had a small child with us and they were good about bringing her food out first.  I got the chicken Parmesan hoagie. It was huge! A half of it would be comparable to a whole hoagie other places. It was pretty good. My husband had the open faced roast beef sandwich and fries and his friend had the roast beef au jus. They both liked their dishes, but thought the roast beef was a bit overdone. The gravy on the sandwich was amazing! Our other friend had the Reuben and it was the best Reuben I've ever had!!  Our server was extremely attentive. We thought the portions were extremely generous for the price and we will definitely be back!",

So we were driving around trying to find a place to eat. Finally we ended up at this place. We had been on quite a journey and we were starving so we were excited to eat. The outside is all brick with two Mary statues in the small section of grass. We had no idea what to expect.  We went in and were greeted by several employees. You could sit in the bar or dining area. We sat in the bar. We decided we were going to share food. The food on the menu was American traditional. We went for a white pizza and a Reuben. Their prices were really cheap so we were curious how our food would be.  The pizza came out first. It looked wonderful. It tasted wonderful!  Sometimes white pizza can be bland but this was not the case here. It was some of the best white pizza I've ever had.  Then the Reuben came. It m, too, looked good. We didn't hesitate to dig in. They put the Thousand Island spread on the side. We slathered it on and took a bite. WOWZA!  Best Reuben, hands down.  The food was so good we wanted to order more just to try it but we were beyond full. I went home and told my family I had a new place to go as a family.",

    "text": "If you follow me on the rest of my social media (HITTofMCM) then you've been waiting for this review.  I know that you come to Yelp to find out about the actual product, the Food, and I'll get to that, but Big Jims isn't just about the food no matter how good it is, it's about what this place stands for.  Living in Pittsburgh my whole life I can't believe I've never been.  The building has been in the GreenField Run since the early 1900's but the restaurant opened in 1977.  I've eaten at a lot of places, I've BEEN to a lot of places, but sitting in Big Jims waiting for my food I couldn't help but feel at home, even a bit emotional from the love oozing from this place.    I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having a gentlemen by the name of Scott serve me my Bahama Mama.  He started there in 1997 and said he could never see himself working for anyone else even before they appeared on the famous food show DINERS, DRIVE INS AND DIVES.  He asked me about myself and what I do and I told him about IM SO BURGH and other things all while he tended to everyone who was there and everyone who came in as if they were all one big family.  He knew everyone by name, he knew what some people wanted before they ordered it and he and all the staff operated in a way that wasn't overly friendly and fake but, honest a bit exhausted from life and always with a smile just like it would be at home after a long day.  I told him all my Facebook family encouraged me to come here after I posted how I wanted the best Reuben Sandwich I could find in the city of Pittsburgh.  While I waited for the food he pointed out they are going through a bit of a revitalization getting new carpet put in, painting tiles and changing walls as if it was renovations in his own home.  He pointed out photos of before they were open and a big portrait of Big Jim himself looking all Tony Soprano.  He appeared to be a man who got respect and gave it just the same.  If I based this review alone on my experience and atmosphere it would get 5 stars but then my food came and as I write this, I wish Yelp had a 6 star system.  My Reuben entered my place at the bar like a prize winning champion.  The Rye bread was toasted just enough to give it that crisp texture but not too much.  The sauerkraut and Swiss was just right and the thousand island dressing was just enough to marinate and flavor but the star of any Reuben is the meat and this didn't disappoint.  Thinly shaved, grilled just right with not a moment of chewiness or toughness it melted in your mouth all the way to the last bite.  Everything on the sandwich played its role like a team of ingredients should, and just in case I liked a little more Thousand Island, without even asking Scott made sure I had it right by my plate.  Each bite made me a little bit more sad because I knew it was coming to an end.  Like a night out with good friends that you wish lasted forever, that's how I felt about my closing time with this Reuben, Scott and Big Jims as a whole.  I'll be back.  I promised them that. Once to take my woman to dinner and a third time to spread the word with friends.  The fourth time though, I'll need another solo visit to recapture that first visit feel all over again.  If you're from Pittsburgh or just visiting skip the chain places and head to Big Jims, they have something for everyone.",

It has that dive bar/diner feel with a large banquet-ish room on the side for those classier folks. The portions are out of control and the flavor of the food isn't compromised. The first time here, I ordered the famous veal Parmesan sandwich which apparently Guy Fieri had on Diner's and Dives. It took me three days to eat it all and it was only 13 bucks! My wife ordered a sausage calzone that was the size of a toddler. The next time we went we had pizza and it was awesome as well. The customer service is always great and the people are very friendly. Definitely check out Big Jim's",

Big Jim's makes it worth investigating.  This is place is the quintessential Pittsburgh dive, but the red Italian is amazeballs.    We split a bowl of the wedding soup with was easily the best version that I have ever had. The escarole really makes it.  I had the chicken parmesan dinner. The included salad was forgettable but the entree was  great. Large crisp chicken breast smothered in a borderline inappropriate amount of cheese.  I got the pasta and it was a little overcooked but serviceable.  My meal was large enough to split with someone but what came next was just downright dirty.  The calzone is at Big Jim's is ridiculous.  It needs to come with a warning other than that it takes 45 minutes.  I am not kidding these calzones could double as tomatoey warming blankets for italian newborns.  My wife and I couldn't come close to finish this.  As for the service, I would like to call it, Pittsburgh friendly. Meaning that in any other city you would assume your server was rude and incompetent but in Pittsburgh it is normal.  Just now what you want before your server gets there.  Bottom line, this place is a dive in the BEST way.  Take the time to get to the run.",

We make it a point to hit some Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives when we're on vacation with the kids, and agree with the previous reviewer the Guy missed the mark on this one.  While the portions are \"generous\" to say the least, the food was only \"good.\" My husband and I split the Chicken Parm Hoagie...good, not great. The standout of this sandwich was the hoagie roll...it was amazing. To accompany the sandwich I ordered a dinner salad, my husband the wedding soup. Again, good not great. My son ordered the roast beef and au jus sandwich. Like our sandwich it was enormous and served on an awesome roll, but the awesome stopped there. It was really bland, and the au jus, even more so. However our little one ordered buttered noodles and was pleased as punch. For what's worth, the old school, off the beaten path character of the building was kind of charming. But you can't eat that.  If your goal is a lot of food at a cheap price, this is your stop. If you're looking for an \"off the hook\" dining experience, drive on.",

My husband and I had watched the episode earlier in the week and were feeling Italian so we decided to make the short hike from South Side. I ordered a bowl of Wedding Soup and half of a meatball hoagie. He ordered the lasagna. The meatballs are good and the hoagie hit the spot, largely due to the bread and melted cheese. The wedding soup is delicious! Neither of us were impressed by the lasagna. There wasn't much flavor / seasoning aside from the sauce which is a little on the safe \"no indigestion afterwards\" side.  The portions are generous and the atmosphere is definitely divey with late 70's decor and a dedicated clientele of local regulars. I would say it's a great place for a sandwich, soup and a beer. I was eyeing up the jumbo wings someone at the bar ordered. I would definitely give Big Jim's another shot.",

How often can you say you've been to a place where you're satisfied in your belly and happy with the price you paid?   The Italian wedding soup was homemade and incredibly tasty.  Don't expect a fancy presentation, but know you're getting homemade soup.  The salads leave much to be desired, but the house made Italian dressing made me gobble up the lettuce adorned with two olives and one cherry tomato.   On to the main dish--definitely order the veal parmigiana dinner AND the meatballs with spaghetti. The veal was hot and fresh!  Meatballs were moist and jumbo sized.   We truly enjoyed our meal.  Actually, we were curious to try dessert--but the server informed us that they don't offer any sweets because no one can ever finish their plate!!!   Love it and will definitely be back!!!  Thanks Guy Fieri!!!",

We where a little nervous, but soon as we were stumbling out of our UberCar, a heavyset lady, runs out of the place and starts yelling at her husband to put on his big boy pants..  \"It's not a biker bar and... No bikers don't like to ride at 20 degrees when it's snowing.. I saw a DDD sticker on the door and knew we were in the right place. Not too many people in the joint, people checked us out more than us checking them out... Us because we actually dressed in dressy casual and the were dressed casual dressy. Sit wherever you wasn't fellows... CE waiter comes gets us some Big Jim Brew.... And it was pretty good beer.... Big Jim is starting to grow on me. My two friends still didn't know what this place is.. I ordered three Big Jim Ales, and we all start enjoying. I ordered the Reuben Sandwich... It came with toasted pumpernickel bread a hefty portion of meat and the same for the sauerkraut. Best I've ever tasted, even comparing with Manhattan Delis.....

When you walk into Big Jim's, you look like you're walking into an abandoned dive bar,   It's not so clean, you can see the dust blowing around in the air, and there is 30 years of wear and tear, and the decor is a mix of old italian restaurant and catholic church.  the tables and chairs are ugly, and usually kinda sticky.  Now that's out of the way, lets talk about service.  Abysmal.  There is one, two servers tops in the place, and you can wait up to 20 minutes to get drinks.  The food takes a bit of time as well due to the short staff, but this is standard in a dive bar/restaurant.  So you're probably saying to yourself, why did you give this place 4 stars Justin?  Weeeeelllll, the food is fantastic.  If you get a sandwich, expect it to be so big, you have to take a second, collect yourself, and formulate a plan as to how to even get this thing in your mouth.  The veal parmesan sandwich, is the size of a large dinner plate, and just stacked with fried veal (and only 11.95,  seriously?!)  The pizzas have so much cheese, it makes me want to weep.  I have never had anything on the menu that hasn't been cheap, oversized, and crazy good.  For your basic bar foods, this place is killing it.  If you don't mind waiting for it.  They have a short staff on at all times, but they're passing the savings on to you!",

The alfredo sauce is so creamy and buttery. It's better than most straight italian places in Pittsburgh. But don't be fooled this is not just an italian menu. The menu has so many different options to cater to whatever you might be craving on a particular evening. And it's all priced so incredibly reasonable. Great if you've got a couple of hungry kids you're trying to feed without breaking the bank.  And, the beer selection is pretty extensive. They've recently added a huge beer list to the bar that will satisfy everyone from the light beer lovers to the craft beer connoisseurs. Again, without breaking the bank. It really is the perfect place to spend a night out without spending your whole paycheck.   The staff is always so friendly, kind and attentive. Even if they're slammed and it takes a minute for them to serve you, they make a point to come over and let you know they're not ignoring you and will be over ASAP. It's always a treat to spend an evening at Big Jim's. Give it the highest recommendation.",

As I walked into this famed restaurant I was met with the specials scrawled on a chalkboard. After being quickly seated I ordered a bowl of Chicken and Dumplings and it was hot and delicious. After that, I ordered the fries with gravy and the veal parmigiana sandwich. The sandwich was huge (big enough that two grown men shared it as a meal) and the fries were crispy with a delicious brown gravy.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal, the atmosphere and the people at Big Jim's!",

I can squeeze three meals out of it if I pace myself. Let's talk about the decor...it's so tacky that it's awesome. Kitschy, gaudy, lovely. It's an experience to behold.

    "text": "My Family was raised in Greenfield. Great working class neighborhood, where everyone looks out and knows one another. I was never raised in Greenfield but still have family close by. Big Jim's has and always will be our family neighborhood restaurant. Big Jim's \"In The Run\" it's not a huge restaurant, not a fancy or sport bar, but it's a really friendly, welcoming restaurant without the decor and ambiance that some have. If you want to say it's a hole in the wall, ok, but it is the nicest, friendliest tastiest hole in the wall,  I have ever been too. don't judge the book by its cover. ok what I am getting at is it's not fancy. It is one of the oldest family neighborhood restaurants left in Pittsburgh.  The portions are huge. The staff is friendly, accommodating and always pleasant. They know your first name and know what you want to order when you sit down.  We have gone as a small family of 2-4 and as a large group of 15-20. I have had almost everything on the menu. I love the Chicken Parm dinner. I recommend the 1/2 LB sandwiches, either in house Roast Beef, or the Corned Beef. Family members have loved the Italian hoagie warm. We love the Chicken Parm hoagie as well. The spaghetti sauce has changed over the years, but it isn't bad. I love the in house Italian dressing, I have tried the recipe they gave me, but have not made it as good as theirs. We have never had the pizza that I can remember. You can't go wrong with anything you try. The homemade Wedding Soup bowl, is a meal in itself. Highly Recommend. See you soon!!  oh .. don't go on a high school football night. it will be hard to get a table. Central Catholic takes up the whole restaurant on friday night football nights. Waiting for a table any other night is worth it !",

    "text": "If your Pittsburgh experience has thus far been constrained to the hot trendy spots, do yourself a favor and jump out of your comfort zone and give Big Jim's a shot. This place had been on our list for years and we finally made down there. Now, I had no idea who the hell this guy from the Food Network is, but he knows a good meal when he finds one. We worked our way down to lower Greenfield to this old-school neighborhood bar and restaurant and dove in. There's always this little nervousness of being made to feel like an outsider in this kind of place, but not only was our welcome from our waiter warm and helpful, the folks seated around us were engaging and enthusiastic, making menu suggestions, cracking jokes. It was like we'd been invited into someone's house for a holiday dinner.  I got the Chicken Parm, which is literally a couple of pounds of moist, delicately breaded and fried chicken breast covered in delicious sauce and served on a bed of spaghetti. I'm a big guy who likes to eat, and it took a dedicated effort to finish half of my plate. A young man of 18 in our party, a broad-shouldered defensive tackle with a deeply ambitious attitude, was likewise stalled by his Veal parm sandwich which, it is True, is literally served on a full loaf of italian bread. The thing was bigger than his head. Literally. Mrs. Junk ordered the Reuben, which was delightful, while our final diner sat down to the insanely large and delicious calzone.   This isn't a birdseed joint--this is big food with big bold taste, served up hot and fresh in a place where everyone was happy and friendly. There should be more places like this in a world too full of strip-mall generic places like Chilis and Fridays. This is the real deal.  I note a negative review from someone who is whining about waiting for a table and dissing Greenfield, a solid working class neighborhood, as \"shady\" and I just want to say that those words are an insult. Greenfield might not be Lawrenceville or (thank god) the trendy mess that hipsters have made of East Liberty, but it is a safe and welcoming place where folks raise their families. I'll be back again and again.",

Located under a bridge in Greenfield, this unassuming bar puts out some massive portions at low prices.  I ordered an Italian sub, and my dad got the Veal Parmesan sandwich.  I had some buyer's remorse, as my Italian sub was good but not special, and the veal parm was amazing.  The veal piece was huge and the sandwich was delicious.  They do love their condiments here so ask them to go light if you roll that way  The service here is really pleasant and homey.  Not forced but nice.  It's a very old-school-Pittsburgh-y kind of restaurant.  Once arriving, my brother pointed out that they had been on Triple D.  Who knew?  (Apparently, a lot of people on Yelp, that's who.)",

    "text": "*walks in, sets down soapbox, steps upon soapbox, clears throat*  For all those people that kindly wrote a review on this place solely because you watched an episode of DDD, maybe you should have ordered exactly what was shown on the show and then left it at that.  If you are going to come here because of the show, then do exactly what they did on the show and leave it at that.  Don't bring down the whole place because what you ordered didn't look/taste like what was served on the show.  *steps down and removes the soapbox*  Now, since that is out of the way, let me move forward.  Yes, this place is a little offsetting with the way it looks.  It's a bit divey on the inside, well maybe more than a bit divey on the inside.  That is exactly what gives this place character.  It gives you the feel that you are in someones home from the 70s.  TVs are around the place, tacky pictures and mirrors line the walls, and the chairs are mismatched.  The servers kind of blend in a bit making it feel 70s more so.    The menu, even though it looks small, takes a bit to look over.  Be sure to look it over as well, you may pass up something that you really want.  I opted for the open face turkey sandwich with fries.  I was expecting to get a moderate amount of food as you do at other places, and I was fine by that.  What I got on the other hand surely surprised me.  When I saw the size of the plate, I was shocked.  It was the size of a small platter, and the whole thing was covered in food.  Two thick slices of bread, toasted and then topped with a heaping pile of turkey and then covered with gravy.  And the fries, oh my god, the fries.  They are fresh cut, on the smaller size, but still amazing.  The gravy also topped these.  It took me some time and determination, but I downed it all.  For two meals, it cost us under $20.  A meal of this caliber at any other place would definitely cost us more.  Big Jim's is definitely worth getting lost in Greenfield to find a good meal.  *Take out available with a fee.",

We were seated quickly and looked over the menu. Plenty of choices! We ended up with veal parmigiana and baked ziti with meatballs. If you can finish all you get, you have an incredible appetite. Both meals were served with several options. We picked coleslaw (pretty good) and salad. My wife loved the homemade Italian dressing. Although they don't sell it, our waitress made sure to send us home with extra. Our meals arrived within a decent time of our order and were appropriately hot. My veal parmigiana was excellent. The breading was not too heavy and had very good flavor. I could have used a little more sauce; however, it was good even without it. My wife enjoyed her meal. All three staff members we were in contact with with friendly and helpful. We couldn't have asked for a better waitress. I'd go back (probably to try the pizza ora sandwich, since they looked great)!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I woke up with a Sunday hangover around 11 am and wanted hot cheap comfort food brunch. We came across Big Jim's on yelp and immediately decided to go. So Big Jim's isn't in the sort of place where'd you think you would find an amazing dive bar and restaurant with amazing food, but it is so good! The sketchy location and outside appearance add to the experience of going here. The inside of the restaurant is very clean while still giving the Pittsburgh dive bar feel. We got water and, of course, coffee right away. The coffee comes in basically a soup bowl mug which I thought was the perfect size and really charming. I ordered the hot open faced turkey sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Rueben sandwich. They both came extremely fast and were SO HUGE. No joke, these entrees are so large and well worth the price around $10. We both had at least half of our meals for leftovers to take home. The food was delicious and exactly what we needed. We were so pleased that we went back the same week for dinner and drinks! This place is so classic Pittsburgh for cheap huge amounts of food and good brews. Highly recommend and we will be back on the reg!",

    "text": "After cycling past Big Jim's hundreds of times over the past couple of years, I finally paid a visit this past Sat. evening at 6:30.  When a friend who enjoys large portions on the cheap wanted to go somewhere for dinner, Amanda J.'s review from last week reminded me of Big Jim's, so I suggested that we try it.  Although I've always noticed several cars nearby, I was surprised at how busy it was when we stopped by.  We had to wait for a table, but we were seated in only about 5 min.  In looking at the drink menu, I noticed a cocktail called the Big Jim's cidre which appeared to be a spiced apple cider-like drink, so I decided to try it ($7.50).  I'm glad that I did, since it tasted just like a spiced apple cider with a buzz, complete with a cinnamon stick and cinnamon sugar on the rim.  It was delicious, and I could drink them all day (and night), but as it were, I showed some restraint and stuck to one.  For food, I decided to go with the open faced turkey sandwich ($10.99), since the weather was cool and wet and I was in the mood for some comfort food.  It consisted of sliced roast turkey on bread and fries covered with gravy.  It reminded me vaguely of a similar roast turkey special that my college cafeteria used to serve, minus the mashed potatoes.  Nevertheless, it was pretty tasty, and definitely hit the spot for comfort food.  The one major drawback was the fries, which were clearly fried in old oil, given that they had a bitter taste.  Fortunately, the gravy helped to mask the bitterness, though.  My friend ordered the large fish sandwich ($9.99), which consisted of two huge pieces of fish on a large bun, as well as a large side of cole slaw.  The cole slaw was of the creamy variety, and contained so much mayo that it formed a pool as he ate the slaw.  He ate 75% of the fish and the bun, which impressed me, given the portion size.  Like most customers, we both took home leftovers.  Overall, I was generally pleased with my experience at Big Jim's.  The clientele was definitely on the older side, and struck me as mostly consisting of Greenfield locals.  As others have said, this isn't an ideal date location due to the (lack of) decor, but it's perfectly fine for a casual dinner of comforting food on the cheap.  I'm awarding 3.5 stars because of the gross fries, but if Big Jim's could solve this problem, I'd go with a 4 instead.  While I probably won't rush back soon, I enjoyed my meal and would return the next time I'm in the mood for comfort food.",

    "text": "Amid the modern scene of strip mall restaurant chains and tired cliches masquerading as innovative establishments, Big Jim's is a refreshing surprise. For those of us who were children in the 70s or 80s, a visit to Big Jim's becomes a bit of a time warp back to childhood. It's divey, dark, and the decor probably hasn't changed since the place opened in 1977. In other words, it's pretty freaking awesome.  If time warping to the late 70s isn't enough for you, how about giant portions of delicious comfort food? Bring your appetite and a friend. The meals here are immense. My husband, 3-year-old daughter, and I all shared a chicken parm sandwich and I still had a little piece of my portion to bring home. The chicken was tender and generously topped with flavorful marinara and melted cheese. Oh, and the bread. Can't forget the bread. The sandwich is served on a crusty half loaf of delicious Italian bread.   Overall, I think this place is great. Bear in mind that the criticisms of other reviewers - digs about the decor or the uniforms - were positive in my book. I love that this place has likely never been renovated. If it were to be renovated, I probably would never go back. I like time travel.  Oh, and as a side note, Big Jim's was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Take that as you will. If you pride yourself on visiting places that are featured on television shows, then put this on your list. If not, still put this restaurant your list because it's a funky place straight out of the 70s with excellent food.   Happy time traveling!",

I think the sauce is tasteless and when I ordered the lasagna, it was cold in the middle. Not just undercooked, but cold! So, if you go on a good night, the food is great.

    "text": "My dad lived in Greenfield  for a time during his reckless, Dead End Kids youth and for years has spoken well of Big Jim's and of the godlike sandwiches they serve. Watching it become nationally famous through Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" was exciting, surreal, and made me all the more anxious to stop by.   Shockingly, Kay had this place bookmarked for months! The other night, we decided to put off a visit no longer.   Unassuming during the day, ominous after dark, Big Jim's occupies a building that sits below a poorly-lit underpass in a portion of the neighborhood known as \"The Run.\"   When you walk in, however, you are greeted graciously like a longtime friend and fed lovingly with hefty helpings of food that runs the gamut from bar and diner fare to good old Sunday evening homestyle cooking.   It was the latter path that Kay chose with her Italian Wedding Soup and Hot Roast Beef Sandwich entree. The sandwich was a mountain of beef, bread, gravy, and fries that poor Kay only halfway finished.   Dad recommended either the Italian Hoagie or the Bacon Burger. Thankfully, I listened to reason and didn't attempt to devour both, so I just went with the burger and was rewarded with an archetypal patty that was burly, copiously juicy, criminally fresh, and sublimely cooked to my specifications. In fact, EVERYTHING about this burger was open-faced perfection, from the veggies and sharp, solid, chilly, dill pickle to a bun so blessedly baked and brand-new, my imagination led me to believe that it had sprung from the ovens of Shangri-La. All hail Big Jim's Bacon Burger. Its place in the pantheon has been quickly secured.   However, their fries, served in an insurmountable heap along with all else on their menu, need work. Brown, greasy, and limp, I've honestly had better fries at Eat N Park. I coulda, shoulda ordered onion rings. Oy.  Remember kids, cut them fresh, change the oil regularly, fry them twice.   The atmosphere was very casual, talkative, and family-oriented, and the service was friendly, speedy, and graceful; our waiter didn't miss a beat in spite of how busy the restaurant was.   I'll certainly be back for that Italian Hoagie. Until then...  P.S. Who didn't know that a framed picture of Guy Fieri would be on the wall?",

It's probably not good for you to eat here too often, but it was fun for lunch.  It definitely falls in the \"Dives\" category of Guy Fieri's show.  My mom and wife split a chicken parm sandwich (photo attached).  My bro-in-law had a meatball hoagie (also photo attached).  I had the Italian hoagie and we also split some fries with sides of cheese and gravy.  Everything was sinfully tasty.  We rolled out the door to the car and went home and napped.",

    "text": "Really Guy? You endorsed this place on Triple D? You put your reputation on the line and did a segment on Big Jim's? I wasn't impressed with the food at all. The service was worse.                                 I ordered a half veggie hoagy and a bowl of vegetable soup. My friend Ross ordered a small pizza and a bowl of wedding soup. I was sipping on a pretty good Rooney pale ale which was the best part of the meal. A little while later our soup came in cups. We told the bartender we ordered bowls. Oops. I was fighting a cold and a nice hot bowl of vegetable soup would hit the spot. Still waiting for the soup, out came the pizza, looked good, tons of cheese and pepperoni, and my veggie hoagy.  My order was wrong again, I ordered a half and they gave me a whole Hoagy. No biggie, I'll take the other half home for a midnight snack. Still no sign of the soup! It was a pretty unremarkable hoagy. Lots of flavorless lettuce, green peppers, onion, and huge unchewable chunks of carrots, and worse, it was cold. I Was kind of hoping for some eggplant, roasted red peppers, grilled zucchini, you know a real veggie hoagy with some flavor and texture. Oh we'll, live and learn. Still no soup! Finally the bartender was finished watching TV and saw we were both out of beer, and I asked about the soup, he apologized and said he forgot. I said to Ross, I guess he must make a good hourly wage because he's not working for a good tip. Finally our soup was delivered and I pushed away that lousy hoagy and dived into soup. I blew on the spoonful of soup and Ross said \"you don't have to do that, it's cold.\" Damn! With a half eaten hoagy and a full bowl of soup sitting there, I asked for the check and paid and left. Never again Big Jim, never again! Guy, you lost points on this call.",

    "text": "The only reason I want to try this little dive tucked away on a barely lit street was because my dear dad saw it listed in one of his cooking magazines since it had been featured on DDD (you know the show I mean). I wish I knew what Guy recommended so I could decided what to try from the massive selection! I am not a burger person, but the hot pot roast and fries with gravy sounded pretty good to me! When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn't finish it. For the price, the portion size alone is a value!  I did also order Wedding soup. Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh, The soup itself was very delicious. Not bland and with few meatballs (which is FINE with me!). At least I didn't have to ask for the Parmesan cheese, the server brought it out with the soup.  My meal itself was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut. The beef didn't have much flavor, but the gravy helped this. The fries, sadly, tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly. At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes, but Darren pointed out the oil problem.  Another comment, WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS??? If you aren't from Pittsburgh I think you'll be shocked at the rudeness. Darren seems used to it (swearing that \"they aren't being rude\")...and if this is what you get used to here, I am heartbroken. Is friendly service too much to ask for?  If I decide to come back, I will try a different sandwich.",

Add on bar standards plus huge deli sandwiches and fresh cut fries, yeah, kinda like that... Servers amazingly friendly;  kitchen on point, you can even use your card to pay in this joint! Wheezy? No problem in here, you'll find nobody smoking while you're drinking your beer. Yup smoke free and takes plastic!! A Greenfield Run Gem! We like it so much we've gone over and over again!

It's kinda uncomfortable sitting at the bar to eat your food the way the bar is designed, so your food isn't in a great position for you to eat so you might wanna sit at a table instead.",

He likes eating at restaurants that make him feel like he is at home in Florida, eating what his mother would make for him. I prefer trying something different and saving the home style dishes to my mom. Big Jim's is a place where we both agree. It is delicious!  The first thing that I would like to point out are the prices. Almost everything is under $10. Even when i am at home ordering food for myself I am usually spending $20. But the prices at Big Jim's are undeniably fair.   The food is definitely more home style than what I usually am after but the wedding soup is perfect and the chicken parm sandwich is perfectly crispy and saucy and cheesy and delicious. It is also the size of my head (which is quite the big, roundish dome).   The place is always packed but the service does not suffer. The beer list is also surprisingly awesome! All around, a great place to eat!",

He also had jalapeno poppers and cole slaw which he says they were good. My only complaint is that my long island ice tea was not made right. All bartenders should know how to make a good long island. The kids meal is as big as an adult dinner at other restaurants.",

The portions are huge but its the quality that keeps me going back. A great neighborhood restaurant tucked away \"in the run\". The chicken wings are whole and meaty and cooked perfectly.

    "text": "My friend said this place was on triple D and he wanted to try it so we ended up going.    Big Jim's in the Run is essentially right in the middle of a residential zone.  It doesn't really feel like you are walking into a business at first because of the area you drove through to get there.  You will most likely end up parking on the street in front of somebody's home nearby.  This place has what I call quintessential \"American Italian\".  What that means is that it's not necessarily Italian but rather Americanized Italian food which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's just not the same.    The first thing you will notice is that the decor is very simple.  This place is the last \"D\" in the title of the show, \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  This place is a dive and it's part of the charm of the place.  They are not trying to be anything outside of what they are besides themselves which is what makes this place genuine.    The servings at this place are really large in that one dish can maybe feed 2 people.  If each of your party orders a dish you will most likely not finish your meal.  The salads are huge, the bread comes to the table at first the entrees will fill you up big time.  The food at the same time is good as well.    The lasagna has A LOT of ricotta in it... almost too much.  The veal sandwich I ordered was almost the size of the plate!    All that being said it's not a lot of money for a lot of food.  While it's not the greatest Italian food I've had it's one of the better American Italian food places I've eaten at and I can't say you leave hungry because the portions are beyond generous to the point of being family sized.  The service was very welcoming and friendly.",

It's hard to find good wedding soup in a restaurant; it's usually either bland or too salty. But Big Jim's gets it just right. They're other dishes are equally yummy and the portions are always huge. Love the pasta with white clam sauce - so many clams!  Have also eaten the gnocchi but ordered it with a marinara rather than the meat sauce. They took a bit long to cook but were well worth the wait. Also, all pasta dishes come with a yummy warm and buttery garlic toast! Have also tried steak sandwich and the premium grilled chicken sandwich which are both also good. The bread is fabulous.   Have never been hungry enough for dessert but I'm sure it would rock.",

We had a bit of a wait because there were 8 of us and they had to put a few tables together, but didn't have any close enough when we arrived. The wait was totally worth it. Our waitress was Heather and she was great! She had the best memory, as she didn't write one order down. That always makes me nervous and puts a lot of pressure on the waitress. But she totally knocked the service out of the park! She didn't get one thing wrong- which is awesome. The food was great! The dinners were huge and tasty. The lasagna was probably the size of my head and the meatballs probably the size of my fist. They give you a lot of food for a decent price! I like we have definitely discovered a gem and can't wait to go back!",

Driving through the area it would be easy to miss Big Jim's.  The outside of it makes it look like that it's more of a community bar. We weren't really greeted when we came in and stood at the front for a few minutes before I asked someone if we sat ourselves or needed to be seated.   The food was really great and the prices were indeed very fair. The employees need to do a better job at cleaning up tables and debris left at other tables from patrons who have already left. Sitting next to tables full of dirty plates wasn't ideal.",

I ordered gnocchi, meatballs in marinara, and something else that I cannot remember (which is unfortunate because it was so good!) Their meatballs were enormous, delicious, and filling! I believe what made them so tasty was the marinara sauce, which they knocked out of the ball park! Gnocchi was cooked well, soft and chewy, not mushy. Garlic bread was an absolute favorite of mine, especially with the marinara sauce!   The one thing I didn't like was having the food coma after the meal and literally going into hibernation for the rest of the day, but I'm really just trying to shift the blame for my gluttony. As with any Italian food goes, it can all get a little heavy with all the carbs and meat sauces. Overall, a place I would go back to!",

It is so far off the path that you never remember it's there (I am old and forget things if I don't see them). Well it was crowded on a Sunday evening at 7pm - that was a good first sign. The outside is nothing fancy...looks like a dive. Our server Heather was the first part of this experience that got my attention. She took our drink order and wrote nothing down. She answered all our questions at the very beginning and was so kind and pleasant. When we placed our dinner order she still wasn't writing down and got everything perfect!!  They offer a big bowl of coleslaw with your meal if you don't want a salad. The cole slaw was very creamy. Then the main event.  I remember hearing their meatballs were a big attraction, I ordered the meatball parmigiana.... flabbergasted is the word that describes my reaction to that plate being placed in front of me. It was massive!  Those could have been the best meatballs I ever had. They were not tough or tight but rather loose and soft. Good balance of garlic salt and other flavors.  Yummy!!    The lasagne was epic and everyone tasted it and loved the flavors.  The garlic toast is yummy and the service good!  I think Big Jim's will be added to our repertoire!!  A truly Pittsburgh kinda place!",

Every single human that works here is friendly, knows the menu back and forth, and can make an intelligent conversation.   Best friend Emma and I came here on a Saturday night near the end of happy hour in December. Josh's suggestion, and I'm so glad he knew this place.   The menu is huge. Sandwiches, salads, pasta, and your traditional greasy bar grub. Emma had a hankering for cheese sticks, and I asked Tim, the barkeep, what he suggested for my starter. He said Fried Zucchini. Man, he was speaking my language. After a short wait; everything was steaming in front of us. Emma's cheese sticks were just that, but still melty and delicious. Those zucchini planks though. WOW. Tim said they hand bread them to order, and slice them fresh everyday. You could tell. And their ranch was amazing too.   Then came the sandwiches. I got the Roast Beef Au Jus. HOLY CATS this sandwich is large. Emma decided on a steak hoagie with lettuce, ranch, and tomato. She loved it. The bread was toasted just right on both sandwiches. Mine was apparently the last roast beef to be served that day, and I'm so glad I got it before they ran out. That sandwich was good. Even hours later as leftovers, Josh said it was great.   Find this place. Go. Now. Sit at the bar. Get food. Get happy. Tip your bartender.   Happy Eating!",

It really defines Pittsburgh to me before a lot of people from out of town started to pour in. It is a family restaurant.   Their portions are enormous. They are not located in a ritzy part of town on the rise. The decor is absolutely just okay. But it is a very fun place to be. If you want to eat a lot of pasta or nice eggplant parmesan dinner, relax and unwind; you came to the right place.   I ordered the baked ziti and it came with soup or salad and garlic bread. Everything was pretty plain but you could add as much dressing or salt as you would like. My ziti dish was bigger than my head and covered with cheese. Needless to say, we took home serious leftovers.",

I had the veal parm sandwich and wanted to also try the meatballs. The veal parm sandwich was nothing short of fantastic, and the meatballs were a little piece of heaven! Soft meatballs, not the hard frozen kind, and a great recipe. Sauce is also worth noting because that was awesome as well. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some Big Jim's! Thank me later fellow yelpers...",

    "text": "I am still in amazement about the concept and location of this place.  Never hearing or knowing anything about Big Jim's certainly made my first visit here extra special.  I felt as if I was going on a mini adventure as I traveled down the slope to get there.  My first impression and thoughts upon seeing it was that this place is Pittsburgh through and through! I mean there is a gigantic bridge hovering over it!  It looks like a scene right out of The Deer Hunter. Entering the place was another experience.  It was a warm April evening so there were a couple of locals hanging out on the corner to complete the scene.  Once inside I couldn't believe the number of people who were dining, and the levels of activity taking place here on a Friday.  I was almost getting dizzy from all of the various motions swarming around me.  This place is not for amateurs or for anyone who is claustrophobic.  You must enjoy outdated decor, wood paneling and eclectic collections. On one side of the room is a statue of the Virgin Mary and on the other wall has a hanging beer promo sign. Did I mention that Guy Fieri featured Big Jim's on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives?  His picture is on the wall as well.  The menu is something to study carefully since according to those who were dining with me everything is served in huge portions and tastes excellent.  I tend to be a little more skeptical with such advice so I usually try to order something I cannot order anywhere else. However, the more I looked the more I realized that the easiest thing to do was to order a draft beer and a steak hoagie and just simply plan multiple trips here in order to try a little bit of everything!  The food, service, and atmosphere is certainly a treasure to be repeated.",

The place itself reminded me of an old Philadelphia corner bar- kinda dark and simply appointed. Mixed review on service as our waiter was real short on conversation whereas the barmaid was super friendly.  Would definitely go back if I found myself in Pitt again.",

We ordered a whole chic parm, a whole cheese steak and an order of fried zucchini.  It took a little longer than the half hour I was told but the food was worth the wait.  The chic parm was 2 full fried chic breasts covered w sauce & cheese and the steak was restaurant grade shaved sirloin.  $11 each and well worth it.

Bill and i saw this joint on Triple D with Guy Fieri , and we had to experience it for ourselves. Thats where the problem began. First off, we Had to wait in line at a dive bar in a shady part of town for 30 minutes!!!! Then,  when we finally were seated, we noticed that the dish washer from the back was taking our drink order, (which took forever to get back to us!!! Doesnt anyone know what pete's wicked ale is???? MORONS!!!!) Dont even get me started on the food, which took a over an hour to make and get to our table. The wedding soup was a joke!!! too salty, Ive had better... I dont know... If you like to wait around for your food, then this is the place for you, ( they do have take out, i dont know how long that would take to make though....)  So basically, We spent over 2 hours in this place in which this is time we will never get back. Btw, thanks for wasting our time.... we know better now",

    "text": "Like many others reviewing Big Jim's, I was inspired to try it after seeing the Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives episode in which it was featured. Based on what I saw on the show, and what I had read on Yelp, I knew to expect huge portions and the \"homey\" (to put it nicely) decor. Indeed, it was decorated like a suburban grandparents basement, but it actually was kind of charming.  I went with my husband and a friend one Friday night a few weeks ago. We got there around 7pm and it was crowded but we did not have to wait for a table. Unlike many reviewers here, our service was definitely not slow; a waitress was almost immediately at the table to take drink orders (before we all got a chance to look through the menu) and made herself available throughout the meal, frequently checking in with us.   I really wanted to try the meatballs, which had been showcased on DDD. I ordered two as an appetizer (husband and friend ordered jalapeno poppers, of which I am not a fan and did not try. They claimed they were tasty). The meatballs were quite delicious and so was the accompanying sauce. I could tell both were homemade, and enjoyed the sauce so much that even when I had finished the meat, I scraped up the rest of the sauce with my fork to finish it all.   For dinner I ordered a hot sausage calzone. The waitress told me that it would take about 30 minutes to cook, and since we ordered apps I didn't care. Again, I knew from watching DDD that the portion would be ridiculous, and it was: it was as if someone took a large pizza and folded it in half. It really was that big. But, I can say this as a hard-core foodie and a self-labeled gourmand, it was the best damn calzone I have ever eaten. Hands down; no contest. The dough was thin and crisp and perfectly, uniformly browned. In general, my critique about calzones is that there is often way too much cheese (I am not a fan of tons and tons of cheese), but this calzone had the proporations down perfectly: fresh delicious fillings of sausage, peppers and onions, and a smattering of cheese to tie it all together. The sausage was indeed spicy, sliced thinly and bursting with flavor. The onion and peppers appeared to have been roasted first, then thinly sliced, which also added an unexpected dimension of flavor.  A winner. And we had enough calzone left over to eat throughout the rest of the weekend.   My husband ordered a reuben sandwich which he said was really good, and our friend ordered the immense veal parm sandwich which she described as delicious.   I will definitely go back to Big Jim's. I want to try other things on the menu but I am already craving that calzone again.   Seriously: this place is worth the trip and I can now see why people rave about it. I am only giving it four stars because of the decor. Yes: I get it, you're homey and dive-y and unpretentious, yadda yadda, but if someone spent 2 hours sprucing the interior of that place up, it would make a huge difference.",

It's actually kind of refreshing that this place stands solely on it's food. We had the wedding soup which was phenomenal. It was filled with delicious meatballs, pieces of chicken and had a great flavor! We also had a pizza and split an order of meatballs. The meatballs and the marinara that they came in were quite tasty, and left us wanting more. While the pizza was very good, we wished we had ordered some pasta after admiring our neighbor's choices. We will definitely return for another tasting session sometime soon. The wait staff was efficient but not overly friendly. They were spread a bit thin and seemed to have a way of doing things that didn't always put the customer's needs first. But, again, the food stands on it's own, and if that's what you are going there for, then you will certainly not be disappointed!",

Lots of beer options and staff that are personally invested in the success of the restaurant make Big Jim's an awesome neighborhood staple.

Both look like they haven't been remodeled since he 70s? Not looking good for me.  We ordered drinks - we got the big Jim special brew that's made just for them - REALLY GOOD! Kind of a mixture of yuengling and Killians Irish red if I had to describe it.   I decided to get the chicken parm, my husband got the two bills sandwich, and my son got the kids cheeseburger and fries. Pictures are worth a thousand words. Please look at them haha! We both said that we wouldn't b able to go to the grocery store and buy ingredients to make what we had for the price, and we wouldn't have made it as good. Usually if you get quantity, quality lacks, but you get both here! Oh, almost forgot. Side salad was really good - highly recommend the Parmesan peppercorn!!! Garlic bread is really good too.   Will we be back? Absolutely! Service was adequate and I have now come to realize the location and atmosphere are actually part of the whole experience! So good!!!",

Kind of conveniently located off the far end of the Jail Trail bike path, it's a delicious place to take a sandwich and beer break on your healthy lifestyle quest. :)   On my list for destination places for a good fish sandwich in Pittsburgh, I think all of their sandwiches are just as good and don't think you can go wrong with most items on their menu. I love their gravy too on sandwiches, mashed potatoes and fries.   I like their Italian wedding soup, their giant meatballs served with spaghetti or bun, their warm and cozy open faced roast beef sandwich, and their big cold cheap pitchers of beer. I have never ever regretted a trip to Big Jim's.   It's a nothing fancy place with good food and big portions. I think you get extra points for finding your way there. Just found out Guy Fieri from that food show filmed at Big Jim's on a Pittsburgh trip and put them on the foodie radar. Must be good, right? Ha ha.",

    "text": "Big Jim's smaller than other restaurants and the decor is not much to write home about, but they do have flat screen televisions in the both dining room and bar if you're into that.  The parking can be tricky, because they don't have a parking lot and the restaurant is situated on the edge of crowded neighborhood, whose resident all use street parking for their own vehicles.   Their Italian wedding soup is solid, even though it doesn't have noodles in it, which I'm used to. I love that they use escarole instead of spinach, because it holds up in the broth better.   The veal Parmesan sandwich is what gets people in the door, 1) because Guy Fieri ate it, and  2) because it's monstrous and delicious. I myself don't like veal but at least one person at the table, normally my dad, always orders it and takes at least 1/2 home. And taking half home is worth mentioning because my dad knows how to EAT and he still has enough for another meal!  I have had the meatball sandwich which is huge and the meatballs are delicious, with plenty of sauce to keep them from drying out. They also pack on the cheese and melt it, which is so good!  Last week, I tried their Antipasto Salad. One might think, it's just a salad who cares! Let me tell you, I can't stop thinking about how good the salad was. First of all, there was a ton of fresh sliced lunchmeat that tasted more like deli meats then your run-of-the-mill cold cuts from the supermarket. They were so good! The salad itself had to be the portion equivalent of 2 whole bags of salad mix from the grocery store- it was massive.  It also had a nice selection of black olives, whole peppercinis, cheese, and tomatoes. The ranch dressing tasted homemade and they gave a nice portion size. The salad also came with sliced garlic bread but I didn't partake in that because I cut back on my carbs. It looked and smelled delicious though. It's on par with the prices of salads at other restaurants, with three times the portion size. You may even want to share this with a friend.   Listen. I know this place is a total dive but it's one of those places you just can't deny. The food is homemade and excellent - and not just because Fieri went there. It truly is stick to your ribs & you better believe you are taking home a doggy bag at the end of the meal, while still unbuttoning your pants because you ate too much.",

I got the 1/2lb of corn beef Reuben.  Just like I remembered.  So good, great corn beef, not that deli counter crap. Also got a side of fresh cut fries with beef gravy. She got the open face Roast Beef sandwich w/fries and gravy.  Super tender roast beef. Everything was yummy. Surprisingly a big beer list but I'm  PBR  guy.

She had the white sauce for a change and I had the red.  My daughter had the gnocchi with marinara sauce.  The dishes came with a nice salad with a great Italian dressing which turned out to be the highlight of the meal.  My linguine was over cooked, the clams and accompanying sauce was bland.  My wife's was not much better.  My daughter's gnocchi was the best of the dishes with a good marinara sauce accompanying a large serving.  The meal came with a nice garlic bread basket.    Food - 2-3 Stars - I know that I didn't have there specialties, but I was disappointed with my meal.  I would not return for any of the ones served, knowing there is much better.  Maybe another choice? Atmosphere - 2 Stars If the food was good it would not have mattered, but it is worn. Service - 3 Stars - Average  Price - 3.5 Stars - Large servings but food, heh...

For my meal I had the chicken parm. The plate was the size of my body. Not my head, my body. Delicious. Covered in gooey cheese and piping hot, rich red sauce. Yum. The pasta was less impressive and the reason for the missing star above. Bland bland bland. Just needed to add a little salt to the cooking water and all would have been well. But no matter. I concentrated on the chicken and left stuffed. I would definitely go back to try other offerings. The sandwiches were obscenely large but looked awesome.",

    "text": "Ah yes...Big Jim's. I have been eating here since the early 80s when my Mom worked there. My first memory of video games comes from Big Jim's. I was sitting on someone's lap playing a table top version of Q-Bert. Those were the days.  This place is just a hole in the wall. But its a great one. No matter what you get off the menu, its tasty. This time, we got the open-faced roast beef sandwich, the open-faced turkey sandwich, a small cheese pizza and a chicken parm sandwich.  The two open-faced sandwiches are awesome. Big piles of meat and gravy on top of hearty chunks of Italian bread and thin-cut homemade fries. The turkey was real sliced turkey from a turkey breast. The roast beef is fresh sliced, too.  The pizza is always good. The really pile on the cheese. Unfortunately today, they piled the sauce on, too. There was literally enough sauce to scoop off the pizza and eat with a fork. Which I did, because their sauce is almost as good as my own. Still though...all that sauce is not needed.  The chicken parm was okay. It was a large chicken cutlet but it wasn't very crispy. The bread was good and just like the pizza, the cheese was piled high on this hoagie.  Other than the overly saucy pizza the only real complaint was the waitress wasn't very friendly. This is atypical of the place and this is the first time I can recall having a crabapple for a server here.  I don't like to base my reviews on previous visits, and I won't. But I well touch base on some of the other menu items that are top notch. Their pasta is always good. They really do have a good sauce. I'm not the kind of person who likes ordering pasta in restaurants because its never as good as my own (or my father's). But Big Jim's is the sort of place I can break my rules over.  They have these fried eggplant appetizers. They're awesome. Skip the parmesan version and just get them with marinara on the side.  The salads are always huge. Just make sure you tell them you don't need any french fries on them...Big Jim's, just like many other restaurants in this city, likes to muck up a perfectly good salad by dumping fries all over them. They have a homemade Italian dressing that is truly delicious. We've commented time and time again how we wish we could buy it by the bottle and take it home with us.  All the meat on their sandwiches is the real deal. Actual sliced roast beef and turkey. I don't know where they get their cold cuts from, but they're not cheap....they're quite good. The bread's great, as well. Crispy and flaky on the outside, soft and hearty on the inside.  Like I said...pretty much everything on the menu is good. We've tried a little bit of everything on the menu and you can't go wrong.",

I settled on the Veal Parmesan and couldnt believe my eyes when it came to the table, the veal was bigger than my platter!  I couldnt even finish my meal and ended up taking half of it home, great value for the money.     They also make homemade wedding soup thats outta this world!

Parked in front of the neighbors house and only had to walk across the street which was great.i took a minute for safety as there were a few people out front and I wasn't sure at first glance which door to use to go inside.  Inside to the left is a dinning room that we walked into. The room was soooo Very musty smelling that it was on the border of pull your shirt up to your nose to breath. Before we sat I checked the bar side and it was better. Not good but much better. The waitress was as nice as the tables were sticky. If you walked in this place with nobody around ,you would think it was abandoned for a few months. There is nothing wrong with being a Dive, but some Windex and a towel would go a long way.i could only imagine what there homes look like. Anyway we decided to stay. Good enough for Guy good enough for us. Hot open roast beef,fries, gravy was good. Lots lots of gravy on everything. I wish the beef wasn't sooo very well done but it all tasted like the gravy anyway. I would give it a 7.  My son got the Reuben sandwich. He was not happy. He pulled a big chunk of fat/cartilage / something ,out of his mouth and lost interest after that. He picked at half and was not a fan of the sauerkraut. I tried it and it tasted spoiled. We took the other half to go and left it in our fridge in the hotel when we checked out of the hotel  I said thank you to our waitress and left her a 25% tip because she was nice. If my son chooses this school I would never return .  Just to show its not all bad.we visited  Fuel and Fuddle near the college the next day for lunch. 10 out of 10. Really really good. ( and clean ,and lighted) unlike big jims.",

Pizza was quite good too.  I think everyone was very satisfied, and filled, by their meal.  Prices are very reasonable.  The service was good.  I had read, and heard, that service was either a nightmare or good.  We lucked out as our server was very attentive and happy to split our group into 3 checks.

I ordered an order of the provolone sticks and a half of the chicken parm sandwich (see photo). Now,  I don't know whether it was because I was extremely hungry, but that chicken parm was probably up there with the top 3 chicken parm sandwiches that I've had in my life.

I know it's not fine dining but that was never done. Spaghetti and meat sauce. That was very watery but nicely cooked pasta. Garlic bread was hard as rocks but the watery sauce softened it up.  They need to shut down for a week and paint and clean.  Staff was just OK, not outstanding as has been in the past.  No pride in the work.  This hurts my heart it write this review. But the truth is the truth and it's time to face it.",

    "text": "Big Jim's on the Run. What to say about this place. Well it was on Dinners Drive-ins and Dives and I thought it was just OK. Sure you can order a huge double decker veal parmesan but it was just OK.   The sandwich was served on a half loaf and it was toasted so it was hard as a rock and had to be smashed down causing a plate full of crumbs and crusty bits.   The restaurant is nothing more than a dirty outdated dive bar with sloppy looking employees that don't wear any type of uniform or matching clothing. It's hard to tell who works there and who is just someone trying to get a meal.   I don't mean to be hating but I went there once and haven't really wanted or felt the need to go back. So 3 stars for delivering something good but over all the large portions and TV fame wasn't enough to get me back in the door a second time.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend for dinner.  We decided to come here after randomly seeing it featured on a repeat of Guy Fieri's Diners Drive-Ins And Dives earlier in the week.  The outside is not too much to look at but the inside is comfortable.  Appropriately we were seated right underneath a Guy Fieri poster that proclaimed that the Veal Parmigiana \"as big as yer head\".  As you would expect with food that large it seemed that everyone that was leaving the restaurant had a to-go box.  We knew from the episode that they make their wedding soup from scratch daily and so started off with a cup of that.  It had a good taste to it and had much more chicken flavor than most wedding soups that I have had in the past.  The escarole as a green was also pretty nice.  For my entree I decided on having the Veal Parmigiana sandwich as I wanted to see how big it actually was while my girlfriend decided upon the lasagna.  Both portions were quite large with the sandwich being as large as advertised and I have a picture to prove it!  It actually ended up being so big that I could not possibly fit my mouth around it.  So I ended up taking off the top which essentially made it into two open faced sandwiches.  The bread was crispy while the veal was fried nicely and the sauce and cheese complimented the rest nicely.  My only complaint with it is that it was a bit dry and I think that some more sauce could have been helpful with that.  Even so, the half of the sandwich that I ate tasted good.  My girlfriends lasagna also seemed to be a super sized portion as it filled up her whole plate.  It had a lot of ricotta cheese in it which helped to give it an overall flavor that I enjoyed.  Like almost everyone else that I saw, we ended up leaving with some to-go boxes as I still had half of my sandwich left and my girlfriend half of her lasagna.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  It was a cool little place in which you definitely get a huge portion size for your money and the food is pretty good too!",

    "text": "With so many new semi-pretentious restaurants opening in Pittsburgh, it's nice that we finally discovered Big Jim's, making it \"new\" to us! It took me nearly six years of living in PIttsburgh, but I may have finally found that go-to, no-frills Italian restaurant that suits our laid back attitudes and selective palates.  I've ran, biked, and driven past Big Jims over and over throughout the years, but never even realized it was there. It's so unassuming and dive-y, that it's easy to miss, but stopping in is definitely worth your time.  We've ordered takeout a few times and eaten in a few times already, and it's never really disappointed. The staff has always been really attentive and nice when dining in, and takeout has always satisfied...even when they gave me the wrong hoagie once, it was delicious enough to forgive them.  Their chicken parm hoagies and dinner are both excellent, and the dinner is big enough to eat family-style. Good luck finding food in those portions, with that flavor, for under $11 somewhere else. The housemade Italian dressing is phenomenal, and should seriously be bottled and sold. We've only tried the white pizza so far, but it was delicious. I've had the Italian hoagie and cheese steak hoagie, as well. Both were good...although I used their Italian dressing on the Italian hoagie, which almost isn't fair, since that stuff could make anything amazing.  If you're looking for a place to get a good hoagie, pizza, or simple Italian meal that's so reasonably-priced you feel like you're ripping Big Jim off, this is the place.",

We then saw it on triple D and were intrigued so after finally make plans to go, we just did so tonight.  Despite the dive-y appearance, I have to say there is nothing about Big Jim's that I did not love.    We were promptly greeted by a server, sat in the bar area (where less minors seem to dine so that makes it more enjoyable for adults without children), and were greeted with waters and asked if we had any questions.  So far so good.  On the menu for us tonight was Provolone sticks, wedding soup, Chicken Parm dinner, and Chicken Parm hoagie.  Holy cow was it a ton of food!!!!  The wedding soup was good (no noodles though), the italian dressing on the house salad that came with the Chix parm dinner was AMAZING.  Seriously some of the best dressing I have ever had.  My husband enjoyed the sticks and the hoagie as well.  A++++++!  For $31 and some change (that included an alcoholic beverage as well), you cannot go wrong here.  The chix parm dinner will easily be another meal for one of us as well.  Not the classiest looking of places but if you are the type of person who appreciates good food in a laid back environment, you will love Big Jim's :)",

The cheese was oozing onto the plate, the meatballs were tasty and the meat sauce on it was great. Someone mentioned an odd taste to it - I think it's the pork that's in the meat sauce. My girlfriend got a full chicken parm as well. I gave that a taste and the chicken was almost better than the meatballs! It was excellent. I highly recommend going here.",

Its also not in a very commercial place so finding it might be a little hard. We ordered the wing dings to start. They're breaded fried wings. Came out quick hot so you know its fresh. My fiance ordered the open roast beef sandwich. Its topped with gravy and fries. I tried a little bit and I was really good. I ordered half a meatball hoagie. Even for a half a hoagie it was huge. My sandwich was really good too. Our total bill was $25 and we left full and comatosed. If you're in the area and want a laid back place this is definitely a place to try.

Although the food was always good, the place was getting dirtier every time I was there.  Yesterday my wife and I decided to stop for lunch. I figured that the place was probably cleaned up since the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode. After being seated, I wanted to leave. To be honest, I don't know why I stayed. Nothing had changed. In fact I think it got worse.  The floor was filthy. There was food under tables that looked like it was there for days. Remember, I was here for lunch and they just opened. The tables and chairs in the dining room looked as though they were purchased at a yard sale. Very old and falling apart.  The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the service and food was good. I had an Italian hoagie and my wife had a salad. Both tasted good but I really couldn't enjoy it.  I kept thinking that if the dining room was this dirty, what is the kitchen like?",

Being that I was in the Pittsburgh area, I figured I'd give this hole-in-the-wall a try, especially since Guy Fieri recommended it (although I am starting to doubt his taste because, frankly, all his suggestions have blown thus far).   We get here and it's confusing from the start. The guy from the back (does he cook the food? wash the dishes?) seats us in the dark bar area. He asks us what we want to drink and tells someone to get us Diet Pepsi (we ordered regular Pepsi). We get the menus and I was tempted to get out a flashlight just to read it.   In the meantime, a waitress comes over and asks us what we want to drink. We tell her Pepsi. She walks off. Someone else comes over and puts down two Pepsi glasses. Then she walks over with two more. Looks like there is no communication here - or light fixtures.  Looking at the expansive menu, we decide to check Yelp on our phones for other reviewer's suggestions before ordering. We've done it before and it's worked. Unfortunately, this gets us a rude comment from a guy who is now our server (yep, we have now had three people \"serve\" us). He snaps at us, asking if we're texting or if we're ready. Well, excuse me, Mr. Sassy Pants. I was actually looking for what to order in this dump, if you don't mind. Not wanting to ruin what is supposed to be a fun experience, we politely order our meals. I get the chicken sandwich, he gets the roast beef au jus.  A whole HALF HOUR later, our magical sandwich creations come out from the kitchen. One look at these things, and you'd ask yourself, What the hell took so damn long? My sandwich was the most uninspired thing I've seen in a long time. It was a big slab of chicken breast thrown in between a hamburger bun, with an un-melted slice of American cheese, uncooked green peppers and a spoonful of grilled onions. Half of it tasted like chicken -- the other half tasted burnt and like an old oven. His sandwich was no better - but it came with burnt, hard and cold french fries that a dog would sneer its nose at.   Needless to say, the food was terrible. I don't care about the \"large portions\" and \"everything is made on the premises\" bullsh** - this food is barely edible. Like I said, I get that this place has \"character\" and it's dirty on purpose which adds to its charm but I'm sorry, you aren't winning me over on that load of horse apples. Take your character and shove it where the sun don't shine - which just so happens to be the dark dining room at Big Jim's.",

If you saw this place on TV (and let's face it, that's the only way anybody from outside this secret hideaway neighborhood would find this place) keep your TV romantic notions about it and stay home.  We did have the things they featured on the DDD show and they were (looking for a kind word here) ....awful.  The Italian Wedding Soup (normally a favorite of mine) had mystery meat and an over-abundance of salt. The Veal Parmigana Sandwich looked so obscenely large that we opted for the Veal Parmigana Plate with spaghetti.  They certainly give you quantity over quality here.  The Veal was pounded so thin, and then fried long enough to come out resembling two soles of a lost pair of shoes, and harder to chew.  The pasta was overcooked (but plenty of it!) with a bland tomato sauce that seemed canned (I know, the TV shows them making it from scratch).  They packed the place for the TV show, but you'll have no trouble getting a table.  We sat by the bar, so there was an abundance of TV and butt-crack visible from our table.  The pizza my partner had is about the only passable thing there was to eat here.  This place is so far out of the way, and so hard to find that our GPS threw a tantrum.  It was a huge disappointment, and I blame Fieri for that.",

We split chicken parm and still took half of it home.  The chicken was very tender and seasoned well, the homemade sauce was perfect.  I couldn't say enough about this place...it's a new favorite!",

    "text": "One of my favorite things I've ever heard Guy Fieri say is \"If you're from Pittsburgh, you've heard of 'The Run'\". Guy, I had not heard of the run, and I have yet to meet anyone that, prior to going to Big Jim's, has heard of The Run either(Except for my one friend's grandma). However, I'll not forget The Run - a small stretch in Greenfield near the South Side Works involving a baseball field that has housed this place since 1977 - after having come to Big Jim's.  Big Jim's is full of cheap,largely-portioned food that I think is characteristic of this area. Little flair, decent flavor, no funny business. Enter and take your pick of the dining room or the bar area. There may be a wait(I've been here once or twice with a line out the door, mostly during games. Go another time and you're good to sit just about anywhere). The crowd is a good mix - neighbors, locals, Pitt students. The menu is a selection of mostly fried appetizers, sandwiches, hoagies, some Italian specialties, and pizza.   My favorite item to get here is definitely the veggie hoagie. So simple: Good bread, provalone cheese, brocolli, cauliflower, onions, peppers, carrots, thrown in the oven until the veggies are roasted(Add mayo for me, of course... And sometimes a little ketchup :). This thing tastes amazing, and while I could probably down a full one, I prefer to share it with a side of some kind of appetizer. The spaghetti here is also pretty good, and I've had the eggplant parmesian and it was decent. The entrees will net you garlic bread and spaghetti and a salad, large portions of everything, so don't attempt them alone.  Now all that being said, I do have a few gripes about this place - Number one being that the service is slow. My order usually takes about 20-30 minutes to come back to me, which for a hoagie is kind of crazy in my opinion. The staff is friendly and it's hard to get upset, just don't come here for a 'quick' bite. My other gripe is that while some of the menu is definitely home cookin', other parts of the menu are definitely not, so buyer beware. My girlfriend ordered the applesauce once($1.50) and about 15 minutes later(but well before the rest of our food came) the waitress handed her a generic plastic cup of applesauce, not even opened. I mean come on, at least put the stuff in a dish.  But what are you gonna do. The veggie hoagie is too good to pass up. Just accept the stuff for what it is, and don't try and go on the edge of this place's comfort zone. Stick to what they do best and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I have no doubt that this place is a good restaurant with loyal regulars, however my experience was odd to say the least. I took my girlfriend and friend there for their birthdays and we decided to sit at the bar because we wanted to sit on the bar side and there were no tables to sit 3 people. We were told we could not sit at the bar because my girlfriend is only 20, although my friend and I are both 21, understandable. They put 2 tables together and had us sit there. The odd part begins when the server comes over saying that my girlfriend has to sit and the segment of the table farthest away from both mine and my friends drinks. (Basically she couldn't sit across from either of us because of the temptation the alcohol would have imposed on her?) Think that's weird? It gets better. 60 seconds later the server comes back over saying that his boss wants the tables separated a little, so he proceeds to pull them apart 6 inches. Furthermore I am not deaf, if you are going to talk about a table do it behind closed doors. The manager thought I was an informant for a liquor control agency. We laughed because I apparently look like a nark. With that being said I place no blame on the servers because they were just doing what they were told but to the manger I ask, what other restaurant do you know of that does not let an underage person sit with an of age person. That's just silly. We all thought the food was okay but, Big Jim's, was a big experience-- and deserving of my first ever Yelp review.",
