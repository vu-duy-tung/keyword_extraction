I've tried food from all four of the kitchens, and can honestly say I'd go back to any of them. Some favorites have been the roasted beets at Provision, the octopus at Carota, the corned beef sandwich from Aubergine and of course the avocado toast from Josephine's. The menus seem to frequently change or have specials, and that's one of the great things about this place. I plan to keep going back and won't get tired of the options!   While all of the food choices are good, the bar might even be better. They have a changing menu of local beers on tap and the cocktails are delicious. And if you get there for happy hour pricing you can't ask for much more! There's also an espresso bar area if you aren't in the mood for alcoholic beverages.   The only negative I have is that when the bar area gets crowded it's not the most convenient for this type of setup where you have to order your own drinks every time and there are not servers, but overall the pros of SG outweigh the cons by a lot. Check it out if you get the chance!",

They will talk with you if they have time about their style and food, which add a lot to the experience.  The dishes are not all home runs, but that is why the test kitchen exists, to allow the chefs to get feedback and try out some of their ideas before they open up an independent restaurant.  The bar and coffee baristas are great as well.   The one big critique that I have is the lay out.  The restaurant feels crowded all the time because of the use of space.  They tried to put large tables in a place that is not necessarily made for them, creating a cramped environment.  So when the Galley does get busy, then there is little room to move.    Overall, I love this concept and the food here at this restaurant.  My hats off to the chefs that are starting out here.  I hope that Pittsburgh is able to open more places like this that will attract young chefs to the growing food scene.",

But when you taste the food you completely forget about all of that because it's amazing. First we tried Carota Cafe.... we had the herbed baked eggs and the house ricotta w blueberry chia jam, both served with their house made whole grain sourdough toast. Wow! Both were so great, the ricotta was super fresh and creamy, and the herbed eggs were perfectly accompanied with roasted root vegetables in a cast iron skillet. Next, we tried the homemade pasta and grilled shrimp from Aubergine Bistro. Served in a parsnip butter with parsnips and shiitake mushrooms, it was so fresh and flavorful. Ended with Millie's Almond Butter ice cream, which was BANGIN! Can't wait to go back and try the other 2 restaurants. Hopefully this sweet joint gets more streamlined.",

I will definitely return and recommend Smallman Galley to friends.  There are many interesting menu items I want to try.  Service was a little awkward, but other guests helped us figure out how it worked.  It's basically a food court, so I was surprised when the POS system prompted a tip.  I added a 20% tip out of habit but was not sure why or who it was going to.  There is no service except order taking.  I hope my tip found its way to the wonderful, efficient, friendly busser.  Next time we will save our tip and give it directly to the busser.",

There was sausage, an amazing gravy, herbs, crisp potatoes on top with \"dippy\" eggs (using my new found PA terminology).   I'm already looking forward to waking up tomorrow so I can eat my mound of leftovers. That's how excited that pizza gets me.   As far as aesthetic, Small Man Galley is industrial modern, with a touch of minimalist. Also can we talk about how hella cute their drink menus are (they are VHS tape holders, branded).

This evening we tried Iron Born   Chef Pete's pizza concept should take every single Pittsburgher out of their stereo typical local pizza joint habits into an amazingly delightful crispy, airy heaven.   The white pizza was absolutely fantastic.  Garlic Cream - Caramelized Onions, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula, Whipped Ricotta were so perfectly matched with this unbelievable crust.   The garlic chili wings are large and packed the perfect amount of heat.   We had the unique opportunity to sit at the high top counter facing the other restaurants.  Directly next to one of the cooks from another restaurant in the Galley.  His excitement talking about his chef at BRUNOISE made us excited to return and try Chef Ryan's creations.   We enjoyed our meal, chatting with the cooks and people watching. The bar sever fantastic beer selections in addition to drink choices that compliment the menus of the restaurants.   I highly recommend a visit to Smallman Galley.  They are open early on the weekends and I hear they each have an amazing brunch menu.",

    "text": "I've tried to write a review for Smallman Galley at least three other times, but always have to stop because I feel like my view of this place is so different than most of the other reviews I see. I've been there at least five different occasions, and have tried a multitude of their brunch, dinner, and dessert options. I honestly wasn't truly impressed by anything I had there, except for dessert and the occasional dinner entree. I really want to like this cool concept with nice staff and pretty decor, but I have never been that happy at the end of a meal there.  I've sampled food from the restaurants that were there before, as well as the new ones. I've paid up to $12 for avocado toast and although it was delicious, it can be a little unsatisfactory to pay so much for a baguette and a small side salad. I tried the toast at \"toast\" previously and enjoyed their options more and spent less money. I should have tried the berries, cream, and crumble this weekend, but instead chose the avocado baguette. I regretted it almost immediately after ordering. In the past I've had different egg dishes, sandwiches, butterscotch pudding, and lukewarm shrimp and grits. This time I tried a Brazilian breakfast sandwich, pancakes (delicious), baguette with avocado, and the side of beans in my boyfriends steak and eggs entree (which he loved).   So my friends food was pretty good and my boyfriend liked his meal a lot, but I was not on the same page...again. After this visit, I also told my boyfriend that I am only going back to Smallman Galley to try out their new dinner options and if I'm still not enthusiastic about the food, then I won't be back again... until maybe they change out their restaurant again because for whatever reason I want to like this place SO BAD....",

    "text": "Smallman Galley opened after I moved from the burgh, and I have been itching to come back here since I heard about the concept, which is perfect for a group of people who have a lot of palettes to please. My mom and I came here for lunch on a rainy Wednesday after we finished shopping in the Strip. It was around 12:30pm and was not very crowded save for a few groups of workers from nearby businesses. I was also excited my mom agreed to step out of her comfort zone and try something different so I could experience SG!   As others have noted, the concept is reminiscent of a food hall and offers four different \"restaurants\" to eat at. For each one, you order at the counter, take a number, and your food is brought out when ready. I appreciated the large amount of dining space available; seems great for groups. I also liked the water on each table already available for use. There is a bar, but I can't comment on that aspect of SG.   My mom and I both chose to eat at Provision Pittsburgh, however, the setup and ordering process is quite conducive to each person ordering from a different concept. Since all the current concepts have been described, I'm not going to rehash them. The cashier at Provision filled us in on the fact that this was their (and all others) last week, and the new concepts will begin next week.   My mom ordered \"the burger\"-Beef Pattie | Simple Greens | Parmesan Frica | Umami Aioli | Smoked Mushrooms | Cheddar | Challah  and chose the fries over the simple salad. The Umami aioli was similar to chipotle mayo and was a great dipper for the fries. The fries were delicious when they were hot, which they were upon the dish's arrival. The salt and herb mixture sprinkled on the fries was flavorful and these were clearly fresh cut, crispy, and triple fried-YUM! My mom thought it was juicy, and cooked perfectly to her requested medium temp. I ordered the banh mi-Sweet & Sour Pork | Pickled Onion & Carrot | Cilantro | Mint | Smoked Peanut Aioli | Baguette with a simple salad as my side. The portion of the salad was generous and the light vinaigrette was tasty, perhaps a lemon vinaigrette. I was more focused on the banh mi, which was delicious! First, the portion was extremely generous and filling. The baguette was crispy and fresh, and the pork was crispy with a distinctive sweet and sour coating. I loved the smoked peanut aioli which was, obviously, smoky, and added a sweeter flavor to the dish. The pickled onions and carrots was on point and the addition of jalapenos added that little kick. I appreciated the mint which mitigated some of the heavy cilantro flavor. All of the flavors weaved together wonderfully in a nice, succinct platter.   I definitely cannot wait to see what the new concepts at Smallman Galley will be, and hopefully I can return to try one of them during my next trip to the Burgh!",

I went with multiple friends for a dinner and we all figured getting some bowls would be the right call. The food was bland and just tasted like it didn't go together: one example being that they BOILED the plantains and mixed in with white rice. The food was not well seasoned and was incredibly overpriced for the amount of food I got.   My closing note is that this restaurant just tastes like cultural appropriation. This highlight of the evening was My friends and I bonding over how bad it was: so its great for that!",

I have been to the Smallman Galley on a couple of different occasions now and have been able to try all four of the cafes and I am impressed! All of them are amazing, so amazing and unique that I wouldn't be able to pick a favorite! I first came here on their pre-opening night for a yelp event and even though I have been traveling a lot and seen a lot, I haven't come across a concept like this.   The atmosphere is unique as well. Kind of industrial, laid back, but always buzzing with people. I love the long tables in the back where it was always fun to meet your neighbors. It's just like having a huge family get together, where most of the times you don't know all your relatives and have to introduce yourself :)  I have had the grilled octopus from Carota Cafe and OMG! Amazing and perfectly grilled. It's so easy to screw up octopus, but this one was tender, full of flavor and the crispy potatoes, the olives and chimichurri perfectly accompanied it. You want meatballs? Try Aubergines lamb and pork meatballs! Who can really say no to Provision fries? And have you tried the blackberry apple toast cake from Josephine's Toast? Divine!   I haven't tried brunch here yet, but I have had lunch/dinner/happy hour cocktails/coffee and dessert. All of their food is amazing, and once you have ordered you don't actually have to wait and stand around and miss all the fun as they will happily send you a text once the dish is ready at the counter. Their happy hour is quite popular so make sure you get there early!   Can't wait to visit again!",

(Other favorite spot was Umami)  I wish that more cities had something like this to get local restauranteurs up and running; I am actually really surprised that Seattle doesn't have something similar! And if they do, you should reply here on my post so I can go there and eat immediately!  I was with a large group of people and since the space is so big, there was plenty of room for all of us. We got there fairly early in the day, so the food was just getting up and running and we had a few cocktails while we waited. The Smallman Galley Bar puts their drink menus in old VHS cassette cases- is that genius or what? I love when people recycle stuff like that- makes it a little more memorable. What was not memorable was the cocktail that I had because I had already been drinking. I just remember that it was good as hell and every one of my friend's drinks that I had was good also. The food from the restaurants is a little pricey, but I tried some of the steak tartare from Brunoise and I could have eaten an entire platter of it if the opportunity existed.  Great location, great concept, and delicious food/drink. Definitely need to try this place if you haven't!",

    "text": "I finally got an opportunity to check out Smallman Galley last night after much anticipation! I had some pretty high expectations due to all the praises I had heard, and this place managed to meet every single one of them. I am officially obsessed.  Smallman Galley completely embodies everything that I love in a bar/restaurant. The atmosphere is outstanding. It's separated into a couple different rooms which provide varying experiences. For example, one room has long family style tables and seems a little more quiet and intimate, while another room includes a long bar and has more of a party feel. The brick walls, wooden shelving, and exposed light bulbs add to the overall hip vibe. With such an enjoyable ambiance, I could see myself spending plenty of time here.  I'm always on the hunt for a great happy hour, and Smallman Galley takes the cake. Every single libation on their menu is half off during happy hour, including full bottles of wine! Need I say more? My friends and I arrived around 6:45 PM on a Tuesday - just in time to sneak in a happy hour drink. I chose the Stargell's Stars cocktail, which includes two different variations of Maggie's Farm rum and some fruit juices. I think this is one of my favorite cocktails that I've ever had, and I'm not exaggerating. Yum! It came handsomely presented in a gimlet glass with a piece of starfruit on top. I would also like to mention that our bartender was fantastic. In spite of how busy she was, she was talkative with us and made our experience a positive one.  I'm going to have to come back to Smallman Galley soon, because there are so many food options that I'm dying to try! I love the restaurant incubator idea - the only issue with it is that it's so hard to choose! We shared the cheese and toast plate from Josephine's Toast which was delicious. We especially loved the sauces that were included. I also tasted the Provision fries as well as the kielbasa. I have nothing bad to say about any dish I tasted. The menu at each establishment is innovative and unlike anything I've seen before. You won't just enjoy the food here - it'll knock your socks off.  In conclusion: it's worth the hype, people.",

    "text": "I'm going to agree with the consensus that this place has an awesome concept. Was it executed well? Meh, not really. I say this because the method of ordering and seating is similar to a food court in the mall. You pick what you want and you find yourself a seat. Because seating at such a hip joint is first come first serve, it becomes pretty cutthroat to find a space for you and your party. You'll find yourself having to save a spot while others go order or vice versa. At least at the mall, there's plenty of seating so you can decide where to sit after you have your food.   In terms of food, the menu and selections will change out so what I say about the food now won't matter in the years to come. However, my thoughts on the food will be towards the Provision restaurant and I can't say I was entirely impressed. I ordered the Banh Mi made with crispy chicken skins and the hubby ordered the burger. Although I give the chef credit for creativity, I think the crispy chicken skins gave the banh mi too crispy of a texture. It lacked a substantial protein to balance the already crispy texture of the baguette. The burger wasn't anything to stand out amongst it's competition in the city. My least favorite part of my meal was the fries and maybe it's because of personal preference, but my fries were fried so crispy that they tasted like those refried last bits that have sat at the bottom of the fryer all day. You know what I'm talking about?   Anyway, the concept is great. I wouldn't completely cross this off my list as I know menus will rotate every so often. Looking forward to what they bring in next.",

Unfortunately when I went to Smallman I wasn't super hungry, so all I had was a salad (and my SO got a beer). The salad was a little bit salty and quite small, also overpriced (maybe a function of the location).

Smallman Galley is a restaurant incubator (kind of) for new restaurants! 4 restaurants are in this place for a year and use the time to build a client base. Then, after their time at Smallman Galley, they can launch their own restaurant. Really cool concept!   It's kind of like Shark Tank.   Well, not really.   First, you can sit anywhere where there is an open seat.   Second, go to a restaurant (or multiple) and order.   Third, they will give you a placard to place on your table, and they will magically bring it to you!  Fourth, also magically, people will be walking around to give you water and stuff.   Magical.   *Take note, you have to grab your own plates and utensils from one of the couple stations around the room.   Fifth, eat and enjoy! Eat and enjoy in a very smartly and cool-ly designed space, which is great for large groups or even that hot date you hope might lead to the family you know you are scared to begin yet long to have.   Want a cool dining experience in a great space supporting what I will gladly call a great cause? Look no further...  Smallman is the bigman on campus!!

All stores (except the bar) share the same sitting area, so it certainly has college / food court type of feel.  We had a burger with the one furthest inside (enter from 21st St). The burger is certainly 5 stars. It has mushrooms and the sauce was special. One of the best I had in the Burgh.   We had an octopus salad too (second last store from 21st St?!).  It was \"special-but-ok\" / \"alright, that's interesting\". Not saying it is bad, not at all, more like \"Mmm... O.K.\".  The portion was definitely on the small scale.    Will be back for the burger, but not sure about the octopus salad.  Did not try the other two places yet, but the seared scallops from 2nd store in looks delicious.",

For whatever reason, I never made it back despite how awesome the event/food/owners were.   My friends wanted to do brunch and noticed a delicious chicken and waffle picture on IG. They suggested Smallman Galley and i wasnt about to say no.   Unfortunately, Aubergine's Chicken and Waffles were a limited time deal. They were sold out whenever we arrived at 2:15. (Brunch is only until 3pm Sundays).   We all decided to order from Josephine's Toast. I went with the Smashed Avocado Toast  ($6) and added an egg ($2). I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes ($5) and a flower petal tea. I loved my toast. Im a huge fan of avocado and this was the perfect brunch for me. You are able to order the egg however.. i went with over easy.  My friends ordered a mix of things and we all sampled each other's dishes. I believe one of my friends ordered the build your own toast option with bacon butter & rasberry preservatives. She also ordered their local yogurt with fresh granola and berries (loved!). Another friend ordered the Roasted Pineapple & Cottage Cheese Toast which was amazing and refreshing.   Everything that I sampled here (Josephine's Toast) tasted so fresh (probably the most fresh food ive had while eating out) and delicious. I'm excited to head back to Smallman Galley and sample other chef's items, maybe even for dinner next time.   I love this idea and what Smallman Galley is doing. Go support these chefs. It's cool to be apart of this.",

The concept is fantastic.  2. The location is fantastic. 3. The actual space was so loud that we couldn't hear each other speak.  4. It's not good for dates. The idea that you have to find and save a table means you can't order food with you company. You have to take turns... 5. Cell service wasn't great inside so the text that my food was ready didn't come through. 6. We had the Provisions burger and it didn't have anything significant that stood out other than the amazing description on the board 7. My friends had 2 other dishes that weren't so great  I'm sad to say that I wasn't down.",

I'm giving this place 3 stars primarily I did not enjoy the ambiance or layout, the food was good and I would eat there again if it were not for the layout of this place.  I was not a fan of how congested this place was.  I'm all for businesses making as much money as they can and I fully support putting as many table settings as you can, to create a strong flowing revenue however not when it comes to sacrificing peoples personal space and the comfortable intimacy you look for when going out to eat.  I look for an experience, the last thing I want is to feel anxiety and that's what I got from this place.",

    "text": "Visited a friend in Pittsburgh this past weekend, and we were looking for lunch between house hunting and going to the Mattress Factory. After browsing Yelp a bit, we decided to just browse the Strip.  It was cold, windy and rainy, and we saw a spot in front of Smallman. Initially, I wasn't jazzed about the idea of a cafeteria-style lunch. But the menus looked good, and we discovered there was a full bar in the back.  Upon closer inspection and checking out what other people ordered, the four restaurants had a great variety of price ranges and dishes. My friend ordered the avocado toast with an egg from Josephine's Toast. I ordered the pasta with peas, pesto and parm. Both ended up being flavorful and well-seasoned, and I loved that the pasta was homemade and was showered with lots of microplaned parm. We grabbed seats at the bar to wait for the text (a pretty cool idea) saying our food was ready.  One thing I didn't love was the difference in timing of our dishes. She got her avo toast about 15 minutes before my pasta, so we ended up eating at different times. I'd recommend ordering an appetizer to share first, so one of you isn't staring longingly at the other's meal.  We ordered cocktails--their theme right now is baseball, and the list is called the \"Starting Lineup.\" She had a gin drink with egg white that was well-balanced and garnished beautifully, and I has a rum cocktail with passion fruit.  The second drinks we got, however, stole the show. I ordered the Raise the Jolly Lager, with cracker jack rum, salted lime cordial, lager, and probably something else in it, garnished with a pirate flag. When we ordered that drink, one of the bartenders said, \"Fuck yeah!\" Apparently most people overlook it, but they love making it. (And apparently, this order gave us some street cred, because they gave us samples of Bols Genever and the cracker jack rum.) Can't say enough about how delicious this cocktail was! I'd like five more, please. We'd seen one of the bartenders with luxardo cherries, and my friend asked for a drink with one. She explained she liked St. Germaine, etc., and he came up with a drink that had lemon juice, Bols Genever, St. Germaine, orange bitters and a luxardo cherry. Killer.  We'd planned to go to the Mattress Factory and the Warhol Museum that afternoon. After one cocktail, friend asked if it was OK if we just went to one. After two, we decided to scrap the whole plan--this place was that good. This would do really well in Baltimore--please open one here! Or at least send cracker jack rum.",

Today there were a bunch of Michigan fans watching the football game.  No beef with Michigan.  Great school and in my experience, good people.  I just think the sports bar atmosphere is such a buzz kill and inconsistent with the general awesome vibe of the place.  Understand that one of the owners is a Michigan grad and this is why this goes on.  Here's my appeal to have the Maize and Blue fans go to a sports bar instead of Smallman Galley.",

So went on cursing and threatening me! Never would I expect this at such a nice place of business. I would return 100% for the food but I will never return due to the rudeness of the staff. And on another note me and my girlfriend where sitting next to the kitchen and all I could hear is nothing but F words and N words coming from the majority of the African American staff!

I've been to Smallman a number of times for breakfast, dinner,  or just drinks and Smallman always has something to offer.

    "text": "As we increasingly become a culture of startups, it makes sense that the culinary world should be no exception. To this end, Smallman Galley is Pittsburgh's very first chef/restaurant incubator. What a great concept!  I definitely share other reviewers' enthusiasm for it.  They've got some really nice cocktails and a very solid (rotating) selection of beers on tap. This place is KILLER for happy hours!  Half off all cocktails, beer, and wine. Yes please!  I love the space as well, although it did get a bit crowded near the bar (where the space is kind of narrow). It's got that rustic chic look, with reclaimed wood and exposed brick walls, that many newer Pittsburgh bars and restaurants are picking up.  Food wise, my partner and I tried the banh mi and the burger from Provision.  The burger was solid, cooked well, but pretty basic. It wasn't anything to write home about. The banh mi had nice flavors, but I was not into the chicken skin concept. I wanted to give it a try, because I actually really enjoy crispy, well-seasoned chicken skin (you know, with my chicken meat). The chicken skin that was on this banh mi was too crunchy and soaked with oil ... it tasted like it had been re-fried with oil. The oil flavor was just too intense, and in my opinion there was simply too much of the skin. I feel like regular shredded chicken or pork would have been great with the rest of the flavors of the banh mi.  I'm not weighting the specific experience we had with Provision too heavily towards this rating, though, since it's only one of the four restaurants being incubated, and the selection of restaurants will rotate.  I look forward to returning to Smallman Galley to try some of the other food. Probably during happy hour!",

The bar service is generally good and although they could stand for some better Happy Hour specials, I do enjoy drinking there.    Minus one star for comfort.  I prefer the bar in front of the food vendors for convenience and atmosphere, but having all of those ovens there can make it hard to control the temperature around the bar.

    "text": "Standing ovation for Smallman Galley. What a genius concept! Basically, it's a giant food hall with a big, awesome bar, and a long counter separated into four start-up restaurants.   We arrived on a Friday afternoon, and decided to get drinks first, seats second, food third. The bar was packed already but my husband still obtained our drinks in record time. He came back over to me with a fistful of cash and said the drinks were half-price for happy hour. Steal!   We grabbed seats in the sunny, large space in the back. The tables are picnic-style so you pretty much sit with others which gives the place a really nice community vibe. We had already decided to hit Iron Born for Detroit-style pizza. I made my purchase and took my number back to our seats. A short wait later, we received our pizzas and salad. The pizzas have six large slices and we were happy to have leftovers later that night back in our hotel room. My only regret is that we ordered two styles that were really similar (the red pie and the spicy pie). If I could go back and do it again I'd do one red one white. In any case, the pizzas were both incredible. The salad... meh.   I wish we would have had more time to visit Smallman Galley a second time during our short visit. Pittsburgh is filled with gems. This is one I would not miss!",

I like the concept of this place - basically it's an \"incubator\" for restaurants. While it was interesting to see multiple kitchens in one space, operating as different restaurants, as a college student who was trying to eat filling meals at a reasonable cost...I didn't feel like Smallman Galley was a place that I could regularly visit. The novelty of it or the type of food provided also wasn't as exciting to me to warrant spending the amount of money that I did.   With all that said, the food was still tasty...just not my style.",

I've been to a food hall or two in my day, but this place is cooler. Emerging restauranteurs get to test out their recipes and restaurant concepts with eager crowds who want to try new things. There are also bars and a coffee station, because brunch!   The current restaurant-ettes are: -Colonia (Latin American food) -Brunoise (progressive American cuisine) -Iron Born (pizza). I tried a bite of the brunch pie (Sausage - Shaved Fingerling Potato - Cheddar Cheese - Maple Drizzle) and immediately declared this the winner of brunch. Not just this brunch, but all brunches everywhere. -Bahnmilicious (Vietnamese food). This is the place I ordered my brunch dish from. I had the Jasmine rice and Chinese sausage (fried egg, cucumber, picked vegetables, and sweet sauce.) The whole thing was SO good, but the deliciously sweet sausage was hands down the star. The fresh veggies and rice in (what tasted to me like a fish sauce) were great as well. I also had an iced vietnamese coffee, which was good but perhaps a little too sweet, even for a drink that's supposed to be sweet.",

    "text": "We like Smallman Galley so we were excited to see they were featuring brunch through the weekends in September from 10-3. Who doesn't love brunch? We arrived this past Sunday at 12:45 and sat at the bar to grab cranberry mimosas.  **Let me preface this with this review is based solely on Joey's and not the bar, bartenders or other vendors. They are four stars since we've experienced all in the past few months. (This includes: Home, Iron Born, Bahn Mi and the bar.)  We decided we wanted a breakfast sandwich, a side of bacon and a side of potatoes as well as salmon eggs Benedict and donuts. We had another drink and were waiting and waiting. My BF politely went and asked the woman at Joey's register when we could expect our food since it had been a good 30 mins and it was NOT crowded at all. She said, \"we're plating your food.\" We proceed to have to wait an additional 6-7 minutes for them to plate our food, which didn't include complex items. The woman at the register brought the food out in two trips. When she finished delivering our food, my BF politely said, \"a friendly suggestion for your business would be to improve your customer service.\" She didn't say a word, rolled her eyes and made a shitty grin and walked away. A few minutes later, the chef for Joey's comes over and hands my BF a $50. (We paid $53 plus tip which is a very pricey brunch.) He proceeds to say, \"You have to understand that we are very busy and your order was last.\" We both acknowledged that we understood that, but taking almost 10 minutes to plate food after waiting almost 30 minutes for our brunch and not speak when we politely made a suggestion to the woman was just unprofessional and rude. The chef then proceeds to give my BF the $50 bill and says, \"thank you, I hope you enjoy your $50\" and he walked away. WOW. We were floored! We didn't insinuate wanting money back, just more an apology of why it was taking so long for the food and plating. I will not give any additional business to Joey's due the unprofessional and rudeness of both individuals and the awkward situation we were put in. We will return but support the other 3 businesses and bar.",

It was a bit overwhelming at first to decide if I wanted pizza, Latin American, Vietnamese, or American food. My friend and I ended up going with iron born. Their pizzas looked amazing. We got the fungi pizza and garlic chill wings to split. It was quite busy on Friday night, but there was still room.   Wow, the pizza was phenomenal. The dough was amazing, dense, but not too heavy. The mushrooms, herbs, cheese, and demi glaze were a delightful combination. It was a nice change from the typical pizza here in Pittsburgh. The wings were also good, but could have used some more flavor. I was expecting more of a kick from the garlic chilli sauce. Overall, a great concept to bring people back as I would like to try the other restaurants.",

    "text": "TLDR: great establishment, highly recommend the chicken curry on the chefs menu- authentic flavor and perfect taste!   Banhmilicious is a great fusion Vietnamese food establishment. I ordered the chef's special chicken curry (basically a Thai Red curry) and it tasted highly authentic with all the right herbs and spices. It wasn't too spicy, and had just the right amount of sweetness from the squash. It was the type of flavor combination that even though the spice hurts, you keep wanting more. The chicken was also tender and juicy, complementing the curry sauce very nicely. One personal preference I very much enjoyed was use of the short grain white rice as opposed to long grain.  However, my friend ordered the meatball noodle soup, and the flavor although unique was questionable at best. There was too much allspice in the broth which led to some conflicting flavor profiles.  The ambiance and environment is very modern hipster/ deconstructed. Along with the service, this place ranks high amongst dining options in Pittsburgh.",

This was my first time here and I came for Sunday Brunch. I take brunch very seriously and it's even more important to me on Sunday because it sets the tone for my week. I decided to try the Latin American food from Jesse Barlass' Colonia. I chose the Brazillian which included beans, two fried eggs, and Medium flank steak with chimichurri. I was also able to grab an iced coffee from The Commonplace Coffeehouse next to the bar.   My meal was fantastic! The flavors complimented each other: the steak was done perfectly and the beans were amazing. I'm hoping I get an opportunity to try some other things on Colonia's menu. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, as well. I'm usually not a huge fan the mess hall or cafeteria seating, but it truly works here.",

The only dish we were not impressed with was the salad. Too heavy in the mixed greens and kale, no lettuce really.  My fav was the short ribs then the red side of the pizza. My son loved the salmon poke as did my husband and they both liked the white side of the pizza. The food was terrific. I know, you are waiting for the but... Well, here it is. It was really expensive. It is cafeteria style. We get our own utensils and napkins, the seating is long tables where multiple parties can sit. (There are smaller tables too.) And for the four items and 2 drinks it was $80. We tipped at every stall, but really not certain why so much. We got numbers, sat down and they brought out our food. We did the rest. Don't get me wrong, it would be a great night out with friends etc. But for our family, I was hoping for a lower price point. We will probably go back, but for date night, instead of a quick bite.",

But sometimes things happen for a reason, and this time it was a good reason!  I think the concept of Smallman is really interesting and unique to Pittsburgh.    When I walked in I wasn't sure what was going on.  There was not an evident area for the hostess or to wait for seating.  Well, this is due to the fact that you choose to sit wherever you'd like!  And it is group seating, so you might be at a table with other diners, or you could pick one of the few two tops that are available.  There is plenty of room and I think this is a cool concept.  After you find your seat you have a couple choices for food.  There are several different 'restaurants' inside.  I chose Iron Born Pizza.  It's \"Detroit Style\" which apparently means very thick crust and square shaped.  It was delicious.  I HAD to get it because several other people were eating it and it looked amazing.  I had the mushroom and cheese and it was hard to not eat all six (square) slices!    I was there during happy hour so drinks were all half off.  Six bucks for a decent glass of wine - yes please!    For a Thursday evening after work this place was packed.  I look forward to coming back and trying one of the other food options.

    "text": "So, I like the concept of smallman galley. It is like a long term public market setup, where the chefs stay for a set period of time. There are 4 restaurants, a coffee shop, and a bar within the galley. I have tried food from all of the chefs and it is all amazing.   Of note: Brunch at Josephine's toast- so basically add an egg to any of the toasts and they are AMAZING! I like the avocado smashed toast with fried egg on top.  Provision smothered fries-OMG yes! These are the kind of fries that I would call frites, and they are sooo good. Such a weird mix of flavors (squash, lentils, goat cheese), but it completely works. MMMMMMMmmmmmm.  Another thing to keep in mind, you can have private events here! I looked really hard into having my wedding reception here. It was just a little too small for my event, but it would be amazing for something else.",

Menus hard to read on wall above each food station, so have to walk around and figure out what you want. Descriptions weren't complete. My cousin ordered cheese bread which ended up being three small rolls with a sweet sauce similar to dulce de leche, not at all what she expected. I ordered the Mojo Pork sandwich which came with a side of potato salad. The potato salad was seasoned well and had a great flavor, it did have to much sauce though. The sandwich bread was excellent crisp and chewy. The ingredients were bland. The pork tasted like there was no salt and watery/mushy. If I go back, I will be skippy this station in the Galley.",

We met my BF's son and GF here for a late brunch on Sunday and while the place was packed, the food was delivered promptly and was simply delicious. I had a Bloody Mary which was the perfect blend of tangy tomato chased by the right amount of horseradish zest. A bit pricey for $9 for well vodka but it was still one of the best I have had.  I ordered Paedo Que Jo (can't spell it or pronounce it) but it was damn good.  A very different twist on a traditional breakfast sandwich.  My BF has a Brazilian something or other with eggs and chorizo and it was delicious as well.  I would definitely go here again, most likely when I'm not trying to diet (!) but it was well worth the cheat.",

Walk around and peruse their menus and see what you are interested in.  Place your order at the counter, each restaurant has their own, take a seat in the spacious seating areas, wait for a text message that your food is ready and then eat.  Pretty simple set-up, but can be confusing for 1st timers (I was one of them).  In addition to the four restaurant options, they do have a full service bar and a small coffee bar, all located with the 'galley'.  This is a unique and great place for brunch. Great food in a laid back and casual environment. Absolutely affordable. Give it a shot of you want to avoid the lines at the other brunch hot spots in the strip.",

If you find yourself I the strip, you have to stop in and see what they are doing in here. Today there were four food stations to choose from, all very cool and ranged from breakfast/ brunch items to burgers and a Thai station. So you check out the different chefs offerings, place your order, grab a seat in the open area or near the bar, and they txt you when your food is ready! Serious cool vibe in here! We tried Josephine's toast since it was around brunch time, I had the roasted pineapple and cottage cheese toast and my wife had the smashed avacado with flax seed toast! Brilliant idea, just enough for a mid day snack The bar had over 20 different drafts to choose from plus wine and mixed drinks. This is a concept that I could see becoming a regular thing.",

CHOO CHOOOOO  First off, there are so many lures to bring you into this place: the creative concept, the chill ambiance, the half-off happy hour drinks... all good reasons.  Oh, and the food is pretty damn good too.   From Provision, we got the burger and liver pate, and from Aubergine, the meatballs and smashed potatoes. Presentation was on point, portions and price were reasonable, and flavor was KILLER.   In addition to the above, I really liked these things too: - It's FAST! We were on a tighter schedule, and you can easily get in and out in less than an hour without shoveling down your food. It took literally 12 minutes, and I know that because... - They text you when your food is ready to pick up. What a smart idea.  - Friendly bar staff! - Abundant seating, with varying arrangements. When we went, the bar was pretty hopping for happy hour, but you could also have enjoyed a quieter meal on the restaurant side.  So overall, not only a great idea, but it's also executed really well. Definitely hitting Smallman up again at some point.",

On Fridays, the bar is slammed at happy hour, but any other weekdays is a stellar time to enjoy very nicely priced cocktails, wine, and beer/cider (yes, they do have cider)! Since they don't have table service, you can get HH prices even when sitting outside the bar (you just need to go put in the drink order yourself), which opens up a lot of options. This is an incredible place to go with picky friends, because there are many choices of cuisine, let alone entree, but an even better place to go with adventurous friends and then just eat family style.  I've gone 4-5 times over the last year, so menu items may have changed, but Provision's \"poutine\" and Josephine's sweet toasts (her peach cardamom jam is AMAZING) are both favorites and repeat orders for me. Husband got some great chicken and waffles here at brunch, and I went healthier with a salmon egg white scramble (Carota Cafe). Balance is key, so we shared.  This is also a really cool space, and they have multiple adjoining rooms that are suitable for private parties. Basically, Smallman Galley is appropriate for any occasion that doesn't involve ballgowns, and even then...I'd go for it. Note: you're notified your order is ready via text, so if you don't have a texting plan (or a cell phone??), sit at the bar alongside the restaurants and they'll bring your order to you.",

    "text": "This is more of a 3.5 star review. I'll start with the pros:  -lots of variety! 4 restaurant menus to choose from! All choices seemed yummy and interesting sounding -bathroom is surprisingly clean for the amount of traffic through here -seating areas are varied and not so cramped -taste of the dishes were great  Cons: -pricey! Yikes! A tiny little vegan pudding served in a 8oz cup was $6! It was delicious but hubby and I finished in all of 4 bites... I got a small pork belly sandwich with side salad for $14 and hubby got a ham and egg on sourdough bread for $9 -small portions. I didn't leave hungry or anything but let's just say our plates were CLEAN -tipping here is uncomfortable and confusing. Okay, so you are basically penalized for using a credit card b/c the screen pops up a a predetermined amount and it's ridiculous: 20%? 25%? 30%? 35%? Are you effing kidding me? People who paid with cash in front of us didn't tip at all and somehow that's acceptable? In this type of DIY establishment, I would probably tip only 10% since the plates are super pricey already and you have to grab your own water, cups, napkins and utensils. My hubby tipped 16% on top of our $30 and we got almost no service except for our food brought out to us from a short distance. I just hated that there was a prompt in there when using your card--it's tacky and unnecessary.   Would I come back? Well, the hubby really enjoyed it and I would like to try some other options too but I'm not sure I would highly recommend it to others. It's more of a concept rather than a great idea. Sunday brunch time was medium crowded but I read that weekend nights are horrendously crowded.",

This kind of reminds me of Pittsburgh public market however it is all closer together. I picked flank steak toast from Josephine's toast, it was a bit pricy but it's so delicious!! I really enjoy it. We also got a buttermilk brownie which is just average. I looked around people's food, they all look very sophisticated and yummy. I would definitely come back again to try different chefs.",

However, I asked them to leave off the Sriracha and jalapenos.  He told me the soup itself was not spicy at all.  WRONG!  It was so spicy, could not eat.  That was without the hot stuff!  I was very disappointed.  Also, too many bean sprouts, yuck.  Meat was kind of balled up, not terrific quality and pretty scant.  Egg rolls were okay, but 3 small for $5 was a bit steep.  $15 for pho was 2x overpriced.  Overall poor impression, wish we would have tried the other vendors there.",

    "text": "Smallman Galley is a restaurant incubator across the bridge from my house in the Strip District. Every year or so, four new rotating chefs open up four new concept restaurants. It's a great value, providing a wide range of foodie options for a reasonable price. I often take people visiting Pittsburgh here or people who are picky eaters or on restricted diets. Despite its ability to provide higher-end dining at a lower-end cost, the speed/vibe of it is more fast-casual since they don't accept (or really need for most nights) reservations. They use some basic electric ordering/queuing technology to make service more efficient and have communal long tables to maximize the space. I enjoy its laid-back, bohemian vibe along with the great food. In the current class of restaurants, I would recommend \"Iron Born\" if you're curious what Detroit-style pizza actually is and \"Home\" for upscale variations on comfort food like Chicken & Biscuits, even TV dinners.",

    "text": "Perfect spot for large group dinner, brunch, and even better for happy hour. Smallman Galley is the first \"restaurant incubator\" of its time, offering four totally separate/different kitchen concepts under one roof, with a full service bar on the adjacent side of the building. Very cool that Pittsburgh is the first to offer such a model. The four kitchen concepts just rotated out, and the second set of chef's just set up in early June 2017. The four different kitchens all have their own concept with their core menu, plus new items continuously popping up week to week. You order and pay at each individual kitchen, then are given a number and asked to seat wherever you please, and your food will be brought out once ready. The full service bar is always packed and offers some of the best cocktails, wine, plus a huge craft beer menu featuring your favorite creations from the city's best microbrews. They feature an awesome happy hour, half off all wine, beer, and cocktails from 5-7 Tuesday-Friday. Commonplace Coffee also just set up shop inside, so you can grab yourself one of their awesome espresso drinks. Seating is on a first-come, first-serve basis, with long tables for communal type seating. There are a few TVs inside. Draws a crowd for happy hour and during the weekends, especially for brunch. So excited that a second location is opening on the North Side in Nova Place. We'll get the chance to experience three new concepts, since one of the original kitchens from the first class of chefs, Provision, will be featured against in the second SG location.",

    "text": "Amazing concept (four higher-end incubator restaurants serving food cafeteria-style in a trendy space in the Strip)....I'm not sure about the execution though.  My husband and I came here with some friends on a Saturday night around 8. People, heed my advice....do not come here on a Saturday night around 8. This place was bonkers and it's just not set up to handle being uber busy. I'm okay with organized chaos, but this was just....chaos.   It's every man, woman, and child for himself in terms of seating, and there were no seats to be had when we were there. The space is definitely not big enough for the amount of people wanting to be there. It doesn't help that this seems to be a sit-and-linger-with-friends kinda place, so table turnover was low. Having a hostess or some kind of way to manage seating besides trying to shark your own table would help the flow here tremendously.  After about 30 mins, we did manage to pounce on a table once some people left. We went up to order. Again...kind of chaotic. Huge lines were forming, and most of the restaurants only had two people behind the counter (frantically cooking), so the service was non-existent. After standing in line for Aubergine for about 10 mins, we were told that they weren't taking any new orders until they finished their current plates. So I had a drink, came back 20 mins later, stood back in line for another 10 mins to order, only to be told that what I wanted was sold out. Ugh. Disappointing to say the least. Anyway, I ordered my second choice dish and waited about 20 mins for it to be ready.  So, despite the chaos around the seating and ordering, how was the food? From Aubergine, my friend and I both got the fresh pasta with seasonal root vegetables and pesto. OMG. This pasta was to die for. The pesto sauce was so flavorful...very well-balanced and not too oily. The root vegetables were roasted to perfection and went well with the pesto sauce. And the pasta itself...mmm...so tender, yet al-dente. Overall, I really loved my meal at Aubergine. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with my carrot soup starter, which I got from Carota Cafe. I got the last bowl of soup they had, so it was lukewarm, and it was essentially flavorless. Everyone at the table tried it and we all agreed that it kind of tasted like baby food in soup form. The soup is vegan and for me, a well-done vegan soup does not make me miss the dairy...but in this case, the carrot soup was screaming for some texture and richness that would have been helped by some cream. Overall, a very big miss here. My husband got a banh mi with fries from Provision. While the bahn mi was definitely creative (chicken skin, liver smear, pickles, jalapeno, cilantro, mint, mayo), it just seemed a little...underwhelming. I dunno. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind-blowingly delicious. I feel like the chicken skin wasn't able to stand on its own as the main component of the sandwich. It needed another meat or something else to make it more substantial. And the fries that accompanied it, unfortunately, were salty to the point of being inedible.   Overall, I love the concept and I'd like to go back and give it another shot when it's less of a mad house. The food and experience were mixed, so I can't give this place any higher than 3.5 stars for now, but there's always next time...",

    "text": "The idea is really good--it's more or less a small upscale food court, with each restaurant / vendor serving full menus. That means that you have the opportunity to order from several different places and try a variety of things. Although if you're getting full entrees, that might be a bit difficult since they all seem to be pretty big portions!  Coming in past the normal lunch time on a Saturday afternoon, we found that there were not too many customers milling around, so plenty of seating was available. We ordered a pork belly omelette from Aubergine and a power bowl (acai bowl with yogurt) + matcha from Carota. The wait for both was minimal, and both were pretty large (even the power bowl, for only $6). The omelette came with a side salad and the meat was very tender and flavorful. The power bowl had a lot of fresh blueberries and golden berries, as well as sweet granola and goji berries. Finally, the cup of matcha, while a bit on the small side, was a delightfully refreshing blend of almond milk, mint, and matcha powder. This was overall a great combination of entree, dessert, and drink.  The space itself is pretty conducive to the concept, if not a bit awkward. There's a table at the front and some counter seating along the wall, as well as what I assume to be tables for the Galley in the back. I can see how, when it gets crowded, the space would fill up fast and make it hard to order, and it could also get pretty loud. On the other hand, it's an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs at work.",

You've heard the rants; you've heard the raves, but you should hear them again. Or maybe you haven't. Four chefs in one building just kinda experimenting and learning how to make food; then in eighteen months they'll leave for their own restaurant and to make way for a new chef. Providing people liked them and they were successful. Chances are, with this kind of buzz and hype flying around about Smallman Galley alone, any chef that enters within it's support will succeed.   First off, I ordered some toast from, I'll let you guess, Josephine's Toast. Avocado toast. That alone was worthy of five stars. I would totally go to a brick and mortar House of Toast by Josephine.   Provision lured me in with their Roasted Beets, because I'd never had anything like that before. Slabs of beets sitting in preserved lemon jam, a pile of crisp watercress sprinkled with crunchy quinoa granola, and roasted mushrooms and cashews tossed over the whole mess. This amazing mix was well worth the try even if it was by far not my favorite thing I've eaten.   The BAD BAD problem here is that an hour and a half drive for a meal is generally not justifiable. Which is what I'll have to do multiple times in order to try several dishes from every single chef that ever walks through these doors.",

    "text": "This review is solely for the bar.  We were there for a cocktail competition. We got there early, so started with some house cocktails (from the menu).  They were barely drinkable they were so bad.  Decided to try an old fashioned after that - not on the menu, but standard bar fare.  It was sickly sweet. What a waste of good bourbon.  Then the cocktail competition - WOW were those drinks bad.  Not fair to hold that against this bar, since none of the competitors were in-house, but the house bartenders were bad enough to earn their own 2 stars.  Sorry guys. Love the concept.  Would love to try some of the food, but have yet to see any of the rotating restaurants offer much in the way of vegetarian fare.  Would definitely not return for drinks.",

    "text": "Fresh, often local, ingredients with inventive, ever-changing menus. There are basically 4 different concepts/restaurants under the roof of Smallman Galley. We went to three of them. Apparently the \"concepts\" shift every 18 months.   Rapini Grilled Cheese ($13) - Carota Cafe - the sandwich was packed with good cheddar cheese and topped with charred broccoli rabe and on the side was a fresh green salad.   Fettuccine pasta - Aubergine Bistro - the pasta itself was good. The dish had a light spring flavor with bright green peas and sugar snap peas in a thin buttery sauce. Overall, it was very good.   Egg salad - accompanied by a large-leaf lettuce salad and usually bread which my mom didn't order. The salad was too creamy for me but it was seasoned well and the egg whites were silky - perfect.   Smashed Avocado toast with toasted flaxseed - my mom got this with gluten free toast. The toast was a dense, chewy GF bread. The smashed avocado was good.  Overall, a unique, delicious experience. There are so many more items I'd love to try. Nothing knocked my socks off but everything was very good. 4.5/5",

    "text": "This place. Is. Awesome. Definitely a new favorite.   Four chefs compete to have a space in this \"restaurant incubator\" with an 18 month opportunity to curate and perfect their own special creations. The only problem I have is it takes me so damn long to decide what the heck I want!   One thing to love about this place is that although these chefs are here temporarily before they open their own place, they are NOT joking around. They have experience. Their food is good. And you are definitely getting a fair deal; once these chefs move on to their own restaurant, their stuff is going to cost a lot more - eat it up while you can.   Right now you have:  Rafael at Aubergine Bistro is offering a mix of \"everything from Creole to Cajun to Baja.\" I've had his pot pie, and its really good. He's worked at Spoon, Legume, and Hyeholde which are all great places.  Jessica at Carota Cafe is working with local farms to provide \"vegetable-forward\"dishes using natural/sustainable/humane foods. She's the former Sous Chef from The Commoner, and also was a contestant on \"Hells Kitchen.\" I went the other day, and was apparently the first to try her Moqueca (a Brazilian seafood stew... that I had to pronounce before I could order haha) and WOW. It reminded me a bit of curry, served with rice, delicious, and was the perfect thing the day after a big snow storm.  Jacqueline of Josephine's toast makes all kinds of things that you'd like to eat, except ON TOP OF TOAST. She's worked with The Common Plea, Marty's Market, Eleven, Isabela, and also appeared on Food Network's Cutthroat Kitchen. Not to mention, she's rad.   I'd have to say my favorite right now is Stephen's Provision PGH. After repeatedly ordering food from him, I find myself being forced to try other peoples things, since his are just so hard to say no to. There's no real pinpoint of specific cultural influence, rather how all the flavors from different cultures have influenced meat in the US. He does a good job at bringing together many different flavors and unexpected things to make one great dish.  There's more.  The bar is just as wonderful as the food. There are 20 local beers on tap, and each chef has a few special cocktails on the bar menu. Also, Veronica, the bartender, has stolen my heart. Not just because she's cute and nice, but she is extremely talented, and can whip you up something great. =]  And for everyone that loves coffee, theres a coffee and espresso bar that opens at 8am pretty much every day.   TRY IT.",

These had a great flavor and some spice. I would go back and order these again and not share this time. We also had the smoked salmon poke bowl - also delicious. Great flavors, fresh and tasty.  Next we had the steak sandwich w fries and the short rib entree from Home. The fries were hot and tasty and the steak sandwich had great flavor. My only complaint about that was the bread was so hard to chew/bite. The short rib entree - outstanding. Enough said.  Then we had 2 pizzas come to the table from Iron Born. The red top was really yummy, hot and delicious, crispy where it needed to be. I have had better Detroit style pizza at Aiello's in Harrison City, but the pizza at Iron Born was still good. We also got the Vodka pizza. I typically like a vodka sauce and this was just ok. I'd go back and try the white pizza next time.  Smallman Galley is a great concept and a wonderful to get all different types of food on a table. One complaint it was really hot in there. We sat at one of the tables right up front.",

There are four different stands to choose from as well as two bar areas. I picked a home-style stand that's currently there and got \"The Burger\" which was really good! It had arugula, an egg, cheese, some type of truffle cream, and mushrooms. I could eat that every day. I also got a cinnamon roll, which really threw me off. I was expecting it to be sweet but it was very savory with a sort of pepper jelly and bacon on top. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't my idea of a cinnamon roll either, so I was pretty disappointed with it.",

So, I went for the popular choice and I am glad I did that.  It is very delicious and I am not sure what they topped it off with. But it seemed to be a mix of cheese and mashed potatoes. I loved the pie and it is neither too heavy nor too light. Just the right amount for two people.   My friends ordered curry and noodle soup from the Vietnamese restaurant. The curry was good but my friend didnot like the noodle soup and felt like it is over priced for the taste and quality.   Overall, I highly recommend the pie if you are here.",

It's nice to know that these small businesses don't have to worry about their location costs when making the best food they can!   Although it's a lot of different flavors, the ability to try a bunch of things and share among a few friends or family is priceless. It's my favorite quality about this place: diversity in the menu. Also, we took recommendations only from the waitress and I can safely say she has good taste!  We got tacos from the Vietnamese place, iron born pizza, and a burger as well. The tacos were so good we got seconds and tasted very fresh. The tortilla complimented the sauces and meat nicely, which was surprising to me. The pizza was thick and the dough was airy and sweet. It was almost as if you could taste the amount of time and effort put into making that dough. The burger was delicious. It was juicy and flavorful and just made me want to eat more.  I would highly suggest coming here with a large group of people so that you have the chance to share and experience more! This is definitely a place to try new things and try a lot of them.",

There is something for everyone here, it's the literal solution for \"I don't know, you pick\" date nights.   My boyfriend and I come here often for happy hour on Fridays, which is 5-7PM, 1/2 off all drinks. You really can't beat it. The cocktails here are phenomenal- last night I had the \"Shock Me, Shock Me With That Deviant Behavior\", a great name for a great cocktail. The bar is always crowded, which makes the quick service and well made drinks even more impressive.   I have not been to every restaurant inside, because Iron Born Pizza is so good. Everytime I go to Smallman, I say I'm going to try something new...and I end up trying a new pizza. This isn't just pizza, it's always a meal. The topping combinations are so well thought out and you definitely won't see them anywhere else in the city. Their sweet and tangy wings are immaculate- fried to perfection.   Home is also a super cool eatery with really good food. The TV dinner trays you see floating around the dining room always look delicious. But the Quack Mac they recently put on the menu is just something else. Confit duck and crispy duck skin!? Making a balanced Mac n cheese is something that is really hard to do. The quack mac is perfection- all of the elements compliment each other and create a cohesive, scrumptious dish.   My overall take on this Smallman Galley: it's a must try spot in Pittsburgh. The menus of these places all seem to change seasonally, so there's often new food and drinks to try. The service is great and the vibes are good.",

Iron Born- White pie Colonia- Pupusa with beans Banhmilicious- Rice with chicken brunoise- Chorizo mac and cheese, Smores dessert  You order at each of the stands and they give you a number. You find a seat, leave the number on your table, and the wait staff brings your food to your seat. We ordered from all four of the stands and everything came out about the same time! Everything was delicious, but the mac and cheese and smores from brunoise were to die for. Ive never seen a Smores dessert deconstructed like that! It was definitely unique and I was not expecting that kind of dessert- in a good way. It was pretty packed arnd dinner time on Saturday, but wasnt too hard to find seats. Definitely recommend!",

I tried the White Pie from Iron Born with garlic cream. It was the new thick crust sicilian style that's popular now.  Would definitely stop back to try other food. I like this new high end food court concept but want more original, adventurous and crazy food choices.",

The place has open seating, so once you order from one of the 4 kitchens or bars you take your number to an empty table. The atmosphere reminds me of Union Fare or Chelsea Market in NYC. Smallman Galley is unique in its mission: it supports up and coming Pittsburgh chefs by providing them a platform to share their innovative culinary ideas, renditions, and concepts. I'd say that most of the menu options are typically pricier than I'd like but WORTH the trip.  Banhmilicious -Rice ($12.15): Ordered w/ chicken. Originally, nervous that the dish would be the very bland - just the basic rice & chicken. Instead, the dish exhibited wonderful flavor  Colonia -Cochinita Pibtl ($14): I'm partial to any dish that has pork, so I naturally chose the marinated pork with pickled red onions and rice. The meat was tender with a smokey flavor. Didn't taste too fatty or dry. Overall, the dish was delicious and filling -Churros ($7): Fun-shaped and paired with thick chocolate sauce. They were kind of oily and wished they had more crunch -Divorce Bowl",

    "text": "Thanks to Breanna B for recommending this place!  I cannot even begin to describe how much I love this concept and how successful this execution was!  The concept of having restaurant incubator in a city is a great concept, a way to get new chefs started in the crazy business of owning and operating a restaurant.   For a consumer this concept is great because you get to try what new ideas the new chefs are coming up with and if you have picky friends, they'll find something in the many options available.  I decided to try Colonia, because I have a weakness for Latin cuisine, and I love the idea of a restaurant exploring the less mainstream options for Latin food. I loved the pupusas and pao de queijo.  My friends selected Brunoise and Iron Born for their lunches and we were very happy with the food.  The drinks were equally tasty, all in all a very successful outing.  Our only issue was with service, some of the people that work there seem to be unfriendly and a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps this should be part of their training, customer service.",

I like the idea of having a variety of different cuisines all in one restaurant. That makes it easy during those times when one simply can't decide what they want to eat.   My husband and I went with the Vietnamese station (can't remember the name). He got the Bahn Mi and I got the jerk chicken tacos. I understand that the chefs are using quality ingredients, but the three tacos I got left me wanting more and still hungry. My husband finished one half of his sandwich and it was fantastic! But the other half had these weird synthetic strings in it?  It was not an ingredient. It looked like hair but was much more coarse than that. Maybe some fibers off a grill or basting brush? We weren't too sure, and didn't feel like making a fuss as he had already finished most of his food. Unfortunately, it left a bad taste in his mouth and he refused to finish what was left of his sandwich after he found the strings. Bummer.   I think we will try Smallman again, maybe another station, and in the afternoon when we went. My husband went with his father one night and said it was absolutely packed, so beware and be ready to stand around many other hungry customers!",

I talked to the bartender about why I didn't like the drink and he assured me that I could swap it out for another one.

The ambiance is rustic- with metal, wood, and brick. The bar was decent sized and I was lucky to find a spot, as it was filling up quickly. Sat down and waited a couple minutes and was eventually waited on.   One of the amazing things about the bar is they have a TON of local beers on draft. So if you're all about supporting local, this is your place. I ended up ordering a mixed drink, because the special is half off all beer, wine, and cocktails from 5-7, so it ended up being only $5. It was decently strong, and very tasty. I only had time for one drink, but you really can't beat that deal. Overall it's a great spot to catch up with a friend, and I'm excited to go back sometime.",

My brunch favorites from each of the establishments:  Josephine's Toast:  Smashed Avocado Toast with flax seed, olive oil, and cilantro + egg.  Aubergine Bistro: pork belly omelette.  Carota Cafe: squash or zucchini grilled cheese...with an egg of course and Provision...get the fries.  You won't be sorry.

Currently, the four restaurants serving are fantastic. I have had each one. I will give a slight shout out to Iron Born, even though they don't need it, because I want to see this Pizza shop open for years to come. The two bars are also on rotation and most likely hold the same lease length. Go support local chefs and their dreams, eat delicious food, and have a great date night with your lady or fellow.",

    "text": "The food here was amazing but the overall experience is confusing and the service is lacking. There is no one to greet you when you come in or explain to you how this works, which I think would be super helpful.. I also think it would be much nicer if you could actually be seated with menus and time to decide instead of running back and forth down the lines squeezing between people to try to read each restaurant's chalk board menu. I feel bad for the restaurant staff too, frantically running around trying to track you down after you finally find a table which in itself is an almost impossible task. Once we got our food we realized we had no silverware or waters and had to track down a staff member to ask for them. Also sucks that if you want to have a couple drinks with your meal you have to continually get up and leave your table and wait at the bar to get served.. As I said the food was really great but the overall setup and experience could be majorly improved and is what will keep me from returning. It was more work and stress rather than a nice, relaxing meal out.",

Each of the \"restaurants\" has a different approach, and so it's a great place to take visitors with different interests (which we've done, and everyone loved it).  We bounce around, and try dishes from each concept.  Not all of the kiosks are the same in terms of service (or pleasantness), but we have yet to have a meal that we didn't really enjoy.  Inventive, well seasoned, broadly diverse, always something you're going to be in the mood for.  It really is a great concept, and it just works.  And the bar has a great selection of beers.  We also really like the atmosphere.  As others have said, industrial, chill, bustling, but never beyond capacity.  You can hang as long or as short as you like.    So why 5-stars?  I normally reserve 5-star ratings for places that do something truly innovative.    I wouldn't say that I've had \"mind-blowing food\" here.  (Not like Yasu in Toronto for example)  But we were there last week, and we both thought, \"Wow, we really like living here.\" Hard to find a better compliment than a place that makes you love where you live.",

    "text": "Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.  The one funny quirk is their delivery of the dish... you order and you desperately try to find a seat.  If you do find one, it is often a comical dash of seeing your food pass you twice because the server cannot see the number on your table.  We've had this happen 5 times and each time, I've had to chase down the confused person.  Seeing how most of the time it is the chef delivering it, I feel bad as they shouldn't be walking frantically to find this tiny number.    I've tried items from Brunoise, Iron Born, and Bahnmilicious and have rated them individually in their respective yelp profiles.  Overall, I would say that Iron Born and Brunoise stand out in a good way and I can see them being quite successful.  Brunoise - refined food with visually appealing plating that draws your attention.  It seems odd to see such pretty plates come out such an industrial and hipster place but I really wish I tried more plates than what I did here.  What I did try though was quite delicious and very well priced.  4/5  Iron Born - This is really good pan pizza... I'm not sure what makes Detroit style different from my nostalgia pan pizza but it hit all the right spots.  Crusty edges giving way to a fluffy well cooked and flavourful bread that cradled a lot of flavourful toppings.  We go the spicy pizza and the unique addition of the spicy honey made it stand out.  4/5  Banhmilicious - I want to give this a chance and wanted something lighter so the summer rolls seemed ideal.  Unfortunately it was bland and compared to the Iron Born Pizza, it didnt seem to give the same weight as a good meal.  3/5  I do have to commend the staff here as they are hustling and constantly cleaning.  There is a decent amount of tables but on a Friday evening, I felt that it was so hard to get a single table... we saw a lot of people just chilling and not eating.  So for us who just needed two seats for 30 minutes to eat, we were stuck.  Either way, I really wish these chefs a great start, improve with each lesson learned, and become successful.",

The entry way has plenty of seating, although the space has been busy when I've been there, I think an average day might allow for larger groups to be seated for breakfast. There is a separate bar area - offering a full bar for cocktails and local draught beers. The coffee bar, near the other entrance, connects to the bar area - offering different feels for the space. Next to the kitchen area there are also bar seating for smaller groups or individual patrons.   This would be a great venue for a private event as well. We looked into it for a celebration at one time and were very interested in the private patio area and separate spaces. We didn't end up going in that direction, but it was a great venue that I would recommend others taking a look at.",

    "text": "There is nothing small about Smallman Galley. Even when its jam packed with Yelpers crowding around the bar for a drink it still feels like enough space. Yes, Smallman Galley in the Strip District has an impressive wine and cocktail list but that's not what makes this unique venue so special. When visiting here you're essentially eating at several very different restaurants. Smallman is an incubator for chefs looking for eager mouths to feed. Think of Smallman Galley as a wingman for aspiring restaurateurs introducing them to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Not only are chefs given a platform/venue to feed people they're also prepped with knowledgeable information on branding and running a successful restaurant because all they have is eighteen months to devour this information. After that the next set of chefs are ready for their shot. It's a genius idea as there's enough room for creativity in the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the four current restaurants calling Smallman Galley home and every chef showed up with passion, love for food, and one heck of a menu.  Chef Pete Tolman isn't from Detroit but his pizza is. He saw a hole in the Pittsburgh pizza market and that was the birth of Iron Born Hand Forged Pizza. His food is made to order with the freshest ingredients and although I didn't get the chance to gobble up his pizza (it had pepperonis on the samples) I hear great things about his white pizza. The crust looks insanely flakey. If you can't find a pizza you like on this menu (which is unbelievable) you can always build your own.  Colonia's Chef Jesse Barlass ruined salads for me. I no longer want one unless it's as exciting as Colonia's summer salad. I had just a sample of his pepino and jicama salad and man,  everything worked in such harmony that it sealed the deal for me to come back and try the full menu. And don't think for one minute that you'll get canned beans or store brought tortillas because he makes everything from scratch. The idea of marrying Latin flavors from colonist cultures is brilliant. Barlass definitely knows flavor.  I don't eat beef or pork and the sample Bahmilicious offered was a pho bone broth but that was not a deterrent. Chef Hao Le explained that mostly everything on the menu can be adapted for vegetarian as they have vegan broth. Their most popular item is their build your own pho. You could go safer with something else but no matter what you pick, you'll leave full.  \"Are you sure there's no meat in this risotto Not even the broth?\" I stared at Chef Ryan Peters of Brunoise very weary of his risotto. The flavor was unbelievable and I was just afraid I was eating something that I shouldn't have. He assured me that nothing but love and hours upon hours of care was in the risotto. If the rest of the menu is as flavorful as his risotto, he'll have zero problems opening up his own space. Brunoise specializes in locally sourced fine dining. You can quickly go from a burger to a peanut butter and jelly macaron.  From the outside Smallman Galley isn't nearly as interesting as its chefs and staff that keep the place going. One thing is certain, don't wait too long to give the galley a try because you just might miss out on the beginnings of Pittsburgh's best new restaurant.",

    "text": "This is a unique spot in the Strip! I went with a few friends for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was a little congested, but it wasn't very hard to find a seat. I love the environment, and it is a cool concept. There are four different restaurants to choose from, each with a small menu, and all of them have a unique flair to them. I tried a burger at Brunoise. It was very good, but it was the bun was a little too buttery for my taste. The burger was cooked to perfection though, and the hollandaise mayo, cheese, and egg were delicious together.   While I enjoyed the experience, it may be a little bit before I venture back. The concept is a little overwhelming for me, and if I didn't have a seasoned vet with me, I probably would have panicked. They do rotate restaurants every 6 months to a year, so I will def keep my eyes out for the change. I didn't get to try any alcoholic bevs, but it looked like they had a decent selection.",

I eat pizza all over (Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, London, and Rome).  The Red Pie is EXCELLENT.  I had not had Detroit-style before.  It is amazing, or at least Iron Born's version is.  The crust is tall, but light - almost fluffy.  There is some yellow cheese on the edges that gets crispy and crunchy.  The sauce on top just works somehow.  This is a simple pie - basically a pepperoni.  It is about 6\" x 10\", cut into six pieces.  My friend got the spicy pie (can't remember the specific name), and he rated it very highly as well.  It has jalapeno and banana peppers, but he said it was not overwhelmingly spicy, but was just right.  I do not give five-star ratings very often.  This pizza earns it.  I will be back.",

Everything you needed it to be. Colonia was great but I've had better pupusas unfortunately. I'm planning on going back tomorrow cause I wanted to try more.

We talked to the cashiers, who were super friendly, about the concept of the restaurant itself and also about the bar. We didn't order anything else, but spent a long time looking at the menus and they all seemed to be innovative and diverse.

    "text": "Review of Colonia. 4* with lots of potential! Best Hispanic food I've gotten in Pittsburgh hands-down.   My wife and I just checked out the new concepts at Smallman and decided to go with Colonia for some intriguing Latin American dishes. We started with pao de queso (crisped but tender cheese bread rolls) and a chicken papusa (stuffed masa cake) and had the casamiento (rice and black bean and vegetables) 'divorce' bowl for our entree.   The pao was delicious, crispy and savory on the outside, and revealing a moist and chewy innard that housed the accompanying spread nicely. Don't let the $8 price tag deter you because they are hard to make right and are absolutely delicious.   Papusa was not my favorite because the thickness of masa needed to hold the stuffing in was a bit much (prefer tamale thickness I guess?) but the flavors were spot on perfect and the pickled cabbage and carrots paired well. The leftovers of this were actually better than the day of because I think the moisture of the fresh masa had some time to leech out making the thickest bits less chewy.   Our entree was a good choice. It's vegetarian (incidental not lifestyle) but very satisfying. The 'divorce' version added more jalapeno and spice which was done well. All in all the rice, beans, corn, jicama, etc all were cooked and seasoned very well. I think a corn tostada added as a side would complete the experience give a little more texture to the dish, but again it was a satisfying and delicious meal. It's a lot of food so don't be afraid to split this!   After a good first round, we look forward to trying the excellent meat options next visit (amber jack, flank steak we're looking at you!).",

The beer selection was killer, the happy hour prices were really good and the vibe was overall really inviting and nice. I appreciate a place that can cater to a larger and more diverse crowd. Kids are also welcome. I was with a larger group and I am not crazy about bar stool seating height, but that's what we got during an otherwise busy time of day. The only other thing that I thought was eh, was the vinyl record menu thing. Just seemed a little \"trying to hard to be hip\" - you don't need it smallman galley, you are already doing it!",

I can't review the current food as the chefs and all change every 18 months and I haven't tried the newest four (basically, four counters each offering a mini-restaurant's menu with a chef that passed a test to get in). I think the standards to get a spot there are quite high. I was never disappointed by the first round of mini-restaurants/chefs.  The space is wonderfully casual. Long tables with water and water glasses waiting for you; stations with your silverware, napkins and more for you to help yourself...and the bar. Oh my gosh, they've hired some of the best bartenders in the city to make drinks in this quite large bar area. Even if you're not hungry, go for the drinks. They will not let you down.",

Iron Born was generally my favorite of the restaurants here, serving up personal Detroit-style pies big enough to feed just about any appetite with crispy, well-caramelized crust, tangy sauce, fresh-tasting cheese and meats.  Despite my love for Iron Born, I have to say that most of the other vendors I've had at Smallman have been a little underwhelming, but part of the fun is going to see if the new places are any good.",

    "text": "I have wanted to come check this place out ever since I saw some photos in my feed from an event organized here by the Pittsburg Yelp CM and so was super psyched when local Yelper Phil G suggested coming here for dinner.  It was easy to find parking just a block away and yay, no payment needed after 6pm. Walking into the Smallman Galley, I knew I was in for a treat straightaway - it just had a buzz and a vibe I could feel in the air!   And I loved the curated restaurants! In one evening I had food from x3 continents! Vietnamese Ice Tea (Asia), Papusa (South America) and Chestnut Soup (Europe)! How cool was it to be able to travel the world, food-wise, without leaving Pittsburgh!  So my thoughts on food & menu as below:  Colonia - cuisines of Latin America 1) I ordered a Pork Pupusa ($6.00) and this was topped with a really lovely tarty fermented slaw with jalapenos pieces that would occasionally pop up and dance in my mouth and cause me to drink up my glass of water in a gulp. I loved the fresh taste of the corn tortilla but one thing - this is a massive plate of food, so would recommend getting it as an entree to share.  2) Yelper Phil G ordered the dessert plate of Churros with chocolate dipping sauce ($6.00). This came pipping hot and and I was super happy that the sugar and cinnamon taste was restrained. For me the highlight however was that dipping chocolate! Reader, I licked that bowl clean - yes, both my dining companions teased me, but I dont care. That Mexican chocolate was so lovely and whatever spices were added, it was thoroughly addictive. Absolutely Recommend!  Banhmilicious 1) I got my drink from here - a glass of Thai Tea for $4.00. I feel these guys are a wee bit cheap. I requested the Thai Tea to be without ice and rather than getting a full glass, I got a 3/4 glass full. I was really taken aback when handed the drink and didn't query the lack of getting a full drink, but wish I had. The taste was superb, but honestly not sure about coming back here, cause I felt like I was gypped from them!!   brunoise 1) I had the most incredible parsnip & chestnut soup with orange slices from here for $8.00, and frankly it was the highlight of my meal. I so want to go back and try everything from the menu here. They were making fresh chirozo when I ordered the soup and that smell was divine! The texture of the soup was so silky smooth and each spoonful was hearty and falvourful! The burnt orange added an incredible taste!! If you like French Cooking, then go here cause you are in the hands of a master!  2) My other colleague ordered the dessert from here - a lovely Lemon Meringue Tart for $8.00. I loved the taste of the mint that was used and the concord grape sorbet was just massively refreshing and to my palate, didnt taste grape-y at all. In fact I thought I was eating something made of apples and prunes and we went back to the restaurant counter to confirm what the Sorbet was made of.  Overall Verdict?? GO GO GO!  PS - I thought of knocking a star down b/c of the service received from Banhmilicious but brunoise & Colonia's food made me so happy, it overcame that lack!  Yelp 67/2018",

I am not big on pumpkin flavored dishes outside of the occasional piece of pie but this soup is sensational. The sweet potatoes with the broth, chicken, noodles and spices make a perfect compliment.  Forged's Spivey pie is a go to for me. I mean the pepperoni, sauce, cheese, and peppers are so delicious. Pair it with their whole fried wings and you have a perfect meal. There homemade chips and dips is also simply delicious and very simple yet so comforting.   Take out or dine in, these two are must try!",

I love with yinzers support yinzers so I'm all about local brews being available!   As cool of a space as it is, and an ideal setting in the strip, it's extremely expensive.

I like to order first, claim a table and then grab a drink from the bar.  I had the Pao de Queijo breakfast sandwich. It was truly one of the most delish sandwiches I have ever had. It was made with Brazilian cheese bread, which is basically a carb from heaven itself. It cradled a dippy egg and some roasted turkey. And since there's no such thing as too much cheese, there was also some chihuahua cheese in there too! The aji aioli was incredible.  I'm glad I branched out and can't wait to try something else next time!",

    "text": "Smallman Galley is a shared space with 4 rotating eateries and a couple bars. At the time of my visit our food options included Home (a modern take on comfort classics), Banhmilicious (modern Vietnamese), Joey's Snack Bar, and Iron Born (hand-forged Detroit-style pizza in the Iron City).  We selected several dishes to share from 3 of the 4 eateries. Each spot gave us a numbered stand to place on our table so our order could be delivered to our table when it was ready.  The first dish to arrive was one of the brunch specials at Home, Home Fries which consisted of Yukon gold potatoes, charred peppers and onions, and Home sauce. These were piping hot, crispy on the outside, fluffy (AND HOT) on the inside, and accented with onions and peppers, microgreens, with little blobs of Home's special sauce. Delicious!  Next up was the Spicy Pie from Iron Born. This thick, crispy crusted pizza is topped with hot sopressata, pepperoni, house banana peppers, and Mike's hot honey. Holy deliciousness, Batman! This is a great pizza! It has a healthy amount of spice, is nicely sauced, and has a fantastic texture.  Our final pick, and the overall favorite, was one of the specials at Banhmilicious. The Pulled Pork and Kimchi Taco features corn tortillas topped with pulled pork, kimchi, mixed lettuce, sriracha, mayo, cilantro, and cucumber. It was also quite spicy, but so delectable and had a wonderful balance of textures and flavors. Big winner here!  Overall, I LOVED visiting Smallman Galley. It's an amazing concept with really great food in a fun neighborhood.",

    "text": "Smallman is an exciting incubator for chefs and locals alike, to try diverse and classic foods from around the world.  However, despite the atmosphere and the selection, the execution of the food falls under standard. For example, I ordered a Detroit Style pizza from Iron Born, and although it was alright, it was just that. A lot of bread, and some touches of finesse on the top.  More disappointing was Colonia, which gave a nice presentation and ambitions for a fancy dish, but made a mediocre food. For the flank steak, the meat was essentially rubber and the rest of the veggies were very strongly flavored. For the chicken bowl, there were these donut shaped starch things, and a ton of extraneous veggies. I'm not even sure if there was chicken, but the dish was so salty I didn't bother finding out. Overall, my impression of Colonia was that the chefs were trying too hard...I think it's important to  keep the essential parts of the dish simple, not to over salt things, and not to crowd the plate with a jambalaya of ingredients.  Overall, I had an underwhelming experience, but Smallman is still a very legit place with great options and cooling culture.",

The restaurant incubator concept is SO cool - and the caliber of food tastiness and options is even better. I've come here with friends, coworkers, and even my grandmother, and I've yet to see anyone I know (or don't know) leave unenthused.   As a note: If you're weary of crowds, or have more than one small child with you, or more than one grandmother, you might want to time your arrival outside of peak lunch and dinner hours.  Otherwise, make your selections (so hard to choose!), grab a drink, and enjoy!",

    "text": "Oh. My. Gosh. I want to go here every night of the week! A group of 5 of us went here on a Thursday night, we were lucky enough to find a vacant table immediately - most others appeared to have to wait, and the majority is shared seating. The atmosphere is pretty trendy/hipster, casual, and busy. You could honestly walk right past this place without seeing it, but I swear it's a beautiful world in there!  Between us we had 4 pizzas from Iron Born: Hand Forged Pizza and all left with bellies full of literal deep-dish heaven. We all couldn't stop talking about just how incredible it was and how fast it was ready!  We also took advantage of happy hour, (5-7pm Tue-Fri) 50% off any drink!!!! With a great selection!  I know that the restaurants rotate, but I'm hoping to get back to SG before the others change, because everyone's dishes looked sooooo good!",

For my first trip I got the quack mac, which simply put, is the best Mac and cheese I have ever had, especially for the price. All the elements of the fish were exciting and played off each other perfectly, something I will admit I did not expect coming out of such a venue. However looks can be deceiving as the crab hush puppies were also exemplary. My second visit I got the meat and potatoes which was a genius idea to combine the perfect gnocchi with high quality meats and some of the best roasted tomatoes I have ever tasted. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves inventive flavor combinations and amazing meat based entrees.",

I'll definitely be back.   I also snagged a taste of a friend's tuna tostada from Joey's. Wow. It was a little difficult to eat (mountains of goodness on the tostada), but well worth it.

I also had a beets and carrots appetizer/side from one of the other concepts (sorry I can't remember the name). It was fresh, but a little bland.

My meal had really great flavors and was the closest to authentic Southern food I've had in Pittsburgh (I'm from NC). The chicken was really crispy and everything on the plate went together in a yummy bite. Only things I would change would be: 1) my grits had lumps in them (I will allow this in Pittsburgh but kind of a grits foul) 2) the biscuit was placed on top of the grits so I couldn't pick it up. My drinks were also excellent--the 21st birthday was nice and fruity and my charity drink was basically a gin and tonic with hibiscus in it--exactly what I wanted! Overall I would return to Smallman Galley to either have the exact same meal or to try something new!",

    "text": "Finally, after what seemed like ages of missed opportunities, my wife and I were able to stop here for a late lunch/early dinner... Or simply put, an off time on a Saturday. And thankfully we did.  What better way to settle the argument about where to eat than to pick a spot with four different restaurants. And it goes without saying that we each chose a different spot, as I went with Provision.  Off the bat, I wasn't overly pleased at being he only one at their counter and not even acknowledged for about 5 minutes as they were all working on some burgers and fries. I decided to order the Banh Mi sandwich and an order of rice pudding. As expected I gave them my number and went to sit at the bar with my wife.  She had already ordered and within 5 minutes her food was served up as she had octopus (I missed the name of the \"restaurant\"). We both glanced around as we didn't have any silverware and nobody was really telling us what to do. Little did we know you grabbed them yourself near where you order the food.  The downside here is that she was finished eating before my food was ready. After receiving two missed calls from a number I didn't recognized I looked down and saw my food was sitting there waiting. So much for the text message as that didn't happen for either of us?  I went down to pick up my food and once again, no acknowledgement. The Banh mi sandwich was good, but all it really made me do is wish I was up the street at Lucy's. The pork was good, a little overly crispy, and the pickled vegetables didn't have much acidity. It also needed some heat but jalapenos were absent. I did really enjoy their fries - but once again, no ketchup and no real help from anyone.  The rice pudding though? Absolutely out of this world good, and I was glad I didn't pass up ordering it.  I adore this concept, and will certainly be back... However they seem to have some things still not figured out. I can only imagine how crazy it could get in here during brunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Great concept! I really love the idea of housing different possible starter restaurants under one building. I believe each restaurant is there for a short period of time to allow them to test their dishes and really hone in on their skills as a chef, test their dishes, raise money, and build their customer base. It's a just fun and exciting environment for their customers too. I love it!  Overall I feel like I'm watching chopped because of their open kitchen and it looks like their competing but their not. Maybe for customers! Ha! Currently there are four restaurants: Provision, Aubergine, Josephine's Toast, and Carota Cafe.  Provision: you can't go wrong because they're safe and serve burgers and sandwiches with a twist. I really love the ingredients. However, some of their ingredients did not pair well together. I've tried their take on a bahn mi sandwich and while I did think it was unique and interesting, I didn't think it was great. I was wanting something meaty other than the crispy skins. The rice pudding dessert sounded like a cool combination of flavors (strawberries, rice pudding, bread, cream) but it was terrible. I like how they think outside of the box and aren't afraid to try out new things! Love the GF options as well!  Aubergine: I love love love it! I've had their deconstructed pot pie and it was amazing! Pan seared mackerel was perfect and served with carolina rice. I've never had that kind of rice before and it was so delicious and paired well with the fish. Kale and grits (GF option) is amazing! I'm from the south and Aubergine made it perfectly! That's how you make grits! (also your google website to leave comments isn't working). I've had other dishes here and I have nothing but great things to rave about!   Carota Cafe: looks like they have some great options. I think they would do excellent as well. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the cafe yet because of the other the overpowering wonderful options the other restaurants offer. Sorry! But I believe you'll do great things!  Josephine's Toast: I love the toast! My favorite is the smashed avocado and the egg, if you can eat it, is a must! I also love the beet/salad greens & the mushroom toast. Yum! I wanted to try the pineapple/cottage cheese but I'm allergic to pineapples.  Would like to try their brunch menu's sometime soon!",

It ended up being the perfect choice for a cute rehearsal dinner the day before our wedding. We rented out the back room, and our event was about 50 people.  All of our friends had Yelped Smallman Galley and had really high expectations for the food--the chefs did not disappoint. The first course included passed appetizers that were served while all the guests mingled, and the other three courses were served on the large beautiful wooden tables. The main course included a vegetarian dish, seasonal lamb, and curried seafood.   Noelle, our primary contact, was at the event the whole time and made sure everything ran smoothy. The Smallman staff were so fun and friendly! We were visiting from San Francisco, and had a reunion wedding in Pittsburgh, and although we couldn't invite everyone to the dinner itself, it was so awesome to have the Smallman Bar there as a way to get a large group of people together.   The only reason this is a 4 star is because we had a hard time getting a contract signed with Smallman, and the initial communication was choppy. I'd recommend that the Smallman team have someone to man the phoneline, because it's really hard to communicate exclusively via email. I reached out in October and didn't really have a contract signed until June-ish when we absolutely needed to send wedding invites out. We were working with someone who'd often go 5 weeks without reply, but once Noelle got involved, she was extremely attentive and even compensated us half the deposit for the trouble. Overall, this is a great business concept, run by some awesome people. Thanks to Noelle and the whole team for an amazing event.",

We had yams, gnocchi, and octopus (this was three separate dishes split between the two of us). The gnocchi was the show stopper. I've never had a dish that was married so well.

    "text": "Simply put, Smallman Galley is worth the hype.  I first visited on a Saturday night around 7pm, and, of course, it was absolutely packed. It took nearly 10 minutes to order and pay for a beer and the tight space made me feel like I was always in the way no matter where I stood. Even so, I would go back in a heartbeat. I ordered Carota Cafe's Horseradish Gnocchi, which was almost impossibly decadent for a vegetarian dish. The bartenders were busy mixing some seriously tempting cocktails, though I chose Brew Gentlemen Co. and Grist House beers from the wide selection of local breweries.  It was a much different scene on my second visit for a Thursday happy hour. This place should be packed for their half-off drinks from 5-7pm, but it was really slow. Not that I'm complaining! It felt like the perfect place for a laid back drink after work. This time I ordered the Provision fries based on the Yelp reviews, and I was blown away. For drinks, I had the sangria (A+) and Raise the Jolly Lager cocktail, which was too sweet for me.  Like others said, what really sets Smallman Galley apart is the atmosphere. If you like to slowly enjoy good food, drinks, and conversation with friends, Smallman Galley will feel like the place you are meant to be. The atmosphere has the energy and warmth that comes from cooking a gourmet meal at home with your closest friends. After reading about the concept of the restaurant on their website, it seems this is exactly what they were aiming for when they dreamt up this \"galley.\"",

    "text": "I visited Smallman Galley a few weeks back with some colleagues for a casual dinner.  I'd been wanting to check it out anyway, so when I saw that it was our destination, it made me all the more eager to go.  We started off by ordering some drinks from the bar, given that we visited during happy hour.  All of the drinks are half off during HH, affording a great opportunity to try them at cut rate.  My drink was a whimsically named one called something like \"You're the DJ, I'm the rhythm\" ($5) that was pomegranate flavored and vodka based, and it went down real smooth.  The bartender mentioned after the fact that the cocktails were created to pair with the offerings from each of the eateries, but even though mine wasn't paired with any of the eateries I chose, I thought it went well with the food that I ordered anyway.  Each of us ordered an appetizer and an entree and we shared them, so we each were able to try a bit of all of our selections.  For my appetizer, I went with the Provision fries ($8) based on the recommendation of several other Yelpers, and for my entree, I went with the pork chop with kale over grits from Aubergine ($17) based on a colleague's recommendation.  While chops aren't my favorite form of pork (I'm a pulled pork girl all the way!), Aubergine's version wasn't half bad.  It did have the chewy texture that I'm not a huge fan of, but it had a nice flavor that was complemented well by the kale and grits.  As for the Provision fries, they were as delicious as other Yelpers made them out to be.  In particular, I enjoyed the variation in texture lent by the components of the dish, which was reminiscent of poutine but a major step up in terms of culinary sophistication.  In addition to my selections, I tried the cheese and toast plate from Josephine's Toast, the roasted beets from Carota Cafe, and the chicken confit (not sure where this one was from).  Of these, the cheese plate was my favorite--it came with several varieties of local cheeses and, of course, miniature toasts.  The roasted beets had a nice firm texture and an earthy flavor, as is appropriate for this dish.  Likewise, the chicken confit had the characteristic smooth consistency and savory flavor of this dish, and was accompanied by a hard boiled egg and pickled veggies, as well as bread for dipping purposes.  The only dish that we ordered that wasn't up to snuff was the kale salad (not pictured), which was rather disappointingly bland.  Given that other reviewers have explained how ordering works, I won't rehash it.  However, I will mention that, aside from its efficiency, another advantage of the system is that it permits ordering items from multiple vendors with ease.  One thing that hasn't been mentioned outright in previous reviews that we found rather amusingly disconcerting are the huge holes in the reclaimed wood planks composing the tops of the tables.  These holes are amazingly conducive to spilling food onto one's legs/the chair/the floor (at least, for a klutz such as me!), so I advise caution in choosing where to sit and placement of dishes.  Overall, I enjoyed Smallman Galley and would definitely consider returning for brunch.  If I visited alone or with a friend, I probably wouldn't order as much, given that the prices aren't exactly inexpensive.  Nevertheless, going with colleagues gave me the chance to sample items from all of the vendors and get a sense of the offerings, which was great for a first visit.  4.5 stars.",

As pizza fiends, Ironborn was the obvious choice. We shared a pepperoni pizza and got extra marinara on the side. The crust was fried and crispy. It was covered in melted cheese and topped with crunchy pepperoni. That was it. We ate it. And it was good. #noregrets",

I think this place is a really cool concept.  There are 4 different pop up style restaurants in one long open space and you can check out each limited menu (4-6 menu items seemed to be the average)before you decide where you want to eat.  The menu variety was great! There were restaurants with pizza, burgers, BLTs, Pork, indian inspired items and rice bowls to name a few.  I went with a BLT with an egg on top and it was delicious!  I have heard that they change the restaurants, so I will for sure come back to test it out again.  It was a little cramped, but I sort of think it fit the type of place it was.",

(Prices ranges between $5-20)  You order food at one of the restaurant stations. They give you a number and bring the food out to you when it's down. For libations, a bar sits directly across from the stations offering all types of beverages to marry with your food selection.   Seating definitely wouldn't be called spacious but it's a pretty cool environment. The bar area is on the rustic side with the trendy Edison bulbs dangling above. There's additional seating in a side area but I didn't get to check that out.",

My boyfriend came back from a trip to Pittsburgh raving about Smallman and the next time we visited we went to Smallman not once but twice in a three day period. The bar stays the same and every 18 months four new restaurant concepts rotate through. The kitchen spaces are TINY and each have impressive menus considering the space they have to work with. One of our visits was just for a drink after breakfast at Pamela's next door but on our other visit our group got ramen, toast, shackshouka, and grits. It might work better for each of the restaurant concepts to have their own yelp page for food and service reviews but since they rotate through I can see why they don't. There were only three people working at each kitchen, I'm sure due to space constraints, but in my experience it left a little lacking in the customer service department. Would love to come back on a future trip and see what future concepts have to offer!",

But since no one else seems to be mentioning it, let me say that the space is too small, cramped, and generally unorganized for the crowd sizes they get. I've been in there 3 or 4 times and it's always been busy, which is great, except for when it's time to get your seats. If you come as just 2 people, it's pretty easy to find some spare seats, but groups of 4+? Good luck. I've had people standing over me waiting for my seats while finishing my food, tapping their toes. I've seen people have \"disagreements\" over who reserved what seats when. I've even been that person, waiting in the corner hoping some seats might open up before my food arrives. All in all, it's uncomfortable that all customers are essentially \"self policing\" in a place that gets absolutely packed. It really verges on totally inhospitable. I don't blame the chefs for this issue -- they're just trying to make the best food they can. But since the space can't magically expand its footprint, the managers/owners should try to find a better way to crowd-control, whether it be staff who controls seating patterns, to some sort of better waiting area, or even keeping people lined up outside until there is room indoors. I know that's a lot of work, but the crazy scene is so unpleasant that it makes it seem more appealing to go somewhere lesser in quality, but better in service and seating.",

I brought my aunt here after an awesome hamachi salad at Provisional so she settled on the fish sammy and I the banh mi there. Unfortunately it seemed that day the chef was heavy handed with the cooking - the albacore in the fish sammy was overcooked that it was rubbery and dry, the side salad was very overdressed, the banh mi was super saucy and the meat in the banh mi had an interesting texture. The side of fries was the only thing we both enjoyed. I'll be back to Smallman Gallery but don't bother with either of these dishes.",

That's ok since these are not experienced restaurateurs, but it does leave you a little disappointed. I just wanted some simple greens and crusty bread this time around and ordered from the Bistro (can't remember the precise name). The salad was fresh but oversalted and the ratio of greens to toppings was way too high. Dressing was simple, clean and tasty. The bread was disappointing. It was advertised and warm baguette with herb butter, but came as toasted, drizzled in olive oil and drowned in salt. I could hardly add the herb butter to that!   The space is welcoming and appealing, but it's super loud when busy and the music was aggressive and way too loud. Hard to hear my friend talk. Ok I sound like a granny, but it felt more like a bar than a place to eat dinner. Much better on a quiet afternoon when it's slow.",

    "text": "The emperor has no clothes! Look, I get what they're trying to do. I applaud the effort to try something new in Pittsburgh. I understand the concept of the  chef incubator. But their claim that you don't need reservations and can easily find a table was not the case on Saturday night. We struggled to find a table for two amid a cacophonous throng. We found ourselves taking off items of apparel just to save a table. The first thing you have to do is find your table. Take off your jacket to save your table, and then step up to the bar to order drinks. You have fight for a place at the bar. You fight for a place at the restaurants. You are spoken to a bit brusquely at the restaurant because they are inundated by orders. This would normally be an activity that would be only witnessed by your server in a traditional restaurant.  Then you make your way back to your seat and shoo away people wondering if your table is available. Once your food comes , you wander aimlessly around looking for a clean Fork. The station where in the cutlery and napkins reside is devoid of clean utensils. You can't find a fork. You give up and go to the restaurant and ask someone at the restaurant at which you ordered to find you a fork. Five minutes later, they courteously come with a fork. Sound like a relaxing evening?  I sat there and watched women in high heels and evening dress bussing their own tables. To be fair, our food was excellent. We ordered the roasted chicken and the prawns carbonara. I had a lentil salad which was delectable. I have absolutely no argument with the quality of the food. I give the food 4 out of 5 Stars. It was inventive and tasty. It was served in a timely fashion. The beleaguered line cook even brought it out to my table. This brings up another topic. In my past trips to the smallman Galley when purchasing food, there has been a opportunity to tip. It was my belief when I tipped my server that I was tipping for service. Generally, at the Smallman Galley, I am walking up to the register and placing my order. I pay for my order. I go back to my seat. When my order is ready, I get up, get my silverware, and bring the plate back to the table. I am assuming that the payment for the food covers the salary of the employees who work there and that there is no need for tipping.  So, in closing, to be fair, you will get an excellent meal. You'll get a very decent drink. But you will pay pretty much what you will pay at a high-end restaurant. For two people with drinks and main course with side, salad, and appetizer we paid about $135 for our evening at Smallman Galley. But I wonder how long it's going to take the throngs of people jamming into the restaurant to figure out that that is what they could pay for an evening out at a nice restaurant and not have to bus their own tables, fight for a spot ordering., look for a fork, fight for a spot at the bar to order a drink, etcetera. Saturday, after a tough work week, should not be a slog and a fight at your favorite restaurant.  But all of this is not to say that Smallman Galley does not have its merits. I think the execution just needs some work. If they had servers and Runners and tableside ordering with iPads or other electronic devices,  the system would work much better. You wouldn't have to fight for a spot at a restaurant. You wouldn't have to bus your own tables. You wouldn't have to fight for a fork. And the tip that you leave would be truly Justified. This is a good idea. The execution though is horrible and needs work if this business model is to continue. And by the way, don't believe that a seat is a foregone conclusion at this restaurant on a busy night. 4 stars for the food, 0 stars for the experience of dining out to equal an average of 2 Stars.",

The only reason for 3 stars instead of 1.5 is because the food is quite good, especially the Bahn Mi from \"Provisions\" and the burger is outstanding.  Other than that, their system is just ridiculous and confusing.  You need to pay at each restaurant and there's no free-flow or continuity within the group of restaurants like where you pay at the end for all sorts and varieties offered.   In other word it's too much work and, Hey if I wanted to work and do all the running I'd stay home and cook my own meal. Your wallet is out all the time...Since you have to pay at each restaurant it's just a bad business model.   The whole point is to enjoy something from each place... With your wallet constantly out it just doesn't work!! You tend to stick to 1 place and so the other stands/restaurants get the shaft. And this is if you're staying IN to eat!  (I could understand this for take-out... But otherwise it's ridiculous).  I can't see this lasting long.  The menus are hard to read, you don't have time to figure things out if it's crowded, you better know what you want (and you see most people squinting and trying to make it out) and keep an eye on how many people you're give your cc to..  Total disappointment!  If they need to explain how to get a meal.. DOESN'T WORK! It's stupid.",

While I expect to wait for a table anywhere on a Saturday, my issue with this setup is that there's really nowhere to wait and there's no system for signing up for tables, etc., so you're really left staring down a table to jump at the chance when it's vacant, and risk pissing someone else off that's been waiting just as long as you. It feels like a chaotic cafeteria. The food as I've experienced it is fine. I sort of enjoyed my toast but at $14 for two toasts, I think my dollars would be better off spent down the street at Gaucho to be honest.  Kudos for the concept.

The central bar is beautiful with a coffee bar/station at the end. The lights, brick, tables and little details all just come together to make you want to hang out and try everything.   I will say, that the food selection is ... Different. Out of the four restaurant options I'd say I was drawn to Provisions the most. They had a lot of gluten free options and I had their fries which were laying on pureed squash and covered in Lentils and sour cream. Also I had their chicken tostadas. Both very flavorful and delicious. I wouldn't say however that i'd rush back for any of the food in particular. I'm looking forward to going back for the good drink selection and the atmosphere.   I'm excited to see such a cool, new idea implemented in the city for another fun dining option.",

Not that money should be a factor when you get amazing food and get to enjoy it in a dope setting.",

I hear they are staggering future rotations to prevent massive shell shock to patrons which I think is a great idea.",

    "text": "Update since they tried to delete my original post! This is a legit review as the venue is just as important as the vendors - it's about your ENTIRE meal experience - service and the food.  If you can even get inside to a vendor you might be happy: however we tried 3x and left 2 out of 3!  We tried to get a table at 6:30p on a Saturday night, I took my partner for his birthday, they had a wedding party blocking off 90% of their seating - very obnoxious - especially when I am 9mos pregnant and have to sit. really though, who doesn't want to sit and eat their food?! That's the point, this isn't a to-go joint.  Basically the success of the three tries - you have to go on a weekday just before closing - as we finally did yesterday - a Tuesday night we figured couldn't go wrong. Food is good, but still the service of the staff sucks-  kicking us out of the dining room yet again as we were eating because they were closing it, we were forced to move to the bar stools.  Pizza was good, too much bread - it's like a double Sicilian, it's overwhelming.  All the food vendors were great, and really nice and the food was overall pretty, they try hard to please.  Pupusas are a treat in pittsburgh, haven't seen one since I lived In California - these were modified to be more \"trendy\" but still very good. That was our fav thing out of the many items we tried.  The venue stinks, hence the 1star review - the vendors are great and pull it up to a 2 star for that alone.  Also watch the hours - yelp posts hours, but there are kitchen hours and bar hours- if you're a late night eater you'll be upset you can't eat in the 2hr window they show the place open!",

It's a really awesome way to try out new food and cuisine that doesn't break the bank.  I love the laidback atmosphere.  Last week I had this amazing carrot butternut soup (I think that's what it was called!) and bread for $7. My friend's ordered heftier meals and we were all satisfied.  I like that ability to get what you want and not be tied down to a specific menu.  I've been here twice and food has been excellent both times.  Friends got different assortments of items and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Definitely give it a try!",

I had the pork belly ramen from Aubergine, which was absolutely flavorful. Everything was fresh. I chugged the broth down at the end. It was that good.  My spouse got the ham and eggs from Provisions. The ham was carmelized and thick. I believe it was the best I'd ever tasted. We also shared a pudding for dessert. The little crunchier on the whipped cream were evenly split between bites so we could savor their autumn like taste.  I'm giving the galley 4 stars because it took some time to figure out how to order, are there servers, is there a drink menu, what the heck do we do here environment. But we will be back now that we sort of get it.",

There are about a dozen drafts on tap of which almost all are local and craft. There are options from Hop Farm, Grist House, the Brew Gentlemen and more. There were some breweries from outside the Pittsburgh area, but the only brewery on tap that was out of Pennsylvania was Fat Head's.",

I had the ginger gnocchi ($15), which was served with fresh tatsoi and  crispy kale over a savory bed of spiced pureed winter squash. I found myself rubbing the tatsoi into the squash with my fork to swipe up every last bit of its bright orange goodness. I have to say, it was quite a savory, rich vegetarian meal, but it wasn't a huge amount of food. I was glad to have ordered the golden tea ($4) as well, as its turmeric-black peppercorn-almond milk-coconut oil goodness helped fill me up enough to make it to dinner.   Service was reasonably quick, and the ambiance was rustic and casual. While I ate, I saw two guys from a local brewery come in with some wares for the bar staff to sample. People seemed to be enjoying the wares featured on the long beer list, too! Would for sure go back.",

Pepperoni had a little heat and was the perfect amount of greasy but crunchy on the edges as well. Cheese was flavorful and perfectly melted but not stringy while you're trying to pull the piece away from your mouth. I am seriously craving more of this pizza, and I'm normally a thin crust only type of gal.   The pie was a bit more expensive than your corner pizza shop, but it's obvious why from the quality of the ingredients. You can just taste a big difference, especially in sauce and cheese. Also, one pie was definitely enough for me and my gal pal, thought two people with a larger appetite should maybe go for something else along with this.",

All were great.   Fast forward to 2018 and Provision has advance to Federal Galley (definitely worth checking out) and the new options include:   Iron Born Pizza: THE BRUNCH PIE IS TO DIE FOR!! This place offers Michigan style pizza which I didn't know what that was but now it's all I ever want!   Banhmilicious: Pittsburgh needed more Vietnamese options and this place delivers. The Banh mi on the brunch menu is AMAZING but everything has been great.   Colonia: Brazilian food which I would be lying if I said I tried. I've heard nothing but rave reviews however they do run out of some menu offerings early :/   Brunoise: Did I just become a kid again? Cinnamon Toast Crunch Macarons!? & I've heard from a very reliable source the best burger in the burgh!   So why just 4 stars? They layout is a little cramped but much improved with Federal Galley! Additionally they offer a bar and coffee shop which is awesome but I think the coffee shop detracts from the chefs offerings since some of them have coffee drinks and the baristas can be a little... rude.   If you're reading this though call that Uber & get to smallman ASAP!!",

Most recently, I had the pork Bah MI sandwich with fries and it was good. A coworker had fresh pasta that was also good. They have artisan burgers, as well as octopus and clams.

Iron Born has become a staple for me.  I will order Grubhub Iron Born, I will go pick up a pie to go, I will go eat there.  I love love love their pizza.  I prefer it over most places and will order it if the moment works out.  Right now the favorite Fun Guy pizza.  Get it - you won't regret it.  I finally tried Home this past weekend for brunch.  (I did alot of brunching this weekend at the galleys).  I never get omelets when I eat out.  I just don't.  I've never been a fan of omelets.  However, today was the exception.  I got a short rib, cheese and mushroom omelet with an arugela salad.  Best plan I have made in awhile.    A few weeks ago I got to try Joeys Snack shop and got the tostada.  I think it was a special at the time.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FIt.was.so&s=1d3c1cd52b2a448c479fea30417092738025afa56773fa8e2b4f4f6724902e11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">It.was.so</a>.good.    All in all - you still can't go wrong at Smallman Galley.  The food, the drinks, you can find something for everyone.",

    "text": "Okay, so we accidentally stumbled upon Smallman Galley after a few wineries on a Saturday evening. We were starving and eager to pick the nearest restaurant due to the cold evening.   Upon entering we had NO IDEA what we were in for. We did not know that it was a \"cafeteria style\" restaurant and felt lost in the sea of regular customers. The perks of this setup were the variety of options to pick from (pizza shop, Asian food, comfort food, etc), the quick preparation and delivery of the food, and the lively atmosphere. However, there were several disadvantages as well. First of all, finding a seat was like playing an aggressive game of musical chairs. There were so many people standing around waiting for seats, so you pretty much had to jump on a seat as soon as you saw an opening. I felt like this really made the people eating feel rushed. Another disadvantage would be the chaos surrounding the bar. It was PACKED about 4 people deep all around, and it was nearly impossible to buy a drink. I ended up deciding to just drink water!   Although it was chaotic the pizza made everything totally worth it! We got the spicy deep dish pie and it was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had! The banana peppers were perfectly cooked and the honey hot sauce drizzled on top was the perfect addition to the already scrumptious pizza. It was an expensive pizza ($17), but I can honestly say it was worth every penny.   I would love to try Smallman Galley again, but I would make sure to never return on a Saturday night!",

I've found seating always a bit tight but mainly because it's crowded in a good way, that is to say, popular and bustling.",

    "text": "At the \"Home\" restaurant in the Galley, ordered the House burger and fries. Great ingredients...the bibb lettuce, tomato jam and truffled onions, with quality ground beef. Odd that the burger patty was almost round, as tall as wide and didn't fill up but half of the bun. Usually places that have burgers as their forte, form a better patty.  The bar was a whole other story, for the worse. The female bartender seemed very perturbed and smart-alecky when asked which of the craft beers were served in something smaller than a pint glass. Anyone knows that there are no standards or regs which dictate the size glass a bar uses to pour a beer. Realizing that an individual establishment makes those choices based on cost, ABV, etc., a bar should note the size they choose to serve a given beer in, or if asked, at least not be upset to be asked to clarify it. The bartender also never even came back to ask if my friend and I wanted another drink, or if we wanted the check. Instead she continued to chat with guests for 15-20 minutes or so farther down the bar. Unfortunately the male bartender seemed attentive to his customers and was congenial to all but too bad for him to share tips with the female bartender.",

    "text": "This place is basically a small scale food hall with four rotating vendors. It's brilliant! You get the variety of four menus to choose from and the fact that vendors change frequently makes every visit a new experience. As an added bonus, this set up seems like a cool way to help aspiring chefs get started without investing a lot in a restaurant space or kitchen equipment.   They also have a large bar, which is focused on craft beer. They had the best selection of craft IPAs on tap that I have ever seen.   The food booths and bar are in one main room, but there is a separate dining room as well. Perfect if you're looking for a quieter night. Lots of big tables for large groups.   Prices were higher than I expected, given the casual atmosphere and low key menu options. You'll probably spend $15-$20 on food alone.   When I was there, the four vendors included: pizza, banh mi, comfort food classics, and Asian style bowls. Though I was happy with the variety, the lack of vegetarian options was really surprising and disappointing. I'm not sure how the menus are set, but I would like to see the management require each chef to offer at least one vegetarian/special diet friendly option.   All in all, I love the concept of this food venue. Fantastic crowd pleaser, great place to take visiting friends or family.",

(Be jealous)The concept of Smallman is so unique in the fact that restaurants compliment each other so well! With the current restaurants, we tend to follow the same trend (or something similar because menus are always changing) Typically we will start at Iron Born Pizza (the best Za you will ever have), then head to HomePGH for their salad, you know to balance out our carb overload, then over to Joey's Snack Bar for a side of fries and of course ending with BMlicious and their Summer Rolls!!! You cannot go wrong, BUT be careful, once you have it one time, you won't want to go anywhere else I have also posted some pictures of past and present meals!!! All devine!!   Smallman also has hidden gems like hosting special events with their chefs, hosting spot for Common Place Coffee, their full bar, and also the Anchor Bar, located in the dinning area! They also are by far our favorite brunch spot, and have a really good seating area that is a private dinning room! Hope you enjoy!!!!",

We tried 4/5 tacos and each one was full of flavor and goodness. I enjoy going to different taco places around the city. If you do too, make sure you put Baco on your list!",

Communal seating throughout and separate dining room area in the back. I would say that you could leave the kids at home, but there's too much good food to enjoy with them.",

Today was my first visit to the new concepts (which tend to rotate in June), so I was excited to try out some new food for brunch.  I ordered the Salmon Plate from Joey's Snack Bar. The plate consisted of salmon, a fresh and lightly dressed salad, a perfectly hard boiled egg with a wet yolk, and herb cream cheese spread. It arrived with bread that was reminiscent of an everything bagel. The whole bite was absolutely delicious when I spread some of the cream cheese on the \"bagel\", topped with salmon, a bit of the egg, and some of the salad. It was the perfect brunch dish.  I also grabbed a bloody mary from the bar. I wasn't the biggest fan of the drink because it tasted very vinegar heavy with a lot of horseradish but not a lot of other complex flavors that are present in an excellent bloody mary. Oh well, I still drank the whole thing--my palate is not that discerning.  I will definitely be stopping by Joey's again, and I can't wait to try out Home as well!",

There are multiple ways to enter. Seating is first come first serve. When you get inside, there are multiple rooms (the dinning room is the best because it's more open, it's cooler, and a lot brighter than any other room). There's a coffee bar, an actual bar, and ~6-7 places to order food. We went during brunch, so the food locations had a couple different items not on the normal menu. We got loaded fries, tater tots, Mac and cheese, lobster avocado toast, and a couple drinks. Our overall experience was good! The room with all the stoves/grills was the absolute hottest! We were dripping sweat trying to decide what to eat. There were plates, silverware, napkins, and salt/pepper in the dinning room. When you order food, they give you a number and they run the food over to you. There are water crafts and glasses on every table for you to drink. When you're done, they bus your table for the next guest! In conclusion, I suggest coming here if you're in the area! The food was worth it.",

I think in part to having to walk a little further for parking.   Anyways, I've been dying to go try the new restaurants in Smallman (Joey's Snack Bar & HOME PGH) and get some the good pizza from Iron Born.   Another pro tip: get a table first and then order what you want. It will give you the opportunity to get all the foods to try. They have 4 unique restaurants to try!   Last night, I ordered the Forager pie from Iron Born - it's amazinggg! I also ordered the weekly special Gabagool sandwich 'fresh mozzarella iron born red sauce, hot capicola, salami, and their fried chicken sandwich! It was very good!   My friend ordered the Rise & Shine fried chicken sandwich! It had sausage gravy, American cheese, a dippy egg, and maple dijonaise on it. She enjoyed it very much.   We also split HOME's TV dinner. Pulled pork, Mac & cheese, fried green tomatoes, mixed vegetables, and a biscuit. I've been dying to it and it was delicious!   HOME also let us try their Nutella cheesecake dessert in a jar. It was very good! It was something totally different than I had before.   Unfortunately, there was nothing at Joey's that I wanted to try, so I'll be back again soon.",

    "text": "I love this place! Great food and drinks. It's 5 resurants and a bar.   The bar is where I start. If you want a finely made handcrafted cocktail this is the place for you. I suggest the Boston Sour as it is my favorite drink to have here.  Iron born pizza should be on a best of Pittsburgh list. Deep dish pizza crunchy, chewy delicious crust. Innovative toppings and sauce options. The mushroom pie is my favorite. The main problem with Iron born is that it's soooo good it's hard to pick an offering from the other options.  The next restaurant is Colonia, with a menu of dishes from Latin America. I have had the Pupusas, stuffed corn tortillas topped with slaw. It was better than the Pupusas I've had in other restaurants. I hope to try their other options soon.  Banhmilicious is a Vietnamese restaurant that has a beautiful bone broth. I could drink it by the glass. They have pho and banh mi also.  Brunoise is a French option I have not tried but the risotto looked really good.",

    "text": "mm mm mmmmm. Excuse me as I scarf down this entire box of pizza, as there will be absolutely no sharing. Hand Forged, and all mine.   I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the City of Detroit in its entirety, as I previously dismissed your pizza as a gimmick, or even n imitation Chicago deep dish. I know...fighting words. But Detroit style pizza, really?! Apparently yes really! By way of Pittsburgh.   Smallman Galley has been on my radar for quite some time now. The four restaurant open concept is pretty cool if I must say. Out of the four, Hand Forged easily topped my wish list; I mean it's not often you run into this style of pizza.   The two sauce pie is perfect for undecideds like myself: half white, half red. And feeling extra fancy, I opt to add pepperoni to the red side. After one bite, I float into pizza heaven. Red sauce, oven crispified pepperoni, creamy white sauce, mounds of cheese, and fennel sausage(you can put that stuff on anything and id eat it). This is nothing like a Chicago deep dish! The chewy crust makes all the difference. And with the oven browning the edges, you get both chewy and crispy crust in one bite. Like I previously stated...pizza heaven.   Pittsburgh is legit one of the most underrated culinarily destinations in the country in my humble opinion. Never disappoints. Add Hand Forged Pizza to the list of greats. As for the other three restaurants at Smallman, as long as this pizza is within arms length, I might never get around to its neighbors...like ever.   By the way, for anyone wondering which is better, red or white? Well that's easy. The winner is....me. For having consumed both.",

    "text": "This is one of the most fun and interesting restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The chefs each take such pride in their menus and the staff works hard to make sure everyone gets food quickly and understands the concept.  We walked in and took a seat at the long table near the bar, where the incredibly friendly and kind general manager, Geoff, came over at  our invitation to talk about the concept.  Chefs were brought in from all over the country to compete for the opportunity to open a first restaurant in this space with full support of the creators/owners (former military) - a True food incubator in the ever-growing Pittsburgh tech scene!  The chefs stay for 18 months and then have the opportunity to move on to their own businesses. This format means that every single thing they do is great because each chef is so invested in putting his or her best food forward.  After we had a few drinks and some amazing local beers, we switched tables to one of the many in the back, where amazing art hung on the walls.  We walked up to the counters and placed our orders, were given a number for our table, and our food arrived. We ordered from each of the four restaurants and loved everything!  We plan to go back before the chefs change later this year - there are just so many great choices in this lively and fun spot!!  Thank you!!!  Awesome idea!",

    "text": "I hate to write this review, because I love the idea of Smallman Galley. But there is no way to give immediate feedback to the restaurants, so how do they know if they are actually doing a good job. Get some feedback cards on the table, it would be a great part of the \"trial launch\" concept. Then, I don't have to out you here in public. Carota Cafe's \"Chicken Hash - sweet potato, fingerlings, leek, sage, pulled chicken, soft poached egg\" was a mess. Yes, it'a a hash, but the sweet potatoes were soft like butter while the fingerlings were cooked perfectly. Nothing was crusted, just seemed re-heated. No sage flavor, the whole hash seemed premixed and the parts were indistinguishable. Finally the entire dish - including the lovely poached egg - was topped with a LOT of red pepper flake. Why? Nothing about spicy was on the menu, and if there was sage, it was overwhelmed by the red pepper. I'm OK with some heat, but not with my coffee! On the plus side - the chocolate babka was excellent and the morning bowl perfect for our super health conscious friend.",

Each of the four restaurants (chefs) are there for 18 months, after which time, they will move on to (hopefully) open their own place and four new chefs will replace them. We ordered dishes from three of the four restaurants, sat at the long table in the bar area and received a text when each dish was ready.  All of the beer served is brewed and bottled in Pittsburgh (except for Straub and Yuengling).  They even have an espresso bar where we picked up some lattes to go.  I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!!  A great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene.",

Also loved that water was on all of the tables, though we needed a refill.

We ordered the roasted squash (which was more a salad with the squash delicately spread on the plate with the salad and fixings on top) and the roasted olives from Provision, as well as the sundae for dessert (a perfect salty-sweet combination). And we got the fresh pasta and then chicken and dumplings dishes from Aubergine. The bar had wonderful selections for beer on tap, wine and creative cocktails. All in all, the wait was not long either. I love the concept of ordering and waiting to receive a text when your food was ready as well as being able to sit where ever you chose.

I had the pork roast hash from Colonia and my husband had a steak dish (it was delicious - although he couldn't remember the name of it). Savory breakfast usually isn't my jam, but this was amazing. Mike came with roasted yams and an egg on top - perfection!  The coffee - oh man, the coffee! I had a pour over from Commonplace coffee and it was heavenly. So smooth and full bodied - a perfect compliment to my breakfast!  There is something for everyone on the brunch menu -  and Iron Born pizza? Yes please. I sampled their fare at a Yelp event a few months back - and normally I'm not a pizza for brunch person, but exceptions must be made. Their pizza is so crisp, flavorful and just all around amazing.  The atmosphere at the Galley is fantastic - I do recommend arriving early for brunch if you have a larger party. Seating is first come first serve - and there are high chairs, so families with young children aren't excluded. (We took our 5 month old - he enjoyed looking at the ceiling fans and the neat light fixtures!).  Whether it's morning, noon or night - stop by the Smallman Galley. They have something sure to appeal to everyone -oh, AND a bar .",

    "text": "First off I must say hats off to the owners of Smallman Galley! What a genius concept for a restaurant! I've eaten at Smallman Galley twice now and totally love this place. The atmosphere & restaurant decor is spot on.  I ordered food from 3 of the different restaurants within Smallman Galley and I was completely pleased with everything I ordered. I can't really choose a favorite one because all their food is so different from each other.  But I will say I think my favorite dish is the cottage cheese toast from Toast.  Each restaurant had a very creative and unique menu. Their food presentation was done very well and thought out. Any one of these restaurants will do just fine with their own brick and mortar location.  With 4 different restaurants Smallman Galley will definitely have something for everybody. And excited to see what 4 new restaurants go in next.",

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea and enjoyed my food but my overall experience detracted from enjoying those things. The atmosphere was very overwhelming which made it unenjoyable and rather stressful - I would be interested to see if the experience on a weeknight would be different but nonetheless it detracted from my experience on Saturday night. There wasn't any clear direction on how everything worked other than watching other people and we awkwardly took our dishes up to the bussing station because no one had come by to clear the table. I think that the concept of the restaurant is great and I love the idea, but the execution was disappointing for me. In terms of the food, we had the Iron Born red pizza which was good but not life-changing. The quality of the food and speed at which it was brought out was great. Now that I've been there, I would like to try some of the other stalls but I won't be rushing to return soon.",

You go to the different restaurant counters to order & then find a place to sit. The waiter will deliver the food to your table based on your order number.   I ordered a chicken sandwich from the restaurant closest to the bottom entrance (sorry, forgot the name of restaurant). The sandwich was the perfect amount of spicy. The chicken breast was juicy and came in a large portion.   Would recommend to any party who are finding a place to eat in Pittsburgh",

    "text": "What a cool concept! We found out about Smallman Galley through an internet search for a new place to try. I came here with my husband and my mom last weekend.   The seating area is kind of like a cafeteria, there are plates and utensils at stations and you pick your own seat. All four restaurants are right next to each other, and directly across from them are the coffee shop and bar.   We read the menu at each place, and we settled on an appetizer of fried pretzel bites from Sultry to start. They were just the right amount of crispy, hot, and not too salty! Loved them. Loved the cheese sauce they came with too.   My mom and I decided to split the sausage Alfredo rigatoni from Mangiamo, and it was incredible. A huge portion that even her and I couldn't split (my husband finished it off!). The sauce was really creamy but not too thick. I was a little disappointed they omitted the mushrooms, but my mom was pleased because she doesn't like mushrooms and didn't want to pick around them! The sausage was delicious as well.   My husband had Not Your Grandmas's Tacos at Ba-co, which were Nashville hot chicken tacos. They were very tasty (I tried a couple of bites!), but he said he wishes you got a little bit more substance for the price tag. Each taco had one small chicken tender strip on it (one was half the size of the other). He said he also thinks it should've come with a side of rice or something similar.   We did order a cocktail from the bar, it was the featured charity one. Not much flavor other than the vodka (even though there were a number of other ingredients listed on the menu). The bartender was super nice and helpful!  Overall, we are super psyched to come back and maybe try brunch!",

My friend got a flat bread at one of the neighboring restaurants and the flavor was good but it was surprisingly so small! We were both hoping Iron Born Pizza would be there, but they are not anymore.   The service was fine! It is a unique idea where you walk into a large room with multiple restaurants inside. You order from whichever one and seat yourself. Then, they bring your meal over! I am definitely coming back and trying something else next time!",

    "text": "Smallman Galley was a neat experience.  I was initially confused when certain 'restaurants' came up in searches around the area that I did not understand were one and the same with \"Smallman Galley,\" but it makes enough sense once you know what it is.  Iron Born, Ba-Co, Banhmilicious, and Home are each their own 'stand' in the Galley and there is a separate bar.  Seating is communal for the most part with a couple very long table arrangements and some smaller tables around the edges.  Still water was set out at the tables with glasses, all other beverages need to be ordered at the bar, unless a specialty item specific to a stand, like Thai Tea from Banhmilicious.   The menus for each stand are limited because they are small kitchens, but if you want to have the variety of choice, having four different cuisine options under one roof gives the flexibility of a food court with the quality of a sit down restaurant.  I would say the menus are on the pricey side for what it is, but it is good quality if not a good 'value'.  I tried items off the brunch menu from Home.  The BLT was delicious and surprisingly filling. I also tried their home fries, perfectly cooked, but very glad I ordered the 'house sauce' on the side.  The potatoes were definitely enhanced by the flavor, but it is very spicy and might overwhelm some taste-buds, so it's nice to be able to control how much you have in each bite.  My boyfriend had Thai Tea and the Avocado & Honey Banh Mi off the brunch menu from Banhmilicious.  He readily enjoyed them both :)   We had no trouble getting seating on a rainy Sunday around 1 pm, but I could see this being a real gamble on weekend evenings if you are trying to seat more than 2 people together. With that in mind though, it should be a good experience for a group as well.",

First of all, we loved that we could all try something different and didn't have to think of a type of food that we were all in the mood for. I tried the Smoked Salmon Poke at Bahnmilicious and it was amazing! The portion size was very generous and the various flavors/ingredients blended together perfectly. The food came out super fast as well.  One thing I am not a fan of is that it can be hard to get a seat. We came on a Thursday evening at 7pm and a lot of the dining seats were full as the tables are set up communal style seat yourself. We ended up sitting in the bar area and it does tend to get loud in there. Drinks ended up being on the pricier side as well (i.e. my cocktail was $12). Other than that, great place to check out. Can't wait to try brunch next time!",

I have paid extra to attend special events promoting the incubator chefs. I have spoken personally to incubator chefs providing personal, private criticism. I have always tipped the bartenders very well.    Tonight I was treated extremely rudely by both the bartender and the bar back. In the past, this particular bartender has brushed me off rudely when I have tried to place an order at an extremely busy bar. I am a 5'1\" tall woman so it is normal that I am overlooked at a busy bar so I hold my glass above my head to be seen. This bartender has routinely told me to wait my turn as if I am somehow being rude by trying to be seen. A simple, \"I see you\" would be fine.   Tonight, I told the bar back I would like another beer. She rudely said that was not her job, the bartender would wait on me. She never passed my request on to the bartender that I could tell from my place sitting at the bar. My friend asked after 10-15 minutes if I had received my beer and I rudely commented that the bar back (expletive deleted) had not passed my request on to the bartender. I was promptly instructed to leave and that I would not be welcome back. Fine with me. I was not drunk. I had ridden my bike there, had two beers and dinner. No problem in not returning. I think the problem may be that these millennials don't realize that I am a very short woman accustomed to being overlooked so I have learned to compensate. I'm 60 years old. I was with two friends in their 70's who were appalled at how I was treated. I'm done with Smallman Galley.  By the way, only 18 of my over 500 reviews are one star.",

    "text": "I love the concept of Smallman Galley. My boyfriend and I ate there for dinner on a Friday evening after a walk through the Strip District. There were many great options, so it was tough to choose. We wound up going with Home's Quack n Cheese (mac n cheese with duck in it!) and Bahnmilicious's tuna poke, which had some truffle oil.   My feedback to these chefs:   The Quack n Cheese was beautifully presented and the first few bites were heavenly; however, after the third bite, it started to taste very over salted and as a whole the dish was too rich to eat very much of. I would say to use much less salt and to find a way for the dish to be lighter.  The tuna poke was pretty good, though nothing too innovative. Coming from Washington DC, I have had fast-casual poke that was far better and more interesting than this dish. There are other toppings that would be brought into the mix to make it better. It might be useful for this potential restauranteur to try out the mitsubi concept there - this is Hawaiian street food, lightly fried chunks of rice with a sheet of nori and other fun topics (e.g. spam). This is more unique and looks great pictures (which can be important when trying to get your craft out there on social media!).  Overall, the concept was fun. We just were not blown away by the dishes we happened to pick. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "There are changes in the Galley again and I'm on top of them. Smallman Galley continues to excel with their chefs in training with 4 concept restaurants. While Home, Banhmilicious, and Iron Born are still there this review will focus on the \"pop up\" concept known as Crumb. For more information on the other 3 please refer to my previous reviews.  Crumb is the Galley's first all vegan restaurant. It is run by Chef Abigail who founded the vegan donut. She is also from Relish. I had the opportunity to interview her and learned that she will only be there for one month. She has no idea where her business will go afterwards.  The menu hosts interesting vegan concepts such as shrimp po boy and vegan donut ice cream sandwiches. The jackfruit burger is one of her specialties if you like that type of melon.  I decided to go with their garden burger and side salad. You can opt for vegan fries if you don't want the salad.  The ordering remains the same. Pay then you are given a number to take and you can sit anywhere. I sat down in the wide open area facing Smallman St and noticed that they have now put a small bar off to the back of this area. Their main bar and coffeeshop is still on 21st St entrance side.  I was truly amazed at the size of my sandwich and salad! Topped with everything you'd expect in a burger it was served on a baguette and was so good! A bit messy too! But they have plenty of napkins and utensils nearby so you can help yourself. Thinking I would be full from the lunch I wanted to try the ice cream sandwich donut but learned she wouldn't be getting them in until later this pm. I settled for a regular one instead.   Again the donut was very good and not as filling as I would expect. I really enjoyed it. Crumb is anything but crumbs considering with the generous portions you get with a meal.   A vegan concept is wonderful to have in the Galley and is a welcome addition to a city that doesn't have a lot of all vegan restaurants. Whether you are vegan or not it is truly worth the experience.   Crumb occupies the space formerly held by Joey's snack bar. In Jan 2019 Crumb will be replaced with Ba-Co a street taco concept with a barbecue twist. It will be run by chef Tim D. with a more upscale type menu.",

It was a bit sweeter than I expected but I loved the runny egg and the gravy! It's also a lot of pizza; I took home half in a to go box.   Also great tres leche cake-good flavor, and I liked the whipped cream and dulce de leche on the side. For $8 I wish there was a bit more, but such is going to places like this I guess. From trying my friends dessert, Ba-co's hot chocolate isn't bad but it's not as good as the tres leche cake.",

Before arriving I was pretty set on getting Iron Born but decided to try something different since I always get the Detroit style pizza at Federal Galley.  I ended up getting Pho from Banhmiliciois. It was definitely a lot spicier than I anticipated and I eat plenty of spicy foods. I definitely wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice. Other than that I think the soup was full of flavor and it was a very generous portion.   The only reason I can't bump this place up for a 4 star is because of the overall setup. There just isn't enough seating and it feels so tight. I felt like people were bumping me constantly as they walked by. I wish it were a little bigger and more open.",

I think the best way to describe this experience was \"cafeteria style.\" We claimed our tables, and went off on our own exploring the different types of food offered here. I ended up going with Iron Born - a pizza place.  We reconvened at our adult cafeteria tables and tasted our Yinzer pie & Lovers pie. The taste was alright, although I'm not super picky with pizza so this just tasted like a fancier high-end pizza to me. I liked that there were unique options you probably can't get at your local Domino's or Papa John's, but it was very pricey (~$17 for one personal pie) for the size & ingredients. It was mostly a lot of bread with a thin layer of toppings & sauce.   However, I don't want to give this place only 3 stars because my friends seemed to enjoy the food from other stands and the atmosphere was lively. It may be hard to find seating, but if our group of 15 people can do it, I believe you can too!   Come for a nice, unique experience to sharing food \"family style\" in the Strip District. But don't set your expectations toooo high.",

Needed crowd control and muliple stations set up.  No light snacks provided and restaurants stopped cooking at 10 pm on New Year's Eve.  They knew how many tickets were sold, but didn't have a way to provide everyone with expected samples of beer.  Will try the food at a less crazy time.",

    "text": "Super innovative way to overcome the issues of the food truck industry. The space has a gastropub vibe and a large room dedicated to sit down dining as well as another room for community tables and a large antique bar. There are four chef stations allowing you to choose dishes from a variety of artfully crafted dishes without leaving the single enclosed establishment. Simply leave your name and number with the chef station and they will text you when your food is ready. The bar has craft cocktails created by each chef to match their individual dishes. Bit of expert advice, although its an exciting concept don't feel obligated to try everything. Some stuff is more palatable and other is just too adventurous for everyone. Thats ok! Find one thing you like it's not tapas dining! The best part is the entire place works as an incubator so the better a single chef does within the 8 weeks they set up shop the more likely they are to get help from the organization to start a restaurant. WELCOME TO FOODIE HEAVIN.  I can't wait to see how this impacts the community. Go out and support, home townies, out of townies, doesn't matter! Just go!",

I looked at all four stations and settled on the second station. I ordered from that and decided to give the first station a try. That guy was distracted by holding his baby and never even acknowledged me after standing there a while. And no offense, I am a mother who struggled through the 'balancing family and work' years. I decided I would come back and try something for dessert. When I went back the guy was really pre-occupied with whatever he was doing (looking through containers general kitchen stuff.). I felt I was making enough of a presence but after standing around for a while I just decided to leave. Maybe I shouldn't expect the chefs to have great customer service skills, but in honesty this did affect how I viewed my overall experience. I may give it another shot at a different time of day since what I did order from station two was delicious, and one of those meals you have to pause between each bite because the flavor is just that enjoyable.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time over the weekend after dying to check it out for months and overall had a really great experience. I love the concept - you're free to wander around, grab a drink, order in stages, move tables, etc. The space is gorgeous and everybody we spoke to was super knowledgeable about the food or drink they were preparing, which was awesome. The place was the perfect amount of busy (Friday before a long weekend probably meant it was a little emptier than normal) and all of our food was ready ~10 minutes after we ordered it.  There were four of us and without planning we all ordered something different - more to try! Tip: Definitely check out the menus online before you go - some of the chalkboards were hard to read, and seeing all of the delicious-sounding options was almost overwhelming.  Smothered Fries - Provision PGH - At first I skeptical because the ingredients sounded really weird together: lentils? peas? goat cheese? Um ok....except together it was all AMAZING. These were the most perfect, crispy fries I have ever eaten, and the toppings all magically worked. I wouldn't necessarily order these for myself, but they're perfect to share.  Pork Belly, Shrimp+Grits, Pickles - Aubergine Bistro - There was a fried softshell crab special that looked amazing but it was sold out by the time we went to order. Boo. The pork belly was beyond succulent and flavorful. The shrimp and grits were OK (the grits definitely carried the dish), but the presentation was kind of underwhelming since they were just slopped into this tiny bowl with no garnish. The pickles were a tad too salty for me but they were a nice contract to the rest of the heavier dishes.  Octopus, Horseradish Gnocchi - Carota Cafe - Far and away my favorite. The octopus was tender and charred perfectly, and even swayed the seafood hater at our table! The potatoes and chimichurri were a little over-salted, but it didn't detract overall from the dish (more of a personal preference). I wish the gnocchi had been even heavier on the horseradish, but again, another personal preference. And the presentation blew everybody else out of the water - I wish I could have captured it in photos, but there were edible flowers!  At this point we were stuffed but realized we hadn't ordered anything from Josephine's Toast. TBH most of the dishes there seemed kind of underwhelming, but her dessert menu seemed on point so we gave the strawberry-rhubarb \"cake toast\" a shot. My expectations were low (I'm not usually a sweets person) but this was the perfect way to end the dinner - light, not too sugary, and perfect to share.  The only drawbacks from our experience and the reason I'm not giving 5 stars: 1. The drinks are REALLY expensive for what they are. I get that they're using local liquor and top-shelf brands, but $10-12 a cocktail (or glass of wine) adds up quickly. The bartender did mention they have a good happy hour special, unfortunately I'm never around the area during that time.  2. While the space doesn't have traditional servers, they did have two busboys on duty and honestly could have used at least one more. Tables nearby were left piled with dirty dishes throughout our entire meal, and we also had trouble flagging somebody down to refill our water bottle (we stole another from a nearby table but that didn't seem like a reasonable solution). Stuff happens and for all I know maybe they were short-staffed that night, but this was the one aspect of the night that left me kind of going \"hmmmm.\" Reading other reviews it seems like it's an ongoing problem - it was relatively slow the night we were there, so I can't imagine what it must be like when it's busy.  Overall a really fun and interesting night out, and remarkably relaxing considering it was a lot of restaurant DIY. There were dishes at each place I can't wait to go back and try....not to mention brunch!",

For those who don't know, this joint is a cooking experiment of sorts for new or not-as-well-known chefs to get a place to advertise their restaurant concepts with 18-month stints. As such, I decided to go one day and try this place. Currently, there are four restaurants nested within this place: Aubergine Bistro (mixed cuisines), Carota Cafe (veggies-inspired), Josephine's Toast (breakfast-based), and Provision Pgh Food + Drink (meat + global-inspired cuisine). If you're interested in learning more about what each place is about and what their menu lineup is, I suggest you Google Smallman Galley and see what this place is all about. In terms of how it works, just like going to any other restaurant. You pick a certain one (or however many you like to try), order and pay at the register. The eating area is cafeteria-style that is located in the back past the four restaurant concepts. If you're eating in, I believe they bring your food to you when it's ready. In general, you can't really go wrong with any of these places and it's a great way to support those who are up and coming in the food scene. Go check this place out!",

Order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. The downsides being you have to go to one place for your entree, another for your coffee, and a third for your Bloody Mary. And pay separately. The other thing is if you order from different places from your companions the food will come out at different times and you may find yourself drooling while they eat!",

I liked how inexpensive Mackerel was.  Eating mainly fish, usually when I go out to eat it seems like I'm paying a premium.  Pricing wise it stood along with everything else on the menu.  The fish itself was very well portioned, cooked and seasoned just right: nice and crispy on the outside and just heavenly on the inside.  It was paired with Carolina rice and snap peas.  It reminded me of a dish you could get from a Puerto Rican neighborhood in New York.  The egg salad was really rich and super filling.  I'm also glad that they didn't overdo it with the anchovies.  So that made them a nice touch.  You definitely get a decent portion of egg salad so it's absolutely worth sharing.  We also were lucky enough to come during happy hour which only means one thing...half off drinks! The bar is this beautifully slated bronze and the bartenders and incredible: they really know their stuff and put their time and care into your drink by tasting the larger batch before pouring a glass.  I'm glad we came at the time that we did because the chef said he was expecting it to be incredibly busy tonight.",

Not sure what I'm talking about? Well, these four chefs have 18 months to make it or break it. Once those 18 months are up, hopefully they will have built their biz enough so that they can have their own brick and mortar restaurant.  Honestly, I don't know how any of the four wouldn't have a great chance with the excellent food I've tried. And believe, I've tried them all!  Provision's gastro pub style burger and double fried fries are incredible. I love the vegetable forward vibe of Carota Cafe and will have dreams about their squash grilled cheese. Aubergine rocked my world with a fried rice dish and local maple glazed ham. Finally, Josephine's Toast is everything you want in bread, plus delicious additions, like mussels in a tasty broth you can dip your toast in!  Haven't convinced you already to head there? Well then belly up to the bar for an excellent array of cocktails (love the \"to the five boroughs\") and a great craft beer list.   It's cafeteria style and very large inside, so no need to worry about reservations or snagging a seat. Get yourself to here for a really unique experience and amazing food and drink to boot!",

We went on a very cold Saturday night right before New Years Eve.  Because of that, we were fortunate not to have to stand in line, though I suspect on a typical Saturday night there is a bit of a line and open tables are hard to find.  There are four restaurants and two bars to choose from.  We had pizza from Iron Born Pizza and it was fantastic.  Deep dish pizza done right.  The flank steak from Colonia was excellent as was the braised lamb pasta from Brunoise.  I didn't really care for the soup from Brunoise (parsnip, chestnut, & orange) but others in our party enjoyed it.  The vegetarian in our group ordered the \"divorce bowl\" from Colonia which was a rice and beans bowl with other veggies and jalapenos.  It was also excellent.  My only complaint is that neither of the bars had any beer on tap that was  of a lighter, Belgium or American Pilsner style.   I get that bitter IPAs are all the rage, but not everyone likes their beer that way.  Fortunately, the bartender was able to hook me up with a delicious Canadian whiskey I had never tried so all was not lost.  I love this concept since it allows you to try many different options and can accommodate groups where not everyone wants the same style of food.",

While not for those looking to be waited on with traditional style, after one visit you will be waiting at your table for delivery of your food with too much salivation.   The Iron Born pizza, Detroit Style, is a personal favorite.  For folks from Pittsburgh it is the slice of pizza you never knew you loved devoutly.  I have been back a few times.  I am always a little surprised at the cost...until I begin to enjoy the circus of flavors in my mouth.  It IS worth it.  The concept is worth it.  The place is brilliant and evolving and a must for locals and visitor alike.  Generally, there are 4 or 5 different mini-restaurant options from Asian to Italian to Americana and beyond.  Go for it.

    "text": "The Smallman Galley provides a place for incoming chefs to test out their menu before launching their own restaurant. The \"incubator\" concept is quite unique and since I support small businesses and aspiring chefs, I love this place. There are currently 4 chefs with 4 different menus. The food can be hits or misses, but the chefs are open to discussing about it.   -------Specifically for PROVISION------  My favorite concept when I visited was Chef Stephen's PROVISION. I was drawn to his unique fusion of flavors. The sample of banh mi with crispy chicken skin he provided was delicious. In addition, I ordered a side of loaded fries with roasted squash, lentils, goat cheese, lemon aioli and herbs. I couldn't pin point the squash though, but tasted the aioli and it suited the dish well.   Provision is definitely on the right track with the right flavors in the right proportions. I would give it 5-stars, but as a Vietnamese, I'm kind of butthurt that they misspelled \"BANH MI\". I mentioned it in person during my visit and I hope it's fixed. A menu is like a resume; it is my first impression of the establishment. It might seem like a small error, but as a consumer it's slightly off-putting and raises doubts about the quality/expertise. Other than that, great job Provision and I look forward to your full blast launch!",

The atmosphere is kind of noisy and hectic- very enjoyable, but definitely more of a casual meal out with friends than a quiet date kind of place.  It can be a little confusing on your first visit to know how things work... You order and pay separately at each kitchen and get a number card so they can bring your food out to you, seat yourself anywhere, and grab plates and flatware from the various stacks around the seating areas. :)",

    "text": "Alright...this is a bit of a mixed bag review-wise...not because there is some good and bad, but because...well...read the review.  It was my birthday...or a few days later.  A friend and I were celebrating.  Smallman Galley was on my \"list\" to try.  I didn't know what to expect.  But I think I had in my mind a vision of what this \"chef incubator\" was going to be.    Things I didn't expect:  picnic table seating, 4 \"store fronts\", people lined up ordering from the counter.  So...go into it with that expectation.  I kind of love the idea of the place, but if you were thinking to woo your lady love (or man love, whatevs) with a candle-lit dinner in a cozy restaurant with amazing service...well, you'd  miss the mark.  I had to wait.  My friend was late.  I was sitting at the bar, so I didn't really care.  I perused the menu.  First drink that popped out at me was a Primus song.  \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\" reportedly had:  Amara Sfumato Rabarbaro, Aperol, Genepy des Alpes, pluot syrup, and La Croix.    First impressions:  I don't know what any of those things are.  Not one.  Hadn't heard of them.  Hadn't had them.  Didn't know how to pronounce them.  The only word I recognized was \"syrup\".  I vaguely recalled 'des' might have meant \"of\" in friench.  Or Belgian.  Whatever.  Completely incomprehensible drink while you wait for a friend?  TAKE ALL MY MONEY!  It was really good.  Served in a tall glass with a lemon garnish, I sat and drank my fancy unpronouncably ingrediented drink in suave sophistication.  I texted a picture to my friend.  \"You're there already?\"  Yeah...because that's when we said we'd meet.    Whatever.  I finished that drink and went two lines up on the drink menu.  \"Vilified\"  This promised brown butter-washed bourbon, sage-sweet potato syrup, and black walnut bitters.  So much effort went into this drink.  Who do they get to wash the bourbon in brown butter?  How many natives died making the sage-sweet potato syrup?  And I don't even know how you make a bitter let alone a black walnut bitter.  This drink was described so pretentiously I had to lie to the bartender and tell him my name was Thurston J. Howell before he'd pour it for me.  It was great.  I would have had another.  Wait...I did have another.  I think.  Things were starting to get a little...hazy.  It had an orange garnish.  It didn't photograph well.   I texted a picture of vilified to my friend.  \"What?  You're on your second drink?\"  I was.  \"You're going to be hammered by the time I get there.\"  I was.  Whatever.  I finished that drink and and moved on to \"Cyco Vision\".  Redemption rye, Yellow Chartreuse, pistachio orgeat, lemon, cardamom bitters, egg white.  And listen...I'm a sucker for egg whites in my drink.  I can't explain why.  Rye?  Awesome.  Yellow Chartreuse?  Confusing.  Orgeat?  Let's be honest.  When I got to orgeat it sounded like orgy and I might have chuckled to myself and just ordered the drink because of the orgeat.  I don't even know what orgeat is.  But...it also reminded me of Xergiok from Adventure Time.  I had to have this drink.    I had this drink.  It was good.  It was honestly my least favorite of the three but it was good.  I took a picture...it looked like a malt.  Served in a wide goblet, It had a thick foam on top and the bartender drew a little design with ...maybe with the orgeat...I don't know.  Fancy!    I texted my friend the picture.  \"Jesus, I'm almost there, slow down!\"  I did.    And then my friend arrived and I recommended the Vilified and she hated it, so I drank hers and she took the \"Superman\" that I ordered, which was good, but I wasn't in love with it.    And then the bartender accidentally made someone another drink and it wasn't what he ordered and so she was going to dump it, but I said, \"What do you do with a drink when it's the wrong one?\" and she said, \"Dump it, unless you want it.\"  I did.  I don't even know what it was.  I think it was good. It's not completely clear.  And so now...Well now I've had five or six drinks in an hour and a half and I'm pretty much open for business, but it's time to eat, because god forbid we drink on an empty stomach.  TOO LATE!! IT WAS TOO LATE!!  But I walked past the previously-mentioned store fronts on my way to the bathroom and brought back a few ideas...  We ended up eating shrimp and grits (fairly certain this was delicious, but I have no idea which place I got it from) and poutine (again...and again).  So...I guess the mixed bag is that 1)  I really don't have a clear memory of the food.  I know it was good.  I just don't know where I got it, but 2) I have a very strong sense of the drink menu.  And it was a good drink menu.    Go for drinks!  I will be back.  What I remember of the food was that it was really good.  I know what to expect (no waitress, first come first serve seating, picnic table style).  Outstanding place to go with a group of friends and just sort of sprawl out across a picnic table and drink and try new foods.",

    "text": "Being from New York, I had been craving a concept like this one here in Pittsburgh. I was so used to having a fast-casual, counter-service environment where sharing multiple different types of food with friends was a possibility. I know, I know - you can share food anywhere. But at Smallman Galley, you can mix and match cuisines that don't often appear on the same menu at a typical establishment.  OK - I had been asking my friends to try the place for a while before they eventually obliged. I'll admit, the first visit struck an odd chord with them as they weren't used to this kind of system (ordering food at the counter separately from ordering drinks at the bar, receiving a number to wait at the table, etc.) I think a few of them left still confused as to the purpose.   I tend to enjoy the environment, though it may be a product of high familiarity with this process. The FOOD WAS AMAZING, so it all ends up worth it in the end if this process isn't really your thing. The first time I went, I got a roast that is no longer on the rotating menu at Aubergine Bistro. It was so tender it fell apart on my fork, but what really astounded me was the rice it was served with! I don't know that I've ever had better rice. I tend to frequent Josephine's Toast, as I am a sucker for a good avocado toast. They accomplish flavors with their avocado toast that I just can't accomplish at home (plus, their bacon is a home run - crispy and thick, yum!). You want tostadas? Provision has you covered! And oh man, are they good.  There is something for everyone at Smallman Galley - an ideal place to visit with a group who struggle to agree on a common food theme for a night out. And if you're thinking of brunch and coffee - let's just say, when my friend visited from Cincinnati, she deemed the latte she ordered the BEST latte she has ever had. In this day and age of trendy, so-so coffee spots, a good latte is refreshing to find.  Now that the cravings are coming back, I'm sure I'll be back very soon. I want to be sure I visit again before the chefs change over - four new chefs will be debuting this year! How exciting!",

    "text": "These guys not only have a great idea, but they are killing the execution of it. Bring in inspired and talented chefs, give them free reign of their menus and the cocktail list, build out a space that encourages community (and food envy), and let the people support the chefs and act as their guinea pigs so the chefs can hone their concept.    A few notes:   -Happy Hour is half off, so cocktails are $5 and local craft beer is ~$3.50.  -There are no servers, each stand texts you when your food is ready. As a result if you come with a group expect everyone to be popping up and down. Not a big deal, it actually gives the venue a lot of energy with everyone moving around.    After trying something from each chef I can recommend a few standouts:  - Green Chile Chicken Tostadas from Provisions (a great combo of spicy, crunchy, sour, and savory)  - Grits with Kale, Carrots, and Parsnips from Aubourgine (Honestly, this is current leader for \"Best Thing I've Eaten in 2016\". Who knew carrots and parsnips could taste so good?!)  - Avocado Toast from Josephine's Toast (they offer gluten free toast so if that's your thing don't miss this place)",

Came to the table and smelled like the B.O. of the kid you knew in 6th grade, as they transition into adulthood and don't yet wear deodorant reguarly. I just assumed I wasn't \"appreciating\" the fine cuisine of which I was being served, and decided to eat anyway.  But the smell was so bad.  I feel vindicated in my disgust knowing that they were probably spoiled and for some reason they served them anyways.  I have a feeling the head chef wasn't there at the time (it was lunch) or else he would've not allowed these to go out.  They were gritty and I honestly have no idea what happened. I honestly am willing to forgive and try another item on their menu, but it doesn't bode well that they served very obviously rancid mussels to the public.  Surprised no one got sick.  Just don't order the mussels...ever.   IronBorn was delicious and I can't wait to go back and order the white pizza.    So yeah, honestly have to give Colonia 2 stars (I don't suspect malicious intent, but the other reviews mentioning these gives me pause) and Ironborn gets 5 stars.

The thick crust was perfectly crispy and topped with a delicious garlic oil rub rather than tomato sauce (though there are fresh chopped tomatoes on top), and the ricotta cheese dollops were truly heavenly and just the right contrasting texture to the crust. Fresh arugula is sprinkled on the very top, and the combination of these tastes all together makes for a truly unique and scrumptious pizza! The seasoning and herbs used were perfect, and it seemed like there was a hint of lemon in the sauce as well, which kept me craving the next bite. I can't wait to come back and get it again before Iron Born leaves SG! Well done!!!",

Its a stall.  Up-and-coming chefs try their hand at managing their micro restaurant.  I like it because you can have completely different cuisines and options all in the same place!  Just try it!  a few tips:  ~ not a sit down and be served atmosphere.  its open seating, find a spot and make a friend ~ you order at the stall that you want, get a number, put it on your table, and they'll bring it out  ~ get your own drinks at the bar, they've got a great list  ~ someone will bus the table  ~ its noisy and I love it - adds to the overall atmosphere",

Each of these places are trying out new things to see if they could be successful one their own. They try new things and listen to the feedback from the customers and change on the fly. Each place is allowed to stay for a year and a half and then after they 4 new places come in. You have to pay separately at each place as they are all officially different businesses.  The food, amazing! There are so many different and interesting things to try. This is not a place to go if you are looking for something run of the mill, no sir. Yum! As for the bar they had a large selection of craft beer on tap as well as a fully stocked bar.  I for sure want to go back already!",

Out of the current set of emerging restaurants, I think that Iron Born is my personal favorite.

I immediately fell in love with the concept--an \"incubator\" for up and coming chefs to hone their skills and gain exposure. So cool. The staff seemed very passionate about the project, and the chefs were eager to show us the results of their hard work.  I have been there many times since. The menus often change (both for the food stands and the bar) so there are always new things to try. I love that each of the \"kitchens\" offers fairly different options. Anybody should be able to find something here that will interest them--I definitely recommend taking the time to read all four menus before making any hasty decisions!  The bar does a nice happy hour, and this is a great spot to hang out with friends after work. Being in the strip, it's a little less packed than most of the places in town. It still can get quite busy though, especially on a Friday.  I no longer live in Pittsburgh, and I definitely miss this place! I made sure to stop in a few weeks ago when I was in town visiting.",

    "text": "Plenty of seating and no wait makes Smallman Galley an ideal destination for Sunday brunch.  I guess my SO and I were in a comfort food mood with the snow falling outside, as we shared the PORK BELLY RAMEN from Aubergine Bistro and LAMB STEW from Carota Cafe.  The stew was brought to our table immediately, with the ramen following perhaps 15 minutes or so later.  We also grabbed an Americano and a Gryphon's Masala Chai tea from the coffee bar.  I'm generally a sucker for hole-in-the-wall type \"ethnic\" eateries, so it's been a while since I've treated myself to some upscale American bistro cooking, and the punch of flavors in the lamb stew fully reminded me of what I had been missing.  The rich dill-scented broth reminded me of a lovely Eastern European shchi soup (an herby sauerkraut beef broth-based soup), so aromatic and just pungent enough without being overbearing.  The lamb meat fell into toothsome strings in the soup, and the root vegetables were soft without being mushy.  The bowl came topped with a piece of garlic bread that my SO used as a vehicle for the lamby goodness into his mouth as we shared the bowl in the center of the table.  I can't muster up a single criticism for this dish.  It was absolutely lovely.  Then the ramen arrived, fragrantly wafting us with sesame oil and dressed to impress with no shortage of sliced fresh shiitake mushroom, scallions, shredded wakame, a soft-boiled egg (not too hard but not too liquidy to spill into the broth), and the sumptuous pork belly.  While each component had clearly been carefully prepped, I wished that the ingredients and the broth had just a bit more seasoning--granted, though, I tend to be a fan of very big tastes.  Mild is not my style, and that's what this broth was, as I tasted mostly the sesame and little of the pork and its fatty goodness.  The abundant belly that we kept finding large chunks of in our bowl was a beautifully soft texture, though sadly wanted for a bit more salt as well.  My fiance devoured the thin, curly noodles. While not the best ramen I've ever had, this bowl did not disappoint me, as the deliberation and care put into its composition clearly came through in taste and delivery.  It was obvious to me from my visit why Smallman Galley has been so popular in Pittsburgh--the dishes are prepared with the detail and skill of a fine dining establishment, while the vibes and prices are easy-going and non-committal.  The cafeteria-style seating and the self-service utensils are the perfect complement to the progressive menus.  These chefs deserve so much respect for growing and adapting their businesses in these tiny kitchens, but what a great opportunity it is for Pittsburgh to see and taste what they're made of.  Don't miss this.",

It's a great place to go for something new, and when your group doesn't want to stick to just one genre of food. I had the curried chicken and it was incredible. They have a great drinks selection and plenty of space for intimate meals, group parties, and family meals! Finding parking can be a bit of a chore, but that's no big surprise in Pittsburgh.

I was lucky to go with an adventurous friend because she pushed me to try dishes from multiple places and I'm so glad she did. I hate to go on and on about what we had because I know the places will be changing up soon, but I would be doing a disservice to 2 of the best dishes I've ever had if I didn't mention them!   They were the duck confit wings and Buffalo cauliflower! Omg! I literally had a dream about the cauliflower the other night. As someone who loves buffalo flavor, but not the fat and calories that always come with it, I was IN LOVE! And the duck confit wings will haunt my dreams with their perfection!

I love the concept of the chef incubator and the space is such a great addition to the Strip District!   It was early enough to grab a seat at the bar for happy hour, which by the way is awesome. Half off all drinks and wine from 5-7 pm!? I was thrilled to find a happy hour that extends past 6:00! I started with the Strictly Business cocktail and it was wonderful - a mix of Boyd & Blair, cinnamon and ginger beer. The perfect winter cocktail. I also love how each chef also has a hand in the cocktail selections for the menu.   Now onto the food. We started with the mushroom and brie toast from Josephine's Toast and it was excellent! The perfect amount of melted brie and various mushrooms. Then we shared both the beef and pork meatballs and the fresh pasta from Aubergine. Both were phenomenal. The pasta had root vegetables tossed with pesto and parmesan. And the meatballs were served over mashed potatoes which we loved!   Currently, I can only speak to Josephine's and Aubergine in regards to food, but I certainly will be back to try others. Once again, another solid addition to our food scene here in Pittsburgh. Smallman Galley is worth the hype - get there!",

    "text": "I absolutely love the concept of this place!  Four aspiring restaurateurs are mentored and given a place to mature their ideas and personal notions.  They get to run a restaurant without having the typical fears of most start up restaurants.  The guys that developed this place are two U.S. Navy Lieutenants.  They really hit a gold mine with the implementation of Smallman Galley.    On to brunch, and why we were here.  We had just finished running in the Great Race.  We walked in looked around at the different menus and grabbed a seat at the bar.  This is essential if you plan on having a drink because I don't think they have a wait staff.  We ordered a beer and engaged the bartender in conversation requesting some tips for a couple of rookies on how it works.  She explained the bar is separate as are all the restaurants.  You can stand in the line of your restaurants choice, order and they will either text you when your food is ready, or in my case, bring it directly to me since I was in eyesight of the cashier.  I looked and chose Carota Cafe, my husband chose another restaurant.  Now what I really wanted was sold out.  SOLD OUT?!  It was about 11 am, they had only been opened an hour and already out of a dish.  I was a little disappointed having gotten worked up to wanting the Eggs and Kale.  I decided to stay with the restaurant and I ordered Herb Baked Eggs, this came with two eggs baked in cast iron skillet, chimichurri, roasted carrot, radish & kale, whole wheat sourdough toast for $12.00.    We walked back to the bar to await our food which came out relatively quick.  As previously stated mine was hand delivered.   Now my \"newbieness\" really showed through when I was like can I have some silverware?  Sure you can, get up and go get it at a communal table.  Now that I am broke in I totally get it.  This is like an upscale mess hall or cafeteria.  This keeps overhead down, and allows the chefs to concentrate on the important thing, the food.    I go to take my first bite, and it is piping hot.  Right out of the oven, all is wonderful with the world.  The favors of this dish were strong, maybe a little too much because it was so rich I couldn't finish it all.  It was incredibly tasty what I managed to eat just again very rich and filling.    To end brunch I ordered an El Coffee, Bourbon, Amaro Averna, and cold brew coffee $11.00.  Yea I spent almost the same amount on my drink as I did my food but this was totally worth it!  Charmingly concocted cocktail.  I love all things coffee and bourbon, so I was sold.  Nice punch there too, just what the doctor ordered.  I can't wait to go back and try this place again.  Great addition to the Pittsburgh Restaurant scene, or should I say 5 great additions, including the bar.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, how have I not written a review for one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh? Smallman Galley absolutely makes my top 5 list. It's such an incredible space - when you walk in, you'll find a bar sprawled out on one side, four kitchens operating on the other, and seating for eager diners available in the back.  The four kitchens thing isn't just fantastic because an entire group of people can come in and mix and match any variety of entrees or appetizers from different vendors, allowing them all to try a variety of cooking styles and flavors. The best part about the space is that it provides those kitchens and their chefs with an operating space for 18 months - that's 18 months to finalize strategies, build a fan base, and hit the ground running when the chefs head on out into what is becoming a very competitive city with lots of high quality dining options.  To date, I've sampled a handful of items and loved every single one of them. Loaded fries from Provision's? Utterly delicious - and Provision's asparagus and eggs proved during another visit that they have the ability to serve lighter, healthier fare, too. Speaking of, the zucchini grilled cheese from Carota Cafe? Fantastically fresh - it's my favorite item from Smallman Galley to date, even including the egg-and-vegetable laden breakfast sandwich they served up for me earlier this year.  Unfortunately, I'm not in the Strip as often as I would like, and so my number of dining experiences here are still in the single digits. But I have never been disappointed here, and even when the current line-up of chefs heads out into the city, I know that I'll be returning to Smallman to enjoy its next four kitchen start-ups - and to enjoy a few more libations at the bar, which just add to the overall unique experience in this little Pittsburgh gem. Do yourself a favor and stop in here soon if you can - you'll be glad you did!",

I love that you can have so many options with 4 separate restaurant menus and an on-site bar. If someone can't find something they like, there's something wrong with them!  I've had lots of favorites in the first batch of restaurants and new favorites in the second batch. I actually am growing to appreciate their brunch options (since the other breakfast stops in the Strip have become such tourist traps). Common Place coffee is clutch in the mornings.",

We finally carved out a Friday night and three of us went to Smallman Galley for dinner before a night out.  It was packed. I guess our mistake was coming on a Friday night. I get that it's a cafeteria-style place, but when you're looking for seating for two hours it really kills your experience. This place is way too small for how popular it is. It doesn't help that they serve alcohol so people just camp out all night.  The pizza place was sold out and the other places were sold out of a lot of options as well. Some of them didn't even have time to mark what was sold out so I waited in line for 20 minutes to get a tea at one point and then was told they didn't have any.  We never did find seating. I waited in a random line that us customers had kind of established and when I was at the front of the line, oblivious people kept just taking seats. Not against the rules, though, since the line wasn't official or anything. It was just chaos.   We ate our food standing up in a random corner. I don't remember if it was good because I was just so angry about standing and hot from the crowded room.  This being said, I would like to try it again on a slower night. I'll post an update if I ever make it back.",

They had some solid cider options on tap, I got a great light bodied red wine from Cotes du Rhone. We hung out for a few hours - there's lots of space and seating. It never got too crowded either. One couple in our group got pupusas - one with cheese and potato, one with meat - we all had bites because they were big and filling! Awesome flavor. The meat one was spicy.   I got a kick out of the VHS tape style drink menu with an homage to The Sandlot.  Definitely a good night out spot for drinks with friends!",

I had the mushroom pizza with extra salami and it was horrendous: the so-called pizza is just a thin layer of dried cheese and marinara sauce thrown onto a stale Focaccia. The salami was extremely salty.  My friend had a skirt steak, and the waitress never asked how he liked his steak so we assumed it'd be medium-well. Turns out it was still raw in the center.

They were just okay, the cilantro slaw was flavorful, but other than that I was missing any spice at all and was really just overwhelmed with the sweetness of the pineapple. Not bad, but $13 for two tacos is on the pricey side, so I'd expect the flavor to knock my socks off at that price.   My friends got pizza, burgers, and pho that they really loved and I admittedly had food envy.

This was my first time here, and I've been dying to try Iron Born Pizza based on their reviews. I got a veggie pizza, it was called Garden something or other. I can't remember the exact name. The crust was coated in crispy cheese and the inside of it was nice and fluffy, not too dense. I would have liked to have more veggies on it. There was shaved asparagus, but my pallet couldn't quite locate the flavor of any gevvies aside from the mushrooms. Other than that, it was delicious. One pizza will definitely feed 2 hungry people.

    "text": "I had a hard time deciding what to order with 4 unique chefs and plenty of creative menu offerings. The Burger of the Moment special by Provisions caught my eye. Provisions : Beef Pattie | Smoked Blue Cheese | Bacon | Whole Grain Mustard Aioli | Organic Greens | Onion Jam | Cheddar | Sesame Challah Bun. I did have a bit of FOMO after placing my order. I was in a food & chef incubator with all these fun dishes and I went with a burger...? I'm meant to be an experimental foodie. But I am so glad I did choose the burger. I am serious when I say it was amazing. Through my life travels (haha minuscule) I've tipped my toes into the world of unique \"artisan\" burgers. Gordon Ramsey's lamb & goats cheese burger is at the top of my list. This burger of the moment by Provisions joined that top 5 list, conquering my FOMO.  It was tasty, juicy and I barely shared a bite with my boyfriend. Even the fries were unique! If you're not into salty you might not like these fries, but I am. So I loved them. They were crisp, not greasy, very salty (celery salt maybe?), but also seasoned well (parsley maybe?) for an added dimension of flavor. I am so over plain boring fries.",

    "text": "I think the idea of having a lot of up and coming chefs in the same place, like a startup incubator, is innovative and exciting. The ambiance is kind of like a very hip cafeteria, with lots of loud banter and art installations. There are both options for communal and individual/group tables- however you have to flag seating down yourself. Once you're able to flag down a table, it's a very fun experience for a bunch of friends, especially because it feels like you can be as rowdy as you want. However, the food didn't impress me that much considering the price point, so although it was a fun experience, I don't think I will be returning until new restaurants rotate in.  I went with some friends, and we tried all of the four restaurants there. I ordered the Molletes to share, and the Cochnita Pibil from Colonia. My other friends got the Red Pie, a Banh Mi, and a Risotto. We also got the S'mores from brunoise.   I think the dish we were all most impressed with was the pizza. It was very fluffy and flavorful, and piping hot! One of my friends even said that they wanted to come back just for the pizza. The molletes were fine, but I expected more from the avocado puree. It was also kind of small as the only appetizer for 4 people...probably should have ordered another dish of something. I wished that the Cochnita Pibil had more going on, either in terms of the number of ingredients or packing more of a punch with the flavoring. I also wished that the portion of meat was larger. However, I was very glad to see some more Latin American options in Pittsburgh! Now if only I could find a good chilaquiles joint... My friend said that the risotto was overall good, but some complaints he had was that it was a little watery and the lemon flavoring was quite strong. My other friend who got the Banh Mi commented that there were better options for banh mi (that are also cheaper) in town. Finally, the S'mores dish was definitely as photogenic as photos on Yelp and Instagram suggest. Nothing to complain about there.",

Walk in and pick your spot, order at counter and food is served. You can eat at the extensive bar, side tables or in the back dining area for community seating at long picnic style tables. The decor of wood, dried flowers and metals makes for a rustic and shabby chic feel; making the dining experience comfortable, laid back and fun. I had a melt with side salad and homemade pickles from Toast and the meal was perfection. Great selection of beers and insanely delicious cocktails. It gets super busy so be prepared for crowds, conversation, laughter and maybe a bit of a wait. With that said, wait time is minimal even when it's packed. Awesome all around.",

Located in the Strip District, it is a wonderful location for shopping and then a quick lunch. The space hosts 4 other counters where you can order a variety of dishes, including Vegan pizza. We decided on a tofu bowl with rice from...well, I can't remember the name now, but it is the 2nd one when you come in the front door. Ordering is quick and simple. After you place your order you can either sit in the bar area or sit in the well-lit side area. Since it was not after 5 pm we decided to sit in the side area. It did not take long to get our meal, which was delicious. We had also ordered a Ginger Lemonade which was divine.   Outside of the food being delicious, the service was impeccable. After receiving our meal, someone else came by to ask how we were doing and how we had heard about the place. Come to find out they are opening another location. Since I am not from Pittsburgh I didn't remember because I didn't care, but it was nice of him to mention it.   Our dishes were cleared quickly before we decided it depart. I will certainly come here again the next time I am in Pittsburgh.   Word to the wise: lunch is pretty pricey so be forewarned.",

There is a ton of different seating areas including community tables or individual tables.   From Banhmilicious, we got the banh mi which comes with some bone broth pho, which is PERFECT for dipping the banh mi in. We also got the Funeral Bowl from Colonia which was super good as well! I like that there was such variety in the bowl but I do wish there was a little more meat to go with the beans and rice. Also, if it had some additional sauce on it, but the food itself was flavorful.   The place is definitely slightly pricey but I feel like it is worth it. Delicious food and there are so many different options for what you feel like getting!   Hopefully will be back soon.",

So glad I was able to make it in time because the provision burgers are LEGIT!!   We had \"the burger\" and \"the farm\" both were cooked a perfect medium.  Fries were delish and the salad was a really good refreshing side.  God the lemon aioli as well on the side for the fries and it was delicious.  Only odd thing is they don't have ketchup... the burgers are very rich and could have used an acidic condiment or more pickle to add a bite/freshness.    I'd give the burger a 4 - 4 1/2 because of this.  The overall smallman galley concept is 5 star!",

We also got the salad from Town, and the thin cut onions and fried/toasted chunks of cheese enriched the salad enough to make me forget that my wife made us order a salad. It wasn't until we were half way through that it struck us that if both dishes were so good, why not try to combine the 2?!?! Needless to say, the mash-up was a huge success. I think the two spots should collaborate... Oven's spicy pie topped with Town's salad. Epic.  Drinks get 2-stars. Options were good and the bartender who first greeted us was friendly... but from there it went downhill. The other bartender served us the most part there, and she was rude. I first noticed it when she was curt with the party next to us, and further experienced her elitist charm while ordering with her. Tried to make small talk to lighten the mood, and she was not having it. When we left, my wife asked \"what the fck was her problem?!\".... and my wife uses the f-word maybe 5 times a year (4 times are typically towards Trump).",

We were lucky enough to grab two at the bar, which was perfect, as we were able to get drinks very easily.  Our second visit was on a Wednesday evening, around 8:45 PM. After unsuccessfully being served at Gaucho because we arrived a half hour before closing time, this turned out to be a great weeknight option (that's also walking distance from Gaucho). I think many of the kitchens at Smallman Galley close at 9 PM, which gave us more than enough time to decide from the four restaurant options.  This time, we sat in an entirely separate seating area that was less crowded and not as noisy. I like how there are two different sections to sit, depending on what you're in the mood for. We went with burgers from Provision, and they were very good. Love the concept and how casual the entire process is.",

    "text": "I have been to the Smallman Galley a few times now, and it pains me to write what follows. I initially went to the Yelp Event, and absolutely loved this place. I was very excited to come back and try this place again with my family. When we came back we got a table and everyone split up to choose their own meals.   I settled on the Chili and Toast, my Fiancee got the Squash Grilled Cheese. My dad had wanted to get the Chicken Pot Pie, but when he went to place his order the guy said he wasn't taking anymore orders at the moment. This was unerstandable to a degree since it was incredibly crowded. So my dad waited a little more than half an hour, he went back up and was again told they weren't taking any  orders. So he went to another station and got Potato Skins. And my mom got Carrot Soup and a salad.   I thought my chili and toast tasted AMAZING and personally left very happy. But that is unfortunatley not the experience of everyone in my party.My Fiancee's first Squash Grilled Cheese came out extremely burnt, as in all you could taste was the burnt bread. She had to take it back and ask for a new one. They brought out a new one, and were very apologetic. So they do get points for good customer service, but someone looked at that sandwich and still sent it out, which never should have happened. The sandwich was also served with a side of Pickled Celery. Sometimes people try too hard to be creative and it tastes pretty terrible.  My Parents enjoyed what they got, but it just didn't really all seem to flow so smoothly. The bar is probably the best in the city, but it is extremely cramped. Of course to a certain degree being an incubator, they have 18 months to sink or swim. And in that 18 months you are bound to witness some sinking ships.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now with the full intent of going back for more, once for a Yelp event on their second official day of operation, and for their NYE's party. Both parties were good. The concept is unique and fantastic, a great way to expose new chefs to the area [more visa a versa] or tide your 18 months while you prep to have you own larger space.   I love the exposed brick and long communal tables that are on both ends of the space. There are two main entrances and an additional set of doors by the bar area, which i assume to open up when it starts to get warm again later this year. There are a few tables that are tucked away in the corner that are a little hard to get to, but it's new and they may still play with the set-up. My favorite part is that they have a few seats that dangle from the bar area into the long connector pass where you can look over the different incubator spaces.  A really neat features that I like of the different spaces, other than the exciting menu concepts, is that they text you the wait time and when your food is ready. This way, you have some opportunity to either grab a table to get a drink at the bar and be efficient with your time.   The bar itself is sleek and neat, primarily stocked with different local and countrywide microbrews. They definitely have a lot Pittsburgh name brands which is exciting.   A few things are a little bit frustrating but they do the best they can. In our case we were dealing with full houses, so this will probably not always be the case on a normal night, but people are pushed around trying to get back and forth between standing in line for beer, to getting your food, to getting to your table and getting to the restrooms. It can get a little cramped and there is a curb and a ramp, so watch your step.   Also, there is no way to check into the individual incubator spaces to give individual feedback and I feel awkward giving it here to reflect the space itself. However, I will.  I have tried two of the current restaurants, Carota Cafe and Provision Pgh. A quick highlight of both:  At Carota I have tried the Carrot soup which was delicious and I practically drank it rather than spooning. I enjoyed the texture, which was very good and creamy [without cream of course]. The Octopus was amazing, I am impressed at her ability to sear it so well give such a small space, paired very well with the collard chimichurri.   We also tried the horseradish gnocchi with black pepper ricotta and hen of the wood. [I love mushroom] However, The gnocchi were too sweet and unimpressive and holy crap on the horseradish pepper ricotta. It sneaks up on you, but your mouth then is burning, and not in a good way. I was perplexed, because the other dish was so good! I suspect it was made in advance to easily smear when needed, and the pepper intensified by the time 8 o'clock rolled around.  At Provision I had a hit and miss experience. The Burger is OUT OF THIS WORLD, delicious. We ordered it medium but it definitely came out medium rare. I personally like it medium rare but my friend got it. Neither of us were disappointed. The Umami Aioli is fantastic and the greens give it a good bite where it mingles with the smoked mushroom. [Jesus, I love mushrooms]. Also the burger is topped with sesame seed which is a nice twist and delicious. The fries are fantastic, but only the side of fries. They are perfectly crispy and the aioli you get to dip it in is awesome [it's a peanutty aioli]. Delish!  Now, going downhill, the Bahn Mi, while delicious on it's self has too much bread overshadowing it. I eventually made it open faced on my own and enjoyed it more. The side of greens was a flop for me. While delicious on the burger, it's has a pungent, bitter taste to the salad dressing and the raw potato slices in it make it even more so. No Bueno. The smothered fries were a mixed bag. Starting with those awesome fries from before, the lentils are good but there are way too many of them, the goat cheese again is excellent, but the squash at the bottom was practically chilly. So when you went from top to bottom it went from hot to cold and ruined the dish, mushing up the texture of the fries and making us leave it mostly standing. A shame.  As said before I will definitely be back for the other two and to try some more dishes from the first two. I'm so happy this space exist in the city.",

Really fun cool concept where you can pick from 4 restaurants- order at the counter then give them your cell and you are texted when your order is ready. Nicer atmosphere than I expected, cafeteria style seating with bar located near seating.  Veggie perspective - definetly have a few options among the 4 restaurants- carota cafe had the most options so I went there for entree AND dessert   Carota cafe review: (chef Jessica Lewis) I loved the kale and egg (great flavored fresh and though it doesn't look like a lot of food it filled me up) dish. Yucca fries were mediocre, perhaps I'm not used to yucca but very dry and chewy- the aioli was great tho! Lastly I finished the True chocolate babka which was perfect and not too sweet.  They gave me a small glass of the beet mulled wine which was delicious- and on the house! This was a limited opening - looking forward to more visits to the galley!  Update- just revisited and continued to be impressed by the veggie options available especially at carota cafe. At carota-I had the noodles and broth with soba noodles which was filling but I probably should have chosen something else. I did greatly enjoy the bread and spread (kabucha squash spread). We had the sundae at provision which was delicious (apple and cheddar biscuit with Apple icecream) although I do wish it had more icecream.",

As a side note, as I was getting out of my car a gentlemen approached me informing me he was just released from prison and would like to exchange his wedding band with me for cash for a greyhound bus. The more he talked, the more it sounded like a scam. I'm not sure if this is a common thing around this area in the Strip, but keep this one in mind if you do check this place out.",

    "text": "I should start by saying that part of the reason I didn't give four-stars is just that the format of the dining experience is not really my preference and I felt it got a little awkward and clunky to try to get drinks and food and stuff in an orderly fashion.    We went on a Friday night and it was busy but still not so much that we couldn't easily find a place to sit.  We went to the bar to try to order drinks.  It was a little too Hunger Games-esque and cutthroat for me.  I'm a more quiet, politely wait your turn kind of guy, and it became obvious very quickly that that was not going to work here.  Once we were victorious in finally landing a few of their signature cocktails (they just switched to a new cocktail menu), they were very good.  There were three of us, and we went to Iron Born, Joey's, and Bahnmilicious.  The pizza got great reviews overall, though I personally could never have eaten much more than a few bites of it because it's a bit greasy (but that's what Detroit-style is, so again, just a personal preference, nothing negative about what they're doing).  Two of my friends loved the bahn mi and found it to be filling and well worth the price.  I personally had a special at Joey's, which was a spicy chicken gyro.  It was really good, but the people working that stand were NOT pleasant.  It's not often you can literally say someone has a scowl on their face, but that was totally the case here.  I felt like they were ticked off that I came to their stand.  Whatever, the food was good (though the menu there was completely different from the menu they have listed on line, so if there's something specific you're absolutely wanting to try, you might want to call and verify they still have it on their menu--Iron Born also had a few differences in their special pizzas from what was listed).  Overall, good food, not the friendliest staff but you really only have to order from them and then you can try to forget about that, and a difficult-to-order-from bar with solid cocktails once you get them.",

I love the concept, and the food is executed superbly. I feel like the space might need some work, however. It is really hard to find a table, and it is not at all obvious how best to queue up for food.  Given the latest trends in food, it can actually be really hard to find good (read: non-pasta) veg food at hip new American restaurants. Not so with the current crowd at Smallman Galley.  My top single food item is the Provision fries. They come with lentils, a lemon aioli, goat cheese and pickled shallots. They are so good. Even the plain fries are delicious!  My favorite restaurant overall is (obviously) Carota, which has many lovely veg options. My current favorite is the squash grilled cheese (manchego + squash + pesto on seedy bread - yum!)  The prices are great in light of the portion size and overall quality. I am very pleased in this regard.  A note: while these 4 chefs will be around for another year or so, they do change their menus (a lot of them are focused on seasonal ingredients) so check back often!",

I wish that I had been hungrier - and I wish that I had ordered more things - but I was pleased with the dish that I did try. I selected the Carmelized Onion & Pear Tart at Aubergine Bistro. The crust was flaky, and the filling was well-balanced. Looking at the menu now, I should have also gotten the risotto... the lamb & pork meatballs... the shrimp & squid ink pasta... and the roasted pork belly. So many things look outstanding here. Plus, even with this long list of must-haves to try next time I visit, I've barely even looked at Aubergine Bistro's three competitor's menus. Looks like the next round of Smallman Galley restaurants launch on June 6th, 2017, so we'll have to return within the next six months to enjoy the cuisine from the current round of restaurants.",

    "text": "What a genius idea. There are 4 \"restaurants\" to choose from and the dining is chic cafeteria style. Not like normal cafeteria but like a high school movie dining hall where you think, \"NO high school looks like that!\" Well this place looks like that!   The food was delicious and we ate at Provisions and the chef was amazing! I love being able to meet a chef who is so proud of his food! I had a burger and he said that he donates $1 for every burger sold on certain days (I can't remember, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I think) to a local food bank!   I cannot wait to go back and get drinks and more food! I would recommend going to the Smallman Galley's twitter or website before you venture out. We were planning on going to dinner tonight there, however they are hosting a private event and it will be closed. Don't worry! It didn't discourage my voting scale! lol",

The crust is fluffy yet crispy on the bottom, with crunchy bits of cheese all around. A little pricier than what I would usually pay for pizza, but completely worth it.  Both times the Vietnamese restaurant left me a bit disappointed. The bahn mi didn't have much flavor to it and was quite sparse with the toppings. The Vietnamese brunch with Chinese sausage, rice, and an egg also lacked flavor. I'll definitely be back, but for the delicious pizza!",

Wanted to try something newer, so we picked this place.   First let's start with the drinks, the happy hour specials were 1/2 off all drinks...ALL DRINKS! I had a cocktail that was a beet infused vodka. I personally loved it, but you have to really be a fan of beets.   We all ordered food from different places and were sharing it. The burger from the meat place was delectable, the fries were also great, we shared toast with homemade cottage cheese and pineapples which was delicious, then had an apple upside down cake for dessert.   Overall it was a great experience, a fun environment and an awesome addition to the Burgh.",

There are 4 mini \"restaurants\" behind the bar and you can order and eat wherever. The purpose is to give these new restaurants a place to try their food and learn how to run a restaurant. Upon their success, the owner helps them (training/support) open their own restaurant.   We got food at Provision (burger & provision fries were simply amazing) and sat at the bar to eat (Helltown HopFrenzy & BrewGents Blonde Ale) and drink. Wow. Just simply wow.",

    "text": "I have been to the smallman galley twice now this week, first on Tuesday with my father for lunch and last night with my wife for dinner. First off I have to admit that I am a sucker for the concept here. Get 4 up and coming chefs that probably can't afford their own restaurant space and stick them in 4 separate kitchens right next to each other.  They then have 18 months to refine their concept before they are helped by the smallman galley in finding a space to open their restaurant and a new \"class\" comes in.  The seating and everything else is shared by everyone and its a win for everyone.  In some ways it feels like a cafeteria but don't take that lightly as the food is really good and not at all what you would find in a cafeteria.  Walking into the smallman galley you find yourself in a pretty cool industrial space.  There is exposed ductwork and brick walls with tables fitting right in being made of large planks of wood and the chairs being metal.  Outside of the areas where the kitchen is there is also a large seating and a decent sized bar which happens to have a half off happy M-F 5-7.  The first time that I came here I ended up ordering the Bahn Mi from the Provision Pub. It consisted of chicken skin, liver smear, cilantro, pickles, jalepeno and mayo on a baguette and came with a side of fries.  The fries were excellent and had a nice crispy exterior and soft interior while also being seasoned nicely.  However the Bahn Mi I was a little conflicted about.  I absolutely loved the chicken skin and the crunchy texture that it added to the sandwich.  It was the liver smear which turned me off though as it had a gamey type flavor which was hard to get past.  Then the second time that I visited I went with the provision fries from provision as an appetizer to split with my wife and then decided on the duck from Josephine's Toast.  The fries came out first and were on top of a bed of roasted squash puree and came topped with lentils, goat cheese and a lemon aioli.  Much like my previous visit the fries themselves were cooked perfectly and really great.  All of the toppings on it were pretty good too and my wife an I quickly devoured them.  Then after a bit of a wait my duck entree was ready.  Whenever I picked it up I have to admit that the plating looked great but it was also sort of weird to see this amazing looking dinner over top of a piece of smothered toast.  Knowing that this is her concept I accepted that fact but I feel like the dinner could have easily stood on its own.  The plate consisted of duck on top of a piece of toast with crispy kale, tart cherries and a tart cherry sauce all around it.  I found the duck to be cooked nicely to around a medium and enjoyed the flavor of it.  It was especially good dipped into the tart cherry sauce which I wish I could bottle up.  I also really enjoyed the crispy kale which was had a nice crunch to it.  As I mentioned above the toast was the only thing that I found to be weird about the meal although to be fair it wasn't bad.  I just felt like it didn't really fit into the otherwise delectable gourmet meal.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  I love pretty much everything about this place from the ambience to the choice of food and even the food itself.",

    "text": "A neat concept for a restaurant incubator.  Pittsburgh doesn't have many places like this and it's a cool place to go for dinner or drinks if you're in the neighborhood.  I went here with a group of five on a Thursday night around 7:30 and it wasn't too packed with a decent amount of seating still available for our group.  This time I went to Aubergine for the Chicken and Dumplings.  It was simple, and I don't mean that as a bad thing.  Simple can be good, especially for something like chicken and dumplings when what you want is something wholesome to warm you up from a rain, cold evening.  I'll be doing this again the next time i'm at Smallman Galley and it's on the menu.  Other times I've been there and gotten the toast cake (from Josephine's Toast) and the Provision fries (from Provision PGH).   The toast cake, is an interesting idea, but not pulled off all the time.  Some of the cake had the right texture, but there were other parts that tasted more like stale bread than cake (or toast).  The Provision fires were great, and a delicious flavor profile.  They go great with many of the beers they had at the bar.  Finally, the concept of getting a text message when your food is ready has some problems.  It's great because it reduces the need for waitstaff to deliver food when it's cooked.  On the other hand, by the time I get there my phone is dead or there's been a miscommunication about what my number is and I never get the text.  It defeats the point of not having waitstaff if they cooks still have to walk around the tables shouting your name to deliver your food.  Still, I'll be going back and taking visitors as well when they come into town.  If people want to talk bad about Pittsburgh's restaurant game, I'll be offering this as a counter.",

Smallman Galley is an innovative concept and indicative of the forward thinking happening right now in the Pittsburgh food scene.  My husband had a ramen noodle dish from Aubergine it was good but the broth was a little under-seasoned. I got the herb eggs from Carota cafe. They were absolutely delicious. I also got toast from Toast with espresso hazelnut butter and blackberry jam- very yummy.   One issue that we encountered (and I don't know if this can be fixed) is that when people in your party order from different venues the food comes at different times, which I guess is a naturally result of this type of set up.  We will certainly be back. This will be a go to when we have out of town guests and we want to show off our city!",

Had the little tike with me so happy to see that they had hi-chairs although their hi-chairs didn't come with the \"seatbelt\" usually included to tie rambunctious babies down like mine so I was hold on to one of his legs to prevent him from climbing on the table (sigh).  But on to the food.  Ordered the avacado toast with egg (scrambled) and Ginger Pear spice treat from Toast.  The flavor/taste of both were great.  I really enjoyed the savoriness and creaminess of the avacodo toast and the ginger pear sweet treat was a nice complement to a savory dish.  My only complaint was that \"toast\" was the foundation for the Ginger/Pear treat which I get but it didn't really work because it made what would have been an uh-mazing dessert a bit dry and flaky.  The bottom portion which was the toast just fell apart and it was difficult to eat with the rest of the dish.  I ended up eating the top portion which was very good - it had a subtle ginger spice taste but I could tase the delciousness of the pears.",
