Knowing that the people making my spicy chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese on a golden wheat bun  and a side of chicken nuggets are working AND don't hate their life really makes it taste that much better. Also, it is a small inspiration that my job probably isn't all that bad either, and you can't put that kind of mental high five on the menu. If I'm eating fast food chicken, it better be Chick-Fil-A, and this location is one of the best around.",

A staff person will walk around and and ask dining customers if the food was okay or offer to get another refill or take away your tray. I have not witnessed any frowns are surly attitudes yet. This place gets extremely busy and crowded around lunch time yet the service remains consistent.   I've never used the restroom but the dining area is clean and the condiment counter is organized. On some occasions there will be fresh flowers on the tables.   Chik-fil-a gets 5-stars for their food and pleasant, professional service!",

Cold, under cooked or over cooked fries  At first we got an apology for putting pickles on my sandwich then after months we found hair in our fries and got no apologie. The manager thought we lied.

Regardless, if I'm willing to put up with feeling awful after eating, this is one of the better Chick-Fil-A's to eat at.  Also, the new chocolate chip cookies at Chick-Fil-A are absurdly delicious.

If you have to wait for your food they give you a coupon for a free sandwich. (You rarely wait). Their food is consistently hot and fresh. If you are not satisfied for any reason they will fix it and make sure you are happy.  They have great family nights and events like tonight where if you wear Pirate gear you get a free chicken sandwich.  The restaurant is always clean and they usually have someone who will come to your table to get you refills or take your garbage. They are all about detail including fresh flowers on your table. Well Done Chick Fil A!",

They also have a promotion that if you like them on facebook and wear a $5 Chick Fil A tee shirt they will have monthly giveaways.    Food was good (as always), large portion of fries, fresh and hot unlike other fast food restaurants.  I disagree with Carrie's comments from late 2011.  Bathroom was very clean tonight; well I saw someone clean it.  Restaurant was very clean and they had 20 little ones tongiht.  I'm sure if you go during a crowded time it might not be perfect.    I would be shocked to find a Chick Fil A anywhere that regularly performed poorly.  Corporate would never allow it.",

Sure, you can squeeze a little grease out of each nugget, but it's fast food. Go peddle your diet food somewhere else! Of course, they do have some healthier items, but the \"grilled\" chicken is terrible. Plus, waffle fries! The milkshakes are good too, but they don't quite hit Steak 'n Shake levels.  SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE Chick-Fil-A treats their employees really well. In fact, their managers are some of the highest paid individuals in the business. (Their business practices have been studied for this very reason.) This treatment trickles down to their employees creating /actual/ job satisfaction. I absolutely love dealing with the employees here! They say things like, \"How can I help you?\", \"How are you today?\" and \"It would be my pleasure\", and they mean it! To wit, they usually have someone walking around the store just asking people if they need anything, bringing out sauces, refilling drinks, and pre-busing tables.  Most of the time the restaurant is clean. As another reviewer said, this location can get really, really busy, and I think that the staff does get overwhelmed. Sometimes they need to send someone out to sweep and wipe down tables.  They have a play place for the kids. This location also has lots of fun, free events.

I ordered the deluxe chicken sandwich with a side salad.  2) we ordered a kids meal for my daughter. A decent amount of food plus she got milk with it which was great.  3) I liked how they brought the food out to you. It was super quick.  4) It was actually clean for a fast food restaurant  5) there is a kids play space. Its small but does the job. They have hand wipes available for when the kids are done playing.  While I don't eat fast food on the regular, I will be back in the future.",

There have been times I've gone here where there were a dozen cars in front of me and the wait was still less than 10 minutes.   This last time I was there was quite different. There weren't any cars in front of me in the drive thru. I ordered quickly, then sat for almost 10 minutes outside of the cashiers window waiting for my order.  I would have understood if they were understaffed or something, but as I looked through the window I saw about 6 people standing around talking while 2 other employees did all of the work.   I won't let one bad visit change my over all opinion of this chickfila, but 3 stars for now.",

It's not super expensive but more expensive than other fast food. However it is worth it. This particular location is always busy and their parking lot is crowded but there is more parking just need to walk a little.",

    "text": "You basically can't go wrong with Chick-Fil-A and this location doesn't disappoint. I've visited several times and have been pleased with each and every visit. The first time I visited I was with my toddlers for a family night.  They had a table set up on the side of the restaurant with a fun craft.  In addition to the fun (and free!) craft, they also had a sundae bar and balloons for the kids.  It was nice to have an evening out with a fun activity without breaking the bank. Chick-fil-a employees are always pleasant and accommodating.  I absolutely love the fact that they will assist you with getting high chairs to a table or with getting food to your table if your hands are full with trying to wrangle kids.  Sometimes even family friendly sit down restaurants aren't that accommodating.   A meal might cost you more than other fast food chains (mostly because they don't have a dollar/value menu like some places have) but the quality far surpasses any other chain which makes the prices worth it.  Food is always fresh and tasty.  But if for some reason you have an issue with your order, the staff is always quick to rectify the situation. There are almost always offers for something if you use the app, which is a huge plus. I definitely recommend chick-fil-a and the wonderful staff at this location.",

I am fortunate enough to work directly across the parking lot from this CFA. I frequently hit the long line for my fix on my lunch hour. (Number one, no pickles, diet lemonade...perfection.)   One day, to my embarrassment, I forgot my debit card, and couldn't find it anywhere! Fortunately, the amazing girl behind the counter just said, I'll take care of it. WHAT?! Real life. I've never had that happen to me before! I wish she would have had a nametag on, so she could get the shout out she deserves.   Occasionally, it can get a little busy in here, and the evening crew can slack a little more than the morning crew, but that's to be expected.   All in all, great place.   Happy Eating!",

The chicken sandwich is great, but not AMAZING, like I thought it would be after reading all the hype for so many years... I wish they would offer the biscuit all day, as I think that would be very good but can never try since there ins't a location near my morning commute. In any event, give it a try if you have never had it.",

I'm glad I did, as this location was consistent in quality with other ones I've been to! This is a good spot for grabbing a quick meal on the way to the gates. The lines didn't take a long time, and neither did waiting for the food. The cashiers were efficient and helpful, which was great! I got a regular meal with a chicken sandwich, waffle fries, and sweet tea. The whole meal was yummy and filled me with energy for the rest of my trip! I would definitely drop by again for another meal!",

Fried food gives me a heartburn  However I'm in Pittsburgh meeting up my in laws and wanted to get something before we catch a movie . Place seemed packed so I had my hopes up. But really it wasn't anything special. Their signature sauce my wife and in-laws liked it is nothing but a mix of mustard mayonnaise and bbq in other word a slightly smokey honey mustard. The meat on the other hand was spot on. Very nice flavor and well cooked. It was real chicken and you can tell from the thickness of it also was moist. Wasn't very happy with their waffle fries as when I hear about waffle fries I expect some seasoning.  So the bottom line is the chicken is great but rest is just what you expect from a chain  fast food joint.",

Sometimes when it's nice outside and there's a huge line in the drive thru they come out and take your order to get you in and out. If I could live here I would. The only con I can think of is the fact that these guys are closed on Sundays but I respect that and enjoy my Chicfila Chicken nugget obsession six days a week. Their lemonade also compliments the whole meal. The location is perfect to my house and it's right near the waterfront. I end up here every time I'm at the Target down the street.",

Ordering is a breeze and you're able to customize your order any way you want. If you want a Chick-fil-A sandwich with no pickles but bacon and cheese instead go for it, the app is your oyster. One of the best features of the app is curbside pickup. I can order my food when i'm still in a nearby store or leaving work and have it ready to be delivered to my car or pickup in store when I get there. No more waiting in long lines in store or through the drive-thru. Does it get much better than that?  It also goes without saying the their customer service at this location is hands down one of the best experiences out there today. Customer service is always consistently great and everyone is beyond friendly.  I can't give them enough compliments on that alone.",
