    "text": "We decided to stop in because one of our diners had a gift card...  So we headed north on 79 after an evening at the Point (to see the giant duck).  The lot was full, and we almost headed back toward Ohio River Ave, but got out to check.  Nice place, but located between a gas station and housing complex.    When I entered, I was weary to see the table-tops -- immaculate with fine settings - but I was in khaki shorts.  As I turned to leave, the incoming group had small children, and looked as if they were dressed for a little-league game.  Mesh shorts and all.  So we stayed.  Glad we did.    \"Casual Fine Dining\" is an understatement.  Professional staff and fine food served among casually hip (or not-so-hip) soccer moms on the way home from practice.  Decent wine list, and small menu.  The calimari was some of the best around, get it! Great with the (bottled) sweet-chili sauce.  The stuffed zucchini ribbons were tasty, if soggy.  The veal marsala had a great sauce, and the stuffed double pork chop was cooked perfectly, bones frenched, and lightly stuffed with a mix of green apples, sausage, banana peppers and sage.  Amazing.  Unfortunately, the mashed reds were cold and congealed.  The pasta dishes were bland and boring.  Olive Garden serves better.  Choose wisely, and you won't be disappointed.",

Being from the Maryland area, we opted not to get crabcakes, but the server told us they were excellent and one of the more popular items on the menu.  As an app for the table, we ordered a variety of small plates, but the calamari really stood out.  Calamari was crispy, nicely breaded, but not too much breading (many places are very guilty of this).  Great flavoring and not too salty.  I also ordered shrimp bisque as a starter - would not recommend, it was over salted to the point where I could not finish it and I usually love soup!  Service was excellent, especially accommodating the one child in our group.  Our server also made sure I always had a drink in my hand!  Be sure of where you plan on sitting too - we thought we originally reserved the outside dining area, but they could not accommodate us as a larger group and we sat inside instead.  Not a big deal, but I've heard the outside dining area is even better.",

    "text": "We've been coming here for awhile and, frankly, it is a schizophrenic place. The ambience is nice. The addition of the louvered screen over the patio make much of the outdoor seating much more useable.   But there have been dramatic changes since the restaurant first opened. Overall, the menu has become much more \"safe\" at the expense of being creative. Seafood preparations are inconsistent (but so are Pittsburgh tastes with respect to how seafood should be prepared).  Expensive seafood (such as scallops) have been replace with cheaper alternatives (chicken) with no change in price. A few weeks ago someone asked for shrimp to be added to the salad and was told that it would be $3/shrimp. 21/30 ct shrimp are $13/lb meaning that 4 shrimp would have bought between 21 and 30 in a bag.  The restaurant's main recommendations are the servers and bartenders, who show the customers great respect and attention, but they seem to be hampered by a management more interested in profit than value. They remember what you like and try, very hard, to remember names, but they seem far less motivated than before (and watch our for surveillance cameras which seem to be everywhere in this place, in case you are in witness protection).  Case in point. A few weeks ago another customer was treated to a glass of white wine which replaced the \"premium\" wine by the glass that they normally serve (if people read my other reviews they'll know that I am of the opinion that Pittsburgh restaurants gouge their customers on wine, charging more than 4x/bottle off the wine store price). The glass price was more than $8, but the wine, which was on sale at the local PLCB store was $9.99 for a 1.5 liter bottle! So ONE GLASS cost the equivalent of 8 pours!  In essence, they substituted a cheaper wine for their \"house\" price, but failed to pass the savings onto the customer. Pittsburghers used to understand value. Perhaps they will, again.  This is not the first time that I have seen this. Awhile back they offered a \"bluefin\" tuna dish as the special but claimed that they had run out and that they would offer a yellowfin for the same price.  Now, there is not THAT much difference in taste between bluefin and yellowfin (since all the good bluefin goes to Japan), but there is certainly a difference in price. And to offer the latter at the same price as the former is ludicrous.  There is lot to recommend this place. The ambience and the staff are at the top of the list. But this was the flagship restaurant of the (now) chain and it seems to have lost a lot of its luster.",

    "text": "I ate here this past weekend for an early dinner with my girlfriend and her parents.  Since I was meeting them there and they arrived before me,  I did not actually see much of the restaurant other than the room that we were located in which had a small number of white tablecloth covered tables.   Our group decided to start off our evening with both the Southwest jalapeno corn cakes which were covered in a drizzle of poblano cream and raspberry chipotle sauce and also the crispy calamari which came with a side of chile sauce.  The calamari was good as it was crispy, yet not tough to chew and tasted great when covered with some of the chile sauce.  The corn cakes were also good with the raspberry topping adding some needed sweetness although it was difficult to taste much of the jalepeno.  For my entree I decided on the horseradish crusted Alaskan cod that came with a lemon butter sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My cod was cooked perfectly and came out warm but was very disappointing in taste.  It seemed like the horseradish crust on mine was missing and since cod is such a mild fish, it was almost like eating something flavorless and wet.  This was only only helped by the fact that my lemon butter sauce seemed to be MIA.  The only saving grace of my dish was that the asparagus was cooked nicely and the mashed potatoes were extremely creamy.  I was also able to try the sesame crusted tuna which my girlfriend had ordered and was covered in a soy sauce glaze with wasabi aoili.  It was actually very good with the sauces on it providing some depth which stood in stark contrast to my meal.  For dessert my girlfriend and I decided to split a creme brulee which came topped with some strawberries.  The custard of it was a bit watery but that did not seem to affect the good flavor of it and you could actually see the vanilla bean in the custard.   The bottom line for me is that based on my meal, I would probably not head back here in the future on my own accord.  However, my girlfriends dish was pretty good and I have heard from a friend that his horseradish encrusted cod was very good the night before and so maybe I just got a bad one.",

I had the chicken with crab and the whole dish had one note and was under seasoned (the chicken was cooked well though). My wife had the veal and the dish was overpowered by the tomatoes in the under seasoned sauce. We are not planning to return.",

I always order the shrimp bisque, which has never been anything but spectacular!!!  They are known for their crab cakes as well.  If you ask they can offer you a smaller filet with a crab cake, which is my favorite meal to get!  The filet is always prepared to perfection!  They have outside seating in the summer.  I would suggest making sure you get a table with an umbrella.  I sat at a table with no umbrella once and received some unexpected surprises from above in my water.  The patio is gorgeous for any type of event or dinner.  This place doesn't offer your run of the meal dinner.  They provide you with great service that is friendly and properly timed out.  I prefer to have an eating marathon not a sprint!  They provide this type of service.  As many times as I have been here I Have never complained about the food at all.  I will say that it seems as though the pasta dishes don't seem to be as appealing as the other dishes.  Love this place and would suggest to anyone looking for a great night out to try it out.",

They have a pretty big bar and a great outdoor patio.  They'll even provide lap blankets for a cooler evening (plus there are heat lamps).  Order anything from the menu, you won't be disappointed.  I love the crab cakes, the salmon (although I think they changed  menu recently and there is a different sauce on it from the last time so I can't make any guarantees on that) and the seared scallops in a soy sesame glaze.  The risotto that came with the scallops was creamy and cooked perfectly.  Also, the zucchini ribbon appetizers stuffed with cheese in a roasted red pepper sauce...I could eat them for a meal.  All of the salads are tasty too although I'd recommend splitting one if you're ordering appetizers and dinner.    The downside of Andora's is that it's a little pricey and it's tough to escape from there with under a $30 per person tab for just dinner (no drinks, salads, appetizers or dessert).  You're paying for the quality of the food so it's worth it but it's not a once a week dining experience.  The other downside is I think the indoor dining area is a little dated.  It's not terrible but it's a little stuffy and old-fashioned.  Also, they don't take reservations except for larger parties so you're in for a long wait during peak weekend dining hours.",

My wife and I came here on a recommendation from a friend and we were completely blown away. The atmosphere is warm and cozy as it appears that this restaurant used to be a former dwelling years ago. The noise level can be a little loud but if anything it adds to the atmosphere.  The wait staff at andoras is very knowledgeable and courteous.  When ordering wine they give you the option to sample it to ensure that it is what you're looking for. This may be common practice at higher end restaurants, but for the location of this venue it is a pleasant surprise that this is offered.  The food is second to none. Having gone here in the dead of winter you can sometimes worry about the freshness of the food, but this was not the case at Andoras. The vegetable medleys that are served with many of the dinners were very fresh and delicious. The salad selections were both pleasantly fresh and creatively made.  For the main entree enough can't be said on how fresh literally everything is. My wife had scallops and I had the filet mignon. Very rarely do I order a steak at a restaurant for fear of it being frozen prior to it being cooked. The meat was lightly seasoned and was topped with herb butter as it was brought out to be served. The steak wasn't overly coated in seasonings and sauces which was great because it allowed the flavor of the meat to truly come out.  Overall I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. If you want to impress someone take them here.",

The zucchini rolls were not appealing and they were poorly pan fried with greasy blobs of cheese inside .   Crab cakes, flavorless, colorless and with mushy breading. Veggies on the side were pretty but tasteless. .  Soup was bland, ok but wasn't from scratch, it tasted like Sysco prepared all of the sauces here.

The appetizers were ok but the Andora chicken with risotto was undercooked and soggy.  The drinks were pretty good but it was very hard to get the attention of either bartender.  I was a bit surprised to see how inattentive 2 bartenders could be on a busy Saturday night.  One older bartender was catering to the rowdy drunk group that included a drunk grandma.  She also left a tray of glasses sitting right next to us the entire time. The younger bartender was going on and on about her baby to a different  group of (uninterested) guys. It was a very unpleasant visit that will definitely be our last.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined here with my parents on this beautiful Sunday evening around 5:30pm. We had reservations for the patio, which were absolutely not needed since we were the only table sitting outside. Once my boyfriend and mom kept being eaten alive by flies- or some other insect- we understood why no one else was seated on the patio. First off- the atmosphere....the beautiful gardens in the back with the fountain surrounded by flowers is just gorgeous! Such a serene and peaceful area. We were all quickly brought glasses of water and greeted by Kristy, who provided friendly and efficient service throughout our dining experience. We began with a bottle of Malbec- an excellent bargain at $30! We were brought bread and seasoned oil- which was delicious- while we perused the menu. Since I had heard they are well known for the crab cakes I went with that entree, which came with rice pilaf and mixed veggies, however I substituted asparagus instead. The good: the crab cakes were mostly meat with hardly any filler and were quite large. Also the onion caper sauce provided a sweet and tart compliment to the meaty cakes. The bad: the sides- the rice was flavorless and the asparagus flavorless and well undercooked. My dad and boyfriend both had the salmon, served with a teriyaki glaze, rice pilaf and asparagus. The consensus was the same on the rice and asparagus: flavorless, very bland. My dad enjoyed his salmon while my boyfriend also did, with the slight complaint it was undercooked. I did see part of his salmon and must agree with him- more on the medium rare than medium side. My mom ordered the walleye with a citrus sauce and same accompaniments. She enjoyed her walleye and was in agreement with the rest of us on the sides. We ordered dessert- two orders of the warm brownie with vanilla ice cream, caramel, chocolate, and nuts. This was the highlight of the meal for all of us but it's very hard for a dessert like that to not be absolutely yummy! Overall, I enjoyed the main part of my meal- the crab cakes- so I'd be eager to return and try some of the other dishes that received rave reviews!",

I normally go for the seafood; any of their grilled or seared fish is worthwhile.  The tuna is personally my favorite, it's melt in your mouth kind of tuna.  Crabcakes come with baltimore style large chunks of crabmeat and is easily.  I have heard they have a pretty awesome back porch during fair weather months.",

The land is more industrial than anything, but you wouldn't really know when you're out on the patio, green lush surrounds you.  The food wasn't that great. The best thing was the calamari for an appetizer. I had the crab cakes with rice and veggies. Absolutely no flavor. So bland. Was veggies with butter and rice with butter, nothing more nothing less.  Would go here if I wanted a nice patio and okay appetizers. But wouldn't suggest going for a good entree.",

The service is impeccable, waitstaff and bartenders are extremely friendly. The food is always on point. You can never go wrong with any of the appetizers, especially the ahi tuna, zucchini, or crab cakes. The bar is an extremely relaxing atmosphere to enjoy some cocktails and an appetizer at the end of a tough day. If you are there in the summer, make sure to check out the patio, I see why it's been voted one of the best outdoor dining spots in Pittsburgh. It's a never miss for me and my friends.",

The location is very convenient, right off the highway but in a wooded area (not sure how bad the bugs are in the summer).  The facility is clean and well-kept.  Dining rooms are beautifully decorated, fancy but not too fancy.  We were there at 6:00 on a weekday and they were near full capacity.  Not chaotic though.  A wide range of clientele, business people to families with kids.  So as nice as the place was I would not go there for a romantic dinner that required quiet conversation.  Here's where it gets weird.  Our server was brimming with attitude, she was way beyond having a bad day.  She was dismissive and rude.  This ruined the whole experience for us.  The food was quite good.  The menu is stocked with basic fare with flare, everything we had was above average in quality.  I would not repeat due to the terrible attitude of our server.",

The back porch had a roof over it but it also had steps which led to a small enclosed back yard with more tables and a beautiful water fountain.  Lily was our waitress, very personable and attentive- always a plus! We started with the Calamari and Chicken Flatbread. Both delicious! The Calamari had an Asian sauce with it, mmm.  The Chicken Flatbread had about seven pieces! It said good for two but you could honestly split it with three to four people.  I stayed simple after our appetizers and had the Shrimp Bisque Soup and Strawberry Fields Salad.  The Shrimp Bisque was good. However, it had two large shrimp in it. I was fully expecting shrimp in the soup (obvi) but it was two randomly large pieces of shrimp ...with tails included... just unthawed and thrown in the soup. It was odd but didn't change how delicious the paste was.  The salad was good, very good. It was topped with Feta cheese, strawberries and sugar coated walnuts plus it was mixed with a balsamic glaze. Hit the spot.  The prices are a bit high. Entrees are anywhere from $20 to $35. I would recommend for a nice romantic night out.",

For those who don't want to get all dressed up and head to a fancy restaurant but also want to avoid the Eat'n'Park type places this is the place for you.   Having been a loyal customer for years it is clear to see why Andora has a cult following of loyal customers. The menus change seasonally, but aside from the nightly special there tends not to be too much variety. The food that they do have is prepared well 90% of the time. (There are nights when you can tell the chef is a little off but those are far and few between).   The ambience is \"dressy casual\", but you can literally see people in jeans and tshirts seated next to those in dressier attire. It is a nice family restaurant (provided your kids are at least somewhat behaved), but it is also a nice date place as well. If you call ahead they are excellent with larger parties.   In the winter they have the fire place going, in the summer the patio is gorgeous. It is a very good year-round place to eat, and I would highly recommend it.",

Comes with a red onion caper sauce and very little filler; which is a bonus when you actually get crab in a crab cake !  Great tasting too.

Hubby had the steak & portabella mushroom ravioli.  While he did like it; it only came with 6 ravioli and that was not enough for him.  Topped it off with bread pudding that came with cinnamon ice cream on top and caramel sauce.  Superb!",

Let's just say by the time the bartender got to us we had to order food immediately and they never came back to me for a drink order (their loss).  It made me kind of sad.  One of my girlfriends had a bridal shower here and the staff and food was great, I was kind of disappointed with the service we recently received. Will I come back? Sure, but with the other food options with better service it'll probably take me 6 months or so.

Very bland and the addition of pecans seemed out of place with what was served.  I got a steak and portobello ravioli meal that was good but I expected a little more food. They were great but 5 small ravioli just seemed a few too short.  My wife got a chicken dish with numerous small pieces that were dry and chewy.  She elected to get he sauce without tomatoes so perhaps they add a significant amount of taste but otherwise it was quite bland as well.  We chose to pursue desert elsewhere.",

We sat out on the patio, which was a treat.  We were dressed a little casual from our hike, so that was a nice option to sit outside.",

It had a great mix of greens and the perfect amount of dressing. The crabcake was definitely different from what I've had before.  It wasn't crunchy but more so creamy. Delicious either way!   The ahi salad was quite a bit bigger. The tuna was cooked perfectly and very tasty! The salad had a horseradish dressing on it which was surprisingly good especially because I don't like horseradish!  We sat on the back deck. It was absolutely adorable!  There was a very nice back deck area as well as a rock garden area with tables!   This place would be a great spot for date night! I will definitely be going back!",

My fiance and I go on Valentine's Day and they get a great 3 course meal special so definitely check this place out for Holiday's where they offer this type of special! The service is great and all of the staff is always super friendly! They have a cute patio area outside off the of bar for when the weather is nice too.",

The hardest part will be not ordering exactly what I got last time!  The zucchini appetizer is to die for (pictured) and I can't imagine anything could make it better.  I got the chicken penne with pine nuts and spinach and it was everything I wanted.  My friend got the trout special which also looked amazing.  The waitress, who was amazing and so personable, didn't rush us at ALL and noticed we were celebrating my birthday so told us to pick a dessert. She was super sweet and I hope she's there when I go back!",

    "text": "We were visiting the Pittsburgh area and drove by this restaurant, saw the back patio and turned around.  The parking lot was full that night so we figured that there must be a reason for that.  We sat at the bar until a table on the patio opened up.  I had a glass of their sangria.  It was one of the best sangria's I have had (other than my own).    Our server, Rebecca, was lovely and attentive.  She brought out fresh hot bread with their house dipping oil.  It was delicious and she cheerfully offered to bring us more when we finished it.  The rest of our food came out quickly.  We ordered the zucchini ribbons which is a house specialty (we can get calamari anywhere).  They were very tasty and we really enjoyed them.  My bf had the rib-eye which had a nice sear to it and was cooked perfectly to his liking.  It was one of the best steaks we have had in a very long time.  I had a craving for pasta. The spicy seafood pasta (which was just a little spicy) did the trick.  We were too full for dessert.    The restaurant has a homey comfortable feeling inside, if a little dated, but it is the huge back patio that is the standout.  It's the perfect place to be on a warm summer night.  I am sucker for those little string lights which were all over the patio.  The landscape was also lovely and we felt like we were dining in a secret garden.  We loved it and when we are back in the area again, we will surely return.",

I also over heard the other table next to us complaint about their calamari saying it was rubbery and just plain old not good. We got the sliced zucchini app. It was bland to say the least. I got the surf and turf for 43$. The steak was correctly but came with a giant and I mean giant glob of butter on it. It was still quite bland. The crab cakes were even more bland. No flavor at all, although I will say nice large lumps of crab but very little flavor. My mashed potatoes were luke warm at best. My husband was a little more pleased with his food. He got the Kona frosted pork and said it had good flavor and was cooked correctly. His mashed potatoes were also luke warm.    Overall subpar experience in my opinion. Definitely not worth the cost. I don't mind spending money on food that's worth it, this place just isn't worth the cost.",

Anytime we see restaurant discounts offered on Living Social, Groupon, etc we take advantage of the opportunity to save a couple bucks on our next visit.  Tonight we were fed a story about how the PA LCB just so happened to be in the restaurant this very same day and informed the staff that they are not allowed to discount liquor sales. We later called the LCB and they stated there is no such rule.  The issue that I have is that we purchased the discount coupons under certain rules and regulations at time of purchase. These are factors in the decision making as we often pass by on offers that do not include beer and wine sales. The Andora's offer had no such stipulations.  The staff were offensive and embarrassed us.  We will not return to Andora's and recommend the same to you.  Now excuse me while I make a sandwich.",

    "text": "We had fun here the other night.  Annie and I sort of last minute met up with Dave and Megan here on Tuesday night for happy hour.  I was trying to think of somewhere convenient to Cranberry (Dave and Megan's home) and the city where we spend our time.  I've been to Andora a few times...the last time for dinner and always thought it perfectly acceptable, but not quite fine dining.  The bar scene is much more fun.  The restaurant interior itself is quite intimate.  There are white tablecloths flattering lighting and the tables are close, but still provide enough privacy.  They also have a back deck that I'm told is a lot of fun, but obviously we couldn't try it on Tuesday due to the \"snowmageddon\" we are currently experiencing.  The bar is a bit of a contrast from the warm and subdued small dining room.  It's a relatively big bar for the size of the restaurant with a couple of TV's, some hi-tops and relatively full given the weather.  The folks seem to be mostly local ranging from 30's to 70's.  The bartender was a lot of fun (Jimmy) who certainly is a professional.  It's clear this is what he does for a living and seems to have a lot of fun.  He did this trick a couple times where he lit part of the bar on fire and then using his finger picked up the flame and blew alcohol over the flame creating a huge flash of blue for the whole bar to see.  He also made a relatively stiff whiskey coke on a cold day.  Dave and Megan were there when we arrived and we were all seated at the bar.  The drink orders were taken quickly.  Annie and Megan had a glass of wine and Dave and I had a couple of beers.  The wine Annie ordered seemed okay for a house wine.  My Guinness was poured properly.  We settled on a few apps'.  Annie and Megan had the wedding soup, which was a pretty large portion of homemade soup.  It was pretty good, however somewhat under seasoned.  Annie also ordered the flatbread of the day.  It is supposed to serve two, but quite frankly it was much smaller than a personal pan pizza.  This was okay, again not that memorable.  The crust wasn't crisp as it should be for thin crust pizza and the cheese could have been cooked a bit longer.  Dave ordered the ahi tuna tataki, which was probably the best thing we tried.  The tuna was fresh and good quality served at the right temperature.  The wasabi was especially strong which I like.  I also ordered the crab cake which is probably one of their signature dishes.  It was excellent.  There must be some type of connection between \"willow\", \"andora\", and \"Monterey bay fish grotto\".  They all have great crab cakes that seem to be made exactly the same.  I'm not sure what the \"damage\" was because Dave graciously paid the tab.  This is a good spot for better than average selection and quality of bar food in a nice atmosphere with good people.  I certainly would be happy to have a sit down meal here again, but I think the bar scene and probably the outdoor dining is the reason to visit this spot.",

All in all though great food and will be back soon hopefully to sit outside",

Great outdoor patio seating in good weather with a beautiful large fountain and flowers and plants surrounding outdoor tables.Had two wonderful meals, scallops cooked to perfection and delicious walleye with a great light sauce. Their crabcake are the best in town. Nice wime selection but also reasonable corkage on BYOB. Nice friendly staff. Great spot for a special occasion dinner and reasonably priced.",

    "text": "I was excited when I found Andora because I am always looking forward to trying out new restaurants. The menu and prices seemed reasonable. We went to Andora about a year ago in December. The place is decorated like we should be in the early 90s eating a formal dinner with family. The menu and food was good but my complaint was the service. Yes, I will admit that my spouse and I look young but we dine out more than most people and are well traveled. I found the server and staff to be stuffy and did not feel like an appreciated customer. I will not go back for that reason alone.   I would like to give them one star but feel that wouldn't be fair since the food was decent.",

So, I found this place and I'm glad I did! From the staff to the food it was amazing!! I brought my grandmother here for dinner and we had the crab cake appetizer, she had the chicken with crabmeat and I had the goat cheese ravioli. I only eat seafood but she said her chicken was done perfect and finished almost all her meal. My ravioli were amazing, I was very curious about how the goat cheese would be and it was great. Very flavorful, I ate the whole plate it was the perfect portion! Kudos Andora this place will be on my top list! I already told all my friends who live locally to go here for their next night out!! Next time I'm home ill definitely be in! Next time I hope to try and leave room for dessert!",

    "text": "The food was good enough. The server was nice and helpful. The host who sat us pretty clearly didn't want us there. I'm guessing it was because my children, ages 2 and 3, were with me but I can't be sure. They have a kids menu and kids cups so probably they're ok with having kids there, but he was not at all welcoming. He barely looked at us, waved us to a table by the door, didn't give us menus, and made it pretty difficult for us to get his attention to tell him that there was someone else's glass of water and sugar packet sitting there. He moved us to another table- right beside the door to the kitchen- so basically the 2 worst tables in the building. Eventually our server brought us menus. She was surprised we didn't have them already. My sauteed chicken was average, but I have high standards for chicken so that could be me. My kid's chicken tenders were removed from the oven moments before being technically burnt. They were really dark brown. The food took a long long time. My kids are actually pretty well behaved but I was starting to feel like the food was taking so long I should no longer be held responsible if they lost their minds. They didn't quite lose their minds but the food taking so long really was a problem. So, overall... The food was ok, that host was taking excellent care of other guests so he's not all bad. Just don't go there with your small children.",

    "text": "Off the beaten path, on Mt. Nebo road, you will find Andora's.  A friend at work told me about this place and I had to try it.  She said it's one of her favorite restaurants.  \"Best crab cakes in Pittsburgh,\" she said.  We'll just have to see about that, I thought.  Don't be fooled by the exterior, inside the dining room, while formal, it's warm and cozy.  Windows are covered with formal flowered valances and blinds, tables are covered with white linens and cream colored napkins, complete with fresh flowers.  We were seated near a fireplace.  The tables are all a different angles, so it still feels intimate.  Wood wainscoting covered the walls and also the angled ceiling in our dining area.  They have a nice wine list, but we opted for our favorites drinks.  Bread was crusty and fresh from the oven and served with perfectly seasoned oil dipping sauce that included sun dried tomatoes.  Me and my friend Robert decided to share a Cesar salad.  The salad was very good.  Served with a fried crisp of asiago cheese and a hard slice of toasted bread for the crouton, the salad included marinated tomatoes.  Delicious!  Since I heard so much about the crab cakes, I opted for the Turf and Surf, which was an 8 oz. filet mignon served with a crab cake.  Both were delicious, the crab cake had no filler and was served with red onion caper sauce.  The steak was very thick and perfectly cooked.  Sides were green beans/baby carrots and mashed potatoes served with bacon and cheese.  The potatoes, while very yummy, were not much to look at.   The veggies were very yummy.  Robert had the salmon teriyaki.  He's very nice, he shares, it was very good!  Perfectly cooked.  For dessert, we shared a huge thick slice of cheese cake drizzled with a raspberry puree.  It was very creamy and smooth and served with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.  Service was warm and friendly.  Not crowded, but busy, we went on a weekday night.  Very nice meal.  Other items on the menu included scallops, pasta dishes, pork.  Looking forward to summer, the patio looks very nice.  Don't forget, they serve lunch.  Parties of 6 or more require reservations.",

    "text": "Andora catered my wedding this past year. My experience was extremely poor.    Management: During the 10 month planning process, I dealt with 3 separate catering managers, either b/c the previous one had quit or was fired by Andora management because they were not competent enough to handle the job. Each time I got a new catering manager, I had to re-explain the vision for the wedding down to every last detail. As busy as I was during my wedding planning, this seemed like something that should have been captured by the company and passed to the new staff. The new catering managers were not even quick to contact me when taking over my account even though my wedding was within weeks.   Food: During our tastings, the food was excellent. I was nervous that the change of management would affect the plate decisions, but was assured that since it would be the same chef, our food would taste the same at our wedding. Unfortunately, we were let down. Most of the food was only luke warm, and the vegetarian meals were complained about, stating that they consisted of only zuccini on a plate.   Payment: Through all the confusion of changing management for our account, an original contract was never signed. After asking countless times (nervous about their fulling their commitments during our wedding), we finally were able to sign a contract stating specifically the itemized cost of the services Andora would provide. The night of the wedding, the newest catering manager handed my mother a bill as we were packing up. The total cost was $10,000 more than previously negotiated. Although the catering manager tried to have my mother give a credit card on the spot, my mother said she would review the contract and call with a credit card number the next day. The next day, my mom found out from Andora that the owner decided that her contract was not valid b/c it was not a standard contract they used in the company, (recall: his staff gave it to us). When questioned about the difference in cost, they blamed one of their incompetant ex-catering managers for mispricing many items and then told us they expected us to pay for their employee's mistakes. When we tried to compromise by splitting the difference, the owner threatened to involve his company lawyers. On top of that, they charged the credit card in the midst of our dispute, without our consent. In the end, they ended up giving a few percent off the difference and we covered the rest, eager to just put this behind us.   Summary: Andora has good food at the restaurant, and the 3rd catering manager did seem to want to please us, but due to their company policies, flakey management staff, unequal quality of catered food, and poor general customer service, I would not recommend this vendor for any bride who wants to be sure her wedding planning goes smoothly.",

    "text": "I was here for a special occasion, and must say that it was not what I expected.  The menu offers a wide variety of options, but you should be sure to ask your server what they suggest as in small restaurants like this they typically know what is better to order.  I got a steak here and was not impressed.  While it was cooked to temperature, the steak was dry and was lacking in seasoning.  For the price, I've had better steaks at Atria's or Bravos in the area.    My girlfriend got the crab cakes, which were great.  I recommend these as an appetizer or an entree.  Our server was knowledgeable, but she could have known a bit more about the wine list.  That being said, I must mention that they have $20 bottles (A decent variety) that offer value to their customers.  I would go here again and steer clear of the steaks. I feel as if my experience would have been better if my server would have suggested a better entree.",

Their two young boys were with us and understandably got a little fidgety and cranky. When the entrees finally did arrive, my steak, which was supposed to be cooked medium rare, was basically seared and raw and mostly gristle and fat.  Pretty unedible.  We were considering taking my nephew's mom here for her seventieth birthday but have taken this place off our list of prospects.  A very disappointing  experience.",

I had the veal dish, which ended up being very tough overcooked veal with a lousy gravy ( almost tasted like store-bought ), overly salted mashed red potatoes, and 4 pieces of undercooked Asparagus. My guest ordered a Chicken pasta dish - and it was pretty apparent from the taste and consistency that the chicken was from frozen inventory. It really had the taste of freezer burn. For the price that was charged for each dish, I expected much better quality.",

It was a busy Saturday evening, but they were willing to take the time to learn... and make... a drink that was new to them as long as they had the proper ingredients or suitable substitutes.  The wait staff was attentive but not intrusive.  But the food... well, it was just average.  Their signature dish, a crabcake, was tasty- lump crab meat, good seasoning, limited breading.  However, their main courses were basic in construction and flavor profile, lacking visual and taste contrast.  I had the chicken salitmbocca with parmesan risotto.  I simply could not distinguish between the flavor profile of the risotto and the saltimbocca sauce.  In the end, it tasted more like chicken fried chicken with bland country gravy.",
