As a side note, the table in the front offers a truly nice view on the street. Johnny is an excellent server, extremely knowledgeable and kind. I truly appreciate waiters that know their menus and Johnny definitely does. The three dishes we tried were the pheasant and the beets as our starters. The only thing better than the taste was the presentation. We shared the duck as our entree and the chef kindly split the dish onto two plates. The texture of the meat was exquisite with a perfect medium rare cook. Chef Andrew is a True artist and cook. This restaurant comes highly recommended.",

    "text": "I stopped by here two nights ago for my birthday dinner with my wife.  The Twisted Frenchman was my choice because I had been eyeing up their tasting menu for awhile but at $90/person it seemed like too much of a splurge for a normal evening out.  I made the reservations through the Yelp app a couple of days ahead of time and had no problem getting the 7 PM time that I desired.  My wife and I ended up arriving at the restaurant about 10 minutes before our reservation which wasn't a problem as we were immediately seated at a table along the wall which was fairly private.  The inside of the Twisted Frenchman is actually decorated quite nicely in a simple manner with grey tablecloths and napkins and a large decoration in the center of the ceiling consisting of a bunch of cylinders of glass that were in different colors and sizes.  After being greeted by our server and having water served to us, I asked about the tasting menu and then noted that I had allergies to chocolate and red wine.  Our server didn't seem to think that was going to be a problem and so we both ordered the tasting menu.  A couple of minutes later our server came back out to ask me if it was ok if the chef cooked some of my food in red wine since it will cook off.  I explained to him that it wasn't and he went back into the kitchen and I knew it wasn't good whenever he came back with the regular menus.  He explained to me that the chef couldn't cook enough dishes without red wine and so we would have to order from the a la carte menu.  What kind of chef is unwilling to accommodate someone's food allergies?  I have never had a problem with this before and at most chef's tastings they have actually asked me if I had any allergies so that they would not make something that i can't eat.  Apparently this chef just didn't feel like making an effort that night.  The server proceeded to then point out three appetizers and two entrees that I could actually eat and noted that I could also have the steak and lamb entrees but without the demi glace.  Interestingly neither of those items even mentioned a demi glace on the menu.  Since at that point the menu was so confined for me, my wife and I left the restaurant and used the $200+ we were planning on spending at the Twisted Frenchman to have a nice dinner elsewhere.  The bottom line for me is that I will never come back here again in the future and would advise others to avoid it as well.  What kind of a chef can't make dishes whenever they are handicapped by a single ingredient?",

For all those foodies most interested in discovering a delightful encounter outside the personal kitchen, the Twisted Frenchman is the ideal restaurant.  My husband and I have travelled most of the major cities of the US + Canada and find The Twisted Frenchman to be on par with the best of all we have experienced.  To give some credibility to that assertion, have dined at Per Se, The French Laundry, Topolobampo, Jean-Georges, Daniel Boulud, Emeri's New Orleans.  Our dining experience @ The Twisted Frenchman was superb - the foie gras was exquisite.  Filet of Beef was just perfect {melted in the mouth & done perfectly \"rare\"}; the Grains and Asparagus was interesting with multiple textures.  Everyone at our table had ordered differently from the 3 course menu and everyone was of the opinion that the Twisted Frenchman was really special.  There were so many flavors, textures, tastes, and appearances in each beautiful presentation - the server was very attentive and informative.  AND it was quiet so we could actually have a conversation - we loved that aspect.  Dining at the Twisted Frenchman will remain a wonderful memory of all that is good about dining out - Pittsburgh is so fortunate to have a restaurant on this level.  Everything about this restaurant brought a smile  - a restaurant of this level definitely requires revisits - IT WAS TRULY A GRAND EXPERIENCE!  Thank you everyone at The Twisted Frenchman for simply said \"just doing everything right\".",

Unfortunately, there was a mis-communication and the first course came out with a scallop, but there were no other issues. Allergy sufferers, double-check your food.  That said, the food was generally outstanding, particularly the smoked salmon (reminiscent of Alinea's smoke pillow plating) and the lamb-wrapped lamb chops. I would come back to eat both of those dishes again, and I almost never order the same thing twice. Everything else we had was also quite solid, except for dessert. I know liquid nitrogen is exciting and everything, but it has been done a lot and so desserts using it should stand on more than just the theater. The chocolate mousse was not particularly remarkable, and the vanilla custard was nicely flavored, but a bit of a letdown after such an exceptional meal. If TF steps up its dessert game, I will be there for each season's tasting menu.",

Our group of four went to the Twisted Frenchman last weekend for dinner to celebrate a birthday. From the moment we were seated we felt unappreciated by both the restaurant management and wait staff. Our waitress must have been either overwhelmed or simply didn't care about our dining experience. The food which had previously been incredible was now just dropped off at our table cold as though we were an after thought. When we inquired about dessert options we were told flatly that we don't serve that anymore. Unfortunately all good things come to an end and now so has our love affair with this establishment.",

    "text": "If you're looking for an excellent fine dining experience in the East End, The Twisted Frenchman is absolutely worth a try.  My friend and I went on a slow, stormy, Sunday night. We looked over the menu, which was largely meat-based, but were very intrigued by the custom vegetarian entree option. We ordered the beet salad and a soup as appetizers, and each got the vegetarian entree. Apparently, there is a multi-course vegetarian tasting menu available as well, if you want to go the full mile.  Both the soup and the beets were excellent. I often joke about \"New American\" restaurants and their beet salads. Like, you're not a New ____ restaurant unless you have a damn beet salad on your menu. And it has to have a drizzle. And be served on a rectangle. However, this was like... the best of those beet salads I think I've ever had. So, I couldn't even crack my jokes.  The server was very friendly, and helpful. He knew when he was needed and when to stay away, answered questions with accurate detail and impeccable memory skills - even on the two vegetarian entrees. He also worked on talking with the chef in helping us select a wine that would pair perfectly with our dishes.  Then, the entrees came out. The chef *could* have made us both the same thing, but didn't. Each was customized according to a list of ingredients of foods we didn't care for (the list was short). My memory isn't as good as the server's, but my dish was some sort of delicious carrot polenta puree cake which had a nice hard texture on top, and was delectably smooth in the center - think sort of like creme brulee. It was over a bed of ratatouille, and was surrounded by all sorts of yummy treats, a few sauces, and a balsamic reduction drizzle. It was superb.  My friend's dish had a really excellent green (pesto?) sauce, fresh gnocchi, vegetables, and, well, I forget at this point. It was equally excellent. However, we both agreed that we liked our own dish the best, so somehow that worked out well.  Dessert was an adventure. We got both desserts, and didn't regret that decision at all. The chocolate mousse has a special surprise preparation at-table, and an amazing combination of textures (again, sort of like creme brulee). I was in heaven.  The decor of the restaurant has been very much stepped up from when it was Notion. Now there is actually art and decor, and the seating isn't one giant wall bench. It feels more intimate, warmer, and thought out. It feels like somewhere you'd get a nice meal - not like a hotel restaurant afterthought. The hanging dried flowers are a bit strange, but, its better than blank beige walls.  After dinner, we went to the kitchen to thank the chef, and ended up chatting with the entire staff for a good 10 minutes or so. They were all very friendly, receptive, and excited to share their vision with us.  I absolutely recommend this place. Yes, its a bit on the pricey side, but I'd rank it over Spoon or Salt in quality - with an experience very much like Root 174.",

    "text": "Looking over my profile, it's been a long time since I wrote a review. My dinner last night at The Twisted Frenchman, though, was so extraordinary that I absolutely had to drag my password out of my memory and share my experience.   So, do you miss the creativity and showmanship (without \"showiness\") of Kevin Sousa from his special menu at the Bigelow Grille days? How about the precise French execution of Laforet? And what about the amazing flavor profiles and quality ingredients of Bona Terra? Well, you now have no reason to miss any of those things, because The Twisted Frenchman has all of that, and more.   First, the decor and ambience. It's hard to believe that this place was once Royal Caribbean. The overall style is much the same as it was during the notion days, but it has been amped up a few notches so that it feels just a bit more elegant and a bit more intimate. You can still clearly see when other diners are receiving their food, and hope that amazing-looking dish is coming your way soon, but there is enough of a degree of separation between the tables that you can just focus on your dining companion(s) instead, if you wish. The music choices fit the restaurant well, too, and the service is very enthusiastic. Our main server had also had many of the dishes we tried, and spoke about them knowledgeably and avidly.  The star of the show here, though, is the food. We each had the tasting menu with the wine pairings, and that was absolutely the right choice. There were a number of dishes on the regular menu that almost tempted us away from that, but they ended up showing up on the tasting menu anyway, so that worked out well. The tasting menu is expensive for Pittsburgh, but would be considered a bargain just about anywhere else (and it is totally worth the price). The portion sizes for each of the courses was just right - we felt very satisfied at the end of the meal, but not like we were going to explode. The wine pairings were also well done, as were the sizes of the pours - it was enough wine to induce frivolity, but not sleepiness.  I enjoyed every course, but the four standouts for me were the salmon, foie gras, sturgeon, and duck. The plating of the salmon was a fun bit of show, with a classic modernist cuisine presentation (if that isn't an oxymoron), and the feel of an updated bagel-and-lox. The flavor of the salmon was beautiful, both on its own, and with the accompaniments of the roe, everything bagel, and creme fraiche-cream cheese. I normally find smoked or cured salmon either to be a bit overwhelming with salty or smoky flavors or to be too bland or \"fishy\" with not enough curing for the size of the salmon portion, but the thickness of the salmon cut for this dish was absolutely optimal - it was a great blend of smoke and sea.  The foie gras was also perfectly portioned. If I remember correctly, I believe that the brioche on the bottom is toasted/fried in duck fat? In any event, the foie gras was sized and seared so that it balanced the richness of the liver with a caramel sweetness. The red onion marmalade and balsamic glaze on the plate provided a nice, sharp counterpoint to that, as did the yeastiness of the brioche. Each component of the dish was ideally sized to balance the others.  The sturgeon was cooked just right, and the carrot-grit base was a nice pairing with the sort of chicken/halibut flavor of this fish. It's rare to find sturgeon on a menu, but I will definitely be keeping an eye out for it now! The grilled pearl onions, and tiny asparagus tip and tomato combined with the fish and carrots to really feel fresh and summery. (Incidentally, our server told us that the sturgeon was ethically raised, which was nice to know.)  Finally, the duck. It was, again, cooked perfectly, and combined with the ratatouille and the grain salad, the flavors felt like the type of homey dish that you could have in a farmhouse in rural France on a rainy day.  The elegant presentation, though, wouldn't be found in many farmhouses, nor would the foie demi poured over the top. In a word, wow.  This review has turned out to be rather long, and I think I used the word \"perfect\" about a dozen times, but The Twisted Frenchman absolutely deserves every bit of praise. In summary: go! Go now! Order the tasting menu, and have a meal that you won't soon forget.",

    "text": "This is probably the best restaurant dinner I have had in Pittsburgh, after having lived here for almost 20 years.    Went with spouse. I ordered a smoked salmon that came under glass that had been filled with smoke.  This lent the smoked salmon--you guessed it, its smoky aroma.  The presentation was excellent and the effect of uncovering the transparent glass cloche and releasing the smoke was very cool.  My wife had the beet salad, which was amazing.  The beet salad actually had beet \"dust\" sprinkled on the plate as garnish.  The important part of this is the this isn't a case of Molecular Gastronomy for the sake of gee whiz effects.  The appetizers were delicious in addition to being neato.  For entrees I had Sturgeon cooked sous vide, and my wife had an agnolotti with truffles.  I have never been a big sous vide fan, but it was well done here as the protein was really only the canvas for the wonderful sauces and foams that carried the day and which provided all of the flavor.  The tender fish just added the right heft and mouthfeel to bring the dish together. My wife's agnolotti was even better.  Her dish was delicious and had awesome shaved truffles on top.  From what I could tell, it was made straight up using conventional cooking techniques, and did not rely on anything gimmicky--it helps to have shaved truffles on top.",

    "text": "So the food was pretty good, not great for the price or compared to other restaurants that do chefs tables or tasting menus. If I had to rate it just based on food it would be a 3.5. The downfall was our waiter who's name was Brian, he was unfriendly, never asked us how anything was or if we needed anything. I've never been to a restaurant on this level where a waiter just brings a check without asking if you needed anything else, for example a coffee or an after dinner drink. He was a huge bummer for our New Years dinner. The dinner came out to $435 with tip for a six course meal and we could've gotten better service and a more pleasant experience at Applebee's.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner and had a wonderful time. French food is not exactly the most veg-friendly, but I had a great experience here.  The wine selection is amazing. I had an experienced person at the table, so I didn't get the chance to see their sommelier in action, but the list itself is already great.  For the first course I had the beet salad, which had a combination of roasted and pickled beets that I really enjoyed. It was over a magically whipped goat cheese (goat cheese + beets = perfection).  Then for the main dish I requested the off-menu veg item. They asked me if there was anything I liked, and anything I especially hated. I told them my one hated thing (star anise/fennel type flavors) and they came back with a gnocchi in a rich mushroom sauce. The gnocchi was unlike any I'd ever had, made from pastry dough as opposed to potato. It was like eating air. I loved it.  There are only two dessert items, but they both are pretty great. I'm not a foam fan, but the bubbles in the citrus dessert are actually amazing. Also, of course, the chocolate mousse with the liquid nitrogen \"crust\" is pretty amazing. Mostly I enjoyed having the chef come to the table and chat with us while he put the finishing touches on it.",

    "text": "We were excited to try this restaurant, but were terribly disappointed. The only option for the evening was the chef's tasting menu (3,6,8) We opted for the three and were able to sample six items available since there were two of us.   1. Foie  gras | pheasant reduction blah blah fancy words. - the foie gras was good.  - The pheasant stuff was broth with a pastry hat. The broth was good, but pastry tasted odd. Even my bread loving husband passed. There was a surprise quarter sized rubbery meat at the bottom.  2. Chicken truffle blah blah fancy words | lobster tail fancy saucy description - chicken was dry, sauce was ok  - the lobster was really mushy, the claw was so slimy that I had to spit it out into a napkin - the fancy green sauce was bitter and the potato was more like paste When we told them that it wasn't very good, the shock seemed to be overwhelming. After the total surprise that people didn't like the main course it seemed they really couldn't have cared less.   3. Dessert, the highlight of the meal... was very good. Cheese plate & creme brulee -   The wine pairing was essential in getting through the meal. The Bar Frenchman made great cocktails. Basically anything that chef had little or nothing to do with was great.  Thanks to The Twisted Frenchman my husband has banned me from picking restaurants. I blame Open Table, as the restaurant was highly recommended.  I do wonder if we were there when they had a regular menu if it would've been a better experience, because this restaurant has mostly good reviews.   Maybe chef was having a bad day. But....   The whole restaurant was eating the same thing... like a wedding and you know how that food goes.",

    "text": "Second time in. I can't say enough to praise the excellent sourcing and creativity! The favorite this time: the lamb-wrapped lamb. It was savory, delicious, and skillfully prepared to a perfect medium-rare. If they're not cooking this a la sous-vide, I'll eat my hat. It's a perfect example of how to cook lamb.   Another stand-out dish: the sturgeon. Who else serves sturgeon in Pittsburgh? This dish really shows-off the kitchen staff's skill: they take a typically under-utilized fish, and make it shine.   I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK!!!!!  We were lucky enough to get a table on a Sunday night and we could not be happier. The food was delicious, the staff was kind and attentive, and the space was warm and inviting. We enjoyed two French reds from their thoughtful wine list, one Bordeaux, the other a Chateauneuf-du-Pape. I enjoyed amazing steak tartar, the pheasant consomme, and the aged strip steak. But, the show-stopper was the foie gras with brioche, onion marmalade, and nut butter. It was like the best PB&J you could imagine.  What an amazing meal!!",

    "text": "This is another relatively new Pittsburgh restaurant (a year or so old) that I've wanted to visit for a while.  I tempered my expectations but entered with an open mind.    It's a small space, so reservations are a must.  While we were seated I saw at least three parties turned aside who had walked in with hopeful gleams in their hungry eyes.  No soup for you, last-minuters...boyscout up next time.  We did the chef's tasting menu complete with wine pairings, and while I swear I was sober when I left, I can't remember half of them.    There were bright spots: My absolute favorite of the evening was the Foie Gras  Onion, Marmalade, Nut Butter, Balsamic, Brioche (from the menu).  The waiter told us that it was the chef's take on PB&J, and if that's the case then I wish the chef was packing my lunch because I'd eat that every day for the rest of my life.  The accompanying wines were also great.  And I can't complain about the Tawny Port that accompanied the dessert because I don't like port regardless...so toss that.  The plating.  I can't think of another restaurant in the area that pays as much attention to plating as this one.  It was beautiful.  Often better than the food itself.  Originality.  There are a lot of great flavor combinations and ingredients that you aren't likely to find elsewhere.  I like that.  I like trying new things.  I liked the use of liquid nitrogen to \"freeze brulee\" the dessert, or the palate cleanser, for example.  New and different can be a fun little food adventure whether it ends up being amazing or bombing.  Which I guess brings me to the less bright (but not deal-breaking) spots: There were a couple courses (the cured beef and the beets for example) where the plating wrote huge checks that the food itself was unable to cash.  Not that it was bad.  But I had hoped for better.  All in all of the 8 courses I'd say two (the foie gras and the tartare) were excellent.  The rest (including the aforementioned original dessert) were good, but not five-starrable.  Wait staff seemed knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.  Space was, as previously stated, intimate.  Decor...\"original\".  See other yelpers' pictures for the...napkin-wrapped, fish hook suspended dried flower arrangements...  Good date venue.  Good venue for an evening with adventurous foodie friends.",

    "text": "What a lovely evening from start to finish.    I most highly recommend the lamb, which is wrapped in lamb sausage that's even better than the lamb itself. High marks also for foie gras, which comes served on a brioche that somehow managed to be the star of the dish, even when competing with something as delicious as foie gras.  Bryan had the beef carpaccio, which was very delicately flavored.  He gave rave reviews to....a fish dish that I don't recall because I don't eat fish and don't know skate from piranha.    Dessert was pretty awesome, featuring the chef freezing the top of the chocolate mousse with liquid nitrogen.  I almost wrote something about the portion being huge, but if I'm in a place where I'm complaining about too much chocolate mousse, life is good.    The wine list contains a nice range of prices, which is a bonus because the food is verrrrry pricey.  The portion sizes lend themselves to eating both an appetizer and entree, which can quickly become an expensive proposition.  So while I had an amazing experience here, it is more of a special occasion restaurant for us.    Also, a shout out to the amazing staff and particularly manager Danielle, who recognized me from a restaurant where she used to work and treated us like royalty for the rest of the night.",

    "text": "Went here for restaurant week, so I can't comment on the full experience. For $35, got an appetizer and entree. I chose the foie gras and Rohan duck, while my dining partner tried the potato leek soup and the truffle agnolotti. We also split a bottle of blah wine for $60 and the frozen chocolate for $12 for dessert. As a plus, complementary baguette from la gourmandine!  I loved my duck dish, it was a great texture and flavor and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was a sizable entree and I was definitely full from it. I wasn't fond of the foie gras, it was served with a marmalade which overpowered the normal flavor and made it really sweet. I also tried the truffle agnolotti and maybe I'm just not a truffle person but I thought it was a very overpowering flavor. The soup was delicious and might have been my favorite part of the meal.  The frozen chocolate was quite a show. A rich chocolate brownie with strawberry puree and blood orange sherbet came on one plate. The chocolate mousse came out on a separate plate and the Chef poured liquid nitrogen to freeze the top layer. It was an interesting mix of flavors, not bad but not mind blowing. I actually thought the frozen component took away from the mousse, other then it being a good show. The frozen parts were a little too hard to eat and tasted kind of icy while the nonfrozen parts were good.  The space is really small, and surprisingly not very decorated. Plain walls, no artwork, one large modern chandelier piece. Overall the food was good, but quite pricy. I wish the dishes were more consistently mind blowing and I wasn't in love with the wine or the space. I suppose a place like this is really set apart by its chef tasting menu, which I'd love to try one day.",

The beets were freaking amazing. I actually got in trouble for taking too long to eat the beet dish. (See service below.) I wish all plates came with that little line of goat cheese. The foie gras was fine. I'm not a huge fan, but it had a nice, buttery finish, and the nut butter gave it an interesting dimension. The salmon was perfectly sous-vided (it's a word!), and I loved the lavender flavoring. Coming in second place only to the beets was my exquisite duck main course. Perfectly cooked. Great sauce. The (gluten-free) lobster hush puppies on the side were eh. My husband LOVED his Wagyu beef. Period.  Dessert: Yes, liquid nitrogen is super fun. However, after it floated away, my dessert was basically chocolate pudding and vanilla ice cream with citrus fruit. I'm gonna need a little more than that.  Service: The service impressed us at the start of the evening because although my husband had called ahead to secure a gluten-free version (of course) I threw a curve ball with a \"yeah, I also don't eat read meat so I'd like to skip that Wagyu beef part.\" I told them it was unnecessary to edit, and that I was happy to skip along to dessert, but the servers and the chef insisted. They did a super fast pow-wow, checked my prefs and double-checked my allergens (yes, just the wheat) and came up with a replacement main course on the fly (well, an hour-ish later). WOW. Awesome and thank you!!! After we ordered our drinks, a beautiful dance commenced with dish upon delicious dish delivered to our table. I will say that some of the servers clearly enjoy/understand their job more than others.  Unfortunately, two things happened that undermined the goodness. One, we didn't know that we were under the gun to finish our meal! They had scheduled the tables exactly two hours apart so about an hour into dinner we were informed that we were eating too slowly and that we had to hurry up to make room for the next seating. I'm don't get much time out alone with DH, it was Vday, and I had multiple courses of delicious food to eat so I though the speed was ok. The staff made me feel like I was being rude for taking the time to enjoy my evening. Two, as they rushed us through to the end, my gluten allergy got overlooked, and our desserts had to be remade. Eek.  Overall, we enjoyed the food and would return. However, we'd want to know exactly how much time we had to eat so we could plan accordingly!",

    "text": "4.5 stars rounded up.  Just got back from a fantastic dinner at the Twisted Frenchman for Restaurant Week (which by the way, is one of the more \"worth it\" dinners during Restaurant Week!).  I started with the potato-leek soup with a dollop of creme fraiche and a wonderfully roasted maitake mushroom. The soup was poured table-side (love it!) over the other elements. The soup was lightly creamy, warm, and that maitake mushroom -- sooo good.  For my entree, I got the salmon. The salmon was perfectly cooked, served atop some whipped (?) potatoes and a sauce, along with some braised leeks. This was a fairly standard but well done dish.  My friend, on the other hand, got the agnolotti as her entree. It was stellar. The pasta was perfect, the sauce was great, and the truffles -- oh, the truffles -- they were so satisfyingly savory. I will remember this dish and come back for it.  We ended on the frozen chocolate dessert. The chef/owner himself (Andrew) came out to carefully pour liquid nitrogen onto the chocolate mousse portion of the dish and explain anything we wanted. After all the liquid nitrogen, he cracked open the top and mixed it with the rest of the chocolate mousse. So fun! This was all served next to a chocolate cake sitting on top of a strawberry puree and topped with a cara cara orange sorbet. The chocolate mousse was nice and the frozen part melted in your mouth but was a nice change in texture. The cake (brownie?) was a bit dry and the strawberry puree was not really my thing, but the sorbet was nice and overall the dessert was worth it for the experience more than the flavor. The presentation of each of the dishes was truly spectacular, and it definitely added to the fine dining feel of things.  All in all, solid dinner. The service was attentive, knowledgeable, and pleasant (thanks to Roy and the rest of the servers that helped us out!), and the food was pretty good to amazing. If I could critique anything, maybe the decor/lighting/signage could use some work, but honestly, that would not keep me from coming back here for another great meal.",

With only 6-7 tables, the ambiance is intimate and relaxed. The wait staff were a blast, introducing each round with anecdotes to build our anticipation.",

We ended up being late for our reservation but the staff was still able to make the night enjoyable even if we couldn't do the chefs tasting.   I started dinner off with a Ginger Pear drink and it was delicious light and refreshing. A perfect starter drink. For my app I went with the Tartare. The flavors were amazing and the presentation was fun. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. For my main dish I went with Bordeaux Marinated Duck. It was hearty and perfect on a cold November night. The ratatouille that it was served with was my favorite part of the dish. Also worth noting is the wine that accompanied it. It was a perfect combination. For dessert I had their frozen chocolate which was not only scrumptious but came with a bit of a liquid nitrogen show. The balsamic vinegar reduction put an interesting spin on the dessert. To accompany it I choose a LBV Port. It was a great combo. The service threw out the evening was impeccable. Every dish was explained when it was brought to the table and I never felt like I was sitting around waiting on service. I can not wait to return and hopefully try the tasting menu next time. Needles to say it was a very good birthday.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here from my birthday dinner on January 9th.  We're very open and love to explore new food.  (Sorry, picky eaters, but this may not be the review for you)  We got the 8 course Chef's Tasting, and I got the additional wine pairing to go with it.  This was my first time actually doing a wine pairing with my meal, and I absolutely loved it!  I'd be surprised if every wine pairing is done this well, but if it is, I wish I could eat every meal this way.  My husband had 3 of their specialty cocktails and loved those as well.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable and seemed about as excited about the food as we were.  I don't think we could have asked for better service.  The meal itself was wonderful.  The presentations were creative and gorgeous.  It was basically like eating art.  The only dish my husband and I weren't huge fans of was the sturgeon.  The way it was cooked made it taste a little fishy in our opinion, but neither of us are too experienced when it comes to sturgeon.  I've seen other reviews raving about this dish, so it may just be a matter of opinion.    We've done tastings before, and have sometimes left feeling like we could still eat or might be hungry again in an hour.  Overall, I'd say that this restaurant it well worth the money.  We definitely left full.  My husband and I make a point to try at least one (usually two or more) new restaurant(s) each month- something we began when we first started dating, so we do have a lot to compare to.  This may very well be my new favorite restaurant in the city.  I'm excited to come back and try individual things on the menu, and hopefully one day make it to a Chef's Table (14 course tasting).",

What I thought was really cool was they put liquid nitrogen on certain drinks and foods, which created a fun effect. They used it on The Frenchman drink and chocolate mousse to freeze their \"frozen chocolate.\" Everything we ordered was delicious and unique...smoked salmon, white bean soup with soft shell crab, the duck, and gnocchi. The staff was friendly and gave a short explanation of what was on the dish that they put in front of you. The chef even came out to present the desserts to us. I would strongly recommend this restaurant for fine dining. The restaurant is small, so I would strongly suggest making a reservation.",

You'd have to get to Memphis to have anything even close.   Creamy with a shrimp that pops in your mouth and a crispy oyster so light my fork had to hold it to my plate.  I could have eaten 2 of them if I had the room.  Portions are generous and you won't leave hungry.  My entree was a mouthwatering sirloin steak beautifully presented.  It was so tender.  The dessert was unbelievable.  A chocolate mousse that on its own was wonderful, but Chef Andrew froze it at the table-and Bang!  A frozen ice cream.

I understood what they were attempting to accomplish with the decor but it misses the mark just a bit. We ordered drinks, my husband the manhattan and myself the Frenchman. My drink came out smoking from dry ice and was accompanied by an explanation of how I needed to wait to drink it. Really? I care how the drink tastes. I don't need a show. My husband had the soup as an appetizer, which we both agreed was the highlight. I ordered the scallops. They came in two preparations with one under a dome with applewood smoke. I've experienced similar at other restaurants (not in the burgh) but was getting suspicious of the show.  For $30, I was genuinely expecting more amazing flavors but this dish fell a little flat. My husband ordered the duck and I ordered the lamb. My lamb seemed to be ever so slightly under done and I actually found its accompaniments to be more exiting than the meat itself. The flavor of my husband's duck was much more interesting than the lamb. We finished with the \"vanilla\" dessert. Of course, more dry ice and instructions. Uncle! It's on the verge of being gimmicky.  Just give me amazing food. I don't need a show. For the overall price and quality of food, it wouldn't be my first choice again, but I am glad someone is trying to do something a little different in Pittsburgh.",

The atmosphere is on the stark side .. nothing on the walls and the tables are fine, not overly comfortable chairs though.  The booths seem to not fit in with a higher end place.  They didn't have table cloths and I noted one patron complain that for her birthday she thought she was going to a finer establishment but there were no other places for her to sit.  I kinda of agree that sitting at cloth tables were nicer.  The music was very upbeat and funky.  I think its all lending its name to \"twisted\". ;)  The ordering was fine.  The waiter was capable.  The food was very good although both our meals came out almost room temperature and it was cold out so we didn't like that.  Chef came out for the carnival of liquid nitrogen show .. he quite loves doing it and its fun.  It was expensive.  The wine by glass was $9-15.  I think our bill was toping out at $195 with tip!  This was two appetizers, two entrees, sharing one desert, having three glasses of wine and that's it ...  that's kind of .. twisted.",

Our first time there, we had an excellent meal from start to finish, with fish and chips appetizer (it's not what you're thinking of), delicious pasta and vegetarian entrees, and a unique chocolate mousse dessert. The food at our second visit didn't seem as inspired as on our initial visit. The fish and chips appetizer was very good but not great. My wife's vegetarian dish, a cassoulet, wasn't as tasty as the roasted vegetable dish she had ordered before. My salmon was very good, though. Food presentation was superb both visits. The wait staff was quite attentive and the service was quick. Appetizers were in the $15 range and most entrees were in the lower 30s. With the small entree sizes, you'll want to get an appetizer with your meal. Also, be aware that parking can be difficult since you have to fend for yourself with whatever street parking is available. For the price, I'd pick Casbah just a short walk down the street.",

    "text": "We visited last night, and it was certainly a memorable experience.  This restaurant is beautifully decorated, from the choice of a beautiful shade of aqua, to the stunning chandelier, to the touches of tiny, delicately wrapped bouquets of dried flowers suspended from the ceiling by invisible wire; tasteful whimsy is everywhere.  I had a cocktail to start and then a glass of champagne with the foie gras, which was very special.  Perfect brioche topped with slivered foie gras and an onion jam.  Every bite was perfect.  And then I had the sturgeon, which was butter-poached, and it was amazing.  First of all, visually, the dish was gorgeous.  Every garnish is thoughtfully placed, and while there were smears and splatters of sauce on many dishes, none seemed gratuitous.  To tell the truth, I very much wanted the foie gras, and I just couldn't follow that up with a main course of meat, and since the sturgeon was the only seafood option, I chose it by process of elimination.  How much I loved it was a wonderful surprise, and it really was the perfect choice.  It is the kind of dish where you think that you know what to expect and what it will taste like, but then you have a bite that is so flavorful and bright and surprising, but nothing is overwhelming; I really did think it was perfect.  If I were to go back soon, I'd have a difficult time choosing different dishes, though I'd force myself to do so.  My husband had the risotto to start, and it was sublime, which is a word I don't think I've ever used before.  He followed that with the lamb, and it was so wonderful.  It really had such an interesting texture and it was delicious.  Our friends had the sturgeon and duck, along with foie gras, and though I didn't taste the duck, they loved it.  The four of us ordered the chocolate desserts, despite the fact that we all originally wanted the vanilla custard.  When the waiter (who was great) described the chocolate dessert, we all changed our minds.  It was fun and magical, really.  We saw others order it, and even though you sort of know what to expect, it is still special and wonderful.  This is just a different sort of place than what I'm used to.  My favorite restaurants are usually the ones where you're getting great food, but the atmosphere is dark and relaxed and a bit noisy.  I didn't know if I'd love the formality of a fine French joint, but I was wrong.  It really did, for me, hit all the right notes.  I am grateful for a near perfect evening.",

Our server was good and that is about the only good thing I can say. The food on the other hand was mediocre at best given the price tag. The sturgeon was tasteless and am pretty sure has given me the worst case of the runs I have had in years. The lamb dish came out completely uncooked and raw on the inside taking the concept of farm to table to a whole different meaning. When my husband sent it back, it came back rare. I could barely watch him try to eat it without having to suppress my gag reflex. The only other thing that was decent was the chocolate mousse dessert, which was prepared with liquid nitrogen at our table. I wondered about the safety risks and thought the server seemingly pouring of the liquid on to his hand was unnecessarily gimmicky. Given that in the lab scientists use protective gear to handle nitrogen in liquid form due to the risk of frost bite and burns, I thought the downplaying of the risks associated with liquid nitrogen was an attempt to try too hard to compensate for mediocre or worse food. Trying to get us to focus on the smoke that is created from when liquid nitrogen tuns into gas, so that we could forget about how bad the previous courses were.",

From the way we were received by Yannick, to the Ruinart for our guests, Twisted Frenchman has become our go to place! We all had the four course menu and as it was a special occasion, Chef Andrew Garbarino added some special touches which included a lemony sabayon topped with caviar and fresh chips: his twist on 'chips and dip' and a creamy squash grits with truffles. Some highlights: Squash soup- enough sweetness, delicious  Pate de campagne- just what you can expect in France, a good balance of sweet and savory  Trout boudin- it's more in the form of a trout cake, very tasty Carrot barley risotto- I absolutely loved this! It's a clever play on macaroni and cheese with no cheese and no pasta.  Foie gras- the signature dish and simply perfect  Filet- two of our guests had it, perfect cooking, tender and the sauces were very flavorful  Poussin- woah! Wonderful flavors, great combination of sauce and truffle stuffing Desserts- just enough sweet after all that food!! Espresso- perfectly hit the spot  If you're on the fence because you think you'll leave hungry or it's too expensive, just try it. I will be back and will continue to recommend!

    "text": "My interest in this establishment started with the name.  I enjoy French restaurants, and this one was apparently named after a Frenchman who is twisted. Twisted how?  Is he a scary sadomasochist who lures naive diners into his restaurant with his delicious food or is he simply a contortionist who dabbles in the culinary arts?  After surviving a wonderful dinner here without any psychological or physical trauma, I can assure you that he is neither!  Instead, The Frenchman is a gifted chef who puts his own twist on French cuisine with his talent, skill, and a little weird science.    We made an early bird reservation through Yelp, and were the first patrons of the evening, well maybe I should say I was the first patron.  Parking is a b#%*h!! in this area so my husband dropped me off and had to park far away at one of our favorite retailers (sssh!)  While I waited for my mister, I received a pleasant greeting from our server who provided a menu and wine list for my perusal and did not laugh when I chose a glass of wine I could not pronounce.  Once my mister hiked over, we discussed the tasting menu.  We did not have time to do the 8 course because we had a show to catch, but there was time for the 3 course. Unfortunately for me, my husband was not a fan of duck as the main course.  So no tasting menu for us :-(  but I did order duck as my entree :-) and he ordered the prime strip. For starters, I ordered the melon and prosciutto salad.  It was cool and refreshing.  And the presentation was so pretty, I could not recognize the type of melon.  My husband ordered a tomato bisque soup.  It was thick and rich, and came with an elaborate piece of dipping bread--it could have been a meal all on its own.  Next our entrees arrived, also impressively dressed up.  And the taste?  My duck was nothing but delicious!  And needing another drink, our server recommended a smooth Boudreaux that certainly made my duck quack.   For dessert, there were only two items listed, and the description looked/sounded rather plain. I presumed it was simply ice cream, and I was a little disappointed.  Thank goodness, I was sooooo wrong!  Our server explained the dessert in greater detail, and the layers of flavors sounded so interesting, we ordered one of each--the VANILLA (custard, citrus, blood orange) and FROZEN CHOCOLATE (orange sorbet, strawberry).  Then out come these platters with our dessert and the weird science show begins!  Equipped with a container of liquid nitrogen, our server pours it over our desserts and we sit in a smoky haze watching it instantly freeze up.  As I was still in awe of my newly frozen dessert, our server intentionally spills the rest of the liquid nitrogen on the floor and our toes all get frost bitten!  Just kidding, about the frostbite.  But there really was a spill on the floor that took me by surprise, and was quite fun to see it evaporate into smoke.  The size of the desserts was generous, and so delicious, we had no problem cleaning our plates.    Service was prompt and attentive, the environment intimate and relaxing, and the food wonderful.  Quite a memorable meal.  If I am lucky enough to visit Pittsburgh again, would definitely like to return for the 8 course tasting menu.",

    "text": "Took me a while to get around to writing this review, but after dreaming about the amazing food for the umteenth time, I decided it couldn't wait any longer.  So, my girlfriend and I came here for the New Years Eve 8-course prix fixe dinner (yeah, this is almost 2 months overdue). We also ordered a bottle of the Cidre Bouche Omaha Beach champagne, which was rather disappointing (but not disappointing enough to prevent me from downing the entire bottle by myself).  We're not from the Pittsburgh area, so we chose this place based on the zany name and the Yelp reviews/pics. We were a little reluctant to pay $100 per person without any idea of the menu, but we got our money's worth and a whole lot more.  I will say that the dinner got off to an inauspicious start with the amuse. According to my foodie girlfriend, it did not qualify as an amuse, being much too substantial. An amuse is meant to be bite-sized whereas this was an entire bowl. Of course, I wouldn't be complaining if it were good. My girlfriend was obsessed with introducing me to foie gras and was horrified at the prospect of my first taste coming in the form of some freeze-dried foie gras shavings.  The next course was an oyster with caviar, and was also very weak. I chalked up my dislike to me not being a big mollusk fan in general, but my girlfriend normally loves oysters and she hated this course.  At this point we wondered whether our $300 wouldn't have been better spent on...well, just about anything. But alas, there were 6 courses remaining for the twisted frenchman to redeem himself, and redeem he did!  If I recall correctly, the next course was a beautiful mixture of red and yellow beets prepared 3 different ways: raw, roasted, and in chip form. The beets were sitting on a smear of goat cheese and the two went perfectly together.  The next course was beef tartare with foie gras pate and snail caviar. Every element of this dish was immaculate. My girlfriend finally got the caviar she had been craving and I enjoyed foie gras for the first time (spoiler alert: it wouldn't be the last of the night).  I'll briefly mention that other courses included soup, squab, and sturgeon, and each was phenomenal. Unfortunately, my fading memory prevents me from further singing their praises.  Now without further ado, I'll move on to my favorite course: the classically prepared foie gras on brioche with caramelized onion jam. Let me tell you, this was the best thing I've ever tasted! I think I even did that weird thing where I closed my eyes to better savor each bite. I'm officially a fan of foie gras and my girlfriend couldn't be happier.  The final dessert course was relatively unremarkable, but we were both so stuffed that we didn't much care. Worth noting was the cool little dry ice demonstration our waiter presented at the table. The meal ended with two dark chocolate truffles which we had to bring home.  The dining room felt very intimate and the service was top-notch. Our waiter brought us complimentary glasses of champagne at midnight and seemed to be in no hurry to rush us out the door. All in all it was a truly unforgettable experience.",

We started with the grilled baby aubergine which came under a glass dome filled with applewood smoke!  The aroma was delightful and the dish tasty!  But my favorite course was the second.  It was a piece of foie Gras with a cube of brioche toasted in duck fat with balsamic vinegar decorative lines and some onion jam...oh man!  Third delicious beef...now they offer prix fixe for 8, 14 and 21 courses and I'm sure that each would be just as wonderful as we had...the dining room is elegant and comfortable.  You can have a real conversation with your friends.  The wait staff was charming and helpful...no rush, have a celebratory meal, enjoy yourself like a grownup!  Oh, and the wine list is excellent.  I did the tasting pairing...each was just right!  All in all, one of the nicest meals I've had in Pittsburgh...thank you, Twisted Frenchman, for a lovely evening!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to The Twisted Frenchman for our anniversary. The wait staff was very friendly and we were greeted immediately. The ambiance in the room was very nice. We both elected to try the 8 course tasting menu, and we were so glad we did. The meal started off with a squash soup that was incredible! Followed up with veal shoulder pate that was very good and came with the most incredible mustard I've ever had. Next up was trout boudin with smoked squash. Then foi gras over brioche with a pine nut butter. Neither my wife or I like liver, but I was honestly surprised at how good this dish was. Next was a barley risotto with carrots 3 ways and this was so good! The depth of flavor and richness in the dish was surprising. That was followed with seared monkfish over charred leek with confit cherry tomatoes. This was hands down the best fish dish I've ever had in my life! The fish was meaty and sweet like lobster. The charred leek paired extremely well with it and the tomatoes were incredibly sweet and added just the right note of acid to the dish. Next was duck breast with rutabaga puree, crispy Brussels sprouts, and a pate creme. Now I've personally never liked duck breast much. Rare fowl is not really my thing. But this was probably my favorite dish of the night. The duck was so tender and the charred crust on the outside made me feel like I was eating a well seasoned filet mignon. The rutabaga puree was crispy on the outside and soft inside and was a great compliment. The crispy Brussels sprouts leaves were salty and wonderful on top, and the Demi glas drizzled around the outside was delicious. Last was dessert and we chose the lemon mousse and the hazelnut chocolate mousse over hazelnut brownie. Not being much of a dessert guy this round of a meal never excited me, but the chocolate hazelnut mousse was sublime. A wonderful way to end the meal. All in all one of my favorite meals I've ever eaten and I wouldn't hesitate one second to go back",

    "text": "Service was very attentive and nice.  Wine pairings were delicious and balanced but EXTREMELY small.  This is where the positive ended for me.  Food is average to me, dishes lack acidity and balance.  Execution is not consistent.  More than one dish was sent back.  Scallops smelled slightly old, not the most fresh.  Lamb rubbery and extremely over cooked. Sous Vide is a great tool, but too much is a bad thing and when it is used to simply save time or have faster execution at service you miss the pleasure of the ingredient you are trying to enjoy.  Salmon was the most odd preparation of the evening and the beets were rock hard, almost raw.  The temperature of my food was warm at best, the plates were not even heated properly.  Portions extremely small....much smaller than many 2 and 3 star michelin restaurants that i have dined within.  French Laundry portions are fine when you are dining at The French Laundry for 9 courses plus amuse bouche and multiple desserts and bread service.....but i have never ever left a \"fine dining\" restaurant hungry until tonight.  I felt like i had three appetizer sized dishes and a very small dessert.  At this price point i would expect much more attention to the small details.  Where are the amuse bouche?  Bread service throughout dinner?  Final sweet bite or small pastry to take home?  Warm greeting and goodbye from front door hostess?  When we left the restaurant no one was even there to say goodbye?    We were celebrating an anniversary and nothing special was included for the evening, not a complimentary glass of sparkling wine, hand written note, extra dessert, nothing?  Every upscale restaurant i have been to will always provide a small something extra to make the special evening more memorable....apparently not here?  The food however was the biggest disappointment.  I would have expected much more from a restaurant listed as one of the best in Pittsburgh.....maybe Pittsburgh still has a long way to go?",

The 4 of us also had dessert. Our bill was $500 including the tip and all of us left hungry. That's insane. We have eaten in the best restaurants all around the world and never spent $500 and left hungry. In fact, on the way home, we stopped and ate sushi at the best sushi place in Pittsburgh, Little Tokyo. I love to go out to eat to fine restaurants, as a matter of fact, we do it every weekend. But I feel his old place around the corner was better because you could pick what you wanted off of the menu. Now this place has 3 or 8 course menus. The 8 course is a surprise so you don't know what you are getting and with the 3 course you get to pick each course by getting a choice of 3 things for each course. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "What a pleasure it was to dine at the Twisted Frenchman last night.  We were celebrating the Wifes birthday and I don't think we could have picked a better place to enjoy the special occasion.  We were running late due to traffic and they were MORE then accommodating given our tardiness.  If I could give this one six stars I would.  We started off some house cocktails, I opted for their version of a Black Manhattan.  It was strong, although slightly sweeter then most.  I for one appreciate that.  For an appetizer, I went with the Pheasant.  It's served with Duck Confit, Black Truffle, and a Puff Pastry atop.  Next to the dish is hay with a ember burning in the middle.  The scent of Pennsylvania fields filled the air and it instantly took you to the home of the hero of the dish, the Pheasant.  I love how they were able to incorporate all of your senses into the dish like that.  The puff pastry on top was so delicate and fluffy, it really brought everything together.  I went with the Lamb for my entree.  I also ordered their signature cocktail, the frenchman.  The drink was served with liquid nitrogen still bubbling in the glass, filling it with smoke and chilling the drink.  It features St. Germain, a french liqueur, along titos vodka, lemon, and Green Chartreuse.  Its light and refreshing.  The lamb chop is wrapped in lamb sausage, and served atop a brie stuffed onion with a Concentrated Carrot on the side.  It's then topped with a red sauce served table side.  Everything was of course spot on.  Juicy and tender, cooked to perfection.  The spice of the sausage combine with the flavor of the lamb steak in a wonderful way, i was very satisfied with my meal.  For desert, I opted for the Vanilla Custard served with blood orange.  I also went with a french white wine that I didn't catch the name of, but it was as sweet as ice wine and very good.  The custard was served over a bowl of vanilla sugar that had liquid nitrogen poured into it table side.  The smoke that rose was filled with the smell of the vanilla.  They also did a table side chocolate moose, that was covered by a table side pour of liquid nitrogen to freeze the top layer, then crushed up to provide different textures of the hard frozen top pieces inside the still soft creamy inner moose.  Overall I was really impressed with the Frenchman.  The attention to every detail with the incorporation of rising scents and the fun that table side gastro brings really made the evening special.  My compliments to the Chef, and also to the very attentive staff, for a wonderful night.  Next time I visit, I'll be doing the 14 course chef table, and although I was just there last night I already cannot wait for it.",

Located on the second floor.  Service is excellent!  Menu is neat in that you can choose number of courses you would like 4 or 8 were the options we were given.  Expectation that everyone at the table have the same number of courses.  We did 4 course option and it was enough :) in case you were wondering!  They also do optional wine pairing if you like.  Each course had 3 options which were diverse enough for anyone's palate - mixture of vegetable/seafood/beef/chicken/duck/pork.  I did potato leek soup, scallops and pork belly, and then filet of beef - dessert I did the chocolate option of course.  They also did a serving of bread with the first course which was nice.  Overall this is a fine dining experience and very on point for the Pittsburgh area!  Chef is rockin' the flavor and the plates are on fleek! Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "New favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! Came here with my wife for a Valentine's dinner after just finding it on yelp as we both like French food. We were both blown away; one of the best meals either of us have ever had!  It's located on the second floor, almost hidden. We have been in the area a number of times and had never noticed the small signs. But once you get in the restaurant it's a really nice ambiance. They great you and take your coat, before seating you in front nice large windows to look out. The service was spectacular with everyone being very knowledgeable on both the food and wine.  We had their 5 course Valentine's week dinner with the wine pairing. Each course was the best version of that item I've ever had. Started out with a tomato bisque soup which was delicious. Second course was an interesting take on Duck Foie Gras on a crispy bread square. Not sure what all was in it but it worked.  For the entrees, we had a lobster risotto with cauliflower in a delicious sauce. Followed by a perfectly cooked beef filet. It melted in your mouth. For dessert, we had a chocolate souffle with a caramel sauce. Each course was perfectly matched by a wine pairing. Even some of the types I don't usually like matched their course perfectly.  Of course there is a downside, this place is not cheap. Our meal came in at over $250 for the 2 of us, so not something you want to do every night. But amazingly, not only did I feel the meal was worth it, I plan on coming back in the future!  Overall, I was amazed how amazing the food/wine was from this restaurant and yet I had not heard about it. If you're looking for a spot for a special dinner, I 100% recommend this place.",

I guess I was expecting a fancier vibe to go with the \"fancy\" food. However, in my book, decorations mean nothing if the food is good.   The food was delicious, beautifully plated, and quite expensive. The dishes we ordered were very very very rich. I'm not huge on ultra rich foods so while my first bites were phenomenal, the remaining got old for me pretty quickly. Also, I got the duck and the hubby got the steak and you'd think we'd get a sharp knife to cut through these meats. While they were tender and cooked a perfect medium rare, the knife we got was way too dull to tackle them. I think we spent the majority of our time there trying to cut up our dinners. I recommend asking if they have sharper knives if you also choose the duck or steak.   Overall, I'd probably rate The Twisted Frenchman 3.5.",

Service was crisp if not overly formal. The night we were there we had a choice between a three-course or an eight course meal. We chose the three-course and finished up with a souffle. Everything was wonderful and it was a pleasant surprise in terms of pricing. I think our entire evening was about $150, which for a restaurant like that is very low.

We got lucky and scored a spot so I immediately opted to take my husband here instead of another place I had booked. So glad we did! Turned out to be restaurant week and they only offered the three courses for $35 (good deal!) . We were able to add an extra foie course. The foie there is probably the best in Pittsburgh. The wine pairings were done very well. Brian was our server and he was fantastic. He really helped make the night memorable. The food was well executed all around.  Only thing to note is no cocktails on Sundays as they rely on their sister restaurant for the bar but they are closed on Sundays. However, their wine selection made up for that.",

I have been wanting to try it, but hadn't had the opportunity - so restaurant week was the perfect time!    Our party went from 4 to 2, unfortunately, but they were very accommodating and understanding - thank goodness.    One thing to note about East Liberty - parking is a PAIN in the bum!!  I was lucky enough to find street parking - but the people at the table next to us left to make sure they weren't being towed out of the walgreens parking lot.  There are PLENTY of signs - however they need to remedy this (this is not a Twisted Frenchman issue - just giving you a heads up about parking!)  Food.  Presentation is amazing and beautiful.  The food - amazing. Dessert (which wasn't included on the restaurant week menu) was the best part of the meal.  Not just because it was scrumptious - but the chef came out and had some fun with some liquid nitrogen.    The ambiance within the restaurant is different.  I expect a \"fancy\" restaurant such as Twisted Frenchmen to be tables - not booths.  But they have 4-5 booths.  Maybe it's for space, maybe not.  It was just a little bizarre to me.    Regardless - I hope to get back to do the 8 course tasting menu.  It was amazing and I look forward to another opportunity to experience it!",

They had five items on the main courses so our waiter was wiling to explain each of them.  I was first drawn to the Elysian Fields which is a lamb chop covered with lamb. I asked what that meant and was told that is primarily lamb sausage. He did tell me it was more sausage so both of us switched to the salmon that came over a type of whipped potato and a Bearnaise sauce.  While we were waiting for our meal he served us some bread. He told us their bread comes from La Gourmandine  which is one of my favorite bakeries. I would assume it came from the one in Lawrenceville since I knew the one in Mt. Lebanon was too far away. The bread was toasted so we took some home with us.  When we got our entree the salmon was melt in your mouth good! Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and offered us a choice of one of two dessert offerings.  We decided to share the chocolate brownie with strawberry sauce and sorbet accompanied by chocolate mousse which a different server pours \"liquid nitrogen\" to cause a \"steaming\" effect. The chocolate mousse comes in a big bowl to spoon out what you want. I truly enjoyed the brownie its accompaniments. Although I liked the mousse it seemed to have melted since they poured that nitrogen over it. It tasted runny since it didn't stay frozen.  They give you a couple of dessert truffles when they give you the check.  Other than that we truly enjoyed a taste of French cooking and will definitely return when the occasion warrants it.",

We were greeted at the door by Johnny, who warmly showed us to our table.  We decided on the 8 course tasting menu with the wine pairings. Not cheap, but well worth the price (the tasting menu portions are smaller than the regular portions, but there are 8 of them. Trust me, we didn't leave hungry). Served with warmth and precision by our waiter Mike, assisted by Johnny and a woman whose name I didn't get.  We started with the Potato Leek Puree, a hearty soup served with a spoonful of shitake mushroom and caviar. Delicious. The followed this up with their Beet Medley, a small number of beets prepared differently, some fired, some steamed and a delicious beet chip. Next came their fried foie gras, perfectly balanced with an onion marmalade and brioche. Both our waiters said this was one of their favorite dishes and it didn't disappoint.  Next was the Steak Tartare, served with homemade chips, Escargot Caviar, Roasted Chestnut and Foie Gras Pate. I don't usually like tartare, but this was exquisite! Next we had some soft shell crab, substituted from scallops (my wife is allergic to scallops). Delish!  The main course was duck with Parsnip, Confit Sweet Potato, Root Chips, Foie Mustard Emulsion. It was served VERY rare, but went down easy. The combination of flavors soared to new heights.   The chef came out personally to serve us our dessert, the Frozen Chocolate. He froze the mousse using liquid nitrogen, right in front of our eyes at our table.  The wines were perfectly paired and always tasted better with the food than on its own.  The staff is excellent and the chef is extraordinarily creative. Every detail was seen to. I recommend highly.",

    "text": "This is the place to go if you're celebrating something special. Or if you want to feel special. Or if you enjoy French food. Or if you appreciate beautifully plated deliciousness. Basically, hurry up and find an excuse to visit this restaurant.   For Valentine's weekend they ran a 6 course chef's tasting menu ($80) with optional wine pairing ($45).  I have to admit I was a little nervous to partake in a meal that's chosen for me. I like carbs. I like cheese. I like ordering off a menu. I like control. But I relinquished control, threw caution to the wind, and I'm happy to report that I'm left with no regrets.   Dinner began with French bread from La Gourmandine Bakery and a yummy thyme butter. Carbs (check)! We were off to a great start.   What followed was a perfectly paced multi-course extravaganza that consisted of:  Potato leek soup with arugula foam-- This is the best soup I've ever had in my life. It was so creamy and so flavorful and I kind of wish that it was served in a barrel instead of a miniature bowl. I resisted the plate lick, but only barely.   Beets with goat cheese mousse-- Who knew beets could be exciting? There were roasted beets, pickled beets, beet chips, and beet dust. All variations were gloriously distinct and delicious.   Foie Gras over toast with nut butter and jam--They call this the adult PB&J. I don't like Foie Gras (it's a texture thing), but I could get down with the flavors of this dish. My husband said if we were millionaires, he'd eat this for breakfast every morning. So there you go.   Salmon with lavender-- Rare salmon isn't something I usually enjoy, but this was good! The lavender was very flavorful and was a great accompaniment to the fish.   Waygu Beef with lobster hush puppies-- I want to write a love poem to this slab of meat. Whoa. Just. Whoa.   Dessert, for me, was a vanilla custard with blood orange and a shortbread cookie. It was plated over a bowl of aromatic sugar (not to be eaten, but to be smelled). My husband got the decadent chocolate French mousse with a brownie. The server brought liquid nitrogen to the table and froze the mousse to add texture. I got a little dab of liquid nitrogen to my bowl too for dramatic effect. The desserts were out of this world.  The drink pairings were also superb. There was champagne, sherry, a fantastic Pinot, some kind of Bordeaux, and a port. I'm kicking myself for not taking note of all the names, because I would like to stock my wine cabinet with everything!   With our bill we got two delicious little chocolate truffles. I also got a beautiful bright pink rose to take home. What a nice touch!   Many compliments to the chef and staff for a wonderful evening. I'm looking forward to visiting again!",

    "text": "When it comes to my birthday, my motto is \"go big, or stay home.\"  This year was no different.  I've been wanting to try the Twisted Frenchman since it opened maybe 6 months ago.  When I learned they had a Chefs table, I knew where I'd be dining for my birthday.  Parking was street only which made it difficult because everything was occupied.  Thankfully we found a spot and made our reservation.  Walking in to this intimate restaurant, we were immediately greeted and sat in front of the window.  The 14 course tasting menu and wine pairing was about to begin and I was giddy with excitement.  I took photos of every one of the 14 courses.  They all look beautiful, but they taste evern better.  For appetizes, the celery root soup was something I never would have thought of but it was creamy and delicious.  Very French!  I also loved the beet salad (what can I say - I LOVE beets).  The watermelon was innovative and smart.  I never would have thought pine nut butter, goat cheese, and caviar would be so delicious.  100% unique!  However my two favorites were the smoked salmon and the foie gras.  The presentation of the smoked salmon was sensory-filled and the bite can only be described as what salmon was meant to taste like.  The foie gras was Chef's play on peanut butter and jelly.  It reminded me of French toast.  Crispy brioche with soft and savory foie gras.  Pine nut butter with red onion marmalade... absolutely incredible!    The entrees were all wonderful... but I will dream of that poached sturgeon with carrot polenta.  It was light yet rich with flavor.  I could have licked the plate, it was that good.  Please do yourself a favor and order this dish and when you go, call me and I'll join you.  I don't know how I was able to consume dessert, but I did... and I'm glad.  The chocolate mousse was light yet rich.  The liquid nitrogen brought a fun presentation and a nice texture to the creamy dish.  Also the strawberry puree, balsalmic drizzle and brownie crumbles made the mousse even better.  The best dessert in my eyes was the vanilla ice cream with shortbread cookie crumbles and blood orange foam.  Ladies and gentlemen, this was by far the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.  BEST. I'VE. EVER. HAD!  Flavorful yet not too sweet - Ben & Jerry's has nothing on this.  The shortbread cookie brought texture and the blood orange foam added whimsy and acidity.  The wine pairings were also perfection.  Everything complemented the meal.  I was highly impressed.  Thank you to everyone at the Twisted Frenchman for an incredible meal.  I will never forget my 33rd birthday dinner.  Though I'm unable to travel to France right now, I look forward to being transported there by my next meal at the Twisted Frenchman.",

First, I am writing about my dining experience at the restaurant on the second floor- not bar Frenchman on the first floor.  I was so excited to try this and it totally beat my expectations.  We did the 8 course tasting menu.  It was so nice to start with a glass of complimentary champagne!  One of my favorite things about this place is they served dishes I would never order and when they came out I was certain I would not like it- for example their beet dish was not appetizing to me at all, they brought it out and I was not looking forward to it.  I LOVED IT!!!! The foie grad dish was also super delicious.  The duck dish they offered was super tasty as well.  8 courses had me full...really full but also wanting more from this restaurant.  I cannot wait to come back!",

    "text": "We went there during summer restaurant week. They treated this event seriously and provided one of the best menus among all the restaurant week participant restaurants. It is located on the second floor on a quiet street. I would say it is contemporary style decor? Anyway, it is quiet and cozy inside.   The food: Foie Gras is a must try. The soft, fatty foie would melt in your mouse. The crispy, salty bread was also a perfect match for the foie.   Sweet pea risotto was a good option too. It was chewy and you would taste a bit of sweetness. The veggie were baked to the right level and tasted very crispy. But I would still vote for the Fioe Gras if you have not tried it.   The lamb was very good, they used shishito pepper to make a spicy sauce that matched surprisingly well with the lamb. I would say the lamb was median well with some red in the centre. The almond on goose cheese was also an interesting complement that gave a buttery flavor.   I would rank Bouillabaisse the last among these four. They used amazing seafood. Just look at how large the shrimp and scallop was. It was also very tender, but I did not taste any interesting flavors that I would remember. The dish tasted like seafood soaked in creamy soy sauce.",

    "text": "Fine dining at its best. We chose the four course tasting menu and wine pairings. None of our selections were the same, so together we were able to sample one half of the menu. Plating was beautifully done, and we both enjoyed our own and each other's food. Service was on par with the price (which is on the high side for Pittsburgh - $65 each for the meal and $35 each for the wine pairings).  I liked that the server explained each wine as he poured it.   Course one:  I had the pheasant and foie pate - very good, and my husband had the variations of beetroot, also delicious.   Course two:  I had carpaccio, which I love and rarely see on menus in Pittsburgh. I enjoyed it, but nothing matches the carpaccio I used to eat at Emilio Romagna downtown years (and years) ago. My husband loved his sweet pea \"risotto\", which he deemed amazing.   Course three: Lamb wrapped lamb for me, which I chose on the server's suggestion. It would not have been my first choice, but it was nicely prepared, and there was actually more on my plate than I could finish (so I shared). Petite pousin was the other plate, and again, is highly recommended.  Course four: Both amazing - raspberry & pistachio torte and lemon delice.   I would love to go back for another special occasion, and would look forward to whatever the menu offered in the future.   Before dinner we stopped at the downstairs bar in Garbarino's and had an aperol spritzer, which was the special of the day. The bar is very nice as well, and Garbarino's menu looked promising for another, more casual visit.",

The complimentary fresh dinner roll was one of the best we've had! The foie gras had the perfect balance of creamy and crispy on toast. I was not impressed with the steak. The flavors just weren't my favorite. Though the dishes were in small portions, I left feeling very content. My husband got the lamb dish and didn't finish it because it was under cooked. I guess getting multiple courses is necessary unless you know what you like. I would definitely come again.",

    "text": "we had the 8 course menu. The soup and the salmon salad were extremely salty. All the other tastes were overpowered with this aggressive saltiness.   The beet root is quite creative. All three ways to cook have their unique taste, but they are not delicious, just refreshing and novel.   The foie gras is a disaster. They tried to use Veniger to neutralize the fatty taste of the liver, but they catastrophically failed, that not only the dishes smells like a broken vinegar jar, the fatty taste did not got tamed but attack your taste bud with the Vineger. The raisen can't do enough to save the dish.   The risotto is the only thing that the did ok tonight. The dish hug you with warm and soft tastes, bring you the only comfort you can have in this place. and the vegitable is just enough to make it whole.   The shrimp and the scallop is ok, nothing special  The steak is ok as well. But they put an eggplant as sides. The raw, disgusting tastes of the eggplant ruined it all.  The desert is ok, standard Souffle,  nothing special.  The service is excellent. Dishes comes a bit slow.  Environment is not quite, around 70 db.",

It was our first time so we decided to go with the 4 courage meal with wine pairing. For my first course I got the tomato soup. It was probably one of my favorite courses. Everything in the soup paired so well together. Second course I got the risotto and it was by far my favorite course. It was to die for! It was full of so many different flavors. For the 3rd course I got the salmon. I was a little disappointed after my first 2 courses were so good. It just fell a little short of my expectations. It didn't have as much flavor as I anticipated for the main dish. For the last course I got the lemon mousse. I'm a sucker for lemon so it was a no brainer.   On top of the food being awesome, everything else about this restaurant was phenomenal. The presentation of the food was great. The decor was beautiful and the restaurant was very quiet which was a nice change of pace from the typical crowded restaurants. The service was amazing! We didn't like the wine pairing with our dessert and they happily swapped it out for something we would enjoy.   I would highly recommend The Twisted Frenchman to everyone. I can't wait to go back and try their new fall menu!",

    "text": "Delicious food!! We have been wanting to come here for almost two years and we finally did! There are four different tasting menu options: 4 course, 8 course, 14 course and 21 course. We went with the 8 course.   Every course was absolutely delicious. The presentation of each dish was very creative and thought out from the actual food on the plate down to the plate itself. My favorite courses were the squash soup, foie gras, duck breast and dark chocolate hazelnut dessert.  The one dish I wasn't crazy about was a fish dish with endive. It was a 7 out of 10 and all other courses were a 10 out of 10 in my opinion.   Two of the people in our group did the wine pairing as well. You got a different glass of wine (both white and red) with each course. The pours were very generous. The price of the pairing ($50) was reasonable and definitely worth it if you enjoy wine!  Several different people wait on you. There seemed to be some confusion with the staff and they got their wires crossed a few times. It seemed like this was just an off night and not a pattern or problem for them. Everyone was very nice, caring and knowledgeable!  You are able to make reservations on Open Table.   The menu changes seasonally. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Best Pittsburgh restaurant and I can tell this place deserves Michelin star. As soon as I came into the second floor I remembered me of on of the best restaurant in USA called Alinea located in Chicago - IL. (Chef's table - second season - Netflix) The leek soup was the best soup I ever had in my whole life. Sublime and delicate. The decoration of this course also reminds Grant's Achatz's style of Molecular Gastronomy.  The second course was a sophisticated combination of risotto and rich colorful vegetables. It's a perfect match of softness of risotto with the crispy vegetables over the rice.  Third course was the most tender chicken I have in my life. It's melts in my mouth. It's like a thigh cut in a half but with no bone at all. Incredible delicious. You'll want to lick the other side of the plate - lol!! Lemon pie was a little too sweet for me considering that this restaurant style offers the truth of each element. They don't hide or change the taste of the ingredients with strong spices or sauces, the chef just let it be: which means you taste what it's each element of your meal as it's. This chef really knows what he is doing and knows how to combine colors, textures, taste to the perfection.  And the service definitely can be compared to a Michelin restaurant: very attentive without to be disturbing when it's not necessary. It's pricey but it worth the elegance of atmosphere and the sophistication of each \"master piece\".",

I especially liked the steak although the portion was too small. The dishes were pre-determined so no choices were offered except for the dessert. The reason that I don't give 5 stars is the price. You normally expect a high price for such a restaurant and meal. However, still, I think that it was overpriced. Yelp should assign four $ signs to this restaurant. Tip: you will spend at least 2 hours for a 5-course meal. So, this is a great restaurant for a date or romantic dinner, especially if you like to chat for a long time and are sure that you won't need to leave early. And if you do not like music to interfere with your conversation. This place lacks any kind of music. I would recommend a light one though.",

    "text": "Spectacular!!  We have enjoyed the wonderful food at the downstairs Bar Frenchman, but jumped at the chance to book a table for the Twisted Frenchman when we learned of their special week-long tribute to the life of the legendary Chef Paul Bocuse! The special menu was made up of delicious twists on Chef Bocuse's signature dishes, and is clearly meant for diners with a refined and experienced palate - it was full of delicate yet flavorful dishes, and I must say that it was one of the more enjoyable meals I have had.  They greeted us warmly and made sure we were comfortable and welcome, right from the start. Chef Garbarino came to the table to present our first course, his take on the legendary pheasant consomme en croute. The delicate flavor of the superbly balanced broth was highlighted by the fragrance of the small amount of straw which had been lit and extinguished - it gave the dish a nice bucolic feel, and was delicious.  The second course was foie gras, served on an exquisite slice of brioche and seasoned with pistachio butter and passion fruit puree. It reminded me of his take on seared foie with peanut butter, but this version is so light and savory/sweet, I must admit that it favored my tastes even more than the already delicious aforementioned version. It was hard to not go crazy and scrape all of the delicious pistachio butter off the plate with my knife... and into my mouth.  Third course knocked it out of the park - a butter poached lobster with caper puree and sauce Americain. The delicate, velvety texture of the perfectly poached lobster balanced nicely with their sauces, which were tasty enough to stand as perfect flavors on their own. The marriage of the pairing could not have been more delicious. I'll admit, I looked around the room and considered licking my plate for a moment to have the outstanding flavor of this dish linger just a little bit longer. Don't worry, I didn't do it... (I almost did, though.) I was very pleased when Chef told us that he is seriously considering a version of this dish for their regular menu - this dish alone would keep me coming back for more.  The truffled chicken was also a home run, for sure. I almost never order chicken when I dine out - except at French establishments. My love for the concept of \"poulet roti\" is deep; so deep that I have a rotisserie attachment for my grill at home. Whenever I can, I order this type of dish to see if the establishment is able to make something so deliciously simple taste so amazingly savory and comforting. I am pleased to say that the sous-vide chicken breast, stuffed with black truffles and then roasted gently to perfection was amazing. I found it interesting that Chef would use two very different, almost opposite techniques to finish the chicken breast, and unlike another reviewer, found my dish to be moist, flavorful, and delicious. The morels filled out the savory sauce's flavor, and matched nicely both with the chicken and with the smooth potatoes and glazed carrots.  We had a tasty beaujolais sherbet, finished with nitrogen, as a palate cleanser, and then embarked on the delicious ending of the meal - a wonderful cheese plate, followed by a velvety smooth blood orange creme brulee. I wish we could have done the wine pairings this evening, but alas - it was a \"School Night.\" I enjoyed a nice glass of Sauternes with the foie course, and a tasty Gigondas with the rest of the meal, however. Chef and staff were all warm, friendly, and genuinely interested in our comfort throughout service, and we can definitely see why so many folks give this place rave reviews.  Thank you Chef and all at the Twisted Frenchman, you have given us Pittsburghers a refined option for satisfying our desire for elevated, innovative cuisine. We most certainly will be back, and I promise - I will keep trying to resist licking my plate with each delicious course.",

We're not big wine drinkers, so we passed on the wine pairings. I had few a cocktails, and my significant other drank a couple of beers.  Coming in, we had heard rave reviews of this place, and it met expectations. So why only 4 stars, I'm grading on a curve. With high expectations going in, the Twisted Frenchman would have needed to be an experience, an event, a truly spectacular extravaganza to warrant 5 stars. It was a fun time for sure, but it did fall short of a 5, but not by much.  With the 8 course meal, you do not know what you will be eating. It is all a surprise which was actually something we liked. Your server asks you if you have any dietary restrictions to ensure what they make for you will not conflict with what you are about to dine on.  Each dish that came out was delicious. Some were better than others, but overall we thought the meal was very good. I think my only concern is that my salmon came out with a piece of hair in it. We sent it back, the remade it and profusely apologized. It was a long piece of black hair and very apparent it was not mine nor my dining partner's. This didn't kill the meal for us, but it was not expected either. No biggie though.   Service was decent. They were very attentive and catered to us. There were times that lingered where we needed refills, but he caught on that he needed to visit our table a bit more often which he did during the middle and end of the meal once it was addressed.  That said, the Twisted Frenchman did deliver a delicious meal. If you're looking for a high-end date night dinner, you should check out this fun French-fusion restaurant and expect to be here for at least 3 hours.",

    "text": "This restaurant provided a great dining experience for my boyfriend and I. He had made the reservation to celebrate my 25th birthday and we were very excited to try out the 8-course meal. For starters, the interior is beautiful and very modern, with upbeat but not distracting music. We were greeted by the host and hostess and taken to our table quickly.  We each got a cocktail to begin, which were both great - a Sneaky Jerk and a champagne cocktail. The drinks came out quickly and our server re-confirmed our dietary restrictions (no shellfish for me, no pork or MSG for boyfriend, although we didn't expect the MSG would really be an issue here!).   Our meal began with some lovely, flaky bread and a potato leek soup. The soup was perfect and had some toasted almonds in it as well - a new and fun idea! The next courses included beets, mushrooms, fois gras, salmon - all well prepared, beautifully plated, and delicious. Some of the items were saltier than I would have liked, but the flavor was still great! Our hiccup came when a server presented us with a dish of pork belly (w/ crispy oysters on top) - which neither of us could eat given our restriction. We brought this to the attention of the server, who apologized and remedied the situation. Our initial server had seemed quite clear on our restrictions before we began, so we weren't sure where the communication was lost, however we just hoped that there weren't stray ingredients on our \"cannot eat\" list that had been hiding in previous courses.   For the dessert, I got the apple option while my boyfriend opted for the almond cake. Given how full we were from the previous courses, it was hard to fit in dessert! But the dessert looked very elegant and they added in a candle for some birthday festiveness!   This dinner did take quite some time - it took us a little over 3 hours to finish our 8 course meal, so plan accordingly if you have other plans for the evening after dinner!",

If you are a picky eater, if you feel the need to accost waiters for a list of ingredients, or if you have intense dietary restrictions....I would say that this place is not for you. You will pay a lot of money only to miss out on the complex intentions of a wonderful chef. Each course is thoughtfully layered, each ingredient equally important. It's a foodie wonderland, and a perfect place to follow your mother's rule of \"eat what you're given and finish your plate.\" The staff is obviously well trained and knowledgable, and the course progression allows for a lovely mix of conversation, wine, and gorgeous food. Lovely!",

It is a small boutique restaurant and from the Spartan modern decor, the emphasis is on the food and wine.  They offer a smaller menu selection than most restaurants, but everything offered appeared to be excellent and inviting. I indulged myself with the Steak Tartare and the Duck.  Both were awesome.  The duck was a very generous portion, but you don't get much steak tartare - based on the price I expected about twice the portion.  I think I got maybe two tablespoons worth.  The wine was very good.  I had an Alsace Reisling.  The dessert menu is a total disappointment though.  Frankly, I think the chef either mailed it in or the pastry chef quit the week before.  I had the choice of vanilla custard or ice cream.  Surely you are joking...  Despite this, it's a 4 of 5 star place.  The food is THAT good that you can overlook the small appetizer portion and the joke of a dessert menu.",

The escargot was chewy (I'm used to melt-in-your-mouth at the truly top quality places) and the bed of risotto was over-salted.  The consomme was rather flat and had unnecessary foam (2011, anyone?), and the prime rib was fine with an ok Bordeaux sauce.  The scallops were the one dish that held up to expectations.  It was fine, but way too much money for the quality.  We live a mile away but will not be back.  Cafe Du Jour and Dish on the South Side were far better--at least the last time we went a few years ago.",

By the looks/smell of the smoked salmon, I regretted not ordering that dish.    Per usual, the starters were the tastiest dishes.  I should have skipped the entree and dessert, and just ordered all starters. The entrees were also great, though.",

But those negatives pale in the face of the wonderful pleasure of dining here. We were greeted by an extremely attentive waiter who provided for us perfectly throughout. Never had to lift the wine bottle or wonder when the next course might be presented - everything was presented with perfect timing. We started with the foie gras, which is absolutely to die for. Don't do as we did and share: get one for each of you. Best foie gras we've ever had. I had the Rohan Duck and my wife the Lamb. Each were presented with full descriptions of preparation and ingredients. Bit of a risk for me to order a plate with sweet potatoes, but as the chef himself pointed out, they were confit, and excellent. The mix of sweet/savory and mouth feel in the entree's was nigh on to perfect. For desert my wife did the vanilla and I did the chocolate, which is - of course - accompanied by liquid nitrogen. The chef did the honors and his statement of \"it never gets old\" reflects his enthusiasm for what he is doing. Make reservations. Go here. Wear comfortable shoes.",

The presentation was surprising and pure puff happiness. My husband had the shellfish and grits. He was in love. And luckily he shared his grits....so yummy. My dinner was the Bordeaux Duck. Most things are cooked here using the Sous Vide method. So things stay moist and are perfectly medium rare. My husband had the steak. Perfect. Stuffed to the gills, we still made room for the frozen chocolate dessert. Frozen with liquid nitrogen very slowly, then broken. The acidic fruit pairs wonderfully. Worth every penny.

From the Foie Gras and Aged Beef Tar Tar, the appetizers are truly delectable with each component of the plate wonderfully interconnecting with the flavors of the others to provide a mesmerizing work of culinary art. This holds True for the entrees which are not to be outdone. I recommend the aged strip steak which is dry aged for sixty days and pairs wonderfully with crispy brussel sprouts, shoestring onion garnish, a delicious French puree, and aromatic truffle butter that makes your mouth water before even consuming it. The dessert finishes the meal with a BANG as the chocolate two ways provides the most amazing chocolate brownie expertly crafted from pure dark chocolate to go along with a diaphanous chocolate mousse which is prepared at the table by the executive chef who creates a creme brulee crust using liquid nitrogen. As he does, there is a cool smoke that flows from the bowl and provides a gastronomical experience that feels like a magic show. This place will blow your mind.

    "text": "I chose this new Penn Circle restaurant to celebrate my birthday. First of all, parking in this neighborhood during prime dining hours is challenging. If East Liberty is to rise like Venus it needs more convenient parking. However, I found a spot at 6:30 on a Wednesday without too much trouble. I suspect that on a Saturday night it would have been worse. The restaurant is small and exists in the space once inhabited by Notion. For about an hour, we were the only diners. This was great for us as it afforded us plenty of time to relax and peruse the brief but adequate menu (7 appetizers, 5 entrees, 2 desserts). In spite of its brevity, all of the choices were creative and attractive enough to be considered. For appetizers, my dining partners and I chose the foie gras (onion marmalade, nut butter, balsamic, brioche) and beets and goat cheese (arugula, honey vinaigrette). All were outstanding and beautifully presented. Our entrees were Elysian Fields \"lamb wrapped lamb chop\" (brie stuffed onion, concentrated carrot) which was a chop inside a burger and Piedmontese strip steak (brussel sprouts, blue chips, truffle butter), all done perfectly and presented elegantly. Both desserts were wonderful and were  presented with a flourish of liquid nitrogen mist! Noticed at another table: cured salmon smoked at tablsidee by covering the fish with a dome of fresh charcoal-fired smoke. There is a short French wine list by the glass and by the bottle. The wines we sampled were excellent and paired well with our dishes. The bottom line is that this is one the finest restaurants we have experienced in a long time and potentially the best in the Burgh. Go there!",

HOWEVER, i felt like i was on an assembly line! it seemed as though everyone was having the tasting menu. it was as if all they did was make the tasting menu, so it came quick & fast: every dish perfectly the same. which is what you want, i know, just not that perfect.  i watched as the chef went to each table saying the same rote speech as he poured the nitrogen over the dessert. he didn't seem to be feeling it. it got pretty loud too, as the people drank more. again, i get that's what they want, but for a romantic, quiet meal for 2, nah. we had to yell to talk to each other. i'd give it another try, but i'd order off the menu, & maybe go on a week night instead of the weekend. & i'd wear better shoes for walking!",

We had the salmon and seafood grits appetizers - fantastic! This is one of the few places selling upscale wines by the glass, so enjoy. For an entree we had Steak and Quail, which were superb. Seasonings are right on, cooked to perfection. Highly recommend you give this restaurant a try.",

    "text": "Party of four on a Tuesday night, and we were very pleasantly surprised. Pittsburgh has a lot of fancy and expensive restaurants, many of which, I feel, don't deliver either a unique experience or good value. The Twisted Frenchman gets it right, beginning with the atmosphere. Good bistro feel, with a laid back but attentive approach to service.  We were presented with the wine list, and our server was obviously an enthusiast...she not only was able to describe the different offerings, we were welcome to try anything on the list before making a final selection. Turns out our initial choice was not as good as our second, so we were able to hone in on a winner.  The menu is varied, and carries such real bistro fare as sturgeon, squab and duck.  The appetizers, cured salmon and fois gras, were a touch over done, however when we brought the salmon to the server's attention, apparently it is a style of cooking you either love or you don't.  The mains, however, were fantastic.  A rack of lamb you could cut with a knife, a ricotta dish that made our toes curl, and steak that was the best we ever tasted. Presentation was simple but attractive, and the service the the right level of care.  We finished off with two desserts shared; the clear winner a frozen chocolate dish that was just right in its tartness.  Dinner for two with a glass of wine each, around $120 not including tip.  Definitely on the \"go back\" list, if only to see if they can knock it out of the park again with different selections.",

At the entrance, no one was waiting to seat us. After a bit of hesitation we decided to go inside and see what we should do. We almost were entering the kitchen area at the back of the restaurant when someone finally told us to sit somewhere. It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was not busy at all.

After sitting down and ordering drinks, we ordered our meals with the waiter.     The waiter informed us they normally like the entire table to participate in the tasting menu, but he said he would ask the chef.  I explained that my wife is 8 months pregnant and could not possibly consume a tasting menu and asked them to make an exception.  Unfortunately the waiter came back with no as an answer.  The reason cited was the portion sizes really need to be prepared for at least two people or food is wasted.  My wife explained that she is a vegetarian and asked if they would prepare a separate tasting in that case.  The answer was yes, which conflicts with food waste argument.    Clearly they were just trying to extract maximum $ out of the table.    Based on that, we paid for our drinks and went next door for a much better experience.    I give 2 stars, because the drinks were nice and the service was attentive and polite.  It is a shame the chef is not very accommodating, especially for a place trying to make its mark and form a reputation.",

The old fashions were perfectly prepared and the wine list included some of my favorites. My husband and I splurged on the chef's tasting menu since it came highly recommended. While everything was good, I was a little underwhelmed ( maybe because my expectations were so high). The menu was surprisingly boring- a beet dish, a salmon dish, a steak dish (among other things). It felt like an iteration of a meal I've had a thousand times before. The dry ice dessert was a fun show and it tasted like heaven but I felt like it was an attempt to  make up for something the main courses lacked- creativity.",

    "text": "Is this the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh? Very possibly.  Chef Andrew Garbarino's Twisted Frenchman is a great \"find\" in Pittsburgh.  A passionate chef with a heart for French and Northern Italian cuisine, coupled with that solid C.I.A. training, and vision and soul to create magnificent dishes from locally sourced ingredients.  His pheasant consomme (the inspiration was Paul Bocuse's truffle soup) served with smoldering hay on the side just to add an olfactory sensation from his youth, was \"sensational\" and I would get that dish every time I dine here in the future.  Speaking of truffles, this is the season and the Chef incorporates them into the dishes as appropriate.  Our party of four had the fish and chips (delicate and refined), the tartare (a very harmonious dish that incorporated foie gras and truffles), agnolotti (wonderful combination of delicate herbs with truffles), oysters, petite poussin (very delicately prepared, again with some truffles), USDA Prime strip steak, and salmon.  Everything was outstanding excellent.  One of the things I ask fiends when we dine out is \"what dish did you like the least,\" and we all agreed we loved everything and would easily order the same dishes.    The Chef uses liquid nitrogen in preparing some of the cocktails, as well as the dessert he prepared tableside for us...quite impressive and I don't want to spoil it if you order dessert.  This is a small, manageably-sized, restaurant where the Chef can really give each diner the attention they deserve.  His mastery of the latest cooking technologies (we did a kitchen tour afterwards) enables him to create magnificent, natural, amazing taste sensations that you'll want to come back for. His staff is as knowledgeable, capable, and friendly, as you'll find in any great restaurant.",

I'm from Pittsburgh originally but live in NYC and took my girlfriend to Le Bernardin last Valentine's Day (the #1 Zagat-rated restaurant in all of New York City -- not just for French cuisine, but overall). As expected, it was delicious.  The Twisted Frenchman though -- in Pittsburgh no less! -- is even better. The food perfects traditional French and adds delicious innovation. I expected one dish, some part of a dish, to be less than spectacular. I was waiting for a let down because it was too good. But Drew and his staff delivered on every dish.   The paste on the side of the pate was something you might ignore at even the fanciest restaurant, only to taste it and discover it is foie gras-infused puree and home-made mini chips specifically crafted to enhance an already delicious beef. Each detail of the presentation was precise -- from the off-center placement of the lamb that met the art 'rule of thirds' to the theatrical conclusion of freezing the top of his signature dessert at the table with liquid nitrogen.  And the chef is a consummate gentleman -- visiting each table, and always saying \"we\" not \"I\" when talking about the food. It's no wonder because the staff are themselves knowledgable, entertaining and efficient. They all seemed to be homegrown as well; who needs New York when Pittsburgh is finally retaining its own talent? Quite possibly the best meal any of us at the table -- half native New Yorkers -- has ever had.",

Before this review gets further, I should say upfront that this restaurant may not please everyone. This place isn't for you if: 1) you want your meals to come in inhumanly large portions; 2) you are only happy when you get the biggest bang for your bucks; or 3) you think liquid nitrogen only belongs in science classes.    The Twisted Frenchman offers a fresh take on classic dishes. On paper, the dishes that composed my three course meal sound standard enough: foie gras, lamb chop, and chocolate mousse; but the way these dishes were prepared was definitely not strictly old school.  The lamb chop, for example, was wrapped in ground lamb, cooked \"sous vide,\" then browned. The result is a wonderful contrast between the tender, juicy chop meat and the crispy outer skin. The accompanying side is a poached onion shell piped with brie-whipped mashed potato. Surprisingly, the onion still had a crunch to it; it was a great pairing with the velvety, creamy, mashed potato. The chocolate mousse was a fun show piece. Chef Garbarino came out with a pitcher of liquid nitrogen and poured it over a bowl of melted chocolate. He then cracked and mixed the frozen surface shards with the soft gooey chocolate beneath. Every bite was a delicious contrast.  I can't wait to see what new adventures Chef Garbarino will dream up next.",
