    "text": "I absolutely love this place. We had dinner there tonight, their special included DuClaw beers but none of their beers are over priced and they have one of the better craft beer selections for south side. I had a Fat Heads Bumbleberry, which I've had before and absolutely love & my bf had a Bouncy House IPA. They had a lot of great summer beers on tap. Anyone can find a beer they'll like there!  For food we had a BBQ chicken wrap w/ fries and a chicken sandwich. For the regular chicken sandwich you can pick any of their wing sauces/rubs to go on it. My bf is partial to their Jerk rub and he got that. The chicken sandwich is HUGE. And inch of chicken probably hangs off 2 sides of the bun. My wrap was awesome as well. The service is always good too, bartenders remember you even if you aren't in there TOO often and it's nice seeing a friendly face. It can get crowded on nights like Wednesday when they do wing night but their wings are totally worth it.  It's fun to watch sports there as well, they do black & gold shots when Pittsburgh scores (jager & goldschlager) which is always a good time.  I highly recommend checking this place out, it's off the beaten path of Carson Street (one street back, on Sarah) but it's absolutely worth it.",

Their wings, as far as the chicken goes, is average to above average.  Good size, cooked pretty well.  The sauces however, are out of this world.  Here's what to do: Go here on a Monday or Wednesday night around 6:45.  The wing special starts at 7.  Look over the menu at the wing sauces.  They serve them in groups of five for $0.50 each.  Each group of five can be a different sauce.  Try a few, and start with the ones",

I find myself lusting after it at strange times.  I would do anything to get one.  I want one right now.   If you're not a red meat eater... their chicken wings are superb and they offer tons of different sauces and rubs.  You also have the option of getting a crispy or grilled chicken wrap with the wing sauce of your choice on it, for those who don't like the wing eating experience. Definately worth checking out.  There are 3 floors here.  It's tucked away in the far end from Carson on a back street making parking a bit easier and definately a breath taking establishment and a great place to watch the sports games at! Let's go Pens! Occasionally the owners will bring their GORGEOUS dogs in, that's always a wonderful treat! You can still smoke in the bar area which is a nice thing, if you smoke.",

    "text": "The first time I went to \"the other BBT\" (as opposed to the much more established Bloomfield Bridge Tavern) I liked it. They have a nice looking bar/restaurant. I ate a burger, which was pretty good. And, the bartender and owner did come over to us and chat it up a bit. The owner tooted his own horn about his wings (which I did not order). I love wings so i made a mental note to try it next time. All in all, a pleasant experience. In my mind, I decided that this could be a good after work/local bar, especially given the South Side location, even if it is a couple blocks from the real action.  I went back again this week, and I was sorely disappointed in my second experience. The bar is still nice - clean with a nice aura, not a dive. But, a few things went wrong: first, when we finally got to order, the bartender denied my request for wings because they were out. Okay, if you have signs that say \"Best Wings in Pittsburgh,\" you don't run out of wings! Second, they didn't adhere to the new no smoking law. It was like 8pm, not 1am; and there were a few tables of customers. If I had known, I would not have gone there because I just didn't plan on stinking when I left that night.   So here it is, a 2-star rating. The food is not bad (still haven't tried the wings), but it's nowhere near great. If you have to go, order a burger or the veggie wrap - those are good. I really want to like this bar, but they're not giving me any good reason to like it that much. Everything is just okay, even though the bar itself is nicely kept.   [The other] BBT, you'll have to give me a better reason to keep you around!",

So it should tell you something about the quality of this bar that I routinely make the 20 minute trek from Morningside to the South Side to go here.   I have been eating wings all over this city since I moved here a few years ago and BBT is my #1 spot for wings without question. They are generously sized, cooked perfectly every time, and lathered in delicious hot sauce. They also come with a side of celery which I consider an essential part of the wing eating experience. The high quality of the entire menu is abundantly clear. Even my wife enjoys their bar food and she typically dislikes bar food.   Their beer selection is great, but when I'm here I tend to stick to light beers to wash down all the glorious heat from the wings. The prices are fair and there is usually some kind of special going on.   Lastly, the atmosphere in this place rocks. The bartenders are laid back and efficient. Make no mistake, most people are here to have fun, be a little loud, watch the game, and drink. But what you don't find is the typical groups of douchey young 20 somethings that infiltrate most South Side bars.   BBT without question earns 5 out of 5 stars.",

I had a blue moon and we ordered some wings which weren't bad at all.   The only thing that I didn't like about this place (and maybe it's cause I'm from NYC and spoiled) but people were smoking cigarettes at the bar.

I've never had a burger make me thirsty before. Secondly, they allow smoking, so the stench affects your sense of taste, too. Thirdly, instead of music on the speakers and sports on the tv, they were playing some super - annoying reality TV show, where the only thing you could really hear was that every other word was bleeped out. The bar stools were the most uncomfortable I've ever sat in, but they looked better than the chairs on the floor, which could not have been cheaper.   The chairs are an exception, though. The rest of the place looks good, when you can see through the smoke. Exposed pipes, brick walls, and tin ceilings, it really is attractive. The bar, itself, is very nice, highly lacquered wood on a top that feels good under your elbows, and they keep it clean, which is nice.   Also on the positive side, the waitress was good, effective, though not overly friendly. There is a pretty nice, varied selection of beers on tap, and the waitress had a printed beer menu that described each selection in detail.   Maybe it deserves better than one star.  The smoke is a personal preference, but I didn't know you could smoke in any restaurant anymore. I just can't get past how terrible the burger was, though.",

    "text": "Walking in here, you expect the music to come to a stop and everyone turns around and stares at you.  You know, one of those dive bars that everybody knows your name, because you're a regular.  But for me, a stranger coming in, I thought it would be awkward.  I'm happy to report, it wasn't at all!  It almost seems like paradise!  A cozy little corner bar that has cheap food and a comfortable atmosphere.  We stopped in on a whim and it was a good decision.  It was 50 cent boneless wings and then at 8pm the beers went half off (Thursday night, just so you know:).  The news just kept getting better!    The selection of beers on tap is awesome.  What's even better is that the bartender was super nice and kept getting us samples of beers she thought we'd like.  I'm a total wimp when it comes to ordering spicy food, so I opted for the non spicy side of the menu (it's cool they have the menu listing from mild to hot wings).  I chose the garlic parm and Golden BBQ (honey BBQ).  They were good, a bit small, but not surprising for boneless wings.  I really liked the BBQ sauce, it was sweet and tangy and mixed well with the ranch to dip.  The absolute only  thing I didn't like was that they allow smoking in here still.  I had just washed my hair that night too, ugh!  That smoke just sticks to you....yuck!  I have a feeling this could become my new \"spot.\"  Who knows, maybe I'll even become a regular...and not look disdainfully at the stranger walking through the door, because I'll know it's worth it!",

First off its a smoking environment and I went for dinner it just doesn't sit well with me. The service was slow and not too friendly. We ordered cheese sticks (cold, nothing special), beer battered pickles (way too greasy and pickles were to soggy) and the beer battered BBQ chicken sandwich (the beer batter was so over cooked it was almost black and I couldn't even eat it) we tried cutting up it and removing the batter but it was so much work for a sandwich we heard so many good things about. The garlic Parmesan fries was not in the slightest garlicy. All said and done my boyfriend didn't even touch his sandwich. It was a flop for us. The beer was good though.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are new to the Pittsburgh area and it has been our experience that the Yelp Reviewers, in this area, have rated such restaurants such as \"Taco Bell\" with 4 stars. As a result we decided to disregard the reviews and base our judgement off the pictures..We have learned our lesson and will return to reading the reviews. Based off the photos and the little we read; we  were expecting to walk into a Tavern like place instead just a standard Bar. If you are looking for a place to grab drink this place is fine; good beers on Tap. However caution if you are going to eat there.  The food was not terrible and is your typical standard bar food. My boyfriend had a Ruben Sandwich and I had a Mushroom burger with Swiss cheese. The negatives of the food was it was really greasy and the chef over cooked my burger; I asked for it be medium rare and I received it well done.   I did not complain about my burger being over cooked; as a matter of fact I was grateful. Had we read the reviews we would of seen that this place allows smoking. In the Northeast restaurants/bars do not permit smoking so that was surprising. It honestly was not a big deal until the Bartender/our server was smoking while she was working and then serving our food. Her hair was not pulled back and wearing flip flops. I have worked in restaurants since I was 13 and to be honest I was a bit grossed out. I'm not sure what the health code laws are but if any server presented themselves that way; we would have failed inspection.",

Though it's in the South Side this place is far enough out of the way that it escapes the normal douchery associated with East Carson Street. The inside is small with about 10-15 bar stools, 3 high tops and 2 regular tables. BBT has a great warm feeling with its tin ceilings, brick walls, low lights, and life long South Siders quietly getting drunk. They have a rotating tap list of about 20 craft beers, and usually have some sort of special starting around 8 pm, my favorite being Saturday's $2 Yuenglings till 8, then $3 Sierra Nevada's 8-11. You can affordabley get wasted all day!   Everything I've eaten here has been awesome, burgers, fries, nachos, and wings. The wings are actually my favorite in the whole city, especially when they are sauced with their Golden Boy sauce (mixture of golden mustard and hot buffalo). They have $.50 wings on Monday's and Wednesdays from 7-10. My only gripe is that their food specials always start at 7, I work on the South Side so it would be nice to stop over right after work. Maybe I'll just have to start putting in longer hours. I bet that will make the cold beer and hot wings taste even better.",

So you can imagine the ridiculousness of one waitress taking care of everyone because the bar tender is only capable of pouring coors lights.. The server wasn't even there til the exact start of wing night and they said they couldn't put it any orders ahead of time. When she did arrive she started at the front of the restaurant and took each table's order one by one and then put in all the orders AT ONCE. What sense does that make?? That first table had to wait at least 20 minutes before their order was even put in by time she got to the last table and then I'm sure that backs up the kitchen. She also made snide \"joking\" remarks about us being parked in \"her spot\" in the parking lot. Parking is for customers period and no one cares if it's \"your spot\". Finally when the wings came out they were overcooked and dry.. There are plenty of places to get wings in the area so there is no need to bother with this sad excuse of a bar!!",

All of the bartenders are so friendly and they always have the best beers on tap. They have bottles as well. Their menu is amazing, they have traditional bar food and super unique items like a shrimp wrap.  My favorite menu items are their fried pickles and their veggie wrap. I always add Thai hot sauce on my wrap and they have amazing ranch dressing (which probably sounds like a lame thing to review but my boyfriend and I are pretty particular about our ranch). Any of their wraps are great. The only thing I don't adore about this place is their French fries- they are bland in my opinion. Literally everything else that I have tried there I enjoy. Their French onion soup, salads, wings- delicious. Monday and Wednesday is their wing night. Favorite bar hands down.",

Nah, I hope this place gets shut down.",

Whenever I have a serious wing craving, this is always THE place I want to go; more specifically for their dry rub jerk wings, the golden boy sauce is 2nd choice for me, then Thai fire.    We met some friends this evening and I had  their delicious jerk wings and perfectly cooked fresh cut fries but my husband only had 3 words: Pulled, Pork, Sandwich!    The BBT is famous for #WednesdayWingnight , #burgers and other great food along with great beers, especially when the local teams are on.  The food quality is fresh and delicious. Their salads are amazing.    This evening, we found out they 'smoke their own' BBQ! As the wife of a BBQ freak, it was perfect. Moist and perfectly balanced with spices and smoke. They said they smoke their meat all day Saturdays, and offer Sunday bbq specials.",

They also have burn your face off flavors too which my friend always gets a side of the sauce so she can control how spicy it gets.  They have an extensive beer list and always have a special going on.  It's fun to watch games here too and they have TVs everywhere so no matter where you sit you can watch.  Staff is super friendly and food is really good.  Definitely check it and and we'll probably see you there on Wednesdays but save some wings for us!",

I love Eric Jr, Eric the Red, and Death Metal. Also, their garlic parm wings are good, too. This place is 2 stories and can get packed fast, so get there early on wing nights. As I mentioned, I can't give it 5 stars because there is a lack of waitstaff. The waitstaff works as hard as they can, but it's tough to give the proper attention to a full bar, and 6-8 full bar tops. Therefore, expect to be waiting on refills, etc. Every time I'm in Pittsburgh, I try to make a stop in.",

Some bars just serve food to guzzle down and take no pride in the food, this place doesn't do that, from the burgers to the sandwich's to the wings and the huge handmade pretzels, everything is incredible. The atmosphere was calm and cool, unlike when in the middle of Carson street in southside. This is perfect for a late night beer or a Sunday afternoon lunch, the prices are great as well. When you want a bar with a cool vibe and good food, this is a nice choice.",

Our absolute favorite is their chicken tender wrap. You get to choose a wing sauce for the chicken. The wrap is large and comes with a side of fries and a pickle.   After unfortunate experience at another restaurant, we decided to come here to celebrate our wedding and my husband's birthday. Sara was the bartender and server. She did an awesome job helping us and congratulating us on our marriage.   We ordered the philly steak fries as an app. Wow! Absolutely delicious. Fresh cut fries with philly steak and delicious cheese. The cheese had a nice kick and spice to it, pairing it well with the fries and steak. Normally sauteed onions are on the fries but we opted out of them.  The tavern also had a taco night on Monday.  We decided to each get a taco. I was expecting basic tacos with a tiny bit of beef and cheese. Their $1 tacos on taco night are slow cooked pork or chicken, slaw and pico. Great for only $1.  For dinner, I went with the General Grant Chicken Salad. It had grilled chicken breast strips which had  Bourbon BBQ sauce on them. It was served on top of  mixed greens and also had tomato, cucumber, onions rings and bacon. The salad was delicious. I believe the General Grant is also a sandwich which has chicken, bourdon bbq sauce, onion ring and bacon.  Absolutely delicious meal. Not your typical birthday dinner / celebration of your wedding, but we were treated well and the food was great as always.  thankful to live 2 blocks away from this tavern!",

Great beer selection and a full menu, with TVs at all angles so you can see the game no matter where you are sitting.  I had a chicken wrap with their thai chili sauce. It was tasty - next time I'll up the spice level and try another wing sauce on the wrap. Fries were done well and perfectly salted! Love that the place is nonsmoking and that they have bike parking outside.  Daily drink and lunch specials make a great option for people who want to grab dinner / drinks in the south side but want to stay away from the usual touristy spots.",

Then I ordered a grilled chicken salad.  It literally took 40 mins.  At that point I didn't even want it and my appetite was gone after the nasty tacos and buffalo chicken dip.

Started out with the loaded nachos, the chips they use were too salty but otherwise very good chili and toppings. We ordered some garlic parm fries after reading about them on Yelp, but they were kind of bland. The star of the show is the wings, other wise this is a 2.5-3 star review.   We split 10 of the Eric Jr flavored wings as the menu says that is their award winning flavor. It was good, but a touch spicer than I like on a wing- I will get buffalo next time as Eric Jr is very peppery and had me chugging water. Regardless, the wing is as tender as you will find, and perfectly crisp. Definitely worthy of the hype.",
