The hostess said that she hadn't gotten them out yet. It feels almost like you are an inconvenience to the staff (the exception is the bar staff, they've always treated me well).  Is it really that difficult to find people who aren't rude and care about their jobs?",

There is a lot of eye catchers around the room. We got seated at a table near the bar and felt like we were on top of the party next to us. With how the room is designed, it's LOUD. Not the best ambiance for conversations. After some wait, a server finally came over and asked what we wanted to drink. They had a decent cocktail menu. A friend got the Dirty Pickle and I had the Daly Dose. Both very good!  All we were given was a late night/snack menu at 4 pm... Wasn't sure if that was for a happy hour... we weren't told about it was. So the cocktails were a plus, service was a dud.  With all the other fabulous options for dinner near by, we decided to move on to hear each other talking. Can't say I'm running back, something was missing for me.",

    "text": "This is a 2 part review that focuses mostly on service; as I have not dined there, but have on several occasions had business groups stop in for drinks.  The decor is cool, and due to its proximity to the office, convenient.   Beer list is decent. Not a wine connoisseur, but seems fine. Scotch collection is adequate.  Service has been TERRIBLE on 2 occasions.  1. Had a large corporate group at the bar. Waitress serving tables at the bar was extremely annoyed and outright rude to us as it was implied that we were in her way repeatedly. Poor bar design is not the customers fault. The area is narrow and not suited to have easy access by servers. Also, the rest of the more accessible tables in the restaurant were empty, as it was barely 5:30. Manager came over to ask us to move later, and was also extremely rude and could use a lesson in customer service. A simple, \"Here group of 10 enjoying drinks at our bar, we want to make room for you over here\", would have done nicely.  2. A week later, another group of mine go to enjoy appetizers and drinks before dinner. We order the Paul Hobs 2007 Pinot Noir, they arrive and open a 2012. Upon realizing the error, we politely ask why the wrong wine was given, and also ask to just have the price of the 2012 vintage reflected on the bill. 1st response was, \"the bar manager said they are the same price\". When we ask to see the manager, we are promptly ignored on the issue for the rest of our visit.  Suffice to say, inadequate service for a place which had great potential. Keep it up and you'll be closed before you can pay for the fancy decor and renovations.",

Nothing. After perusing the mediocre-looking menu, we looked around and tried to make eye contact with someone - anyone - to place an order. No one came over, ever. We waited 15 minutes and then left to go to to Meat & Potatoes - a much more pleasant experience (and an awesome menu).   Don't waste your time on Ten Penny.",

    "text": "Let's set the stage. There's convention center right around the corner. We are on limited time for lunch so as a rule we generally avoid places that looked this nice because they take too long as a rule. Good food just takes longer. Well apparently word got around that it had open seating so unbeknownst to us there was An unspoken consent and we swarmed the place like locusts. This place literally went from a normal lunch crowd to bursting at the seams in about 5 minutes. What usually happens in this case comes to pandemonium. Not this time. Their shocked looks quickly changed to determination and they set to work. There are issues when a restaurant gets slammed like that with delays and such. In my opinion, they much less than I would have expected from them. For the life of me I cannot remember the name of the waiter but if anyone official is looking at this, we were the group of five in the horseshoe booth with me sitting in the extra chair they got for us on Tuesday the 8th. This waiter was awesome. He was constantly on the move, making sure everyone was taken care of, and keeping us informed when there was a slight delay. We couldn't have asked more of any server, especially when considering the stress they were certainly under at that time. Now to the food and drinks. I like my Moscow Mules, most mule drinks for that matter, and this one was definitely on par. The food, however, was definitely above par. I got the brussel sprout appetizer which everyone tried and they all loved them. I had shrimp and grits entree which was outstanding, as good as when I've gotten it in the south where I understand it to have originated. Others in my party ordered gumbo, grilled cheese and tomato soup,  salad, and steak of some kind. Everyone was impressed and completely satisfied with the entire experience. Next time I'm in Pittsburg I will make certain I stop here for another great experience. Thanks for reading my ramblings!",

I had stuffed flounder and I couldn't find one lump of crab in the crabmeat. It was served over bland quinoa and even blander Bok choi. Blah.",

It took the bartender about 10 minutes to acknowledge that we sat down.  Shortly after, a group of ladies that sat down beside us and got service right away. As the bartender finish up serving the last one, he asked us if we knew what we wanted and walked away. After walking around for another 5 minutes he finally came to take our drink orders. He warned me about the drink I had ordered and got me a sample (which was the only reason I gave the second star). He proceeded to walk away and clean up the bar.   Overall he didn't pay much attention to what was going on at the bar, but he was scurrying around all over the place. Could definitely use some improvement in the bar management skills.",

    "text": "First let me state I haven't had the food... but that's why I'm writing this review! I live a block from the Ten Penny and on this Saturday night around 8 PM I thought it would be a good time to try out the new place on the block. All the shows in the Cultural District were underway, no crowds, but still prime time dinner time! My party of three walked the block down to Ten Penny looking forward to some culinary delights and some good libations. When we walked in the new place looked great very nicely appointed and upscale the promise continuing to build. Then the sock in the face.... The girl at the front asked if we had a reservation. I politely said no but we live on the street and wanted to grab a bite at the new spot. This is why I'm writing this review...... she proceeds to say there is no seating in the dinning room available without a reservation as I count TEN empty tables without ANYONE waiting to be seated at the door!!!! Then to add insult to confusion she proceeds to tell us we can go to the bar and maybe find a seat.... well it's pretty hard for me to see open tables set for service, no one waiting to be seated then be told they are booked and can't seat me and two others! Little advice if you require reservations put it out online, on Yelp and post a sign then I wouldn't be offended when I get there and count TEN places we could have been seated. Also if management reviews this posting know this I went to another restaurant on the same street and racked up a sizable tab which could have been yours... Three main entrees, one appetizer, three glasses of wine, two mixed drinks with top shelf spirits, and three desserts... you do the math! Oh not to mention your hostess rolling her eyes at me for showing up without a reservation and then snidely dismissing me to the bar for a good luck getting a seat and a meal.  A word of advice, being the new kid on the block, before you can be an exclusive establishment where everyone needs a reservation to get a table...... first you have to build that reputation with strong reviews praising your food, spirits, and atmosphere not turning away dinners who are willing to try you out and take a risk!  SO with that off my chest I'm very disappointed with this new kid on the block!",

For my entree I had the salmon with warm potato salad and orange sauce! Best fish I had ever had! Who said that the best fish came from the coast?   The service was just amazing. The waitresses were so easy to get along with. They even offered me a job... when I'm 18! lol The food came out steaming hot in less than 15 minutes. I will definitely go back soon, and I will spread the word for more people to go there! Please go here! One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!",

It was a family with a dog.  I think they should have declined to seat someone outside in November, when it would freeze other patrons out. Or treated our reservation as well as they did the others. I heard other people complaining, too.  If we hadn't needed to get to a theatre soon, I would have walked out.",

My son had the meatloaf, a generous portion served with a delicious gravy (I know because I stuck my finger in it for a sample!), mashed potatoes that he said were outstanding and fresh green beans.  Our server, Ryan, was charming and efficient, a real pleasure.  I'd have given five stars except that my rice was unusually mushy and the noise level was a bit high--but we were seated right next to the bar and it was Saturday night, so not unexpected; but there is seating in the back, and had I known, I'd have asked to be placed there.

It took the waitress almost 15 minutes to tell me that they were out of sweet tea (????). Then another 10 minutes to come back and say they were out of tomato soup.  25 minutes after placing my order in a very not busy restaurant seems a little long to realize that you are out of a menu item.  When my food finally came, the sandwich was dry and the cheese had started to harden.  For the price, I would expect much better food!!!

    "text": "I visited Ten Penny for drinks & dinner with girlfriends about a year ago and decided to give it another shot last night with my boyfriend. We were going to a show at the Byham and it was one of the first beautiful nights in Pittsburgh this Spring, so basically everywhere downtown was busy. We ended up making reservations on Open Table about 30 minutes before arriving & it looked like we got one of the last reservations because everyone else was being turned away when we arrived.   I remember having a pleasant experience last time I went, nothing that exactly stood out but the food & service was good. Last night was the same. I love the atmosphere inside of Ten Penny, it has the industrial chic look that is popping up everywhere in Pgh, but it's cool & neat to look at. And since it was nice out, they had all the windows open which I love! Our waitress was very attentive & was also very helpful when we asked questions on the menu. Despite how busy she was, she took the time out to explain the specials & answer the questions we had.  Chris & I actually ended up getting the same meal last night. We both got the salmon entree. It has a molasses glaze & pineapple salsa on top. I honestly LOVED this meal! The salmon was cooked to perfection, the glaze was unique and unlike anything I've ever had & I was obsessed with the pineapple salsa on top. Perfect & light meal! The sides are \"family style\" (but they actually aren't that big), so we shared the whipped mashed potatoes & the asparagus. The mashed potatoes were delicious & the asparagus was pretty good but had butter sauce on top that I wasn't overly excited about.  Overall, Ten Penny is always crowded when I go past, the atmosphere is cool and the food is pretty good. I'm sure it will continue to do well in downtown Pittsburgh. There are a lot of other places I would go over Ten Penny but it's always a great option for a good meal and nice night out.",

With all this negativity you are probably wondering how I could rate it 4 stars, the bernaise sauce was the best I ever had! I mean this was lick the plate amazing! Also I am a vegetarian and the chef made the ten penny hash for me with no brisket.  I cannot stress enough how incredible the eggs benefict were.   We were moved to a different table which gave us the miserable waitress, at the first table Dane was our original waiter who was totally delightful and I would ask for him next time I go and I will definitely go again.  I will just order a glass of wine:)",

    "text": "Visited Ten Penny this Friday night before a concert with a girlfriend. Still having horror flashbacks of what the considered a panko crusted chicken breast. After being sat in a timely manner table service was slow from the get go and only got worse, took about 30 mins to get a round of waters, drinks and our meals ordered. At this point the restaurant started to become increasingly busy while our meals were brought out. I had ordered the chicken breast on the menu and a friend had ordered the chicken salad. My chicken \"breast\" was an overcooked thin and oddly shaped piece of meat, it was topped with what was described as a rosemary gravy (tasted no rosemary and 100% jarred) and a spicy jelly which was even less appetizing. Along side the chicken was a lump of waterlogged frozen \"kale\" that was described as bacon brined (no flavors of bacon). Nothing on the plate was warm however the plate was scorching hot, clearly sat under a heat lamp for god knows how long. I ate one bite before I deemed the meal completely un edible. I sat there for 30 minutes watching my friend eat her chicken salad that was described as \"well I guess you can't mess up a salad too bad\". Our waiter did not come back to check on our meals until we were ready to get out of there. He asked if he could have it remade, I declined and he was able to remove the meal from the bill. The manager did come over to clear some sides dishes and empathetically responded with \"that's too bad to hear\" when I expressed my displeasure with my meal. Really not sure how this establishment has lasted as long as it has with all the other fantastic restaurants surrounding it. If you are in that area looking for a bite to eat I highly recommend August Henry's next door. Went there after for a drink and to finally get dinner and had a great meal and service.",

The hostess proceeded to tell us they were on a 2-hour waitlist. When we mentioned Open Table, she said it \"didn't always know when people left the restaurant so it's not always right\". Um, this isn't the premise of Open Table. We could see a 2-top was open, pointed it out, and the. She went ahead and bussed it and we sat down. Very strange. They had the second inside door propped open, so every time someone opened the outer door, cold air came in and froze us. The waitress had no sense of humor. Not even a little. The burger was dry and bland. The atmosphere was excessively loud and made having a conversation very difficult. I wouldn't come back here if I was given a free meal. There's plenty other places downtown and this one isn't worth it.",

When we asked for the checks, the waitress was slow to respond and when she did, she took a long time to come back and collect the money.

    "text": "Great location. Poor service. Overpriced food.   I patronized Ten Penny twice on a recent weekend visit to Pittsburgh. The first time, only for drinks.  The second time, for brunch based on a recommendation and the convenient location near my hotel. My level of satisfaction just seemed to decrease the more time I was at Ten Penny.  The first visit was for drinks. I liked the atmosphere.  Having the doors open along the perimeter of the place to take in the beauty of summer made for a fun and welcoming feel. The beer selection was nice, with a number of local brews on tap but not being a local I had a few questions. The bartender could neither describe nor recommend a beer to me. What a disappointment!   The next day we returned for brunch hoping that the food experience would top the drinking experience of the previous day.  Boy, were we wrong. Our waiter was very nice.  That was the only good thing that morning. The food took forever.  The drinks took ages--I mean,  what does it take to make a mimosa? I was half expecting to see someone walk in with a case of bubbly because running out was the only reason I could come up with waiting 20 min for a mimosa in a relatively empty restaurant. When our food came, some orders were cold,  some had mistakes and some  didn't even arrive,  at least not until others had pretty much finished their meals.  I've never seen such.  All in all, I  would not go back if in town again and I wouldn't recommend Ten Penny to others.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance before heading to a show.  Whenever I got there the place was pretty packed and it would become even more full during the time that we were there.  Thankfully my fiance works downtown and so she already had a table for us whenever I arrived.  It ended up being quite a nice table as we were facing out to Penn Avenue and the outside windows/doors were open giving us a nice breeze.  Other than that the restaurant looked pretty modern with almost all of the tables being hi-top tables with some of the tables looking like that were recycled and re-purposed.  There was also some cool art near the exposed beams of the ceiling as they have a wood planks up towards the ceiling with a number of bottles on top running the length of the restaurant.  Since it was still happy hour whenever my fiance and I arrived, we decided to start off our meals by getting some drinks.  They have a pretty decent selection of beers, most of them being $5 during happy hour, so I went with the Elysian Jasmine IPA while my fiance went with the Fat Head's Bumbleberry.  For our meals we decided to start of the evening by splitting the Crispy Brussels Sprouts appetizer.  It consisted of the fried Brussels sprouts topped with a Jack Daniels' balsamic glaze, candied bacon and blue cheese.  I really enjoyed it as the crispy Brussels sprouts were good on their own but when combined with the sweet glaze, sweet and salty candied bacon and pungent blue cheese, they ended up being really good.  The only thing that I would possibly change with them would be to have the glaze on the side as I think that the glaze made some of the Brussels sprouts soggy and so why even make them crispy in the first place?  Then for my entree I went with the Ten P. Burger which is their signature burger while my fiance went with the seared sea scallops which she enjoyed.  I ordered the burger medium and besides the patty it had on it a fried egg, watercress, red onion jam, cheddar, bacon and pickled vegetables and came with a side of french fries.  The burger itself ended up being pretty good with some nice flavors, especially the red onion jam, and although I missed any taste of pickled vegetables, I could see them on it.  My only problem with the burger is one of my biggest pet peeves with burgers and that was that they didn't toast the bun.  Seriously, if you are serving a gourmet burger with a ton of toppings, TOAST THE BUN.  I want my bun to hold all of the ingredients they are heaping on it and not be a soggy mess that is falling apart whenever I bite into it like this one was.  Apart from the burger, the french fries that came with it were some of the better french fries that I have had recently, crispy and seasoned nicely.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Since I did not look at the menu before coming here, I was a little surprised with the prices.  However the quality and taste of the food more than backed it up.  I really did enjoy the flavors that they had in the food and would be interested in trying some more menu items in the future.",

I had to coach the waitress to ask the kitchen if they could substitute an item in a dish per my sons preference. She wasn't aware restaurants will do something the customer desires and originally denied the change. The kitchen okayed it when she asked. A side dish came out 15 min after our entrees. We got overly charged for the substitution we requested and were granted. We also got charged for a higher price entree we switched from after we made a change from our initial order. We were there too long to make a fuss over a few bucks. Overall it was an average experience. More of a friends gathering place not one I would consider for a memorable dining experience.

    "text": "Love the interior. That was the best part. It's what I would call industrial chic and reminded me of a cool downtown loft. There were lots of windows, so lots of natural light.  We stopped in for a meal around the 3:00 hour. I was disappointed to find a very limited lunch menu that was also cross billed as a late night menu. I was told it was because the kitchen was already prepping for dinner. Something to keep in mind if you want to eat between \"tradional\" meal times.  Because our visit coincided with National Margarita Day, I had one. Very sad. It tasted like sweet & sour margarita mix and that's about all. Granted I'm from California, where we know our margaritas, but this was way below average.  For my meal, I chose the chicken sandwich. It came with melted cheddar cheese and was on what seemed to be a \"homemade\" bun. Tasty. The French fries which accompanied it had a good flavor. I especially liked the rough texture of their outsides. Daughter had the green Thai chicken. While she said it wasn't bad, it also didn't taste like the authentic version you'd get in a real Thai restaurant.  I went with the Creme Brulee trio for dessert--a unique idea which paid off. One was orange infused, one was peppermint (which tasted better than it sounds) and one was hot chocolate with marshmallow fluff on top. Apparently flavors rotate so ask on your visit.",

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch (well they call it brunch) before a Pirates game.  We were seated at a large high top table right away.  While we did not order a drink they had a nice draft list. My friend and I both opted to get lunch rather than a breakfast item although the pancakes sounded fantastic. We went with the cobb salad which came with chopped  turkey, avocado, blue cheese, egg, bacon and peas which were a great addition to the salad.  The ingredients were fresh and plentiful and the dressing (some sort of creamy vinaigrette) was fantastic. Looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "This was our second time to TenPenny - both times at the bar for drinks.  First time we were there was an OK experience.  This time, however, we had a very negative experience with the bar staff - bad enough that I'm taking the time to write a review about it. The bar itself is beautiful, very well-appointed, but still casual and warm.  There are several unique drinks that are generally well-made, although somewhat repetitive - especially with the over-use of ginger beer in a high percentage of the drink options.   One thing about their bar drinks I really did not like is that if it is not specified on the menu, and if you do not specify when ordering a \"common\" drink (martini, cosmo, etc), the drinks taste like they were made with cheap well liquors instead of higher quality options - even though you pay the higher quality price.  This is completely unacceptable.    As I said above, however, our primary complaint was with our two bartenders last night (Saturday evening 12/26/15).  Though it was busy but not packed, both of the bartenders were extremely unfriendly and unpleasant - like nothing I think I've ever experienced before.  Zero friendly chatter, virtually no interaction whatsoever, and they both looked almost put out to have to serve us.  Having served & bartended for nearly ten years, I'm well aware that the holiday season is the most lucrative time of year to work in the industry - people basically WANT to give you their money, they WANT to give you generous tips, and if you are even remotely friendly and good at your job, you will get 25-30% or more on a very consistent basis.  You have to TRY EXTREMELY HARD to get a bad tip in the holiday season, but I simply could not force myself, even with my food service background, to reward two of the most unpleasant people I've ever been served by with a good tip.    It was a very frustrating experience, our first experience at TenPenny was nothing special, and given Pittsburgh's embarrassment of riches when it comes to go restaurant options - we won't be back.",

    "text": "Walking in you know you are in for a treat.  The space is beautiful and rustic with an absolutely gorgeous etched in metal sign for the restaurant.  It has a beautiful rustic glow from the different light fixtures and an enormous bar that even when full wasn't too loud for us to be able to hear each other above.   Went here last night for dinner with a group of five which started with us having to call and ask if we could push back our reservation by an hour and they assured us it was no problem.   There seemed to be a question about where they where going to seat us once we got there, but they where able to make a high top table work. I hope in the future to go back and try one of their comfy looking booths!  Service was a bit disjointed. It seemed as though we had to ask a bit for everything (like more water and for a bread basket), but overall food was served at a steady pace and was coursed out as we asked for it to be.   The food was delicious! We decided to order a bunch of small plates to share and where very happy with our choices.   What we sampled:  Seared Gnocchi:  The texture was perfection. Light and airy, yet filling and rustic with the wild mushrooms and watercress.   Crispy Brussels Sprouts: Out of this world delicious. The blue cheese was not overpowering even though there where some sizeable chunks throughout.  So good!  Roasted Wild Mushroom Flatbread: Good. Out of all of the things we ordered this was the least favorite, but not because it was bad, it was just that everything else was so good!  Hot Rocks: We chose three proteins, scallop, tuna, and american kobe(wagyu).  This was very novel and fun for sharing. All of the proteins where delicious and only enhanced by the accompaniments especially the sweet soy which we kept and dunked the other food into because it was so delicious!   Truffled Fries: So good we had to order two. Absolutely out of this world! The bacon rosemary aioli was delicious and the truffle flavor was perfect and not overwhelming.   We also had a few drinks which everyone was happy with and enjoyed immensely which included the Antioxidant, Rose's Old Fashioned, and the Prickly Pear Margarita!  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!",

First off, the atmosphere is great-loved the decor and the fact that in the summer I bet they can open up all the windows and it will be super fun. I like to give restaurants that just open a little break on some of the mishaps that might otherwise not happen during their opening week so I will definitely be back to try again.  Food:  We ordered the jack daniels/bacon/cheese brussel sprouts and of course they were delicious. Actually a pretty good portion too. People at our table had the filet, duck breast, and the parpardelle pasta. Definitely the duck breast was the winner --it was delicious and so were the sides--only complaint there would be maybe a teence more of the sides. The filet was fine--cooked pretty well, I didn't try it but I heard the pasta wasn't very flavorful. We also ordered the chocolate pretzel dessert which was super good.  They kept running out of wine and beer which I thought was pretty odd--but they do have a sommelier who will come around and give you some wine tips. All in all there are several things I want to come back and try after a few weeks/months.  Pros:  Yummy sounding apps and cocktails (couldn't try them all) Service is friendly Duck breast Decor Complimentary sparkling water (do they have a soda stream?)  Cons: Some of the food was a little bland (pasta/mashed potatoes) Ran out of wine and beer (select few)",

She looked up and me only long enough to say, \"It's amazing.\"  I just nodded agreement and got back to work on mine.  I ordered the mussels, and she got the seared scallops with butternut squash risotto.  My parents-in-law also got the scallops.  They all loved them.  The mussels were fresh, the broth delicious, and there was even some delightful sausage in there with them.  They're listed under \"sharables,\" but I wanted them all for myself, and it was the perfect portion.  Everyone got different desserts.  I will say that the ice cream sampler was a bit on the too-small side, but the chocolate chip / peanut cookie fresh-out-of-the-oven was wonderful.  I tried the chocolate hazelnut cake, and it was very nice, too.  Our server, Bart, was very attentive and polite.  He stopped long enough to take a family photo of us when asked, and always kept our drinks full.  \"Another Stella?  Right away, sir.\"  He was also very helpful in pointing out some of his favorite menu items, but he also sang the praises of the other items when we went off his beaten path.  All in all, the experience was excellent, and I'm dreaming of that mac and cheese, and also of those mussels.  Bravo!",

The decor was quite cool and hipster. I'd come here again.",

I asked for more cream and of course it never came.  The server had work a quick turn around and it showed...I don't blame her, but you have to have a little more enthusiasm in this job even if you are tired.  Unfortunately we will never return!",

    "text": "This is one of the more attractive looking casual dining venues downtown. Located near the DL Lawrence Convention center, it is convenient for lunch or later dining; I've done both. The waitstaff is consistently pleasant and attentive, and the food is reasonably priced.  One thing you just have to try. The basalmic glazed brussel sprouts. Seriously...even if you hate veggies in general and sprouts in particular, try them. They are only on the evening menu (argh, because I was there early today), and delicious. Uber good. In and of themselves worth a trip. That good. We had a nice stop today - me and 2 kids, after attending the car show at the convention center. If there is any downsides, I'd suggest the kitchen pay a little closer attention to some details. The fries for the kids were salty seasoned to excess. Chicken tenders a bit overdone, but the other's burger was just right. My Pittsburgh salad with steak was too big for the amount of rather runny blue cheese dressing that accompanied it, but it was fresh and good otherwise. Our server - Kaylen (sp) - was terrific. Knew her stuff, friendly and she charmed the boy's (10 and 11 year olds). Very well done. I really like this place. Been here a few times, and never disappointed. Minor stuff not worth a sweat. We'll be back!",

We started out with the server addressing our table as ladies when my son was with us. I have a stomach ulcer so I usually have modifications to the menu. We started off with the fried Brussel sprouts with no bacon. It was served with bacon and soggy. I ordered a salad no onions it came with onions. It was served with a Luke warm crab cake. The server was not around to check on us during our meal. I usually don't mention anything but when the overpriced bill came I just had to. The server did remove the salad from the bill. The manager came out and said he would take off the Brussel sprouts too but when the revised bill came out it was $4 higher with no itemization. We had to leave and catch a show. I hope this place can get its act together as it's a great location. The food was very average and the server had an off night but she was sweet.",

    "text": "Our server was awesome! So you can't blame him. Plus it was New Years. But it was actually not that busy.   We started with drinks which quickly arrived.   Our group of 8 had a reservation so we did not have to wait for a table. Props to Kari for her planning.   Started with some apps which arrived perfectly on time. The best part of the meal were the stars of the night. Second was the meatball.   The truffle Mac and cheese was good. The wife really liked it but I thought it was a little to cheesy!   Wife had the brisket and I ordered the filet.   2 other people had the brisket which ended up being a problem. The server came back and told us that the \"owner just walked in and took the last briskets\" all this after we already ordered. I've never heard of that and personally was offended by the selfishness of the owner.   Worst excuse ever and I would have rather been lied too.   Timing was good and they had plenty of runners. And the meals came out timed well but ready further of why that became the flaw.   I ordered med rare filet but it came out well done. At $38 bucs had to return it as it was so dry. Literally two mins later, their 2nd attempt arrived. Burnt, and over cooked again but better than the first time.   I forced myself to eat it but the wine helped it go down easier.   You could tell everything was pre cooked. My mashed potatoes tasted great but you could tell they pre plated them and they had a hard crust on them just like at a wedding.   On to the wife's short ribs. Literally she could not cut them. After one bite she gave up. Short ribs are supposed to be tender and fall apart. These were so over cooked it was terrible.   The rest of our party also had problems. Cold meatballs, disgusting and dry fish, salty Mac and cheese, sweet potatoes and pineapple was just wrong, pork tenderloin was more like pork jerky.   The waiter took the fish off the bill but I choose not to speak up. But he should have asked about the other non eaten meals. We just didn't want to complain.   Sorry but never again.",

Informed at the bar that food would take an hour. Looking at the restaurant it was halfway empty. Only two parties one of 5 the other of 11. We asked for drinks. Took 15 minutes. Asked how long would a salad and hushpuppies take. They said about 20 it took 45 minutes for a salad and four very small hushpuppies that were supposed to have crab in them. None in it. I finished my drink and not once asked if I wanted another. We placed a to go order since they close at 9. Our order sat for ten minutes. Before we questioned the bag it's now 9.  Now they're asking if we want another drink. The best thing about the place was the salad.  Although that came out wrong as well as the second order of drinks.

So I finally had a night where I could get downtown without \"rush hour\" giving me grief.   I called my best friend and asked him to accompany me. It's always a good idea to have someone in your circle who is as honest as you are, eats as much as you, and can toss a few back as well.   We sat towards the back of the restaurant at a table for two as all booths were currently occupied. Our waitress was phenomenal and I recall what she looks like but her name is escaping me. She gave great suggestions for us first-timers, ordered us another round before happy hour was over, and told us to come back for dessert.  We started off we the calamari. I didn't care for one of the sauces, but the calamari itself was delicious and crispy.  Then for our I ordered the Clam and Shrimp Pasta and he ordered the Seared Shrimp and Scallpp Risotto.  My mouth watered with every bit.  We were so stuffed and happy that we went out for cocktails after.  Compliments were given to the chef because he/she did not disappont.   My stomach applauds Ten Penny, our waitress,  and the kitchen staff !",

(Reservations suggested)The interior has a lot of hard surfaces, glass, wood and the noise level reflects that. There is top shelving surrounding with restaurant supplies on it like kosher salt and cans of sauce, kind of a industrial restaurant vibe. Close seating between tables.  We shared an order of mussels. The were cooked perfectly with a garlic sauce. The meat pulled away easily from the shell and was tender.  We followed with salmon and potatoes. The salmon was a generous piece and just the right amount of potatoes.  The server was a nice guy who was attentive and helpful with GF choices",

The last visit, yesterday afternoon, was horrendous. It was a Saturday afternoon and not very busy. The server did not write anything down, and came back 3 times to confirm what we ordered. The people in our party (5) actually joked if the order would come out correct....and alas, it did not. Food was cold. It was obvious it sat for a long time before being brought to the table. Appetizers and entrees were brought at the same time. The server never checked back and I had to find a manager to take care of the issue. There was never an \"I'm sorry\", the server was then incredibly rude, only doing what he had to. And we had to ask for our food to be replaced with hot versions. Save your money....there are many great restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. The decor is hip, food and service are horrible.",

    "text": "I just saw Parts Unknown - Pittsburgh last night, I have to say I am so disappointed.... because I was looking forward to hearing more of some fantastic restaurants from Anthony Bourdain, but he did not. I feel like the show has misrepresented the real Pittsburgh restaurants. So I am going to have my version of Parts Unknown - Pittsburgh. Let me start with Ten Penny Restaurant in Downtown. My husband and I visited Pittsburgh two weeks ago. We had a good time though the Steelers did not win when they played with Jacksonville. But I still want to say Go Steelers! Go Penguins!  We had gone to several very good restaurants that week. The last day on 10/9 while we were at Pittsburgh, we decided to check out Ten Penny as it was walking distance from our hotel.  We walked in Ten Penny around noon, we were greeted by the staff right away. The young guy was very nice and polite. He led us to the seat area in the back, it was next to a large window. I like it.  When we were checking out the menu, I have to say I did not expect this is a sort of Cajun food restaurant.  I do like Cajun food, however, it is not easy to find a good one out of New Orleans.  The waiter came over shortly after we looked at the menu, apparently he was training a young guy who seated us. He told us what the special was that day and also gave a few suggestions on what was popular on their menu. He shared a small, friendly conversation with us, and also introduced the young guy he was training.   He was definitely a good coach, and he explained things well with a down to earth attitude, and very funny.  So I decided to start with Bayou Gumbo, wow...it was VERY good. The taste made me think of my experience at K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen. My entry was a Catfish Po-Boy with a side of mixed green salad. Fish was fresh and tasty, bun was newly baked, soft and yummy. Salad was very fresh. The tomato tasted very good, I guess it must be local.  My husband had theTraditional Burger with the side of mixed green salad. He said it was really good, too. The beef was cooked perfectly and he gave 5 star for his burger. I had a bite of the pickle and It was good.  I had a glass of Pinot Grigio (9 ounce), my husband had one Goose island IPA that was very good.  We noticed they had a good selection of beers, but we did not have a chance to try more as we had to catch a flight later to go home. I also want to mention the setup of the restaurant is really cool, the booth is more like southern style. They are leather seats next to the window. The bar area looks very inviting as the tables seem to all come from old sewing machines. It was quite interesting! So overal I gave 5 stars to this place. Good location, good service, good food, good drink, good hours. So what else do we want?! We will go back when we return to the Burgh.",

We order calamari and Brussel sprouts as appetizers. The calamari had pickles or jalepano mixed in with it. It was a nice added flavor. The balsamic Brussels with feta cheese I believe were outstanding so full of flavor that is the best a balsamic appetizer I have had ever. For my entree I got the TP burger without bacon. The sauce on the burger it was like a jam really gave the burger great flavor with the egg and beef really married it together. I got the burger medium well and it was juicy and not dry. A lot of times when you order medium well cooks over due it but this one was just right. The desserts looked amazing from what I could see from others but I was too full to try it. The one thing I was disappointed about was that their panini maker was broken so they couldn't have flat breads and I wanted to order that. Maybe when I am in town next I can get that.",

The prices are on the expensive side, but this place is trying to attract modern business professionals. The bar tenders are friendly and acknowledge you as soon as you make eye contact with them.  I'd come back for beer and would certainly give the food a shot.",

We tried to sit or even stand at the bar with no luck so the hostess offered us a table right away.    We were just stopping in for a quick bite and some beers.  We ordered the white truffle fries.  They were great!  They were fried perfectly and were crunchy but soft in the middle.  The flavor of the truffle was there but not overpowering.  The aoli they served with it tasted great too.    I saw they had a huge selection of beers, unfortunately they were out of all except 4 or 5.  That was a dissapointment.  I'm sure it was because of the conference and they didn't anticipate the increase in business.    Overall the atmosphere was cool.  They have a large patio area which is nice.  All the staff were friendly and didn't seem frazzled by how busy they were.  Overall a good experience.",

This was well over a month ago ... Poor customer service all around!     One of the hostesses was extremely rude (her name was Janet or Janice unclear).  After being seated at a table, she came over and kicked us out claiming a reservation was here to sit there and kept literally rolling her eyes at us.  We got up and moved and then no one filled that seat.   One of the people in our party questioned 15 minutes later why the table was still empty and she got very confrontational with him.  She literally got into an argument and semi-screaming match.  Very poor customer service.

My husband had the special, a St. Patrick's tribute \"melt\" which was a burger with corned beef -- greasy and delicious.  I had a roast beef skillet.  It was fantastic! It was, however, not what was on the menu at all.  The menu described it as roast beef and red peppers with a horseradish cream sauce and cheddar.  There was roast beef and cheddar, and a sauce that was probably horseradish cream (not much horseradish if so), but no peppers.  There was potato instead.  It also came with a dippy egg on top and a slice of sourdough toast.  It tasted awesome, but it really wasn't what I thought I was getting.  I'd recommend you ask before ordering what you'll actually get.  We also splurged on a slice of Death by Chocolate cake that was brilliantly chocolatey.  I would come back here again.",

They were tasty, but nothing really special in the context of all of the amazing cocktail bars in Pittsburgh right now.  I ended up switching to wine with dinner.  We got the hush puppies as an appetizer as well as the brussel sprouts.  Both were ok.  I got the salmon as my entree and my husband got the meatloaf.  I thought my salmon was pretty good and I was thrilled that they asked me how I wanted it cooked (it's not often that question is asked).  My husband said the meatloaf was good as well.  The reason I give this place a 3 is that it feels like they are trying to walk the line between being hip and being the place to go to happy hour with your coworkers.  Also, trying to appeal to that Pittsburgh crowd with a salad topped with fries...ugh.  We might go back for cocktails if we were in the area, but wouldn't make it a destination.",

My husband and I came for brunch and the tables were mostly filled with convention center out of towners. We ordered Brussels sprouts, eggs benedict and the breakfast pizza. The sprouts were a mess, salty and fatty and bitter. Eggs Benedict had little hollandaise sauce so it was dry. The breakfast pizza dough was raw which made eating the pizza impossible. The atmosphere and the location right next to 2 hotels and convention center is key for this restaurant's survival, because the food ain't helping.",

I appreciated the quick contact and offer to try again.   We went on a Saturday night, around the same time and day as our last lack luster meal at Ten Penny. Our service was ten times better on this try. Our waitress was kind, attentive, and checked back in with us often (this had been a problem before, when often we did not see our waiter for 20 or 30 minutes at a time). We ordered the Brussels sprouts again as an appetizer, and they were much more crispy and less covered in sauce this time. I had the roasted pear salad, which was quite enjoyable and fresh. The pear was truly a highlight. My husband had the burger, which he noted was alright but not the best he has ever had. I only ordered wine this meal, and it was expensive but nothing exciting. My husband had the same experience with this beer. So, overall, it was a pleasant experience but nothing extraordinary. We will probably continue to hit up other downtown establishments first, and go to Ten Penny when they are full or we forgot to make a reservation somewhere.",

At all, around 4 people aside from me. I'm an IPA guy so asked for the Lagunitas, was told it was kicked along with the next two I asked for (I think Fat Heads Head Hunter and Bell's Two Hearted). When I asked, she said that there was a big party the night before and that they just hadn't been changed. Which is upsetting. It was after noon the next day, it's not hard to change a keg.

    "text": "We tried this restaurant because it was close to our hotel and it looked very inviting i.e. open to the outside, nice tables and ambiance.  We asked to sit at the bar because we just wanted drinks and some appetizers.  We sat down as some people vacated.  The bartender removed some of the dirty dishes and offered us menus.  We thought we wanted drinks but then decided we wanted a bottle of wine.  We requested a wine menu and were presented with one that only had wines by the glass.  We had to wait to get her attention to request the bottle menu.  Why are these separate?  She returned to take our drink order and I had to request that she wipe the bar surface as there were still stains, wetness, etc. from the previous party.  She grabbed a very wet rag and wiped the surface, leaving us to have to sit back and wait for it to dry for about 5+ minutes.  Of note, she didn't finish clearing the other items that were at other seats until someone sate there, nor did she wipe them down.  This may have been the bar back's job but he was moving as slow as he could.  He also cleared dirty glasses with his fingers in them and then unloaded the glass washer, without washing his hands.  We had a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  The bottles we normally would have ordered, were a 400% markup so we weren't really interested.  We ordered the crispy brussel sprouts, margherita flatbread, and cheese plate.    We were fully disappointed in all.  The crispy brussel sprouts were not crispy at all.  They probably were crispy when they came out of the deep fryer but the application of the Jack Daniels balsamic vinegar and then the presentation in a cast iron pan, caused them to meld into a mushy, gooey mess.  Putting the vinegar on the side might help but they were not crispy at all.  The margherita flatbread was the most edible of the three but it was underdone.  The crust was not crispy at all.    The cheese plate was almost wholly inedible.  I have had many cheese plates that had honey included on them but never was it drizzled all over everything on the plate.  My husband is deathly allergic to bees and so he doesn't attempt eating honey.  We expected a small blob or honeycomb on the side so didn't request no honey because he would have been able to avoid it.  There were some sprouts on the plate that had no clear purpose.  I had to taste the cherries to determine what they were.  The cheese was very bland and with honey all over my hands, I gave up.  The bartender was very inattentive.  The bar wasn't full so I'm not sure what her priority was.  She was cleaning glasses at one point so her lack of a good bar back could have been a factor but priority should always be the customer.  I requested a glass of ice water to accompany the food.  I drank it, pushed it forward and it was never refilled in her couple of walkbys.  When clearing the plates, she didn't comment on the fact that much of the food still remained.  In the end, we wanted to just cut our losses, get our bill and leave.",

We waited outside while we watched the same scene be repeated over and over again, while the same 18 seats sat empty. Once seated, our waitress ( only positive part of the  experience ) was great...working hard , but the kitchen was over whelmed, and under prepared.

During the entire experience, several groups were brushed off , and sent on their way....while the tables sat vacant.

The rest of my group ordered the Mango Salmon, Cheese Ravioli, and Ahi Tuna, and all had great things to say!   Definitely a new favorite to include in our go-to restaurants before musicals!",

    "text": "We need to find a new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. After a few years of exclusive dining at Ten Penny and being very happy we had two mediocre experiences in a row; most recently Friday Feb 2. First up let's say that the waitress 'Augusta' was good; unlike the disinterested staff (and mediocre food) our last visit. We rescheduled the reservation due to traffic and snow, found that they reported us as a no-show on Open Table - their official service. The drinks - my wife's - like drinking lemon juice; mine - forgot the dirty part of the martini - all not too bad. The food - Truffled Mac & Cheese - 'bland' nothing like when it was on the menu previously which was a must-have.  My Strip Steak - very good slightly over rare but tender and tasty.  Truffled Fries were good. Sweet Potato good too. Her $40 fillet arrived almost medium-well ordered rare.  Sent it back with apologies from the manager.  Second steak came out refrigerator cold in the center, gave up didn't complain; split my steak and took the fillet home to cook - the staff could see the fillet was untouched when they brought the box - expected at least a comment !?   Overall disappointing - a local told me the place has gone down hill - OK for drinks but last time we will be there for food.",

The Bloody Marys are delicious!  Housemade Bloody Mary mix with a little kick.  The breakfast pizza was savory and the perfect amount for one person.  It had a thin sausage gravy as the base, then topped with bacon and crispy hash browns with a beautiful, fried egg on top.  Love the decor and seating at this restaurant.  After the restaurant closes at 2AM, they have a lounge downstairs that stays open until 3AM. Awesome drinks down there.  Everyone that worked there was really friendly and helpful.  Even pointed us to several other places to check out.",

We went for dinner on a Tuesday with a reservation and it took over 45 minutes to get our food and the sandwich and fries arrived cold and when I brought it to the servers attention it was replaced quickly but I was charged twice for the entree. Because of this we were late for a show. I think what disappointed us the most is that the server nor the manager cared in the least.",

Nothing on the menu is especially great. I'm not sure exactly what they're going for but plenty of sandwiches just seem better-than-chain where they try and make up for quality with quantity.   During my last visit the notoriously bad service hit a new low. The checks they brought us were incorrect to begin with, and then once corrected and the cards taken they charged the wrong bills to the wrong cards. Each time we had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find someone to help us. They were not speedy in fixing it. Afterwards, I sent a message using their Contact Us link about the experience but of course never heard back.   It's not possible to go to this place during lunch on a normal day, and when they're off you'll be there closer to two.",

We tried to get table for dinner around 9:00 PM this past Saturday Night (11/10) and we could not get seated.  The restaurant was half empty, plenty of tables available, but the hostess was too busy to seat us.  She stopped by twice, and indicated that she was arranging tables for another group, and we would have to wait.  After nearly 20 minutes of standing in the cold entryway, we (and another couple we did not know who came in after us) both decided to leave.  Two servers were also standing by the front door, but neither offered assistance.  Not good.  We left, and walked elsewhere... plenty of other options around Pittsburgh.  Hostess and servers need additional training here.  Customers are simply not a priority.",

Also, given the table location, as guests waited to be seated they were practically right on top of us. One person even rested his elbow on the back of my boyfriend's chair. The staff didn't seem to care about this in the slightest bit or take any measures to make us more comfortable.

    "text": "Wow, where to begin?  Let's start with how Yelp failed me, and then we'll continue on to how Ten Penny epically failed.  I was craving ahi tuna for lunch.  Knowing the places in town who have wonderful ahi dishes, but not having time to walk/drive anywhere for lunch, I searched for close places with ahi tuna.  In the top 10 listed, I saw Ten Penny.  I was surprised as I didn't remember this on the menu, but knew they served seafood so I thought I'd give it a try.  I walked in to a very empty restaurant.  Being alone, I sat at the bar.  I waited for about 3 minutes for the bartender to come back from wherever the liquor was (he was carrying a lot of bottles to restock).  Joe was VERY nice and accommodating.  I asked for extra lemons with my water and he gave me plenty, without agitation like many servers do.  With no ahi tuna on the menu (thanks Yelp suggestion...), I ordered the gumbo and the featured burger special - Texas BBQ Burger.  It was supposed to come with BBQ, onion straw, spicy pickles, bacon, and pepper jack cheese on texas toast. The description of the gumbo is: Fresh Gulf seafood, okra, Cajun trinity, brown roux, over rice.  This is the furthest from what I got.  I got rice, the brown roux (which was actually very authentic and tasty), 2 pieces of deep fried okra, and 3 large chunks of chicken.  No seafood.  I received my burger after about 15 minutes of ordering it.  I ordered the burger medium rare.  It came out looking like a hockey puck.  The bacon was burnt to a crisp too (at least they're consistent).  There was no BBQ sauce on the sandwich and there was only 1 paper thin pickle.  I ate a few of my fries that came with the sandwich, tried to pick off the onion straws, and ate the pickle.  Joe came back and asked how things were, and I responded honestly \"it's a little overcooked.\"  He was incredibly nice and offered to have the kitchen remake it.  I was on a time crunch and unfortunately couldn't wait.  I did not ask to have the burger removed, but it was clear that I did not eat it at all.  Joe spoke to what I guess is a manager (he dressed more like a jimmy johns employee with untucked polo and khaki shorts).  He abruptly came up and stated \"your burger was overcooked\".  I wasn't sure if it was a question or statement so I showed him the clearly dried out tough piece of meat on my plate.  He said \"oh yeah, that's definitely overcooked.  So....do you want me to like take it off your bill??\" in a very accusatory tone.  I somehow ended up feeling in the wrong, and told him that was not necessary.  It was followed with \"Or I guess I could discount it.\"  I nodded and thanked him (somehow I am thanking him for discounting something that his kitchen messed up).  I assumed he would take off the burger anyways and at the very most, charge me for a side of fries since I did eat about 1/3 of them.   Nope, I get the bill and he took $3.50 off my $14.00 burger.  Most I have ever paid for a few fries and small pickle. Joe seemed mortified and thanked me again for coming in and told me he hopes I come back for a better experience.   So, Ten Penny, kudos to you on hiring Joe.  He is the only reason you got 2 stars, not 0, and the only reason I MAY come back.",

They had lots of lemon taste and the sliced strawberries on top were perfect. My brother got the Hawaiian French toast stuffed with pineapple cream cheese topped with coconut.

It didn't state in the description, but it was not a sweet dessert. It tasted like it was made with red hot candies. Another thing that we weren't super thrilled with was that the water brought to our table was at room temperature and did not come with ice. I liked having water at the table but would prefer it to be cold and given ice in the glasses. Obviously not a deal breaker as our dinners were excellent.",

I've looked at other reviews mentioning how the food was just OK, but i have to say, our food was delicious! My steak was cooked perfectly (even the waiter was like \"wow that's a good looking steak\") and my friends soup was very flavorful. Our waiter disclosed that he had only been working there for two weeks and they were short staffed, so I am not holding the slowness against Ten Penny. The reason I gave it four stars though is because this place isn't very vegetarian or vegan friendly. My friend was basically a vegetarian during lent, and he had a hard time finding something on the menu. Other than that, we had a good experience there. I would go back.",

I usually sit at the bar but the seats at tables are sooo comfy and huge.   They've got a large selection of beer on tap but I always go for wine, which the offer in multiple pour amounts. For food my first time in we got the Mega Meatball which was delicious! I stick to the filet mignon, cooked medium rare and they do it perfectly every time. Thick, juicy and flavorful.   Service is fast, friendly and attentive. The bartenders are great for conversation - I always get Rich and Sam.   Whether it's a date or stopping in after work by myself, it's always the right atmosphere and a good time!",

I apparently was an inconvenience to her because she had other patrons at the other end of the bar that she was giving her full attention to. So needless to say I never got anything to eat so I'm gonna take a walk to one of the competitors hopefully I get treated better more to come ......",

    "text": "I've been to this place twice in the past month and I think it's just terrific!  The service is excellent and the food was just as good.   Of course, I had to have the famous brussel sprouts and they did not disappoint.  Consider that I typically wouldn't touch a brussel sprout with a ten foot pole but these were special. I highly recommend them.   We ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese which is decadent and very rich.  I recommend sharing this and I'm would not get it again but it was worth trying.  The Mediterranean flat bread was excellent and also a good item to share.  The Port-Poached Pear salad was very good and I'd get this again.    Another one of the table favorites was the Truffled French Fries.  Normally, I pass on fries but these were addictive!  I'd get these again as a shared item.    I ordered the Stuffed Murray's Amish Chicken Piccata and absolutely loved this meal! It was perfect for the cold, snowy day and was served hot.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and perfect.  I'd get this again.   On my second visit, I ordered the Mega Meatball.  I have to say, this was my biggest disappointment.  It was lacking in flavor and texture.  This was the only thing I tasted from this restaurant that I didn't like.    I like that you can order different sizes of wine from the wine list: anywhere from a 3 ,6 to a 9 oz glass of wine.  Perfect.  I loved the atmosphere and can't wait to come back when they open the large glass doors surrounding the restaurant.  It's located on a corner and has such a great view of the area.   I do recommend that if you make a reservation for here that you ask for a booth or a regular table.  We made reservations but didn't specify where we wanted to sit and were put at a high top table.  While this would be okay if we were there for just drinks and appetizers, it was uncomfortable for dinner.  The chairs are a bit shallow and cut into our thighs which made all of us uncomfortable for the 1.5 hours we sat there. And no, we aren't over-sized individuals!  The service was excellent and our server had excellent timing on our courses and making sure we had enough to drink.    Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and will be back!",

    "text": "We went here for the Yelp's 10 Days to the Holidays party and really enjoyed the place.  It's what you would expect in downtown- upscale and classy, decorated very nicely like an old warehouse, and extra decorations all around for the holidays.  They were serving several 'small plates' appetizers but the smoked salmon pinwheels were my favorite.  We also had jalapeno poppers and crab balls which were mediocre at best.  Our bartender, Tony, told us that the food wasn't from their menu so they were probably 'feeling out' a new supplier.  The poppers were full of some sort of stuffing with a very mild, very limp pepper inside.  To me- poppers should have a little 'kick' at least at the end to let you know you're eating jalapenos.    The crab balls were full of stuffing with a little crab flavor but on inspection, I could not see any actual crab inside.  Again- these were not on the regular menu so I'm giving Ten Penny a 'Pass'.  A table next to us, not involved with Yelp, was eating from the Ten Penny Hot Stone selections where a very hot stone like griddle is delivered to the table and raw selections of beef, chicken, shrimp & tofu can be ordered to cook it yourself, teppanyaki style, and eaten with seaweed salad and other accompaniments.  My wife couldn't stop watching- giving me a 'play-by-play' as these 2 women enjoyed their 'Hot Rocks'.  I think we'll have to come back just to try this dish.   Thank you Ten Penny for supplying the space for Yelp, we are now 'Fans'...",

For the yelp event we sampled the cocktails, I really enjoyed the cucumber one mixed with gin, followed by the tangueray cocktail which had a more citrusy taste but tasted stronger, I could not swallow the coffee flavored patron cocktail wayy to harsh.   Salmon was delicious but fell apart do easy. My favorite was artichoke stuffed with goat cheese and asparagus soup!! Chicken meatballs were good, but missing the determining taste of pineapple sauce.   The vibe at tenpenny was casual but at the same time a little dressier. I felt a little Underdressed with only a sweater on. I would definitely come back.",

The layout is thoughtful and trendy - it truly gives off a cool vibe for downtown eating. Our waitress was friendly, but everything moved a bit slowly.  They have a solid Bloody Mary menu that allows you to taste some different combinations or make your own for $10. I decided to make my own and was convinced they didn't put a drop of alcohol in it. Wasn't sure if I paid $10 for tomato juice or a mixed drink to be honest. My wife went for the Raspberry Mojito which was tasty but also lacking punch. Very weak drinks for the price.   For my meal I decided to get the Apple Chicken Sausage Hash which sounded great. I was a bit disappointed when it came out and was just egg and chicken sausage on top of some home fries. Not quite the \"hash\" I was expecting. The portion was fairly small as well.   Bottom line:  If your looking to drop $40 on an okay meal for 2, with a couple weak drinks, in a trendy setting - this place may be for you.",

It's marathon weekend and they are right across the street from the convention center.  We stop in for brunch.  It's busy but there is no wait for a table.  Our server brings water and we ordered.  My daughters order the Ten Penny burger and the chicken sandwich.   I ordered the breakfast flatbread; sorry they don't have it.  I ordered the Smoked salmon omelet.  Sorry that's not available either.  Apparently we have old menus.  So I order the strawberry lemon ricotta pancakes. Our server brings more water.  Forty five minutes later I can't even find our server.  I think she's avoiding us.  Finally an hour later she brings our food and 'apologizes again' with a manager behind her.  That was our first apology.  My daughter enjoyed the burger.  My other daughter ate the chicken sans bun as the coleslaw had soaked through the bun.  Both thought the fries were great. My pancakes weren't anything special, not much flavor and very little lemon.  The manager stopped to tell us she had made an adjustment to our check.  The server also told us she adjusted the check.  It was an okay meal but I would have liked to be kept more informed on the delay.  Maybe offered an appetizer or a beverage or just an apology for the delay.",

I loved the open windows and the brick and beams.  Now the negatives.... 1) food wasn't worth the price (from a taste perspective), 2) didn't love the menu selection and 3) my personal pet peeve....the happy hour specials are only in the bar.      Given my experience at the restaurant kicked off with negative #3, I was biased from the get-go.   I asked our waitress if there were any drink specials and she said no, not tonight.   My boyfriend had done some research before making our reservation and said the website advertised $5 wine and beer and we checked it out on our phones and yep they do.  So we brought it up to the waitress when she returned with our food and that's when we were told, well that's only in the bar!  Guess what, if you had told us that when we had asked the first time, I would have moved to the bar and eaten dinner there.  If that's your policy, I dislike it but at least own it and advertise it!! I'll give this place another shot but only from the bar area which means I'll likely order less food (which is why I don't get bar only happy hour policy to begin with).",

We tried this place for New Years, and while our waiter was friendly, that was about the only positive we could give. Overall the service was one of the worst we've ever had--he was constantly forgetting about us, it took forever to put in orders for drinks, appetizers, or dinner, and even when we did, we had to remind him more than once about our drinks that he was literally constantly forgetting. My dinner was actually very good--it was a limited menu that night so I had a filet, but he tried a special for the night, short ribs. As a big meat eater, he was very disappointed because he could not finish them as they were severely overcooked to the point of being inedible.  We wanted to give them another try because my dinner was good and it was a holiday, so we went back again this week. I wish I could say the poor experience the first time was limited to just then, but unfortunately, it did not improve. Our waitress was friendly, but never came to get our initial drink order. Fortunately, a manager did, and it took so long she also took our appetizer and dinner order as well. Food was ok, but given what appears to be an overall culture of crappy service, even when it's not busy (there were plenty of open tables), it is certainly not worth it for us. I'm giving the third star only for how much we love the appetizers which will be sorely missed because I don't think we are willing to put up with not only the hassle of getting there but also the poor service. Oh and to top it off, the waitress took my leftovers but forgot to bring us back the box and sadly, we did not notice until we already left. At least they're consistent in forgetting about serving their customers!",

(Now, if you want to try this option yourself, the dish is the same price as the regular scallops dish-- this did not bother me at all because if they hadn't been able to do it I was just going to order the scallops entree anyhow, so don't yap about the up charge and give the staff a hard time about it!)  We sat at one of the tables, but I am dying to come back with a reservation for one of the booths. They look like big comfy couches!

We placed our dinner order, each ordering a ribeye steak, with different degrees of doneness.   So far, no complaints whatsoever. But then the meals were served and things went from good to not so good. The steaks came first, naked on a plate with only a demi-glace sauce giving some cover. It was totally unrecognizable as a ribeye, being less than 1/2\" thick, and looked more like a piece of roadkill. Because of the thinness of the cut, temperature was non-existent. Also, there was no salt or pepper at all on the steak as served.  The sides arrived shortly after the steaks on a separate plate and the server had to use a hot pad to carry them. Unfortunately, only the plate was hot and not the potatoes (I'll admit I didn't even try the brussels sprouts). The potatoes seemed to have been scooped into the dish straight from the refrigerator and what ever was used to heat the plate failed to heat the potatoes. The bacon in the potatoes was absolutely cold.  In all, the meal was less than mediocre. It was not worth anything near the $32 charged. I've had better steak and potatoes at Golden Corral. It was especially disappointing as some of the other meals that passed by the table actually looked quite good.   I have nothing bad to say about the service.",

From previous pictures, it seems the S'mores Dip dessert comes with a variety of housemade shortbread cookies, but my order came with generic Walkers' shortbread cookies. They also neglected to inform me that they'd run out of the chocolate graham crackers promised on the menu (after trying to order two other desserts that they had also run out of) since they were making changes to the menu. Chocolate cheesecake dip was clearly just cream cheese and cocoa powder.  Chicken and waffles - half a weirdly spicy (it was cheddar and some unspecified pepper) waffle with two small chicken wings (made largely up of bone) that weren't even properly made. The outside was oily and slightly soggy rather than crisp.  Two months ago I had the Hawaiian stuffed french toast, which was amazing with its pineapple cream cheese and coconut crust. Shame nothing here is that great anymore.  I could make better food at home compared to what's being served now. Cook (doubtful that he or she is a chef) should be replaced.",

    "text": "Again on my visit to Pittsburgh for work I find my self starving and in desperate need for food, this time I'm on a time crunch.   Food: It was not the best salad I ate but pretty good. Just felt like a lot of things thrown on and the dressing had a slight kick to it that I personally didn't like. Doesn't mean you won't. The highlight may have been the cornbread croutons, so.good!  Service: There was an hour wait to be seated so we grabbed a bar seat. Our waitress was attentive despite the rush and when we mentioned that we had to be somewhere in 30 mins she had the manager go and check on our salads. Very much appreciated.   Atmosphere: Very.Loud! Definitely wouldn't recommend this if you're trying to have a heart felt conversation. If it's just to have a couple of drinks and a quick meal with friends it's not a bad place. I did like the set up and decor a lot.",

I've come twice for brunch and once for dinner. At brunch, I've had the Ten Penny Hash and Chicken and Waffles. At dinner, I had the Blackened Catfish. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the chicken and waffles didn't live up to my expectations. It was okay - I was expecting it to taste better since the Ten Penny Hash and Catfish were soooooo good. I've had a lot of chicken and waffles, and this wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst. I've always had great customer service here and drinks have always been great. Since it's down the street from where I live, I'll be back.",

Due to the limited menu the only appetizer that sounded good to me was the cheese plate. It was okay. Expensive for what it was. I liked he honey but didn't understand why the crackers were drizzled in it too. Overall it was just a bunch of thin cheese slices, berries, and honey thrown on the plate for 12 bucks. It also took about 15 minutes for it to get to the table. The restaurant was empty and it's not like any cooking was involved so this didn't really make sense to me...I also thought our waiter really seemed like he did not want to be there at all. Maybe True, but it didn't help the experience much.  Overall, not sure I'd rush back here...  Hubby and I got salads, both of which were very good",

I asked the waitress very nicely if the chef had any plant based options or if he could put something together (there was ZERO options on the menu).  I actually said, whatever he could make I would be great with. She came back and said they could make a pasta dish.  She asked if it was okay if they used butter (crazy) and I told her oil would be fine - can't eat butter.  She had no idea what plant based or vegan was, yet I couldn't be the first vegan to ever eat at this fine establishment.  Anyway, was wishing for the best and ended up with a pasta dish loaded with - not butter - but cheese.  Again, can't eat.  I told the waitress I couldn't eat it but not to worry about making another dish.  I had a side salad and asparagus that would be fine.  She ended up making it anyway....this time with at least a 1/4 cup of butter on it!  Ha.  Tough night.   Would have been fine with just a salad if they said they didn't have any options for me.  I am used to it in Pittsburgh and try to avoid those 'vegan scenes' that annoy so many.  Anyway, was hoping for a lot better.",

    "text": "We stopped here for a quick drink on a Friday night, following dinner. We were seated immediately and our waitress was attentive and helpful. I ordered a glass of wine and he ordered a White Lightning. We decided to try an appetizer. My husband likes to joke about judging a restaurant by its calamari. Calamari is a very simple ingredient, that if prepared right, tastes amazing. However, if not prepared right, can come off rubbery and ultimately, shows you the finesse of the cooks. So when trying some place new, if they have calamari, we always go for that!  It came out quickly and was hot. There were two dipping sauces, one which was a spicy, garlic, red pepper, and lime clear sauce. The other, was a milder-tasting Carribean aioli that was tasty. However, we were both turned off by the breading on the calamari. It crumbled right off and tasted like corn meal. It was also over-cooked. Bummer. I was curious about what was in the breading, because the texture kept resembling corn meal to me. Our waitress was kind enough to ask the cooks, who confirmed that they recently changed the breading to a cornmeal base. I think the idea is a creative one, but it just missed the mark, taste-wise. I think this breading would have tasted great on say, a corn dog, but I didn't think it quite went with the delicateness of the calamari.   Bathrooms were neat and clean and easy to locate. About $26 for 2 alcoholic drinks and the calamari.   I wish I had been hungrier, because there were lots of items on the menu that looked like fun, such as the hot rocks, and the beer mussels sounded tasty too. I also discovered, after we left, that they have a whole menu dedicated to Bloody Mary's. Not sure if this is a brunch thing or what, but I would love to taste a few of these next time, as well.",

    "text": "Let's talk about the space first. Gorgeous! They really know how to design a hip and trendy joint. Exposed beams, hanging industrial lights and shelves of spices. Very cool. Definitely very similar to their sister restaurant, Local, but better.  We came in on a snowy Sunday, so it wasn't very busy. I note that because we waited quite a bit for the cheese plate we ordered first. That was a bit confusing because you wouldn't think a cheese plate would take long to bring out.   Thankfully we didn't wait long for our bloody mary and mimosa, so at least there's that. The bloody mary was perfect. Spicy, made with pepper vodka. So once the cheese plate came out we dove in. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. One, because our server just dropped it off and didn't explain what cheeses were on the board. So we had no clue what we were eating. Two because the cheese selections seemed sub-par. Since I'm not sure what cheeses they were it's hard to say where they came from or what exactly they were. I will note that the biscotti on the plate was very good though!  So for the main course I ordered one of my favorite brunch items, eggs benedict. I thought they were very good. The only thing I'd change is the english muffin. It was very thin and I would have liked one that gave a better base to all the other goodness on top. But I thought the bacon, eggs and hollondaise sauce was excellent. But, again, another issue one could find is that it was a small portion. It was enough for me because I wasn't starving, and we had the cheese plate, but I did think it was small.   To sum it up, it was up and down. Our server was friendly enough, other than the misstep with the cheese plate (obviously not a huge deal). I would absolutely come back and hope they just keep trying to improve on things to make it a better place!",

    "text": "After attending the Yelp holidays party at Ten Penny, I was intrigued to try out a full meal. When left with my choice for lady's brunch, I quickly chose Ten Penny. We made reservations but, upon arrival, noticed that about half of the tables were empty. We ordered our drinks and settled into the soft booth. After checking out the menu, I noticed that there were tons of hearty brunch options (eggs, salads, meats) but very limited options for the sweet bruncher. My suggestion is to add a specialty french toast or waffle. I went with the carrot cake pancakes and added a side of bacon (which was only $2!). Our entrees arrived in an appropriate amount of time. My overall impression was that the food seemed a bit undercooked. The bacon was a little chewy. The pancakes were very heavy  with the consistency of cake batter in the middle. I couldn't determine if this was intentional or not. Either way, it did not make for a light and fluffy pancake as expected. One of my dining companions ordered soup and a steak salad. She was very happy with her meal. When we were finished, the waitress asked if we wanted dessert. I inquired about the oh so yummy chocolate truffles we were able to try at the Yelp event. I was hopeful to take them home with me and add them to the dessert platter for our family dinner with the in laws a few days later. The good news- they were available. The bad news- my favorite flavor, mint, had been replaced by a chocolate with goat cheese. What a disappointment. Apparently the flavors change weekly. I decided to pass. Overall, there were a few things I loved about my experience at Ten Penny and a few I did not.",

    "text": "There had to have been a full moon the other night when I dined at Ten Penny, because things were just weird. I've dined here a number of times, including brunch, lunch and dinner. I've had pretty good experiences so far, so when me and my date were looking for a dinner option on a recent Saturday night, I suggested having dinner here. We had no issue getting a reservation around 7:45 and we were quickly seated in the rear of the restaurant. I love the ambiance of this place - it's sexy and very rustic. What I hate is that they take it all the way down to the tables. For example. the table we sat at was formerly a drafting table. So, to my (knees) surprise, they were literally up against a large wheel under the table - ouch! I can look beyond this, but definitely not a great choice for a table. Things got interesting when the waiter came by. If all my previous experiences here are good, the reason why they haven't been great is because of the wait staff. I've found they either provide too much attention or the extreme opposite. On this particular night, I found him to be extremely attentive, but in an annoying, you need to calm down kind of way. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, something in the $30-40 range. When I ordered the bottle, the waiter seemed confused and directed me to another page in the menu where wine prices seemed more than double that cost. Confused, I asked, \"Didn't I just order a bottle?\" It was awkward. I couldn't figure out if he was trying to upsell me, confuse me, or what not.  We ordered the salmon and cioppino dish - both seafood. For an appetizer, we order the shrimp and grits. I enjoyed the appetizer, although my date was looking for a more traditional serving a grits (here, it is a fried grit patty). Our entrees came relatively quickly and were delivered by our server and a busser. The busser standing closest to me held the salmon, the waiter held the cioppino. Here's where it got really wacky. I counted the waiter directing the busser to place the salmon in front of my date almost four times before he ended up just dropping the plate on the table. Perhaps the guy was nervous or had a bout of the shakes, but it was awkward. I wanted to just grab the plates out of their hands. My guests would have been fine scrapping the food off the table and eating it, but I was not having that, so we sent the meal back to the kitchen. The waiter then proceeded to take the cover off the cioppino. I refused to eat the meal until my date's meal was back at the table (which was the right thing to do). Waiter was apologetic and noted that he'd bring some food out to us while we waited. We received bread - some moist mini muffins and two awfully dry pretzel buns with a pumpkin butter - leftovers from brunch perhaps? I shouldn't have eaten those bland calories, but I was hungry and was quickly getting buzzed off the overpriced bottle of wine. Our meals finally returned and we got to work. Neither my guest or I really loved our meals, both noting they lacked a bit of flavor and uniqueness, although the preparation on the plate was clean and nice.   Listen, I've been a waiter and even spilled soup on someone's foot. Things happen and I get that, but I noted above how service always seems to be questionable here. Would I return? Yep, but I'd strongly suggest the management staff try to instill some consistency and standards within its wait staff. This place has a lot going for it and I do want to see it continue to succeed.",

Several items came out of the kitchen with no known table.  Service was spotty at best, I have a feeling these folks were pulled from their other locations to work here though.  There were large gaps of time before we would see the server.  Probably would have ordered more drinks if better attention had been paid.  Atmosphere was good.  The industrial/reclaimed look works well for the Pittsburgh area.    I am willing to give them another try in a few months, once they have kinks figured out and a dedicated staff.",

Our waitress apologized for being so harried but took good care of us. We started with the skillet cornbread: one order had baked well, but the other stuck to the pan. It was thin, went well with the maple-bourbon butter, and helped absorb the alcohol from our beers while we waited for our food. The bar reportedly orders local brews, but these sell out quickly, so they mostly offer IPAs. After a couple of tries the kitchen got all our orders out correctly. The shrimp and grits were hot and delicious. The \"greens\" that come with them for an extra charge are a cute little side salad. The Pittsburgh tradition salad was a large portion of vegetables, with steak and french fries. Personally I couldn't have eaten so much food. The house salad is a decent portion by itself, and with the addition of chicken makes a whole meal. The fish was reportedly well cooked, but the hush puppies were dense and dry, without a lemon to juice over the dish or a sauce in which to dip them. I am glad I got to experience Ten Penny and its Southern cuisine, but because of the noise level I probably won't be back, unless it's for lunch or we can sit outside and gamble on the traffic being less noisy than a full house.",

My wife had the mussel pot. The flavor was fantastic but way over cooked.  For drinks and to chill we will definitely go again, but probably eat something before we go.",

    "text": "Good food, excellent service! I I brought my party of of 30 here for a meal. We had an excellent dinner, both of our waiters were very attentive to my entire group. For a party this large they got our food out surprisingly quick.  The corn bread app was amazing! The bourbon honey butter they put on top is strong,but delicious. The brussels sprouts were a hit with my group but the short rib flatbread was the star of the show-the meat was tender and the horseradish cream sauce gave it a nice kick.   The shareable sides and entrees were equally delicious. The truffle fries, & sweet potatoes are a must. We had a wide variety of entrees (from Shrimp & Grits, to the Meatloaf, to short ribs) and everyone devoured their food! We had a great experience, and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Not awful. Not terrible. Just A-OK.  My friend and I stopped here before a show on a Tuesday.  We got a table right away and told our server that we had a show to go to so would just want to order food that would come out the fastest, so probably just an appetizer. We love flatbread so the appetizer flatbread was something that caught our eyes. The waiter assured us that it would come out fast and so we proceeded to order it. It was legit just a margarita pizza and it was AMAZING. Granted, we were starving and needed something quickly but this pizza was great. I think we wished we ordered two just so we could have our own.   I will say that the three stars have more to do with the food not coming out as fast as we would like and that our server kinda disappeared once we told him that we would be only ordering one thing and no drinks. It was fine, I guess, since we didn't need much else but still.   I would hope to come back and maybe sample more things on the menu and maybe see if I can adjust this review. I like the location, the decor, but I need to try it again to maybe see if this would be a place I would want to take people or come back again.",

There are a ton of places to get good food -I'll go somewhere I'm not treated like garbage. This was my third visit there and I continue to be underwhelmed with how they treat (and disrespect) customers. Most recently was last Saturday when we headed there for drinks while we waited for a table at Condado (the wait at 10Pen was much longer). Bartender Andrew couldn't have been less enthused to be at work. At one point he actually served me something I certainly didn't order (I didn't stutter, he just didn't care to listen) and didn't even offer an apology when I pointed it out.  When ready for our tab (which was all under my name -not even complicated) he looked right at our group and then walked away, leaving us to wait even longer. My hand was literally raised like I was in 4th grade but he didn't care. He earned the tip I left him and it was more than I should've given. Don't complain about crappy tips if you give crappy service and don't work in the service industry if you're rude. ",

The restaurant was not busy.     about 1 hour later our dinner entrees had not arrived and we had ordered a salad and some mini burgers.    This is the second time that our dinner entrees did not arrive.   The waitress finally brought our order but we had to go the penguins game.   She brought our check with no discount or formal apology.   Other tables around us were complaining about the wait time as well.  There are too many restaurants in downtown so i would highly recommend trying a different place.",

Now on to the food...disappointing is an understatement. My meatloaf, mashed potato, and string beans were cold, the praline sweet potatoes were over cooked.  The best thing about my experience was the mega meatball.    Poor service, bad food, and over priced don't make for a long term successful restaurant.  It's a shame too, the location is great, a total money maker.     I wouldn't recommend this place.  I guess it's a good thing they are across from the hotel that way they are guaranteed people will come there.",

    "text": "The reviews and ratings are pretty accurate. The food was very average. I wanted to like this place so much that I made myself think I liked it more than I did. But, the more I got through my meal, I realized that I didn't like it that much. And by the time I left, I settled on a \"meh.\" I ordered the shrimp and scallops risotto. I should have gone with my gut, but I've had great experiences at 3-star rated restaurants, but it was not the case here.   The waitress warned me that the dish had a lot of risotto and most people do not finish, but I had no idea. It was sooo much risotto and only TWO scallops and about 4 shrimp for about $30. Way too overpriced. Lessen the massive amount of risotto and give an extra scallop or two OR lower the price. It is not worth it. As far as taste, it was okay. The risotto was a little salty and not too edible after about 5 or 6 bites. It was really cheesy, which normally is a great thing, but not for this dish. I really just ate the scallops and shrimp which were pretty good and cooked almost perfectly. I also ordered a side of truffle fries, which were, again, just okay. Not bad. If I came here again, I would probably get a burger. It seems that most people here were eating burgers. So, maybe that is the way to go.   Overall, it was a three. My waitress was pretty helpful and she genuinely tried to engage in conversation with me so that boosts the rating. You can try some of the other menu items, but you've been warned.",

I went there yesterday with a group of 6 & decided to finally write a review. I'd give this place 5 stars for the decorations and look of the restaurant, but the food is more of a 2. Prior to 4pm on Saturday, they only have a very limited menu. I got the points Burgh salad with steak & the steak was extremely dry and over cooked. My friend got the same salad with chicken and said the same thing, over cooked meat. Another friend got the sliders and was not impressed either. We did however like the Mac & cheese and the fries. I will say I saw others ordering flat breads that looked really good, but we didn't get one. I'd like to try a flat bread some other time maybe. Our server was really friendly and nice, but it took forever to get our food after ordering, like 30 mins? Drinks are pretty pricy as well. I don't dislike ten penny, but I am not dying to go back anytime soon.",

Somewhere you can come with your girlfriends, date, or to celebrate a birthday? This place is for you.   On a Saturday night around 9pm we walked in to this new and gorgeous industrial looking restaurant. Everything was metal and wood and I loved it. The cool sliding barn door caught my eye immediately as did the etched map of Pittsburgh with the name of the restaurant as a focal piece.  There was a little bit of confusion from the get-go. Where to be seated, drinks didn't come out quickly, took a little bit of time to order. All things that happen with a newly opened restaurant, but I promise, it is all worth it.   Our waitress was very sweet. She was efficient in all of her deliveries and made sure our courses were brought out in an appropriately timed manor.  Instead of all 5 of us ordering entrees, we decided to split a bunch of appetizers and shareables. Seared gnocchi, wild mushroom flatbread, truffle fries, crispy Brussels sprouts, and the hot rocks.   The first thing brought out was the hot rocks. For $16 you get 3 different proteins with 3 pieces each, pickled mushrooms, some sort of salsa looking thing, and seaweed salad. The hot rock was huge and actually very smokey, but worth it. Didn't take more than 2 minutes to cook any of the proteins, and it was fun! We chose scallops, tuna, and Kobe beef. All delicious. Especially the scallops!   Once that was taken away we were brought the house breadbasket and truffle fries with bacon and rosemary aioli. We went through 2 baskets of each. There were pretzel rolls with sundried tomato butter, need I say more? And the fries. Oh my god the fries. So incredibly amazing. The best fries I've ever had and I'm a fry-aholic.   The flatbread was forgettable. Overcooked and really pretty dry. The seared gnocchi were to die for. Perfectly crisp on the outside and creamy and delicious on the inside. Some of the best I've ever had. The Brussels sprouts were also a standout. Sweet Jack Daniels sauce pairs with very crispy sprouts, bacon, and hunks of Gorgonzola. It was heaven. Washed down the a prickly pear margarita was certainly the way to go.  Dinner for 5 (who left very full) with 4 cocktails, ended up being $103. Are you kidding? And that was with ordering another basket of amazing fries. This is a great place for any occasion or no occasion at all. Go, now!",

We asked if we could sit at the bar and the host said they were completely booked and couldn't accommodate us. That prevented us from trying this place sooner. We tried to give the place a shot tonight and it was still just as bad. We got there early thinking we'd have a drink or two before dinner and they said our table wasn't ready which is understandable, we're a half hour early, so we'll sit at the bar, but while looking for seats at the bar we noticed that the back half of the restaurant is empty. We find seats the bartender was nice and attentive. Then we got seated, in one of the completely unused tables from when we walked in now 45 minutes ago. Then once we sat down we saw our waiter twice after getting our food order. Once because we flagged him down and once to get our checks. The food wasn't terrible but maybe a bit overpriced.

    "text": "A-OK restaurant.  I would go again if invited.  Went there for dinner with a friend the other night. I approached this with some skepticism given the very poor reviews that I have read in yelp for this establishment, but I was a guest so I didn't say anything.  Tenpenny is located across the street from the Westin convention center hotel and has convenient valet parking in front of the building.    We went in and I noticed as we walked through the bar area that it's a very cool space--definitely five stars--and there was a really large after-work crowd enjoying drinks there. I would definitely give it high marks as a place to meet after work for happy hour, or meet up with a friend, or to go on a date, or maybe even to find a date. There did seem to be a little bit of a meat market action going on.  We were seated at a booth toward the back of the bar-I think it would be a little loud if you were closer to the bar area-and reviewed the menu.  Good, solid bar menu with some interesting items on it. I got the Arctic char on a bed of lentils.  Solid A-ok (3 stars)  Waitress was excellent. I think my favorite touch was that she had already taken care of my guests parking validation without even having to be asked. He pulled it out she said \"I already took care of it\" I just like that touch. She's very friendly and really knew the menu and was on top of our order the whole time. So important. I read the other reviews and the complaints about the service and I think that's really unfortunate. I hope this means the management got the message and took care of things. My view of things was the people were pretty on the spot with everything.  My one beef was that I asked for nonalcoholic beer and they didn't have one. I think every bar should have nonalcoholic beer as an option. Some of us don't drink alcohol but we still enjoy the taste of beer.  The waitress admitted that she's had several others ask for nonalcoholic beer and had to give the same reply. I ended up drinking soda water all evening which probably is free--Therefore they lost additional money that they could've made if they weren't so snotty about it. (2 stars)",

I had some very specific order adjustments that needed to happen and she was on top of it...and without judgement or annoyance.  I had the strip with roasted Brussels and everything was as ordered and delicious.  My friend had the meatloaf and had zero complaints...even took home leftovers.  The ONLY reason I gave 4 was because the couch looking seats could use updating.  The one I was seated at looked like my dog tried to eat it and it wasn't very comfortable.  Otherwise, Jen was awesome and the food didn't disappoint.",

    "text": "I had a chance to stop in at Ten Penny for lunch last Friday. The staff mentioned they have been open for about three months. First off the place is cool looking, large space and a lot of bar seats. High ceilings and the decor is nice. I will be supplying a pic of the beers on tap. Yes, you now know my priorities upon entering a establishment. ;)  Anyway I am in the middle of my lent obligations so I felt compelled to go with a fish sandwich. The menu is not a ideal match for fish but it is a well diversified and good mix on the menu. No doubt I will try a different item during my next stop in.  The fish was pretty large, side of fries along  with a wonderful side of home made Cole slaw. I was charged a extra $1 for a bun and .50 for cheese.  I have since been informed that cheese on fish is \"yucky\". Well I beg to differ...I guess some people don't like to try new things. :) Back to the meal, the presentation was great, good portion, and I liked the tarter/ketchup in portion cups. I did have 3 people stop by to see how my lunch was. That was nice an  done at appropriate times.  Honestly I spent $20 on lunch and that is too much for my budget. So this won't be a regular stop. I can definitely see myself stopping in for a beer or taking my W to dinner here.",

The waitress didn't even look at me and I waited without a menu or as much as a hello for over 5 minutes before I walked over to where four waitresses were gathered to plead for some service. I'm looking around me and the businessmen around me at the bar are immediately greeted and given normal expected service. I had to flag another waitress down to give my order and she didn't take my menu or tell me about the wine specials, which I would have taken advantage of if this whole experience turned out better. This is the worst service I've received so far and I can't help but feel discriminated as the only Asian or even minority woman in the restaurant trying to just have a quiet decent dinner while everyone around me is acknowledged and served immediately. Can't wait for the food.",

Another friend of mine said he went there and everyone at his table was served cold steaks.  I dont know, I wasn't there, but this is a new restaurant so I think they are just working the kinks out.  But from the food I saw I think I would probably stick to just drinking here.  Its REALLY pretty inside, I love the atmosphere, its like dining in a really swanky Sur La Tab!  I'll be back, and maybe in a few months I'll try this place for dinner.  The service was good, and you win me over with scotch every time.  Every time.",

Late afternoon they have a very limited menu. I ordered the penne marinara and meatball. The meatball was barely lukewarm and a tad overcooked. I wasn't a fan of the seasoning selection in the sauce. The menu listed that it was served with garlic bread. It did not come out with it and when I inquired the bartender didn't know if it did or didn't but he would get me a piece. When it came out it was overdone.   In the end, cool decor and good location. Kinks need worked out and more attention paid attention to details.",

My grandmother and aunt came, and they had drove from Indiana, PA, and were starving. Second, we had about 4 servers. I think that a customer should only have one. In addition, my father wanted to order a steak from the dinner menu, and it was about 3:00, and they don't serve dinner until 5:00. You can easily whip up a steak, no problem. But, the waiter declined. He, or she, (since we had 4 servers, I can't keep track) said we couldn't get that steak, and my father had his heart set on it. We got coffee and dessert, and my mother's coffee was cold and ribald. My ice cream was vanilla, extra freezer burnt and appalling! Yelp readers, unite!",

Drinks were great...can't wait to go back non pregnant and really explore the drink menu but it looked yummy!   Bathrooms clean and spotless for a Friday night.   Great great vibe!  Comfort level - the big booths along the windows have really strange seats...I felt very far say from the table and had to sit on the edge of my seat which caused the cushion to pop up behind me...just awkward. Tables are stationary so you can't move it closer to you.   Overall, I would go back and definitely recommend. Like I said it has a great atmosphere and drinks!",

My mother and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch without a reservation and were seated at the bar. It took 15-20 minutes to get the bartenders attention to order cocktails and over an hour to receive our food after we had ordered. Upon receiving our food, the meal I had ordered was delivered without a side option as noted on the menu. I had ordered the pulled pork mac and cheese ($5 up-charge for pulled pork) and found 3-4 SMALL chunks of pulled pork at the bottom of my meal. We had also noticed that several other patrons at the bar had sent food back to the kitchen and had meals comped.  Just recently, had made a reservation for 11 people for a Sunday holiday brunch. Again, the service was slow and inattentive. Again, we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. Again, there were clearly many unhappy customers - no one sitting around us had any food! After finally receiving our food it was clear that it had been sitting under warmers for an extended period of time, as poached eggs were now hard boiled and eggs in omelets were hard with cold centers.  On a side note, my mother in law had contacted the managers several times to book a private room for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding - phone calls and emails were never returned!  Overall, poor experience, poor service, poor food. Would not recommend. Such a shame for a restaurant with such a great downtown location and creative space.",

    "text": "Not sure this place deserves even 1 star! Went here for lunch on Saturday a week ago without a reservation. Was told they were booked but we were welcome to sit at the bar and order lunch there. After a considerable wait, we placed a drink order and ordered our meals. In the following hour, we never were asked if we wanted drink refills and when our food finally arrived, we were missing side dishes which we never did receive. My daughter's pulled pork omelette had maybe 3 tiny shreds of pulled pork. Wait staff was apologetic and we were told that a bartender had called off with pink eye leaving them short staffed. We chalked this experience up to an \"off\" day and decided to give the place another chance.  We made reservations for 10 family members for Sunday brunch. We were seated promptly on our arrival, but that's the last good thing I have to say about our experience. After waiting a considerable amount of time, we ordered drinks. When the drinks arrived, we placed our orders. Perhaps half an hour later, we were approached by a manager apologizing that two of our selections were not available as they had \"run out\". After at least another half hour, with no food in sight, we asked to see the manager to inquire about our orders. We were told that the kitchen was finishing up our omelette and the food would be arriving shortly. After another 15 minutes, half of our orders arrived. They were very obviously dried out from being under heat lamps...poached eggs were now hard boiled and omelettes were hard, dry and crusty. Ten minutes later, the rest of our table's orders arrived with COLD omelettes and a salad that was inedible. Once again, we asked to speak with the manager who was busy dealing with other unhappy customers. When she finally made her way to our table, she denied that any of our food had been under heat lamps and asked if we wanted to order something else. As we did not have another 1 1/2 hours to wait, we declined. We did not have to pay for any of our orders, but left without eating and by this time, we were all hungry! Embarrassing because we had invited our family members to join us. Will NOT be back!",

I heard no complaints what so ever. The outer wall all open to the outside, so there is kind of an in-door/out-door feel to the place. Decent drink selection too!",

The hostess points to the bar and says we can only sit there. There were no seats together (there were 4 of us) so I asked if we could sit at the table near the bar and a waiter said yes. After 10 minutes of dirty glares from the bartenders, one finally comes over and asks what we wanted. He purposely took at least 10 minutes to get our mixed drinks. Ridiculous. And the appetizers were gross too. Save your money and go next door to Tonic!",

I just ended up getting the mega meatball wasn't amazing the sauce for it was very good. The best thing to eat here are there regular French fries I would only recommend this place for appetizers.

Very rustic but comfortable surroundings. Our waitress could not have been more friendly and accommodating. Ordered calamari rings for appetizer. I have calamari in practically every restaurant I have visited and feel I'm quite an expert and critical. When they arrived, they looked like large onion rings....but, Oh My God were they tender and delicious! No doubt they were handled properly and marinated in milk....superb! Our entrees were just as delicious....well done, perfect sized portions and delicious! Wine selection was just fine and overall pricing was very reasonable. What a pleasant and relaxing visit and I'd recommend anyone visiting Pittsburgh to give this place a try. The couches we sat at were a neat touch, but a little uncomfortable with tilted seat cushions, but hardly enough to ruin an overall great experience! Great job and best of luck to Ten Penny!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g53449-d6106981-r358008828-Ten_Penny-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html&s=6e30d0cde66c72906490efb63eae88618f938445a291ec0f36b0e876cb0095b0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

My friend had the omelette and said it was good but I think she was just being nice. I had the breakfast skillet with Apple chicken sausage. This dish consisted of a cute little cast iron skillet containing cubed \"breakfast\" potatoes which were completely unseasoned, two half dollar sized sausage patties standing on end (prompting my friend to ask what they were) and an overlooked \"dippy\" egg-&9. While the skillet itself was quite hot, the food was lukewarm and very dry.  My friend asked for an order of toast; she got one slice as did I so I'm not sure if toast was included with mine. Butter and jam were on my friend's plate but I got neither. The coffee was good.",

Super nice and accommodating...walked us through the beers and gave us samples (which by the way, sour beer is yucky)... had to flag another waiter down to order...I ordered the mega meatball, because of the reviews...and the fries.  Meatball was good...not sure it would be worth ordering again.  It was moist and not much fillers.  The sauce was rich and very tasty.   The fries were outstanding...they had truffle oil infused...the friend I was with said she had the same fried the night before at the Westin directly across the street which were $3 cheaper and better...The rest of our party said food was ok but service was incredibly slow.  They only had one server for both drinks and food orders..I've been in the food business...most times with party that big and the restuarant not super crowded they put at least 2 wait staff on... good but personally, I would not go back...",

    "text": "On the corner of Tenth and Penn sits one of Pittsburgh's new trendy restaurants - fully equipped with great cocktails, good food and friendly service. Came here for drinks and appetizers before a concert on a Saturday night - the place was busy - but it was just the right amount of crowded that we were looking for.   Very unique atmosphere - open - lots of windows. They make lots of things visible - from their wine cellar, to some pantry items are normally tucked away in the kitchen. Great big open bar in the center and in the back they have gray couch type booths for big groups. They also have a private area with a long dining room style table that I would imagine you could rent out for a party - and of course dinner and high-top bar tables all around, made with beautiful dark wood - butcher block style. It's really a fantastic space.   Fun drinks - but I would not suggest the pickle cocktail - I thought I was just drinking pickle juice - all the other cocktails around the table were delicious though! We got a super fun appetizer. It was called 'Hot Rocks'. They bring you out a really, really, really hot stone for you to cook a selection of proteins that you choose. We got three - tuna, kobe beef, and scallops - they also had shrimp, tofu and portobello mushrooms. They serve you the raw proteins, and you use soy sauce to cook them up on the stone - all they need is a quick sear and you have a delicious, fun, interactive appetizer. Comes with garnishes of mushrooms, seaweed salad and pickled veggies. Definitely something I would get next time I'm in - and I would want to try them all. You pay 6, 16 or 30 dollars - depending on how much cooking you want to do :-) We also ordered a beet salad with watercress, goat cheese, and an absolutely divine vinaigrette - it was fantastic. We were sharing it and the kitchen split it for us - this is always a bonus in my book - especially when they don't nab you with the dreaded split plate fee.   I would love to try dinner here and their brunch menu looks awesome - can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Exciting to visit this place for the first time but we left with some disappointment.  We are dining with another couple who are making their first visit to the restaurant as well.  The hostess greets us and sits us right away near a very large party.  So large that it took around 15 minutes for our server to greet us and to inform us that he has a large party as well.  After reading through the wine list he tells me that I need to pick 3 or 4 different wines because they are out of around 1/2 of the list.  Which leads me to a question why have such a list if you are only able to keep 1/2 of it available?  We pick two wines which are not available, so he takes the issue up with the manager and is able to get us a wine which is more expensive at a lower price.  So the server gets an A+ for making the extra effort.  After a while, he comes back to take our food order and I jokingly ask if everything on the menu is available, and much to my surprise he rattles off 5-6 items that are not available.  Including no scallops for my wife's shrimp and scallop risotto so it was shrimp risotto instead.  Tasting the food and thinking about the meal overall it was very good.  Holding back the star rating is the poor service and missing items on the menu and wine lists.  If you are only going to stock 1/2 wine list, reprint the wine list.  How can you run out of your standard menu items?  And if your server has a large party to care for, don't give him another table of four.",

My steak arrived medium well rather than the medium I ordered.  It was very tender and juicy however. The potatoes were just so so and could have been better. The glaze was wonderful . My husband had no complaints about the tuna. We ordered dessert and I mentioned it was the husbands birthday. They brought out his dessert with a candle. I felt that was appropriate for the establishment.  There were a few other things on the menu I would like to try but I won't rush to get back to do it.

The appetizer and share plates looked more interesting than the entrees, so three of us went that route. The son who went with the burger was disappointed, he said it was just ok. My husband had the shrimp and grits.   Small portion but we thought it was tasty. We also shared the crispy brussel sprouts. YUM. And the cheese plate was very delicious even though I felt the slices too small. I would still get it again but would say it was the only thing I felt was overpriced. The other son got the meatball. It was delicious. Good for a light meal leaving room for dessert later.     As for service, it was a little quirky. First we had a trainee then she left us to another waitress. Their check ups sort of lapsed after we were served our food. The servers who brought and cleared were timely and courteous. The hostess however, needs some sensitivity training. As we prepared to go, my son got to the door ahead of us. Noticing his peculiar movements, she blurts out,\" Is something wrong with you?!\"  Idiot.",

Seated at a table with our friends it took 30 minutes from the placement of our drink order to get them, and it wasn't terribly busy to excuse the length of our wait.  The drinks were great tasting however the sugar imbalance of most of them doesn't make for a pleasant feeling later. The food was decent, but the selection of cheeses on the cheese board is cheap for the price.   Nevertheless, service became even worse during the evening. It took us asking three times for water to be initially provided and twice for bread.  Things that are generally automatic elsewhere.  But it didn't end there, the waiter took a timed amount of 40 minutes to take our credit cards despite multiple gesticulations. He was too busy talking to a couple that wasn't even dining at the place.   Sadly, we couldn't even leave ten penny when we wanted to after the valet 'lost' our car and we had to have his supervisor find he car in some other lot a half an hour later. And we still had paid the $10 for the valet because they have you pay in advance (unconventional and probably convenient for the fact that they know they provide terrible service that no respecting customer would pay for).   All around, decent drinks, mediocre food, and awful service lead to a generous two stars.",

The truffle fries tasted good but they used premade French fries which gave them a cheap look and feel.  I would recommend that they switch to hand cut fries.  The entrees were filling, presented well, and tasted very good.  I had a Moscow Mule and was allowed to keep the copper mug which was a nice touch.",

Every person, and me 3 times of course, thought the food was outstanding. Ten P burger is delicious. Had the stuffed chicken for dinner. Others in my groups had the pork chop and arctic char. Great reviews all around. Good IPA on tap. Very reasonable prices and servers are attentive. Definitely a recommendation for locals and convention goers and travelers alike.",

    "text": "Ten penny is great for dinner. I went with family on a Saturday night and things were a little loud, especially by the bar, but the staff courteously sat us towards the back away from the bulk of the noise.   The ceasar salad was excellent in the maple candied ham on the side of the salad at a nice zing at the end of the salad.   The family member I was with loved her pasta Primavera with veggies and said that she would order it again if you were to come back to TenPenny. I had the stuffed on this chicken for my main course, and it was good but I feel like, in retrospect, the whipped potatoes and the lemon flavor drowned out both the asparagus and the chicken and, it really seemed like the chicken was a side dish to the whipped potatoes. It's worth mentioning that the menu for the Amish chicken noted that there was an artichoke heart in the dish. I couldn't taste it at all unless it was in the whipped potato stuff.  The staff at tenpenny was all very courteous and very nice, but my biggest issue is that almost as soon as I was done with my salad, my main course and my family member's main course were brought out. The restaurant was fairly busy but not to the point where our main course should've been brought out that quickly.    Overall, I strongly recommend TenPenny, and will definitely go back in the future. Four out of five stars.",

    "text": "This was our first time at Ten Penny. We liked the rustic atmosphere and decor of TP.  We made reservations for 5 because we were going to see CATS at the Benedum at 8.  We arrived at 4:45 and were surprised to see the restaurant empty except for 3 guys at the bar. We were told the restaurant didn't start serving dinner until 5, so we had a drink at the bar.   The hostess came and got us promptly at 5.  We were seated at a booth with super comfy couches which was by the window looking out onto 10th Street. Our waiter didn't have much of a personality but he was efficient.   As an appetizer, we ordered the Margherita flatbread, which was delicious. I ordered the seared sea scallops with butternut squash risotto and my husband ordered the stuffed chicken breast.   The dinners arrived in a reasonable time. My scallops were perfect and the risotto was to die for. However, they gave me a ton of risotto. I would have preferred to have less risotto along with some sort of vegetable like asparagus, but it was overall a yummy meal. My husband loved his chicken and ended up finishing my risotto. Our waiter did come back and check on is several times despite taking on more tables.    For dessert we shared the peanut butter cookie. It was made & served in a mini cast iron skillet and topped with our choice of ice cream. We chose vanilla. The cookie was warm and moist...delicious!   Our overall experience was wonderful. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Would definitely go again!  Highly recommend to anyone who wants a good dinner before a show in the cultural district.",

Very antique industrial meets modern feel to it all so it was nice to look around while we were there.   Our server was a little busy but he tired hard to be attentive for our group. We got the calamari which had a sweet, honey like sauce we all loved but the portion size for the appetizer was really small. We also got a flat bread which was decent sized and tasted very fresh with basil, tomatoes, garlic and good olive oil all over it.   I got the pork chop entree with asparagus and whipped potatoes and I was really glad I got it. It was one of the larger meals our server said and we girls were all starving. Everyone else got meals that were more expensive but had less on them and that was due to being seafood or filet. Overall I had enough food to fill me up and I didn't have to have a salad or dessert to do that.   Will definitely be taking my husband to this restaurant since the decorating and culinary styles are right up our alley.",

When I went for brunch, there was not another table in the place. Now it has become one of the busiest restaurants on Penn.   The service I received both times was pretty decent. The first time we were the only table and some of the other guests noted that it had taken a good bit of time to get our food. Some even complained that their food was cold. I, however enjoyed my food. I ordered a special. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind of fish it was. I do remember that the skin was cooked perfectly and it came with traditional French lentils with sausage, carrots, onion and celery. The lentils were also really good. So good that I started making the very same ones at home.  The second time I went to Ten Penny it was for happy hour. I will be honest, I had heard some mixed opinions regarding food and service since I had initially gone so I was a little nervous that it would be disappointing. Luckily it wasn't. The bar was packed but it didn't seem to take long to get a drink or our food. A few of my colleagues and I split some appetizers. We ordered a margherita pizza, the truffle mac n' cheese and shrimp with polenta done 3 ways. All three were good but I believe the mac n' cheese was my favorite.I am aware of the criticisms chefs make concerning truffle oil but if it tastes good I eat it. I will say that it was a little oily but it was also very cheesy and creamy. Overall, the experience was a good one and I would definitely return.",

I'm still trying to understand where the crab fits in with this dish.  Fiesta burger (Special) wasn't horrible but was a bit on the dry side.  Not sure if they just cooked the hell out of it or if the mix of meat to fat ratio was just not done well.  Either way, it was mediocre at best.  The PEI mussels were HORRIBLE.  Absolutely no seasoning whatsoever.  The broth was watered down and void of any flavor to accompany the mussels and shrimp.  Potatoes were raw and inedible.  The only component that had any resemblance of flavor was the kielbasa (likely because it was made externally of this establishment).  Kinda felt bad for our waitress as none was her fault as the kitchen screwed her as well as the severely obvious lack of management.  This place is bad and, quite honestly, is not deserving of the three star rating it had when my wife and I were guests.  Its times like these when I wished Yelp would allow half stars on ratings as a full star is grossly overstated for Ten Penny.  Please fellow Yelppers, save your money and time.",

I make a mean steak on the grill with the right piece of meat, so  hard to impress in a restaurant.  Ten Penny's was a nice cut, medium rare of course.  It was slightly and I mean slightly over cooked. Closer to medium.  Im not a fan of the glazed, borderline A1 sauce on the steak.  I know a lot of people like this, I simply do not.

    "text": "I've been to place on any number of occasions. Its a favorite for work parties due to its proximity to our office. The quality of the bar area is really quite good. An extensive selection of craft beers and from what my whiskey loving friends say, the dark spirits as well. The setup is nice, and recently we had a client appreciation event in the downstairs club area. The service is always very prompt and friendly. The bar tenders are great and the servers diligent and courteous.   The food though, its really just ok. I've never had anything bad here, but then again, nothing that has really made me say \"wow, great meal\". I've had the burgers several times, and they are cooked to order correctly, and topped with fresh ingredients. The selection is pretty typical though, and I wouldn't take over Tessarro's or BRGR, though would consider superior to Burgatory. Though, maybe just a pet peeve of mine, but the pickle served on the side was really limp and weak. How hard is it to serve a cold, crisp, healthy looking pickle? Its a small detail, but sometimes thats the difference between 3 and 4 stars?",

    "text": "Great interior. We had a large party, so unfortunately we did not get to sit at the \"booth\" tables that are actually couches. Our table was a little awkward. With people actually sitting in the seats it was a little difficult to for the waiters to walk behind us to the bar. Even though it was empty when we showed up, it took a lot of time for our drinks to be brought to the table and our waiter was a little bit absent. Mind you, these were two draft beers, one bottle, and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar. To our waiter's credit, though, a few others and I showed up an hour before the reservation so I don't think he was quite prepared. Draft list wasn't huge, but they had a few locals.  Unfortunately for us the oven they used for flat breads wasn't working. Usually this isn't a big deal, except for that virtually everything else on the menu had meat on it apart from salads. There was only one veggie entree, even though the entree list was expansive. I always find that to be super disappointing in restaurants like this that are trying to cater to youngish, trendy crowds. There were 2 vegetarians in our party of 7 and they had difficulty with the menu.   Brussel sprouts were awesome (had bacon), was not a fan of the truffle fries. The aoili didn't taste like anything at all, even though it was supposed to be bacon flavored. Not a bad taste, not a good taste, not an okay taste, just like nothing. I got the mahi + wheat berries. Mahi was just okay, but the wheat berries were awesome. They were served drenched in a glaze with cranberries and oranges. So, so good. Husband was not impressed with his pasta dish. It came out in a huge bowl but apparently it was more of a soup than a real entree.   This place is right by the convention center, and parking is terrible. We got  there before 6, when rush hour restrictions were still in place, and were totally unable to park on the street. We ended up parking in the convention center's garage, which was convenient, but the garage was full by the time my sister got there after six and she also struggled to park.  Overall I would try this place again. My food was good enough, although the quality of the mahi could have been improved. My overall impression is that this place really wants to be trendy. They've put a lot of work into the interior, the cocktail list, many of the food items have bacon or buzzing grain items (like wheat berries!), but they really need to be putting more work into the quality of the food so that people will come back. If I went again and the food was the same quality there would not be a third visit.",

It wasn't even 2 minutes before a very charismatic waiter walked up to me and asked what I wanted to drink. He brought it back very quickly and throughout the night, him and the other employees made their rounds to ask if anyone needed a refill. I was disappointed they did not have the ingredients to make margaritas or strawberry daiquiri, however, the waiter did provide me with a few signature options that I would enjoy.   There was also a platter of food out for us with beef sliders on pretzel buns, meat balls, cheese and veggies, and potato salad. The good was good but nothing special. The sliders could have used a sauce or ketchup so they weren't dry, but I enjoyed the meat balls. Overall, a pretty great happy hour spot.",

There weren't many people there but the wait for the food was fairly long. The sandwich I had was okay, wasn't as crispy as I would've liked. If you like Mike's Red Hot Sauce, you'd like this sandwich. Fries were good.",

My friend and I were headed to a concert after dinner so we ordered our food right away as to not waste time. Unfortunately, our food took over an hour and 15 minutes to get on our tables. And it wasn't like we ordered anything fancy - I had a salad with grilled chicken and my friend ordered a sandwich. I could have gone back in the kitchen and made them myself in less time!

I think they might not been ready for the massive crowd that came with the business convention and service came to a grinding halt.

I tried the meatball appetizer and Brussel sprouts. The meatball was amazing!! The sauce, the texture, the flavor was wonderful. The Brussels were ok. They had a lot of marinade so the flavor was lost. It was a nice combo with the blue cheese and I did eat almost the entire serving! I finished with the Carmel cheese cake which was beautifully presented. It had a nice mild sweet flavor but if you eat the entire thing it's a lot!! My server Haley was great, professional and  fast!  I would recommend this place because the decor is relaxed, inviting and open. The menu has variety for every palette!",

Stopped here for a late lunch with my husband today. It was pretty busy (marathon weekend). The girl at the bar was a little short with us (not overly rude, but also definitely not friendly).   The women's bathroom was repulsive. I don't know what happened in there but one of the stalls was a horror scene. The smell was so bed in this bathroom I gagged. Honestly, it reminded me of an awful gas station bathroom. The entire bathroom was just so gross.   I came back and our food was there. The food was mediocre at best (we got a Reuben and meatloaf sandwich). I noticed we had no silverware or napkins. When I told the waitress, she wordlessly put silverware down on the bar and walked away again. I asked for napkins again and she threw cocktail napkins on then bar. I noticed other people had napkins so not sure why we got tiny cocktail napkins.   Getting the check took forever. We were ignored until a nice gentlemen took care of us and helped us cash out.   Between the bathroom, mediocre food and the service I can't say I was impressed unfortunately. Which is a shame because the overall location and decor of the place is pretty cool.",

I got the Mac n cheese which was good and the pittsburgh salad which was so so. I've had better. My boyfriend had the sliders and wasn't impressed. I wish I would of got a flatbread I saw a few come out and they looked good. The service was good. I recommend stopping for drinks on a nice afternoon and sitting by the windows. I will say the drinks can get pricy but I didn't expect them to be cheap. I probably won't come back to eat because there are better options in my opinion.",

If you're into that overly-hipster, want-to-be cool style with the ubiquitous Edison lights, the distressed wood, and all that overly-copied BS than you'll enjoy the decor. But I guess I've seen it in a million other restaurants and find it uninspired. I was early for my reservation, so they would not seat me in the half empty dining area. OK... maybe there were a tons of reservations coming in over the next half hour. So no big deal. I sat down at the bar to wait. They staff the bar, but apparently the bartender that day didn't want to serve drinks and make money... then followed the arrogance that I had warned about. Unimpressed - I came here to spend money. It always shocks me when people don't want to take money. Once seated in still half empty restaurant, the service was good. But the food was uninspired - bland, over-cooked, lukewarm. I guess I should have listened, and skipped the whole experience. It was exactly what I was warned about: pretentious and arrogant, with a kitchen that gives them no right to either. I hate giving bad reviews, so I'll end with a kind word.  Their location downtown is very convenient.",

The hostesses were so rude. It took three separate requests to get an order of fries going for the one toddler in our group.  We were there for almost an hour before our food order was taken.

I work as a bartender myself, so I'm always gracious and understanding of any barkeep I meet, but this woman simply didn't seem to even care.   1/3 of the 20 taps were empty, bartender took another 15-20 min just to see if we wanted food. Order some fries to start, after 20-some minutes, she cameover and said that someone would check on the fries for us. I then watched her go and put in the order she forgot. Still took another 15 min.   Partner and I ordered a crab cake sandwich and a brisket sandwich (both things can be thrown together in less than 5 min). Food took another 40 or so minutes (meanwhile we're the only other people eating in the restaurant). By this point I hadn't eaten anything all day and was physically sick from waiting for the food so long. Food finally came, bartender didn't even care to ask if we needed any condiments, sides, water, etc.   Food was mediocre at best. You could tell that it had sat under a heat lamp for probably 20 minutes, all dried out and overdone. The brisket wasn't even brisket. It was extremely red and closer to corned beef, not to mention it felt physically hard like jerky. Crab was bland, hardly any sauce. Couldn't even finish half of our sandwiches. Didn't even bother get more drinks. Not worth wasting your money here. It's gone downhill every time I've been there. We basically paid $55 for 2 ciders and some fries. Never going again.",

The fries were very good and my sausage was just like I thought it would be.  I was reluctant to order much because this restaurant did not have good reviews and I was there on a work function.  Not much to say other than it was not bad, but I would not go back until I see that management has made a change and the reviews reflect it.  Note: The paper towels in the bathroom were amazingly soft.",

Both my husband and I ordered it and were very satisfied. The spice of carrot cake with the sweetness of pancakes, perfect balance and very filling. My BIL got a burger, which looked amazing and he was very pleased, both with it and the fries. The boys got two beers each and enjoyed the beer selection. Being preggers I did not get a drink-drink. I did ask our waitress if the coffee was \"worth it\" as I can only have 12 oz of coffee a day, and it WAS worth it. A very strong, rich cup of coffee perfect for brunch.   I also love that their flatware is monogrammed, just a nice touch. Overall a cool atmosphere that didn't feel like it was trying to hard, and the staff were attentive, but not too fake-cheery.   We are definitely coming back to check out their dinner service. From perusing the online menu I'm looking to try the Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Seafood Red Curry.",

We asked for a table of 4 and she sat us at a table for 2 and seemed extremely confused when I told her there were 4 of us standing there. Took the server about 20 mins to come over and take our drink order, 40 mins for our food order and once the food arrived it was cold and dry, do not get the Hash and Eggs unless you like cardboard for breakfast. Beers were flat and drink orders were wrong. Asked to have one of the tv's changed to the football game and that seemed like I was asking them to come up with plans for the next space launch.

We started with the Mega Meatball, which had decent marinara and ricotta.  I got the porcini ravioli with mascarpone, which wasn't ravioli at all.  Instead, it was giant sheets of pasta dough folded over.  Each of the four \"raviolis\" was about six inches wide.  The mascarpone itself was way too tangy and rich (it didn't seem to have anything added to it).  The sundried tomatoes were really hard and they didn't add to the dish.  It was lazy.  My husband got the flounder, which might have been the worse presentation I have ever seen.  It looked like something that you would get from a diner for $8. The side of mashed potatoes was under-seasoned and unimpressive.  The \"creme brulee\" had no hard shell on top and it tasted like frozen cheesecake.  Drinks were okay--too expensive (9.50 for a gin and tonic, and no questions from the server about what gin was preferred).  Costs here are astronomical for the quality of food that you are getting.  In the end, we spent about $150 for an appetizer, drinks, entrees with one side, and dessert.  That wouldn't be bad if they put care into their food, but they don't. Go somewhere else!",

We then ordered after about 15 minutes. Then we waited.... and waited.... and waited..... and waited.... and while we waited an hour and forty-five minutes for our food (mainly mac n cheese and salads) we were checked on maybe once. So eventually most of our food came (one person in our party had to wait 25 more minutes for a salad) and the food was not impressive. The food was not worth the wait and to top it all off the check was completely botched. We told them to put our meals on separate checks. They come in saying they put it on one check and that they'll \"figure it out\". Two people gave cards and the rest gave cash expecting change. They took all of our money and the two cards and \"figured things out\" which resulted in us getting no money back. Overall the service was poor, food was average at best, and the experience was sad. It's safe to say we ain't be back.",

I arrived before my girlfriends on Friday night and was promptly seated.  I didn't catch our waitress's name, but she took really good care of us all night.  I mentioned when she first approached me that I'd had a long week and she mentioned later in the evening \"I know you said you've had a long week...can I refill your vodka diet?\" and I thought that was funny and cute.  We started with the parmesan truffle fries. They were amazing!!  Enough for 4 of us to split.  I tried their loaded baked potato soup (very good but VERY heavy) and also ordered the salmon Caesar salad.  Another in our group ordered the same thing and the other two ordered a salmon dish that came with mashed potatoes.  They loved theirs and I must admit - the bite I tried was very good.  The interior was dimly lit and we were there for a few hours.  It wasn't so crowded which was nice so we could hear each other speak across the table, but after Beer Fest let out, it started to pick up a bit.  I have one major gripe and maybe I'm being petty, but it was honestly just annoying.  As I mentioned, I ordered the Caesar salad and added salmon as my main meal.  It came out on a small plate with two full large romaine hearts topped with dressing, a very large piece of salmon, topped with cheese and large crouton crackers.  Now, I have no problem deconstructing and mixing my salad myself....however the plate was MUCH too small for how much food was on it, let alone having to cut it and mix it with the butter knife I was provided?  I contemplated sending it back because honestly it was just an inconvenient mess.    Salads are pretty when they are in full form and the flavor was good, plus it had a very generous portion of salmon, but I just couldn't get past the irritation of having to mess around with it prior to eating.  Next time I will either order something different or request that my salad be cut up for me...no matter how childish I feel.",

    "text": "I ordered the Ten Penny Burger without the onion relish - as i have an allergy to onions.  The  \"pickled vegetables\" were ON the burger, not as a side, which I'd expected, and the vegetables, including onions, were cut to itty bitty pieces, about the size of the pieces of chopped pickles in a relish!  SO i ended up with onions (in the \"pickled veggies\") on my burger anyway - unnoticed until too late.  The restaurant was hot and we were offered a table that was NOT under a ceiling fan but our request to move to a table under a fan was honored.  Still, on a hot and sticky day, it was uncomfortably warm. I was disappointed that fries were the option for the burger, rather than home made chips, as many restaurants offer.  Our server alerted the manager about the onion issue, and she offered to make another for me, but it was too late at that point.  We didn't pursue our concern/complaint further because oddly enough, we were dining with a gift card given to us on our previous visit because of numerous mistakes with our order (including one re: onions - but numerous other errors at our table of 4) and after this second less than happy experience, we knew we'd not return in any case.  We had more disappointments with our food during these 2 visits to this restaurant than any other restaurant where we've dined in recent years. It is worth mentioning that the staff here is concerned and kind about mistakes -- and obviously are willing to do what needs to be done to correct them - it's just that if more attention were paid to not MAKING the problems in the first place, the dining experience would be more pleasant - as is the case in most of the restaurants that we frequent.",

    "text": "This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday, and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.  When we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok, sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA, which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out, so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels, but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread, and the waitress asked if I wanted the \"bread basket\"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins, I believe blueberry and raspberry, a dinner roll, and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.    Onto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast, that came with Jasmine Rice, a ginger root puree, with baby bok choy, and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger, just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck, though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101, render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy, but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  \"What's wrong?\"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden, stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.  So we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10,000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show, my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10,000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread, as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday, spend a decent amount of dough, only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate, accommodating, and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't.",

We had 6 for dinner.  Everyone loved everything.  Appetizers:  Charred Brussels Sprouts with Jack Daniels / Espresso / Smoked Bacon / Bleu Cheese Crumble   and the Caprese Flatbread House Mozzarella / Roasted Tomato / Basil Pesto / Aged Balsamic. I had the Pan Roasted Salmon with Roasted Cauliflower / Young Carrots / Capers / Thyme / Brown Butter. My party also had the TP Meatloaf, Grilled Pork Chop and Pierogies.   Everyone has been thinking about this dinner for days.  If you're in the Pittsburgh area, this is a Do Not Miss restaurant!",

    "text": "We were visiting The Strip District last Sunday for the first time and found Ten Penny on Google which had lots of positive reviews.  No brainer, right?    The interior decor makes the place look hip.  The location is great.  But, the rude waitstaff, the long wait for good enough food, and the warm limited non-alcoholic beverage options earns them a no-return-status and bad review.   If you want the details, read on...  It didn't start well.  First, they had LOTS signs posted along two sides of the building stating \"Use Front Entrance\" but no directional indications were provided, so one looked and looked up and down the street for this 'Front Entrance' to use.  We finally found a waitress attending tables out on the sidewalk and we asked her where the front entrance was (signs posted all around her but still no obvious Front Entrance).  She looked at us as though we were stupid and pointed to a non-descript door down the other side of the building.  Okay, I'm the idiot.  I get it.  We should've left then.  But no.  We stayed because we were there, we rationalized.    Once inside, there were only a few people sitting at tables in the almost empty restaurant, so we thought it would be easy.  We were starving.  The same outside waitress was (sadly) our appointed server.  We were wearing Pittsburgh Pirates shirts (we had been to a game the Sunday prior and were enjoying our newly acquired shirts).  She looked at us with dismay, and asked knowing the answer, \"Is there a Pirates game today?\"  No, we explained with smiles.  She rolled her eyes.  Okay.  This waitress is NOT a good representative of Pittsburgh's normally friendly people--she should get deported to California with that attitude.  She was pretty so she'd fit right into the California Rude-Scene. Maybe she was mad that she had been scheduled to work on a Sunday.  The sparse menu didn't state whether sides were included with their $16.00 basic hamburger. When we inquired, our waitress was again put out that we would be so stupid as to ask.  I explained that this was our first visit to Ten Penny and since we were 'virgins' we hoped she could be gentle with us.  She said OK.  Turns out, the burger did come with a side, which she had to recite twice because they are not listed on their little menu. I appreciate smaller menus (versus the encyclopedia sized menus at chains like Cheesecake Factor or TGIF), but if you expect your patron to know everything, you need to tell them everything to accommodate your cranky staff.  We asked about sweet tea or raspberry tea.  Again with the judgmental look.  No. Only unsweetened.  Fine. She brought two very small bar glasses filled with very fresh iced tea.  So fresh it was warm.  We had to ask for a glass of ice.  It took 25 minutes for our order to appear.  I expect that kind of a wait in restaurants packed full of guests, or if we had ordered a Souffle.  Our burgers were delivered and set down on our table rather brusquely by someone not our rude server.  No questions were asked such as, \"Do you need anything else\"?  Just plates slammed down like we ruined her day, and then her back as she walked away.  The Aioli that was included was a warm glop that I removed. No salt or pepper or any other condiments were provided.  I had been insulted enough by this waitress and I didn't feel like waiting 5 minutes more to flag her down anyway, so we dove in.  The burger was ok-- it had a lovely char and a great bun, and fortunately had a bit of seasoning.  But, it wasn't so damn good that I am craving to go back there for another.   Restaurants can get by with being expensive, having ugly decor or poor service only if the food is spectacular.  I'm not sure how Ten Penny overcomes all the other short comings.  Unfriendly waitstaff, slow service, average food.  Be sure to go there if you like those things.  We are kicking ourselves for not leaving and going a few doors down the street to any of the 10 other restaurants on that block.",

    "text": "After several years, I have to update my opinion on Ten Penny.   The place is still pretty, but the service and atmosphere the last two times I went was really lacking.   Last night's visit was for happy hour.   In general, the two people working the bar seemed far more interested in cleaning and stocking than they did with serving customers.     It took me over 15 minutes to get a drink menu, and it wasn't served with a smile or any sort of greeting.   Another 5+ minutes to get the drink once she finally returned to take my order.   Each refill required me to flag someone down and then wait.  They really did not seem to be paying attention to the customers at all.  When we wanted food, we had to go to the hostess station for a menu because again, we couldn't get anyone's attention.   We rushed our order to get in under the happy hour deadline.    The food came, but no plates or silver - again, another flagging down attempt.   Just overall poor service and no attention to detail.    My other challenge was that it was miserably HOT in there.   The windows were all open and it was really warm.  Everyone was dressed in work attire and was sweating after only a few minutes.",

    "text": "A friend of ours was in town from Seattle, so we wanted to take him to a great restaurant in the middle of the city. We decided on TenPenny, a place no one in our party had been--the reservation process was quick and easy, and the menu online looked fantastic.   The experience in the restaurant, however, was awful. Our waitress was very nice, but she seemed very out of touch with what they had available in the kitchen. I ordered a jalapeno margarita to start --the waitress came back stating they were out of the ingredients. No big deal, I switched to the cucumber fizz. It was delicious. While we were waiting on our fourth guest to arrive, I ordered spicy calamari for an appetizer for the table--the waitress came back stating they were out of it. So, I switched to the crab dip. When our fourth guest arrived, he ordered a Bell's Oberon beer--the waitress came back stating she was completely embarrassed, but they were out of that particular beer. We were at little taken aback at this point. She apologized a few times and he picked another beer.    We order our food--I got the smashed chicken parmesan style, second guest got the pierogies, third guest got the meatloaf, and fourth guest (who switched beers) got the chicken and waffles. After 45 minutes of waiting for our food, the waitress comes back to tell us, completely beside herself, that they were out of the waffle mix for the chicken and waffles! He switched to the crab cakes without complaint. That's now a total of 4 items we ordered that they were out of. We waited 45 minutes for our food before we were told they were out of the ingredients for one of our dishes. Our food came out and it was cold. The smashed chicken tasted like something you could get at EatnPark, completely bland/void of any seasoning or salt on the pasta or chicken, and it was soggy. The rest of the dishes (pierogies, meatloaf and crab cakes) came out great according to the 3 other guests, so that was a plus.   The icing on the cake--when the waitress was collecting our dishes, she spilled sauce from the meatloaf dish all over one of our guest's work shirts. She apologized up and down. When we were getting our checks, we paid full price for everything (no compensation) even though they were out of 4 items on their already limited menu, our food came out cold, and she spilled food on one of our guests. We couldn't believe it. We still tipped her nicely, as the inventory problem was not her fault--but spilling on one of her guests is. Overall, it was a disaster and I'm embarrassed I took a friend from out of town there.",

To be fair, I don't really like salads unless it doesn't really taste like vegetables, so this salad was more my style the regular \"healthy salad\". It was well coated in seasoning so that I only had the texture of the salad without the taste of raw vegetable. However, in terms of calories, it's probably really high for a salad. It certainly is an interesting twist of the wedge salad, but I can't say that it's the lowest calorie wise or the best tasting one. And for its price, my wedge probably should have been one of those!",

Otherwise, I wouldn't have wanted much else that was still available on the menu. The pancakes were good, but not good enough to make me want to go back for brunch again.

We were looking for a restaurant to make reservations at on a Friday night, and Ten Penny was one of the only ones with completely open reservations at dinner, so we booked it - but now I understand why it was so easy to get a reservation.   We were seated immediately, which was great, but everything after that went downhill quickly. It took nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks. Understandable if they were a fancy cocktail, but they were ginger ales and a draft beer. We also had to remind the server about our drinks as he came back to our table without them (and then blamed the bartenders for talking to each other instead of filling orders). We ordered some apps, salads, and dinner entrees, and not one person in our group of 8 really enjoyed their meals. Not only did they take forever to come out and our server never came back to check on us, but they didn't even look appealing... especially for the price. Do not order the $10 deviled eggs or the slider appetizer (that our server actually recommended to us).   We also had to ask the server for our checks not once, not twice, but three times! He also came back to our table numerous times after that to confirm who was on each check (which really wasn't difficult as it was 4 couples, sitting next to each other). Needless to say, when we finally got the checks they were still wrong, but at that point, we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to have them corrected.   I will definitely not be coming back here, even if there are no other open reservations around town.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch.  Ordered their Fiesta salad with salmon, which was part of their August specials menu.  What's Hot - Quality.  My salad was delicious.  It came with feta cheese, tomatoes and cucumbers.  Salmon was warm, when served, which was also delicious and added flavor.  Salmon was a decent size.  The greens and other ingredients were fresh.   - Portion sizes.  Decent size and filled me up.  Didn't make me stuffed, but didn't leave me wanting.   - Location and layout.  It's on Penn Ave, which is a good location.  It also doesn't looked packed, during lunch, which I think is a good thing given that it's downtown.  Interior is spacious and there is plenty of seating.    What's Not  - Menu.  Their menu is short and looks somewhat limited.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, because they do have options.  However, choices are limited. - Price.  I had no clue what my salad cost.  Only that the salmon cost $3 or $6 extra.  Their monthly specials menu don't have prices for their dishes.  Final Answer Good, not bad.  Am willing to come back, but this place doesn't stand out.",

My risotto wasn't warm, but everything else on my plate and my friend's bowl was, so I can't knock them much for that. I'd never had hush puppies I thought were really good until eating the ones I got there. I was shocked.  Our waitress (Audrey) was wonderful and I need to make sure we ask for her when we go back. I loved that there were surveys to fill out, too, since it indicates that the management cares about how things are going in the restaurant. Not everyone remembers to review places or comment when things go well and I look forward to going back. Almost everything on the menu looked good!  We really liked the atmosphere and between that, the food, and the service, we look forward to going back!",

Placed our food order shortly before 7:00 At 7:25 I asked the waitress to check on our meals, at 7:50 I finally tracked her down and said to cancel the order. I realize it was not her fault but checking on the food or being proactive would have went a long way with us. She was never apologetic, nor was a manager notified. Nothing was comped. I don't care about getting free French fries. It was about the gesture and attempting to make it right. The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because the appetizer we had was good, but the experience left an awful taste in my mouth and I will never go back. It's a shame because the atmosphere gave me high hopes. One more thing. We sat in a booth , and the cushion was so beat up, stretched out, and crooked I constantly felt like I was falling out of the seat. With so much other high level competition within steps of this place no need to return.",

The decor and atmosphere was nice, but the service was terrible.  It was not too crowded and we were able to grab a table in the bar area immediately.  After 20 minutes, with still no appearance of a waitress, we flagged down an employee who indicated that she would send someone over.  After another 15 minutes with no service what so ever, we walked out.   A disappointing experience for all.  8 frequent downtown diners have a bad taste for Ten Penny without even trying the food.",

No one was certain who was doing what or if our order was taken. After the initial confusion subsided, my crab cake appetizer arrived room temperature. I let our server know and she seemed annoyed. I understand it's not her fault and I'm not asking for anything to be removed from the bill, but someone needs to know that the food isn't at the right temperature. That's dangerous! My steak was delicious, however. I did order dessert. The ice cream that came with the dish TURNED! The ice cream was actually soured! I have never had bad ice cream before and was shocked. I again told the server who was even more annoyed. She took the plate and returned shortly thereafter. She said she tried it and would remove both the app and the dessert from the bill. All of this was done with an attitude that made me feel I was an inconvenience. When we were leaving she sarcastically said, \"It was a pleasure serving you!\"  How bizarre! I'll never go back.",

    "text": "Went to Ten Penny before a Sunday night show at the Benedum recently.  A few things to note.  For a restaurant in the Cultural District, the waitress did not ask if we had tickets and a time limit.  Other places around the theaters will ask on the weekends, but not here.  I wasn't in the mood for meat, so I ordered the pasta primavera; husband ordered the TP Burger.  We were both very underwhelmed.  The contents on my plate looked like it could've come from a cafeteria.  No frills, just a white plate with some penne haphazardly thrown on.  The \"primavera\" part of the dish consisted of a few strings of finely shredded carrot and zucchini - it was basically garnish.  There were no chunks of ripe veggies to be had.  Not even a slice of bread on the side.  There was a flavor note in the red pepper sauce that I couldn't put my finger on, but it was the worst red pepper sauce I've ever had.  My husband's burger had an egg on top that was runny and very messy.  He ordered the burger medium and it arrived well done.  So well done it was a hockey puck.  The price of my primavera dish was absolute highway robbery.  A dish that likely cost them a buck to make is going for $18 - for goodness sake they couldn't even be bothered to give the customer an entire carrot!   The overdone, messy burger was $14.  These prices are in line with what other surrounding restaurants charge, but the difference is those restaurants make food that tastes good.  We had hoped for much better from Ten Penny because the reviews were fine, but I'm noticing now that a lot of people are reviewing when they admit to never trying the food.  I cannot understand these reviews unless they're having friends and family write them.  I guess the lesson here is don't' go to Ten Penny if you want to eat.",

    "text": "First, I loved the space.  It is beautiful.  It's warm and inviting and cozy yet has a real warehouse feel which adds an element of cool.  Loved it!  We ordered cocktails from their cocktail menu.  I ordered one with rum and bourbon which was really bad.  It tasted like cough syrup.  My friend ordered one that was tequila based and it also tasted like a different flavored cough syrup.  Another ordered a grapefruit based vodka drink that was so bitter it tasted like drinking lemon juice.  The only great drink was our fourth which was a prickly Pear Margarita.  The other three were almost undrinkable.  I've been to Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye many times and tired almost all their menu cocktails and never had a bad one.  Their mixes are subtle and delicious.  The same with Bar Marco.  Clearly Ten Penny is trying to offer a similar experience but their mixes are little more than a bunch of booze and mixes thrown together, not  nuanced or perfected but simply made to sound good on the menu.  Not good. We ordered wine from then on.  We ordered two appetizers to share.  We got the truffle fries which were really good and the Brussels sprouts which were very good as well.  The waiter situation was a little odd.  We seemed to have three different waitresses that either swarmed us or abandoned.  We were asked several times within two minutes if we wanted to order entrees and we told them we were not ready.    Then we  waited another 30 minutes before we could flag anyone down to take our order.  We ordered individual glasses of wine which took about a half hour to get and were eventually delivered after we asked a couple of times.  We got our entrees within a reasonable amount of time.  Two of us ordered the Clambake.  Everything in it was shriveled up and dried out.   The clams and mussels were dried out nuggets inside their shells, the shrimp was not \"jumbo\" as advertised but small and dried out, the crawfish were miniature and inedible, and yet the potatoes were undercooked. There was apparently supposed to be sausage in there too but neither of ours had sausage.  The \"garlic toast\" was just two pieces of white bread layered on the top of it all.  No garlic, no butter, and barely toasted, just soggy white bread.  There was a white fish in there too that was so dried out it was difficult to eat and not gag on it.  Our other two diners had pasta dishes that were mediocre.  One ate about half and opted to leave the other half instead of take it home.  Then we waited for quite some time for dishes to be cleared, probably 20 minutes while our three waitresses were elsewhere.  And then all three descended upon us within a couple of minutes asking in staccato  if we wanted dessert.  We ordered a couple of them and the best food of the night was their bourbon walnut torte with vanilla ice cream.  It was delicious.  In summary: GREAT atmosphere, comfortable seating, and the rest needs a LOT of work.  Oh, and for a mediocre experience, we paid $140/per couple.  Definitely far too much money for mediocre.",

    "text": "Bad experience: We went to Ten Penny tonight for a nice dinner. It was about 9:30 and it wasn't too busy. The hostess was very accommodating and cleared a booth for us to sit. However, not a single server, including the manager, stopped to greet us or even ask if we wanted a water.  What made matters worse was that the manager walked by us 3 times and never stopped. On the 4th, I think he realized that no one had been over and continued walking on to find a server. After more than 10 minutes without as much as a greeting, we decided to leave. Poor service and poor management skills. I've been in the restaurant industry for a long time and there's no reason why the manager can't step up and greet the table. Set an example for your servers and staff who are busy...let them know that you, as the manager, have their back if they are busy. Do not walk by the table (who does not even have a water) multiple times and keep walking as if you're above that. It is a shame because my girlfriend and I love that place, but are now not interested in going back.",

I'm inclined to give this place 2.5 or 3 stars for service but 5 stars for atmosphere and beer selection -- I settled for an overall rating of 4 stars but probably would have gone with 3.5 stars if it were possible.  The beer selection is extensive and includes 25 or so varieties on draught.  Prices were about as expected for the downtown area of a large city.  I ordered a draught of Troegs Mad Elf; I would have had a couple of more after that, but I was rather full from a large supper next door at August Henry's.  The bartender attended to me fairly quickly, initially, but his speed was adequate and not extraordinary.  However, getting his attention to get a glass of water thereafter was difficult.  I'm sorry if the $1 tip wasn't enough, but I've found in most other places that $1 tip is standard for adequate service, with more generous tips reserved for exceptional service.    Regardless of the mildly poor service, I'd go back there.",

Most of whom were standing around doing nothing but chatting amongst themselves with hideous scowls on their faces. Get a clue people, you're not that cool, you're at work, that's probably what you should be doing. The demeanor of the hostess is what really gave me a horrible taste in my mouth upon entering but, the server. Oh The server, Heather (I only know her name from the receipt because she did not introduce herself) needs to find a profession that doesn't involve people skills; she lacks them completely. She totally rushed us, interrupted the tables conversation to force an order out of us with an entirely empty restaurant, then totally.disappeared for about 45 minutes while some other girl sort of/kind of checked on the table. We informed someone who had some semblance of being a GM of how unhappy we were, but since the whole staff seemed to lack any sort of social grace, he clearly did nothing. It took them three rounds of disgusting cold coffee to even take it off the bill. Cute decor, mediocre at best food, and staff that should be ashamed of themselves. Huge THUMBS DOWN.",

    "text": "I was holding off on my review because I thought initially the kitchen was perhaps having a bad day but the food has been just average two visits in a row.  While the food was by no means terrible it wasn't phenomenal either.  I had the stuffed flounder on both visits.  Again, the flounder was not awful but it wasn't amazing either.  The accompanying side dishes, quinoa and baby bok choy were completely bland and unseasoned.  Perhaps the chef was trying not to overwhelm the delicate mildness of the fish - who knows.  This brings me to my next point, however:  my dinner partner (who is a seasoned fisherman) swore up and down that my flounder was tilapia.  Don't get me wrong when I say I ate all of it on both of my two visits because it wasn't horrible.  Just rather average, uneventful flavors.  I found it strange, however, that the menu advertised it as flounder when it was, in fact, something else.  The highlight of the meal was our appetizer, crispy brussel sprouts.  They were fried and tossed with jack daniels, blue cheese and bacon!  Over the top delicious.  For our second visit we had the chocolate mousse which was average at best.  Sort of rudimentary flavor, texture and presentation.  We certainly finished it but it didn't blow me out of the water either.  Just Applebee's or Olive Garden quality at best.  I will say our drinks took forever as well.  We could plainly see our server waiting at what appeared to be a pick up area for cocktails and also observed the bartender taking her time as if she had not a care in the world.  The drinks taking ten minutes would be understandable if the restaurant was busting at the seams and busy but this was not at all the case.  If anything there were quite a few open tables and maybe less than 12 people at the bar.  A glass of wine and a beer shouldn't take that long. One of the two positive things about Ten Penny is their extensive selection of microbrews on draft and their HUGE wine list.  While I haven't lived in Pittsburgh my whole life I have yet to find a spot with such an impressive array of wines by the bottle/glass and a constantly changing draft selection.  If nothing else I would come back just for the wine and beer selection.  The second positive highlight was our server:  her wine recommendations and beer descriptions were incredibly accurate.  It was a wonderful surprise and probably the highlight of our meal to have a server who was professional, polite, didn't hover too much but was more than able to answer our questions about the food and offer progressive, trendy pairing ideas for our meal.  Next time I'll return, look for the nice woman (I think it was Rosa or Raye?) who waited on us and just get a bottle of wine.  As per the food, the chef really needs to step it up especially with so many other incredible restaurants in the downtown area offering food that is far more delicious for the same prices as Ten Penny.",

How about a slight smile and a \"Happy Anniversary,\" I know you can read the reservation screen.  The wait staff was flying around, but not accomplishing much of anything.  My glass sat empty longer than it contained a tasty brew.  The food seemed prepackaged, I imagined the calamari being dumped out of a large plastic bag and into the deep fryer.  The Lamb Shank came out fast... too fast... as if it was waiting, let's say, under a heat lamp.  The Brussel Sprouts were OK, but there are much better in Pittsburgh.  Bright side was the beer list, they did have some great beers and plenty of seasonals available.  Maybe someday the food and service will catch up to the atmosphere and, more importantly, the bill.",

The crispy brussel sprouts were good but too much sauce, I would have liked them plainer and crispier.  The calamari was over breaded and not to my liking and for these reasons i gave it a 3 star. Would I go back, not sure, due to price mostly when there are many other options without having to spend so much. With dessert my bill came for one person, no drinking involved, to over $43 which is a little high to me! Dessert was nice, the apple tart, but the Ice Cream was overly liquored, again, for me.

It's frustrating when a restaurant basically only offers salad, a risotto, and a pasta primavera as the vegetarian options....so boring! Not sure if the meat options were any more inspired.

The waiter came to check on me and I told him that this was not as described on the menu.  So, he begrudgingly brought me fries back out and acted like I did not know how to read a menu. When I inquired why there was no meat, he actually lied to me and indicated that I would have to pay more for the meat.  When I got my bill, I was charged $14 for a bed of lettuce.  So I went up to the hostess and reviewed the menu which indicated that I should have received everything else on the salad at no extra charge.  The manager did give me my lunch for free but the fact that the waiter blatantly lied to me and then tried to tell the manager that it was a big misunderstanding really left a bad taste in my mouth.

Unfortunately the service and food were not very good. For our apps, the meatball was excellent, but the Brussels sprouts were mushy and soaked in sweet sauce that tasted like syrup. For our entrees we had the mussels which had no sauce or seasoning at all, just dry plain mussels. We also had the catfish. The catfish itself was good but the hush puppies were terrible as they were dried out and hard. The chicken with kale wasn't good either.  The kale was so salty and spicy we couldn't eat it. The service was poor too. While we did get our food in a reasonable time, our service was not good. We sat with empty drinks and water for 15-20 mins and watched the waiter walk by several times. When we tried to get his attention he kept walking. We had to go to the bar to get drinks for our table. Every glass and plate was still on our table when we paid for our bill as nothing was cleared from our table the whole time we were there. It is not a wonder that the bar ran out of wine glasses and ended up serving our white wine in a tumbler!  To top it all off, we watched an employee use the washroom and leave without washing their hands!  I would not go back.  There are lots of other restaurants in the area I would go to instead.",

It's near my office, so we have gone a few times to celebrate special events. They always get one person's order wrong. As a former waiter, I understand how hard it is to serve a large party, but every time? The real reason I'm not going back is because they overcharged us. One co-worker and I ordered their (delicious) grilled cheese and tomato soup and asked for a side salad. The menu says \"Choice of Side +3). They charged us $8 each for our salad. Since one person usually pays for the group and we divide later, we didn't find out until the next day. A call to the restaurant didn't give us the benefit of the doubt, so they'll get my extra five bucks, but never again my business.",

    "text": "Ten Penny is currently my favorite downtown eatery - the way I see it, any place that makes me want to devour a bowl of Brussels sprouts at least deserves that title.  Let me explain. I'd been introduced to Ten Penny for a holiday party and sampler last year, and had wanted to return for a full meal ever since. When I finally did, I was not disappointed. For starters, without a huge party taking over the joint I was able to appreciate just how lovely this place is. There's the bar area up front, with rustic but comfy looking tables further back, plus full booths alongside the windows. The result of the additional decorated shelves and even their roofwork is a pretty trendy looking and comfortable space to eat a meal in.  I can't voice a single complaint about the servers here, either. Our waiter during the meal was fantastic; from the moment we sat down he was there pouring out glasses of water, checking our drinks, and just generally making sure everything was ok. He had nothing to worry about though: everything was MUCH better than ok! Our cocktails - a cucumber and gin mix, plus a Junipear drink - were the perfect way to start dinner, offering a kick of sweet or semi-tart flavor that helped jumpstart our appetites.   Choosing what I wanted was actually incredibly difficult - Ten Penny has a menu built entirely of out delicious ingredients and combinations, which makes you wish you could have a bite of everything. At first I thought I'd stick to the main menu, but after some discussion with our waiter I ended up choosing one of their specials: a flatbread topped high with salmon, white cheddar, onions, peppers, and spinach. So. GOOD! This flatbread practically melted in my mouth with every delicious creamy bite I took. I'm honestly kind of sad that this isn't a main staple, because even if I matched the ingredients and cooked the salmon in the same fashion they did, I know I still wouldn't be able to replicate this perfection in my own oven. Fortunately, from sampling my dining partner's food I know that some of their staples are just as good. Their single meatball appetizer, for example, was an incredibly juicy pile of meaty goodness, topped with marinara sauce that I really can only describe as \"zesty\" and \"tangy\". This really was the sauce that every ad you've ever seen for sauce thought it was selling you. And oh yes: the bowl of Brussels sprouts. Incredibly enough, these may have been my favorite part of the meal. No joke! These are a must-taste, even if you normally hate Brussels sprouts. Trust me, they make these good. Granted, the balsamic glaze, bacon, and blue cheese that they stack onto them may have something to do with just how much I loved them; I can't be sure. ;) But they were by far the biggest and best surprise of the meal.  Honestly, I really can't emphasize how delicious and perfect Ten Penny is. Put simply, I left full, happy, and without a complaint in the world - an admittedly rare state of being for me. So I'm definitely looking forward to my next fabulous meal and experience here!",

    "text": "I meet a friend for lunch today at Ten Penny. What a pleasant time! The place wasn't very crowded at all which was inducive for conversation. With the weather being nice the windows were removed offering an open feel to the dining area and the atmosphere inside had a comfortable yet rustic feel to it. Our waitress was courteous and professional.  It didn't take long for us to decide on what we wanted. My friend ordered the special of the day, some sort of flatbread with sausage and I went with the Cuban Reuben. I took a quick gander at the drink menu for a possible future happy hour outing and noticed that there was a wide variety of drinks and wines, if that's your thing, along with enough craft beers to keep things interesting for me.   Our plates arrive quickly; maybe five minutes or so.  My sandwich was very good with a good portion of pulled pork under the slaw and melted swiss cheese on a warm and slightly toasted baguette. I was treated to a little sample of my friend's flatbread and it was equally delicious. For a restaurant being in the Cultural District and for the quality of the meal that we enjoyed, I'd say the total amount of the check was very reasonable. The tab even came with a little chocolate \"coin\" that had \"Ten Penny\" imprinted on the gold foil wrapper... nice added touch.  From my experience I can't see any reason why Ten Penny doesn't deserve a five star rating.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Downtown lunch.",

    "text": "The only thing saving this from a 1 star review is the fact that the manager applied a discount to each and every once of our separate checks after we complained about the food.  Unfortunately, if the manager had been there from the get-go, maybe everything would have run more smoothly in the first place.  Staff was slow and seemingly uninterested in making our experience stellar.  Our server was the only saving grace at least in terms of attitude.  That said, I don't know if it was his fault or the kitchen's that multiple orders came out wrong, had to be sent back and did not come out correctly until the rest of us had finished eating.  I could see my hungry friends looking more and more anxious with each passing minute.  The food itself was average at best.  The $18 smoked salmon benedict was one of the biggest wastes of money I've ever ordered at a restaurant.  Tiny pieces of salmon that did not taste that fresh, bland and congealed hollandaise sauce and cold eggs.  We also split the carrot cake pancakes which I found delicious but others were less impressed.  Every single one of our plates came out cold to lukewarm.  A couple positives: the atmosphere is great and the location is prime.  Also, their draft beer selection is awesome but the bartenders were not knowledgeable enough to offer recommendations and the menu was badly outdated so you had basically no idea what type of beer you may want to try.",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst meals I have ever had in my life...and it had nothing to do with the food! Ended up going in with a party of 17. The horrible management thought it would be a good idea to put one server on this large party. First mistake. The server took our drink order. Out of 17 drinks, only 5 of them were correct. I ordered ginger ale, for I have been in recovery for over 10 years. I get my ginger ale, or what I thought, that was filled with vodka and a splash of ginger ale. Second mistake. Our food order was taken and it took over an hour to get our food. Before the food came, my father ordered a vodka tonic with extra lime. He got a vodka soda with lemon. What seasoned bartender garnishes a vodka and tonic or soda with lemon? He went up to the bar to ask for another and the bartender gave him such an attitude. She personally brought the drink to the table and slammed it on the table and walked away. Third mistake. If she worked in my restaurant, I would have fired her on the spot. When we went to the manager, the completely supported their horrible bartender. I guess customer services isn't one of the managers or staffs strong suits. The bartender who made the drinks had her long hair down and was twirling it in between drinks. Sounds like a health department call! To the bartender with the attitude - you're an amateur, if that, bartender in a hole in the wall place in pittsburgh. What a winner you are lady. To take a line from Samantha Bee - learn how to make a vodka tonic with lime, freckless ****! STAY AWAY from horrible service!",

    "text": "I went here for brunch with 8 other people, and we had a mixed experience.  On the high end, the peanut butter and jelly biscuit was truly delicious and delightful.  On the low end, the staff didn't really seem to care whether my friend lived or died.  I'll explain.  Two members of our party are gluten intolerant (one has food sensitivity issues severe enough that he's been hospitalized for them before).  We explained the situation to our waiter and asked which items were gluten-free.  He seemed unsure, and after a bit of discussion, he promised to ask the kitchen and return with a complete list.  He was gone for a while, which we took to mean he was being thorough, as there were about as many occupied tables as there were waiters at the moment.  He came back and asked, \"Everyone ready to order?\"  We responded, \"Uh, we're still waiting on the list of gluten-free items...\" and he politely apologized for not getting that and disappeared again.  He came back and mentioned some items which were gluten-free.  One person asked, \"are the grits gluten-free?\"  To which he replied, \"I think so?  I mean, I'm pretty sure it is.\"  At this point we were annoyed, and one friend calmly explained that you wouldn't carry a grenade around if you were only \"pretty sure\" it wasn't about to explode, so given the health risk, would he please go check with the kitchen.  He came back with another \"whoops\"--turns out it's NOT a gluten free dish, and good thing we didn't just take his word for it.  He then promised to keep in constant contact with the kitchen about the situation to make sure no more slip-ups or miscommunications happen.  One of the two gluten-sensitive people decided at this point to just not order anything and get a meal afterwards, while the more sensitive person was very hungry and figured after 2-3 separate information-sharing trips to the kitchen, things had to be in order by now.  So he ordered the smoked salmon--which the waiter said was definitely gluten-free (no uncertainty, yay)--and the rest of us placed our orders.  At this point we were all starving, as things had been progressing painfully slowly (we would have considered the service slow had the restaurant been crowded; with it practically empty, we didn't know what was going on).  The orders came out.  A bunch of them were wrong.  Mostly minor issues.  A missing ingredient here, an extra ingredient there, one entire entree nobody ordered (one extra is better than one missing, I suppose, though hardly an efficient way to run a business).  But my gluten-intolerant friend noticed something about his smoked salmon, which he had been assured was gluten-free (by a waiter who supposedly checked with the kitchen 2 or 3 times and promised to monitor the situation in the kitchen to make sure no cross-contamination occurred).  THEY SERVED IT ON BREAD.  (Well, a bread product, to be specific, some kind of toast/cracker/bread/crostini/whatever.)  The waiter apologized and offered to have the kitchen make a new one, but at this point no one trusted his word or the kitchen.  So we sat there, the rest of us eating our inaccurately prepared food quickly so our friends could move on to the now-necessary second-brunch of the day (at this point it didn't seem worth reminding anyone that I had said \"no onion\" but still received onion in my so-so omelette).  The waiter apologized again when he brought the check, but I also thought it was odd that we didn't hear anything else about the issue.  No manager came out to apologize, no compensation for trying to poison a customer, not even an explanation of how that could possibly happen (despite how clear we were and how certain we made sure the waiter was) or how they'd make sure it wouldn't happen again.  So yeah, the peanut butter biscuit was delicious.  I still hope they go out of business.  A new restaurant opening up in the same location is the only way I'll ever walk through those doors again.",

We were seated at a booth that is two steps up from the main dining area.  The overall space of the place is a nice size.  There are plenty of tables, booths and seats around the bar.  The interior is trendy as my wife stated.  It really is a nice space and the lighting is a little 'lower' to give it a more cozy feel.  Our server was very friendly, prompt, efficient and polite.  He made suggestions based on our asks and his recommendations were spot on.  The drink selection is aplenty.  They have a fully stocked bar, about 15 beers on tap (this is estimated as I forgot to actually count) and ample wine.  They also have a Bloody Mary menu as well, but I opted for a beer as did the other guests in my party.  The brunch menu offered a decent amount of items.  The menu includes, salads, omelets, flatbread pizzas, soups, burgers and some other sandwiches.  I had the Margarita flatbread with pizza.  It was pretty good, nothing exceptional, but still tasty.  My wife had the omelette with home fries and found it to be really good.   I would recommend this place for brunch for sure.  The price is fairly moderate too, so no issues there.  After my experience, I would definitely come back for lunch and or dinner.",

The brussel sprouts, special flatbread, and mac n cheese were delicious and had a unique mix of flavors, but the Mushroom flatbread was absolutely delicious, probably the most tasty thing I've had in the city since my meal at Meat N Potatoes.  The service, at first the service was a bit aggressive, we were constantly asked if we were ready to order entrees despite making it clear we were going to order a bunch of sharables, but the lady was nice overall, just very attentive to a fault.   The kitchen did forget our soups at one point, which honestly wasnt a big deal at all as the soup was worth the wait, it was light, creamy, and absolutely delicious (Cream of Asparagus), despite our party really being fine with the small mistake and not caring, the management took care of us and were very apologetic for what we viewed as a something not even major.  5 star service and food, will def be back and sharing with out of towners.",

    "text": "As a self-identified foodie, I'd just like to say I am sooooooo disappointed. So very disappointed.   We've never been here, so we made a reservation for 5 through Open Table. As always I specified in the reservation that someone in the party had a gluten allergy and asked that the server be prepared to talk about gluten-free options. That request was TOTALLY ignored. But that's not even the worst of it.   Party of 5, Friday night around 8:30....while our server was extremely nice, there were long distances in between our interaction with her. I don't blame here, but rather think that they should hire more people. But that's not the worst of it.   I got the cranberry mojito, which I swear didn't have alcohol in it. It was so watered down I could have used it to wash my face. Sent it back (which I hate to do), got another one -- same thing BUT with more juice. Pitiful.   Another drink issue--you can't get the mule unless you pay $18 for the cup. Yes, you get to keep the cup. Kinda like GetGo, but pricier. Pitiful.   The worst part: the food was HORRIBLE. Only one person in our party was happy about their meal. ONE person out of 5. I ordered the braised lamb shank and polenta. What came to me looked like a big microwaved ham hock drenched in gravy. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating. I cut -- no I saw-ed through it, and literally had to fight to peel back a half-inch layer of fat all around the \"shank.\" When I did find a piece of meat I had to saw it off of the bone. By this time, my plate is a mess, the \"braised lamb shank\" was just swirling around in this sea of gravy-mixed polenta. Disgusting.   I hate being \"that girl\" at a restaurant. But I had to go there. The server was very accommodating, and was NOT surprised at all by my disgust of the \"lamb shank.\" I just ordered a burger and called it a day. It was removed from the bill, but they certainly charged me for my burger.   For this price point, I expected a lot more. Instead I spent a lot, and had slop for dinner.   Should have gone to The Commoner.",

    "text": "I had lunch here with a friend & definitely won't be back. My friend ordered the \"caesar salad\" which was literally 1 wedge of lettuce about as big as her fist with some dressing on it and 1 piece of cold bacon on the side. This should not even count as an appetizer, let alone a meal item. I didn't look at the price, but I'd assume it was on the same page with the rest of the salads, which were about $10 - $14. She had to go somewhere else to pick up something else to eat after we left.  I ordered a chopped salad, which was about as good as a gas station salad. I may have even had a better salad from a convenience store/gas station before. The salad was mostly crappy iceberg lettuce with some peas, tiny pieces of unripe tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, with about an eighth of a teaspoon of crumbled bacon & 4 fried onion pieces. It was supposed to have a garlic vinaigrette on it, but I tasted no dressing on it whatsoever. The \"grilled turkey\" in it was about a tablespoon or 2 of tiny, tiny turkey cubes. And this salad was $12. This place is a rip off, and just not good.",

    "text": "I've been to Ten Penny once when it first opened about two years ago and unfortunately it wasn't a particularly good experience. Being that it was two years ago I chalked that experience up to new restaurant growing pains and my boyfriend and I decided to give it another try yesterday for Valentine's Day. They were one of the few restaurants downtown with an available table and as we learned, it was for good reason.   Before digging into where it went wrong, I'd like to mention some of the good - the decor and atmosphere is great. They paid a lot of attention to detail, the restaurant has a chic modern industrial design and comes complete with monogrammed dinnerware. The draft list is also quite large with a good selection of breweries and styles.   The problems started from the minute we walked in the door, we weren't greeted or acknowledged by the staff for at least 5 minutes, despite a crowd of them being gathered by a terminal no more than arm's length from us at the door. After being seated, the service was also quite slow and disorganized despite only about a third of the restaurant being filled.   The food was also a big disappointment, for the holiday they swapped out their normal menu for a much more limited Valentine's Day menu plus two of their burgers. Our meatball appetizer was simply ok, nothing all that impressive. Both of us ordered their signature burger as nothing on the menu really appealed to us. Both burgers were oozing with grease and lacking in taste. We finished the night with the chocolate cherry whiskey bar (a small dessert for $12) that could only be described as inedible.   Considering the selection of restaurants in the city, I'm really not sure how they managed to stay around this long. This place could be much better than it is if they decided to focus on improving their service and their menu.",

    "text": "Ten Penny is a very nice addition to the mid range/high end food scene in Pittsburgh. It's located right across from the Greyhound terminal, so not in the choicest part of downtown, but it does make it relatively easier to find parking! Just as an FYI - they do have valet, it's $10 (steep!) that you pay on the spot, and then if you eat at the restaurant, they refund you $3 off your bill. Kind of weird, if you ask me.  Interior decor is very much in line with Cure and Pig and Chicken, with the warmed up industrial wood/reclaimed iron/brick aesthetic. What I liked about it was that it was spacious, and thus, probably can accommodate larger parties (unlike Cure) and also the noise level was manageable. So, a very comfortable, informal place to have good food and good drink. Service is friendly!  They have a very extensive wine menu, and very knowledgeable staff to help you make your choice. We actually tried three different wines before settling on one. It was very nice of them to be so willing to try and make sure we got something we really liked.   Food was good, but not exceptional. We started with the mushroom flatbread (fine) and crabcakes (good!). Three of us had the filet, which was a seriously large hunk of meat. Very tender, but I felt as though mine was a bit underseasoned, even though it came with a nice demi-glaze sauce. The filets came with sides of brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes, both of which could have used more salt. The other person in our party had the duck, which was also good, but not out of this world.  We tried two desserts: the dessert special, which was a hazelnut tart, and the bombe off the usual dessert menu. The bombe was truly the bombe - definitely recommend it.  All in all, a success. Would definitely come back again!",

Presentation was very nice, flavor was good but would have been better if it had been served hot not lukewarm. Next my husband tried the Gumbo...no complaints here! I ordered a steak may husband ordered the pork chop. His chop came with smoked Gouda polenta which was served COLD! A female manger was walking around and checking on tables. When she stopped at our table we told her about our displeasure with the temperature that our food was served. She replaced the polenta and took the calamari off of our check. We paid our bill and was getting ready to leave when a waiter carrying some other guests dinner smacked me in the forehead with the plate of food. Even though it was an accident he it me hard enough that I saw stars and immediately got dizzy. The table beside us kept saying we need a manager over here now! After a few minutes, I went to the restroom to check on my forehead. The general manager, Craig Lydon, was speaking with my husband when I returned. We agreed this was an accident, However, he never asked for my information to follow up with me. He did ask us several times what we wanted him to do. Our thoughts were...you are the general manager you should know what you should do! He told us he was sorry and gave us a $25 gift card to pay for part of our meal when we come back.  Accidents happen but he should have comped our meal and given us at least a $75 gift card to come back. By the way, my forehead is still tender two days later!",

Reserving a table through their website was quick and simple, and even when I had to go back and add another person to the reservation I didn't have any issues.  First off, the atmosphere is awesome. The whole restaurant has a very relaxed vibe to it, and I enjoyed the fact that you could see everything outside through the large windows surrounding the room. The only thing I will say is not to go if you need a nap due to the dim lighting, and the seats for the booth tables were so soft you sank into them and felt like a kid at the adult table.   The food was fantastic. I got their Stuffed Chicken breast, and a shared order of the mussels. Both of which I thought were perfect.   One of my favorite things however were their cocktails. I only tried their Pricky Pear Margarita, but everything on the menu sounded really interesting, so I can't wait to go back.",

I ordered the Pork Chip Entree served with whipped potatoes and Asparagus. The Pork was cooked PERFECTLY! The seasoning on the pork chop was just enough to add flavor, but not over powering. For dessert I was split between the Smores and the seasonal ice cream.  I got both, and they were good. The presentation of the Smores was pretty interesting. You got all the parts as well as a flaming cauldron to make your own Smores!! The 3 for 5 was a great deal and could've been for two.

I was a little alarmed that they didn't offer separate forks for the raw meat and seafood.   My kids both ordered the strip steak.  I suppose they thought they could serve the kids a subpar piece of meat, but I was still paying $32 per plate.  Ordered it medium rare- steak was tough and cold and gross in the middle.   The potatoes were enjoyable as was the calamari.    Our waiter was aloof and rarely returned to check on us.  Possibly the worst part of the evening was the fact that the valet LEFT OUR CAR ON in front of the restaurant.  I would return for happy hour.

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere of this place, the decor is great, the food and drinks are all very good, and the wait staff for table service, as well as the hostesses here have always been very pleasant. No complaints there.  Pittsburgh needs more places catering to hip crowds, without being stereotypical \"hipster\" - and I think TenPenny accomplishes that incredibly well. Everything in my body says \"love this place!\" except for...wait for it... the bartenders... who leave a really negative impression unfortunately, despite making delicious concoctions.   I give them credit for making great drinks and getting them to customers fairly quickly. But the personalities, quite frankly... and I'm generalizing here based on a few interactions with maybe 2-3 different tenders... suck.  I have been here on a handful of occasions and let me just recap my experiences at the bar specifically... with a handful of quotes and explanations:  -- \"Sweetie,  you're going to have to show some ID\" (I'm 30 - flattered they ask, but be kind please, I'm not a child, nor your sweetie) -- (at 12:45am on a Saturday with a full bar as we walk in) \"Hey it's last call just so you know. We can only serve you one drink but then you gotta leave\" -- Same night, taking candles off the bar to signal to patrons they should skiddaddle... at 1am. Still a full bar. --Same night around 1:15am (bar is about 3/4 full) -- nice couple walks in and comes up next to us to make their way to the bar for a drink order. They're turned down as the tenders tell them they're not taking orders any longer. The couple leaves.  Different night... Me asking for clarification on a drink: \"So it's kinda similar to a Moscow Mule then?\" Bartender: (insert condescending laugh...) \"not at all. So is that what you want?\"  Different night after work - empty tables that were probably reserved for a later event that evening - very crowded bar... I was there with about 6 coworkers. Bartender tells my friend as he serves him a drink that we can't be leaning on the table that's reserved and that we need to stand somewhere else. We complied even though annoyed, and stayed for another hour. The tables still were not in use when we left.  Just <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FICK.com&s=111f520c7ebc1ea676b592e82f7031a08e7105b7bf32d26ae1e7f7c8ee712494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ICK.com</a> all around. You can't treat customers as though they're an inconvenience OR like you're better than them. It won't get you far. Bartenders can make or break a bar scene, and unfortunately each time I leave this place I wonder \"why do I keep coming back?\"  What makes a place LAST is their people.  I keep hoping the next time will be better. I plan to go back for dinner service (again, always great), but I think I should probably stop going to the bar.... would recommend others consider the same.  Good luck!",

This place actually makes me sad- it's amazing decor and vibe- great location and the food was seriously impressive. However- might have been one of the worst experiences with service I've ever had. We got there at 7:20 to have dinner before the fireworks at 9:30, we had a reservation as well. After we were seated had to hunt down our server multiple times just to get drinks or place an order, etc. Also, once we ordered drinks they always came 30-40 min after we ordered from a bartender whom I'm willing to bet is not a bartender. The restaurant could have made probably 2 rounds more of drinks from us if they had been quicker or asked. At one point we ordered shots thinking that would be fast- nope... 30mn. Also, we didn't actually get our food until 9:27pm so we had to scarf it down to make our destination. Waiting for delicious food wouldn't be that bad if you had a drink in your hand. The place wasn't busy either- we were one of 3-4 tables so I have no idea why everything was taking so long. Would I come back? Nope. Good service goes a long way- even though the food was killer- I don't have hours to kill waiting on it to come to me and in the mean time have a frustrating experience trying to be noticed or get drinks.

The menu changes, but always has a wide range of unique and staple choices. The wine and beer selection is great as well, but my favorite part of this place is the atmosphere - it takes me right back to NYC's Lower East Side :-)   The staff has always been great - we even had a glass accidentally get knocked over on our table, but the server was extremely embarrassed and the manager comped one of the entrees from our bill, even though we didn't ask for it or make a stink about the glass.   This is definitely a local favorite and somewhere you can bring friends, family or a hot date to and be sure to have a great time!",

I figured it would have been a little busier for the day and time, but there was plenty of bar seating.   The hostess was VERY friendly. a tad over whelming in the friendly department, but you don't see that much no a days any way so good for her.   Anyways, I sat at the bar and the bar tender was friendly and prompt.   For lunch I got the Portobello Sandwich with fries. IT WAS PERFECT!! I loved it. The fries were cooked at perfect crispiness. I cant wait to come back with friends and try all the apps, especially the truffle fries.",

I do believe the mega meatball is overrated. It just was very plain and nothing special. That being said, the service was amazing! Our waitress noticed that I hadn't eaten the meatball and didn't want to take it home so she didn't charge me for it. Definitely made up for the fact that I didn't enjoy it! Will be back to try something else!",

    "text": "Went here for a gathering with friends around on New Years Eve Eve. It was pretty quiet as I'm sure most were gearing up for the next night. Overall, it was perfect for our gathering.   The atmosphere is cool but relaxed. There was good music. It was like a familiar playlist of 90s music--loud enough for you to hear, but not so loud that you had to shout over it. Our server did a good job of keeping up with our drinks and things. The cocktails took a while to make. Maybe it was a new bartender or they were understaffed? Considering the light crowd, drinks should have come a little faster.  I liked their beer list and they have some interesting cocktails. A pumpkin/maple whiskey drink didn't really work for me -- and they were apparently out of the preferred whiskey. I also tried a drink with cucumber and pickle juice. Sounds crazy, but I like pickles. The only good thing about this one was that it made me sip slow -- saving me money and my friends from seeing me get too crazy!  The TP No. 1 Cup was the best drink I sampled and I would order it again. Doesn't pack much punch, though.  For food, the meal was satisfying, but not incredibly memorable. There are a lot of options, so I think you can expect everyone to find something that they will enjoy. The appetizers were more interesting than the entrees. Nothing was bad, but I just wanted a little more excitement for the price on some of the entrees.  Overall, I liked this place, but considering I'm only in town once or twice a year anymore, I'd try a few more places before coming back. But if someone suggested it again, I'd go along. I'd prefer it for drinks and apps and then maybe try dinner some place else.",

The male bartender didn't bother to wipe the bar when we sat.   The drink he made me was somehow made incorrectly and although he made me a new one it was just as bad.   And in between time, he got several others their drink first.   A manager never came over to check on us, which in most restaurants someone would have and possibly offered to comp a drink or give another one complimentary.    Needless to say we won't be back.",

It was a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was half full. We were greeted and seated by a very nice young man. It took a few minutes for our waitress to come. We realized it was only her, the host, the bartender, and a bus boy working. I don't think they were expecting the over flow from the convention center. The manager was helping to serve.  I loved the interior at Ten Penny. It was very cozy yet you could people watch. I ordered a Pittsburgh Salad and my friend ordered the Green Curry from the \"Late Lunch\" menu. My salad was very good. It had a Spring Mix instead of iceberg lettuce. The French fries were a mix of crispy and fluffy. I'm not a big Ranch dressing fan but I really liked theirs. My friend enjoyed her Green Curry a lot. We both were happy that our flat bottled water was chilled. A lot of places serve it room temperature.  Though our waitress was crazy busy I thought she did a great job and was very friendly. I definitely want to come back and try their dinner menu.",

    "text": "We stopped by Ten Penny on Saturday night for dinner and the service was pretty terrible.  We did not have a reservation but the hostess was quite accommodating and pleasant. Because there was a small wait we went to the bar to grab a drink. Service was SLOW. Once our table was ready we tried to flag down the bartender and he refused to attend to us despite not being busy or making other people's drinks. We were trying to close our tab but he seemed in no hurry to assist us so we left and went to our table.   Once we sat down our server was clearly over worked and frantic. Service was again slow. Our first course (calamari) came out and was cold. Now I don't normally complain about the temperature of food, and calamari isn't something I expect to be steaming hot, but this was cold, like it had been sitting out for an extended period of time before being served. Once we started eating I realized we didn't have any napkins or silverware. I politely asked another server if she could grab us some since our server was no where to be found and she responded so rudely and said \"yea I'm looking for some for a ton of other people\". While this might be True, no need for the sass and no need to tell a paying customer that you can't find sliver wear. Just tell me you're going to go find some.   Once our dinner arrived my mom's meal was completely wrong. She ordered a salad and the pork belly sliders and the salad never came and the pork belly sliders were chicken. When we told the server about the pork not actually being pork she apologized and asked if she could get us new ones and that she would take the sliders off the bill. The sliders were so poorly done my mom couldn't even eat them. Luckily her salad finally came and she was able to eat that.  The most shocking part, however, came about 45 minutes after we had commented on the sliders and we were getting ready to pay. The server came up to our table and explained that she had talked to the kitchen and the sliders were in fact pork. She then kept the sliders on the bill. Regardless of what meat the sliders were, they were so terrible they could not be eaten. They may have been pork but they certainly were not prepared well and should have been taken off our bill. Additionally, the server never should have come up to us so long after to tell us we were wrong.   During our dinner I watched one table get up and leave because they received no service and another table have so many issues with their bill they had to keep going up to the hostess because the server was no where to be found. I will say that my meal (crab risotto) was delicious and the ambiance is great but I will think twice about returning to Ten Penny because the service really needs some work.",

Our entree took an hour, and during that hour we only saw our waitress once. However, there was a man in a suit with a clownish smile walking about the restaurant like a mouse in a maze holding his arm at a ninety degree angle as if there were a napkin hanging from it ready to sweep up some table crumbs. We assumed he was the manager, but we couldn't be sure because he didn't approach a table the entire time we were there.   End: the food was mediocre and over priced. We left with hungry bellies and light wallets.   The atmosphere was really cool, but we won't be back.",

However, he decided to assign us all a seat number by counting out loud and pointing---I was ready for a game of duck duck goose to follow. The incoherency continued well into the evening.   Overall the food was decent. Overpriced for appetizers but the decor and atmosphere was a plus. Bathrooms were clean which is always good in my book. For a downtown location the service should have been far better. Wouldn't run back there in a hurry.",

Bloody Mary selection for $10 seems like a pretty good deal. But some tasted very strange with various liquor in them.   Overall, I would not go back for brunch.   Prices are reasonable but for what you get, it would be better to go to eatin park, Pamela's, or even eleven for brunch   Spend more and enjoy your food.

When we pointed out that we only got two bar drinks and not four and questioned why we were charged for soda refills there was no apology from our waitress, just a quick \"I'll fix it\" and she walked away. Although there is no way to know for sure, it felt like she was inflating our tab without us noticing in hopes of securing a bigger tip judging by the way she reacted to the whole incident. Our mac and cheese tasted like nothing. I felt like I was eating plain noodles. The chicken and waffles were so-so. The only saving grace was that we enjoyed our Brussels sprouts appetizer. There are way too many good places to eat in this part of town. Don't waste your time here",

    "text": "The whole bar and restaurant area is very nice, industrial and modern.  Unfortunately the positives stop there.  I have been there 3x now and the service has stunk every time.  I'm not sure why they can't get competent wait and bar staff.  Our drinks were off, the appetizers were supremely underwhelming, and we were too scared off at that point to order entrees.  The poor waiter we had (who was average on his best day) had way too many tables.  We were there for a good 15 minutes before we even got waters.  Cocktails took another 20 minutes.  Appetizers came out on time but were average at best (think Applebee's).    I could go on but I won't.  We left in a \"huff\" because we were able to secure reservations at a competing place around the corner.  The entire restaurant is packed with potential.  There's no reason why it's not a hot place on Penn.  Management needs to be put under the microscope.  Everything trickles down from there....",

    "text": "Wow where do I start.  Great food, service, location and drinks. Visiting the Pittsburgh area for a weekend getaway from Jersey. We stumbled upon this place using a Google search and couldn't have been happier. This place has amazing drinks and the food was beyond amazing.  I'm a big seafood person and calamari is a must as an appetizer but was told via comments to stir clear of the calamari so I went with the Mussels which were just ok for me. The wine sauce I believe was a little bland but the mussels were cooked well. The drinks we ordered were extremely strong and delicious so that made up for the appetizer.  My entree was freaking AMAZING being a noodle guy. I was completely thrown off when I saw this on the menu so next trip I'm definitely getting this again.  Overall great experience. Word to the wise make sure you make a reservation unless you arrive early before the evening rush. We arrived around 6:30-7:00 so we didn't have to wait.",

    "text": "After coming here once and having an awesome experience with Rich, the bartender, I decided to return with my boyfriend for a late night bite to eat last night (7-31-2015).  The bar was full, so we decided to get a table. The hostess was friendly and accommodating.   The first lady that waited on us (long blond hair) was not very polite at all.  Not only am I hard of hearing to begin with, it was pretty loud in there. I didn't hear a question she asked, and in a very insulting tone, she said: \"I SAID, what would you like to EAT?\"   At first, I assumed she was simply raising her voice in order to make herself audible, but her generally snotty attitude persisted. It seemed like she was having a bad night for reasons not having to do with us, but that it was being taken out on us. We didn't feel very welcome at that point.   We are generally laid-back and understanding people, and have worked in the food service industry, but were unable to excuse her implicit rude gestures, such as a lack of friendliness, overtones of sarcasm, and annoyed facial expressions.  After our food order was taken, another server took over, and she was great (brown hair, glasses)! She really knew her wines, her presentation of our wine was done with utmost professionalism, and she was so friendly!  The truffle fries are amazing. The rosemary aioli has a subdued taste, perfectly balancing out the robust flavor of the fries.  The burgers are huge, juicy, and were cooked perfectly to our requested temps. My boyfriend had the Ten P burger, and I had the traditional one. We each loved our meal.  The Chamisal unoaked Chardonnay has been my favorite Chardonnay out of the 3 I've tried. If you avoid soft after-tastes such as vanilla or creme brulee and aim more for a crisp, drier flavor, this is a good one to try.  I'm only visiting, but I would be happy to return here when I am in Pittsburgh next!",

    "text": "I went to an event at the convention center and the group I was with decided to come here on a whim for brunch. It was just before 1pm or a little after. I was excited for this place. We were seated at a table for four on the other side of the bar. I noticed it wasn't very busy at all. I absolutely loved the layout and how they took advantage of the space. Everything from the choice of lighting to the shelves was appealing. The booths looked so comfy, but I didn't get a chance to sit in one this time.  Our waitress came over pretty quickly and gave us water. I ordered hot tea. The lady who brought me my tea cup set down a dirty one with someone's lipstick stain still on the cup. I quickly pointed it out and she gave me another one. I was kind of suspicious the rest of the time of all my silverware and any plate that was put in front of me. It looks like that was a one time deal this visit.  I did like the menu options and thought it was creative and interesting enough. I ordered eggs benedict with salmon. After someone took our order, it took so long for it to come out. By that time the place started to fill up a bit. I think we didn't start eating until close to 2 or a bit after. Two people at my table had salads and the other person got a flat bread. We kept looking at each other like \"where is the food\". After I got my order I asked for ketchup for my potatoes and never received it. Instead of asking again I just ate without it because I was starving. The food was lukewarm leaning more towards cold.  I did think the plate would be somewhat bigger and that's probably because of my experience at other brunches. Each side of the English muffin had one piece of salmon on it (which was $6 extra...) and overall it was good. My potatoes were plain. I didn't taste any seasoning whatsoever but then again it could be my personal taste and not necessarily that they weren't seasoned.  Our waitress was friendly, the food took way too long, the atmosphere was chill and comfy, decor is fab, they had great music, and the food was tasty overall. I would like to try this place again and maybe go for an adult beverage and branch out on the menu.",

Now the burger special, it was bonafide delicious, no way around it, this was a seasonal option that included beef, bacon, gravy, a potato patty and a pretzel bun.... yum. The meatball flatbread was also quite tasty though it'll be too soft for some. The southern fried chicken salad was a great portion, and also relatively close to phenomenal. The potato soup didn't quite make history and came out cold, the coffee followed suit at lukewarm. It took forever to get silverware and we finished our appetizer before we got the promised plates. Follow up was necessary for any sort of refills and the dessert took so long it was like they were picking the apples fresh for the cobbler. The service was as friendly as it was slow, and it was very friendly. I would be very unlikely to return, probably best to spend your downtown dollars elsewhere since this place is also not cheap. It's unfortunate but whatever you do don't follow the menu, follow the reviews.",

The last time I was here I had the chicken and waffle sandwich special. The waffle was hard and crumbly, the chicken was dry and thick. Our drinks weren't refilled and we weren't checked on. We were with a party of 20 WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A PRIORITY. I spoke directly to a manager to get our issues straightened out. He was helpful this time, but was not last time. I will never come back again. So much for a second chance.",

The overall look of the restaurant is great. The brick and wood finishes really give a cozy, warm vibe.   My qualm is with the service and food selection. I'll start with the food. The first time I came with a group of about 8 before a concert. I think 2 out of the 8 people got the correct meal, and some didn't even have a meal come out. I got a flatbread pizza and split an order of the Brussels sprouts with my friend. My meal was good, overall, but I was one of the two who got the correct meal. The second time I came with a group of 18. They split us into two tables, which was perfect with such a large group. I went out on a limb and got the pork chop special and I was pretty happy with my choice. I will say that I'm never overly impressed with the menu options- but I am just one person.   The service both times was atrocious. Drinks were mixed up (we played \"pass the wine\" a few times until we all got what we actually ordered) and the overall service was incredibly slow. Checks were incorrect and jumbled to end the night.   Hopefully they sort out the serving issue because I do think the potential is there.",

We felt the warmth of the restaurant right when we walked in and were brought to our table with two comfortable leather couches that provided more than enough room for the two of us.   We were really in the mood to just order appetizers for our meal: cider braised pork belly (great taste, just wish it were a little more fatty), crispy calamari (yum), 1 lb. steamed PEI mussels (good, comes with garlic toast on top), and truffled French fries (good, comes in a pretty big portion with two sauces). These four appetizers filled us up and we even had some leftovers of fries!   Great atmosphere. Wooden ceilings, brick walls, and dozens of lights hanging from the ceiling in the main area. Pretty large bar area.   One note about service. Our server was fine for the most part, but we did notice that he seemed a little down. Not sure if that was just his personality or if he was having a less-than-ideal day. Regardless, it was still a good meal!   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4",

The Bad: meatballs were just okay, I've had better at more fast casual type places. Cocktails were alright; a little overly sweet but nothing too terrible.  Everything overall just seemed a bit overpriced for the quality.  The Ugly: the Lamb Chops. Oh my goodness...my poor friend got stuck with the lamb and it was really bad. It came out ice cold, and not cooked or seasoned well. She sent it back, and they came back out with a lamb that was slightly warmer, but still inedible. If you like lamb, do not order this one. It's a big turnoff on an otherwise lovely meat.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll definitely be skipping this place.",

I will certainly return.....and next time I'll make room for dessert!  Ten Penny....well done!",

It took 15 mins just to get the first round of drinks to to the table. When our entrees came out the didn't Clear the empty plates from the appetizers. It was like they were trying to solve a puzzle as to where they should place our sides. They didn't clear the appetizers until they put everything on the table. Oh! Almost forgot, the shared sides didn't come with serving utensils and the didn't give us new dining utensils with the entrees. Were we supposed to use our personal dirty utensils????  I will never come back here.",

I did not want to scare them off with my general distaste of establishments with either of those words in the name so I kindly obliged them. I had made it very apparent to them that I was not looking for a romantic relationship and I planned on paying for everything though as the night would go on they seemed to forget about that.  I have what some doctor's have called a \"super-liver\" which means that I can drink alcohol in much higher quantities than they average human or even sub-human. The highlight of this experience was their wine list which I moved through quite easily. My \"date\" had a a glass out of each of the bottles that I drank and appeared to be slightly \"toasted\" quite quickly. As for food I had the \"Mixed Greens\" salad style entree and the \"Roasted Jumbo Asparagus\" as well. I found both of these to taste nearly exactly as I had always read they would.   Our human service person showed us great attention and will surely be on their way to bigger and better things soon.  My date however did not keep their cool very well and I had to send them home in a \"LYFT\" style transport vehicle as I did not feel comfortable giving them a ride myself. I wouldn't say I am saving myself for marriage but I am not the Desertron particle accelerator some people in our society are.",

Our large group - at least 15 of us - spread out around over half the bar. I spent the first few minutes just staring at my surroundings. Like most amp'd group establishments, the restaurant is very well decorated with significant attention to detail. Ten Penny has a casual, rustic-industrial feel.  My review of food and drink unfortunately is limited. I tried to order a summer cocktail - I believe it was an enticing-looking sweet tea vodka sort of concoction? - but sadly it wasn't available for some reason. I settled for a different cocktail and my husband and I split the Ten Penny Candy Bar. Both were nice but didn't blow my mind. The cocktail was tasty while the candy bar was good but very hard to break apart and eat.",

    "text": "Ten Penny has SO much potential, which is why it pains me so much to write a two star review. The location is great, the decor is phenomenal, but the food and service fall short.  I came to Ten Penny for dinner on a weeknight before a show. The location is prime in the Cultural District, and I have to say - as soon as I walked in, I was very impressed. The hip decorations, high ceilings, and spacious dining area had me smitten. Unfortunately the dining experience just did not match the quality of the decor.  Prices are high, and the quality of the food was just subpar. I ordered a Caesar salad and a cup of the potato soup. I enjoyed both, but I felt that there was truly nothing special about them. I tasted a few of the dishes that my friends ordered and was not wowed by those either. I wish I had more to say, but in my opinion, there are much better food options in the Cultural District for these prices.  The service is what really drives me to give Ten Penny only two stars. Our waitress was nice and upbeat, but there were issues everywhere. Some of our girls ordered glasses of wine and were presented with a different type than ordered. When our food arrived, two girls ended up being left without entrees. They tried to explain to us that there was an error with the computers, but I felt terrible for the girls that had to wait even longer for their meals. At the end of the night, every single one of our checks was incorrect. I wish I was exaggerating. Many of the drinks we ordered were supposed to be on happy hour special, and all eight of our checks had to be adjusted before we paid.  I hope Ten Penny makes some changes, because this could be a restaurant with very high potential if they improve the food and the service (or at the very least, lower the prices).",

    "text": "I went here four times in three days and there are plenty of places to eat downtown, but this place does it right!  Was in town for the big race and had bookmarked this place after reading Darren W's 5-star review.  Came in on a Friday night and there were tables open but they said it would be 45 minutes to be seated.  We figured they must have been understaffed and just went somewhere else (and found out later that had been the case).  Came back Saturday afternoon for a couple of beers and sat at the bar.  The bartenders were cool, helpful and friendly.  My friend and I loved the vibe so we made reservations for brunch on Sunday after the race.    The place was packed on Sunday and our super waitress said the bar was a bit backed up, but we were tired and hungry and had no other plans, so we said \"no problem.\".  Libby was a dynamite waitress and everything that followed was great too.  I got a Bloody Mary flight, which was very interesting.  I liked the original best but I was glad for options.  We started with the smoked salmon, which was delicious (although you should provide four crostini if you have four pieces of salmon, IMO) and really raised my appetite.  We both had the breakfast flatbread which must be the world's greatest invention ever.  Perfectly done, in a human size portion, it wasn't as heavy as it sounded with sausage gravy, meat, onions and egg on it.  It was spectacular and I'm drooling now thinking about it.  It was a great meal.    Then Sunday evening, after having an unsatisfactory experience at Sienna Mercato (which looks like it could be cool if anyone actually waited on tables there), we were back at Ten Penny for dinner.  We had burgers and pizza (along with some beers) and again, it was great service, delicious food and a fun time.  I will definitely return to Ten Penny when I'm back in the 'burgh.  This is one of those places I would like to airlift intact to NYC and drop it on a nearby corner so I could go there regularly.",

Now, you can make you own decisions as to weather you want to take a chance on this place because WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!  We asked to speak to the manager (Craig, we were told his name) and were told two different stories as to why he couldn't see us ..saying that he was out of the building but yet his name is on the receipt that he cashed us out! Hmmmmm! Interesting!   To top it off! They only took $10.20 off for the $16.00 burger that I couldn't think of eating after seeing that bottle.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!   Stupid expensive too!! Definitely not worth paying $100. for 3 lunches!!!   Please, please, please, don't waste you money on this place. Take these remarks seriously and dine at one of the many other wonderful restaurants in the \"burgh\" that take pride giving you awesome service fantastic food and cleanliness is their top concern.   I will be putting a complaint in to the health department.",

The. Kale. It comes as a side with the panko crusted chicken, sub it out, for the love of God SUB IT OUT!  I've never been a fan of vegetables, it wasn't until later in life that I learned that vegetables are in fact grown in the ground and not manufactured in cans. Thanks, Mom. Who knew that vegetables could be crisp and flavorful?  Anywho, the \"kale\" was a lump of dark green mush with a horrible bitter flavor. We asked the waitress if it was canned, her manager assured her it was fresh. The waitress even commented that she always wondered why customers always left the \"kale\" on their plates after dinner... (cuz it's not kale) If it was in fact fresh, they must have boiled it for about 3 days. The lady at the table next to us didn't eat her \"kale\" either.   I'd definitely go back, their brussels sprouts appetizer and our meals were very good, minus that drain clogger they called \"kale.\"",

They barely had any beers on tap, had no Jack Daniels, but did make a pretty good Moscow mule. The food was mediocre at best. The meatball and Italian sausage sandwiches both seemed to have been microwaved, and the sausage was missing peppers and onions which would also be most of the ingredients. The crispy chicken sandwich was terrible. Side salads were good, I asked for balsamic and I got a tomato-y vinaigrette which was actually a good mistake. The price is a little high for what you're actually getting. I think the ambiance of Ten Penny makes it seem like a fancier restaurant, but the menu doesn't really reflect that. Sadly, there's much better options downtown!",

How about some entrees without all the la de da ingredients? I forced myself to order the pork ribs. They were very tender but the overwhelming mustard base made them unpalatable. Crab cakes looked deep fried and had too much filler and not enough Lump crab. Service was slow but given that the kitchen is on a lower level, it was understandable. Bad layout for the help. Probably a decent bar scene but I wouldn't ever come back to eat. Not my style. I like food on the tasty side. Protein oriented without overwhelming bitter sauces.",

    "text": "The dish that saved the experience was the filet mignon. It was truly one of the best prepared steak I have had in a while, definitely flavorful. The dishes experiment with flavor combinations that are great ideas need a little bit more tinkering for perfection.   Example: The rave of the crispy brussel sprouts where the balsamic glazing is a tad too sweet trying to offset the bacon and blue cheese, the mixed salad is literally lettuce draped in olive oil, no vinegar offset; and mega meetball, while good (sauce is fabulous) doesn't have much to compliment with the actual meet.   I must give my compliments to the waiter we had, he was excellent, just enough attention and marketing delivery (after all they bottle their own complimentary water - this means they put the tap water in a bottle before they put it on the table; lol)  The decor is unique yet well replicated in pittsburgh, the layout is a more spaced out splice between industry in lawrenceville and a williams and sonoma shelving emsemble.  I did enjoy myself, yet my companions would would like to see actual corn on the cob in the american clam bake rather than just little nibblets.  All in all another typical Ampd group production but good to check out for the new restauraunt scene.",

    "text": "The restaurant itself is beautiful and I loooove the decor. I just wished the food lived up to the space.   We had crispy brussel sprouts and calamari for appetizers. The Brussels were delicious, but the calamari was horribly over cooked.   For the entree I ordered the chicken piccata. Disclaimer: I LOVE chicken piccata and my boyfriend's is hard to beat. What came out confused me. Why is there a cream sauce with capers in it on my chicken?! Why does this chicken look deep fried instead of pan fried?! I held out hope that the flavors would make up for this \"interesting\" take on the dish. No, no, and NO. I only had a few bites. The chicken was so chewy and dry it wasn't really edible.   Our cocktails were decent, but I couldn't get over my $26 entree being that subpar.  I doubt we'll return.",

    "text": "Let me start with: I have worked in a restaurant and have for 15 years.  I get it.  I understand it.  There will be some glitches.  I have given Ten Penny 3 chances.  I went to TP within weeks of its Grand Opening.  The service was great, the food was great.  Overall, a great experience.    Strike 1:  My boyfriend and I went to TP for an early dinner (around 5 pm, empty restaurant) on a Saturday night a few months ago.  The service was horrendous.  Every few minutes, a new employee would come over and ask if we needed any thing.  One would come up and ask for drinks, when we already had them on the table, then some one just took our menus before we ordered.  About 4 or 5 people, including server assistants and random servers came to our table over the course of our meal.  (FYI, food was under average and cold) No steps of service and I had no idea who my server was until the end when a server (not a manager) came up and said \"Sorry, I know that this was a little crazy, we had to let some one go right before this shift\".  I don't know how she thought that would make everything OK.  In the end we paid and tipped appropriately, but left with a  bad taste in our mouths.  Strike 2 and 3:  Last Sunday I went to brunch and was going to give TP another chance.  The reservation was originally made for 7 @ 10 am and then when we needed to add a few more, we were told, \"We could squeeze that in\".  The place was empty.  Our food came out in a timely manner, but one item never came out (but when it did come out, my friend said it was delicious) and I bit into my chicken sausage only to have the wrapper of the sausage in my meal.  Sorry, strike 2 and 3.  I tried.  I really did.  I like the decor, the location, but I just can't give it a perfect 10.",

    "text": "When a restaurant's most interesting offering is a burger, and it's not a a place that specializes in them, a reviewer is tempted to lop off at least one or two stars or avoid them completely, but in this case, doing either would be a grave error. Ten Penny's eponymous burger is worth paying to park in a garage for.   Fortunately for us one lazy, culinarily-challenged weeknight after work, Kay and I happened to be within reasonable walking distance from her employer's complimentary lot. I'd remembered that Ten Penny was a new competitor in the Downtown Pittsburgh dining scene and convinced my significant other to make the trek, but that's not important. Let's discuss the burger.   I didn't want to order one (I go to burgers too often), but the other entrees just weren't quite piquing my interest. Besides, working in a physical job gives a guy a craving for the glorified steaks, and this was not only glorified, it was rarefied, literally and figuratively.   Let's muse about the doneness, something TP's crack cooks NAILED. If you want an ideally pink and juicy slab of sizzling chopped meat, this is where you need to be, and the Ten P Burger needs to be in front of you. The cuts of meat, whatever they may have been (I'm guessing sirloin and chuck at least), that comprised this burger were treated with utmost reverence.   And the fixin's are fierce. A sunny fried egg straddles the patty obscenely like a blond stripper on a muscled athlete. Watercress, a surprise component, adds freshness and crunchy texture. Bacon, an almost unwritten essential topping, brings the fat and the brine. Tomato plays its obligatory role well while a red onion jam upstages all else with its smoky, caramelized, aromatic essence. Wilted cheddar nips the palate playfully as an medley of pickled vegetables snaps the entire thing in the ass. Seldom ever satisfied with a burger sans mayonnaise, I requested to have bacon rosemary aioli, something that came with our appetizer, the Truffled French Fries, slathered onto the top half of that toasted, spongy bun to make it unrepentantly unctuous, and while I use that word sparingly, this burger spared nothing. Nouveau rich, it was Ric Flair strutting into a Las Vegas nightclub treating all patrons to drinks. Imagine excess personified on a plate.   Since we'd ordered the fries to share, I instead chose the Mixed Greens salad as my side dish with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette. Lettuce, pickled radish, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, Kalamata olives, carrots, and tomatoes proved to be orchestral, the crispy pepitas providing the percussion as my taste receptors were cleansed between bites both leafy and beefy  The brittle yet fluffy and therefore deftly prepared fries themselves almost reached the decadent heights of the burger with their truffle oil, shaved parmesan, and roasted garlic plucking wild, ambrosial, exotic, nutty, sweet strings betwixt the teeth and on the tongue, the aforementioned aioli furthering this affair down the primrose path to ruin. A drunken banker would be very pleased with this at midnight and incensed that a pleb like myself would be enjoying it alongside him.    From elsewhere on the rest of TP's relatively stodgy carte, I managed to steal a bite of Kay's Seared Duck Breast which comes with Jasmine rice, gingered carrot puree, baby bok choy, and a saba glaze, the bird itself calling to mind an extremely supple, honey-baked ham if I'm to be believed.   Dessert for the lady was the somewhat mild-mannered Chocolate Pretzel Torte. One taste reminded me of a softened, gently sugary biscotti, the hazelnut mousse that topped it providing a modicum of confectionery heft. While tempting enough, I was looking for a more risque item and found it in the Peanut Butter Cookie.   Other restaurants have similar desserts, Burgatory being one of them (the defunct Gullifty's Killer Kookie For Two is your father...), but TP's blend of white, milk, and bittersweet chips gives it a distinct flavor, especially when baked and served in a cast iron pan to ensure buttery crumbly edges. Salty and saccharine smacked into each other on a platter of golden dough, the fine housemade vanilla ice cream foiling the heat and a somewhat limp hot fudge almost acting as a wallflower.  Ten Penny's interiors resemble a warehouse converted into a cozy, upscale loft. We felt as if we were house-sitting for a young, single advertising executive as we noshed on bar food that had no right to be as regal as it was. Leather seats like those found in a psychiatrist's office can be found in the booths. Shelves with bottles of oils and jars of pasta stand against whitewashed brick walls. A stark, metallic, beaconing \"P\" glows above the front door. You'll feign prestige for 90 minutes.   Upon paying our tab, we headed out and spoke to the tall, strapping host who probably doubles as a bouncer. \"You look like you earned it,\" he told me as he laughed. \"Indeed I did,\" I replied. It had been a rough one after all.",

This was possibly the worst grilled cheese sandwiches of my life. How you ask? Im not sure. Try Texas toast. Put one slice of white and one slice of orange cheese on it. Make sure there is not enough on so that it oozes out and looks all yummy when you try to eat it. Grill the sandwich well before the rest of the meals are ready to be served so what cheese is there has a good long time to solidify before serving. I think those are the tricks. As to service, our waitress was quite pleasant and stopped often. But important note - if you're going to stop four times to ask how everything is - look your customer in the eye and pause so that they can answer before you run off. Otherwise your question was meaningless.  I would not hurry back.",

I would go again if joining a group but wouldn't go out of my way for it.   Ambience: Modern and open. Loved the location and decor. Definitely what I would expect for a downtown restaurant. I would suggest this place for small groups on an evening or at lunch.   Food: I can't really comment on lunch or dinner since we went for a weekend brunch. The food was average- interesting options but under executed. We started with the Margherita Flatbread which was under seasoned and overly greasy. Being adventurous, I tried the Carrot Cake Pancakes. I'll give them an A for effort but D for flavor. The pancakes were thick and moist like I prefer them but the flavor profile was off. The pancakes were surprisingly not very sweet but the carrots were overpowering and rum-pineapple syrup a bizarre addition. A little cinnamon mixed in with the pancake batter and a different syrup altogether might have salvaged the dish.",

Very open, lots of windows, and impressive bar. Lots of wood that screams rustic and comfort. The details to branding are also great. One of my co-workers even leaned over to me and said \"coming to this place made me realize I haven't been anywhere nice in Pittsburgh in a really long time\".   I've read other reviews about the lackluster service. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She came back to check on us in timely intervals. I personally dislike when servers are constantly asking if you need anything. It becomes annoying.   Now about the food. I thought it was decent. I had the crab cake with grits entree. I loved the crab cake which had big lumps of crab and the roasted red pepper sauce layered with a surprising spicy kick. I found the grits to be boring and a bit to chunky for my tastes. My co-worker decided on the chicken curry entree. The server promised that he'd love it. When asked what region the curry was from, she said \"Pittsburgh\". This was an honest answer because we both could barely taste the curry. He did say the black forbidden rice with the broth and bok choy went well together.",

    "text": "Ok, so I'll give you the facts as it happened :)  So I walked in to Ten Penny for lunch after getting out of jury duty (yay!).  I looked for the host and no one was to be found so I settled and made my way to the bar.  As I sat down, I noticed the host at his stand TEXTING!!  Ugh :( I didn't really want to sit at the bar, so I approached him and asked if I could have a table for one.  In the rudest, most condescending tone, he said, \"I'm sorry, but we're booked.\"  Really?!? At 1:30 with the place practically empty?  OK, I went with the flow and sat at the bar.  I ordered a water to start and told the bartender, \"I already know what I'd like, the salad nicoise, please.\"  He said, \"I'm sorry, that is no longer on our menu.\"  I politely said, \"It was on your menu on your website.\"  (Mind you, at this point, I'm about ready to eat my own arm.  I honestly think my stomach was eating itself I was that hungry.)  He said, \"No, we had to 'dumb down' our menu because it was too much for the kitchen to handle.\"  I told him, \"You guys need to update your website then.\"    Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed, not in the fact they didn't have what I wanted to eat, but in the fact of the poor attention to service they exemplified.  Honestly, log into Pinterest and search for their menu items.  You too could make what's on their menu at a fraction of the price (check out DJ's Butcher in Bloomfield for awesome meats).  On the way out, I reminded the host to pay attention at work.  I understand they're \"new\", but basic Service 101 goes a very long way, especially in the restaurant industry and with so many new places opening up.  This all happened on March 18th and as of today, April 14th, the salad Nicoise is still on their online menu.  Too bad-I really wanted to like this place :(",

    "text": "Checked out Ten Penny for the first time this weekend and it was surprisingly a nice atmosphere.  I can't comment on the food, as we only were there for dessert and drinks, but our bar experience was above average.   The bar staff was very friendly and quickly attentive from the time we sat down. I ordered a TP No. 1 Cup which was delicious and my friend ordered a traditional Cosmo martini. We were both happy with our choices.   We then had heard about their S'mores dessert and ordered that. The homemade graham crackers, homemade marshmallows and Hershey's bar was amazing. We roasted the marshmallows (raspberry, vanilla and chocolate/jalapeno) and made our own s'mores. It was worth every bite.   The only thing that was confusing was their valet service. It was snowing pretty bad so we opted for valet. It said \"$10 valet or $7 with validation inside.\" When we cashed out we got $3 off what we thought was the valet. When we got outside we gave the $9 - $7 + a $2 tip. He thens knocks on my window and says \"You owe me $10\". We were both confused because we said we got it validated inside and we thought it was $7. He then explained that valet is always $10, and you just get $3 off your tab inside like a \"coupon\" off your tab. It still didn't make sense to us but we ended up giving him $12 before he allowed us to drive away. Next time - I probably wouldn't valet but I'd go back and try dinner for sure.",

It was fresh and rich and I only wished that it came with a couple pieces of bread to dip with.  I think the cost was a bit much but, I'm only hear for a week and I would go back hand down again.",

    "text": "I was here last week for dinner with some friends. We had a reservation since there were 7 of us. We sat down, waitress was right over to get drink orders & answer menu questions.  The troubles started when we asked for separate checks, they said for 6 or more they didn't separate them, but that we could put 7 credit cards on one bill & split it. Don't get me started on how this is less efficient than separate checks.  My friend ordered the meatball appetizer as part of her main meal. She received her salad first, but we were told it would be about 10 more minutes for the meatball because it was still cooking. When it finally came out it was mushy & what felt raw on the inside, she politely asked to send it back & get something else in its place. Waitress said \"No problem\". A few minutes later the manager came over, to tell us that it wasn't raw, they cook in a pot for 8 hours & that she shouldn't have sent it back. Get your story straight here people, does it cook for 8 hours, or were you cooking it & it needed 10 more minutes. The manager was rude & unprofessional to a situation that was initially handled well.  I received my caesar salad, which to the tune of $9 is no more than 2 hearts of romaine with some caesar dressing drizzled over top. Seems expensive if I have to cut all my own lettuce, but okay.  Finally our bill came. The meatball remained on the bill + the substitute item ordered, my drink was more than the listed menu price & we had a 20% gratuity added (which the menu stated was only for parties of 8 or more - we were a party of 7.) I brought the receipt errors to the attention of the waitress. Who returned & had fixed one problem. I showed her again the wrong drink price + 20% gratuity. She huffed & told me the drink was $8. I said, none of your menus say that, and I showed her. She finally told me she would \"see what she could do\" before returning with a receipt with correct drink price, but still 20% gratuity. I was told that because the initial reservation was for 8 that we were subject to the 20% gratuity. Unfortunately, we were running behind at this point for our other evening plans & my friends told me not to worry about it.  There's a reason this place was not packed on a Saturday night, the food is of average or lesser quality for expensive prices, the service is slow, and the customer is apparently NOT always right.",

Truly memorable. Our waiter, Pickle, was so nice and interesting and knowledgeable. The GM, Lindsey, came by to visit as well then after lunch took us downstairs to the private club speakeasy. The ambiance of the whole restaurant is superb. We're inviting other friends to join us there Saturday night for the speakeasy experience. Private club that's open to the public, so they're open until 3:30am!!! Can't wait!!!",

Worth it.  The food--good. Very good. The Shrimp Trio appetizer was quality, tasty. Had a Mediterranean flatbread, which was overly salty and passable, but not something I'd order again. The tomato bisque, OK. Get something else.  The glazed salmon was excellent. Nice presentation and the accompanying flavors were well balanced.   Overall, the place is priced well and makes the effort to prepare exceptional food, even if they miss here and there. Definitely a place I'd return to if it were convenient.",

    "text": "OVERVIEW:  The service was incredibly slow (3 hours for 3 courses) and poor, the food was overpriced for the quality and it was overly noisy.    DETAILS: Despite a reservation we were seated in the bar area which was so noisy we couldn't hear one another.  It seemed a bit quieter in the dining area.  There is a lively bar scene and the cocktails are good.  Our waiter took forever in bringing each course (an hour between appetizer and entree; 30 min to bring our drinks) and frequently forgot what we had ordered and had to come ask us again.  Our food was ok, but the flavors were generally unoriginal and somewhat bland.",
