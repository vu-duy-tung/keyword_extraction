The service is comically bad. The staff here is incredibly slow. Sometimes they'll see you standing there and not help you for several minutes. I've had to wait in line more than 20 minutes when the line was long.  And don't even think about making a special request (e.g., no mayo). You won't get it.   When the service is this bad, it makes for an entertaining experience. Honestly. And the staff is friendly, even if they couldn't care less about their jobs.",

Come around the bend from ordering at the sign and you may think you are about to be the first victim in a new horror flick.  The bushes are overgrown, weeds popping up around them.  Then you pull around and see you have to go through a dark tunnel.  A dim light flickers overhead, you hear the hum of your car engine and smell the exhaust.  You pull up to the rickety window and as it opens you almost expect an axe wielding murderer to be on the other side.  You silently pay for your food in fear that you may say the wrong thing to bring on the wrath of the employee.  As you quietly pull away, you think you're almost free until you hear the *ding ding* of the bell that reminds you of pulling up to the gas pumps.  As you pull back into the light of daylight you think to yourself, 'I survived!'  Well almost, that is until you discover now you have to dodge pedestrians on the sidewalk and then pray to god that you can get back onto Carson St.  Good luck with that.  I wouldn't step foot in this place.  Yes, it looks all nostalgic from the outside, but once you get inside it just looks rundown.  As far as Burger King goes, take the time to go elsewhere.",

The fries were not ready, so I had to wait about 6 minutes, meanwhile the Whopper Junior was getting cold.     I mentioned to an employee that there was a few slices of cheese on the floor behind the counter, I received no response.  I completed my Whopper Jr. and then went up to the counter to order a 4 piece Chicken Nugget. I paid and told the server that I wanted Sweet and Sour with those, he said \"we don't have sweet and sour\". I then requested Barbeque. He said they had no sauces..only Ketchup.   I asked why he didn't tell me that when I ordered and he said I didn't ask.  I requested a refund and was issued one. I also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there.

The 5th pizza place we wanted to try had become a full-on bar. I had seen another pizza parlor that I hadn't heard or read of before, so we made our way back up Carson to where we parked, in search of a bathroom and one more pizza place afterwards before ending our intensely chilled evening out on the tiles.   When we went back to the bathrooms, we found that both were locked.  Oh, you KNOW how this works: A few heroin junkies spoil it for the straight-edgers like me. Damn it.   We had to buy something before we'd be allowed to use the facilities.   I went through this before at a McDonald's last year on St. Paddy's Day. Hey, I was pressured into downing a yard of green beer.   Well, I orderd a Hi-C, and Kay had a Diet Coke. This was after waiting 20 minutes.   The gruff manager said \"I'll unlock the doors,\" with a smirk on his face. He had us. I smirked back since I knew what the racket was.   I urinated for what was seemingly an eternity, got back to our seat, and sipped on the Hi-C...with a pizza box in front of us. The gaggle of high-school kids across from us thought that was funny.  \"Do they eat Subway sandwiches at Wendys? Huh-huh-huh.\"  I felt like going over to explain our night to them but decided that it would be futile. What teenager even knows what Yelp is?   Alas BK, your burgers are dry, your onion rings bland, and you add/remove too many items from your menu. As Ronnie Dio used to sing...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ3ZfrCPKEqM%26feature%3Drelated&s=4dccd3b718197bac45d8be7876ec3c1bfa7a8ee307b01af0f94f9959fd73631c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Z3Zf...</a>  While we were here, we found someone to give our crappy Pi Coal Fired Pizza to.  P.S. My grandmother used to come to this BK when she was alive and living in South Side 2.5 decades ago. She would only come by to pilfer straws, sugar, plastic utensils, napkins, and coffee creamer. God Bless her. She may have been the subject of a certain Jane's Addiction song.",

    "text": "Has hell frozen over? For the first time in 15 years, I got an awesome burger from the South Side Burger King. The South Side location for years has had the rep of being the Bad News Bears of the Burger King franchise, a blight on this old school flame broiled fast food world. This location has gone thru some dark years; like the time they served your \"to go\" order in questionable unmarked brown paper lunch sacks. (?!?)  Walking back from some Carson Street errands, I saw a snake of cars spilling from the Burger King drive thru, a line? I had to check it out and grabbed a quick sit down lunch. I have periodically eaten here over the years just to see if they've gotten any better and have always been disappointed---which is a shame because I have a childhood soft spot for Burger King--one of the few fast food places in the South Side.   First of all, the place has gotten a makeover and looks pretty hip. They have new modern fixtures and replaced the old saggy booths and drink station. I think you need a computer degree to figure out the new drink kiosk. Each table was festively decorated with a Burger King crown even. Someone got real \"extra\".   There was a bit of a wait, but is was lunch hour so not too bad. The surprise was when I got my meal. The Burger was perfectly assembled, deliciously flame-broiled and hot! Not rushed looking at all. The fries were good too, even though Burger King fries are one of my least favs in the fast food hierarchy. The burger was meticulously wrapped as well, weirdly perfect enough to notice. It looked like some serious quality control went serving my lunch. I felt like I was in an alternate universe. Who is this Burger King? What happened? Is it under new ownership?   I don't even care. I hope it maintains. The last burger I got on Carson St. was at Hello Bistro a block away, and I'm telling you hands down, the burger patty at Burger King was way more satisfying.   So, if you've given up on this Burger King location because they've been so bad for soooo long, I suggest you give this place another chance. I'm going to have to go back to make sure this last visit wasn't a fluke.",

I waited 10 minutes for them to serve the car in front of me and over 10 minutes at the window waiting for my order...! I could see in the window and they weren't busy...  The bag with nuggets & fries was sitting there the whole time but the burgers weren't done.  I heard the guy ask for them 3 times...!  How can they call this fast food?  Got home (5 mins away) and the burgers were still warm but the fries & nuggets were cold.  Im only giving them 2 stars because the guy working the window was very polite.",

I'm giving this chain location five stars because they're always super busy but food is served fast and fresh. People working there are nice and patient. Let's face it, we all want our fast food cravings handled with love and care. Right? This location was filthy and disgusting filled with less than savory characters for decades. Now it's clean and bright and there's no worries about sitting down and enjoying that Whopper goodness. Flame-Broiled, baby!!!",

    "text": "The South Side Burger King--if you're hungry and you're in the South Side, chances are this Burger King is closed.  Decades ago, I'm sure this location flourished. Unfortunately, the outdated branding and incessant loitering has ripped this once King from his throne.  Dissatisfied with a $9 lunch that I bought at a local establishment, I thought I'd spend a few bucks on cheap grub at Burger King to satiate my need for quick, greasy, delicious fast food. The front door was closed, and there was a sign posted--\"Please Use Side Entanc.\" We entered using the side entrance, and were greeted by blacked out LCD screens. Only one of them seemed to be on, and it was adorned with a floating \"SOLD OUT\" screensaver.  The menu was printed and taped to the counter. It was heavily stained with grease and pop. \"Chicken nuggets and french fries,\" I thought to myself. \"Chicken nuggets and french fries,\" I repeated out loud.  Another customer ahead of me inquired about the french fries. \"That's all we have, they're not sending us the other kind anymore,\" the manager said. Steak cut. Obviously frozen. My mother used to get ones just like it at Costco. The chicken nuggets came out. They weren't the usual crowns--oh, no. They were nostalgic of my elementary school lunch chicken nuggets. I asked for barbeque sauce, and the manager rushed around back and grabbed a plastic high-ball glass before filling it up with Sweet Baby Ray's.  The radio blasted 80s dance music before shifting to Simon and Garfunkel. Hello, darkness, my old friend.  The solemn faces, crying children, and disgruntled coworkers around me validated my conclusion--Hell exists, and it is the South Side Burger King.",

Same cold fries, overdone chicken sandwiches, same annoying kids still loitering and hanging inside without buying food.   On a positive note, the workers are nice and they have that futurerama Coke machine ;)  Please do something about the loitering. Alot of business is getting lost because you let 14-17 year olds chill, talk loud and reckles... cursing up a storm. No employee says anything.. Yet they didn't spend $1 to contribute to your sales :/",

Then after finally taking my order I had to wait around half an hour for my food. Their were a couple other people waiting too while the employees gossiped and joked amongst themselves. Eventually I got my chicken nugget combo meal which was very dry. It seemed like the chicken sat out for hours plus they refused to give me my drink because they thought I already got it. Do not go to this place unless you want a terrible fast food experience!",
