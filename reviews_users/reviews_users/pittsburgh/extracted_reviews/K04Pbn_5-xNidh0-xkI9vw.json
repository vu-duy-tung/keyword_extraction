    "text": "In a word: DISGUSTING!!!  In a few more words:  A diet was ruined for an entire week just by glancing in the direction of this restaurant. I hope this place keeps a cardiologist on the payroll!   Each burger and dog is wrapped in tinfoil and are crushed while being shoved into a small paper sack. I watched the customers around me eating out of their grease soaked bags and started to feel a bit nauseous. My onion, relish, and mustard burger was overcooked and rather small in diameter. The only good thing I have to say about the burger was that the relish was very tasty!  The \"kosher\" cheese, bacon, and mustard dog... all I can say is that after one bite I couldn't touch the rest. The bacon was only warm at best as if sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours, and the dog itself was just unappealing.  The fries looked promising but lacked flavor. Did they sprinkle salt on them? I think that was what that glitter is supposed to be. At least vinegar, my favorite condiment, helped me to suffer through this painful meal.   Overall: If you don't mind eating a meal that looks like you had to dig it out of a garbage can then this is your place!",

    "text": "First time to a Five Guys. Mentioned that to the girl behind the counter hoping to get some kind of insight into the whole Five Guys experience but got nothing. (I'm a real customer experience guy)   Didn't know anything about the food but it looked like a cool place to eat. The decor is cool - the whole red and white theme is kind of retro. Ordered a Bacon Burger, Fries, and a drink. Didn't know anything about the menu. Opened the bag and saw nothing but fries - thought that was cool and indeed the fries were excellent! (hence the two stars - they lost 1 star for the customer service and 2 for the burger!)  I pulled out the burger and discovered that the regular burger has 2 patties. I have a pretty hearty appetite and thought okay, this otta be good. Sadly both patties were completely overcooked. As I was sitting there, I saw a sign that said \"We cook our meat juicy and well done\". Well, in my book, juicy and well done is kind of a oxymoron. Juicy to me is a nice strip of pink in the middle of the burger with the juice running down my hand when I take a bite.  Well done is just...well, sucks.  So I thought, let's squeeze the burger and look for the juicyness....nothin'. Kind of skimpy on the ketchup and mayo too.  Choked down the burger, enjoyed the fries and coke.   Not sure I'll be spending $12 bucks for another Five Guys burger and fries anytime soon. (for the money, Red Robin is a much better deal)",

    "text": "I'm a tough critic when it comes to burgers.  I prefer burgers rare to medium-rare, nicely seasoned, dripping juices, and hugged by a bun that's not too bread-y.  The focus should be on the meat, though toppings are an important part of my overall burger experience as well.  I eat fast food very, very rarely.  Though, as mentioned above, I don't prefer beef cooked a whole lot, I can dig a tasty well-done patty.  For me, Five Guys falls into this category.  This Five Guys location in Robinson is the only one I've ever visited anywhere, and it made me and my mom happy after a long day at the hair salon, shopping, and driving.  A summary of my experience: * The staff was delightful. * The music playing--mostly '80s stuff--was fun. * The dining area and restrooms were clean. * The complimentary toppings I chose for my burger--grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, tomato, and mayo--were executed nicely and present in good quantity. * The generic bun, which I don't usually like, worked fine here. * The skin-on fries are greasy, and the way they're thrown into a brown paper bag with a cup isn't cute to me.  I can resist these fries.  I'd stop here for a burger while shopping in Robinson, for sure.",

    "text": "Methinks The Cosmic Trickster is trying to get me to reconsider my dining habits and my obsession with burgers.   It was my turn to pick, and I had no idea where to go eat this afternoon, so since I had been wanting to try FGBF, we came here after a convoluted search.   You get in line, order at one counter, wait for your number, and go to another counter to get your food in a grease-stained bag with a bunch of suburbanites for whom this is a Sunday treat.  Kay was immediately disgusted before we even sat down, and I joined her in disgust after eating my burger.   My bacon cheeseburger was had \"all the way,\" meaning it came with ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, onions, tomato, lettuce, pickle, and grilled mushrooms.   Y'all know how I love a sloppy, obnoxious, sacrilegious, knock-down, drag-out Lights Out match with my meals. I mean, I have partaken in Primanti Brothers, Vincent's Pizza Park, etc. This however just made me close to feeling sick.   Not that it wasn't a decent burger. It was adequately juicy, fat, and easily beats down The Clown's burgers while wearing a straitjacket, but I've honestly had even better burgers at Eat 'N Park or King's, and none of them are as sodden and smashed as these. I don't even understand why they bag everything if you're dining in. It's wasteful and makes no sense.   Ahhh, I see why they give you a bag. The fries spill out of the cup and all over the bottom! Hell, why even put them into a cup at all?   I think the fries was where I hit rock bottom. Laden with oil, half of them had the crispness I look for, others came off as merely blanched, all of them suffered from peanut fat that was in desperate need of being changed. That dark brown color doesn't lie.   I also had a Kosher hot dog and found that it was, well... halfway Kosher. This was certainly a premium frank and not Oscar Meyer, but after wading through the deleterious burger and fries, I just couldn't enjoy it.   There are no desserts (thank God?), but they do have two of those gimmicky, new self-serve soda fountains with 100 flavors.   Five Guys will make you die. It it the equivalent of an edgy artist finally pissing you off for good. It is ugly. It crosses that line. It is too much of a thing that is good to you but not for you.  Nonetheless, this is slightly above average fast food, so 3 stars it gets.   P.S. Yes, I know this isn't health food, and Lord knows I'm not a plant fanatic, but none of my favorite burger joints ever made me feel like Five Guys did, and I arrived with an empty stomach. To the Bestiary this ain't goin'.  P.P.S. Our bill for two burgers, two hot dogs (Kay couldn't bring herself to finish hers), a large order of fries for us to share, and two beverages cost us almost $31!!!! One could get twice as much food at half the price at any Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe, and guess what? It's better! Hell, not even The Redhead has filled me with such self-loathing.",

You can order single or double burgers and the will give you more French Frits thank you can eat. The burgers are cool fresh with real ground beef. The fries are cut from local farms. They also have free topping for your burgers. There is a also have a children's menu for the little ones",

    "text": "It is great to see the Five Guys chain making an inroads into the Pittsburgh Market.  Widely famous and extremely popular this chain is know for its fresh ingredients, use of peanut oil in their fryers, and the posting of the origin of their potatoes being used among other awesome quirks such as free peanuts for their customers.  ((So peanut allergy sufferers beware!))  During this particular visit I had a LBC (Little Bacon Cheeseburger) with tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, mayo, raw onions, grilled mushrooms, and obvious cheese & bacon.  In addition to the LBC which is about the size of a regular patty at any other fast food chain, I had a large order of their Cajun fries and a soft drink.  Total damages after tax, about twelve bucks.  So let's get that out of the way, this place is not cheap, but then again this place isn't a venue you should be eating at on a daily basis anyways...unless you can (1) afford it and (2) don't hold your health in high regard.  Ok, ok, back to the review.  The bun was warmed and slightly toasted, AWESOME.  The burger itself was cooked between medium well and well done ... you had the grilled texture outside but still juicy (juices not bloody) on the inside, and very well seasoned.  The ingredients were top notch, thicker cut bacon played well with the American cheese.  The tomatoes, onions, and lettuce all taste fresh and were the correct temperatures.  The grilled mushrooms were super savory and just enough to taste but not enough to overpower the whole burger.  The fries ... in a word ... glorious.  I'm a sucker for fresh cut fries ... well really anything fried I'm tempted to try.  Their use of peanut oil I'm not sure adds or detracts from the experience (fried is fried to my palate, yes yes I have to make a point to try duck-fat for my next home frying experience).  There was enough Cajun seasoning on them to sizzle the lips & tongue but not enough to wonder if there's potatoes behind all that burning.  They do have that awesome Coke fountain that has the touch screen and the different flavorings, so in one night I tried:  Coke Zero Lime, Coke Zero Vanilla, Sprite Zero Orange, Sprite Zero Cherry, and Peach *gasp* Regular *double gasp* Sprite.  If you haven't guessed it--I'm a big pop drinker.  The overall feel of this particular establishment stuck True to the franchise/chain and to past experiences I've had in other locations.  The service was quick (even when it was super busy) and courteous which is the least I expect if I'm paying twelve bucks for a burger, fries, and drink.  Do keep in mind this is a fast-food establishment.  While the price range is something more like a sit-down place...in the end...you're still at a fast food joint so food-snobs and dieters beware, you might not have a grande ole time.  But if you're ready to let loose and have a \"guilty-pleasure\" type experience, I highly recommend Five Guys Burgers and Fries.",

Food and paper all over I was a little surprised that my burger was almost $9 at a counter service establishment. The burger was  cooked perfectly and was actually pretty tasty for a basic cheeseburger. We split a large order of the fries. The large was not what I expected in size for $6. However, they were fresh and delicious. I wouldn't write this place off but it certainly is not somewhere I am going to be rushing back to.  UPDATE  Gave this place a second try today. Much cleaner this time around!! Food was still good!",

I will probably get littles in the future! I ordered a small fry, but really it was just a small cup piled high with fries and overflowing in their signature brown paper bag. Next time I also want to try the milkshakes!!!",

    "text": "Okay, so now I've been to 5 Guys.  I should be in awe about now, given all the hype about this place, but sadly...not so much.  I got there just as they opened, and the first thing I noticed--being as it hit me like a brick wall--was that it was FREEZING IN THERE!!!  It was only in the mid-70's outside, so that much cold was uncomfortable.  I understand that it probably does get hot in there with the open grills, but there's no need to start out at 40 below.  So, wanting most of the whole experience, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, bacon extra crisp, a small order of fries and a soft drink.  $16 struck me a a lot to pay for lunch, considering it didn't even come with a beer, but not a big deal.  Took an acceptable amount of time to get my food.  Despite the fact that I was eating in, it came in a brown paper bag.  Couldn't help but notice that the bag was being enveloped in grease at a really alarming rate, but again, okay.  As for the food:  The burger meat seems to be of a pretty good quality--the burger was hot, juicy and tasty.  I wasn't at ALL impressed with the bun, which was gummy doughy in my opinion.  The fries were okay, but were SATURATED in grease, to the point where I was only able to eat half a dozen or so.  So.  I didn't hate it, but I don't think it lives up to the rave reviews.  I will say that I never had to chew--my frozen, chattering teeth did the work for me.  In all, there are dozens of better places for a $16 lunch!",

Why? Because my boyfriend and I eat here on a regular basis and we love this place to death.   My boyfriend and I love cheeseburgers and that is no lie. This might be one of our most favorite quickie places to get a good cheeseburger. The place is almost always busy whenever we go there and the food never disappoints. The employees are always friendly and the restaurant itself is usually clean. We don't ask for much and we never leave disappointed.   I always order the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions, grilled jalapenos, grilled mushrooms, pickles, and BBQ sauce. I also always order the cajun fries (get the cajun fries! you won't be disappointed! so yummy!), too. The two are a perfect combo together. My boyfriend gets the Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled jalapenos and BBQ sauce. The difference between the regular Bacon Cheeseburger and the Little Bacon Cheeseburger is the LBC is one burger patty, the BC is two burger patties. So much food, so freaking delicious! As far as the Cajun Fries, usually a regular order is enough for both my boyfriend and myself.   I am going to say that this is the best fast food burger you can get. I also sometimes prefer getting a burger here at Five Guys than at Red Robin. Do yourself a favor, stop at Five Guys and indulge! Enjoy!",
