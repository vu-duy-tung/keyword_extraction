The salad is basically $9 to have someone the EnP salad bar in a bowl and the burger was kind of a bland underwhelming sandwich. I do like the location and I like that i can order a salad and pick it up on the way home when I'm in a pinch for dinner, but I wish the quality of the items for the salads were a little higher. The service here has been excellent each time I've been and their sodas are admittedly really good. I just wish for a standalone EnP concept they'd up the quality a little bit.",

The burgers took forever to be brought to our table. I started to eat my salad as I didn't want it to get soggy. I was almost done with my salad when they got their food. The point of dinner was to eat together and have fun but they had to watch me eat the whole time. Pick it up hello bistro!",

There are way more toppings to pick from, everything is super fresh, and there is a great dressing selection.  They have pre selected salads you can order but you're better off making your own.  I highly recommend the chicken with the fiesta seasoning.",

I usually come once a week for lunch to pick up Cobb salads ( without the blue cheese, tomato, and diced egg, due to dislike and being allergic to some of those ingredients) for both my sister and I. We usually have no problems at all, it's quick and easy with friendly staff..  this time was different and really got everyone's attention in the whole restaurant who were about to order and were already eating... when I ordered the two Cobb salads without the blue cheese, tomatoes and eggs, the staff member Crystal instantly shot me down and said I can not order that because I'm removing three ingredient and that \"I'm better off making my own salad\" in a very rude and snarky attitude. I told her I come here every week ordering the same thing and they make it with no problems .. she continued to raise her voice to me in a yelling manner (now everyone is staring at her in the whole restaurant) saying I \"don't understand\" and that I can only substitute or remove only one ingredient from the specialty salads .. I understand that if it a policy but it has never address to me in all of the 10 plus times I have ordered at this restaurant.. nor is it posted anywhere in the restaurant or on the menu that I ordered from today.. even other employees who were working at the time apologized for her outrages unprofessional behavior and tone while talking to a customer... I am so upset that a business I love to eat at often hires such an unprofessional rude staff member",

From there on out the girl gave me attitude and barely spoke when i was asking questions about the chicken. She asked if my order was to go and i told her yes and she put a lid on the bowl and slammed it on to the counter and walked over to her co workers and was angry and seemed annoyed and i told her to have a nice night but was ignored. I don't understand what the issue was but a major thumbs down on this hello trip. :/",

You can get it with a meat option, or without (I did chicken)and there has to be about 50 different choices of veggies and other toppings.  Even the lettuce options were plentiful and fresh.  I want to say there were 10-15 dressings to choose from as well.  Also, they chop it all for you and ask how you want it chopped.  Very clean, lots of seating inside and fresh food :)",

There was also barely any of the other items I ordered in it.. one carrot, little to no quinoa, etc. what really turned me off is there was a few random pieces of ham and chicken, none of which I ordered. I pretty much stopped eating after that. I think I'll go to Whole Foods next door the next time I'm crazy a good salad.",

I understand that they are trying to open new outlets and different concepts, but it if you never change the ingredients why bother.  My wife and I stopped on our way to Target to pick up a few things.  She ordered the Caprese grilled cheese sandwich and fries.  After reviewing the menu and seeing all the speciality burgers I began to think that their burger must be something special. I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup, I love soup.  My burger came without any condiments, I had to go up to the counter to ask for mayo, and the burger tasted slightly better than the frozen ones you get from Costco.  Oh, and soup is the same chicken noodle you get at Eat n Park, which is not bad, but like I stated before if I wanted to eat at Eat n Park it's a five-minute drive down the street.     Do not be tricked, if you want  Eat n Park level food, go to an Eat n Park.",

Never could get an answer, I'm assuming the containers represent that you can get soup to go.  The menu says they have \"EnP soup\"- maybe they get a couple from Eat n Park and bring them over.  Panera soup way better than Eat n Park and the same price as Hello Bistro.  Husband got a sandwich that was soggy but fries were good.

I noticed the strawberry salad bears a strong resemblance to the same one currently at Eat n Park. I was told of some subtle differences that this salad has and the regular Eat n Park doesn't.  They have a variety of different hamburgers including the famous superburger that the Eat n Park chain has. There is a limited selection of cheese for sandwiches. My husband decided to order the superburger with fries. He was given a number so that it could be brought out to him. I decided to try the build your own salad. You pay upfront for this first before they pull the items to build your salad. Certain items are extra such as chicken, shrimp, and avocado. You start by picking the base greens and then you get an unlimited choice of various toppings. You tell them what you want and they will pull your selections into your prep bowl. They did have items such as quinoa as a topping which I thought was different. I like quinoa but it gets mixed in the salad along with everything else.  Then they will mix it up and serve it to you in a huge plastic bowl similar to what you would get at Brugger's bagels.  I chose as my base kale and spinach and had them add a fair amount of my favorite vegetables, The chicken was prepared different ways so you could choose the time you wanted. I went with that. I saw that they had green ice tea available in addition to peach ice tea. If you want a lemon however, then you must ask for it while you are waiting for your salad to be prepared. They also will ask you how much or how little dressing of your choice you want before mixing it all together.  I finally got my finished salad and went back to join my husband. He told me his superburger tasted a bit greasy. The fries come bagged even though we had decided to eat in. I tasted a couple and again nothing particularly outstanding about it. My salad was fair as well. My kale was crunchy and there was a lot of it!  The manager Andy came over to chat with us and I got the opportunity to learn how their concept works. They do offer some farm to table items and compared to Eat n Park's famous salad bar, they offer more here. On the contrary however, when you go to Eat n Park and order the salad bar, if you don't like what is on it then you can get a fresh plate and start again. He also explained that the fries always come bagged since their concept is fast casual.  I did ask about some of the pastries I found on the bar since all they were selling here were mini smiley cookies. He explained to me that since they don't have a bakery they can't carry the same mini bear claws or muffins I normally find over there. They will be carrying soups like tomato and chicken noodle in the fall. Don't look for chili. It is not a popular item here.  I did get the opportunity afterwards to talk a little with the chef and learn how some of the food is prepared. The place was fairly packed by the time we left. Outdoor seating is available. They are just a little more expensive than Eat n Park. They will be opening up another Hello Bistro on Washington Road in Mt. Lebanon in the near future.  The eatery is located right in the center of the upper part of the new strip mall off of Siena Dr and right around the corner from the Porch at Siena. It is a different concept having them prepare it for me. Nevertheless, I probably will return to the regular Eat n Park for their soup and salad bar where I can make it up any way I choose for a bit less money.",

Fresh food at great prices, in a laid back fun setting. The sandwiches and burgers are great! Made fresh to order. The hand cut fries are incredible and for 2$ you get a sack of them!! The salad set up is amazing! Made to order then you pick the fix-ins and they mix it, chop it, and serve it up! Great drinks in the fountain by Bolen and the milkshakes are amazing also. They setting is fun a open with tables and high seating. Plus an outdoor section, which pittsburgh restaurants need to get on Board with more! People like to sit outside to eat. Period!  The prices can't be beat either, for lunch for two with drinks to be under 20$, you have to love that!",

So there we stood watching them slop together phone orders while ignoring our orders. The floor and countertops were disgusting with food all over them. They were hurrying to make the orders so quickly that they were slopping individual ingredients from one bin to another.  Using the same salad bowl to mix salad after salad after salad, hope you weren't allergic to something. No sense customizing your order. We asked for the manager to get a refund and here she refunded our money and never even asked why. You better order over the phone, because if you saw how dirty it is in person, you'd never be able to eat here again.",

You can customize your entire salad from type of lettuce to protein and tons of topping options. They chopped it in front of you and then enjoy! Large portion size which is always too much for me to finish! If you don't like to customize your own, they have salads on the menu to choose from as well. I usually get salad but I've had the veggie burger as well. I would skip this next time though as it didn't hold any shape and was just mushy.   Service is always pretty quick and prices inexpensive. I've seen it get a little backed up when it gets busy around lunch however, and I've seen about a 10 minute wait at the salad chopping station. Indoor and limited outdoor seating. I'll certainly eat here again when I want a good salad.",

    "text": "Hello Bistro was one of my favorite places to go for dinner in Oakland as a student at Pitt, so excited to visit a new location in the South Hills on a recent visit back! I had a free entree coupon for my birthday (pro tip: sign up for their email listings to get said free entree!), so visited the Upper St. Clair restaurant with my mom. This location was much larger than the Oakland and South Side ones, with a nice outdoor patio and extensive indoor seating as well. The set up at the counter is essentially the same, including the signature salad bar, which did not have any of the options compromised at the \"satellite\" location. Always feel so welcoming when walking in the door!  I always opt for a build-your-own salad, and this time was no different - I got the spinach and kale lettuce base and added on tofu as some protein. Since it was summertime, strawberries and green apples were on the bar, so had to get those. I also included some other basic salad toppings (cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.), but always need to get the roasted beets - these are the finest option on the bar, in my opinion!! I even requested to have double the portion thrown on, they are that good. I topped the salad off with some goat cheese (not often a cheese option!) and a few almonds to bring the whole salad come together. I love that the employees chop the salad for you and mix the dressing in - I always go for small bites and light dressing (pro tip: ask for dressing on the side if you are worried it will be under-dressed), and this time I tried out the poppyseed vinaigrette to round out my summer-themed salad. My salad was dressed, chopped, and topped perfectly, and the flavors I selected made it feel so summery and refreshing, yet so filling and satisfying.   Hello Bistro is likely my favorite fast-casual restaurant in PGH, and I am happy the 'burb locations do not disappoint. Happy to have had another solid experience at Hello, and looking forward to many more trips back when I visit PGH again! (PS please open a location in Columbus!!)",

We flagged down one of the teens working there and asked him if he thought our burgers were cooked properly, and he said no, and offered to have new ones made for us.

The French fries are really good and very different from Eat'n Park's.  They are skinnier and have a really good seasoning on them.  Another plus of this place was the self dispensing Eat'n Park ranch dressing.  Can't beat that.  I would like to go back to try the salads which looked really good.

The restaurant was empty (not another patron in the place) and six people working. We stood and waited to order for at least 3-5 minutes which was confusing (because NO ONE else was there) - a girl asked if we were ready, we said yes, and she walked away to fill herself a drink at the soda station and didn't come back over to help us but talk to another employee about something on her phone instead! Finally - someone came out of the back to help and take our order. A couple employees were bickering right in front of us and appeared visibly tense. After both of our salads were made - we asked for them to-go and the guy chopping didn't want to mess with it so he tossed two lids at my boyfriend who clearly had a full cast on his broken hand and could use help. We again had to ask for a bag and further had to ask for the utensils to be refilled because there were no forks !  As we were walking out, both my boyfriend and I could overhear them making comments.   Management - you need an ADULT in here ! 5 of the 6 were kids - under 21- and the only adult was a cook in the back. They were rude, unprofessional, and less than helpful !!!!!! I frequent many businesses in the Siena plaza and this one is not up to par at all. Very Disappointed !",

    "text": "Finally got to try Hello Bistro for lunch! Upon walking in you place your order at the counter and then they give you a number and serve you your food. They have a ton of different salad options, including making your own. I saw probably 50 different toppings you could get on your salad.   They have different featured items and I went with the turkey burger that came with pineapple, arugula, and a chipotle mayo. Unfortunately, they were out of the chipotle mayo which was a bummer. If this is a special featured item you are pushing- I'd like to see them have all of the ingredients. However it was still super tasty and fresh so I was too upset. It was cooked perfectly and had a really good flavor! Sometimes turkey burgers can taste strange but this was the perfect texture and size. My husband had French fries with his burger and they were fresh cut and seasoned perfectly! Did I mention they serve Eat N Park ranch dressing, which is the best!   The best part was our entire lunch was only $15 and we left stuffed! Such a good deal. I will be back soon to try the featured strawberry chicken salad before it disappears after summer!",

Anyway, this is a clean, modern diner where you can build your own expensive salad from a million ingredients or get burgers, grilled cheese or soup.  I got the onion mushroom burger with fries. The burger was ok and my fries were over cooked and over salted and burnt. It was just ok.  If you want to sit in a clean diner in a nice European styled plaza with rich white people listening to retro and Christian rock hits while eating salad then this is your place.",

I love that they make the salads (regular salad bars kind of gross me out) and love that it is unlimited toppings.   I made my own salad, everything was fresh and I loved that I got to customize it exactly as I wanted.   My bf built a burger and enjoyed it as well.   We both got an order of fries and they were absolutely delicious. I love fresh cut fries and they were def real fresh cut fries. My favorite part is the big pump of ranch next to the ketchup.   The service was friendly and quick. The restaurant was clean and inviting. The meal was reasonably priced.    We will def be back.",

    "text": "I came here today for the Tandoori chicken salad. The other ingredients sounded good and are generally what I like. The neat thing they do is chop the greens into small pieces. That made it easy to eat AND it makes it possible for them to pack a lot of greens into the bowl. It took awhile to eat but wasn't a workout on the jaw since it was chopped. The other ingredients like the beets and avocado were great. There wasn't a lot of chicken but it seemed appropriate for lunch.  I enjoyed this selection a lot and will have it again.  The salad offerings are what make this place stand out to me. Whenever I want a salad for my meal, I will come here.",

Last nite was the first time I placed an online order and man, I'll tell ya, that is the way to go! Easy peasy! I highly recommend it if you don't don't want to wait since when I've went and ordered at the register, it seemed to take a significant time for \"faster burgers and salads.\"  Last night I ordered the Southern Shrimp salad and it was very good. It was so filling I could only eat half. Today is another day! I also ordered a turkey cheeseburger and it was pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I did try their GF bun last time and it was kind of blah. Otherwise, the salads I've ordered on the menu or customized in the past have been good. The staff members are always friendly, and the place is clean and always lively.",
