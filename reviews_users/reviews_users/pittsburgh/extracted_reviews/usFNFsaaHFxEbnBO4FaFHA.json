    "text": "Meal = AMAZING. Service = GREAT. Host Staff = Snobby. Table location = THE WORST. Thus sums up our visit to Piccolo Forno. The food was sooooooo good, and honestly, I'm no fan of Italian. However, from the Butternut Squash Bruschette, to my main entree of Salmon Ravioli, topped with a \"Dream Bomba\" dessert (peanut butter gelato in a chocolate shell), everything on the table was perfection. Our service was attentive and informative and joy was had all around. The only slight annoyance of the evening is that the host staff was on the b*tchy side and the table where we dined should not be a table at all. Pressed between the back wall and a coat rack, it was really uncomfortable, and I didn't appreciate the host asking my mother in law to scoot in further so people could pass by to the restroom when there was literally no room for her to move. Tables and attitudes aside, it was a wonderful evening! You still got it, Piccolo.",

    "text": "The food at Piccolo Forno is fine, but not spectacular by any stretch. We tried the quattro formaggi and the mortadella e pistachio pizzas, both of which were good but slightly greasy. The biggest problem with the pizza is that is wasn't hot. Oily pizza does not taste right when it is cold. Clearly, the kitchen had management issues. Beyond the pizzas coming out as cold, it took 10 minutes for 3 more of the dishes at the table to come out after the pizzas, and then another 10 minutes for the last dish to come out.   Out of the dishes, I'll note that the tagliatelle con ragu di agnello had such an odd flavor combination that it could not be finished, and the gnocchetti di crescione was bland. Otherwise, we tried a couple of the desserts. Interestingly, the chef adds lemon flavor to the tiramisu. It must turn people off so frequently that the waiter gave us a heads up; why would the chef keep an unusual dish that the waiters need to warn you about it?   Lastly, I'll comment that our waiter, who started off attentive and helpful, was dismissive and bordering on rude by the end of the evening. It was the sort of 180 turn that makes you wonder: Did the chef just chew him out behind the scenes? Did his girlfriend just text him to break up? It was unusual, and there certainly wasn't anything that we could see that accounted for the change.",

    "text": "Piccolo Forno has been on a long list of restaurants-to-try for a couple years, and I finally came here on Saturday evening with a group of girls. The restaurant did not disappoint!  Our group of 5 arrived at 5pm, but the restaurant already had a 75-90 minute wait. We were told that a table of 4 would only be 40 minutes... However, we had 5 of us, and there was nothing that we could do to change that! Instead, we decided to spend our long wait at the nearby Arsenal (which I highly recommend doing).  I guess there is only one table for 5 at the restaurant... I'm not sure... but when we went back at 6:30, we were told that the table had been occupied for 3 hours. To avoid waiting even longer, we just squished at a little table for 4.   The waitress quickly brought a small basket of bread and butter. It was absolutely delicious! I don't know where their butter is from, but just know that it tasted heavenly. Plus, I loved that the restaurant is BYOB. Some of the girls brought bottles of wine, which were immediately popped open. We were charged only one cork fee of $5 - what a deal!  We shared two appetizers. I am completely blanking on what one of them was... eggplant maybe?... but the second was, I believe, the Affettati, which was a small plate of meats and cheeses. Though the Affettati was tasty, I don't necessarily think that it was worth its $10 price point.  I was torn between the pizza and the pasta, but when I saw some tasty-looking ravioli options, I just had to go with pasta! I settled on the Ravioli con Burro e Salvia (spinach-filled ravioli drizzled with sage butter). It was absolutely incredible. I just recently dined at a highly rated Italian restaurant in the Theater District in New York City, and this pasta absolutely destroyed the three pastas that I tried there.  I can't wait to come back and try some more food. I have a feeling that after trying some more food - and a little less frustration over wait time - I'll be moving this 4 1/2 star review up to 5 stars.",

Couldn't get a last minute reso anywhere else so decided to hang out for the hour which was more like an hour and 20 mins.   The kids' pizza was decent (pretty hard to screw up cheese pizza) but our meals were mediocre if not bad.  Perhaps it was because they were so busy and couldn't hold it together??  The meatball appetizer was gross - breaded, cold, bland meatballs; very mediocre polenta crostini; rabbit pappardelle which had a bland, weird sauce with bits of bone in it, plus it looked rather sloppy in the bowl; and mushroom tagliatelle that would have been much better if it had been hot and the pasta had been cooked al dente.  Won't be back.  There are better pizza places and for pasta I'd stick with Lydia's.",

    "text": "Dishonest hostess; terrible attitude.  Rule #1: customer is always right.  Something is off here. They create seating availability and duration out of thin air and won't take reservations for parties less than 5 or more we came to find out. Having disgruntled customers due to dishonesty isn't worth squeezing few more servings out per night. Very greedy and short sighted.  Wife was hungry and craving Italian. Doing the sensible thing on a Friday night, we called to see if they could seat two. The host says no problem, we can. Great, we walk there. We walk there and ask for indoor seating and are told 15-20 minute wait. Hmm bit disgruntled, but you said 10 minutes ago you could seat us. Oh these things happen, it's tough to tell when there will be seating. Lie #1.  No waiting area, we stand out on the stoop for 20 minutes. No call, nothing. I go in to make sure they haven't forgotten about us. Hostess says we got tables outside, give us some more time to clean it up. Thought we told you we would like indoor seating. Oh, the tables inside are chatty and difficult to tell when they'll leave. Lie #2.   Frustrated, I confront her about lying twice and that had she been honest my pregnant wife would be eating now instead of waiting on the stoop. Again, I get the same snarky attitude and run around. Having lived all over, you'd swear this is the only restaurant and only incompetent hostess in the country incapable of managing customers for a dinner.   Now desperate to eat a piece of bread or anything my wife agrees to outdoor seating. A kind waitress comes out and asks us how we are doing. Frustrated and on edge, hopefully the food will make us forget this. Instead of easing the tension, she decides to regurgitate the same defense as the hostess.   We order and wife eats a bread slice or two. Wife too hormonal and in tears, I throw a few bucks for the bread, and we go elsewhere. Fortunately, we were able to go elsewhere nearby and salvage the night.  The competency of the hostess should be reconsidered.",

I also like to try many of the pasta main courses and I've never had one I didn't like. The only downfall for the food is their processed meats are cured with sodium nitrate. Most processed meat is, but there are many better alternatives that a good restaurant can explore. Hopefully they can explore this option in the future. Even Trader Joes has a Prosciutto not cured with sodium nitrate. So it's possible.   The wait staff is really nice. The down fall is you can't make reservations for small groups. We usually have a 1 hour wait time for 2 people. There are a few bars near by to pass the time so I'll let this slide.",

    "text": "Piccolo Forno has to be, hands down, one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants.    Before I get into the love-fest, I have to say the initial thing that annoys me: you can't make a reservation unless your party is of 5/6 or more, and you can't get a reservation for over 10.  That said, it's a small place and you can generally get a drink across the street at Round Corner Cantina or Franktuary (I'd go with the former).  But, onto PF.  It's byob. This is key.  The salads are very good and well-rounded.  I highly recommend the seafood salad or the insalata miste.  The appetizers are also very nicely done.  There are two types of bruschetta, one a tomato-based and one an olive tapenade.  I'm particular to the olive.  They usually have a decent meat and cheese plate as well, with excellent cured meats.    It's been a long time since I've had pasta there, because the wood-fire cooked pizzas are too difficult to pass up!  My favorite is the Pizze Cappriciosa, which has prosciutto, artichokes, olives, etc., and topped with fried egg.  The fried egg really makes the dish, which is an excellent blend of salty and savory, which balance out the natural acidity of the tomato sauce.  I'd even say the darned thing reheats really well, too!  Other great pizzas include the Funghi, Quattro Formaggi, and the Quattro Stagioni (four seasons), a past favorite of mine.  I've frequently had very good service here as well.  I would highly recommend this place to any Italian food lover!  I easily think it's one of the best \"Italian\" places in town.",

Also, Piccolo is has an accommodating BYOB policy and will keep your wine in a stool while you wait.  Food wise, we started with liver patee. It was served with peas and pickled red onions. I think the items complimented each other well. (This appetizer was reminiscent of ones I am accustomed to having during Russian dinners). For the main course, we split a brick oven pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh, the cheese was pure, and the prosciutto was served cold (as it should be). My only complaint was that the pizza wasn't as crispy or charcoaled as I like.  Lastly, the restaurant was dimly lit giving it an intimate ambiance. I liked how the kitchen was open and you could see the chefs cooking the food.",

I tried their soup of the day which was like an Italian chicken noddle soup--ravioli instead of noodles and dark meat chicken in a broth with carrots and other veggies.  the ravioli was a little bland and the chicken was overcooked.  I also got the pear salad, which was delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and the pears were slightly cooked so they were soft and sweet as opposed to crunchy. my coworker got a pizza, which was generous in size.  It was some sort of veggie pizza.  I thought it was interesting that different parts of the pizza had different types of vegetables sliced on the large side (instead of lots of veggies finely chopped and spread out on the top of the pizza).  It made the presentation look awesome, but I'm not sure if I would have liked that taste wise.   Service was good but we also came when it wasn't too crowded so that was nice.",

    "text": "Wow, I can't believe I am lucky enough to review this wonderful little restaurant first on Yelp!  I have known about this restaurant for many months, but just have never made it in...  until tonight!    Luckily, my friend and I decided to come here.  It was a Friday night and at 6:45 pm, there was already a line and a 30 min to 1 hour wait.  We headed over to the bar which was catty-corner and waited for them to ring and let us know our table was ready.  We were happy that the wait was closer to 30 min and soon, we were happily trying to decide what to order.  I should take this moment to mention that they are BYOB (I love BYOB).  $4 corkage per bottle for wine and $2 per beer.  We finally decided on the Bruschetta (5 large pieces of mixed standard, olive tapenade and roasted red peppers) to start with, a good choice although I heard the Melanzane is wonderful.  We both got the lasagna, which everyone raves about (deservedly so, as the pasta sheets are obviously freshly made and is just as good eaten cold as it was hot).  Happily, a salad came with the entree - yay!    I sadly did not try their dessert as I was to stuffed from the amount of food we had eaten.  All that above for approx $20 per person (tax and tip included) plus leftovers!  What a great deal!    BTW, the pizzas looked (and smelled) sooo delicious and were made right on the floor.  This is what I am trying next time.  If you are in the mood for Italian food and want delicious food coupled with great service, great prices, and a good ambiance, you definitely need to make it to this restaurant.  I am almost scared that my review will make it even harder for me to get a table next time! -------------------------------------------------- I've had the pizzas and dessert.  The pizzas are quite good (Il Pizzaiolo is still supreme though) but forget the desserts.  After 2 tries, I am totally happy to fill up on my entree and forgo the dessert.  Reservations for 5+ people!",

I hesitate to review this place because too many other people already know how good it is and now it's not unusual that one must wait for a table. But PF is good enough to wait for as long as it takes!   Service is above average by friendly and knowledgeable staff. Parking can be tough, but they have a small lot on the Strip side.  Their pizza is excellent.......bruschetta is great.....Lasagna very tasty....good salads! BYOB your best bottle for this very special place.",

The pizza crust  is delightfully crispy and thin, but the sauce is a bit too sweet for my liking.  I would still go back and order again.   Most of the specialty pizzas feature prosciutto, which one of my personal favs but my dining companion does not indulge in swine.    Next time I'm gonna try one of the pastas.  That's right, you can look forward to seeing this face again, Piccolo Forno.  Be warned and ready.",

My husband and I have frequented PF many times, and have introduced many of our friends to this fabulous restaurant as well.  Every time that we have visited PF, be it for lunch or for dinner, we have had nothing short of outstanding service from the hostess to the servers.  The restaurant owner has even been on site several times, and is always very friendly.  Their appetizers and salads are big enough to share with another person.  Their wood fired pizzas are delicious.  If you're looking for just a pepperoni pizza though, these pizzas might not be for you.  My favorite is the Speck & Marscarpone.  Their pastas are delicious as well and are homemade.  Piccolo Forno is a great BYOB place that everyone in the city of Pittsburgh should check out at least once!",

The (beautiful) brick walls definitely work as amplifiers, which turns an otherwise sweet, stylish interior ambiance into a bit of a sound box. And I'd have to agree with other reviewers who have noted the aloof, minimal attention given from servers. Ours put our check on the table in passing without even looking at us.  The menu, however, is delicious, and offers rich pastas (we had the rabbit pappardelle and vegetable cannelloni)  and what looked like inventive, tasty pizzas. On my next visit, I'll for sure give one of those a try. BYO as well with a $5 corkage fee--still far cheaper than paying in-house prices for booze.",

    "text": "MMM...This was a great experience for my friends and I. Everything was spot on, the entire experience. On a side note if you do make a reservation, which we did, They are very forward about letting you know that they will not seat you until your entire party has arrived, and there is a time you are expected to be completed with your meal. I can appreciate the fact that this is the way they run their establishment. When our entire party of 8 arrived we were seated promptly.   Shortly the server arrived and greeted us and offered to open our bottles of wine. As well as informing us of all the specials for dinner. I ordered an appetizer of Torre di mellanzan, which is a small but delicious eggplant appetizer and the night special butternut squash and apple risotto. The risotto was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful.   One thing I would really like to emphasis was how awesome the waiter and service overall, we had was. I have had some really weird experiences with service lately. The waiter was friendly and everything came out together piping hot and for there being 8 people in our party I see that as a heck of an accomplishment. The dining room did not have an empty table and this dude knew how to make the guests happy. Since our party was large they automatically added an %18 gratuity. I still added an addition $5 on to that because I thought the service was exceptional.  BYOB is also awesome with only a $5 fee per bottle. This place was also very appropriately priced I was shocked that the bill with the included gratuity averaged around $52 per couple.  Definitely check it out.",

    "text": "Fantastic restaurant, terrible dining experience. I went to give a try after reading so many positive reviews. When I got in the lady at the reception sat me down really quickly (it was 4 pm so quite open). Then the waiter came and told me they are on a time constraint, okay, I'm fine with that too. To help quicken the process I ordered the soup straight away. Then this was where it went wrong: he rushed back and ask me what to order, after 2 minutes I sat down! I used another minute and ordered an appetizer and main course. Surprisingly,The main course came first! The food turned out to be fantastic so I let that go. Then the appetizer came, also pretty good. I went by myself so I got a small table, and having both appetizer and main dish on the same time barely left space for anything else. Then while I was working on my food, the waiter came to ask if I want anything else. I ordered a cappuccino, and specified \"after when I'm done\". And it came in 1 minute. Good job in getting things down, at the wrong time! Now with three items on the table and a plate and basket of bread (which, btw, is stone cold), the table got too bloody busy. Maybe he didn't hear me asking to serve the cappuccino at the end, but he would if he wasn't rushing! Any waiter who is not trying to push customer out of door should know to serve it last!  In a restaurant like this I expect to enjoy my food, and I can totally see how I should be able to do so under so much stupid pressure.  Oh by the way, I asked before I left, they didn't have a clear reason to be rushing. And it looked like I was the only one that was treated that way.",

Let's start with the service - hostesses were friendly and attentive. We had about a 20 minute wait and they advised us that Piccolo Forno also owned the bar Grapperia, which was about 30 steps away. We decided to walk over and grab a drink, but before we were able to place our order, the hostess called and said our table was ready (winner!).   Once seated, our server Charlie was AMAZING. Very friendly and passionate about the menu. Gave us some great recommendations and was extremely aware and cautious of my daughter's nut allergy when he was walking us through the menu.   I ordered the Spinach Ravioli with Sage Butter (so good), and we had the Crostini di Polenta, Quattro Formaggi pizza & Tagliatelle con Ragu di Agnello for the table. Everything was prepared perfectly and deliciously.   A lot of new places in Pittsburgh are taking a more daring approach with wild and exotic menu items, but Piccolo Forno uses quality ingredients to prepare simple and delicious homemade foods and you can't go wrong with that.   Pro tips: Don't forget your wine or prosecco! Since they are BYOB.",

We opted for the margarita pizza and the pappardelle with roasted rabbit.  The pizza is a delicious thin crust, with plenty of cheese and basil...the better half loved all the basil on it, though I found it to be too much...she wins.

Pasta was good a tad al-dente, which is perfect for me.  The staff was friendly, providing us plenty of insight into the menu, including some of her favorites.  A really nice stop on Butler street.

    "text": "We had a nice lunch at Piccolo Forno on Saturday around 3:00 pm, which is a good time to go since the eatery is on the small side and fills quickly near dinnertime. After reading all the rave reviews about PF, I had it built up to gigantic proportions in my head and of course was a bit let down but mostly due to my own food choices. You see, I'm too Americanized in terms of my Italian food experiences, and Piccolo Forno is much closer to authentic Italian than I'm used to.  We were seated and ordered our drinks. They serve Coca-Cola products and I ordered iced tea, but it tasted like the tea container hadn't been cleaned well enough so the tea tasted a bit off...so I asked for water. Could just be a  fluke. We next ordered an appetizer and salad to share. We ordered POLPETE TOSCANE: baked meatballs of beef and pork with a fresh herb green sauce. These were unusual in that they were rolled in something like an herb. They are not like traditional meatballs. They were interesting to try, but we would not select them again. We next shared INSALATA MISTA: mixed greens with sliced radish, carrot, tomato, and cucumber, tossed in a balsamic vin, topped with shaved Parmigiano. This was good, but I felt the balsamic was too sweet. My husband really enjoyed the flavor.  For the main course my husband ordered SALSICCIA E CIPOLLE pizza: Crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, sausage, onions and roasted fennel. The crust was super thin and crispy - really a treat. While he looks forward to trying the other pizzas, he said he would definitely order this one again and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the TAGLIATELLE CON SUGO DI FUNGHI: porcini and wild mushroom ragu on tomato tagliatelle with shaved truffled pecorino. This was not to my liking, but was a very high quality meal with handmade pasta. Could not ask for more, just wasn't the best dish for me, as it turns out. I think next time I'm going to stick with a delicious pizza cooked in their authentic Italian wood fired pizza oven.  For dessert my husband ordered the Bomba and I had the Limoncello Tartuffo. My husband enjoyed the light Bomba with caramel center, while I felt the limoncello gelato was too tart for my taste. Next time I'm looking forward to getting the Tiramisu.  The service was timely and pleasant and the restaurant had a fresh comfortable atmosphere. There are no steps to get into the restaurant but there are two steps to get to the farthest tables in the back or to visit the restrooms. There is a small iron handrail on the left side of these steps. There is on the street parking, but also a small lot across the side street that is shared with another business. If you go during the day, you very well could find parking in this lot for free!  This is a lovely authentic Italian restaurant with homemade pasta and delicious pizzas. When I find the best dishes to order for my taste buds, it will be a grand slam eatery for me, I'm certain.",

    "text": "I was recommended by a friend to try out Piccolo Forno. Although she gave very nice reviews about the place, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Their pizza, on-point. We ordered the four cheese pizza and I enjoyed every single moment of it. Their pasta and lasagna? Not so much. I could taste the tomato paste very strongly and it was a bit liquidy too. I really like Italian food and I love every pasta, but this one did not cut it for me.  What got me angry at Piccolo was the customer service. I felt mistreated and some what looked down upon. Our waitress was very straightforward and even a little rude. You would think that at a nice place like Piccolo, they would train their waitresses better.   I don't know if I'll be going back any time soon, but maybe I will once I start craving good pizza.",

This is a place where you would take a date but if you want real Italian food, you should go elsewhere.  Also, this restaurant isn't located in a upscale neighborhood but charges like it was.   I paid $19 for my dish and it was full of pasta with very little protein.  Who wants to eat a full plate of pasta?  My daughter ordered a pasta dish with rabbit.  There were only like 3 piece of rabbit meat and they charged $17 for it.  And the dish had no flavor.  I definitely will not return and I'll be searching for a restaurant that makes real Italian food.",

    "text": "Yet another restaurant on my want-to-visit-before-I-leave-PGH list, I was able to check off Piccolo Forno the Sat. before last.  I was on a bike ride with a friend and we planned to stop by, and we managed to time our arrival at 5pm--my preferred time to avoid the Sat. crowds.  At the time of our arrival, we were seated immediately with no wait and were able to enjoy a leisurely early dinner as the crowd begun to surge in half an hour later.  We started off by splitting an order of bruschetta ($7), which intrigued us with its interesting ingredients (mint chevre, basil pesto, etc.).  Both of us especially enjoyed the one with the snow pea relish, which was pickled and made a nice complement to the chevre.  The pesto one was alright, but nothing too out of the ordinary, and we both actively disliked the one with the red pepper tapenade (this shouldn't surprise me given that I'm not a huge fan of either red pepper *or* tapenades).  Props to the owners for creating such interesting and varied bruschetta rather than just serving up the same old tomato-based version that every other Italian restaurant in town serves.  For our entree, we ordered the mortadella e pistachio pizza to split ($17).  Despite having sampled a *lot* of pizzas of different varieties (traditional American, Neapolitan, \"fancy,\" etc.) around PGH, this pie is my favorite one I've tried in the city.  The pistachio lends a really unique earthy yet sweet/savory flavor to the pesto, making it unlike any other version of pesto I've ever tried.  Its unique flavor is complemented by undertones of saltiness from small cubes of cured mortadella, as well as the texture and subtle creaminess of fresh burrata mozzarella.  The only aspect of this pizza I found wanting was the crust, which was on the doughy side and lacked the characteristic crispness I enjoy in pizza crust.  Nevertheless, I'm willing to overlook this shortcoming due to the perfect marriage of flavors and textures endowed by the toppings.  For dessert, I tried a scoop of strawberry basil gelato ($2).  Its texture was creamy and its flavors were subtle yet delicious.  It's the type of dessert that grows on you rather than the type that captivates you at first bite but quickly overwhelms and tires your taste buds.  Initially, my dining companion said it wasn't his preferred type of dessert, but after savoring it for a moment, he quickly came around and really enjoyed it.  Aside from the food, we were impressed at how well run Piccolo Forno is.  All of the small yet significant aspects of the dining experience, such as clearing and bringing plates at the right times and bringing pre-organized split checks, were on point, as was the service.  It's quite clear why they're such a well-respected and attended restaurant in the PGH dining scene despite the plethora of new entrants in the Lawrenceville market.  Needless to say, we were quite impressed and would definitely return--if only I weren't moving out of PGH so soon.  4.5 stars.",

I didn't give any indication that I was interested in doing that and then she asks if I want to to. nope no thank you! if you don't have drinks here I just won't drink! we put in our order for food and she ask us again if we want to leave to get drinks. um the answer is still no. We receive our food and its just ok. I like to try new places out but based on the temperature of this place, the pushy service, and standard unexceptional food this is not going into my rotation.",

Would have preferred it with a wheat-based pasta. We also ordered the quattro stagioni pizza that came with mushrooms, artichokes, prosciutto and red peppers. It was excellent. Lots of flavor, and the crust tasted just like a wood-burning pizza should taste like.   We will definitely be coming back, and can't wait to try other things on the menu!",

    "text": "I enjoyed my dinner here last Friday night. I chose the restaurant due to its Yelp reviews and it's proximity to the hospice facility I'd spent day and night at for the precious few days. I'm not much of a drinker but I wanted a glass of wine, a decent meal, and a bit of fresh air. I got pretty much all of that here.   For wine...it's BYOB. If you're not from the area, that's a bit of a challenge. There is a wine bar next door, Grapperia, at which you can purchase a bottle and Piccolo Forno won't charge their corkage fee.   The restaurant was crowded with young families (with young children), 20-30s aged groups, older couples, and a large wedding/rehearsal dinner group. Even though it was not yet 6 pm, there was an hour wait for an indoor table when we arrived, so we chose to be seated outside (immediate seating at that moment but it filled within 5 minutes of our being seated).  The menu is limited, with some fairly heavy pastas, but they seem to make well the small number of items offered. Everything was fresh and delicious. The burrata with seasonal tomatoes was delicious: bright tomatoes and a creamy fresh burrata, which was heavenly with their focaccia (served on request, with butter). The tagliatelle with mushrooms was surprisingly toothsome, with fresh (housemade) tomato pasta. The pizzas are definitely popular here, so we ordered a margherita with pancetta added. The crust was nicely crisp and golden, with a chewy quality, and both the pancetta (not too salty, with an interesting smokiness to its flavor) and the mozzarella were good. It was more food than two people could consume, but they packaged the leftover pasta and pizza for us, thoughtfully adding in plastic cutlery and our leftover focaccia.  There was some trouble with people driving by and yelling obscenities about \"yuppies\" and an unstable man stopping at our table and accosting us verbally (yelling that we would never be truly \"rich\" like he was and trying to get us to give him our wine). It made us a bit uncomfortable, but this wasn't the fault of the restaurant or its staff.  It just let us know the neighborhood has probably been through some changes recently, possibly displacing people. My daughter and I needed a place to take a break from the sadness of our vigil at hospice, and Piccolo Forno provided that.",

The squid ink Spaghetti neri is pretty good--fresh and well seasoned.  Our service was impeccable.  I didn't much care for the atmosphere, though both times we've been stuck in the back portion of the restaurant, which made me feel as though I was at some Panera somewhere...when I am paying $20 a plate + drinks and appitizers, I do expect a bit more ambience than that.",

    "text": "Food: Piccolo Forno offers traditional Italian dishes, but it also offers numerous unique takes on Italian cuisine that seem both authentic yet new.  You can order lasagna or also get pasta dishes like you've never seen.  Both dishes we ordered were unlike anything we had tried at other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.  There are plenty options for vegetarians but also meat and seafood.  The soup was delicious and came with a giant roll in it, soaking up the soup.  The rotating desert options are multiple variations on the same theme (a bombe), which is basically a hard chocolate covered ice cream/cake ball shaped contraption (awesome), but they also have gelato/tiramisu.  The portions are large (enough to take home), and we were beyond full with soup, dinner, and desert.  The pizza is rumored to be good, and looked/smelled good, but we didn't try it.  Price: The prices are surprisingly affordable, with no entree over $20.  Our entire check for two came in at under $55 (two soups, two entrees, one desert, two coffees), cheaper than some lower quality places in the city.  You get your money's worth in terms of food quality and quantity, no doubt.  Drinks: BYOB.  Tables around us were drinking everything from bottles of wine, to bottled beer, to cans of Busch.  One table even had an entire bottle of Jack Daniels on the table they were passing around.  Atmosphere: The seating is tight, with tables packed close together.  You have to tread carefully to get to the bathroom without tripping over another table or knocking someone's drink.  This also leads to a pretty loud dining experience, because the place is always packed.  The dining room is simply decorated and there's not an eye-sore to be found.  A bigger dining area would probably be an improvement (see below).    Service: They do not accept reservations for a table less than 5.  So for those with less than 5 in their party, you fight through the mass of people at the front door and get on the list.  There is always a list.  We were offered a 2+ hour wait for a table of four, two of our party backed out, and we still waited over 90 minutes for a table of two.  We have drove to Piccolo Forno in the past at least 3 times, learned of the wait time, and went somewhere else.  Your best bet is getting on the list, then going to a nearby bar for a few drinks.  But once you do get seated, the service is quick and friendly.  The menus, food, and drink refills come early and often, likely to get you out of your table and someone else in it.  (+): Unique, delicious, and affordable take on Italian food with good service, if you can get a table  (-): Thats a big \"if\", and booze and a bar would make the waiting less painful  Would I go back again? We'll at least try.",

My expectations may have been too high.  We came in a little after 5 on a Friday night. Piccolo has been high on our list to try and we were already in Lawrenceville so I said let's just go now. We'll never not have to wait again. So in we went.   I know that this place was on the top 25 restaurants in the city so that probably made more people travel to Lawrenceville than normally would have seen this little gem. But the table decked out in full fur coats that had a member who couldn't get off the phone to eat his meal was a little absurd to me. This place serves pizza paninis and some pasta. It's BYOB. Showing off your \"wealth\" and important status made me laugh.   We ordered a Margherita Pizza as well as the Salmon Ravioli. The pizza came out super fast. It was great, I really enjoyed it and would love to try one with some toppings next time. I wasn't a big fan of the ravioli. Had I searched the yelp reviews for salmon I probably would have swayed away from this decision. The salmon seemed smoked, which I'm not a big fan of and I think if I'd seen it on the menu I would have stayed away. The salmon taste was overpowering.   So next time I'd bring some wine (which we didn't have) and order a few pizzas to try out different types.  Also, to the gruff server standing behind my boyfriend who upon seeing him stand up to go to the bathroom harshly said, \"what do you want\".... that's probably not the best way to greet someone. Just saying...",

    "text": "Delicious. We went for lunch on a weekday so it wasn't crowded. We ordered a pizza with speck and mascarpone, and lasagna bolognese. The pizza was really tasty; the crust was thin, crispy, and chewy with good flavor, the toppings were good quality, and the sauce was really nice with a fresh tomato flavor. (In fact, it inspired me to change my own pizza sauce recipe at home!) The lasagna was amazing. The layers of fresh noodles were perfectly tender and the meat and sauces had excellent flavor. I really look forward to going back and trying out more items.",

    "text": "Boy and I went to Piccolo Forno around seven on a Thursday evening. When we arrived, all the tables were filled and we were told that a table for two was a 25 minute wait.  Like other reviewers, we went to a neighboring bar until we were called back for our table. For the record, this does not bother me.  I more than expect there to be crowds and wait times when a business is small and popular!  Moreover, if one plans or calls ahead, it is easy to work around such things.  At any rate, the restaurant called us a mere 20 minutes later and upon our return, we were seated by a friendly host.     The menu offers many Italian appetizers, salads, pizzas, panini and pasta entrees. I looked around and realized most people ordered pizza. Boy and I each chose pasta, with him ordering the tortelli with pork and beef in a bolognese sauce. I opted for the salmon ravioli.  Boy's entree was delicious, but I was forced to do something I hate... return a dish. Something simply did not sit right with me. The salmon ravioli was tossed in a rather bland sauce.  I couldn't take more than a few bites.  Thankfully, our waitress was extremely gracious and let me pick something else (which happened to be the very tasty lasagna).  Even though we offered to pay for all three dishes, they did not charge us for the ravioli.    Something random I observed about the food. Piccolo Forno LOVES nutmeg.  Nutmeg is often used in bechamel sauce (which is in their lasagna), but I found it a tad overpowering as it was in all three pasta sauces we had.    Dessert was a delicious peanut butter gelato with a caramel center covered in chocolate. One of the better desserts I have ever had!   I will sum up with some pros and cons.   Pros:  The food was good (the dessert was better)! Service is friendly and helpful.  Cons: The restaurant is small, which can lead to noise and cramped seating. A little too much nutmeg.  Lastly, and this is just a silly pet peeve of mine, their website reminds me of MySpace in that it BLASTS music at you.    I'd like to go back and try the pizzas and paninis.",

I would say dress casually, but you can snaz it up a bit without looking like a weirdo and it's BYOB, so we just walked on down to the new wine store on the street and grabbed a bottle. The wait was about 25 minutes and they actually called our name as soon as we walked back up from the wine store. Perfetto!",

    "text": "Boy is it hard to get a seat at this place.  On my first visit we went as early as possible on a Friday evening and waited about 1.5 hours. They only take reservations if you have a party of 5 or more. This time around we had a group of 8 but could only get reservations at 9 pm on a Friday. We knew ahead of time that you entire party needs to be present before they will seat you however the party ahead of us ran over and we weren't seated until about 9:20.  The food here is worth the wait. I recommend their pizzas. They are baked in the brick oven with fresh ingredients all at a reasonable price.  I ordered the bianco with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella-just scrumptious and large enough to take a piece or two home. It tasted just as fantastic the next day. Others in our party ordered the pasta fagioli was looked delicious.  I was a little disappointed that they were all out of their specials since it was so late but I guess that is to be expected. This place is BYOB and they do charge a corkage fee of $5 per wine bottle and $1 per beer. Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job with the large party of 8.  The inside has such a warm and cozy atmosphere, makes you feel like you are in your Italian Grandma's kitchen!",

Anyways, I finally made the trek out to Lawrenceville this past week.  Fortunately, I was able to walk right up at 6pm on a Friday and get seated immediately.  Couldn't believe it, as I've heard this place usually has a decent wait on the weekends.  I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, which was cut into four separate sections topped with prosciutto, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and artichokes.   The sauce was sweet, and there was just the right amount of cheese on it.  This isn't a take out style pizza where people seemingly always want more cheese.  I liked it a lot.    Also had the Spinach Canelloni with Gorgonzola Cream.  This was excellent.  Creamy, rich, and baked perfectly .    In all, I had a great first time eating here.  The food is very affordable and you can BYOB ($5 dollar per wine bottle).  A little lacking in atmosphere as the interior is pretty plain and the the restaurant is small, but it's tasty and familiar food.  I'd definitely recommend it.",

I received excellent service during my Tuesday evening dinner.  I also give Piccolo Forno a few extra points for being a BYOB (just be sure to plan ahead).  Piccolo Forno has a great menu, and I would like to try a few more of their dishes (the rabbit, in particular).  I ate a lot at Piccolo Forno: bruschette for the first course, linguine with mussels and shrimp for the main, ice cream for dessert, and coffee.  I appreciated the fresh pasta, the sauce was tasty, and mussels tender and flavorful.  The bruschette was a poor choice on my part -- the out of season tomatoes were watery and bitter, which, when simply seated atop toast, makes for a bland dish.  I enjoyed the dessert (Dream Bomba I believe it was called), but a few fresh, housemade dessert options would perfectly compliment a fresh pasta dinner.    All in all a solid restaurant that I would be comfortable recommending to friends.",

Disappointingly, I have had abysmally rude hostesses both times I went (different women) and begrudgingly put up with that for the fantastic pasta. Fortunately, my waitresses have been lovely and one of them even got our food to come out quickly because we were in a rush. This is a BYOB establishment, though I believe their corkage fee is $6 (I remember it was on the higher side). A huge drawback is that they do not take reservations for fewer than five people and don't even use the No Wait app, so you will inevitably find yourself waiting a long time if you come during peak dinner hours (no matter the day of the week). In a head-to-head, I would recommend Piccolo Forno over Senti, another Italian place a few blocks away, also with homemade pasta, because I have found their food to be better, so that's my recommendation if you are in the area and looking for great pasta! I will definitely be returning (though crossing my fingers the rude hostesses will be gone)!",

I asked them to substitute the last time that I went to switch the two roasted red pepper pieces for extra olive tapenade and they obliged with no issue. I haven't tried too many of the pastas, but they look fantastic when they come out.   As far as complaints go, the one thing that bothers me is that the staff at the front always makes me feel uncomfortable. There is a bit of an air about them, but that seems fairly common for the Lawrenceville area. The tables are pretty close together, but the decor is warm.

    "text": "Piccolo-Forno is a cozy italian restaurant.  I liked the exposed brick walls, massive pizza oven and stylized black and white photographs of the Mediterranean decorating it.  They also have BEAUTIFUL tiling covering the bathrooms, it's worth making a trip to the water closet just to admire it!  It's a small place with a lot of small tables crammed in, so some times it felt a bit claustrophobic, like you were going to accidentally trip the waiter or  bump the feet of the patrons next to you with your feet.  My wife and I ordered the polenta appetizer and meatballs.  The polenta was light and fluffy and was served with delicious toppings like tomato, mozzarella and olives, I'd highly recommend them.  The meatballs were small, bland, and bone dry, but fortunately came with a tasty side of pesto sauce that went well with them.    We knew we had to try the pizza because we'd heard so many good things, and it's one of the specialties on the menu.  For our main courses she got the quattro mixed topping pizza with red peppers, artichokes, mushrooms and prosciutto.  I got the lasagna.  The mushroom was served with the traditional italian style with thin crust, and a minimalist approach to adornments.  Admittedly, we like generous cheese and toppings, but in this case we both felt the toppings were to sparse and left the pizza feeling lacking  and was too close to just eating plain bread.  My lasagna on the other hand, was absolutely PERFECT.  It was so savory it melted in your mouth and the balance of pasta, meat and cheese was as good as I've had.  We got the chocolate bomb gelato for dessert which was average, but had a hard chocolate coating, which put a different spin on it.  The bill for 2 came to $65 without drinks, which seemed high given the hit or miss dishes and cramped tables.  I've heard so many good things I really wanted to LOVE piccolo forno, but despite my high hopes, I could only like it.",

Once we told the server it was our first time, she gave some history about the place. Its BYOB which took us by surprise, we really wanted some wine, and be prepared to wait, it was an hour wait on a Friday night. Absolutely delicious, I highly recommend.",

Honestly, I ordered based off of one of the pictures that was posted on Yelp.  I was so entertained by the look and presentation of the Rotolo Trecolori that I forced myself to order it, and I am so happy that I did.  The crepe that the spinach, shredded carrots, and red peppers were wrapped in was perfectly light.  The combination of flavors and the addition of the delectable gruyere cheese sauce were what made this plate so memorable.  I cannot wait to come back here.  It is going to be hard to not order this plate again!",

For dessert the tiramisu was excellent. It's a nice restaurant with brick oven and white marble tables. As I said earlier be prepared to wait for a table. Boun appetito!",

    "text": "In sum, for those that don't have the time to read the whole review. The pizza is superb- order anything else and it is hit or miss.   I struggled on how to rate this. I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars. When the cooks prepare the meals correctly the food is absolutely amazing. Heck, one is tempted to eat the plate when they are finished. However, this is not the case EVERY time one eats here. I've eaten here 5 times in the past 6 months.   The lack of consistency is truly a travesty. I suppose if I dine here again, I would only order pizza. Pizza is the only item that  one can reliably eat a delicious pie every time. However, most other dishes are left longing, longing for someone to take the time to consistently season and prepare them properly EVERY TIME the dish is prepared.  I know others are bothered by the noise, well, it is noisy. I cannot dispute that. I can't say that the noise level bothers me too much. A few others have commented that the service is so-so. I would agree. Like the non-pizza dishes the service is also hit or miss.   I hope the owners carefully read the criticisms I offer. I want to love your restaurant, but when I order a dish one week and its amazing and the next week it is terrible- how can I justify giving this restaurant a rave review or be willing to even return? There are too many solid restaurants in the Greater Pittsburgh area to roll the dice on restaurants that are unable to consistently preform well.",

We got a drink at Roundcorner instead when we were waiting for our table.  They called us when our table was ready which was nice of them so we could take our time at the bar  Huge windows, exposed bricks.  The place is definitely cozy. We got a table in the middle of things. Literally in the middle of the restaurant so there was a lot of hustle around us.   The menu is really pasta and pizza heavy which isn't normally my game.  I am more of a seafood kinda lady but I put my carb conscious mind to rest and ordered a pasta dish. The pasta was in a light red sauce with shrimp and capers.  It was definitely delicious.  I also started with a butternut squash soup with was rich but not too creamy. Yum.   I think the service was good but I honestly can't remember and I normally do. So I guess thats neither good or bad.   Pro: Cozy, BYOB, delicious pasta   Cons: I wish they expanded their menu to actual entrees  Overall: If I am craving some pasta I will definitely be back!",

Initially, the thought of a small restaurant without reservations really turned me off, but last time we went at peak time, we drove over put our name in and then headed to Mount Washington. By the time we were done there, our table was ready.  I like that they are BYOB and they don't charge a fee per glass, but rather per bottle. They are famous for their pizza but I actually think ordering that is cheating yourself because their other dishes are really great. Their pasta is amazing! The bruschetta is amazing, the lasagna as well. There vegetarian dishes are not cop outs either which is a big plus for my family.",

Unfortunately, if you have to wait to eat here, there aren't too many places to explore and I would consider the area largely unwalkable.   Still, I think the pasta here is made properly and the pizzas are satisfying. However, I think they charge way too much for the amount of food that is served. Usually I pay $30/person when I visit Piccolo Forno.   I do like the BYOB! This has given me a chance to buy different wines and has reminded me of my days traveling through Europe.",

The crust was sooooo thin and light, bright crushed tomatoes and who doesn't love prosciutto?   Our service was outstanding and the atmosphere is great. A little loud, but that doesn't bother me. Great place to meet with friends or an intimate date night, too.   Other dishes at the table included a lasagna, ravioli and gnocchi that would \"gnocchi\" your socks off.

This is a small restaurant so I recommend coming in on a week night or early on a weekend so you don't have to wait (they only accept reservations for parties of 5+). It is also BYOB!   After being seated, we were greeted by our waitress, Julia, who was warm, welcoming, and proved to be very knowledgable of the menu. We started with the Quattro Formaggi (white pizza topped with fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, crotonese, and ricotta cheese) and each ordered a pasta dish. Our pizza came out within 10/15 and was AMAZING. I recommend that particular pizza if you're looking to start with a pizza, as it is very light compared to the others. Our pasta came soon after (they definitely give you time to enjoy each course) and smelled and looked great. I had one of their permanent menu items, Tagliatelle con Agnello in Umido. The lamb was cooked beautifully, tender and flavorful - overall the pasta dish was excellent. And very filling. My friend had the wild mushroom ragu pasta dish which also had great flavor. (Tip: they do not bring bread to the table with your entrees, but on request, you will receive the most buttery bread!)   We ended our evening with a desserts to share - Tiramisu and the Limoncello gelato. The piece of tiramisu was huge, and delicious. If you are not crazy about the espresso flavor, this is the tiramisu for you! I personally love the flavor, but my friend isn't a huge fan and really liked this it. And the gelato was very refreshing and tart. Overall, our experience was extremely enjoyable and relaxed. We will definitely be back!",

Note, no alcohol on the menu but I've read in other reviews that it's a BYOB kinda place.  I ordered the Margherita pizza (tomatoes and mozzarella) while my husband ordered the Piccante pizza (sausage and hot peppers).  While I appreciate the wood-fired oven thin crust, I must take issue with the Margherita pizza. Yes, it advertised crushed tomatoes.  I guess my brain didn't translate what that meant, though -- basically, a cheese pizza.  Oh, and basil? That, you had to order as an extra for $1.00.  Am I not correct that by definition the Margherita pizza comes with basil???  Add injury to insult, there was about one sprig of basil per slice.  Personally, I want my Margeherita pizza to come with sliced tomatoes and more basil (included in the base offerings). So, hmmfph.  Also, as a side note, I needed to ask if they took reservations for a future engagement.  Per the server, they do for parties from 5 to 8 people.  It's a small venue so fair enough.  Will I be back?  Maybe, but I'll definitely try something other than pizza.",

However, Piccolo Forno is one of my favorite restaurants in Lawrenceville, and I highly recommend it!  I've been to Piccolo multiple times, and I am always impressed with the service and the food. The restaurant is beautiful and has a homey Italian feel while still feeling hip. If you're lucky, you'll be seated by one of the large windows at the front. One of the things that I love about Piccolo Forno is the fact that it's BYOB. They do charge an uncorking fee, but it's nice to be able to bring your own bottle (or two!) of wine. Also, If you have a long wait for your table, I recommend going right around the corner to Grapperia for a cocktail. You will not be disappointed.  I honestly think Piccolo Forno has some of the best Italian food I've ever had. My favorite appetizer on the menu is the Torre Di Melanzane. It has layers of eggplant, basil, mozzarella, and other squash; it reminds me of a ratatouille, but even better. For an entree, I highly recommend both the lasagna and all of the wood fired pizzas. This is not my highest-ranked craft pizza in Pittsburgh (Mercurio's holds that coveted spot), but it runs a close second. All of the pizzas are flavorful, fresh, and authentic. I particularly love the Speck E Marscapone pizza which includes tomatoes, mozzarella, marscapone, and speck (which is a type of cured meat). You really can't choose a bad pizza here, so get a few different ones to try and take home leftovers!  Piccolo Forno is a wonderful place for anything from a date night to a group celebration. Sure, you may not be able to just waltz right in and get a table - but that just goes to show you that the caliber of food at Piccolo is worth waiting for!",

If you know me, I'm constantly on the hunt for delicious wood fired pizza. Some friends told me their favorite pizza of all time was from Piccolo Forno so I had to see what it was all about. My husband and I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, Pappardelle con Coniglio alla Garfagnana (braised spiced rabbit with pappardelle pasta), tiramisu and... Gosh for the life of me, I cannot remember the name of the dessert I ordered. It was a cappuccino gelato ball, really.   Anyway, the pizza had four toppings on four different areas of the pie, making it a nice sampling. The pizza was pretty good. Not too salty and pretty well balanced. My favorite topping was the prosciutto and my husband's favorite was the roasted red pepper. The mushrooms were my least favorite as they had a very strong smokey flavor, which I'm sure many might enjoy. Although the pizza was good, I liked the pasta more. All their pastas are made in-house which is really impressive. The braised rabbit and sauce of our pasta dish had a comforting, curry-like flavor which was perfect for a cold day.   Now. Onto the star of the show. The dessert!! My cappuccino gelato ball (I wish I could remember the name of this!) was AMAZING. As if plain gelato wasn't rich enough, the ball had a filling and was drizzled with caramel and chocolate syrup. I may come back just for this! The tiramisu was nice and light with an orange flavor. The entrees were good but the desserts were great!",

Ambience is warm and lively; food is always cooked to perfection; staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu; and best of all, it's BYOB. Best quality food at affordable prices. Don't forget to stop in for a drink at their Grapperia bar located behind Piccolo. Their bartenders serve up some of the best drinks in the city limits. You'll find some unique cocktails made with balsamic vinegar or lavender, to name a few; great craft beer; and of course an extensive wine list. Perfect spot for a date or dinner with a group of ten.

What an awesome place. A corner spot with lots of foot traffic. Great to sit outside at one of 5-6 tables in moderate weather. The menu was authentic and the lasagna was by far the star!! Thin housemade, handmade pasta with just the right amount of cheese and sauce. Supreme! Only downside to the evening was that they don't serve beer, wine, or spirits. However ,there is a wine bar around the corner and you can BYOB. Definitely recommend!",

We had a party of 4, so our quoted wait was only about an hour. We were able to wait in the bar around back and enjoy a beverage.The space was small and it's BYOB (which we knew in advance so we brought our own wine), but is was really pretty with the exposed brick and low lighting. Our waitress was fantastic and I wish I could remember her name.   Two people in our group ordered pizza and they each looked delicious. My mom said that their pizza was some of the best she's ever had. I'm more of a pasta lover, though, so I ordered the Cappelletti di Taleggio - cheese stuffed cappelletti, pistachio brown butter, brussel sprouts and balsamic.  It was so good I hardly paused for a drink and certainly scarfed it all up before I could offer anyone else a taste (whoops!)   We had a birthday in our group, which we casually mentioned, and our waitress brought us a piece of tiramisu (so good) and we also ordered coffees and limoncello gelato (delightful!)   Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves and their food, which is always a plus. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would love to return again when in town! Highly recommend it!",

But I didn't, I got the lasagna and it was ridiculously good. My wife got the tortelli (I believe it was called) it's sort of like tortellini, sort of like ravioli, but also- tremendous.

    "text": "Piccolo Forno, I heard so much about you. And yet I have a fear of bad Italian food so I avoided you and avoided you...and eventually I just had to bite the bullet and make a visit to the most talked about Italian joint in town. Could it beat the reigning champs of my Italian heart, Dish Osteria and Il Pizzaiolo?  The answer was no. The pizza here claims to be authentic, but it is not so. The crust is decent, though it could use a bit more char. Where it really goes wrong though is the sauce, which has a strong oregano taste. Generally, authentic Italian pizza uses just crushed San Marzano tomatoes and basil...and I'm not a fan of oregano, so I prefer when places just stick to that simple recipe. It wasn't the worst pizza ever, but it's not as good as Il Pizzaiolo in Mt. Lebanon, which is the only place in the state that is officially VPN-certified to make authentic pizza. If Piccolo Forno is the best pizza you've ever had, take a trip down to the suburbs and prepare to have your mind blown.  The pasta, on the other hand, was really delicious. The Maccheroni con Melanzane (basically Italian mac and cheese with eggplant) was creamy, cheesy, and awesome. Again, it doesn't compare to Dish, but I really liked it nonetheless. If I come back, I'll definitely skip the pizza and go straight for the pasta menu!  3.5 stars...but I'm rounding down because there is way too much hype for this place and ultimately the pizza was a let down. Not worth waiting 1-2 hours as others seem to have done, but we went early around 5pm and there was no wait at all, and still many empty tables by the time we left.",

The negatives are not the fault of the staff but of the owners I presume. The \"no substitutions\" is really off-putting for me. I don't eat any kind of sausage and some form of sausage is on most pizzas. They will take it off but refuse to replace it with mushrooms or any other type of product. I understand you think your recipes taste the best but you run a restaurant and need to take into account the dietary needs of others. I also disagree with reservations for 5 people or more. Either take reservations or don't. My husband and I shouldn't have an hour wait because 3 parties of 6 made reservations and can walk right in.",

It was quite literally the best lasagna either of us had ever tasted. We indulged in the tiramisu-it was a unique twist (I think they put in some type of lemon oil or mint?)-delicious.

I've been half a dozen or more times since I moved to Pitt and Piccolo Forno has never disappointed me.

Portions are extremely reasonable- I'm a normal sized, younger man and I'll eat 6/8 slices at dinner and not leave hungry. Prices feel extremely low (13-15) for a pizza of such insanely high quality. BYOB makes this place the highest value restaurant I can think of.   The only downside of the restaurant is that they do not take reservations. They will, however, call you so what I've always done- either in a group of 2, 3, 4, or 6, is to place the reservation and head across the street to round corner cantina to enjoy a drink while we wait. I recommend you do the same as the wait will often be 30-50 minutes if you arrive during prime time.",

However the friends I was with said they were well prepared for this type of wait, since they have been here before. So we checked in our wine, since the restaurant is a BYOB, and headed to the Round Corner Cantina for some pre-dinner drinks. I have to say the bar across the street must make bank, since people seem to wait for this restaurant and directly head to the bar.  When our two hour wait, which I have to give it to the hosts, their quote time was pretty accurate, was over it was on for me to finally see and taste what my friends have been talking about.  Their interior design reminds me of a little Italian place, especially with the open wood fired oven. Ugh! it was beautiful, like Tuscan Italy beautiful. And the atmosphere to go with it, just flowed, the waitress was hip and knew her stuff.  Now I knew we were going in to have their pizza, but I did get a chance to look at their website prior to our arrival and noticed that they have salads, pastas, appetizers, and desserts that may be worth trying one day. Actually I'd love to head back to try it all, that's how I feel about this place. It's definitely a hole in the wall, hip spot for all ages. We ordered their bruschetta, which also offer's roasted pepper spread and olive tapenade. They were perfect, a perfect start to the pizza's we ordered. Quattro Formaggi, which is their white pizza topped with four cheese, ricotto cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and crotonese.  We actually ordered two of these, and yes you could individually taste each cheese, absolutely amazing especially being baked in their wood fired oven. Our other pizza, which was just as amazing, Salsiccia e Cipolle, crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, sausage, red onions and fennel. And didn't we devour them all. It was such a perfect night, each pizza you could taste each individual ingredient, and that's not a bad thing because they all balance each other out. Ugh I'm hungry thinking about it. I give this place a thumbs up all the way. I can't wait to head back and try many of their different menu options.",

    "text": "Delicious Italian meals for affordable prices.  True Italian fare like it is meant to be.  Try the Insalata di Finocchio with the shaved fennel, oranges and red onion -- so refreshing!   The Lasagna Toscana melts in your mouth -- nothing like the congealed ricotta and sauce lasagna most restaurants try to pass off.  My husband loves the braised rabbit.  Wish they had wine but it is worth remembering to bring your own bottle just to enjoy the fare.  This place gets crowded and doesn't take reservations so get there early!",

    "text": "Dinner was fabulous!! We went early on a Saturday night around 5, which was the perfect time! They were busy, but there wasn't a wait for a party of 4.  The menu was unique.  The pizza oven is upstairs so you can watch them being prepared.  The kitchen is in the basement so they bring the meals up with a dumbwaiter.  We started with pizza as an appetizer which I recommend for sure!.  We had the featured pizza of provolone, mascarpone, prosciutto and sweet corn--delish.  We also tried the Capricciosa, which was also very good.  Next we had the house salad which had mixed greens, gorgonzola, red onion and tomato with homemade balsamic vinaigrette.  Nothing that out of the ordinary, but good and a nice light course.  I ordered the braised wild boar over fettuccini and it was awesome. It was wild boar braised in a thin red-wine tomato sauce with some carrots, celery and onion then tossed with homemade fettuccini noodles.  I did detect a slight hint of cinnamon or anise maybe?  Something a little different but not off-putting. It was so good, I'd order it again for sure. It was pretty big too.  I took more than half home and had enough for lunch today. My boyfriend had the lasagna he said it was just alright.  It had a lot of layers and he said the pasta was overcooked and a little mushy.        The service was also great, I felt like our server was prompt and professional...but we felt a little rushed...we we were still finishing one course and they were already bringing the next which is an issue only because the tables are so small.    I can't wait to go back!!   I'd definitely recommend.  It would be great for a date night or a girls night out.",

The pizza should have been baked at least another 2 minutes because my crust was on the raw side.  But I like a crispy crust that holds horizontally.  I don't know but maybe they don't make it that well done.  I want to go back and try some other salads and a pasta.  I thought the service was very good.  I sat next to a couple of guys who were pretty obnoxious and gave the waitress suggestions on how to improve the menu and she handled it very well.",

Seems like it is an upscale flatbread pizza place because I had the wild boar pasta dish and my wife had the lasagne and neither was that great.  I guess we expected more but I would prefer a good old Italian style tried and True lasagne to one with a different type of meat--maybe the boar.

The Lasagna was my favorite,  the Maccheroni wad a rigatoni dish covered in bechamel, and could definitely have used more veggies,  such as brocolli or asparagus.  I prefer lots of veggies with my pasta to offset the carbs, and for some reason,  they don't offer many veggies in any of their pastas. It was almost like you had to choose - pick protein,  or veggies,  but you can't have much of both. I found that strange.  Overall,  the quality was definitely there,  and I will go back to try the antipasti di mare and the tiramisu for sure. One of the better places in Pittsburgh that I have tried.",

    "text": "Initial thoughts: I've heard really great things about Piccolo Forno, but based on my experience, it's not really worth a try.   Parking: There is a parking lot a block or so in front of the restaurant that can be hard to notice if you're driving on the other side. Avoid street parking costs and park there for free!   Wait time: I came around 3pm on a Monday in February so there was no wait. The restaurant had only a few tables occupied.   Service: The hostess was fine. She told us to sit anywhere, and came around a few times to take our order, refill our glasses, and bring us our leftovers in to-go containers.   Main dish: We got the \"Butternut squash tortellini with amaretto brown butter sauce\" and \"Squid ink spaghetti with rock shrimp and squid.\" Both were subpar. The tortellini itself was good, but the sauce was pretty unappetizing. It was too sweet and didn't match well flavor-wise with the already sweet butternut squash. I felt like someone overloaded the amaretto extract, and it was just not that great. I would've like the tortellini by itself. The spaghetti was okay - somewhat bland and lacked both salt and herbs.    Cost: Around $20, more or less, for each dish. For this price, I expected much better.   Ambience: Casual Italian dining. Somewhat small.   Overall: Just okay. I don't think I would go back here based solely on the food. If the food was better, I would reconsider.",

    "text": "If you're going to go out to get wood fired pizza or handmade pasta in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go.  I'm going to tell you all a secret here - Piccolo Forno has a wood fired pizza oven that was built in Italy. It was shipped to the US and installed in this building with a small forklift by the owner of the previous restaraunt occupying this space. Here is another secret - All the pasta is made by hand. All of it. It is not bought down in the Strip district, or shipped from some warehouse somewhere. It is hand rolled, cranked and pinched just like your mom would make at home. If you're lucky enough to have a cool mom like that. ;)  The pizzas here are cooked in this amazing hardwood fired pizza oven, they are approx. 10\" which is the size of the plate they come on and they have a handful of options - Quattro formaggio (the four cheese pizza), Salsiccia cipolla (sausage and onion), Quatto Staggioni (four different toppings on 4 sections of the pizza), Proscuitto Funghi (Cured ham and seasoned mushroom) and the always classic Margherita pizza. There are also two versions of beautiful calzones avail served with sauce inside as well as on top. Occasionally there are specialty pizzas that pop up with toppings such as ramps, speck and duck if you can catch them. Traditionally, you are supposed to eat the pizzas with a knife and a fork, but hey this is Pittsburgh and we do what we want here, right?   The pastas change seasonally here. Sauces include a rabbit, wild boar, and a hearty Bolognese. Trust me, this stuff is amazing. You'll want to wish you could buy quarts of the stuff to take home.   The tiramisu is made onsite and is a real treat. There are awesome gellatos avail as well.   Piccolo Forno is a byob restaurant, so grab a bottle of wine or a few beers before you head over. They do get busy during typical weekend times (Fri and Sat nights), but they take reservations. Although they have space I would caution against parties of 8 or more since it's a small cozy place. The servers and FOH staff are really great and easy going, even when it's busy. If you get a seat in just the right spot, you can watch the pizzas and the fire inside the oven.   It's-a good!",

    "text": "At last, Yelpers! I've finally had the pleasure to experience Piccolo Forno! I should get a badge just for that! ;)   We arrived on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. I was amazed by how awesome the customer service was as the hostess was extremely friendly and offered to hold our wine for us since it's BYOB (My fav! $5/bottle). They call you when you're table is ready.  The place is relatively small, but it gives you a very intimate and cozy feeling. At times it seems a little crazy, but you can still hear the person across from you without having to yell. Tables are far enough away as well so you're not hearing conversation from the couple next to you.   Our server was very polite and made us feel very welcomed. She explained the menu to us and was super cool about everything. She suggested some good items as well.   The food was incredible. We were undecided on what to do for an appetizer and after seeing all of the amazing pizzas come out we went with that. We ordered the Bianca which was just a plain cheese and tomato pizza. I don't know how something that is \"plain\" can taste so good! It literally melted in your mouth! Not something you hear too often about pizza. We devoured it. Next up, I ordered the Rigatoni con Pesto as my entree. Heaven! What I thought was so interesting was the fact that there wasn't too much sauce on the pasta, yet it was so flavorful! A little truly goes a long way here. It was the perfect blend of not too dry and not an overkill with the sauce. The pesto taste wasn't overwhelming either. Bravo!   My only complaint is that the portions (specifically with the entrees) are a little small so I do recommend ordering an appetizer. Four slices of pizza and my meal (... and of course a bottle of wine!!) was plenty to fill me.   I can't wait to return and hopefully bring some new people along with me! I love showing people awesome gems like PN!",

I felt silly, and debated eating around the meat, but my husband spoke up and explained our situation. The waitress immediately apologized (again..my fault) and offered to have the dish re-made without meat. It came back fresh, delicious and super fast.

All at this one establishment.  I don't particularly like Italian food.   They take an old, \"Oh, I've heard that one enough times,\" type of cuisine and turn it into a sparkling, elegant, and majestic novelty. It's not a twist - it's a new implementation entirely. The baking and cooking of the carbs and meats turns the breads, pizza, rotollo trecolori pastry element, lamb, speck into an odyssey of texture.   So: get as much food here as you can.  I've never been more pleased to interact with a piece of inanimate material than the first time I ordered here, four years ago. I don't like things, high-end physical things - I prefer consumables.   I don't really like consumables either, but the really good ones get me sometimes.  This place gets me every time. Gets me happy. I do not regret a single unit of currency spent here.  I think the atmosphere is ideal. It's warmly lit, all light-toned hardwoods, with a big brick furnace in the center for baking in and an exposed kitchen. The bathrooms are ravishing. The tabletops are clean and comfortable.  p.s. BYOB. Wine place around the corner sells phenomenal wines, and wines and spirits is only a ten minute round trip walk, so if you are with somebody who isn't afraid of a short jaunt pre-dinner date, that works well too.  p.p.s food : Rotollo trecolori - the texture of the softest pasty you've ever had, and yet totally vegetarian. Made of blended roasted peppers, spinach, and carrots whipped up and packed tightly into the lightest, puffiest, yet still barely cohesive pastry shell. The sweetness of the carrots, the softness of the roasted red peppers, and the bite and warmth of the spinach each adding something different to their respective pastry shells, creating a series of three cloud-like pastry veggie objects with a progressive nature. The sauce it comes in - very warm, warm viscous green. Adds a slight brocolli warmth to each bite, and a bit of butter. Amazing.   Pizza with marscapone or ricotta on their sublimely dry sauce on their pizza with speck - soft, then the speck a slight bit chewy, then the slight crispiness on the edge of their overall soft pizza creating a kind of looping event out of each bite, an excellent experience, all flavors a soft savory, the mouthfeel being unbelievably in control. Amazing.  Appetizer, meatballs of some kind - comes with a pesto. This pesto is very light on the nuts, and it creates something that allows a sense of cleanliness in this sauce that is warmed overall by the meatballs themselves. Top quality, new, inventive - like a high-end appetizer should be, but so often fails to be. Amazing.",

I haven't ever tried to beat the dinner crowds, because I've heard it's so hard to get a table here in the evenings.  We usually like to get an appetizer, a pizza, and a salad to share - never lets us down, although I will say that their pappardelle and coniglio (rabbit) dish is also amazing. We've had most of the things on the menu, and I can honestly say that nothing has ever let us down. We like the funghi and prosciutto pizza the best, although the one with arugula is crazy delicious as well.  We haven't ever had bad service here in the many, many times we've visited, and I think it's because we are visiting at less busy times. This would definitely be a difficult place to bring a large party to, unless you had worked out reservations well in advance.  Love it. Will be back. Often. Hope you enjoy it too... but not too much, because then it would be hard for us to get in!  Ah, I almost forgot - parking sucks if you can't get into their small lot across the street from Round Corner Cafe. Be willing to hoof it a bit, but it's well worth it!",

The braised beef short ribs on top of it was slimy and had an awful taste to it.  Two bites & I was done.  Luckily, the server was kind enough to take it off our bill.  But from his comment, they must have a problem with these \"gnocchi\" being under cooked.  Husband had the lasagna.  2 thin slabs of lasagna which he ate, but wasn't impressed with.  He cut off a small piece for me and it ran all over the plate.  Not very good.  Most Italian restaurants that we've been to give you a nice thick, meaty piece of lasagna.    Place is very small and extremely noisy.  All you keep hearing is the clanging of plates.  Stay away!",

Fact number one, our server was wonderful, but the greeter at the front door had the personality of a senior employee at the DMV. Show up with your entire party at one time, or wait for them in your car. Speaking of cars, fact number two, there is off street parking available for patrons, free of charge. Third fact, most important fact, BYOB... they do charge for a cork service, so bring your own chilled wine and they'll gladly serve it to you.  You may be wondering how this little joint, full of so much difficulty, is deserving of a 5 star rating. It's simple, I can say beyond a reasonable doubt, that I may not have know what real food tasted like, until I tasted the food they serve at Piccolo Forno! That is not even close to an exaggeration! From foods that I can barely pronounce, to the gelato crafted in house, anything you get here is guaranteed to please! I will certainly jump through the hoops to return to this classy little hole in the wall every opportunity I get! Oh yeah, the prices are actually quite reasonable. Be sure and grab an appetizer as the portions are well controlled.",

Imagine, after the article, we expected lines around the block and a sublime experience. We split the pomodoro, e bufala (caprese by any other name) which was competent, but spare us the attitude when we ordered it as a caprese. Kath had the tortelli bolognese, sauce was good, pasta mushy (overlooked to blob consistency). I had the quatro formaggi. Which we are going to herby name quatro blando. No zip no zing no pizzazz.   Ok, the tab was reasonable, but the experience was unmemorable. Curse of the top drawer press!",

We went at around 5:30 thinking we could beat a dinner rush since they don't make reservations. Boy were we off on that assumption it was a full house. We were told there was about a 70 minute wait, but they offered to hold our wine (BYOB) and would call when ready. This was made ok by Gapperia.  It was our time to eat at the time we were told our wait would be. We ordered a prosciutto rucola pizza and the butternut squash tortellini. The crust to sauce to cheese ratio was perfect! The homemade noddles I am still daydreaming about. Everything was full of flavor and fresh. We finished our meal by splitting a peanut butter chocolate gelato that was rotating in the menu which was amazing.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The decor is simple and tho it is very small inside you don't feel like you're on top of the table next to you. We will be back!",

Server had an attitude after asking how everything was. When I told her that actually I didn't care for my dinner she asked if I wanted something else. Normally I would just smile and say no it's fine but this was so bad and not cheap either that I asked for just some noodles in marinara. And THAT was mediocre at best. My friend had to ask for salt and pepper and cheese to give her food some taste.   Dessert was ok. The tiramisu was very odd. No espresso flavor or chocolate just strong lemon  I've eaten all over Italy and never had  food that looked or tasted like this. This is certainly not representative of Italian cooking in my opinion.   Won't go back.",

    "text": "Wearisome waits, lingering lushes, surly service, hapless hostesses and mediocre meals. Bottom line, Piccolo forno has quickly gone from great to ghastly.   My parents used to enthusiastically shuttle me to this restaurant when I would come home for the holidays to try some of their signature pizzas and pasta dishes. I admit I would always crave the tuscan beans a little bit on the way in the door. Then something strange happened. My parents started to be reluctant when I would ask to go there, saying that the waitstaff treated them rudely and really spoiled the otherwise good food.   Fast forward to our last visit, (likely my 10th time and my parents' 30th) and my dad started grumbling about the \"joyless\" manager before going in (a rather sour bald man)--I knew there was going to be trouble. I usually chalk these things up to senior moments but my dad is a service connoisseur--and very sensitive to slights. After being told we would wait for 45 minutes (which, again, is pretty stunning for a place in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday night), we checked in at 30 and the hostess pointed our table and the party was paying, and said we should be seated shortly. After the table paid, while we were standing there, the group asked the restaurant to open another bottle of their BYOB wine while we waited like fools for 45 more minutes. I'm sorry, but it is not a good business strategy to be miserable to waiting customers and so obliging to customers lingering around over a second bottle of wine that you're not even making money off of that the waiting customers leave. You want to be a real Tuscan restaurant? Take reservations and plan out your evenings. You want to be a little piece of New York in Pittsburgh? Don't take reservations and tell the lingerers to move along. You want to be a Pittsburgh restaurant for a long time? Don't treat familiar faces with scorn and act as if there were no other options in town. What a shame how bad staff can ruin a great place.",

The appetizers are fine -- the brushetta is good. But the pasta. Oh, the pasta. It's all reasonably priced ($11-$16) and on a recent visit I decided to get the more expensive shrimp pasta.   Now, by the description it sounded like it would be in a garlic oil sauce with crushed tomatoes. It came with a thick paste of tomato sauce that was overwhelmed by capers. I like capers when they're an addition to the flavor, but these were the flavor. That and an extremely fishy taste to the sauce really ruined it for me. But if that hadn't, the terrible pasta would have.   I've never before had fresh pasta that I thought was inedible. Thankfully there was a generous amount of large plump shrimp to almost make up for the inedible pasta and sauce. But I left hungry. My dining companion's pasta dishes weren't much better. The gnocchi was edible but gummy and there was a salmon ravioli special that was overwhelmingly salty.  Also, the wait staff seems either rushed or inattentive. We waited for everything and my soup was forgotten.   I'm not wasting my time again. Dinette has better pizza and anywhere has better pasta.",

    "text": "I have really mixed feelings about this place.  I could definitely see someone who is into the type of vibe this place provides giving them 5 stars.  I just was not a huge fan of several aspects of Piccolo Forno.  I went here because I wanted homemade pasta.  I will say that my meal, the spinach ravioli was very good...not great, but very good.  The appetizer of bruschetta was also good, as was my wife's pizza.  Having said that, there are a few things I did not like.  One, there is no customization options with any of their pasta dishes.  If you simply want their homemade pasta with regular tomato sauce, they won't do it.  This seems odd to me with how many people nowadays who have specific food types they eat or avoid.  Another thing that I did not like was how limited the menu was.  There are very few options for the appetizers, pasta, and pizza.  Finally, I did not like the atmosphere.  It was way too stuffy and I felt like my wife and I were being too loud.  If you are into a place that has very select food, where people spin their wine in their glasses trying to look cool, while whispering to each other...maybe you will enjoy it here.",

First off Butler Street where it is located is a very hip place right now - lots of other restaurants, shops etc to peruse if you have to wait for a table like we did. Also, be advised they have dedicated parking at the lot across the street (to the right as you exit the restaurant). We sat in the window in the front of the restaurant and brought our own wine (it's all BYOB). The menu has lots of options and they had some appealing specials. We opted for make your own pizzas and the pasta special, which was tortellini. We also got the beets, grilled radicchio & burratta salad appetizer. All the food was delicious. The pizzas were wood fired and generous portions. The salad was a real standout; very flavorful and unique. Our server was on point and the restaurant was crowded and lively without being overwhelming. Great spot for a classy meal.",

This time around we started with two appetizers: the mixed salad - your standard mixed greens salad with delicious and beautiful slices of large radish, topped with a very tasty vinaigrette; and a plate of buttata, fig, and fennel which, if I'm being honest, was out of this world. There's nothing like some creamy, savory, melt-in-your-mouth buttata paired with a sweet, delectable fig! Delicious!  I ordered the lasagna for my main course. Two delicious slices of layered heaven! Great meat sauce, authentic bechamel sauce, and layers of cheese.. how can you go wrong? I've lived with a number of families in Italy and I can honestly say that this lasagna reminded me of them!  A friend ordered the four cheese pizza, which was also quite delicious. I will say, though, that without the Gorgonzola it would be slightly bland. The crust is quite delicious though.  For desert we got the chocolate gelato bomb, which, while tasty, was nothing special. It literally tasted like chocolate ice cream covered with coco powered and nuts. I'm also fairly certain it was ice cream and not gelato.. Overall we had a great experience, though I think that recent menu changes are trying to be too fancy, leaving less choices for a wider number patrons. For example, I know many people who won't even touch rabbit, duck, and certain cheeses (though I certainly wood!). I still love coming back every time I visit the Steel City!",

Definitely a good idea to come and put your name in, then walk around and maybe grab a drink while you wait... or bring extra if you're sitting outside while waiting to have a few glasses of wine while you wait. You can't make reservations unless your party is above 5-8 from what i understand, but worth the wait. We will definitely be returning! Friendly staff, very attentive. Loved it!",

The Fagioli, Tonno E Cipolle salad was full of flavor and he perfect balance of lettuce to toppings in my opinion. This was large enough to share with my husband. I then had the margherita pizza which was also full of flavor. Pizza was 8 slices I think and enough for two people to share or to have left overs!   Will definitely be back and can't wait!",

Arrived at 5:30 for our scheduled reservation, and had to wait until our full party arrived to sit. When they did, we had to wait a bit longer for the table to be arranged. It is quite a small dining room, so if you don't have a reservation, I would be prepared to wait a while. Our server was very charismatic and charming, and knowledgeable about wines and the menu. I got the Tortelli. It was good, and authentic, but nothing I don't think I couldn't have made at home. However, I think it's easy to be a critic of Italian food, as most of us can make pretty decent Italian without a culinary background. The real star of the meal was the bread. It was phenomenal, warm, and I couldn't get enough of it. Paired with whipped butter, it was perfection. Everything about this visit was good, but I don't know if it would be worth the wait or price tag.",

The pizza was very good, probably the best we've ever had. We split the lasagna, the portion size was big. It was good, really enjoyed the homemade noodles. However, the downfall was the nutmeg spice that was added to it. You could smell cinnamon as soon as it was delivered to the table. It was also cold in the middle. It looked hot when it arrived, you cold see steam, when you bit into it, it was cold. Most likely reheated. Overall, we enjoyed our visit.

However, the food inside is very well prepared and you always get what you pay for.  The prosciutto+arugula pizza and the melanzane al forno are my personal favorites.  The bruschettas are always fresh and the insalate rucola just has the perfect balance of bitterness, crunchiness and acidity.  Hands down It is the best BYOB in Pittsburgh.

They do not take reservations but the meal is always worth the wait, which has never been extremely long. I try not to go during the dinner rush, I like to eat a little bit later, so I avoid the very long waits.  The Lasagna is so amazing! There are so many layers and the pasta is so thin. There is also a beschemel sauce on it that just makes it so perfect! It comes out piping hot also and the ingredients taste very fresh.  I always have the soup of the day and it's always great. My favorite salad is the mozzarella and tomato. The salads are large portions, enough for two people to split for a first course.  If you have room for dessert, splurge on the Tiramisu with an epresso or black coffee. If you don't finish it, the staff will package it up for you to take home. My brother loves the gelato, he orders it every time.   The service from the servers is always great. They are prompt and visit the table often. They are knowledgeable about the menu offerings. I have a gluten intolerance and they happily accommodated this, and told me what I could order.",

With the wait, we had appetizers elsewhere. For my entree I had the braised boar with vegetables on top of fettuccine. It tasted fairly good but I was expecting more, especially after such a long wait. I was also able to taste the pasta squares in white wine and artichoke duck sauce which I was not particularly fond of. For dessert I split a lemon gelato that was very good. The saving grace of the restaurant for me was that it was BYOB and not terribly pricey.  The bottom line is that I would not pick this as a place to eat again although I would go if others wanted to.

As she noted, even though we arrived relatively late, there was still a wait, so we headed across the street to Franktuary to have a drink.  I didn't mind the wait so much with a beer in front of me, and the 20 mins or so went pretty quickly.    The pizza we ordered (4 cheese) was excellent, as was my main - Tortelli.  The meat inside was nicely seasoned and flavorful, and the pasta shell was perfectly done.  I love BYOB restaurants - especially when they have great food.  Nicely done Piccolo Forno!",

Well, she didn't come back for about another hour and that was only to slip our check on the table !  We will be returning to Piccolo for our tiramisu but making it very clear Amber will not be our server.",

My group of 6 called ahead to make reservations for dinner on a Saturday but the reservations were all filled.  We decided to go anyway and knew we would have to wait.  We walk in to put our name on the list.  The hostess was extremely short and seemed like she didnt want to be bother with walk-ins.  \"We are packed on Saturday nights, and it will be an hour and half wait.\"  We were fine with that. \"We book up months in advance for weekend reservations.\"  Ok, we get it, still fine with waiting. \"We dont have a waiting area, so you have to give your number and Ill call you. \"  Totally expected this, not a big deal.  (Imagine this with a huge attitude, as if this is the only restaurant in the world that is ever packed)  My group walks across the street to round corner for a beer.  You can imagine the surprise when 20 minutes later the hostess calls and tells us our table is ready.  We quickly finish our beers, pay the tab and run over for our table.  Well......we walk in and she is surprised to see us.  She says she made a mistake and called the wrong party.  WHAT?!!  We just \"chugged\" down our drink and \"ran\" over here because we didnt want to loose our precious table and \"you made a mistake.\"  She didnt really apologize and sent us away again.  We walked across the street to Frankutary.  They have a very nice selection of beers on tap.  Then the wait was another hour and ten minutes.   The good news is, when we went back the manager greeted us.  She apologized and brought a pizza to our table immediately.   (Which is good, because I had 2 beers on an empty stomach, I was ready to eat!) The waitress was really nice and got our orders in promptly.   The food is really quite good!  The pasta is fresh and cooked perfectly!  The pizzas are thin and crisp.   Really too bad that some of the staff needs an attitude check!",

Our wine glasses were dirty, and as we asked our waitress for clean ones she placed two plates on the table, which we noticed were also dirty. My boyfriend's fork also had to be replaced due to food grime. The table next to us were two construction workers who were way too comfortable and loud for our liking. We assumed they knew the owners/manager or would have been asked to quiet down. The food was ok. Over priced for sure. My boyfriend's pasta was undercooked so he asked for bread (which I should add we had to ask for, while it was given to the construction workers) and just used that to eat the sauce around the pasta. I have heard really good things about this place, but I am not likely to return.",

PF, why must you treat customers so rudely? You are not a Michelin restaurant; you don't get to have \"seatings.\"  We had the same issue some other reviewers. Most of our party arrived at 7pm, but I was late. They wouldn't let them order. Thankfully, I texted in my order. They reminded my group repeatedly that they had another group at 9pm. Guess what? The 9pm group never showed, and the whole \"rush through dinner\" thing was mute.  Also, the food arrived in staggered courses. If you're going to have these strict seatings, then you should time the food to arrive together. My pasta is getting cold while I'm waiting for my friend's pizza, but I'm nervous that I won't finish by the 9pm required finish time so I feel like I should start eating. It's awful.  There have great pizzas at Porch and Mercurios and great pasta at Dish and Girasole. Don't put up with the rudeness; go somewhere else.  When the 9pm party didn't show, we ordered dessert. The dessert ice cream bomb is ridiculous good.",

We've been a few times and are always anxious to go back. Yep, we've had pizza of all sorts (with our wine), pasta of all sorts (with our bottle of wine), soups and salads (yep, you guessed it, with our wine) and EVERYTHING has been amazing. The salads are imaginative and filled with fresh ingredients. The pasta is delicious and varied to the point you can get braised boar or braised rabbit with it if you're so inclined. The spinach tagliatelle with the tomato and olive lamb ragu is a clear winner. Or you can try one of my favorites - the Tortelli - yummy dough pockets filled with a blend of pork and beef in a spectacular Bolognese sauce. And the pizzas? Wood fired delights that are covered with fresh mozzarella and a selection of toppings that would make your Italian grandmother envious. I like the Margherita with the option of adding prosciutto, speck, tuna, and gorgonzola.  Eat here. Bring lots of wine. Sit back and enjoy. Oh, and save me a seat.",

I believe you can call ahead and put your name on the list, but am not 100% positive about that.  THE FOOD has consistently been excellent.  All of the pizzas are interesting and delicious.  There are rotating seasonal menu items, and usually a special risotto every night.  Ask your server to be honest about what to get, and you likely will not be disappointed.  I have always succumbed to their desserts, only to be soothed into a post-supping coma, never into a ranting rave of disappointment or dejection.

Because my friend and I started with the charcuterie plate, I was full after eating half of my pasta. This was absolutely perfect, because I was able to enjoy the pasta again the next day for lunch!  My other favorite thing about this place is that it is BYOB. How perfect! I can't wait to go back and try the pizzas!",

Unfortunately, there were a few of us that were running a few minutes late (since you can't be seated until all members of the party are there) and the hostess informed my friends that were there, that they planned on giving our table away.  Upon arrival, the hostess was very snotty and basically pointed in the direction of the table and stated that we could sit down.  The moment the waitress came over she was rushing us to order everything.  Every 3 minutes she came back over and was pushing to order.  We were taking our time.  They were busy, but not busy to the point where they were on a wait or people were pressing to get it.  Throughout the entire meal the waitress was just very short and rude to my entire party.  The food at Piccolo Forno was spectacular.  Could not have been more please with everything that we ate.  Because of the beginning to end experience I could not be more disappointed with the service and the staff. Learn how to treat people!!!  The only time I will plan on getting food from here will be TAKE OUT!  BEYOND DISAPPOINTING!!",

It was 9pm on a Saturday night.  The hostess told us it was only 10 mins, so we decided to stay.  It was a warm night, so we opted for the outdoor seating.  My boyfriend and I decided to split a caprese salad and pizza.  Every smell coming from the other tables was so amazing, I couldn't wait for our food to come.  We were not disappointed!  The salad was fresh and yummy, and ohhhh my was the pizza good.  We couldn't help but polish off every last slice!  My only regret was not bringing a bottle of wine since it is BYOB.  Next time (and there will be many \"next times\") we will be better prepared.  HIGHLY recommend!",

It's very loud, it's BYOB, and the food is fantastic.  I had the Cavatelli con Salsccia e Rapini, which was amazing and I will order this again.  People rave about the Lasgna, although I don't think that is their best dish.  I love the Crostini di Polenta, it's a perfect appetizer.  The Bomba is always a fun dessert.",

    "text": "Of all the cuisines this city has to offer, there is none quite as satisfying as Italian fare done right.  Robust, herbal sauces mingle with potent cheese and pillowy, freshly-made pasta, culminating in some of the most well-rounded dishes in the world. I know how that sounds... Pretentious. I genuinely love all cuisines from cultures all accross the world. I am an adventurous eater... But there's something about Italian food. Unlike with many cuisines, Italian is generally enjoyed by the majority of people. It's rarely overwhelming or \"too weird\" for anyone. It's comforting, like a warm hug enveloping you from within.  Now, all of this applies especially to GREAT Italian food. Anyone can make boxed pasta, but real hand-made Italian food is a thing of beauty.  My boyfriend and I came to Piccolo Forno with his dad and aunt. We were seated quickly and attended to with little to no wait any time we needed anything. We started with salad and bread. I ordered Rotolo Trecolori, or Tri-Color Crepes. These are not traditional folded Crepes, but instead are rolled around the fillings. They consisted of Spinach, Carrots, and Red Peppers, and were topped with a pesto and gruyere cream sauce. My boyfriend, Chris, got the Tagliatelle Con Sugo Di Funghi, pasta with dry porcini and mushroom ragu. His dad got the Salsiccia E Cipolle, a brick oven pizza with sausage, fennel, crushed tomatoes and onions. His aunt wanted something less adventurous, and ended up getting an off-menu item that was the equivalent of spaghetti with red sauce. All of us besides his aunt shared. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was spectacular! Every detail from the house made pasta to the fresh and balanced sauces was spot-on. From what I heard, even the simple pasta with red sauce was \"SO VERY GOOD!\"  Piccolo Forno does a service to the tradition of from-scratch Italian food. I think any Italian Grandma with a binder full of recipes would be proud, although... I'm sure she'd tell you hers is better!",

It's BYOB and reservations are for groups 5 and more - so tonight was the perfect night to go.   Our waitress Julia was very informative and was able to answer all our questions (regarding the most popular pizzas and pastas)   We started with a pizza to share. We split the Quattro Formaggio (a white pizza topped with fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, crotenese, and ricotta) - it was delicious. It was the perfect pizza pie to share for an appetizer. It was light and refreshing.   For my main course (I went with Julia's suggestion over the traditional lasagna) - I tried the Fettuccine con Sugo di Funghi (porcini and wild mushroom ragu with porcini funghi and grated truffles percorni) - it was amazing and i would definitely get this dish again. My friend got Tagliatelle con Agnello in Umido (the braised lamb dish) - she let me taste it and it was out of this world. It was amazing.   For dessert- I opted for the Limoncello gelato (it was the perfect ending to this meal) - My friend ordered the Tiramusi (it was so good I'd order it next time as well)  Overall, I enjoyed my Thursday night at Piccolo Forno and will be back again soon.",

Definitely fresh but very bland and there was no salt and pepper on the table and I felt uncomfortable asking for some. It is also byob and the ice bucket for my wine was very small and only had a few ice cubes, so it was never properly chilled. They also pack a lot of people in such a small place and so it felt super cramped with people knocking into tables and chairs.",

    "text": "You've gotten too good for me PF.  I remember when I first met you and you welcomed my family in and made me feel at home.  Service was stellar and you appreciated the business. Years have passed and, frankly, you've become a real bitch.  I understand you cannot accommodate parties over the size of 8.  We brought in 10 and I know it's not fair, even with a phone call warning.  We phoned in earlier that day and tried to split our party, but you just weren't having that.  Why can't we split a party of 10 to two different tables on a phone in reservation PF, why?    Your hostess and server on the evening of 3/26/19 let us know how terrible and presumptuous we were for bringing in a party of 10, instead of 8.  Numerous times.  It's as if they had to repeat it a number of times just to convince themselves that they were in the right.  As fate would have it, a two-top opened up right next to our reserved table and it seemed like a 'stroke of luck' for us to be able to add that to our table of 8.   But your hostess was not having it.  She quickly seated that table so we would not even have a chance at getting a taste of what real good service is.  Your food is good I will give you that, but not 4-star worthy.  Did I even have dressing on my Insalata Misto?  Who knows.  Maybe the \"misto\" is that you just receive a 'mist' of dressing on your salad.  Surely this is to reflect the 'mist' of service you offer guests.  I liked the pizza.  It was tasty.  It would have been best eaten at my house.  Your server made us feel unwelcome and was just full of bad news right out of the gate, like informing us of items not available for the evening, why our food was running late and then, I think, he just disappeared.  Probably for the best.  Anyhow, I think you're just too good for me and your service reflects this.  When a restaurant reaches the fame you have, there is only one way to go.  Best of luck to you PF.",

    "text": "I have worked a block away from Piccolo Forno for 7 1/2 years and never thought of stopping in until today...on my lunch break.   Whenever I ride past Piccolo Forno in the evenings, they are usually brimful to the point where the restaurant's well-heeled clientry are well-nigh spilling out onto the sidewalk as they dine, and that's when they're not peevishly running in front of your car without looking both ways to get inside the place. Combine that with my rock-and-roll hours, and getting a table at PF hasn't exactly been convenient for me. Geniunely, my long-time nearness to PF and its perpetually bustling nature after dark has often caused me to forget its existence. At best, it had over time plainly become \"that Italian place down the street I never get to go to,\" much like the defunct Tambellini's of my native Brookline used to be; I've passed it a trillion times, but I have no chance of eating there.   Last night, I got the crazy idea to try PF for *gulp* take-out. After all, it said here on Yelp that they offered it. So I checked out the online menu. Pasta would be too much hassle. Pizza would take too long.   A-ha! They offer panini! It's a sandwich. I might be able to manage that sans employment suicide,\" I said to myself.   \"Besides, they never appear to be busy during daylight. This may work.\"  As 4PM approached, my back tingled, my stomach gnarled, my hands were washed of grime, and I marched over to Piccolo Forno.   The tales of snobbery, rushed service, and counterfeit cordiality have been burned from my mind for as soon as I entered (infiltrated?) the establishment, I was greeted by a twentysomething kid with curly hair, a downy moustache, and a white t-shirt. Behind him was a brick oven that contained smoldering orange coals and resembled the face of a jolly fire giant.   \"Hey man,\" I said, \"you guys do take-out, right?\"  \"Yeah bro. You on break?\"  \"Yeah, I work a block down. Listen, I need something quick to go. Can you help me out?\"  \"Of course, man,\" he reassured me with a smile and a mild laugh, already reminding me of some of my better co-workers.   I was handed a menu, and quickly I scanned it for panini, trying to remember just what I wanted to sample, finally arriving on something called Lucchese  \"That one.\"  \"Ok man, good choice. 6 minutes. Sit tight.\"  A young woman came over to ring me out and about...10 minutes later I got my food in a plastic shopping bag.  \"Thanks bro. Enjoy,\"  I returned to work with 20 minutes to spare--plenty of time to enjoy my lunch, which I enjoyed for the most part.   The Lucchese is a Camaro of sandwiches. Within a half-dome of ciabatta bread softened by pesto I found prosciutto, roasted peppers, fresh, oozing mozzarella... a sliver of Arcadia. One could complain that the prosciutto was a little scant, but this isn't the kind of ham one piles 2 inches thick a la corned beef. Prosciutto is too fragile, too subtle in its balance of sugar and salt, too aromatic for gluttony. It is rare, it must leave you wanting more, and it did in this instance. The roasted red peppers were almost unnecessary but welcome. The milky mozzarella, which formed beautiful strands as I pulled the panini from my teeth, made the panino legend, complimenting the prosciutto fully.   If I had to deduct a star, it would be for the absolutely dull lima bean (?) salad that needlessly came with the sandwich. Only some scallions could be found amongst the beans, and no olive oil or seasoning was detected in the drearily mild dressing. It was the gustatory equivalent of an awkward silence after a tryst. Aside from that misstep, this was a minor marvel of a midday meal. Molto bene!  P.S. On my end, the service was mannerly, amiable, prompt, and thoughtful. I was even offered a glass of water as I waited for my takeaway lunch.   P.P.S. Oh you know the goonies at work were eyeballin' my food.  \"Didju get dat at Subway? When'd they start sellin' 'em wit dat weird ass bread?\"  P.P.P.S. The damage? $7.50. Not bad if you ask me. Hey, the Wendy's down the road will beat you for more. That's no lie, either.",

    "text": "I finally made my long overdue first visit to Piccolo Forno last night. The place was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday, which boded well for the quality of the food but poorly for the prospect of ever dining there on a Friday or Saturday. Fortunately there were a couple of tables available and my companion and I were seated right away.  We started our meal with the speck and mascarpone pizza, which came highly recommended by our charming and attentive waitress. The pizza was by far the best I've had in Pittsburgh, which may seem like damning with faint praise given the lamentable quality of the pizza in this town, but this pie was truly excellent. The crust, a common failure point for most local pizzerias, was perfect: fresh and airy with just the right amount of char on the bottom. The sauce was flavorful and properly balanced with the creamy mascarpone and savory speck.   After we devoured the pizza we decided to try some pasta, opting for paccheri with tomato and ground boar ragu. The pasta was fresh and well made, but I found the ragu fairly pedestrian. Not a bad dish, but far from the standout that was the pizza.  For dessert we shared the tiramisu, which I'd read on Yelp was delicious and generously portioned. While I certainly cannot argue with the latter, I must disagree with the former. What little coffee and chocolate flavor the tiramisu had was overwhelmed by an excess of orange zest or perhaps liqueur.  All told, I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Piccolo Forno and look forward to trying more of their fantastic pizzas (though it will be hard to resist ordering the speck and mascarpone again). I'll also be sure to bring a bottle of wine to take advantage of their BYOB policy, another point in PF's favor.",

    "text": "A lower Lawrenceville staple in my book, serving up delicious Tuscan-style thin crust brick oven pizza and various other dishes like soups, salads, and pasta.  But, more often than anything, I come here for their pizza.  For this style of pizza, Piccolo Forno makes some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh, second only to Il Pizzaiolo's (among the places I've tried).  Because I live a few blocks away, most of my experiences here have been stopping in for a quick soup or panini during an off-hours late lunch or getting takeout pizza.  The food is consistently delicious, and I have tried a lot of the menu.  My favorite items are the Torre di Melanzane (eggplant/tomato/mozzarella appetizer), the Salciccia e Cipolle (sausage pizza), and the lasagna.  I've enjoyed several of their soups, including an amazing butternut squash, and paninis for lunch.  When it isn't crowded or busy, the service is absolutely satisfactory.  But yes -- it does get VERY crowded sometimes, particularly Friday and Saturday nights, and any night there is a big event going on in Lawrenceville.  On very busy nights, it is PACKED, and you may have to wait up to 1-2 hours for a table, depending on the size of your party.  They don't take reservations for tables under 5, so if you are planning to dine here on a Friday or Saturday night, plan to arrive much earlier than when you expect to eat.  They will call you when your table is about to be ready, so you can spend the waiting time browsing the many cute shops nearby or grabbing a cappuccino at Espresso a Mano.  Many of the negative reviews here seem to have been affected by the long wait and crowdedness/popularity of the restaurant.  Is the food worth the wait?  It's hard to say.  My advice is to either avoid trying to dine in during peak hours on Thurs, Fri, and Sat nights, or plan for the wait and do something fun in the neighborhood, or get takeout.  You won't be disappointed by the food!",

    "text": "Piccolo Forno is in my shortlist for favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's small, intimate atmosphere lacks the pretentiousness that one might expect at first glance, and the prices are very reasonable.  I've tried so many items on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Some of their dishes are almost too rich, but that's less of a complaint and more of an observation, as I've never left without feeling satisfied with my meal! If you want to guarantee yourself a great meal, get the lasagna. You'll be craving it again and again after the first bite. You simply can't beat homemade pastas, either.  Even as I sit here trying to think of one of my less memorable meals, I can't remember one. The pizzas are excellent, the salads are large and good (especially with their simple oil and vinegar dressing), and the appetizers always please the palate.  It's a perfect date night spot, as much as it's a perfect casual place to stop in for lunch or dinner. The wait can be rough during peak times, and reservations are typically only for larger groups (6 or more, if I remember correctly), but it's one of the few restaurants where I'm willing to suffer through a wait.  So, if you're looking for great Italian food, good service, and a nice BYOB place, be sure to make Piccolo Forno a priority!",

Super tough to get into, so recommend that you go early or later since they don't take reservations for parties less than 5. Evening rush started at 5:45 when we were there last Friday.   Recommend the lasagna and any of the wood-fired pizzas.

Pizzas are the perfect size for two people to split.   Also BYBO, which is always a plus!

Needless to say, I was excited when I found out that they had hand tossed pizza and hand made pasta. We arrived and only waited 15-20 minutes to be seating while I was eyeing every plate that I could. The aromas were amazing. The atmosphere was very laid back...oh, and I must mention that this restaurant is BYO! (A modest $5 corking fee). We brought our own wine!  Now, for the meal. The only difficulty is that they were out of butternut squash for the evening but that didn't matter because literally everything sounded amazing. We opted for the margherita pizza with prosciutto and basil to start and a basic salad. Both were unbelievable. Now, this isn't your average pizza. This is definitely a treat. Then we ordered our pasta. We opted for the spinach-filled ravioli and the roasted eggplant rigatoni. These were absolutely divine!!! The portions were hefty and the flavors were still on my tongue when I woke up. It was that good. I would make this a must for anyone visiting the area!",

Ahem, pizza's good but not that good, and anyway the kitchen closes at 11:00pm. The nice host was always appropriately saddened to give me the news.  But on Wednesday, at my 5th attempt, I got a table. So folks go there on wednesday.  We had two pizzas: 4 cheese and ham/mushrooms etc. The second pizza was very tasty, the 4 cheese one just good (one of the cheeses was a bit too sweet). Overall, it was a very enjoyable dinner. The tiramisu was excellent, surprisingly light.   The menu includes some antipasti (we did not try any but they looked good on our neighbors' tables) pizzas and pastas. Fairly simple menu. nothing fancy.  The waiter was also very nice this evening. And it's byob so it's appropriately nice with your wallet.   I am not sure I'll be back soon, but if I happen to crave for a pizza and if it's early in the week I'll eat there again.",

I used to work for a guy who was straight from Italy and his food, to this day, is the best Italian food I've ever had, but PF comes pretty close. Fresh homemade pasta. Excellent gravy. Really good meatballs, although I would of liked some red gravy to go with the meatballs, the pesto that accompanied them was quite delightful. I will absolutely be back. Next time I'm trying the pizza. Looked nice and thin for those of us who love a nice thin crust.",

    "text": "Want to come back here to try the pizza, as their oven did not look like a joke. But I thought the pasta was ludicrously heavy-handed.  House made fresh pasta. Nearly impossible to go wrong when that's your starting point. It doesn't need all that much else. Decent olive oil, a fresh herb or two, non-Velveeta cheese....there's just no reason to go throwing the entire cabinet at it. It's hard to argue with a more focused approach, unless you are on a higher plane of cooking sentience (and if you are, by all means go nuts!)  The cavatelli was a red pepper bomb.......herb-blanketed anarchy. The canelloni was so creamy, so remorselessly decadent that I found myself craving some Olive Garden fettuccine alfredo to lighten the meal (that said, the very first bite was pretty god damned good). But if you brush all the stuff off from both dishes you're left with some nice fresh pasta, cooked well and showcasing impeccable texture. So for that reason alone this place doesn't fall into stay-far-away territory.",

I get the lasagna and insalata mista every time and it is amazing every time. I've also had their pizza and some of their other pastas and they were delicious too. You really can't go wrong food wise.   They are BYOB, which is nice. But they do charge a $6 per bottle corkage fee, which is high in my opinion. Dear Piccolo Forno, you're great but please lower this to $3 or $4 like most restaurants.   They only take reservations for large parties so you'll need to plan ahead time wise when you go.   I highly highly recommend this restaurant!",

I love the fact that it's  BYOB (despite the small corkage fee of $6) and that it's a small neighborhood restaurant in the heart of Butler St, Lawrenceville. Their main courses are primarily focused on pizza and pasta, so I try to get one of each. Their pasta is always well cooked with fresh ingredients and the pizza is a classic Neopolitan pizza, often with an interesting mixtures of cheeses that I haven't commonly encountered in many pizza restaurants. An order of one pasta and one pizza was more than enough food for two people. While the first visit was near perfect, the second visit had some small mishaps in the service and food that made me downgrade this review to 4 stars.   The papparedelle we ordered was slightly overcooked and the pieces of rabbit meat were a bit sparse (which I guess is a common theme amongst all pasta dishes containing rabbit). The pizza came out a little later than the pasta, and it turned out the pizza was not the correct one. They corrected it, but we were done with the pasta before the correct pizza came out sometime later. When the pizza did come out, one half of the second pizza was a bit too burnt. The complimentary bread didn't come out all, so we had to ask the waiter for it while we were hungrily waiting for the right pizza to arrive. Despite these errs, the pizza tasted great and the waiter was very kind and accomdating, so I will definitely be back soon.",

If you like thin crust pizza, this place has great options, comparable to what you'd find in Italy!  It gets pretty packed around prime meal times on Fridays and the weekend, so I'd suggest coming early or making a reservation.   The prices are also pretty reasonable, about $15-17 for any pizza or pasta, but I think the pizzas are more worth your money.  Ambiance is very comfortable. You can dress nicely for a date night or casually and no one will judge you.   Also, this place is BYO!",

With its BYOB feature, you're able to bring your own wine and they cork it for you (for a fee), but since i'm super picky about wine, this allows me to not spend money on wine I won't like!   Their food is fantastic. I'm pretty sure it's a seasonal menu because I've gone and the menu has changed. Their spinach ravioli is one of my favorite meals in Pittsburgh -- and don't forget to try their pizza!   The atmosphere is super cool, but it can be cramped and a little loud so be aware of that. It also gets packed really easily so there may be a wait time/line for you to get seated. But I do assure you, the food is worth it. It's not too pricy either! For the quality of food, I'd pay it over and over again.   Will return soon!",

The BYOB aspect makes this place appealing. As far as service goes, the staff is great. Very friendly, accommodating, and they know their way around the menu.  I'd say my issue came with the food. The Tortelli was fine. The pasta was perfectly cooked, but was lacking flavor. (Not pictured) We also ordered Salsiccia E Cipolle. I've had this pizza in a few places in some other cities. Piccolo's version was overly salty. Not the normal saltiness of a pizza with smoked meat, but this was next level.",

Amazing dinner on a friday with great selection if pizza and pasta. I was particularly fond of the pizza over the pasta. The pizza are made eith a thin crust like in Italy and have great combination or make your own. I recommend the prosciutto pizza with arugula.. delicious!! I did think the lamb braised tagliatelle was unique because it has a zesty kick. If youre going for the traditional italian this may add flavor to your taste buds. I think the downside was the place was busy so we waited a little bit for service and to get a waitress which is understandable. I definitely recommend the tiramisu, it is homemade and very creamy. Personally, I wanted more options on the menu to choose from but I definitely am fond of the taste and will be back for sure!",

Our server was absolutely amazing and the food was even better. Our table got the margarita pizza, 2 different vegetarian paninis and the spinach ravioli. We ended up just sharing everything because it was all too good not to.   The margarita was probably the best margarita pizza I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The sauce was so bright, fresh and flavorful and the cheese and creamy and delicious. The freshly grated cheese and hot pepper flakes made it even better.   The unique flavor combinations of each panini were perfectly balanced. Nothing was overly greasy and everything just seemed well thought out and well prepared. It was also presented beautifully. I was shocked that the paninis were so reasonably priced ($10 for a large panini and a bean and quinoa salad, $13 for the pizza) especially given the quality.   Our waiter was fabulous and steered us the right way with food recommendations.   It was the perfect meal for an awesome day!",

We had intended to eat at another local spot, but that fell through and the smells wafting outside Piccolo Forno as we walked by convinced us to put our names in on the waitlist.  After a brisk walk up and down Butler Street, our number was called and we were in!  An outside table had just opened up and with a clear sky above and the moon shining we took our seats.  We shared a bunch of dishes (probably too many, but we could not help ourselves).  We started with an insalata mista, then on to a quattro stagioni pizza, lasagna toscana and ravioli con burro e salvia.  While we waited, a basket of fresh bread arrived and we dug in.  The mixed green salad arrived; it had shaved veggies and cheese on top and a light dressing.  All three entrees came out simultaneously (at our request).  The ravioli con burro e salvia was really enjoyed by the girls (less so by me, but only because I did not care for the combination of spinach and sage butter).  The lasagna toscana was deep, rich and hearty..but not overly saucy.  The star of the meal however, was the pizza.  The quattro stagioni pizza had four \"zones\" each with a different topping and flavor profile. I am a huge fan of artichoke hearts on a pizza so naturally that was my fav.  the charred crust was perfect and the sauce and cheese choices were spot on.  De-friggin'-lish!  For whatever reason, the girls were not fully satisfied with the bounty we had just been presented...so we topped off the meal with a shared slice of tiramisu.  It was an unusual presentation of flavors compared to a \"traditional\" version, but in the end there was nary a crumb left.  Great night, fun company and some delicious food under the stars.  Perfect.",

    "text": "BYOB Italian with an extensive menu right on Butler Street. We were intending to have dinner at Driftwood but it was closed for the holidays and as we had our minds set on pizza we decided to give Piccolo Forno a try. There was a 15/20 minute wait for a table and they took our number to call us when it was ready which gave us just the right amount of time to wander up to Good Wines and back where we grabbed a bottle to go with our dinner. (The meeter and greeter suggested that we go to the bar they own next door, Grapperia, and buy wine there. Nice try! Sure you could do that in a pinch surely the whole point of BYOB means that you aren't paying restaurant mark ups for your wine?) The room is pleasant, with fairly basic furnishings and decor, it's definitely not a hipster restaurant. It was busy and bustling, with a wide range of customers. The servers were accommodating and we didn't have to wait long for our food.  We shared an antipasto plate which came with a small bread basket, it was beautifully presented and the salamis and cheese were delicious as was the pickled giardinera vegetables that were served alongside. We ordered two different pizzas which were generously sized for a personal pie, although they wouldn't have been big enough for two people to share. The thin crust dough was good and the toppings were flavorsome but there was a little too much topping on the pies I felt.  Our bill was reasonable and we were pleased with our dinner. I'd revisit but I did find the way that they pushed their bar as the place to purchase your drinks was a little rude...",

I will admit that I should've done my research, seen that they are BYOB, and brought a bottle of wine with me. However, that did not take away from my dining experience. As an appetizer, I had the Polpette Toscane, simply put- meatballs. They were absolutely amazing, by far the best meatballs I've ever had. A part of me regrets sharing with my friend. As for entrees, we had the Pappardelle con Coniglio e Funghi (rabbit with pappardelle pasta) and Lasagna Toscana. I wish there was a bit more rabbit in my pasta, but overall it was really really good. The lasagna blew me away- you can tell that they used the best ingredients, it was truly delicious. I went to Italy last year and I have become pretty picky about Italian food since; Piccolo Forno is the real deal.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to frequent in Lawrenceville and Pittsburgh. Piccolo Forno was one of the first restaurants to open doors as part of a revitalized Lawrenceville and has a great location on Butler St. The Grapperia is a great place to get a drink beforehand if you have to wait for a table (only parties 5 or larger take reservations) and the restaurant is BYOB making it one of the best tasting and best for your wallet type options. Everything is very good, but the pesto here is exceptional. If you want a pizza, I'd go with the pesto pizza. The lasagna is the staple and has a nice and surprising nutmeg taste which goes good with the meat/cheese. The pasta with the braised lamb, orange zest and kalamata olives is another great choice. The waits can be long but are worth it",

I love the intimate atmosphere and that you can watch them make the pizzas.    The BEST part (besides the amazing food) is that its BYOB.  The prices on the food are overall reasonable but I love that I can save even more money by bringing my own wine.  Instead of spending money on a $12 glass of wine, I can have my own wine and get an extra appetizer, or two, or maybe also a pizza, or maybe also another entree to \"split\" with my fiance.    Anyways, the food is that good and I definitely recommend.",

First, the noise level is very loud. We were screaming at each other to be heard.   Second, the food was good, not great. I wasn't extremely impressed with the tagliolini. I also tried my friend's pizza, and the crust was soggy. Wood fired pizza soggy?   Third, where was the bread? I'm not a carb crazed person, but this was the first Italian restaurant I've been to that didn't serve bread.   The prices were very reasonable, and for that, I am grateful. The more BYOB restaurants in town, the better I say.  Service was to the point.",

Estimated wait was 1 hour on a Saturday night (around 6:30pm), actual wait ended up being 1 hour and 45 minutes. Ambiance was okay. It was  loud, and I felt like I was yelling at my dining companions all night.   I would probably come back, on a weeknight when it is less busy.",

I'm a lover of Italian food, but sometimes pasta dishes can get monotonous. Well this place has turned Italian good on its head and has some of the most creative and delectable dishes. We decided to get a couple pizzas and a few pasta dishes and do tapas style so we could all taste a variety. Get the lasagna- it was the best I've ever had and unlike any I've had. My table also loved the mint risotto special (I'm not a mint fan), and we also got the mushroom tagliatelle which was good. Honestly, anything you get here will be great but go for the lasagna as a must.",

The salads are also massive.  If you are looking for a side salad, you are out of luck.  Ask your date to split it or you won't have room for your meal.  I follow up this healthy start with the Dream Bomba.  Gelato in a chocolate candy coated shell with peanut butter and a caramel center????   Who could resist topping their meal off with that?    I also recommend their pizzas and the homemade risotto which is creamy and delicious.  It's not a huge place so at dinner time and particularly weekends, be prepared for a long wait (and not in the restaurant because there isn't much standing room.)",

    "text": "This is the only place I have ever eaten in the U.S. where the food actually tastes like it does in Italy. ESPECIALLY if you get anything that's a ragu or bolognese style sauce.  This may be my favorite restaurant in the Burgh. If nothing else, it's at least my favorite Italian restaurant.   I've had half a dozen or so pasta dishes off the menu as well as a handful of their pizzas and appetizers. The only thing I've ever ordered that I was unhappy with was a fairly loaded down pizza that included a fried egg. The center five inches or so of my crust wasn't really done, though under the weight of all those toppings, I understand. Every other pizza I've had has been perfectly made.  The pastas are all from scratch, as are the sauces and they have a depth of flavor that is simply head and shoulders above anything else you will find in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is lovely, though tightly packed. Get here early on a weekend night for dinner or be prepared to wait an hour or two. (Totally worth it, so head across the street to the Cantina or down a block to the coffee shop while you wait, they'll call your cell when your table is up.)  Extra bonus, this place is BYOB. We love to come here with friends and bring a few bottles of our favorite wines from home. This cuts the cost of a night out dramatically and by bringing a bottle of our favorite wine, you can pretty easily escape this place for around $50-75/couple with salad, entree and a shared dessert. Amazing pricing for the quality of what it is.  Close your eyes and point at the menu and order whatever it lands on. You won't be sorry!",

It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and quick  We really enjoyed the food. We started with the Affettati appetizer. The meats and cheeses were delicious. My boyfriend had the Cannelloni di Carne, which was really good. The walnut beschamel was delicious. I had the Rotolo Trecolori, which was a beautiful dish. I ordered it primarily because I was so interested in the appearance after looking at reviews online but it was completely worth it. The light crepe and vegetables paired so well with the rich gruyere sauce. Even the leftovers the next day were good.   We also got dessert, the bomba (caramel center in peanut butter gelato all covered in chocolate) and chocolate gelato. My boyfriend is not a huge dessert person and raved about the bomba. I thought the chocolate gelato with hazelhuts was very good too.   I thought the restaurant was really cute. I liked the oven being visible in the back. I wish they took reservations because I'd love to know I'd get a table quickly, especially with winter coming but it was good to know you can get seated quickly during the week. I definitely want to try the pizza next time.",

I've eaten here probably about 20x in the past few years, I even has my bachelorette dinner here and enjoyed it every time.   However, yesterday I went for lunch with my 5 month old and my friend with her child. The restaurant wasn't full, in fact it only had one other table occupied with another mom and her toddler. My waitress seemed annoyed that I was there. She slammed drinks on the table, curt responses and a general unpleasant feeling. I can handle all that, but what really pisses me off is when I turned discretely away from the dinning room, draped a blanket over myself and child to nurse her she made appalled faces. Come on people! I'm not having sex on a table, I'm feeding my daughter!!!   Not sure if I'll return which makes me sad because I really do enjoy the food and atmosphere and it's a shame that this waitress made me feel unwelcome.

    "text": "Rustic Italian food at its very best!   There is a very good reason Piccolo Forno remains a regular in Pittsburgh's Best Restaurant list.    The food was simple yet incredibly flavorsome! To start, we ordered three appetizers to share. The best was the Polpete Toscane (three baked beef/pork meatballs with a fresh herb green sauce). The fresh sauce helped cut through the richness of the meatballs which simply dissolved in your mouth. We then ordered mains and I selected the Agnolotti di Piselli pasta. It was absolutely delicious!! The sweet pea filling in the angnolotti was contrasted cleverly with salty pancetta and woody earthiness of wild mushrooms. It was a remarkable combination that I did not expect. We circled our mains around the table and everything was really enjoyable. Of mention is that they make both their  pasta and pizza dough in-house and, boy, does it make a difference! We ended the meal with Tiramasu and Lemoncello Gelato e Sorbetto. The Tiramisu had the surprising but delicious inclusion of orange liquor. We devoured it within seconds! It is a definite must if you still have the tiniest modicum of room left. Finally, the feast was ended with the Limoncello gelato which was a perfect cleansing finish to a very decadent meal.  We made reservations for 5 at 6.30 pm but arrived a little sporadically as it coincided with the middle of a torrential downpour. They were kind enough to alter their policy and seat us as we arrived. Our waitress was very attentive and had a great grasp of the menu as she had tried nearly every dish on the menu (speaks for itself!).   We all thoroughly enjoyed Piccolo Forno and departed with content bellies. I can't wait to come back and make my through the rest of this incredible menu!   Overview: Appetizers -- Crostini di Polenta, Polpete Toscane, Affettati Salad -- Fagioli Tonno e Cipolle salad, Antipasto di Mare salad Mains -- Prosciutto e Funghi pizza, Lasagna Toscana, Spaghetti di Casa con Gamberi e Cozze pasta, Rotolo Trecolori pasta,  Agnolotti di Piselli pasta Dessert -- Tiramisu, Limoncello Gelato e Sorbetto Drinks -- BYOB, $5 corkage per bottle   Bookings -- 5 or more, all must be present before being seated Price -- Great value for quality and portions. Pasta $15-19, Pizza $11-15 , Salad $ 8-11 Service -- exceptionally attentive and very helpful",

There is a open cooking area with a wood-fired pizza oven in the back though I believe the main kitchen is in the basement.  The seating area is modern and a nice balance of casual but classy.  Drinks: BYOB! Yay!!!  Food: I love the food here.  They have a plethora of fresh, seasonally inspired ,pasta dishes.  I have tried several, usually an option with seafood, and have never been disappointed.  Also, their pizzas are amazing.  I have usually gone with one of the prosciutto pizzas put also recently enjoyed the pistachio and mortadella pizza.  Service: During each visit we have always had attentive, knowledgeable service.  Overall: Piccolo Forno is my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh as it offers a wonderful combination of great ambiance, delicious food, good service, and reasonable prices.  Tip: I like stopping by Arsenal Cider right up the hill on 39th street to get a growler of cider to bring to dinner.  Also, they typically have a long wait on Friday or Saturday nights so be sure to have someone put your name in early or be prepared for a wait.  Fortunately there are several good bars to sit at nearby including Piccolo Forno's new offering \"Grapperia\" located right around the side on 38th street.",

She managed to convince us within the first 10 seconds that she rather be anywhere else but there. I have seen miserable waitresses before but nothing like this one. She seemed annoyed by any question or request. It seriously made me want to leave. But I really like their pizza, so I stayed and battled through her crappy attitude. Next time if she's still there I'll make sure to ask to be seated in someone else's section. She charged us corkage fee for a beer but didn't open it nor offered a glass for it. She has short hair and wears glasses in case you wonder; I don't remember her name. Maybe the owner decides to clean up his closet b/c customer service does matter. Or at least tell the stuff that smiling and being nice is mandatory. If this was my place I would be furious to know that my stuff is disrespectful to customers.",

The noise factor definitely put a end to most normal conversation.  Add to this the fact that we were seated directly behind  the hostess stand and practically in another table's lap.  I could have taken names for reservations as well read the texts on the the other table's Iphone!  Food was good-Marinated&Roasted Veggies which were good.  My date and I split the Quattro Stagioni.  Different toppings-artichokes, mushrooms, prosciutto and roasted red peppers-pleased different tastes.  I'm generally easy to please when it comes to pizza and I really enjoy wood-fired pies.  So I was happy with our pizza and meal in general. However, the noise and lack of room made the evening hard to enjoy.  Our server was good but when he got a larger party he disappeared.  Leaving us with  our teeny table too crowded with plates and our drink glasses empty.   Somewhat aggravating evening as far as trying to relax with good food.  Maybe give Piccolo another whirl.... ugh...note when searching the website you might need to hit the mute button!",

The servers are friendly, the hostesses are not.....maybe Bc too many people come and dump their names and expect to be seated soon, but they could be a little more respectful. Went for a birthday party with 7 people so we ordered quite a bit off the menu. The antipasto plate was solid except they could have included some better cheese. At the boar pasta w a ragu sauce which was pretty hearty meal except a little bland. Had to use some ground red pepper flakes and salt to get some better flavor. Also I had a couple of slices of the mortadella pistachio pizza which was hands down the BEST part of the meal, absolutely delicious and a must try. For dessert we split all options, but the cappuccino Tartufo was the best. Overall another solid experience. Their pasta dishes could be more flavorful in terms of spice but they make up for it with their pizzas.",

    "text": "Sometimes Pittsburgh feels like a food/cultural wasteland to me, and then I find places like this. I've recently been trying to explore the local Lawrenceville eateries and get out of the same old Oakland/Shadyside/Sq. Hill venues and it's definitely been a good thing. This is by far the best Italian food I've had in the burgh. In fact, I went to Joe Mama's for late night a few days after eating here and everything just paled/felt lame in comparison. Piccolo is first of all, one of the cleanest restaurants I've been in in the city. Second of all, it's relatively priced ($11-$15 for pasta entrees, $11-$13 for pizza), and third of all, the pasta is amazing! At least the dish that I had was. I'm still having dreams about it. I forget the name but it's basically a cheese gruyere pasta with the softest meltiest eggplant at the bottom. Never enjoyed something entirely vegetarian so much. I also loved the small, cozy and intimate atmosphere (okay it would have been intimate sans the drunk part of 8 right behind us. this definitely seems more like a date place than a group of friends, and on that note, it is also byob). Tucked away in that busy little building with people eating outside, it felt almost reminiscent of eating at a local east village restaurant.  Also, while you're waiting for a table be sure to check out the numerous boutiques down the street such as the newly opened PageBoy salon/store.",

Lets start with the pizza was very good and the fact that you can bring your own wine for $5 is wonderful. But the downsides are the wait was excessive, 45 minutes. Also they do accept reservations, contrary to Yelp description and our looking at empty tables waiting for the reservations to come in. Our waitress was overwhelmed and kept on forgetting to bring us the staple items, like bread and cheese, but I do not blame her. The pasta dishes were OK not great. We had the cavatelli dish and the ravioli with salmon, again both were just ok, actually slightly salty. Dessert was very good. Thus overall three stars.",

    "text": "While I cannot comment on the food, I must say that I have never been so insulted by an establishment in my entire life.    I was extremely excited to go to Piccolo Forno for my birthday as I have had my eye on it for several years, but just haven't seemed to be able to find the opportunity.  I will admit that the decision was made a bit last minute, so I wasn't surprised when they said that they were booked for reservations.  They did say that I could come in and put my name down on the list and wait, so I opted to do that and head over to Round Corner Cantina for a couple drinks and appetizers.  When I first arrived at 7:15, they had previously estimated that the wait would be about 2 hours, and I appreciated it when they gave me a call at around 9pm to let me know it would be another 45 minutes and to find out if I still wanted to wait.  I told them very clearly that I would still like to wait, as my party seemed relatively content at the time.  About an hour later, when we went over to check to see how much longer it would be, the hostess informed us that someone had called and said to cancel the reservation sometime after they had called me to confirm I would still like to wait.  Huh?  I told the hostess that there was no way this had happened as everyone in my party was still waiting.  She flatly told me that there was nothing they could do and that the reservation had been canceled.  One of the other hostesses started looking around the restaurant, trying to figure out if there was any way to fit my group in, but the original hostess shot her down and said there was no way we could possibly get seated (it was already past 10pm by this time).  There was no apology or anything, and I left extremely upset.    I am not certain if it was another patron looking to get a seat sooner that called, or if one of the employees was looking to get home earlier and didn't want to deal with a group of 8 at a relatively late hour.  Regardless, I was extremely insulted that they did nothing to try to remedy the fact that we had been waiting for a table for over 3 hours.  We ended up having to go to a bar in order to get food since it was already too late for most restaurants, and it pretty much ruined everybody's night since we all were so hungry and grumpy.  While I was looking extremely forward to trying Piccolo Forno since I had heard so many great things about their food, I will never patronize the restaurant due to the rude and insulting customer service.",

And the toppings are so fresh and first-rate. Nice service and very reasonable. And where else in the US can you have pizza this good and walk down the street to have espresso as good as they make at espresso a mano? A small slice of Italy in Lawrenceville!",

We ordered the Margarita pizza for our six year old and it was very good. We devoured it. I had the Crespelle di Funghi which was very good but rich - the waiter warned me. Portions are large - I could only finish about a third of this dish. The BF had the braised rabbit pasta on the waiter's recommendation. The pasta was clearly homemade - very tender and cooked perfectly. The sauce was fabulous. We didn't order any of the salads but I wish we had - they were huge and looked and smelled delicious. We went there on a Saturday night around 9 and it was busy and very loud inside. Outside was much quieter. I would highly recommend this restaurant for great Italian food in Pittsburgh.",

Their desserts are a bit gluttonous and, while I'm not a huge fan, once again, my family is.  Piccolo Forno seems to fit the mold of that restaurant you take the easily impressed. It's lighter on the wallet than some of the better restaurants in the city, but unique enough that your company feels like they're getting an experience.  The service is just okay.

    "text": "I haven't been to Piccolo Forno in a long time mostly because I know that it's always packed and they don't take reservations unless you have a party of 6 or more, however the food is definitely worth the wait.  On my most recent visit I went to dinner there with a friend around 8:45 PM assuming that it wouldn't be crowded, but the place was packed to capacity and we had to put our name on the list for a table (it took about 20 minutes).  I ordered the Tagliatelle con Ragu di Agnello which is braised lamb with olives on spinach tagliatelle topped with orange zest and grated cacio cavallo.  The pasta was so fresh and delicious that you could actually taste the flour - I know that might sound odd, but I mean it in the absolutely best way - you could tell by the smell, texture, flavor of the Tagliatelle that it had just been made - it hadn't been sitting around and wasn't stale of overcooked - it was absolute perfection!  The orange zest added an interesting brightness to the dish, though I found it a little overpowering but overall the dish was delicious - the lamb was braised just right and was melt in your mouth tender and the olives were just the right amount of salt to give a depth and earthiness to the dish.  My friend ordered one of the hand-tosses pizze - the Quattro Stagioni which came with 4 different toppings (sectioned off) and she said that she could tell that the pizze dough was handmade that the toppings were all fresh and quality ingredients.  My only complaint is similar to what some other people have posted which is that the hostess was not pleasant at all.  She seemed exasperated that I wanted to put our names on the list and really seem to dislike her job, and unfortunately, our waitress wasn't much friendlier.  I'm sure this is just because the place is so busy and it's obviously stressful when there is no downtime for them but it's unfortunately part of their job to deal with customers and it seems to me that it should be a GOOD thing that the restaurant is so busy because that means job security.  I will definitely go back again, but I might try to go during an \"off\" time when I have a day off during the week, that's not also a holiday so that maybe they will be a little less crazy and I can enjoy the atmosphere without feeling rushed and cramped in.",

BYOB is a major perk but the wait (2 1/2 hours on a Saturday) can be a little trying... However we didn't have reservations, so I guess that's expected, and enjoyed some beer and chips at the cantina.  I still prefer Ill pizzaiolo in mt lebanon but this is a good second.",

    "text": "So I liked Piccolo Forno.  I really did.  Very tasty.  But I haven't quite figured out why people are willing to wait 90 minutes for it.  Puzzling mystery.  We knew this would happen, so we put our names in around 630 pm on a Saturday, and got seated about 8 pm.  Fortunately we had enjoyed several cocktails at Eclipse Lounge down the street in the meantime, so we were in very good spirits.  Also, the hosts take your cell phone number, and even gave us a courtesy call when the party whose table we were going to take was \"eating dessert,\" so we knew we had about 15 minutes left to wait and had time to finish our cocktails without needed to chug them and run out the door.  Piccolo Forno is small and bustling.  People gather to wait in the front, so it can be a little crowded getting in the door.  Once seated though, we all felt relaxed and happy.  We opened a few bottles of wine ($5 each corkage), and I have to say much as I love BYOB, I hate this corkage fee thing.  Ugh.  Maybe I'm just spoiled, but in other cities where I've lived, BYOB = no charge.  So, I got a house salad which was a nice, simple starter, and then at the server's recommendation, I ordered the Stracotto di Cingiale con Fettucine.  That would be braised boar with vegetables over fettucine pasta.  It was quite yummy.  Obviously fresh pasta, tender meat, and a reasonably generous portion for not much money.  The boar was seasoned in an interesting way, almost a bit sweet - sugar?  cinnamon?  not sure.  But tasty.  Couldn't finish it so it went in a box, and I look forward to consuming the rest of it shortly, probably tonight.  Gratuity was included since we had a party of 7 - two girls split the check, and then we gave them cash.  But I've since heard from the two girls that the restaurant overcharged them - randomly adding $15 more to each check, even though gratuity was already included (clearly stated on the receipt) and we can't figure out why they did that.  They're planning to call and get that figured out, but it put a bit of a damper on our impressions of the evening.  So it's a tasty place with good, fresh food.  But to be truly honest, when you have to wait 90 minutes and pay to BYOB, and the check gets messed up, it isn't exactly a perfect evening out.  So if you don't mind waiting and paying to bring wine, I'd say go for it.  But the food didn't knock my socks off enough to make up for the logistical annoyances.  If I'm waiting and paying for my own wine, I'd like the food to be outstanding.  And we aren't quite there, in my opinion.",

    "text": "As a native New Yorker, I don't think I'm a pizza snob, but I am pretty knowledgeable; and Piccolo Forno's pizzas are among the best I've ever had anywhere. Very thin crusts, imaginative toppings, especially the excellent eggplant.  I notice some of the other Yelpers have complained about long waits on popular nights. Well, if a small restaurant has tremendous food, long waits on Friday or Saturday nights are inevitable. We went at 5 pm on Tuesday night...were going to a Pirates game at 7 pm...and were seated and served quickly.   In a way, Piccolo Forno patrons have the same problem as Pirates fans: Used to be you could walk up to the ticket window 10 minutes before game time and get great seats twenty rows behind home plate. Now you're lucky to get seats a hundred feet above the left fielder.  Produce a great product and more customers show up.",

    "text": "For a quick trip down memory lane, this is the FIRST restaurant that my fiance and I ever went to in Pittsburgh, this was about two months ago.  We had driven 2,600 miles across the country and wanted wood fired pizza, so a bit of Yelp research landed us here.    We have been back a couple of times since our first visit.  Honestly, I really like, (bordering love) this restaurant, it is BYOB so be forewarned.  The vibe is always bright and cheery, and the atmosphere is popping, always busy and fun to people-watch.    I LOVE the Speck pizza, the mascarpone cheese does it to me every time.  The last time we went we also tried a mushroom pasta, and honestly it was just kind-of meh.  The mushrooms tasted like they were canned, and the flavor was kinda bland.  The salads are HUGE though, definitely enough for 2-4 people, and our was really fresh and delicious.  Also, because we rarely make a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, typically the wait is between 1-1.5 hours.  Don't be discouraged, there is an awesome little bar right across the street that you can wait at until you are called on your phone.  Pretty nice, huh?",

We had the pasta special, butternut squash ravioli. Very salty, not really edible. Butternut squash soup was very different from others; it was not cream based. There were a couple pieces of squash in a soup that was mostly kale. My appetizer, the sweet red peppers with breadcrumbs and Parmesan was superb! Tiramsu was outstanding, The waitress with a piercing in her nose was disgusting in a classy restaurant.....loose the piercing when you are serving others. And please do not take my used fork from my appetizer and put it on the table for later use......get me a new one!  Yuck!!!",

The server wasn't overly friendly but that was only the start of the problems. Two of us ordered the same thing, and the third and forth ordered different things.  The waitress returned to tell us that they were out of what the two of us ordered, and what else there were out of, which was about 6 other things. The sandwich I ordered came with a bean salad.  I passed on that.  My sandwich came cold and drowning in pesto.  She never returned to ask how things were so I didn't have the chance to send it back. When she came back to bring the checks we all had empty glasses.  At this point I let her know that it was cold. She didn't apologize or anything, just took my plate.  She ended up taking 20% off my check. Considering I ate half the sandwich and didn't get the bean salad, I figure she should have charged me only 20%.",

I look to Yelp to find cool places because who really wants to eat (and pay) at the hotel restaurant all the time. I came across this place and I must say its a great find. The food is good, pizza not as much of a crunch as I would like but still good. The place gets very busy but still holds its intimate feel. Yes, from some of the other reviews it gets a tad noisy but not something so bad you could not hear the person across from you. I would defiantly be back.",

    "text": "Several of my friends rave about this place.  My first attempt to eat there was before a Saturday night jazz concert.  The wait was two hours so we passed and ate at Luke Wholey's new place.    On a subsequent Friday night, we were able to be seat immediately.  I was a little taken aback by the size of the place.  It is tiny and thankfully, most diners appeared to have bathed that day, because you practically rub shoulders with other diners (strangers?).    My dining companion has dined here several times and is one of my friends who raves about the place.  But then again, she absolutely raves about any salad with walnuts.  But I digress, she recommended the salmon ravioli which I ordered along with the beef and pork meatballs as an appetizer, oh, as my antipasti choice.   The meatballs were delicious.  Easily could be made into an entree choice.  Disappointed that we had to ask for bread and what bread is offered is hard and not replenished.  I was disappointed with the salmon ravioli.  It was incredibly salty and I am usually a saltaholic who adds salt to practically everything.  The salty taste made it difficult to savor the taste of the salmon.    Would I go back?  Probably, I'm anxious to try their pasta, especially the lasagna.  I am a big seafood eater and I would like to see more seafood items on the menu.  As we left, waiting customers spilled onto the street and people were circling looking for a parking space.  We could barely exit the parking lot before someone swooped into our newly-vacant space.",

Better Italian food can be found in Pittsburgh, but reasonably priced entrees, coupled with BYOB, makes for a nice meal with friends on a reasonable budget. An appetizer and entree will run about $20 per person. Make sure to reserve a few days in advance; it's often hard to get a table if you walk in or call the day of your meal.

We started with the margarita pizza as an app. I highly recommend it. Not too filling and just enough to share (there was 4 of us) on to the main course we all had to try something different. I had the braised rabbit dish and it was the favorite at the table. We also had the squid ink dish and a braised lamb. All super good. However the highlight for me was the dessert. The cappuccino ice cream dish was hands down the greatest dessert ever. Could have ordered one more of those. The portion sizes were just right and the Service was amazing.

O.M.G.!!! i'd bathe in this stuff! a lot of bread puddings are dry. not this! it was so moist. the cool thing was that they froze the goat cheese in sticks! it went with the pudding so well. oh, & a glass of prosecco from the house! if you never go any other time, try to make sure you hear about the new year's eve menu at piccolo forno, & GO!",

Knowing there is a possibility of a wait, we've always hit Piccolo Forno a bit early and gotten seated immediately. Hope I haven't just sabotaged myself!  I learned in Italy that I should always order the spaghetti with shrimp and mussels (in Italy I got clams, too). I was definitely not disappointed doing this here! Although you may have to treat your shirt for red sauce stains, but if you brought red wine you might have that even if you ordered white sauce.  On another occasion we've also split the fennel salad (very tasty) and the Quattro Stagioni pizza with 4 separate ingredient sections with artichokes (also an Italian staple, yum!), prosciutto, mushrooms and roasted red peppers. This pizza was amazing. We ordered this same pizza at Pi Coal Fired and  Piccolo Forno blew it away!

    "text": "I really have mixed feelings about this place.   Maybe a 3.5, but there were some negatives that can't push it above that.    On one hand... - I would totally go back for the mortadella and pistachio pizza.    That was by far the winning dish.  The risotto was good, but way too heavy for me to really crave again.  The lemon cavatelli was great and fresh, though slightly too lemony for my taste.   - The portions were large.  Most of us could only finish half of what we ordered - hello leftovers!   - The service was good overall.    - l like the BYOB concept (though see below for a caveat here).    On the other... - It was SOOOOO hot and stuffy in there.  We were all sweating all the way through our meal.    - They don't take reservations except for large parties.  I just hate that in general.   It is compounded here by the fact that if you have to wait, there's no place to do it.  You have to stand outside or go somewhere else.    - Their corkage fees are ridiculous.  $5 per bottle no matter how many bottles you bring.  Charge me a buck for the wine glass and call it a day.   So annoying.    - The ground boar ragu was not my favorite.  If I'd ordered that, I've have been disappointed by the very gamey taste of the dish.    - Our party of 8 was sat at a table really meant for 6 - another peeve of mine.  It was pretty crowded overall and the people that sat along the aisle kept getting bumped by people headed to the bathroom.    Overall, we had fun and everyone enjoyed the meal.  But the negatives are kick this out of my go-to category.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I had extremely HIGH expectations for this place. I have heard great things from people, but today my expectations were dropped to the floor almost instantly.   We walked in and were seated immediately. I noticed that their menu items change due to pictures on Yelp from 8 months ago not being on their menu today. Our waitress took sometime to come to our table and when she did come over I sensed that she wasn't going to be the most personable waitress and boy was I right. She was pretty rude when it came to us asking questions about the menu. My mom asked if she could omit an ingredient from her meal and she was rude about and said no they can't do that. Why is it that big of a deal to leave something out? I asked if I could have cavatelli instead of cannelloni with my salsiccia e rapini that had sausage and rapini with red pepper beschamel and gruyere cheese. I know that it was a menu item a while back but instead of filling the cannelloni it had cavatelli noodles. That couldn't be done either. Something as easy and swapping out pastas, whatever. We waited a while for our meal to arrive and my mom received hers before I got mine because apparently the kitchen made the wrong thing. Figures. The waitress asked if we wanted bread in the mean time, shouldn't we have gotten bread from the get go? Not when our meals came out? The food was mediocre. My mom said her risotto was on the salty side. Another waitress had to come to our table to ask if we were finished because our waitress was behind the counter eating. She boxed our food up in the back and then never brought it back out for us...so we asked if we could have our food so we can leave. Overall, this was an unpleasant experience and it all stemmed from terrible service.",

    "text": "Piccolo Forno is a lovely venue with great food. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. It would be an ultimate date night location if only the wait wasn't so long. I kid you not...nearly 2-hour wait. If you want good food, you have to be willing to work for it! If possible, try to make a reservation, but I think there's a group minimum.   The food though was great! There's something on the menu for everyone. For those seeking something simple and light, I recommend the Margherita Pizza with extra basil on top. The crust was thin, almost like flat bread, but the freshness of the sauce and cheese was divine--probably the healthiest pizza I've ever devoured. It was decent size and can easily be shared between 2 people. For those seeking a little crunch, I highly recommend the Lucchese Panini, which comes with prosciutto, roasted peppers, mozzarella, pesto sauce and a side of beans. The combination of flavors and crunchy texture of the panini was on point. For those more adventurous, the Spaghetti Neri con Gamberi (spaghetti with squid ink) might be an option. It's definitely interesting with a hint of fishy and reminded me of the ocean--something Queen Ursula would whip up in her kitchen. I enjoyed the first bite of the squid ink pasta, but it's not something I'll be able to finish. End dinner with some tiramisu, meant to be shared because it's huge!   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Piccolo Forno. I am willing to return again in the future for another dining adventure here. The wait was pretty bad, but totally worth it for the experience!",

I had the Ravioli con Burro E Salvia. I thought it was absolutely delicous and the portion was perfect.   I would put them as priced right for what they offered. It's a nice place to meet with friends or to go on a date, not breaking the bank but with class.   I only gave them four stars because I felt like I was being rushed out at the end. There were people waiting at the door, but I wasn't quite finished and my waitress was grabbing to wrap my plate. She was very nice and helpful with options, I don't think I had bad service at all. I think it's just best to keep in mind that if you plan on going during rush hour you will wait. If you don't want to wait, go earlier or later.   Overall, enjoyed Piccolo Forno!",

I'd definitely recommend at dining during \"off\" hours.   Everything we had to eat was absolutely awesome, but the lasagna was my favorite!

    "text": "SETTING: Simple and intimate ambiance with a warm and inviting atmosphere. I really like the dark red tones, brick walls, and hardwood floors.   FOOD: Garfield would love this place because Piccolo Forno does lasagna like no other. I love lasagna and have had a wide spectrum of quality. I've had frozen dinner lasagna (regretfully), Olive Garden lasagna (pretty okay), and also lasagna from other nice Italian restaurants (not bad). BUT, Piccolo Forno's lasagna (have mercy!) is the clear winner here.   What makes this lasagana so incredible? No question, it's the beschamel cream sauce instead of the heavy ricotta cheese. The lasagna just melts in your mouth! Furthermore, the size of the dish is generous. It's always a struggle deciding if I should take the rest home and enjoy it for another meal, or enjoy it longer and finish the dish!   SERVICE:  Professional. However, PF always gets very busy, so sometimes it does get a bit difficult to flag down staff.  IMPRESSIONS:  I've had lasagna here for a few times, and I could never order anything else. That's how good it is. I just can't muster up the courage to try something new when I already know the lasagna is heavenly!",

Being the half-blooded carb-loving Italian that I am, I had heard great things about this place before finally checking it out a little over a year ago.  The first plus is that its BYOB. Sure, they charge a corkage fee ($5), but unlike most restaurants with a liquor license, you can have the wine/beer/liquor of your choice for a much smaller price.   The food... oh the food.  I highly recommend starting with the Affettati plate (meats and cheeses) to tide you over until the real games begin.  As for the main courses, my favorites are the salmon ravioli and the tagliatelle with mushroom ragu.  Even once you're stuffed beyond belief, you'll find room for juuuuust one more bite.  Their pizza is also phenomenal.  My favorite combo is pepperoni, basil and ricotta, but you'd be hard pressed to find something that DOESN'T taste good.  The only downside is that they don't take reservations for parties of less than 5, and they get rather busy in the evenings, especially on weekends. Be prepared to wait, but also to be pleasantly surprised once you make your way inside.  Worst case scenario, just pop open your bottle of wine to pass the time!  I've found the best time to go and not have a wait is on Tuesday or Wednesday evenings.  Each time I've gone on one of these nights, I've been seated immediately with my party of 2-3 people.  Buon appetito!",

Without a reservation I'd be very surprised that you could dine here on a Saturday night.  Every single table was taken and people walking in were told the wait was well over an hour.   Wait staff was great and they went to extra lengths and feats of strength to open our bottle of champagne.  I think they finally ended up opening it by brandishing a sword. Nevertheless, they were up for the challenge and bubblies were all around.  So yes, if you didn't sense from that description, they are BYOB.  And the cork fee is very reasonable. I had a delicious ravioli that left me very full.  Many at my table enjoyed their thin crust pizza, another had lasagna and was quite satisfied.  Prices are really reasonable, service is good, and Piccolo Forno is a great place to go with friends.  Just call ahead!",

Was the wait worth it?  Yes, but I was getting hangry...  As we snacked on our appetizers - Bruchetta and Affettati - my hangry side subsided and I was able to savor the delicious cured meats and creamy cheeses.  Okay maybe I'll give this place a fair shot.  Then our entrees arrived - Prosciutto e Funghi, Tortelli, Cavatelli con Salsiccia e Rapini, and my selection Agnolotti di Piselli - sweet pea filled agnolotti with pancetta and wild mushrooms.  TASTE EXPLOSION!  The bright green sweet pea filled agnolotti were the perfect complement to the savory mushrooms.  The crispy panchetta provided the textural and salty flavor needed to complete the dish.  Did I lick the plate?  No, but I was close.  Dessert?  Well sure, why not?  When in Rome... House made Tiramisu and other sorbetto arrived at our table... but didn't stay on the plate for long.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.  My only complaint is the wait time.  In most restaurants, hanging around after the bill is brought is fine.  However when people hanging out, not ordering additional items, and sipping on their BYOB - these patrons are costing you business.  There either need to be more tables or an increased sense of urgency to move tables.  We were told a 30 minute wait.  It turned out to be an hour because our 4 top table was taken by 2 diners who decided to chat for 30 minutes after their meal.  Yes it's a causal and intimate atmosphere, but these customers are costing you money.   The only thing preventing me from awarding Piccolo Forno from the coveted 5 stars is the wait time.  By the way - this is a BYOB establishment.",

    "text": "Four star pizza and service for sure! The pizza tastes very fresh and authentic. As someone who has had pizza snobbery ever since a trip to Italy several years ago, I have a special soft spot for a pizza that tastes truly Italian and I think they hit the nail on the head here. The service was friendly and attentive, though I did not like the fact that they will not seat until the whole party arrives, even with two people. The pasta was pretty good, I tried the Stracotto Di Cingiale Con Fettucine, but honestly I would say stick with the Pizze, that is definitely your best best. BYOB with a classic corking fee and not necessarily a great place for groups. Decent place to split a pizza with an attractive someone and a bottle of wine and call it a night.",

It is BYOB and this was evident at nearly every table. Our server was Charly... let me say this.... his upbeat personality, professionalism , knowledge of menu and charm elevated our dining experience . He loves what he does and it's evident, although twice he tried to toss some papers in the trash and twice missed, I guess that's why Pittsburgh  does not have an NBA team.  The pasta with mushrooms was excellent as was the pizza... the lasagna was tasty but did not seem as fresh as the other items.  Great ambiance , reasonable menu pricing and good food makes for a successful evening.",

We grabbed a drink across the street and they called us when our table was ready which First of all, I would prefer rather than waiting around and secondly, there is no where to wait.   All of the staff we spoke to were really friendly and helpful. I debated between two dishes and was glad I let out server help me choose, it was delicious! She highly recommended the Tortelli and we got a meat and cheese plate to start. Everything was filling and so good.   It was BYOB so make sure to take a nice bottle of wine with you.   I will say they cram as many tables in as possible. It is a small place and you don't get much room.  But other than that, this is a new favorite of mine.",

Anyway, it was all good because the waitress told me there is a bar right next door where I could walk over and get a couple of beers and bring them back. When I returned, she poured my first beer in a glass and stuck my second in the refrigerator. I thanked her and said that made the $3.00 corkage fee worthwhile, but she explained there is no corkage for the bar next door sine they own it. So that is great, but if they own the bar, why do I have to walk over and get my own drink? Weird... Anyway, I ordered the Insalata Di Rucola and Speck E Mascarpone pizza. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent. I will definitely return!",

Half our party started with an antipasto with meat, cheese, and a delightful addition of mustard seeds. The other half had an asparagus appetizer with burrata and pesto. Mmm to both. Tried the cannelloni, spinach ravioli in sage butter and tortellini in bolonaise. Tender homemade pasta with fresh ingredients that compliment rather than overwhelm.

    "text": "I noticed that when you first look at the reviews here you are inundated with positive. I'm writing this because I think that this restaurant is the most overrated place I have ever experienced, and this is mostly due to rave reviews that I read here. I understand that everyone has different tastes, however I disliked certain things here enough that I felt it was only fair that another view point was offered, and I wish that someone had talked me out of trying it.   Our service was fine (not exceptional, but fine - and honestly it seems that good help is hard to come by these days because I always thought that if you work in the service industry you go out of your way to be pleasant and accommodating, however this seems to be an outdated concept now almost everywhere). We arrived before the dinner rush so I have no complaints about a long wait and was surprised how quickly we were seated. I found the restaurant to be beautiful with a nice atmosphere.  I really, really hated the food. So did my boyfriend. This was our first time so we did try a variety of things. Someone did previously mention on here that the lasagna tasted like chef boyardee, BUT to be entirely spot on I have to add that it is chef boyardee with nutmeg. The only reason I could imagine someone liking this is if somehow subconsciously they are comforted and happy because it tastes like childhood. It is not, however, something I would expect to be served in a restaurant. The boyfriend echoes these thoughts, though he was also displeased with the texture.   I was super excited to try the mortadella and pistachio pizza! Now I did not realize that this is not a red sauce-based dish, and so if it does specify that on the menu then that expectation not being met is entirely on me, however I envisioned a regular pizza with bits of meat and pistachio on it. This was a very oily, pistachio-mixed-with-pesto-based pizza with a few chunks of mortadella. It was sweet. (I do not like sweet pizza.) I do happen to like pesto, and occasionally use it as a pasta sauce, however this was so drenched in the stuff that I did not finish a single slice. Boyfriend also ate only one slice, and neither of us could have been bribed into eating more, though I doubt anyone in the history of eating pizza has ever said that after just one piece.   We did order soup, which was decent. We also had the antipasto appetizer, which consists of cured meats, cheeses, pickled vegetables, and toasted bread. This was mostly decent, however I found the meats to be oily and one of the cheese selections was sliced provolone. I was expecting something a bit....more. Personally I think cheese plates should include either very delicious, rare, or unique cheeses, but this had none of those.   2 stars are given for the restaurant itself, being byob, and because there was nothing *wrong* with the service. .5 stars for the food. My overall perception is that people are giving more stars because they think they are *supposed* to like it. If offered the same food in a different environment I would wager we would not see the same reviews. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I just love Piccolo Forno so much, it warms my soul.   I've been here quite a few times over the years and have never had a bad experience whether it was just 2 people or large groups.  Yes there will be a wait, yes it will be long on weekends, but that is why you have 2+ great pre-dinner drinks options across the street and around the corner.  Just be prepared for the wait, get a drink at Cantina, take a deep breath it will all be ok and you will soon be drunk off a margarita and in lasagna heaven.  The food.  I always start with a Pizza.  The pizza is the best authentic Italian style in the city.  My mother lived in Italy for years and I've been a few times and this is the closest I have had to the streets of Italy.  My favorites: Prosciutto E Rucola or the Speck E Marscarpone.  Prosciutto and arugla is my life go to pizza, but the Speck and Marscarpone is a unique change.  Sweet from the cheese, salty from the speck, my mouth is watering.    Pasta.  Oh sweet homemade pasta.  I've had the rotolo which is very good.  The spinach ravioli with sage is also good.  Tortelli is good, but not my favorite.  Where my heart starts to race with excitement is the lasagna.  Many have said it before, but this lasagna is just IT.  Sidenote, I would like them to bring back the maccheroni with eggplant.  That was always my dining partners choice for ideal sharing.  Regardless of your party size, what people are ordering, one person must get the lasagna.",

Piccolo Forno is a BYOB type of restaurant, and they offer to open it for you, which is very nice. They have plenty of options on their menu such as pastas, pizzas, anti-pastas, and paninis. All are reasonably priced. The service is great, the food is amazing, and I would definitely recommend coming here if you want great quality food!",

    "text": "If there are down sides to the restaurant they are these...no reservations, and no wine menu.  The workarounds are relatively simple:  put your name on the list, then go next door to Grapperia to grab a cocktail or two while you wait, then bring a bottle next door when you return.  This worked really well for me, but did have the unforseen side effect of pigeon-holing me with a dish that would pair well with the wine I'd selected (it had a dragon on it that breathed fire, and the fire had \"burned away\" part of the label.  It was a Pinot Noir, which is a decent wine if you have to pick one, but if we're really being honest I picked it because of the label, which kicked ass.)  Next time around...and there will be a next time (the food was really good) I'll peruse the menu first, then whilst awaiting my callback...I'll pick a wine that pairs with that dish.  Because of the Pinot though (and also because it sounded good) I picked the  Pappardelle con Coniglio e Funghi...Braised rabbit with pappardelle pasta, roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms.  At $17, I thought the price point was really reasonable (I know pasta isn't generally super expensive, but I still thought it was sane).  It was earthy and had a nice balance of pepper to it.  Paired well with my flaming dragon wine (the name...I don't remember the name, but that dragon is burned indelibly into my mind like the label from the bottle).    Service was casual and well-informed, prompt and courteous.    Ambience was clean and casual, well-lit, cheerfully...Tuscan?  Someone who knows stuff will have to check that.  I thought of Tuscany.    Dessert was a very well executed Tiramisu.    A nice experience overall.",

We started off with the mussels, which were the best I've ever had. We got the smaller size and it was plenty for two of us. They were flavorfully prepared in a way that didn't overwhelm the taste of the mussels themselves. For dinner, I got a gnocchi dish that sounded amazing on paper but which in reality was underwhelming. The gnocchi themselves were good but the other ingredients tasted like they were randomly tossed in. The ingredients were good- just didn't really mesh together. Still giving 4 stars though because based on the mussels and the sounds of the other dishes, I have a feeling the gnocchi was a one-time miss",

This is a great place to do lunch on a weekday when you can lounge and linger and really enjoy your stay - the evenings can be noisy with brick walls and wooden floors.  I sat outside once and the traffic wasn't all that bad but we did have a gentleman stumble out of the Round Corner Cantina across the way who shouted \"F*** YOU\" very loudly and then mumbled apologies when he realized there were four tables of customers watching him.

I ordered a small house salad which was simple and delicious and my boyfriend ordered the fennel orange salad, which was a huge portion. And then for our entrees we ordered pizza - prosciutto with arugula and the quattro. The prosciutto was absolutely delicious but the quattro was soggy in the middle from the mushrooms, peppers and artichoke which was disappointing.

The spaghetti with seafood was almost under  al dente and bordered not cooked all the way .. And I LIKE my pasta al dente. The mushroom pasta dish is bland, and the eggplant appetizer also left something to be desired. Go for the pizza, but go elsewhere - maybe to Il Pizzialo for the fresh pasta.",

    "text": "I've only been here twice, but have had pleasant experiences both times.    I have had both the pizza and the pasta and I have to say...I enjoyed the pasta more than the pizza! The pizza is great, but the fresh pasta I had was even better.  I ordered the tagliatelle with mushrooms.  The best part about this dish is how it is unlike anything I've ever ordered.  I find that  when pasta and mushrooms are served a restaurant will cover the dish with some creamy sauce that adds nothing and takes away that great mushroom flavor.  Not here!  The dish didn't really have a sauce-the shrooms were probably cooked in wine, which gave the dish a great taste.  I could have eaten the entire thing if I didn't want to take part of it home and figure out if I could cook something similar myself!  We had the polenta appetizer, which was something great to split for a table of 5.     They have made some changes in the restaurant to deal with the noise, including adding these \"noise shields\" on the ceiling and wall.  It was definitely much quieter my second time there.  I had to take off one star for the same reason as many other reviewers: the front of the house/service.  We had a reservation for 5, and they let us sit down right away even though only 4 of us were there, which is uncommon here.  But, we were told we only had the table for 2 hours.  It would have been 9:30 by the time we left, and this was on a Wednesday night.  I know that some people like to linger in restaurants for all hours, but in a busy place like this I think the diners understand their table is in high demand.  The prices are reasonable, the corkage fee is $5.  Be prepared to wait some time for a table on a Friday or Saturday.",

    "text": "piccolo Forno is an Tuscan style-Italian restaurant on Butler Street in Lawrenceville which is only minutes from the Strip District and downtown Pittsburgh.  In the last few years, Lawrenceville has steadily worked on dusting itself off and dragging itself up from the tired run down town it was in years past.  There are now shops, cafes and restaurants and they are starting to outnumber the empty buildings.  I chose this restaurant on a blind whim from a list of restaurants and I was well rewarded for it. piccolo Forno,which means 'Small Oven,' is small and intimate but a large corner is devoted to it's namesake.  The piccolo forno is tucked in the back right corner where it's plied by chefs wielding long handled wooden peels to whisk pizzas in and out of the oven.  The walls are exposed brick with a golden yellow back wall that matches the wooden chairs snugged cosily around the tables.  When the tables are full it can get a little loud but the blended voices of other diners actually helps to create a sense of privacy around one's table.  It's common in restaurants around here to be provided with a basket of bread before the meal comes but not in piccolo Forno.  Here, they ask if you would like bread with your dinner and if you are amenable it is brought out only a minute before the entrees arrive.  It's possible that some would be put off by this as it's not the expected thing but it is very nice not to fill up on bread beforehand.  piccolo Forno has many things on the menu to choose from: salads, panini, pizzas and pastas.  Rick had the Tagliatelle con Sugo di Funghi  (Tagliatelle Pasta with a Mushroom Sauce).  I only had one bite of his but it was creamy with the earthy taste of mushrooms almost! but not quite overwhelming the pasta.  I chose to try something entirely new to me and even Rick was surprised and questioned my choice: Stracotto di Cinghiale con Fettucine--Braised boar with vegetables and fettucine pasta.  Many of the Italian cookbooks I've read usually have one or more recipes with wild boar and I've been curious ever since.  The meat was tender and the flavorful sauce coated the fettucine and vegetables with a slightly sweet taste that I couldn't identify.  If I can find some where to obtain wild boar for cooking at home I will have to go looking for a recipe and perhaps then I will find out what the seasonings were.  I visited piccolo Forno a second time to try a few other things off their menu.  Polpete Toscane were small beef & pork meatballs in a green sauce that unfortunately left a little to be desired.  The sauce was bold and flavorful but yet not enough to cover the blandness of the polpete.  Salt and pepper improved them enough to finish but not enough to order again.  piccolo Forno offers thirteen types of pizza on its menu and of course has the option to customize your own.  The Prosciutto e Rucola features crushed tomatoes and mozzarella and when it comes out of the oven it is topped with prosciutto and arugula.  The arugula is plentiful and a lot of time is devoted to piling it back on the pizza as some spills off with every bite you take but the peppery taste it adds to the pizza is worth the 'rebuilding.'  The outside edges of the crust were crisp with a chewy center but the inside of the pizza lacked a bit of firmness and would have benefitted from a few more moments in the oven.   Those who are familiar with New York style pizza would simply flip up the nose of the pizza and carry on.  This restaurant is not your typical Italian-American fare and should you walk in with that expectation you will find yourself disappointed.   The waiters are sometimes slow to attend one's table but a notable element of Italian dining is a delicious meal slowly enjoyed with friends and family.  I say take a deep breath, lean back and enjoy.",

The restaurant is great inside also with a modern, friendly atmosphere that is perpetuated by the great staff.  Affordable! Nothing on the menu is over $20. For 7 people, the bill was only $160!

Since I came at the end of the lunch hour there was no wait. The waitress was friendly enough and brought me water right away. I couldn't decide between the baked rigatoni with eggplant, the cannelloni with spinach and prosciutto or the mushroom tagliatelle so I asked the waitress to pick. She chose the baked rigatoni & I was excited to try it.  Big mistake. Yes, the portions are huge and sitting in front of me was huge bowl of gooey cheesiness that looked wonderful. The problem is that is had no taste. Really, there was no discernible flavor, only texture. I could not believe how something so cheesy & oozing with beschamel could offer nothing. There was also a massive shortage of eggplant, which I rooted around for and found very little of.  No matter how good everyone says their pizza may be, if you can't make a decent dish of pasta I'm not interested. With all of the Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh there ain't no way I'm coming back here.",

Don't go there when it's busy if you're looking for a calm ambience.  Going at off hours or on a slow weekday or eating at one of their outside tables (if you can get one) would help.  The food: The salads are large, excellent, and beautiful.  The pizzas are very good (though I don't think they're as good as when this place was called Regina Margherita - crust not as good?).  The last time I had tiramisu here it was very good, though not as good as at Lidia's in the Strip.  Service, during this Saturday 10pm visit, was disappointing: waitress took away my fork with my salad plate and I missed my microsecond window to get her attention.",

We particularly enjoyed the gnocchi, the lasagna (a bechamel/ragu combo that tastes a bit like Greek pastizio), the wild mushroom tagliatelle, and the spinach/carrot rolled thing with pesto sauce. The spinach/carrot was the highlight. The restaurant draws in a mixed crowd of older/younger diners and was a nice place to take my parents.  The only negatives were a seat in the back by the bathroom (completely negates a good ambience) and slightly unfriendly service. The polenta appetizer is also lackluster. This is a personal thing, but I was disappointed that the only dressing they had for salads is a basalmic vinaigrette. If, like me, you hate basalmic vinegar, there goes half the menu.   The pastas tasted fresh-made and all the sauces were good. The lasagna was huge--consider splitting.  On a Saturday night, we waited for about 50 minutes for a table (arrived at 7) so either go early on the weekend or plan to wait. They take your cell phone number so you don't have to hang around outside, which is great because there's a cafe down the block.",

While the BYOB policy is great, and clearly what they're known for in the neighborhood, the service is aloof rather than warm and welcoming. Definitely leaves something to be desired.    - Flies.

    "text": "Finally able to enjoy the great food at this wonderful restaurant.  The good news -- which, from the recent reviews, isn't really news -- is that PF now takes reservations for parties of five or more.  Our group -- six -- didn't know that, but we were there early on a Friday night (6.00p) so we were able to get seated within 15 minutes.  My wife and I love Italian food and we CRAVE fresh-made food in restaurants (not the pre-cooked, bagged, frozen and steamed stuff served as the chain restaurants or delivered by food service companies to local bars).  We found BOTH at PF.    We ordered a couple of appetizers: the bruschetta and the cheese/salami plate.  Both were fine, about what you'd expect in any of the local Italian eateries.    Salads and soup followed.  The salads were delicious.  Fresh greens, tasty house dressing.  The carrot soup was spot-on good.    For entrees, we ordered a variety of dishes.  A friend selected the eggplant salad as an entree.  I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she loved it.  Several pasta dishes appeared on the table.  The pastas were cooked perfectly, the variety of ingredients in each dish were not \"mashed\" together but retained their individual flavors.  I ordered the prosciutto/arugula pizza (I know, boring!) and was surprised to finally see authentic Italian pizza in Pittsburgh.   Just like the pizza I get when I'm in northern Italy.    A couple of desserts hit the table, but I didn't try them.    I love the business model at PF: fair prices for the food and BYOB.  We walked out of there on Friday having spent only $30 per person (including a 20% tip) plus the cost of a bottle of wine that each couple brought from home.    I've seen the complaints about noise.   Honestly, we found that part of the charm of the place.  It also allowed us to be as raucous as we wanted to be.    I'm so glad we finally made it for dinner.  We'll be going again, soon.  And I scoped out the Round Corner Cantina across the street.  If we go there and have a bit of a wait in the future, we'll go to the Cantina and have a drink.",

As a city, we've come to tolerate Mineo's as a standard, even though that pie would have done best being served in 1985 at Pizza Hut. Piccolo Forno doesn't approach pizza with the same regard as a heavy, greasy comfort food, and the overall build is far lighter and more dignified - like it should be.  If Il Pizziolo's is a little wetter, Piccolo Forno's a little crunchier. Satisfying in a pinch, the pizza here shows signs of a temperamental oven and was presented with an unevenness in the cooking. I want a char on the bottom; not a spotty blackness. Sauce and cheese to cover the margherita were good but not particularly notable.  I won't call it bad, but I can't say I'm altogether impressed. I would certainly eat it again, but for the price, in Pittsburgh, I expect something a little more to weigh me down.",

But a friend that I was with had their pasta and said it was one of the best meals she's had in really long time.    Ok now a separate rating of 0-1 STAR for poor restaurant management.  This place is really popular so expect a wait.  We went on a Saturday night - we must have been masochists b/c we had to wait for an 1 1/2 hours.  But hey I get it and I'm not complaining about the actual wait time.  I will complain about the inability for the restaurant staffers to move/turn tables quicker.  There were so many (not just one or two) but several tables that were done eating but were not budging from their seats.  Dozens of people were waiting to be seated.  And I get the whole lets just sit a bit after our meal, but sitting for longer than 15 minutes when there's a huge wait for other patrons is totally unacceptable and rude.  I feel that it's the restaurants responsibility to politely approach a table that's done with their meal but just lounging around to encourage them to leave.  It's also in the best interest of the restaurant if they're in the business to make money.  Faster tables turned = more groups seated = more $$$$.  Just a friendly, \"Is there anything else you'll need tonight and thanks for coming\", would probably be sufficient to subtly suggest, \"Get the hell out of here\".  But no, the staffers refused to do anything about it, and they were also getting annoyed about the groups that had been sitting for 45 minutes or longer after eating.  But I'm not sure why they refuse to do anything about it.  I feel like if they were to fix this issue, this restaurant would be one of the best in the city.  It's just poor operational managment!  Once we were seated our waitress was very attentive and friendly so I'm not criticizing the service, but the operations of the place.",

    "text": "Really amazing food, and vegetarian friendly.  Really was surprised to find this place, which reminded me of a great restaurant in the meatpacking district in Manhattan, at about 1/3rd the cost.  Never been there when it's been crowded, but the service is often appallingly slow.  I'd go there much more often - and bump this up to five stars - if it weren't an ordeal to get the bread that other tables seem to manage, or a refill on my drink.  If you have extra time, aren't in any hurry, and want great Italian that doesn't rely on marinara sauce, go now.",

    "text": "Ambiance: This place was extremely loud and crowded, my party of 6 was cramped into 2 tiny tables, but I could not hear the person across from me without yelling. Plates were constantly crashing into the floor.  Service: We had 2 waitresses, but somehow still managed constant empty water glasses, didn't get our bread basket until we requested it (even though every other table had it) and the front service was also rather rude.  Food: The appetizers themselves took almost half an hours to arrive. Taste was okay, polenta was bland. Bruschetta was nothing special. The pastas were the REAL disappointment. The mushroom ragu tagliatelle and lasagna was way overdone. I was looking forward to the 'house-made pasta' but it was just soggy and limpy. There was very little flavor in the mushroom ragu. The maccheroni was cooked okay but again, taste was very bland. The Cavatelli with the sausage and spinach was the only thing that tasted good, but my friend who ordered it came away with a terrible stomachache the next day. The pizza was nothing special either. ONLY good thing was the serving size. They were HUGE. But since everything tasted so terrible it was more of a hassle to try to finish it off when I got home. (I split it into 2 meals). The dessert tastes good, but is overpriced, and what can go wrong with gelato?  I'm open to all kinds of food but this was just not good food. I certainly do not understand why it was so busy. We had been so excited and made a reservation quite in advance due to the fact that our friend who tried to go before without one was told there would be a 3 hour wait. Avoid this place if you're looking for hearty italian!",

    "text": "An over priced pizza place that also serve some crude and basic Italian food (no, there is nothing special about it). It also has one of the worst stuff and service we have ever seen. The BYOB is probably the only bright point here. If you are for a good pizza you would do so much better up the road at the church brewery, with better ambiance and food and without the disrespectful crew, waiting in the cold by the door etc. I would never step in this place again and neither should you.",

    "text": "Piccolo forno is one of those restaurants that people seem to rave about. I fortunately was hungry tonight and visited this nice little lawrenceville spot.   First, the hostess was very nice, you don't have to wait to hear your name called, they very practically take your number and call you when you're up...duh!  After a short wait we were seated. The place has a very nice feel. Brick walls, tall ceilings and simple decor make it feel high quality without being pretentious.  Three of us shared the arugala salad, prosciutto and arugala pizza, and tagliatelle in a lamb ragu.  I also had a bowl of pasta fagioli and to be honest, it wasn't good.  I never add salt to restaurant food and especially not soup but this needed flavor and fast. Good texture but more of an unseasoned bean puree to me. The salad was everything a salad should be, light, fresh, and a great way to start a meal.  The pizza was outstanding, thin, chewy, delicious fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, all topped with a heaping  dollop of nutty arugala. Yum. Finally the tagliatelle, first, they give you a huge, american-sized portion great for sharing.  The pasta was for the most part cooked properly, though I prefer it extra al dente, this was definitely al dente. The lamb ragu was just good, flavorful, but the lamb pieces were a bit dry.   The rest of the menu looks delicious and I look forward to trying other dishes. 4 stars due to eh soup an slightly dry lamb but we'll see what next time brings.   Highly recommended.",

The atmosphere is lively, a little noisy due to the brick walls, etc, but overall I really liked it. in the back of the restaurant you can see the wood buring pizza oven.   I had the Soup of the day - Pasta Fagioli  - a vegetarian verion.  Very good and served hot.  I ordered the Proscuitto and Funghi Pizza with fresh mozzerella.  Delicious.  The service was very good, the server very pleasant.  I felt the food was quite athentic, having vacationed in Tuscany a few times - it really reminded me of that style of food.  I plan to return as there are several intersting dishes to try, including the home made fresh pasta dishes.  Next time I will remember to BYOB.  Try this place - you'll like it!",
