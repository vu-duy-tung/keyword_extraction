    "text": "Whoa, took us long enough to get here! I recommend making reservations as far in advance as you can for weekends if you want a decent shot at eating at normal dinner hour. Luckily I finally remember to do so! Our reservations were at 7, we got their early anticipating that we would have to grab a drink at the bar but they were ready for us (sweet)! Our server was barely polite, he never did tell us his name. Lucky for him we were just excited to be there. We got cocktail beverages out of their extensive list, which were both very good. As an appetizer we ordered a cheese plate and the runner did explain all the cheeses in it, yum! Now, the wait...  About 45 min to an hour later, with no acknowledgment that our food was on its way from our not so pleasant server we were very hungry. Where was our food? Just as we were able to ask, it came. I had the scallops and he had the hanger steak. We were both very satisfied with our meals. They were so delicious, thank goodness, after that wait! We opted out of dessert in fear we'd have to wait another hour. The decor and ambiance is very cool and interesting with its wild game. It's very intimate but is pretty dark! So make sure your phone is charged for the flash light. After all the hype the service was pretty disappointing. We were there for 2 hours! They could've have another couple in and out in that time. Now I know why there is such a long wait. BUT the food will definitely bring us back!",

We had different variety of appetizers to try and most of us had grilled filet, which also was really good. Now the server we had.. I wished I had got her name... she was so miserable and wasn't afraid to hide it. She looked like she didn't want anything to do with us. I even confronted her as to why she was so angry.. her excuse \"she worked all day\". Either yins are working you're employees to much or she just needs to find new career. As miserable as she was she shouldn't be working in public! Besides that miserable server, everything else was fine. I would come back but I would like to have a happier server.",

Waiter commented that it takes longer for that entree making me wish he had said that when I placed the order.  And definitely don't order the chocolate cake dessert, awful.  Not only did it taste bad, it was $9 for what amounted to two small bites.  Now that I've eaten at both Butcher and the Rye and Meat and Potatoes, my opinion is that unless you dying for cassoulet, there are other restaurants with better food choices.",

    "text": "\"Butcher and the Rye.\"  The name catches one's attention.  Before they opened, I was checking their Twitter and Facebook pages to get updates on when they would open.  They were posting pictures on twitter such as their impressive collection of whiskey.  I was excited.  Really excited.  This place had to be good. I was ready to go opening week.  I was ready to be impressed.  I was ready for a place that would serve awesome food (creative or simple) and great drinks, like the many places I've visited in other major cities.  Unfortunately, Butcher and the Rye became the dictionary definition of disappointment for me.  Food (7.5/10) = Tried the following dishes:  1) House bread with 3 different spreads (apple butter, honey butter, can't remember the third) = Nothing special.  It was just bread.  I thought the honey butter was the best of the three spreads.  The quantity of spreads greatly exceeds the amount of bread provided (Four dinner rolls).  If you are going to charge $4-6 (can't remember the exact price), surely you would expect more bread.  It was just bread.  One kind.  Not the basket/board with an assortment of different breads other restaurants have on their menu when they slap a similar price tag.    2) Cauliflower with farro, romanesco, carrot, brown butter, harissa = ($10) = $10 for a small bowl of meh cauliflower?!  My group ended up ordering this dish per recommendation of our waitress.  I don't have a problem paying high prices for incredible food.  However, I was not impressed.  My group was not impressed.  The flavors were forgettable.  The price on the other hand was not; this dish is way-overpriced.  3) Manicotti with apple bourbon butter, oxtail, pecorino, pickled apples = $10 = The flavors of this dish were good but not great.  You get 4 pieces, each the size of approx. 2.5 x 1.0 inches.  Like the cauliflower, the dish is not worth $10 to me.  4) Baked Camembert with phyllo, apple, olive oil, rosemary, grilled bread = $15 = another just ok dish.  We ended up ordering this since an old couple next to us raved how good it was.  Sure the apples were good.  The cheese by itself was good.  But the flavors collectively were just ok.  Again, a dish not worth $15.  5) Bone Marrow with oxtail jam, pickled orange rind, sea salt, parsley salad = $12 = The ONLY dish that was worth what we paid for.  The flavor of the fatty bone marrow from the long bone cut down it's long axis is incredible.    6) \"Pig Candy\" (pork belly with miso caramel sauce, apple kimchi, daikon, cilantro) = $8 = The flavor was great.  The meat could be more tender.  The size?  Just 3 small bites.  Another dish not worth the price Butcher and the Rye charges.  $8?  Maybe worth $5 at most.  Not even David Chang of Momofuku in NYC, is charging this much for his pork belly (which in my opinion is the best pork belly prepared with Asian flavors in North America).   Service (7.5/10) = Service was somewhat slow during the first opening week, and the place was crowded.  So it's understandable.    Ambiance (10/10) = Like others have mentioned, the decor of this place is damn impressive.  From the glass jars over the ceiling lights, the wooden communal tables, the fork and spoon wallpaper on the ceiling, and the giant wall of whiskey.  It's obvious a lot of effort was placed in designing this new restaurant, with close attention to detail.  I can't remember the last time I gave a 10/10 for a restaurant's ambiance.     Overall opinion = While the decor is amazing, the food is lackluster and way overpriced.  As I mentioned, I don't have a problem dropping $$$$ for incredible food. I've done it at 3-star Michelin restaurants.  I've done it many times at high end places in cities such as San Francisco and NYC.  However, $10 for a small bowl of forgettable cauliflower?  $8 for a small slice of pork belly that's not even cooked to perfection?  Even if the prices were reasonable, I still wouldn't give this place more than 3 Yelp stars.  If for some reason I visit this restaurant again, the only thing I will order is the bone marrow and a beer. \"Butcher and the Rye.\"  While the name catches one's attention, unfortunately the food did not catch mine in a positive way.",

The octopus was a little chewy but the accompanying polenta cake was delicious. We had the scallops on risotto and the halibut, both perfectly cooked and very good. The drinks here are outstanding: really interesting, delicious and a variety of choices. The only bad part of the meal unfortunately was the bartender. Since we were sitting at the bar, he was also our main server. We both found him rude, pretentious and unhelpful.

    "text": "We've heard so many good things about Butcher and the Rye, and it did not disappoint.  The food, the drinks, the ambience, the whole package is very appealing.  I sampled 2 of the cocktails - there are so many to choose from and our waiter helped me to find a few options to suit my taste.  My husband is more of a beer drinker and although their offerings are limited, he found a few upscale beers that were to his liking.  Based on Yelp recommendations, we tried the Pig Candy appetizer.  I had the Scallops with Crab Risotto and my husband had one of their beef specials.  We also split a dessert, the daily special Pot De Creme.  Everything was truly amazing - very creative preparations and spot-on seasonings/flavors.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the waitstaff - our waiter was excellent, as were the other employees who brought our food or bused the table.  Really an outstanding experience all the way around, I can't wait to go back again!",

Yes yes, I know it wants to be a meat place, but there's no reason to make everything pork fat dependent. Vegetarians could have a nice time there with a little more thought to dish adaptability. The Brussels were way over cooked. Cauliflower saved the day. Great ambiance and attention to physical detail.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came here for the first time on Restaurant week.  It was pretty crowded for a Wednesday night, which to me is a good and bad sign. Good bc it means people like the place and bad if there was a wait, which there was no wait but it could be bc we made reservations.  The strange part to me (which made me give a 4/5 stars) was when we were seated, the host ushered us to one of the long tables by the bar, which already had customers dining and the host wanted us to sit in between the other diners.  We didn't know that it was like that, and it would've been fine to dine with others except we really wanted to be able to talk to each other that night without having to scream or have less privacy.  We did decide we'll just dine by the stools across from the bar.  I think when making reservations, the host should ask if guests are comfortable sitting with others before seating them there bc after an hour or so of sitting on the bar stools, it was definitely uncomfortable.  They could've offered to seat us somewhere else being that we did make reservations and I saw there were empty tables.  That aside, I did like the decor and atmosphere.  The food is one of the best I've had in pittsburgh.  I travel a lot and have tried a lot of food in other major cities and this place is definitely one to brag for pitt!  For starters, I had the oxtail french onion soup, which I do recommend but there were parts that were tough to eat bc some of the toasted bread was burnt.  The fiance had a salad.  I forgot which one.  For pasta dish, I had the mac and cheese, which was so creamy and tasty. Fiance had the braised rabbit pappardelle.  It was yummy!  tasted like dark meat chicken.  We enjoyed the pasta dishes.  My fave was the entree.  I had the fish with the wasabi mashed.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  Seems to be seared on the outside but it's like butter.  Tasteful butter.  Haha.  Really thoughtful dish!  The flavors blended so well on this dish.  Eventhough the portion was small, I enjoyed every bite of it and it was just enough if you had the pasta dish.  Fiance had the roasted chicken with the mushrooms, creamed brussels and grapes, which was also a very good.  for dessert, I had the deep fried brownie which was a beer battered peanut butter brownie with peanut praline and bananas served with bittersweet chocolate.  I'm a chocoholic, so it was divine to me.  Fiance had the coconut cream cheese ice cream on carrot cake with candied pineapples, which again is so creative and delish!  If you love whiskey, you should try this place as they have different varieties of aged whiskey.  My fiance tried a flight but beware of the price.  I didn't know whiskey was that expensive.  It was $75 for 3 whiskey \"shots,\" which were 10, 12, 30 yr old whiskey, but he said he enjoyed it.  I think other flights were less than that.  tried a non-alcoholic drink, which wasn't that great to me for the price.  Overall, the food was definitely amazing at this place and would definitely recommend.  The chef should join food network's chopped bc the dishes he made were delicious and creative!",

We started with 2 specialty cocktails, Salinger's Sling, and the Boulevardier. Both were mixed expertly and we each had 2 more. We ordered the Charcuterie Board and Mac N Cheese as our apps, and promptly destroyed both. The Legend doesn't get loud about much, but he was singing the praises of that Mac n cheese to the high heavens! Next came our entrees of Scallops for me, and Hanger Steak du Poivre for My Love. Both were absolutely phenomenal, and I can safely say, I've never had scallops prepared more perfectly. The hanger steak was seasoned well, and potatoes had a lovely crisp on them. My blue crab risotto was to die for, creamy, and not the least bit gummy. No dessert for the Legend or I this evening, but one more cocktail? Don't mind if we do!",

Had the Candy Bacon, which lacked any seasoning and the skin was limp instead of crispy as I would have expected having had similar pork belly dishes at various other restaurants across the country. I also had the short ribs which were equally if not even more bland, frankly they were perfectly braised and tender, however they lacked any seasoning or flavor. Bland food was the theme I came away with for this 'gastropub'...   A little bit of salt goes a long way and would have made this a 4-5 star. I would personally pair either of these dishes with various smoked sea salts and the short ribs would have been perfect, the pork belly still would have lacked the crispiness expected.",

After reading so many Yelp reviews praising the Brussels Sprouts and the Dirty Pasta, that's the two dishes I ordered and am so happy I did so, cause they were delicious!  Also, I wanted to lay off the alcohol so told the awesome bartender my taste prefs (rhubarb, ginger, lemon lime & berry) and she made me a delicious mock tail that totally wasn't on the menu #felt special!  The food here really lives up to expectations. My Brussels Sprouts were crispy and crunchy and the seasoning and accompanying sauce were super addictive. This dish also really balanced out the more earthy flavor of the ground duck in the Dirty Pasta. And speaking of that pasta, yummo!! It was so perfectly fresh and al dente.  The food left a smile on my tummy and serving sizes were very generous so I had leftovers and also no space for dessert (which looked party darn good - will just have to try when I come back).  One more note - the atmosphere here is really awesome! It was great sitting at the bar, as to my left was a local bloke who works as a sommelier in Pittsburgh, and we got chatting about food and wine and bartered restaurant names in Dublin.  If you are a Pittsburgh local who hasn't already been here, run don't walk, and make a reservation to dine here and enjoy the amazing eats!  Note: #342 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to like this place. This was my first time visiting Pittsburgh and I'd read up on all the places that are a \"must-try\". 4.5 stars on Yelp. Rave reviews. Even an off-day here should be amazing. Right?   When we walked in it looked very promising. The maitre d looked, fittingly, pompous yet disinterested- tasked with being the gatekeeper of the culinary experience that must await while also being cool enough to not take it all too seriously. The ambiance and the vibe inside was very young and hip, the decor- a bit dark but an impressive array of butcher themed artwork, meat cleavers and mounted animal heads, all apt design choices.   The menu options were almost all things that couldn't help but sound delicious. Fried Brussels sprouts under a mountain of Parmesan? Ummm, yes please. Pork candy? Not sure what that is, but we'll take 2 because how could you not? Tartare with parmesan crusted something and truffle something something? You had me at truffle something. Roasted bone marrow? Bring it on. And those were just our appetizers. For our entree a rack of lamb on a bed of pillowy polenta. Of course this was going to be nothing short of amazing.    Our plates came out looking as you'd expect. Sauces and creams artfully smeared. Parmesan cheese masterfully shaved. Microgreens and garnishes painstakingly placed. And it all tasted... just okay. Dish after dish, all with so much promise, all either a bit under-seasoned, a bit unimaginative or a bit basic- but all underwhelming, and all a little overpriced.   Maybe this was just an off night? Or maybe this is rated on a scale relative to the rest of Pittsburgh's food scene (which I'd heard good things about). But after going back and reading some of the not-so-gushing reviews, it seems there are others who have had an experience similar to ours. So I'm left wondering what all the hype is about.",

    "text": "This is a really popular restaurant, with a diverse menu and a two-fisted cooking style.  This style works well with pub favorites and appetizers, like the excellent rabbit rillettes (not enough toast) and the grilled radicchio salad (small).  The main plates lacked finesse and were very heavy.  Yes, the scallops were grilled perfectly, but the accompanying \"crab risotto\" was a mushy mess of over-cheesed rice that did not allow the crab to emerge.  Same with the chicken dish: the meat part was very good, the mushroom duxelles tasty but way too heavy. Because we still had that great rillettes dish, we ordered the sourdough bread (baked in house), it was ok but nothing particular. The beer list was not very distinguished (no local beers) but a few good US breweries were listed (not on tap). The service was very good, given the crowds.  A solid 3.5 restaurant food-wise.",

Everything was delicious and the flavors were just right. I would recommend everything we ordered and would order it again. The drinks were also very good, their cocktail list is very extensive.  In terms of service, this needs some improvement. We had reservations at 7:30 but we were not seated until 7:40. We didn't get our drinks together, I got mine first and then my husband got his at a later time point. We got the wrong order for our main course, but were compensated at the end for this which we appreciated. For our bill, they had charged us for an extra entree that we had to ask to be taken off before we paid.  Overall, I would come back to this restaurant because the food was top notch and there is a nice atmosphere.",

Have you ever had brie with peanut butter? You should! We also had the bone marrow- it was my first time trying marrow and I thought it was great!

    "text": "**Disclaimer: I'm not 21, so I couldn't partake in the alcohol that this place is famous for, but sitting in front of the bartender all night made me excited to come back when I'm legal.**  I came to Butcher and the Rye with my dad for a nicer dinner than the kind I usually get in Oakland, and it definitely was a much more upscale atmosphere. Their menu of entrees is a bit limited -- understandable, since it's more of a bar than a traditional full restaurant -- so we instead chose to order a few small plates and an entree.   The Brussels sprouts had good flavor present from the way they were cooked; charred and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The lemon aioli was a nice accompaniment. I normally love Brussels sprouts, but unfortunately these were the low point of the night because after a few bites, the flavors were all sort of overtaken by overwhelming saltiness. It was still good, but the oiliness of the sprouts became more evident as well.  The octopus was similarly a bit disappointing. Something about the texture felt a bit off to me. With that said, the bean cakes that it was served on were delicious, and complimented it well, so we had no problem at all eating it (especially the smaller pieces that were nice and crispy on the outside). Pig candy was our third small plate, and that was delicious. Miso caramel sauce made the flavors much more complex and exciting than straightforward glazed pork belly, but didn't take away from the simple goodness of the meat itself either.  We ordered the dirty pasta as an entree, and that was similarly at once simple and intriguing. The brandy added a layer of sweetness that worked well with the duck and made it an interesting, unusual pasta dish.  Dessert was my personal favorite part of the meal. The rosemary ice cream was a standout flavor, popcorn cookies enhanced both the taste and the presentation, and lemon pound cake is pretty much always a win.  Butcher in the Rye has some interesting concepts -- some are well-executed and some fall just a bit flat depending, I'm sure, on the night. Overall, though, it's well worth a try.",

I do mind the seating, though. There's one of those long booths along the back wall with tables really packed in. I was seated at the booth and had to squeeze between our table and our neighbor's table in order to exit. I'm an average sized human and it was very difficult to maneuver without knocking things around. I understand that restaurants want to optimize space but I found it to be uncomfortable.

    "text": "Yeah, maybe this place is trendy. Yeah, maybe you're sick of the 4,000 photos of the whiskey wall on your social feeds. Yeah, maybe Butcher seems overhyped...but honestly, the place IS awesome.  If there's one complaint, it would be the hostess station, where - as both casual observers and customers - we've seen some arrogance and rudeness toward patrons who perhaps walked in, unaware of how busy Butcher gets, and were curious about getting a table. Pretentious attitude from a hostess? Yeah, they might want to curb that sooner, rather than later, being the host stand is your first impression.  Anyway, I digress...save yourself that hassle and make reservations. Butcher is almost always busy, and it's not always easy to post up in the bar area.  As for the whiskey, Butcher has one heck of a variety on-hand. You'll pay the price if you want to go deep, but there are plenty of excellent, cost-friendly choices on the menu, as well. It's an overwhelming amount of choices, so I'd recommend downloading the Grail app, so you can peruse their whiskey list ahead of time!  There are two things that make Butcher worth going, though, that I think is better than the whiskey (let's face it, unless you're looking to drop $25+ on a 1oz pour of some hard-to-find spirits, you can get a solid whiskey at most places nowadays): the food, and the service.  We've NEVER had bad service at Butcher. We've had a party of two...up to a party of 50+, and the service has always been top-notch. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to chat with. They'll be able to steer you in the direction of a whiskey that's in your budget, and they'll be able to provide in-depth info of the food menu. Oh...and you'll never have an empty glass of water (a huge plus to me).  The food is excellent, albeit indulgent. For example, the brussels sprouts are phenomenal, but I can't tell if the brussels themselves are good, or it's just the delicious filth that tops them. Frankly, I don't care, though. Delicious is delicious is delicious. The mac & cheese, shishito peppers, bread, baked camembert, bone marrow...you name it, we've tried it. All of it has been enjoyable...but indulgent, like I said. Don't stop in looking to eat a \"healthy\" meal. Stop in with pure American gluttony in mind. To clarify, though, the portions aren't gluttonous, but the flavor is.  My favorite menu item, though, is the Butcher Burger. Ground in-house, and limited to 20 per day. Get there early and get one. It's one of the best burgers in the city, hands down. It's not loaded with a bunch of nonsense, either. The burger meat gets most of the spotlight, and it deserves a spotlight (it may actually need one to be seen in Butcher's very dark atmosphere).  Enjoy!",

I honestly have no idea what was in them but they were all great!  We had a very nice friendly server who gave us great prompt service. She had good recommendations and was very helpful.  We ordered the pork belly on kimchi and if you like pork I would say def gotta try this! I usually don't like kimchi but I thought it was actually really good. We also got the Brussels sprouts and everybody loved them but I'm not a huge fan of brussel  sprouts. We also ordered the Mac a cheese and its was soooo creamy and yummy. Not too heavy and had a nice crunch on top. I didn't think Pittsburgh would have anything cool like this.. I really enjoyed this place and their new sister store next door, tako. I would come back to both!",

We sat outside which was nice on a fall evening and perfect for dinner with a toddler. We had two of their featured cocktails - the pistachio one was to die for with a delectable creamy deliciousness. I could have had several without realizing it. For appetizers, we had the pig candy - crispy pork belly with apple Kim chi and caramel - this was nice and crunchy and was complimented by the sweet sauce; mac n cheese; and grilled octopus - this was a special appetizer and it came with a crispy polenta served with chickpeas and a pureed veggie. For our main dishes, we had the roasted chicken - delicious with wild mushrooms, creamed Brussels and grapes - nice combo of sweet and savory flavors. We also had the smoked lamb beck served with feta, spicy greens, beans and chimichurri. If you like lamb, this would be a good dish for you. The meat fell off the bone it was so tender. We had to finish the meal off with dessert - almond cake and pumpkin pie. Yum! Definitely a must eat on a visit to Pittsburgh.",

So many cocktails! I saw that the rye buck, sazerac, and the manhattan were under classics (and they're my favorites!). At $10 each, they were at a nice price point, too. I was able to grab a seat at the bar, and just devour my drink and do some hardcore people watching. It's definitely a lively atmosphere with a ton of energy! Wish we could have tried the food, but I guess there's always a next time. We were there for one drink, and then we were out to explore the rest of downtown.",

    "text": "I struggle with \"bests\".  But as of right now, this is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their menu has a lot of originality and creativity in it.  There's a nice balance of foods and everything I have had there has been wonderful.    Best brussel sprouts in the burgh, and there's LOTS of competition  Pig Candy is a must try.    And of course...the rye flight.  Staff knows their business.  The young woman who waited on my sister and I during our most recent visit impressed me with her knowledge of the menu and the bar, steering us deftly toward options that satisfied our palates and warned us of impending danger (one example:  \"they say that one in twelve shishito peppers is really hot, but lately they've been trending a bit hotter\" - in response to my sister's question regarding whether the shishito small plate might be too spicy for her)  If there's any downside it's that some of the seating is cramped and shoulder to shoulder with adjacent tables.  And it's noisy, which might stand between you and that romantic evening out that you'd planned.  If you make reservations far enough in advance, a table of four will get you seated beneath the \"antler chandelier\" where the tables are a bit larger and the elbow room a substantially improved.  But if you don't mind lifting your voice a bit, and making new friends, then I think Butcher is lock for a great night out with a friend.",

The Mac and cheese was fantastic, and I could probably have eaten two bowls full!  The halibut left me wanting more. There were too many veggies on my plate in my personal opinion, and there was something in the sauce with them that when it encountered my Halibut made it taste sour and not well cooked.  The restroom is a little hard to get used to. Small with weird doors. You'll get what I mean when you go.  Otherwise the service was friendly and the waiter was great.

I've never had bad service here, never had a bad meal, and I've definitely never had a bad drink. Drinks in the main dining room are something, but if you want to really experience a phenomenal drink, reserve yourself a seat at the upstairs bar and ask for Cecil. He'll ask you what you typically drink, and from that he will concoct for you the most amazing thing you've ever had. Just from me telling him I like red wine and vodka he put together a drink for me of items I've never had before and it is exactly something that I would drink again and again. In fact, after looking at the extensive drink menu I had been pulled back to one particular drink but hadn't mentioned it and that was the exact drink that he ended up making for me. One of my favorite places to visit in Pittsburgh, hands-down.",

Fresh burrata with sweet and tart plums. Lamb neck Sunday sauce that only needed more bread to get every last drop. And the best pork belly I've ever had - pork candy. A must try for everyone!!

    "text": "Ideally, I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but we'll go crazy and round up :-)  We made a reservation and due to some downtown traffic, we were running late.  We called and they were nothing but understanding and able to hold our table for us.  We started with splitting the beet salad, which was amazing.  I loved the combination of fennel, beets, and goat cheese croutons.  The blood orange vinaigrette melded all of the flavors together and left you with a bright, crunchy, refreshing start to the meal.  I had the \"Vesper\" to drink.  It reminded me of a mild lemon drop martini, not overly flavored. It was very good, but I'm not sure I'd ever crave that or list it as my favorite drink.  For my entree, I ordered the \"Dirty Pasta\".  The noodles reminded me of an elongated cavatelli in a savory, cheese sauce with ground duck, sage and plenty of Parmesan Reggiano on top.  The portion was more than enough, and I even had a small portion left over for lunch the next day!  My dining partner got the hanger steak.  It was cooked perfectly, amazingly tender for a hanger steak.  Our only issue was the meat was a little over-salted, but that is likely more our preference.  The ambiance was very hipster-y, with dark, patterned wallpapers and a big, standing, stuffed bear adjacent to our table.  It was a little dark inside.  If you're dining with older guests, maybe bring along your flashlight to help them out!  My only disappointment was not having any room for dessert!  Next time, I'm saving belly room all day in order to eat more here!",

The cocktails were creative, and refreshingly tasty. For dinner we shared four appetizers and a dessert. Two appetizers were small - pork belly and pork wing. The pork wing I would order again. It was crispy with a nice peanut sauce. The pork belly was good, but didn't stand out from other pork belly appetizers I have ordered at other restaurants. Plus it was a little too chewy for my liking. The other two appetizers we ordered were fairly large in size. We selected the mac and cheese which had a crunchy breadcrumb topping, and the brussel sprouts. I never thought I would say this when I had pork and cheesy goodness in front of me, but the brussel sprouts were my favorite dish. They were charred just right, and had a creamy dill sauce to compliment them. As for dessert, we ordered cinnamon sugar doughnut balls accompanied by cardamom ice cream. This dinner was very satisfying, and I can see why you need to make a reservation early in the week!",

However for the price, they really could improve the 20 min wait time for a server to stop by and buy more than just one iPad to view the menu.  Great concept but I would like to peruse the selections while I drink, not continually have to ask the server to bring it back.   Think about an app or something. Word of Beer does the iPad/app thing and it's great.   Like the atmosphere and location, especially being collocated to their delicious Tako restaurant.   Would also like to see more seating options, especially for disabled people, as the space is narrow and tight, which makes it a little tricky for a wheelchair if you can't score a table. I will say however the staff did you a great job making the best effort to accommodate. Some friendly patrons moved as well to make space.  Very cool, Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "My #1 Pittsburgh Restaurant Week choice was here.  So weeks in advance I booked a reservation for Wednesday.  This was the only day available that I could get a reservation at a normal dinner hour time.  I have tried in the past to make reservations here and because I am not into eating dinner at 11:45 pm, I have been unsuccessful.  But here we were, and I was so excited to finally try B&R especially during Restaurant week.  For starters we were seated pretty promptly upstairs in a long communal type of table.  Though the tables themselves were separated (as they had to be in order to get in and out) you could easily reach to your left or right and hold the stranger sitting next to you.  It also induced an awkward situation that the waiter had  to talk to the back of my husband's head all night unless he wanted to do a 180 to speak at him directly.  The place was also very dark, which led to an unfortunate incident I shall unveil at the proper time.  Not initimatly dark, but more like bedtime dark with flickering candles.    So to the food, again extremely excited, and again looked online at their Restaurant week menu and was eager to try the menu, but alas without making it known on Restaurant week's website, the chef decided to change the menu daily.  I can't remember what was on the website but I recall being disappointed because I really wanted to try it.  Due to the new findings the hubs ordered off the regular menu.  He went with the WAGYU FLANK STEAK prepared medium.  I stuck to the altered restaurant week menu that had four courses.  1)corn fritters with an aoli 2) a pea soup with half a toasted cheese sammie 3) A seafood pasta dish 4) A flaky cream pastry with lemon, berries and a chocolate sauce.  I also ordered a couple overpriced Manhattans.  The food came at a good pace.  The corn fritters were rather good but were sitting in a vessel on top of the sauce making it difficult to dip them individually (had to ask for some extra on the side).  Next the pea soup and cheese sandwich.  This was definitely the best thing I had that evening.  The pea soup was delightful.  The gourmet grilled cheese great flavor and worked well together with the creamy pea soup.  I will say from here my dining experience started to plummet.  Next my seafood pasta came out along with the wagyu for my husband.  So remember how it was really dark in there?  The dish was prepared with a darker noodle and my first bit was full of shrimp and prawn shells.  They left all the shells on in this dark place hidden in this dark dish.  I spent the rest of the time picking shells out of my teeth and feeling the pain of regret.  At one point I pulled a huge prawn whisker from my mouth and said that's it I can't eat this anymore.  Funny thing, my very close neighbor, who I could hear easily, flagged down the waiter and began to tell him how much she disliked her meal and I quote \"this tastes like a fishes ass.\"  Sadly I looked down and we were eating the same thing.  To add to the disappointment my husband's wagyu was tough.  I mean a $30.00 steak should melt in your mouth and it was so tough and chewy, just not a choice cut whatsoever.    The desert was average to me, I am not a big sweets fan.  I split this with my husband who adamantly believes fruit doesn't belong in deserts unless it's apple pie. But nevertheless helped me eat it.  I would try B&R again, but it's not at the top of my list since there are many other good places that you don't have to book a month in advance to visit .",

I had the sugo pasta and she had the halibut.  My dish was hearty and incredibly flavorful, while hers was milder but had a great combination of flavors.   As far as drinks go, I had one of the most alcoholic I've ever had - the morning glory - and although it was delicious, I felt like after a couple sips I'd be capable of breathing fireballs...that's what bourbon, absinthe, cognac, and champagne in one glass will do for ya.  We ended with the cheese plate, and that confirmed that Butch & Rye is a place I'll have to come back to!",

The hand pulled burrata was equally tasty.   Dirty pasta was good and the pumpkin cheesecake was decent. But the pot de creme egg nog that evening? Sinful. So good, it hurts. I clearly ordered the wrong dessert.    Also, big kudos to the decorator. Every time I looked away or stared off in the distance, I'd discover something new. Service was also excellent.",

    "text": "Walked here from the convention center in about 10 minutes. This place came with heavy recommendation from several people. My first impression of the place was great. Huge American Flag hanging to the right of the entry door. In a time of such tension I appreciate the display of pride! The rest of the place has a trendy, eclectic vibe. Of all the bars I have been to this place has the coolest feel.   We sat at the first floor bar, went upstairs but it was slow so we opted for more activity downstairs. Our bartender Giuseppe (hope that's spelled right) was prompt and informative. We were told this place has hundreds of whiskeys on hand..... and that's no joke! If you have any interest in whiskey this is the spot.   During the time it took to have a few drinks we bothered Giuseppe with several questions. He answered them all without hesitation. My impression of Giuseppe is he is a True bartender. It is clear he has a passion for what he does. He worked up an \"Old Fashion\" for me and it was top notch. Keep up the good work!   When some friends arrived we moved to a table away from the bar. I had the \"Phillips Head\" and it was a good drink. We did not eat so I can not provide any guidance on food.   If I lived here this would be added into my to my rotation of places. Great service, awesome vibe, draws a good crowd.",

    "text": "I've only been here once thus far but my experience was stellar. My wife and I were having an evening in the city and when we were unable to get into the restaurant we originally intended to dine at that evening due to an unexpected crowd and a lack of reservations, we managed to slide into Butcher & the Rye as they opened for the evening. We lacked a reservation and we could only get bar seats, but they were quite sufficient. We sat at the upstairs bar and the bartenders were knowledgeable and skilled, preparing some of the best mixed drinks I've had in the city (or anywhere, for the matter), and they were also among the friendliest bartenders I've had anywhere. My wife and I had burgers which were admittedly on the lower end of their price range because we hadn't really intended on anything higher-scale for the evening, but their burgers were excellent, fries were above-average and the service was wonderful.  I fully intend to return here multiple times to sample their higher-end fare as my first impromptu experience with them was wonderful and may possibly be the best first impression I've had with dining establishments in the city.  The only downside I can really rate them on is their hours, as they seem to be rather limited. If you want to dine there I strongly suggest planning ahead and making reservations; I get the succinct feeling I was lucky to squeeze in when I did the night I was there.  Update: went back for my birthday and was not disappointed. Everything we had was delicious and service was superb.",

I will definitely be going back just for that. The only downside to the marrow was that the bones were too big for the appetizer plate and made eating it more difficult. Our group of four had nothing but great things to say about the food (Hanger Steak, Monkfish Osso Buco, Dirty Pasta and Beef Tongue Ravioli) and I cannot wait to go back.  The only other criticism was service was a little slow and missed small things like bringing a spoon for soup or a lot of downtime between drinks - but you could tell they were pretty busy on a Friday night. Overall though, pretty awesome place.",

Shared the brussel sprouts, which were great and the preserved lemon aioli was a great pairing and had a really nice presentation.  also, at bartender's suggestion, tried the bacon candy.  was a little apprehensive as I'm not always on the pork belly bandwagon--sometimes it is just too fatty and, well, just grosses me out.  but this one was great.  it was cooked SO well so it had some crunch, some chewiness (in a good way) and some, I don't know, denseness? just delicious. the miso caramel sauce was a great combo of sweet and savory.  So why 4 stars instead of 5? it was a tough decision, as far as Yelp goes :) and maybe I am being too critical but...here goes:  there was a lot of cilantro on the bacon candy, which was good.  But a lot of it was mostly long stems, or long stems with one leaf, so I found myself picking the leaves off and putting the stems to the side.  Did I have to do this? probably not, but did it make the dish a lot better, to me? yep.  also, and i know it's because it is a \"hot spot\" and whatever else, but I felt the bar area was sort of chaotic (NOT behind the bar; bartenders were great) and could have been a bit better managed so as not to be constantly jostled by other patrons and servers (whose way everyone was certainly in) :)   I would definitely go back though and look forward to trying the other spots in this group.",

I went with the frisee salad as an appetizer which was the perfect size and mix of ingredients followed by the scallops with crab risotto. I was so pleased with my meal I'll be sure to come back here for a special occasion next time I have friend or family visiting from out of town!",

    "text": "I'll preface this review with the warning that I cannot judge the restaurant for their whiskey offerings -- I can only speak to the quality of the food.   I ordered the braised rabbit which was poorly cooked and poorly seasoned. The salt monster definitely got me on this dish! The dish also lacked a general cohesiveness (though it is hard to balance a rabbit dish that is overly-seasoned). The undercooked accompanying vegetables could not hold up to the hearty protein.   I can see the appeal, especially if someone is looking to impress on a first date. I think the quality of food for the price they demand is incredibly insulting. Perhaps others were intimidated by the impressive decor (and whisky wall) and overlooked the integrity of the food.   Also why is it so dark in here?",

    "text": "We visited for Restaurant Week so we could try something different for a relatively low price.   For $39 we had a very satisfying meal with an attentive server Coleen.  We were seated on the 3rd level at a table with very soft chairs. We joked that we did not need utensils since we could easily put our chins on the table. We are not tiny people.  Coleen moves us to a much better table but it was still pretty dark.  Have you ever had to use your phone to shed enough light on the menu to read it.  That's what I'm talking about.  There should be a rule about how dark a restaurant can be. The candle was no help.  We could barely see what we were eating but that didn't stop us from cleaning our plates.  The food was excellent.  We had a drink at the small bar and the bartenders were very friendly.  One of them wrote down the recipe for one of the drinks.  It only had 13 ingredients, it was s long list.    Only 4 stars because it was too dark. Otherwise a very good choice just bring your miners hat with you.",

We also ordered the brussel, cauliflower, duck liver and the pork candy. The brussel was a bit salty for me, especially the outer layers. Once I removed those the taste was wonderful. Cauliflower was so-so, though we don't like the sauce on the plate. The duck liver and the pork candy were fantastic! Both were very flavourful and the tastes were not too strong. Would definitely recommend.   We did not try their large plates today and their criapy octopus ran out today. Would love to be back to try more of their food next time! Definitely a good 5 star restaurant. One of the really great ones in the Pittsburgh area.",

There were two open chairs but not THREE chairs, so one of us had no seat and had to stand. Again-no problem; hey just trying to get a drink. All was well until manager who had told us that the empty tables that were reserved  and not available for us now informed us that there is no standing at the bar.   Soooo....not able to sit at reserved tables that are empty. Not allowed to stand at the bar. We were told that we would have to go somewhere else until seating opened up. Uh, yeah. I love being sent into the streets and asked to return when it was more convenient for the establishment. You run a SERVICE business, correct?   Once the charms of the handle-barred mustached bar muddlers with their knowledge of 18 different bitters has faded into history, like the pet rock, the owners of this property will have plenty of time to realize that they DON'T sell food and drink but rather their product is customer service- as they explore the vagaries of inevitable Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Perhaps they should ask the former owners of Tender how the no standing policy worked out?",

They had several tables that could seat 4 people outside. The temperature outside was so perfect out. At that time of day, you're in the shade at the outside dining tables. The penicillin cocktail was great. We shared the oxtail raviolo app. The flavors were so complex. We loved the dish! The best part of the meal was the SMOKED LAMB SHANK entree! It was sooo delicious, and you get so much meat with that dish. I got the rabbit dish, and it was good. I'm just a big carnivore, so I had wished there was more meat to the dish rather than shreds of rabbit incorporated into the sauce. Highly recommend checking out this restaurant!",

Perhaps, I don't really know how to appreciate pasta - but I thought this was ok - saltier than I liked. Duck was good but just overall didn't leave a lasting impression.

This was the star-removing event for an otherwise excellent meal. Butcher and the Rye has a vast menu of cocktails, which for me was not appealing because I don't drink. To my delight, they have some secret house-brewed non-alcoholic beverages that are utterly delightful. I enjoyed the lemon, herb, and apricot non-alcoholic drink, my dining partner had the basil, ginger, lime drink- also fantastic. They are small batch and delicious.   We were there during Restaurant Week, so I ordered off the Prix Fixe menu, and had the lamb belly/ tongue rillette, seafood risotto, and flourless chocolate cake. My friend had the beet salad and the regular scallops risotto. The seafood risotto was complex, briney, and multi-layered. The rillette was underspiced, I felt it could have benefitted from a smoked treatment with one of the meats. The cake was fantastic.   Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and very friendly, almost making up for the attitudinal host, who threw us similar shade as we left the restaurant. A shame to have an otherwise excellent meal bookended by her wall of snobbery.",

My friend and I go out to a new restaurant once a month - always each get an appetizer and entree - then depending on our hunger - sometimes dessert.  While we didn't get dessert this trip - the appetizers and entrees were amazing!  I got the dry aged tartare appetizer - So stinking good.  Our waitress was fantastic - as I asked what she recommended.  She suggested the bone marrow - which when I asked if it was similar to meat and potatoes - she suggested the tartare.  (Their bone marrow's are similar - so I wanted something different).    My entree was the Seared Scallops.  I've tried the dirty pasta during restaurant week - and wasn't a fan, so I was looking forward to something different.  Best.choice.ever  The scallops were like butter and melted in my mouth.  Everything else (Risotto, asparagus, and everything else) was so so SO good!

Immediately upon interning you are feel relaxed and calmed from the outside bustle of one of Pittsburg's busiest areas. The whiskey selection is one of the best I've ever seen in the United States. It is refreshing to see a bar take so much pride in using fresh and unique additions to craft each drink. I would say if you ever were wondering what the difference between a cocktail and a drink or a mixologist and a barter come here and experience the difference.   The Rabbit Stew and the Filet were both great. Both dishes were extremely tasteful and succulent. It is important to note that the portion size is on the bit of the smaller side so definitely consider getting a couple appetizers before the meal.   Our waiter and staff were very knowledgeable and polite would increased the experience as well.   If you are visiting Pittsburg and looking for a nice bite to eat with some good cocktails look no further",

A reservation is a must and it is a challenge to even pop in for a drink without one. I like the concept and think the whisky wall is neat and trendy, but when you look beyond the smoke and mirrors, you see that the food is good, but not great and realize you have no personal space and are paying a 300% bar markup. The staff here is very pretentious (hipstery kind of pretentious) and they made me feel unwelcome on both visits. Not just your typical 'bad service', but I felt like every staff member I interacted with was borderline hostile.  Some of the food is quite good,  portions can be small for some items and everything I have tried has been SUPER salty (I love salt, so for me to notice added salt means it is over-the-top salty). In my opinion, there are many better options in the area where you can get better food and drink (maybe not better whisky options) minus the attitude and expense.",

Both the reviews and photos compelled me to expect the place to stand out, but unfortunately it fell short. And folks, it fell hard...   Environment The layout of the restaurant is unique. A bar at the entrance is the primary focal point upon walking in and a lengthy staircase leads up to a multi-level dining area for those uninterested in drinks at the bar. It's an after-hours kind of vibe of half-hipster and half-country. It doesn't really find itself fully committed to either aesthetic, unfortunately, and results in what looks like an argument between two generations of owners.  Food This is where Butcher and the Rye was least impressive. Food quality and presentation were both weak. I had ordered the strip steak and one of my friends ordered the rabbit and dumplings. The steak was on the colder side (not the...\"slight cool\" pink you expect from something medium rare) and tasted like it came from your average crockpot stew which is confusing given how well reviewed it was on Yelp. The only highlight of our entire meal was the pumpkin pie dessert which was tasty, warm, and surprisingly fun in flavor. The chocolate cheesecake must have been bought at the local Walmart because it tasted like one of those pre-made desserts you don't really want to buy at the store for your friend's get-together, but you do anyways because it's fast, cheap, and no one will know that you brought it kind of thing.  Drink Selection Let's be honest here...if you're going to so obviously make your bar the focal point of your restaurant, it better rock my socks right off. Butcher's doesn't. It has a surprisingly small list of options and what it does have are seasonally similar.   Overall It's not worth it. There are surely better options in Pittsburgh than this place and the highly acclaimed reviews of it must spawn from entirely different times of day or food selections because they were not remotely close to what one would expect from such a rating for a restaurant. I do get the irony of me saying this, especially given the lengths I've gone in this review to so heavily critique this place, but the word \"pretentious\" comes to mind when witnessing the dining the experience here. It feels like it's pushing itself to be something unique when in reality...it comes up as predictable.",

    "text": "So Butcher and the Rye is of course one of \"those restaurants\" that everyone always talks about and recommends as a \"must\" while in the Pittsburgh area. I have to admit I am always a bit skeptical on the hype that exists over any restaurants but even with this skepticism I was looking forward to the opportunity to dine at this joint. I made my way over on a Tuesday. The interior is broken up into two floors with tables and a bar on the first floor as well as the second floor. I opted to go to the second floor to grab a seat at the bar. The decor is a cool and has a hustle and bustle vibe to it. The first floor has a pretty impressive wall of drinks stacked up against it with a nice chandelier thing hanging.   The few times ive been here, I was always immediately greeted when sitting at the bar and pretty shortly thereafter provided a menu for perusal. They have a pretty solid array of food and drinks so the last few visits have been me asking the bartender for their recommendations for drinks/food. These guys are executing solid cocktails and drinks and were able to meet my random requests for recommendations. After a bit of perusing of the menu, I immediately gravitated towards the pig candy and the dirty pasta based on all the rave reviews. Both were really solid and definitely let me feel I was enjoying the finer cuisine in life. The pig candy is delicious and has the perfect compliments of spices and sweetness to it and is perfectly married with the pork belly. The dirty pasta has the perfect amount of ingredients and is made perfectly as well. It is tossed with ground duck , sage, and pecorino romano making it just heavenly. The noodles were cooked to perfection and I think I literally had to stop myself from licking the plate clean. I have also had the opportunity to try the steak here which was cooked perfectly and delicious with the right amount of tenderness behind it.   All in all, my favorite joint in Pittsburgh so far and definitely a spot that I will try to hit as frequently as possible",

    "text": "Seriously? Most definitely the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh I've been to so far in 2 years. Made my birthday meal the worst experience.   I have NEVER left a restaurant hungry before in my life. I was STARVING and had to go another restaurant right afterwards. My entree was $26 and included a strand of rabbit leg, 2 of the skinniest carrots I've ever seen and a scraping of what I supposed was mashed potato but only left the taste of mashed potato in my mouth. My husband's entree was $30 and he also managed to finish all my pancakes and his own pecan pie at Denny's afterwards.   My husband called a few days before to make reservations. For my birthday. On the night of. The person on the phone said I would get a dessert for free and a candle (okay, w/e about the candle). After we finished our paltry dishes in 3 minutes, the waitress informed us that we misheard and that Butcher and the Rye does not offer anything for free, even for birthdays. The candle is free but we would have to buy the dessert. Yeah, I'll skip s'mores for $10, thanks. I was in such a hungry and bad mood by then, that we hightailed it outta there and ate like real people at Denny's for my FREE birthday meal.   We were seated in this dingy, cramped, wobbly-tableled bistro set right at the stairs. Oh, and it took us 20 minutes to find parking and paid another $8 for 45 minutes. I also regretted that my hubs ordered a $12 stupid cocktail that was of course, half the glass. I just hated that we threw all this money at this place for something that I could have whipped up for a child. I think only a 5 yr old might have been partially full eating what we both ate. I'm so done with uppity downtown restaurants. I'm going to a place where there is parking, comfortable seats, enough lighting to see my food, free bread or something and most importantly, a full sized entree. Please be warned.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh Restaurant Week always encourages me to go out and try a new place that I've been meaning to get to, but just haven't made time for yet.  When my friends and I saw Butcher & the Rye on the list, we made time :)  Walking in you see the rustic yet classy decor - boar's head hanging on the wall mixed with upscale lighting.  I felt like I walked into a HGTV makeover or something - yes, this is a compliment!  I wish I had that kind of style.  We came for the RW menu, but since it was one of the last days of Restaurant Week, they decided to change things up.  We weren't too keen on the new menu they selected (since we already had our meals picked) so we went with plan B - order a bunch of items and share!!  First I need to talk about my drink - Blood & Sand = THANK YOU!!!!!!!  THANK YOU FOR KNOWING HOW TO MAKE THIS DELICIOUS BEVERAGE!!!  (Yes I realize I used all caps.  I would shout this from the rooftops if I could)  Food Time:   My friends and I ordered a bunch of small plates:  PEI MUSSELS $12 red curry / coconut milk / long beans / tomato / lime / cilantro MAC N CHEESE $10 taleggio / fontina / goat cheese / cheddar / Parmesan A homemade bread (sorry can't find it on the website to access ingredients) BEET SALAD 10 goat cheese / croutons / pickled fennel / gem lettuce / pepitas / blood orange dressing.  The mussels were delicious - though I later learned that I (sadly) have an allergy to them.  The Mac N Cheese was, in a word, HEAVENLY!  Creamy and incredibly decadent.  I've tried many Mac N Cheese dishes, but this is the best, thus far.  The bread was warm and fresh with 3 delicious dips - olive, Alfredo, and one other I cannot recall.  Finally my yummy beet salad!  Who would think to turn the goat cheese into little fried cheese balls?  Creative and tasty, but light with a delicious vinaigrette.  For my main dish, I selected the Sea Bass with wasabi mashed - Light and flavorful!  I was pleased with my selection.  I did not want to share my dish with ANYONE.  I kept it to myself.  Before running off to the theater, we decided to end the night with a sweet treat.  My friend and I shared: SUNDAE 8 coconut cream cheese ice cream / carrot cake / compressed pineapple / candied carrot.  Candied carrots?  Why can't all carrots be candied?!?  If they were kids would never have a problem eating their vegetables.  I could have licked this bowl, if I wasn't in public.  The creamy ice cream, the coconut, sweet carrot, moist cake... I'm drooling... I'll stop.  Don't wait until the next restaurant week to visit Butcher and the Rye.  Make the time and visit them this weekend, tonight even.  Your stomach will thank you... unless you're allergic to mussels.  If you are, skip them and order more candied carrots!",

I consider myself a brussel sprout connoisseur. I order them every time I see them on the menu. The sprouts at Butcher and the Rye were the best I've ever had. Served with a spear of flavorful homemade mayo....pure yummmm. Be advised though that 5hey are packed and seating is limited. Be prepared to climb stairs if you don't have a reservation but definately worth the effort. Will be our new \"go to\" when visiting family in \"The Burgh\".   We also tried Sienna at Market Square, which paled in comparison.",

    "text": "Do I dare say that this may be my favorite restaurant of all time?! I know that's quite a claim - particularly for someone with 350 Yelp reviews - but I had a positively dreamy experience at Butcher and the Rye. I would give this place 6 stars here on Yelp if I could.  If you want to dine here at a normal time like a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday between 6-8pm, plan to make reservations far in advance. I made our February 13th reservations for 4 people over a month in advance! If you're currently looking to go on a Friday or Saturday night at 7pm, the next reservations currently available are Friday, April 4th or Saturday, April 19th. Umm.. whoa.  Why is this, you may ask? Well, yes, some of it is because this restaurant is new and popular and trendy. But it's also just THAT GOOD. I'm tempted to go ahead and make reservations for April or May. Let's be real... I'm already ready to go back.  So let's get down to the actual review... I absolutely love the decor. There is a strong and unique and intense theme in this restaurant -- an enormous wall of bourbon/whiskeys, grand chandeliers, luxurious wallpaper, and mounted animal heads. This place leaves a strong impression.  I had heard some negative opinions of the waiters/waitresses at both Butcher and the Rye and its sister restaurant Meat and Potatoes. However, our waiter was fantastic. He was available when needed but not overbearing. He had a great personality and even cracked a funny joke. (I think his name was Scott?)  And now to the food... our group of 4 shared bread, 6 small plates, 3 desserts, and each had a couple drinks. (Just a small note - don't get too committed to the online menu because the actual menu was a little bit different than what is on the website.) We started with the Focaccia Bread, Crispy Pig Wing, Pig Candy, Mac N Cheese, Shishito, Brussels, and Cauliflower. Our waiter did a great job of staggering the plates - bringing out two or three at a time - so our small table wasn't overwhelmed. All of the items were positively delicious, but if I had to choose my three favorites, I'd have to go with the Pig Candy, Mac N Cheese, and Brussels. These three items are the sort of dishes that you'd want to have on your last-meal-on-earth menu.  I broke up these small dishes with two alcoholic drinks - a rum based mixed drink and some sort of special punch. Just know that they were both very tasty, and I greatly appreciated the fact that Butcher and the Rye does not scrimp on the alcohol.  Finally, let's discuss the desserts. I think we all felt a bit silly ordering three, but we couldn't resist trying them. We had the deep fried brownie, pot de creme, and the sticky buns. All three were unique and heavenly! However, if forced to choose, I'd probably have to go with the deep fried brownie... because, well, it's a deep fried brownie.   If you can't tell from this book-long review, I loved this place and can't wait to return! I may need to make my April or May reservations ASAP. :)",

After anxiously awaiting our reservation for upwards of 2 months, the night finally came and I have to say it was well worth the wait and even lived up to the hype.  The restaurant is gorgeous, very gamie, outdoorsy feel to mixed with a almost fine dining decor.   For appetizers we tried the Dry Aged Tartar, this was the best variety of this dish I have truthfully ever come across.  Delightful large pieces of fine quality beef, encrusted with parmesan, black garlic aoli and the best part truffled eggs.  Put it all together on a piece of the texas style toast served with it and you have a melting genius combination that will leave you salvating.  We also really enjoyed their version of Mac & Cheese, the goat cheese was the real standout here.  A sharp variation, creamy and surprisingly complex. For Entrees we tried the Wagyu Flank Steak and Seared Scallops.  I have to admit I am no scallop fan but found this dish to be the better of the two, they were absolutely perfectly prepared with a fantastic crunch to top them off. The Flank Steak was very good but I did feel like I could of picked a better Entree to represent the restaurants diversity and expertise, I just think I picked the wrong dish, nothing more.  I was satisfied but not wowed by this steak, I dont really understand the whole Wagyu craze anyway.I would recommend this restaurant to anybody that liked meat and potatoes and likes to stay some what in American Comfort Food.  However this menu is a bit more exotic than M&P.  Service was excellent and knowledgeable as well.",

The passion behind the design, and the thought about every last detail on the food  and drink shows within everything.    Looking around the restaurant, if you notice the attention to detail that the CHEF (yes the chef apparently is the designer..) has put into the place, you cannot help but admire his artistic abilities.    Every dish was executed great given it was their first week of opening.  Even the most simple things were beyond terrific, and no one should compare this to anything else in Pittsburgh, because it is NOT comparable.  It surpasses everything.

    "text": "I had heard so many great things about this restaurant and therefore decided try during a business trip to Pittsburgh.  The space is very eclectic, but cool.  I was seated upstairs which offered a nice view of the entire restaurant.  I proceeded to order the foccacia bread, the infamous brussel sprouts and mac n' cheese.   The bread arrived first, in loaf form, not what I was expecting, with 3 dips, that didn't really excite me.  The bread was topped with a multitude herbs and it was very,very greasy on the bottom.....I coudn't eat much of it.   The brussel sprouts arrived next.   I LOVE brussel sprouts, but these just didn't do it for me.  The fried sprouts were buried in a cheesy, greasy, vinegary mass.   I could barely taste/find the sprouts.....I didn't finish them.   Last but not least, the mac n' cheese.  The portion was generous, and nicely flavored but I would have preferred it baked versus just heated on the stovetop.   It was just too soupy for me and once again, I couldn't finish it.   I declined dessert, fearing another disappointment.   This place just didn't do it for me, but I can see where other would like it.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the ingredients are fresh and well selected.",

When we couldn't decide on a bottle of wine so he  brought us a sample of one we were thinking of in order to make sure we would like it.  We ordered the artisanal cheese plate to enjoy with our wine and it was exceptional. The mushroom soup is poured table side and was incredible. My husband had the short ribs which literally fell off the bones as he was eating them. I had the scallops and blue crab risotto. Both were amazing and I would highly recommend both of them.  The atmosphere and service here was fantastic!!",

    "text": "After the Ben Folds/Pittsburgh symphony concert in mid June myself, my boyfriend, and his friend headed over to Butcher and the Rye-directly across the street from Heinz Hall. I had made 10:15 reservations for 4 (according to open table that was the earliest they could seat a 4 top) and it worked out well because the show was over at 10. Although we became a party of 3, they easily accommodated us and we were seated directly beneath the antler chandelier. We all loved the rustic decor and the bourbon/whiskey wall behind the bar was very cool. We did not get a chance to go upstairs but I could see it somewhat and it looked mostly the same as the downstairs. We were greeted quickly, our drinks took longer than we'd have liked but the quality of the 2 cocktails quickly made up for that . We ordered a dogfishhead 60 minute, a manhattan, and a butcher sour (my drink of choice). The cocktail I enjoyed was nicely handcrafted and the manhattan was described as \"aces\"-so this is an excellent place to grab a unique cocktail. The features they had last night looked delicious (a burger with pork belly, a hangar steak with frites, a squash tasting, and a pasta) however we were told that they were out of all of the features. The three of us started with the pig candy-\"pork belly / apple kim chi / miso caramel / cilantro\"-it was very tasty but not enough for three people so I only had a small bite and let the other 2 in my party eat most of it. As for entrees, the pappardelle (braised rabbit / carrots / tomato / celery / parmesan), the shepherd's pie (braised beef cheeks / creamed peas / carrots / bacon / potato foam), and the mac and cheese off of the small plate menu (taleggio / fontina / goat cheese / cheddar / parmesan). I did not try the pappardelle but that is what I would have ordered had I not ordered the mac and cheese. I was told it was well cooked with large noodles. I tried a bite of the shepherd's pie-the beef cheeks were excellent and the potato foam was like nothing I had tasted before. it was more of a deconstructed shepherd's pie with the potato foam covering the dish. The mac and cheese was off the charts yummy! It was very creamy and rich and was the perfect size to finish on my own. The top was toasted nicely and the crunchiness naturally meshed nicely with the creaminess of the cheese. It is rather hard to get reservations here but it was well worth it and I'd love to go back and try the Butcher's Bride cocktail and the pappardelle. Hopefully a return trip won't be too far in the future!",

    "text": "i've been here twice and i really wish they weren't always full to the brim with reservations and not even any room at the bar because i'd love to go back more. being sisters with meat and potatoes, they are very similar in \"prohibition style drinks\" and \"fancy tapas\". fancy tapas, by the way, are what i call the dishes, i'm sure they have a much better term to describe them. so, let me explain what you have to look forward to. the restaurant is rather big, but there isn't a lot of space, surprisingly. there can't be more than 15 seats at the bar, if there are even that many. there is a small bar section across from the bar where you are still sitting at stools but you just have a ledge to eat on against a wall. there are two floors, but it always seems like you're squeezing your way through to get anywhere. there is a second, smaller, bar upstairs as well. so in other words, you NEED TO MAKE A RESERVATION if you want a table or have a party larger than 2 or 3. next, let's talk decor. i LOVE the way the place is decorated. someone described it to me as being inside a wes anderson movie and i think that's a perfect description. rustic punk is another way i've described it before. and oh, that wall of whiskeys... so now let's talk drinks. prohibition style (i still don't think i know exactly what that means, but it gives me an idea of what to expect). they concentrate on whiskey but have plenty of other cocktails, a punch of the day, and a decent beer selection. last time i went i had the butcher's bride and it was great. ok, now food. when i say fancy tapas, what i mean is delicacies in small portions. the menu is separated into bread (foccaccia with bean spread, olive tepenade, and whipped parmesan for us. amazing), flatbreads, charcuterie, cheese, small plates, large plates, and desserts. almost exactly like meat and potatoes, and the items themselves are similar, although i believe butcher's menu is slightly smaller. this visit, we split the bread, pork candy (if you like bacon at all, i highly recommend), and skirt steak (i still don't know what the sides were but i loved them). i've still not made it to dessert here yet, but the smores sound yummy. finally, price. of course the place is expensive because they're fancy, serve fancy food, and super popular right now. but honestly, it's worth every penny.",

    "text": "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh...  My partner and four other friends treated me to a birthday dinner here on a Friday night in February. The place was packed, but fortunately, we had a reservation called in two or three days ahead of time. We were a table or two away from the bar, right in front of the window. I'm not a fan of places where there's no way to hear what your mates are saying-- I love a deep, thoughtful conversation, and while we had to raise our voices and repeat stuff here and there, the din of the bar didn't greatly inhibit our interaction.   For being jam packed on Friday night, wait times for food and drinks were reasonable. We ordered a bunch of small plates rather than individual entrees and our personable waiter came back often to ensure we had a great experience. The beer and cocktails were top-notch, as one would expect them to be for a place whose name ends in \"rye,\" which they have myriad types of. The Manhattan is made with a Buffalo Trace bourbon, and yeah, to me, $12 is kinda steep, but between Butcher and its sister restaurant, Meat & Potatoes, I've ordered it on multiple occasions and will continue to do so. My partner enjoyed her Pink Elephant as well.  I'm not an interior designer, so decor doesn't add or detract too much from my experience unless it's godawful. Butcher's layout and design is refined rustic that doesn't take itself too seriously, but at the same time avoids being kitschy.   The food was par excellence for upscale, contemporary American in Pittsburgh, and I'd be proud to line it up against other iterations in larger cities. The menu is cohesive, but also achieves breadth. Our group had the PEI mussels, marrow, brussels, pig candy, country ham and dry aged tartare. For dessert: the deep fried brownie and baked camembert. Take a look at the menu on the website- the flavor combinations will impress you and do more justice than I could hope to.   I'm unable to register any complaints regarding the food, and by extension, the entire establishment. I look forward to heading their again and giving their large plates a try next go around. This place is certainly worth the splurge.",

    "text": "One of my best meals. We ended up upstairs at the bar since they were so crowded the night we went. Full menu is available. Great environment and decor. Feels very old timey, like you are in the 30s, but perhaps more noir. The bartenders really know what they are doing. We could not stop ordering drinks, because we kept wanting to try another one. Definitely a place to hit up if you like bourbon cocktails. TFT bone marrow appetizer may be in the top 10 things I have eaten in my life. Do not miss out on that. Will absolutely come here again. This will be on my regular rotation when I am in town.",

    "text": "As advertised!!!! A friend of mine booked these reservations and I was a little skeptical at first.  I am not a fan of random types of meat (duck, rabbit, liver, etc.) and honestly didn't know what I would eat there.  My wife also doesn't eat meat so it appeared that it would be quite a challenge.  We couldn't be more wrong.  The first impression when you walk in is a massive whiskey wall behind the bar (which is heaven to me) and the uber cool ambience.  It could only be described as a mix between rustic and industrial.  I recommend taking a look at all the cool features located around the restaurant.  The light fixtures were all different and very, very cool.  We sat on the 2nd floor at a table that consisted of a leather riveted coach and a short table (height-wise).  We sat next to the 2nd floor bar which is also cool, consisting of subway tile.  The crowd is a mix of hipsters and young business people.  The whisky list is extensive, and I was able to get one of my favorites, Balvenie 14.  We started out with a charcuterie board, brussel sprouts, and mac and cheese, all top notch.  They also have daily specials and I was able to get a seafood dish that consisted of shrimp, mussels, scallops, and clams in an awesome sauce and a some big pieces of italian bread on the side.  Really, really good for a \"meat\" place.  My wife got salmon and she loved it.  I also got a coffee and a fried apple pie for dessert (a+++++!!!).  I would go back here in a heartbeat next time I go to Pittsburgh.",

We took a 5PM seating  time to leave plenty of time before a show. There was a line out the entrance before the restaurant even opened at 5. Once the doors opened, patrons were seated quickly and our waitress was available almost immediately. I tried the Brussel sprouts (small plate) and the pork wing. The pork wing is not large but is very rich. I ended up sharing. The portion of brussel sprouts was also large enough to share. The food is delicious but the price range makes this a special occasion place.",

    "text": "Butcher and the Rye's got that upscale Gaston's tavern feel to it.  We made reservation ahead of time and got a text from their hostess 10 minutes prior to let us know our table was ready.  I'm new to Pittsburgh so I wasn't sure how wait time is but reservation is the way to go.  Downtown restaurants are crawling with people dining from 6 - 8 PM.  We've had a few drinks before dinner so the first thing we ordered was the bread (Mmmm carbs).  It's paired with an herb butter spread and gravy.  Aside from the need of carbs, I enjoyed it.  For appetizers, we ordered the tartare and the pig candy.  The beef tartare was spread on top of a toasted bread (yes, more carbs) and we loved the truffle aloli poached egg yolk on the side.  It's likely to inspire many of our homemade eggs now.  The pig candy, which is a chunk of pork belly, was less inspiring.  However, It was sweet, saucy, and meaty.  For the main course of the night, we shared the pappardelle with pork and lobster.  This sealed the night for me as I enjoyed everything from the grounded pork to the bite-sized (although I wouldn't mind bigger pieces personally) lobster tail to the pappardelle to the sauce!  The sauce was better than I expected for a pasta dish.  We ended the night with the doughnuts. Expect cinnamon and happiness.",

    "text": "3 1/2 *s.  This is a tough one because Butcher and the Rye is a really cool place and deserves high marks for many reasons but unfortunately there were a few miss steps which prevent me from giving it the full four.  I have to say I loved the interior and design, it was definitely a popular, vibrant, lively and busy place.  It felt like I was at the place to be.     Where the restaurant fell down was firstly the lounge seating we were placed at, the low seats while comfortable for lounging and drinks weren't very comfortable for eating with a knife and fork.  Low to the ground and without much back support it seemed like an afterthought as additional seating for the overflow of diners.  Set on the upper floor in a dark back corner, although the service was just as good, I would much rather have been at a proper dining table and chairs.    The recommendation of lamb neck main was extremely disappointing with the best part of the dish being the beans.  No flavor whatsoever, yes, the meat was fall off the bone and tender but it was heavy, tasteless and fatty - I felt as if I was eating a mound of lard and concluded why I'd never seen lamb \"neck\" on a menu before.  Also, beware of what the waiter gushes about, this main instead of being the highlight of our dinner turned out to be the restaurant's downfall.  The service was excellent (except for the lamb recommendation), drinks were excellent and when my husband ordered something he didn't like the waiter was more than happy to change it - I think this compensated for the poor lamb recommendation.  Overall our appetizers, drinks, ambience and service were all solid.  Yes, if you're in Pittsburgh and want a good restaurant to try \"go\" but beware on the lamb neck (you don't need to be there for a bland piece of fatty meat - maybe they forgot to season it).",

    "text": "Overall a good experience, but definitely over-hyped here in Pittsburgh. Great service, immense selection of booze, and wonderful atmosphere/decor/vibe.  The whiskey selection is second to none in the city, and while pricing is ambitious, it was great to try a few things I have been wanting for a long time.  Unfortunately, the food was not up to par to the hype or the pricing. For a place with \"butcher\" right in the name, the meats selection is just not there. The entrees just failed to impress. While I strongly prefer quality over quantity, the quality was just not there to justify the tiny portions we received.   I had the scallops since again, there wasn't much from the butcher, and the ingredients sounded enticing. What I received was 3 small overcooked scallops on a bed of over-salted risotto. It was hard to judge the flavor of the risotto due to the salt. I forget what vegetable was served, but I remember it was burned.The risotto was cooked well though, texture-wise.  My date had the roasted chicken. Again, enticing description, but over-salted. Fortunately the salt was not so extreme so the flavor came through and it was pretty good and the chicken was cooked nicely. Again, tiny portion. I have never seen my date finish an entree and she finally finished one here.  We definitely had room for dessert, but based on the entrees, we decided to skip that.  I will wrap up on a positive note: the appetizers. We ordered the tartar and the rabbit rillette, and both were just to die for. It's the first time I had an appetizer in Pittsburgh that did what it's supposed to do - it made me look forward to the rest of dinner.",

    "text": "I went here over the weekend with some friends to celebrate a friend's new job. I had never been, but heard a lot of good things, and was excited to try it out.  My husband and I arrived before our friends and before our table was ready (we had a reservation), so we headed to the bar to get some drinks They have this bar that you can sit at that's actually across from the real bar. I assumed that we would have to go stand at the bar to order our drinks, but someone came to us with menus and served us from there. It seems minor, but it was a nice touch.  Once our friends arrived and our table was ready, we were seated. Our table was upstairs. I love the atmosphere inside! It's very unique and interesting.  We ordered some bread for the table. The sourdough was delicious, as were the dipping sauces they provided. I ordered the mac n cheese as well as their seasonal salad (which was a potato salad) for my entree. I am a vegetarian and they didn't have a ton of options, but I have to say that what I did order was awesome. I was uneasy about the potato salad because I don't love mayo and was envisioning typical American potato salad, but this was very different. I don't think there was any mayo in it. It was awesome. And the mac n cheese was great - I loved all the breading on top. It was also extremely filling - I was only able to eat about half.  I knocked off a star for a few reasons: one, I wish they had more veggie options. I know that it's literally called \"butcher in the rye\", but still. Would have been nice. Also, we were seated upstairs and it was HOT. It was a hot day outside and it seemed like the AC didn't push upstairs. And lastly, the lounge style seating up there is cool, but a little uncomfortable. There's no back support, which can get uncomfortable after a long meal.  All in all, I loved it and will definitely return.",

I went with the wagyu burger and hubs went with the steak dish, which was sadly a little disappointing. The meat was not very flavorful at all, but the accompanying carrot wellington was delish. My burger was good, but not great - it was hot and juicy and well cooked. There was a lot of bread more than burger and it was just OK in flavor. I was really expecting to be wow-ed by it, but sadly was let down a bit.

This is now our favorite special occasion restaurant.   Arriving early for our reservation, we checked in and had a seat at the 1st floor bar. The bartender was welcoming despite it being a busy night. Their cocktail menu is impressive and it's a treat to watch the expert bartenders create them. I ordered the Wild Kind... made with Old Forester burbon, honey, ginger, lemon. This spot at the bar is an experience itself! The 2 story shelf of liquor behind the bar is a sight to behold.   We were seated upstairs for dinner in a tight row of tables with a bench against the wall and chairs on the other side. We were separate but very close to our neighbors. Our waitress was lovely...helpful and friendly.  If you eat nothing else ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE!  We're so glad we did! So flavorful! I could have stopped the evening there and been satisfied. For dinner I ordered the scallops. It comes with blue cheese risotto, asparagus and mushrooms. Delicious. Perfectly cooked.",

Not in a bad way either - these drinks are finely balanced but they do not skimp on the alcohol, which I appreciate.  The service is also fantastic.  I've never had dessert but appetizers and entrees are excellent - standouts are the Brussels sprouts and the scallop.  Go here on date night.  You won't regret it.

I've been to similar restaurants with fantastic veggie options so I was optimistic. That faded quickly. The food, overall, was very underwhelming. The only vegetarian options were on the small plates menu. The brussels (vegetarian without the parmesan) were flavorful but completely drenched in oil. The cauliflower was slightly better but had an overbearing taste of lime. I would not recommend either. However, the night was saved by the amazing chocolate banana cake.  Since it's usually busy in the evenings, service was very slow - both the wait staff and the kitchen. We had a reservation for 7:30pm but was not actually seated until closer to 8pm. It then took another hour for us to get our food.",

We started with a few cocktails (all delicious) the beef tartare and the scallops (large plate). Both were incredibly delicious but expensive for the size in my opinion - ESPECIALLY the scallops - only 3 big scallops for $33! Honestly I was a little disappointed but then our second round of dishes came out - the Sunday Gravy was outstanding, a little salty but so comforting and hearty. The absolute star of the show was the Dirty Pasta - best pasta I've ever eaten in my life and my favorite dish of the night, high praise from someone who generally goes out of their way NOT to order pasta at restaurants. Overall a great meal and loved the vibe of the restaurant as well.",

Last time we got the burger and chicken, which were both fantastic. This time, we had the rabbit, scallops, and halibut. Each was presented beautifully and tasted just as great as it looked. They also have a wide variety of drinks from specialty cocktails to wine (by the glass or bottle) and beer. The decor is eclectic and trendy, with a main level, as well as additional seating upstairs. They do get very busy, though, so reservations are definitely recommended, but it is so worth it! The service has been fantastic both time we've been there, too. The servers are very attentive and make sure your drinks are filled and everything is to your liking. The location is also very convenient if you're going to a show - right across the street from Heinz Hall.",

My partner had roast chicken stuffed with mushrooms and more chicken under the skin (druxelle). It was quite good.  Drinks - if you like bourbon, you absolutely must go here. The list is extensive and has many rare options. The lions tail cocktail is done well (though Tender's is better).   Service - exceptional.   Ambiance - intimate upstairs, social downstairs   So, get yourselves a reservation here and enjoy!",

When you walk in, the place seems small and tight but there are multiple sections on different levels. I felt Meat & Potatoes was very cramped but this layout was better. There are two bars, one upstairs and one down. It appears that you can eat your meal there and the bar upstairs was less crowded.   We ordered three appetizers. The focaccia came out very quickly with three spreads of olive tapenade, ricotta cream and white bean spread - all were very good. We had the Shisito peppers which were ok but I prefer the eones from Soba. Lastly, since we pigged out we had the pig candy which was very good and not super fatty.   For dinner we ordered the flank steak rare and it was cooked perfectly. We also ordered the dirty pasta and it was nice and rich. I did feel that the pasta was missing a little something so I took the leftovers home and added a little salt, pepper and a dash of hot sauce. I think that a squeeze of lemon may have even given it a light flavor.",

We walked in with no reservations and were happy to get table upfront. We decided to order a couple of things and share. We started with the bread order and the gravy that came with it was delicious. Next up was the bone marrow,  I will preface I've never had bone marrow before. I thought I might as well try it in a place that people rave about it but it just wasn't my thing. Next was the pig candy which was different and tasty, I really enjoyed the side salad that accompanies it. We ended with the skirt steak which was delicious but a relatively small portion in my opinion.  The one thing that did ruin our experience was that we found the restaurant really hot. We were seated right at the front by the windows on a really hot day and found ourselves wanting to get out of there as quick as possible so we headed elsewhere to get get desert to cool down.   As an aside we went with two children and found limited options for kids, there was a burger special that they went for. Not a deal breaker and the main clientele but thought I'd pass along to other parents out there.",

I ordered the dirty pasta which had mashed up duck and noodles. Absolutely delicious, highly recommended. My fiance ordered the rabbit which I have never had before, very unique and delicious.

The section that we were placed in had a banquet on one side and a small stool of the other side. I was so uncomfortable sitting on a stool with no back and that was too low for my longer legs. The area could have been designed to be appropriately comfortable, but perhaps not as edgy-looking. Second, when a busboy was cleaning off a table next to us, he sprayed cleaning product in our direction. I could see it misting my food and drink. Luckily, I was a few bites away from done because that was the end of the meal for me. Hopefully, someone in charge will read this and instruct their staff to spray their cloth while turning away from diners and then wipe down tables, in order to avoid lemon-chemical-coated entrees.",

It was garnished with two different garnished that were refreshingly light. My wife enjoyed both her Brussel sprouts and Hanger Steak.  For desert we shared the strawberry pie. I would go back just for this alone. Kudos on the coffee. Nothing worse than having a great meal then finishing it off with a bad Cup of Joe. 5 stars all the way!

Finally made it for dinner last night and it (mostly) lived up to very high expectations.    Sat upstairs at a two-top with very low, but quite comfortable leather chairs.  Started with two gin-based cocktails -- the Bramble and Bee's Knees -- that were both outstanding.  Fewer gin cocktails on this brown liquor-focused menu, but they were both perfectly balanced.  For food, started with the artisan cheeseboard, which was just right to whet the palate, and particularly enjoyed the blue cheese and cute little square of honeycomb.  Shared 5 small plates after that--the crispy octopus (a special), the brussels sprouts, the bone marrow, the pig candy, and the mac and cheese. The crispy octopus was delicious, with fried panisse, chick peaks, and a lemon emulsion. Only minor disappointment was that there was only one small tentacle. At the $18 (I think) price point, might expect more (especially since the sister restaurant TAKO next door is so much more generous with the octopus on their tacos).  Brussels were great, with generous parmigiano reggiano and lemon aioli, and not as sweet as other versions around.  The pig candy (pork belly) was delicious, if just a little tough, and I wished the kimchi had a little more bite.  Bone marrow also rich and tasty, although I wanted an actual parsley salad (really just a few chopped leaves and red onion scattered on top) and definitely more grilled bread. Oddly, there was just one slice of grilled bread, so we ordered more to soak up every luscious drop of the marrow.  Finally, the mac and cheese was perfect--brown and crispy on top, rich and creamy beneath.  Service was friendly and mostly attentive, and ambiance was laid-back but classy.  Thumbs up all around.",

    "text": "Very good and interesting place.  The menu is right-sized, with a handful of starters, salads, small plates, and large plates.  Here's what I really liked:  - Kale Caesar Salad - the kale is slightly wilted, as it should be, so it is not too tough for this type of salad.  They must make their own dressing; it was excellent, and the giant croutons were great, too.  - Mac & Cheese Small Plate - OMG, you've got to get this.  It's just enough to share with a table of four.  There is nothing overtly unusual about this rendition of the classic, but it is just excellent.  - Wagyu Flank Steak - So flavorful (as flank steak should be), and somehow not tough like a flank usually is if it is not marinated, and this did not taste marinated.  The mix of veggies under the steak were really flavorful and added to the dish (little potatoes, green peppers, maybe some onions, some kind of sauce that was the consistency of gravy, but a bit sour, almost like mustard - whatever it was, it worked).  - The Setting - The room we were in (pretty much straight back and to the right of the hostess stand) was small and intimate, but had a very high ceiling.  There is rough-hewn wooden planks on one or two walls, and very loungey, dark, velvet wallpaper on the back wall.  The chandelier is made of one hundred deer antlers.  - Service - Just right, not pretentious, just helpful, fairly attentive, and knowledgeable.  I always like it when the server is genuinely enthused about the items on the menu.  So this place lives up to the hype, but in a lower-key way than I expected, which is good with me.",

I've been here several times and always take friends and family who are visiting here. My recommendations: pig wing, Brussel sprouts, Sunday gravy, and you MUST get the dirty pasta. It will be life changing. Their drinks are also top notch. Service is always impeccable. The prices are also very reasonable. Overall, it's a fantastic establishment serving new American cuisine that is cooked to perfection.",

The second floor bar is a great place to lounge and enjoy a verity of small plates and appetizers as well as expertly crafted cocktails. The bourbon selection can be browsed on an iPad offered by the bar tenders if you can't make out the bottles on the wall. If your passing through town this is one of the best spots Pittsburgh has to offer, make sure to make the stop.",

    "text": "Totally disappointing experience at Butcher last night.  Stopped by for a few cocktails with coworkers prior to a formal event at the Fairmont and were met with fairly rude and somewhat snooty bar staff and host.  Were brusquely told by the host we could not stand at the upstairs bar that we had to sit even though all of the seating area adjacent was completely empty.  One of our folks who came late was told she couldn't even come upstairs because it was too full.  Again, even thought the entire adjacent seating area was completely empty.  I love a good cocktail and Butcher makes some of the best.  And the guy mixing the drinks upstairs was great.  However, there a many other bars downtown that mix a great drink.  Won't be spending any more of my or my businesses money at Butcher after this experience.  Try Poros, Seina or Pizzaiolo Primo instead.",

The menu had a lot of variety. I was impressed.  Terrific cocktail menu as well.    Unfortunately,  The small plates that we ordered did not impress. The brussels sprouts were soaked in oil and served with mayonnaise. Way too heavy!  The mussels were tasty but they were too many flavors going on  at the same time. The pig wing was good but quite small . The octopus special was nothing special.   It was served with a chickpea relish and a fried chickpea  fritter that was pretty good but again did not showcase the octopus very much.    After splitting four small plates, I was so full that I could not try anything else. I would however consider going back in trying some other things on the menu. If you like extremely heavy food you may like it better than I did.",

    "text": "This is a True gastropub. So many places call themselves a (British) gastropub and justify it by placing something slightly English on the menu - Shepherd's Pie. That's what I was expecting here. This place however took the \"high-end\" part of the gastropub definition to heart.   First off I was happy to see the kitchen was open to 12am. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and was expecting the traditional ground beef and veg under a crusty layer of mashed potatoes. Instead! Instead I got what appeared to be liquid potatoes - the menu called it potato foam! Under and throughout that there were peas, carrots, and braised beef. It was delicious!! And slightly minty... I absolutely loved this dish and it's the most unique, most untraditional, Shepherd's Pie I have ever had ($20 and worth it).   They also put a spin on the typical Moscow Mule. They serve that, but also serve a Naut-Mule ($10). It's based with the traditional Tito's Vodka and ginger beer, but includes fresh Jalapeno! The kick was refreshing, but not overpowering.   The atmosphere is super cool as well. I loved the backlit bar with counter to ceiling shelves of bottles. They have a moving ladder like in an old fashioned library to slide along the rear bar to get bottles down. There's an upstairs dining area as well as a small section in the back which is decorated like a modern hunting lodge - there's a big antler chandelier and mounted moose/deer heads surrounding wooden white chairs and velvety wall paper.   So unique. So good! Parking garage right around the corner.",

The atmosphere had a western feel with a modern twist. It was adorned with a deer antler chandelier, fun lights near the bar area, and wallpaper that went oddly well with the wood walls.  They also got rid of those weird bathroom stalls, so now you can go to the bathroom without having to make eye contact with the person who's washing their hands.  A few of my favorite plates here are the Pig Candy and the Dirty Pasta. The cocktails are good too, but don't get them if you're only into fruity/sweet drinks like I am.   Overall, 5/5 would recommend to a friend and will keep coming back.",

The drinks were amazing and I had the ' Rose all day' and my  husband had the ' bobby burns ' We loved those drinks. Then the food came and we ordered 4 plates to share from the specials. The octopus was chewy and the mushrooms were too salty. The bread, pork and spala was good but could be better. The  server was very polite and paid attention to the details. The dessert, the flourless chocolate cake was amazing and the coffee was ok. The four stars is because of the food and ventilation and  the smell of food  on my clothes  after I left the restaurant. I may go back but most likely I will only visit for drinks.",

It was awesome! For our main course I had the burger. It was amazing. Their bar selection, especially their bourbon selection is second to no one. I had a couple of Cosmopolitans and it was one of the only places that makes them the right way, not too sweet. The decor is very eclectic.... hunting lodge meets escape room tourist trap. Highly recommend when in Pittsburgh!",

If you're all about trying new foods with different flavors and cooked in styles you might not be used to, definitely check out Butcher & The Rye.   I'm not usually a fan of tartare, but after hearing great reviews, I had to try it. I still don't love the stuff, but the dry aged tartare was packed with flavor and was served with great presentation. I also tried to fried rabbit and surprisingly enough, it was pretty darn good! The way they cook the food takes away from the fact that you're eating things that are very rarely on other menus!  I had the Forgive and Fernet cocktail - because any drink with gin in it is my kind of drink -  and it was awesome. I didn't even know what half the ingredients were, but it had me at tanqueray and the rest meshed perfectly with the gin. Definitely worth trying!",

There was also a hint of fennel in there that I wasn't expecting. It was a pleasant surprise. It was delicious. The atmosphere is great too. The tables aren't too close together and there is plenty of seating. It is a little pricey, however the quality is great and I don't think there is anywhere else in Pittsburgh you can get the same thing for a cheaper price. The menus are perfectly curated to complement each other. My ONLY beef with the place is the name. I know it's supposed to be a play on Catcher in the Rye so why not call it Butcher in the Rye instead of \"and the\"? I don't know. That's just me.",

I can't think of a single complaint. It was a beautiful day so we got to sit outside at a little table and enjoy the city. The waiter was super patient and helpful. He helped us pick out a drink and made suggestions as well. Both of us absolutely loved our Old Fashioned. The restaurant itself is a little dark but I think that gives it a nice ambience.  But my absolute favorite part was the scallops. OMG AMAZING. Scallops is something that can be so easily screwed up. It's fairly simple to make them but if you screw up that flavor you basically just served someone little balls of rubber and no one wants that. These scallops were phenomenal though. The flavor was perfect paired with the risotto. I almost wished I had ordered another one to take home with me.  If you have not been to Butcher and the Rye yet I strongly suggest you make it a point to get there relatively soon. I promise you won't be disappointed. Just writing this review makes me want to text one of my friends and ask them to go back with me. Absolutely spot on, good job!",

The drinks were delicious (solid 4), the brussels sprouts and lemon aioli were amazing (5 stars), and the beet salad was good with the goat cheese balls being an awesome touch (4 stars).   Unfortunately I did not like my main dish, the ricotta and charred carrot cavatelli with veal, peas, and hazelnut. In my opinion, the flavors did not work well together. The pasta was slightly overcooked and pea flavor consumed the dish.   The service could also be improved. The waiter was not very friendly or informative. The entire upstairs was open and yet we ended up sitting right on top of another group. I don't mind crowded places, but when the upstairs was so open, it was hard to focus on something other than the neighboring conversation. The woman who brought out our pasta to the table apologized for the \"mixup with the dish\", but we weren't aware of this mixup so we were confused.  While it wasn't a completely unpleasant experience, I'd much rather go back to their sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes.",

I can see it being one of the more popular downtown Pittsburgh places... it has a fun vibe.  One thing I noticed when we arrived was that the restaurant was only 75% filled but there's no reservations left available online.  So for anyone thinking there's no seating even on a Friday night, you probably would be pleasantly surprised if you called in to see if there is a table available.  When you walk in, you immediately notice the bar area and the incredibly huge wall of bottles.  There's 3 levels to the restaurant and each level and spot has an unique and arresting visual to keep you looking around.  You can spot the large antler chandelier or tall standing bear or even the head of a pig.  Think of it as a hunter's man cave who happens to like their rye... correction: LOVES their rye.  Possibly bathes in it.  The staff here is friendly and informative of all items on the menu.  It was recommended to look at the menu as a sharing plate style and to have a few small plates and one or two large plates depending on how starved we are.  We ended up ordering their special crispy octopus, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and dirty pasta.    Crispy Octopus - It was offered on their special menu and seeing how I will miss the Tako octopus, this sounded like a good option.  It came with two medium sized tentacles with a nice crispy shell on it.  It was pretty easy to cut through with the butter knife and it was nicely tender.  The sides that came with it had great texture.... crispy shell covering a tender creamy block, soft chick peas, and perhaps a wilted grilled leek.  Compared to the octopus, i found the sides to be quite light on flavour and underseasoned.  The leek or spring onion had flavour but the creamy block (polenta?) had very little flavour.  I think the octopus was very good but the sides kinda left the dish a little underwhelming.  3.5/5 (4 for the octopus though!)  Brussel Sprouts - Super deep bronzed crispy sprouts were under a mountain of Parmesan cheese and dill.  There was an aioli on the bottom that was supposedly flavoured with lemon.  This was another great textural dish but could be seasoned a bit more. Even the parmesean didn't quite save the dish from being light on flavour.  3.5/5  Cauliflower - This looked super spicy as it arrived with a nice red colour but there wasn't any heat to it once you took a bite.  The cauliflower was crispy and was accompanied with farro grains, pine nuts, and a smear of harrisa.  Overall, I loved how you got crunch, crispy bit, and a tender cauli.  I wish the harissa was a bit stronger as I found the flavour not very strong.  3.5/5  Dirty Pasta - Al dente long open tubes pasta carrying a rich sauce of pecorino, ground duck, and finely diced carrots.  The sauce was very rich texture and lovely but opposite of the previous 3 dishes, it was incredibly salty.  I'm not sure if all the salt arrived from the other 3 dishes or the pecorino was heavy handed.  3/5  Overall, the service was good and had a great atmosphere.  Just unfortunately the dishes and kitchen wasnt quite wowing us.  The other odd thing was that they delivered all 3 small plates within minutes of each other and we didnt have any room for the 3rd plate.  They had to remove our drinks to fit it.  So I wish I could say its a 4 stars but not quite for us this time.",

I've had two excellent dinners at Butcher and the Rye and I cannot wait to go back.   I've had tastes of their bar and seafood and meat dishes and everything has been well thought out for the foodie minded and also just fun. I think they take the best of rustic presentation giving each dish a home-style feel but crafting some excellent high-level flavors and eating experiences consistently. This goes for their drinks as well. Cocktails can get pricey but have consistently pleased.   When full it is a noisy place so try to get upstairs if you can which is quieter. Low chance of walk-in seating on a busy night so try and reserve in advance. They will also accommodate you for a pre-show dinner on nights of major shows and concerts.   I honestly can't think of a negative for this place.",

The first time we attempted to go we were just trying to stop for a drink at the bar but the host told me they were too busy to even let us stand over there with our drinks so we left-- we never even made it past the hostess stand. After hearing rave reviews about the food we decided to try again but make a reservation and sit at a table. When we walked in, a male employee rolled his eyes at us and acted as though he was much too busy to even greet us. The hostess asked him if he would like to seat us and he didn't even look up and said she should do it in what I thought to be a rude tone. I made a joke to the girl seating us for them to not all jump at once to show us to our table. She apologized for him twice. I was on a date with my fiance so I let it roll off, but she shouldn't have to apologize for anyone else's actions. To my surprise, that same rude gentleman named Evan ended up being our server. Why would you greet (or lack of greeting at all) guests so rudely at the front door if they could potentially be a table you wait on? Both myself and my fiance do and have worked in service in the past. I even managed a restaurant a few years back and I can't even imagine one of my employees being so rude. The whole time he waited on us I felt like his personality was extremely fake because he wanted to save face and hopefully get a nice tip. We did still tip him over 20% because the food was great and to be honest if he doesn't change his attitude he will most likely be looking for work and may need the few extra bucks to get by.",

We ordered three appetizers for the table to share. All of them were fantastic. We had the rustic sourdough bread that is served with a homemade butter and a delicious pan gravy that is absolutely delicious for dipping!! We also had the pig candy, which was a piece of perfectly cooked pork belly garnished with pickled veggies, radishes, and cilantro. Another favorite!! So much flavor and depth. But, I must saw my favorite appetizer was the brussel sprouts. They were cooked so well, with an extremely charred and crispy texture and were served with a lemon aioli which was incredible!! They are like no Brussel sprouts you've ever had before, and you may not try them that good again in your lifetime. AMAZING!! For dinner, I had the chicken, which was so tender and juicy, unlike most chicken at other restaurants. It was served on a bed of creamed brussel sprouts with sauteed mushrooms and roasted grapes, which added a lovely sweet flavor. Wonderful dish! The guests I dined with had the scallops, which were pan seared and served over a bed of blue crab risotto (so rich and perfect), with crispy kale and capers!! AWESOME! We also had the special, a smoked duck bolognese. A rich, fun rendition of a traditional bolognese with duck, and bursts of pomegranate seeds for awesome flavor. Along with our amazing cocktail, a nauti-mule (a regular moscow mule sciped up with jalapeno), it was a fantastic evening with great service and an awesome atmosphere!!! Definitely would go again, and bring friends as well! Great job!",

In fact, on two to three night trips, I have been known to go there each night (I see no need to venture out of downtown anymore with M&P right next to the Fairmont).  Butcher in the Rye is another excellent addition to downtown Pittsburgh. I ordered the flank steak and the mac and cheese - both were phenomenal. The steak was cooked perfectly with great flavor combinations of roasted garlic, potatoes,  liver pate, and some sort of delicious cheese. The mac and cheese was everything you would hope it would be.  It's a bit louder and a bit more expensive than M&P, but well worth it in my opinion.  I'll be back often!",

That's not saying that the food was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.    I do have to mention that it's worth checking out for the unique interior / atmosphere alone.  I would describe it as cross between a hunting lodge and a 1920's speakeasy.  Definitely dug the vibe of this place.  The food was pretty good too. I would eat here again, but I don't think the hype and reservation wait  is worth it.  Drinks and appetizers at the bar would be more warranted.",

I ended up with a scotch based drink while in a bourbon bar, oh well, moving on.     Started off with the bone marrow, while it was delicious, the star of this dish I believe is the Oxtail Jam.  I almost didn't even want the bone marrow, just the bread with that jam.  It was amazing, seriously.  For my main course I had the Waygu Flank Steak and it was delicious as well.  Was cooked perfectly, the potatoes and aioli really completed the dish.  Had to get dessert, right?  Went with the fried brownie.  While I would've liked more ice cream to have a better brownie/ice cream ratio, is a small complaint.    Bottom line, make the reservations for whenever you can and go.

    "text": "Atmosphere is decent -- decor is a mix of baroque & game hunting lodge, which sounds strange, but kind of works in a bizarre way.  Appetizers got me super excited because they were creative twists on staples... Brussel sprouts with a bit of sour cream was heavenly, crispy octopus was tasty, and shishito peppers was a creative delicious version vs how they're served in so many other places.  But then the big plates arrived and wow were they not nearly as impressive.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  Halibut was very dry, almost jerky-like with very few gnocchi.  Lamb neck was decent, although presentation was a bit daunting.  I had the marrow, which was okay, but I've had a lot better (portion was way too large and some of it was cold), and the tartare was downright salty... I love salty foods but couldn't even finish it.  I really wanted to love this place, but I ended up just liking it.  Will I be back?  Yes, but I won't be nearly as excited next time.  I will say, though, the drinks are AMAZING.",

    "text": "Food that non-foodies would recognize in theory but elevated to a different class. I don't tend to love a busy plate, but every speck and smear had a purpose that made for a very pleasing build of flavors.  The tartare is not to be missed and the cocktails are well made. Our server, James, was sweet and has a keen interest in food. The only hiccup was with the meal progression as a salad and beer were slow to appear at our table...but proper meal progression seems to be elusive at many of restaurants we visit these days. The food was very well done, however, and even though we aren't die hard carnivores, butcher and the rye is a restaurant that it worth visiting!",

Disappointment 1- it is no longer on the menus. I had their pasta special, which consisted of leeks, roe, pig trotter, and general pasta goodness. I decided to try the new S'more. It arrived and disappointment 2- no element was warm. This was a deconstructed s'more. Homemade marshmallow, brown butter ice cream (a la fried ice cream), a chocolate ganache-type creation, and chocolate graham cracker. It looked ok. Then I tasted. OMG!  Dessert heaven. All disappointment washed away, carrot cake who?!  If you like s'mores, this will not disappoint. This was sweet, but the brown butter and graham elements tone it down. If I wouldn't have looked insane I would have ordered two. I will go back for this alone.",

    "text": "Although the name suggests that food is the focus (\"Butcher\" does come first in the name), clearly it's the \"Rye\" - and other whiskey spirits - that are the star of the show here. Not that comestibles are forgotten, FAR from that! I'd stick a fork in anyone who tried to come between me and my Shishito Peppers and aioli, Crispy Pig Wing, Roasted Brussels Sprouts or Pig Candy! It's just that when an entire floor-to-SOARING-ceiling wall-o-whiskey is the first thing you see when you come through the door, well...the emphasis is evident.  While you're perusing the premises, it will be hard to find one spot for your eye to settle on because there's so much to see. I swear the restaurant is as much an art installation as it is a spot for fine dining. And drinking, of course. The surroundings have been curated and built by the chef himself. Rick DeShantz, of Meat & Potatoes fame, put together a restaurant for all the senses. And I'm not just talking about the food.  Every elevation, twist and turn holds new curiosities from a Jackalope riding squirrel to a grown-ass bear to tattooed red leather chairs to door knobs for purse hooks on the upstairs bar made of recycled vintage doors to the quirky Ladies' Room downstairs that allows you to make eye contact and conversation with your across-the-divider neighbor and still take care of private necessities. I can only imagine what special features the Mens' Room has! Explore every level, explore every nook and cranny. What Chef DeShantz didn't handle himself, he hired the best of the best to tackle. Like the amazing murals!  Bottom line...if you're a fan of art, antiquities and bizarrities, check this place out. You won't be disappointed.   On to the cocktails. Please! Downstairs the wonderful wall-o-whiskey dominates the room. Here's where you'll settle in for flights and tastings and drinks made of the finest whiskeys around. At all price levels. You name the whiskey, I'd be shocked if B&R doesn't have it. Give it a try.   Head up the stairs...and up yet another smaller set of stairs still...and you find yourself at my own favorite spot of all. Bar Manager Mike Mills put his head together with Rick's to come up with a bar setup all other bartenders must drool over. There's even an area behind the bar to cook up syrups and shrubs, bitters and brews and all sorts of cocktail creativity. Be sure you order a classic cocktail here. My fave? A cool, refreshingly tart and sweet Ramos Gin Fizz. Oh my! There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever why the The Butcher and the Rye is a semi-finalist for James Beard Outstanding Bar Program this year!  Classic/craft cocktails not your scene? Maybe one of the original cocktails from some of the best bartenders in the city. (When I talked about Rick being a curator, I was talking about the way he gathered not just the artwork, but some of the most talented cocktologists in the city under one roof. Well...he and business partner Tolga Sevdik conspired to make that happen!)   One other thing...Monday nights from 6:00 PM on, there's a little (BIG) deal going on upstairs called PopUp Embury. Yep, The old renowned Embury makes a weekly appearance with the former Embury's own Spencer Warren behind the stick. Guest bartenders from all over the 'Burgh and elsewhere recreate the magic that was Embury for those of us who miss it or MISSED it before the magic ended. Don't miss it while it's there....last call for PopUp Embury is scheduled for March 31st. See you there!",

We had absinthe cocktails that were to die for.   We then returned for my birthday dinner last year and had incredible food, too. I was pregnant at the time & bummed I couldn't partake of any of the really cool cocktails they have, and they were so awesome that they made me some fancy, non-alcoholic \"cocktails\" on the fly -- the server just asked me what kind of flavors I liked, and the bartender came up with some kinda awesome thing with cloves stuffed into an orange slice that was easily one of the best drinks I've ever had, alcoholic or not.   The atmosphere is funky and very interesting, albeit a little claustrophobic with the tables very close together and so much going on all around you. I like that sort of thing (it reads more \"cozy\" to me), but if that's not your cup of tea, be warned.",

We ordered the bone marrow which was completely raw.  I'm an adventurous eater but this was extremely questionable. We've had bone marrow many times and it's always been a well cooked meat with nothing to worry about.  I served it to my girlfriend and a couple of my friends. I asked one of the waiters who wasn't our main waiter (who was incredibly kind and nice and understanding of the matter) and he said it's supposed to be buttery, but the fact of the matter is that it was raw. My girlfriend and I were the only two who were brave enough to try it because we thought there wasn't any issue, but it's about 30 min after the fact and we are both sick.   The drinks were bomb. The ambiance was amazing. The people were great. But the bone marrow was raw as can be. That's not okay.",

I felt bad going to a restaurant so close to their closing time, but we didn't really feel like fast food and we love Butcher's offerings.   Our server Sara(h,?) was great! She never made us feel like we were infringing on her getting ready to go home and was really engaging and able to take the time to talk to us about our favorite dishes and even about some different apple pie recipes which was so fun!   We had the pig candy which is always delicious and luckily my husband only wanted a little bit so I got a great big portion! I ordered the chicken as I always do and my husband ordered one of the daily specials which was a duck and foie gras tortellini. I wish I could have tried this dish(but can't right now due to the little one), but the small looking portion was very rich and heavy and according to my husband absolutely delicious. The chicken was absolute perfection as always and I am convinced the best chicken dish in all of Pittsburgh.   Sara was nice enough to let us know when there was about 10 minutes left before the kitchen was closing and tempted us with dessert. We ended up with the salted caramel apple pie and cream cheese ice cream which absolutely blew everything else that we ate out of the water! I can't explain to you how good this dish was other than to say that as someone who constantly is working to perfect her own apple pie recipe that I am not sure mine could ever come close to the perfection that was this pie. It was absolutely delicious.   As always, I will be back!",

This dish was so delectable, I'd consider an all-cauliflower diet forever, if this version was on standby.  Mac N Cheese: A lovely little cast iron pot of tender mac n cheese. Who doesn't love THAT?! Could've used a little kick of some kind, but I enjoyed it just the same.  Pig Candy:  I couldn't remember this dish too well given that I was caught up in my Santa Cider from Arsenal at the time, but as Jonathan D. reminded me, it was \"Big ******* piece of pork belly.\"  A little crispy around the edges and all-around delicious.  Country Ham:  This isn't Honeybaked. This is fresh from the Charcuterie kinda stuff.  A little salty; but that's the ham's fault.  Still, a worthwhile dish I might consider again.  Dirty Pasta:  Pasta.  Meat.  Sauce.  Sausage?  Don't know, don't care. Delicious.  And I don't even like pasta. Yeah, that's right.   Mussels:  I ordered the Mussels & Brussels; two separate dishes, one hilarious joke.  The Mussels were reminiscent of the mussels at Meat & Potatoes - not surprising given their owners.  Just like M & P, these mussels did not disappoint.  Bathed in a creamy curry, they are \"slimy yet satisfying\" (quick, name that Disney movie).   Brussel Sprouts:  I'm one of those people that eats strange things in the car.  Some people eat McDonald's, I eat olives or entire cans of Reddi Whip.  If I could somehow manage it, these grilled brussel sprouts would be top of that list.  These bad boys of baby cabbages are so wonderful, even the most passionate brussels naysayers will fall in love with them.  Rice Cake:  The best.thing.EVER.  I don't know WHAT this is or HOW it's made, but I would eat these amaze-balls balls any day of the week.  They defy description, so I kindly ask you to take my word for it.  The moral of this visit was, I don't know how these dishes are prepared, nor do I know the majority of what they contain.  Regardless, each of them was a culinary masterpiece fit for any Pittsburgh palate, if you dare.",

FOOD - I had mussels, marrow, pig candy, duck liver pate, and wagyu flank steak. The portions were good, price were good, and everything tasted good. Though we ordered our steak medium rare, it seemed a little overcooked and asked them to make it again for us, which was again a little overcooked. Overall, other than the duck liver pate, everything was mediocre.  SERVICE - service was excellent!  ENVIRONMENT -  I liked the vibe of the place, and it would be a great place to grab a drink and eat appetizers. It won't be a good place to bring kids or for a large group of people.  I gave three stars to the place because although there was nothing that bothered me, they weren't excellent. I probably will not come back here and rather go to Meat and Potatoes.",

    "text": "After having this restaurant on my to-visit list for a long time, my girlfriend and I finally went here to eat several Saturdays ago for dinner.  On first impression, the restaurant has an extremely interesting interior, from the bar that spans 2 stories, to the bookshelves behind my girlfriend filled with old encyclopedias, a skeleton stored in a glass container and a taxidermy bear.  Unfortunately neither of us got mixed drinks from that massive display of liquor because we were both dehydrated from a day on the point, but both of the tables next to us were remarking about how much they were enjoying theirs.  To start, we got the pig candy.  I've never had a piece of pork prepared like this before and it was quite interesting to eat such a tasty piece of pork that melted in your mouth like this.  For entrees, I got the seared halibut with gnocchi and my girlfriend got seared scallops.  The halibut in my dish was definitely the best halibut I've ever had and the dish overall was quite interesting given the eclectic mix of vegetables, sauces, and even raisins present.  Every bite was like a new adventure into the unknown.  My girlfriend's scallops were prepared excellently as well, and we both thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  The service was prompt and friendly as well.  The price was on the steep side especially considering we didn't get the rather expensive mixed drinks, but we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "I wish I could join the chorus. I really like Meat and Potatoes their other restaurant. Everything was a near miss. It's a cool menu, they have a great bar, the decor is great. Service was ok. Perhaps trying to do too much?  They're opening 2 other restaurants from what I gather. It's a familiar tale.   I tried 3 dishes. The first was a special. Squash soup garnished with duck confit and pickled cranberries as I recall. This was the best of the 3. A bit more duck please as there were just a few shards of overcooked bits. It came out just barely warm.  Maybe they spent too much time garnishing it?  Would have been nicer, hotter.    Next, \"Brussels\". A bowl of Brussel sprouts in brown butter with a lemon aioli and dill topped with grated cheese. Still a bit nauseous thinking about it. Where was the dill?  The aioli was smeared inside the bowl a bit.  There was barely enough to talk about. They didn't skimp on the butter though. Ugh. It was swimming.    Somewhere around this time my eyes started burning and I thought I would be treated for smoke inhalation from the burning bread in the kitchen.  I imagine the near loaf they serve as under their Cesar salad being torched helplessly under the salamander until no trace of the craftsmanship of the baker remained. Sure enough, my dining companions Cesar bread was burnt.   Lastly, I had the pig wings. Long beans, mango (too little) other veggies, cilantro, glazed and somewhat candied pork. Interesting dish but lacked balance. It was way too sweet just as my wife's peppers were way too salty. Everything missed.",

    "text": "We initially came here just for drinks but after watching several dishes go by and as the whiskey flowed, I just had to eat something.  In retrospect, I should have eaten more because the food and cocktails were delicious.  My wife and I sat at the very impressive bar which has dozens of whiskeys amongst an impressive host of other spirits.  You can tell from the jump that this is a cocktail bar.  Our bartender, Giuseppe was both a very able mixologist and a real treasure to chat with.  He expertly crafted drinks for the two of us while being a very good spokesperson for the city of Pittsburgh.  I'm sad that we only visited The Butcher and the Rye once and on the final evening of our trip.  I went off menu almost immediately just because I assumed (correctly thankfully) that this would be the kind of place that I could get an aged rum old fashioned.  Our barman smiled and ran upstairs to find one of their hidden bottles and made the drink perfectly.  My wife really enjoyed her moscow mule and while we stayed for a few more beverages, these two really stood out.  As for food, I got to have an order of the pig candy and the flavor of the dish changed as I ate it.  At first, I wasn't wowed because the sweet caramel seemed a bit much paired with the apple kimchi.  A bite or two later, the flavors really came together and then I found myself craving more.  Perhaps my mouth just had to be calibrated to appreciate this particular dish but I thought it was really well crafted and I'm happy I ordered it.  When (if) I'm in Pittsburgh next, this place will be a must visit.",

    "text": "My one and only dining experience in Pittsburgh was AMAZING! The decor of this place is simply astounding. My friend and I took turns pointing out eccentric decor pieces to each other & there are so many!   The servers were so incredibly nice and in that genuine, non-snooty way. It was so refreshing compared to what I have to deal with in NYC.  Now, for the food. The brussel sprouts were great. Top notch. Loved them and I don't like brussel sprouts (at least not before). It comes in a huge bowl with a huge mountain of shredded cheese.   The marrow was very buttery and smooth and fatty which I think makes it good marrow. I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into ordering that marrow but I thought it would be fun. Beware if you don't want a tablespoon full of pure fat. It was adorned with parsley and capers which I slid right off. I didn't care too much for the combination of flavors. Oxtail jam served atop two pieces of bread also accompanied the marrow which both my friend and I thought was the winner of the dish. You should eat that first because if not the juice from the oxtail jam will make the bread soggy.  The pork belly dish was divine but that's probably because it was very Vietnamese-like and I love Vietnamese food. Some of the pork belly meat was a bit chewy though. It came with pickled carrots and daikon (?) which you would normally see in a banh mi. And I'm pretty sure I tasted a hint of fish sauce on the pork belly.  The burger comes with fries (which were not that great). While we ordered it medium rare (as recommended), it came out medium well. Odd, but okay. The buns were unfortunately not toasted (sad face).   I would recommend the brussel sprouts & pork belly but try dishes other than the marrow and burger to complete your meal!",

I loved the whiskey wall; it was a thing of beauty, but the cocktails failed to wow me.   But the food, my goodness, the food. The gf and I ordered the focaccia, brussels, pig candy, wagyu flank steak (cooked rare), and dirty pasta. Focaccia was fresh and tasty, but nothing special. Pig Candy was better, but as a guy who eats a lot of pork belly, didn't  exceed my expectations. Brussels were delicious: I highly recommend. Dirty Pasta was rich and packed full of flavor. I originally wanted the Butcher Burger, but unfortunately did not arrive in time (7:45) to grab one of the 20 made each day. The Wagyu did not disappoint; I hesitated at first because I'm a snob about things labeled \"Wagyu\" (as far as I'm concerned, the only Wagyu I've ever truly had was in Japan), but I'm glad I ordered it because it was superb. All the flavors on the plate just meshed together beautifully.   Bottom line: Food was amazing, they know what they're doing here.",

The hostess, who was very nice, mentioned  there was a private party upstairs but that I could get a drink and wait for a spot at the bar downstairs. I had a glass of wine and waited for a seat.  After a few minutes, a seat opened up. I sat down next to a very nice/talkative older couple.  I asked a female bartender if I could see a menu.  She angrily replied, \"..what? I don't have time to take care of you. As you can see I am extremely busy. You'll have to ask someone else.\" Her comment made me very uncomfortable -- especially because I had to sit directly facing her during my entire meal. The decor and ambience were great despite the awful bartender with the attitude.  I ordered the Brussels and dirty pasta. The food had great taste but was very very oily, especially the Brussels.  I recommend the pasta -- it was cooked perfectly. The sauce was ground duck, carrot and pecorino romano. Ultimately, I was disappointed by the service.  But, loved the ambiance and inside decor.  .",

I'm more partial to stovetop (creamy) mac and cheese than I am to the eggy kind that's baked in an oven, and this totally hit the spot! Rich and garlicky, I wanted to lick the bowl when it was gone. I also tried the lamb gravy, which was like the richest bolognese I've ever had. Really excellent.  The decor is like a shabby chic hunting season goth nightmare--including the best use of velvet wallpaper I've seen in a while. Cool and dark on a hot summer day, and the light fixtures made from antlers lend a True Detective air to the dining room. You sit on mismatched wooden chairs and, if you're upstairs, eat guarded by a massive taxidermied grizzly bear. The \"wall of whiskey\" is rather impressive, though I'm not partial to whiskey myself. I did have a very nice rye cocktail, the Rye Buck, which I can only liken to a thinking woman's whiskey sour. The Hazel-Rah, a take on a mai tai made with hazelnut bitters, is also delicious.  We were lucky enough to be able to score a reservation here pretty easily, but it DOES fill up quite quickly, so the sooner you call for a place the better. There are some communal tables in the front that are first-come-first-serve, but every time I've walked past here right after opening, they're filled up, so I think those may be difficult to get as well. So call them up and get ready for the best mac and cheese everrrrr. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "(11/11/2014)  This one has got to go on your list, Butcher and the Rye was the star of our 2-day, 8-stop, self-guided restaurant crawl of dahntahn Pittsburgh.  Its sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes gets all the press play, but the older and more sophisticated Butcher and the Rye is better experience of the two.  Both plates we tried had thoughtful, balanced flavors and contrast of textures.  The Dry Aged Tartare had some wonderful garnishes to accentuate the marbled beef (diced a touch large, chewy at times).  I appreciated the crunchy texture of radishes and mache, and brightness of parsley oil, and tart pickled mustard seed as foils to the richness of the slow cooked egg and black garlic aioli.  PEI mussels were cooked until just done, plump and bursting, came with a totally addictive red curry (had some heat), coconut milk, tomato, lime and cilantro liqueur.  The rest of the menu straddles upscale comfort food and creative palate adventures.  Service, at the bar at least, was spot on and friendly.  Cocktails were very good (but can't remember what I had, something with Buffalo Trace).  Decor is like being in an ersatz old timey Western movie hotel, check out the pistol and butcher's knives on the taps and wall of bourbon (bourbon lover's paradise) and blanched antler chandelier. I so loved everything about this place up until I had to go to the bathroom.  A grown up place needs some real bathrooms, I will leave it at that.  If you try this place (and you must), you'll know what I mean.",

Last time we stopped, we grabbed a seat at the bar for dinner.  I had the mussels and they were good (not point brugge good though), and my husband got the burger--which he deemed one of the best he'd ever eaten.  Obviously the big draw here is the bar - and the cocktails in particular.  Sometimes I just get the punch, but I will usually order a bourbon drink and they're definitely some of the best ever.  They also have a small selection of great beers on tap if that's your thing. It's usually mine but I can't see past the wall o' bourbon!

My parents raved about the burger, so we split that for 18$ along with some of the more creative sounding sides, such as octopus, bread with pan drippings, and others that I have forgotten.  The burger was only ok.  I feel like 18$ is setting a pretty high bar.  I would definitely order something different next time.  The service was great - super efficient.  Everything was definitely good.  The restaurant is super trendy - I loved the art on the tables.  I don't know if I would come back as I am definitely in the Meat and Potatoes camp.",

Had the brussel sprouts as a starter and they were great. For entrees, I had the halibut, and my bestie had the rabbit. Both arrived hot and both were delicious. We both had the chocolate mousse cup for dessert. It wasn't too sweet and it was the perfect portion size.   I'd definitely go back. An overall great dining experience.",

    "text": "While we were in the Pittsburgh suburbs visiting family over the holidays my husband planned a date night in the city. His choice for the evening was Butcher and the Rye. He made reservations for a Saturday night and off we went. We parked in a nearby parking garage and made our way over to the restaurant. We were quickly greeted by the hostess and a quote on the wall from a customer that basically read \"the scallops are better than sex and I've had a lot of sex\". Wow! I thought to myself... I guess I better get the scallops!  We were lead to our table on the second floor in a cozy corner lined with a bookshelf full of encyclopedias. I really loved the decor but we were squeezed in between two other 2 tops and I honestly felt like we were dining with company. I could hear the conversations from both tables very clearly which led to an interesting date night for me and my husband.   We ordered a few appetizers to start... the shishito peppers, the scallops (full portion), and the dirty pasta (half portion). Our server said the full portion of pasta was large and most people don't finish it. For dinner we ordered the Venison Osso Buco.   It took a while for our food to come out. The table to our left sat after us and got their appetizers before us (the seemed to know the manager because he kept bringing them out complimentary items). Finally when our food came out and was placed on the table, I looked at my husband and he said, \"We are going to have to go McDonalds on the way home.\" I said,\"We are going to starve here!\" The portions were tiny, especially the pasta!! It was the smallest half portion of pasta I have ever seen, but it was sooooooo good! The rest of the meal I kept telling my husband that we should have ordered the full portion. I am still thinking about that pasta till this day!  Going back to our friends dining with us that we've never met... they both ordered the half portion of the scallops appetizer and were complaining that they only got one scallop. I think the half portion was $12 or $13.   In the end, I enjoyed our night out. The food was tasty but I felt the portions could have been larger. In regards to the scallops being better than sex... that lady is having sex with the wrong people.",

    "text": "One of my favorite bars Pitt. I actually left my jacket here once and they mailed it home to me in Maryland. That was so cool!!! These bartenders are the real deal. They really know their stuff and I'm particular whiskey!!! The food menu is small but exceptional. This time I tried the dry aged tartar despite being very tempted by the buttermilk fried rabbit. For my cocktail I went with smoky mountain high. Sort of a hybrid ol fashioned and it was killer. The apple bitters, smoked maple syrup and dried apple on top was perfectly blended to make a very interesting variation on a classic. The tartar was one of the best things I ever put in my mouth. The cured egg roll melded perfectly with the dry aged filet mignon while the black garlic aoli rounded everything out and the crispness of the occasional radish kept it refreshing to the palate. Bartenders are what they should be. Friendly, interactive and totally on point with their beverages. Love this place! get to know Shipwreck the bartender 10/5",

Timing with the cheese board and entrees was a bit off but it took a second to find out if we were able to actually order some extra honeycomb for the cheese. One entree ordered was the rabbit. Literal perfection. I had the scallops which were cooked to perfect as well but only on one side. The only real complaint I have is that my risotto was over cooked and a little mushy I still ate half. Our server was really really sweet. I wish I could remember his name.

My family and I made reservations for 5pm, right as the restaurant opened for dinner. Good thing, too - the line of fellow diners waiting for dinner to start literally stretched out the door and down part of the sidewalk. The restaurant was full within minutes of officially opening for evening service. So yeah: reservations are definitely recommended here!   Despite the place being full of people immediately from the start of service, we never felt neglected during our visit. The dining staff were prompt and efficient, as were the extra busy bartenders. I especially want to thank the staff for patiently explaining parts of the menu to my excited carnivore father. He was having trouble selecting an order and had a lot of questions, all of which were answered thoroughly.  He ended up ordering one of their specials at the time, while I opted for scallops atop a blue crab risotto; my brother the roasted chicken; and my mother the brussels appetizer. Everything was fantastic! The cuts of meat were tender; the main and side dishes alike were well and uniquely seasoned; and the meal as whole was expertly crafted and very deserving of the prices being charged for each plate. In addition to enjoying the samples from my family's plates, my risotto - despite being a bit rich - was such a tasty delight that I just HAD to eat every bite of it!  We all left full and satisfied, and all agreed that we would happily come back for a future special occasion. Thank you for the amazing birthday noms, guys!",

The app on the iPad was impressive as it gave you multiple avenues to search for the perfect whiskey. They had more than anybody can fathom. Prices were high compared so what I've seen elsewhere but that is mildly expected.   Food was very tasty but the portions are small. I got the scallops and it's about half a cup of risotto and 3 scallops for 33 bucks. The scallops were large though.

The rabbit was cooked perfectly--not too dry, and the flavors were amazing.

Everything we ate that night, from the fried rabbit entree, to the pasta, to the Sunday gravy, was perfectly seasoned and delicious. It's the kind of restaurant where we were talking about the food the next morning. The cocktails were also out of this world and really lovely--all the ingredients were perfectly balanced and wonderful. The bartender who made our cocktails was friendly and really helpful and our server was knowledgeable and pleasant as well. This is a great place to bring a date as it's dark and cozy and would surely impress.   The only negative was that one of the hosts was a little off-putting upon arrival. We had a reservation and he seemed like he thought he was doing us a favor by letting us in the door--our table wasn't ready at our reservation time and he told us to go to the bar area and have a cocktail. We ordered a cocktail, which just arrived upon him coming to get us and he seemed annoyed that we hadn't closed out. I think that at most restaurants of this caliber, they would just seat you and either move the check to your table or bring it there? It seemed like an odd system and wasn't a great way to start the dinner, but otherwise everything was delicious and the rest of the staff wonderful. Maybe the host was just having a bad evening.",

If you have to wait, don't worry, there are two bars (upstairs and downstairs) that have amazing cocktails, wines, beers, and whisk(e)y/bourbon. I was traveling for work and was alone so I was able to easily grab a seat at the bar which is full service - always a plus!   I took the bartenders recommendation and ordered the Dirty Pasta. It's one of their signature items (duck, herbs, garlic, shallot, and strozzapretti pasta) and it did not disappoint. The pasta quality was top-notch. I heard they bring it in from Brooklyn. Not only was it delicious, but it was perfectly cooked and still had a bit of chew to it. It's not overly sauced and it's a good balance of rich but not too overwhelming. The serving size isn't huge but it seems to be just right.   It was so good that I came back the next night to do it all again!   Both times I had either a starter or side, they were awesome and had some complexity - good balances of heat, acid, fat.   To top it all off, the staff is friendly and not unapproachable like you can sometimes get at places that specialize in fancy booze and cocktails.   I would call Butcher and the Rye a must try and do yourself a favor and order the Dirty Pasta, even if it's just to share for the table.",

I also tried the punch of the day - I don't remember what was in it, but it was really good. It had spices like cinnamon and just the right sweetness. I've been here before, also for cocktails only, and everything we tried was good.  As for food, I haven't had a chance to sit down for a proper meal. I did try the gnocchi which was a daily special. It wasn't too memorable, so I'd like to come back and try the regular menu, hence the four stars for now. Service at the bar counter was good - waters were kept full and the bartender checked in on how the drinks were.",

    "text": "The attention to detail here is insane...absolutely insane. Everything from the decor, to the food, to the cocktails, and dessert is a work of art. Every taste or sip is meticulously crafted to ensure your optimum enjoyment. In a town that is starting to get big into the food scene, Butcher and the Rye really has put itself above the rest.  We started with two cocktails: the Irishman and the punch. The beautiful wall of whiskeys was gorgeous, but since walking in and seeing the most Hipster guy in the world rigorously shaking cocktails, we opted for something with more flair than a plain shot. Both were fabulous and contained whiskey, but were easy to drink for light drinkers. Every detail was just so, from a latte-like appearance on the Irishman to a perfect pink hue to the punch.  The food was also out of the world. My date and I shared the pig candy, lemon cake, and ordered two Waygu flank steaks. The pig candy I honestly can hardly describe; it was a euphoric mix of salty, vinegary, sweet, and (of course) bacony. The steak was delicious, tender, cooked exactly to my liking, and lasted probably a whole ten minutes on our table. The dessert was literally like a painting with the meringue splattered across the plate like paint. It tasted even better than it looked and was really unique.  The service is great, as well. Our server was patient with providing us recommendations and answering all of our questions. The food and drinks were timely, and we left incredibly full and happy. We are from Cleveland, but would driving all the way here for any birthdays or special occasions; I really can't get the pig candy out of my mind.",

I visited during a work trip and as a lone diner, enjoyed my meal very much! I ordered the bone marrow (yes for 1!) and the pig candy, which both I was excited about just by reading about it or viewing it on the menu.  The bone marrow was perfectly cooked and just what I imagined and craved - the toast that it came with was delicious and not too crunchy (sometimes it is). The pig candy was flavorful with the miso sauce, fatty but not overwhelming, and the meat was tender.  Drinks - standard, which I could appreciate. The staff, though only a short engagement, was friendly enough.  Overall, great quick dining experience but food is really top notch.",

I had the same dish in Italy a few weeks ago and the dirty pasta was just as good!! My husband had the lamb neck. He thought it was a little too smokey.

    "text": "Color me impressed! We had been underwhelmed by M&P (mostly with the service), so I had been hesitant to try Butcher and the Rye. However, we were going to Heinz Hall across the street for the Symphony, so we wandered in at 6pm on a Friday night with no reservation. The hostess offered to seat us outside or at the bar, and when I mentioned that the bar looked full, she let me know that there was an upstairs bar that had many seats available. This upstairs bar was great--Kimber, the bartender, was gregarious yet efficient, and the upstairs area was considerably quieter, perfect for our date night.  We ordered the pig candy (small plate), the rabbit rillette, and the dirty pasta (large plate). My husband was so enamored with the rillette that he was about to order another one, when the gentleman behind the bar cautioned us that our upcoming pasta dish was quite rich, and we might want to hold off. The pig candy was really tasty, and the kimchi cut through the richness nicely. However, the star of the show was definitely the dirty pasta. The strozzapretti was beautifully chewy, and the cream sauce was rich, but not overpowering. It was something akin to a white bolognese, with meaty chunks of duck, fine pieces of carrot, and just enough liquid to bring the cheese and everything else together.  We also enjoyed several drinks, the most standout of which was the Trade Winds, a five-spiced version of a Moscow Mule. Drinks here are not cheap, but they are innovative and made with care.  We'll be back.",

While I can't lie and say that the offerings are affordable for a weekly visit, it wasn't as bad as I had expected. Maybe it had something to do with my dining alone on this particular experience.  I started myself out with the Spalla, which combined an amazing flavor of orange and almond with the shoulder. It was an amazing experience for my palate that only cost me ten dollars. That was money well spent. For my main course, I decided on the \"Dirty Pasta\", which is actually an amazing duck mixed with strozzapreti. It had a good bit of romano cheese shredded on top. It was delightful. To finish my meal, I decided to have the artisanal cheese board. I'm a lover of good cheeses and the selection was excellent. Some new ones that I had not experienced before that made everything well worth the price. Overall, I spent less than $50 for an amazing meal coupled with a delightful atmosphere. While this isn't (and could not be) a weekly treat for me, I will make it a point to return sometime soon.",

For our meals - based on Yelp - we chose scallops and the Dirty Pasta. Great portions, awesome flavor combinations and appealing plating.   Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake  which was scrumptious.   Our server was Ralph: efficient and made excellent recommendations.    Living 35 minutes from New York we have had great meals. However, Butcher and the Rye gives your the food, the vibe and great service.   We recommend using the valet: it is convenient and cheap compared to NY pricing ($12).

We were immediately sat at a communal table right next to the front door on the first floor with two other women in the opposite end of the table. The seating is a long hard wooden bench and the table is extremely wide. Not only would the other patrons not move a single inch to allow us to sit down but the noise level was such that we could not hear one another across the table. We asked if it was possible to move to another table further from the bar or upstairs but we're advised nothing was available they had \"a lot of 2 top\" reservations that night. We decided to leave a we did not want o yell to one another then entire meal nor share our table with other people. Although we also have an unused gift card for this establishment it is highly unlikely we would give it another chance. Definitely NOT a date night restaurant if you have any interest in actually hearing what you date has to say or having your own table and space.",

From the dimly lit chandelier and old fashioned wallpaper to the scrolls rolled down to feature the specials, to the knives and cleavers hanging near the entrance, to the cleaver draft handles, down to the ladder behind the bar to access numerous bourbons and scotches ... the speakeasy-lodge atmosphere just works. Rustic, hip, trendy yet timeless all in one. We sat at the bar on a Saturday night, and Allison was a terrific bartender. She was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and made our first experience here great! Every cocktail we tried was fresh, balanced, and creative yet classic. She offered us a list of the available bourbons also, which was nice to browse through.  The food we tried was delicious. We decided to try some new things we've never had before, the main one being bone marrow! (Alison helped convince us to try it!) We both enjoyed it- buttery texture with the sea salt, on top of oxtail jam- very interesting yet yummy. I would get it again and look forward to trying bone marrow at other places now that I know I like it. We also got the pig candy. You must try this here! Sweet, salty, and lick-the-plate delicious. We also got the dry aged tartare plate - and were very pleased ... So many flavors combined together.  Next time we are in Pittsburgh we will make sure to go back and make reservations- or hope to get lucky and sit at the bar and have Allison as our bartender again!",

    "text": "Finally went to Butcher and the Rye last night.  We got a super early reservation which was about as good as we could do for literally weeks.  The place, however, was less than 1/2 full (except for the two bars) the entire time we were there (5:20-7:15).  Which made me wonder why it's so hard to get a res?  Oh, well.  Just note this suggests you can pop in after all.  The decor is interesting.  NYC-hipster-trendy-meets-hunting-lodge?  I thought it was interesting.  My husband was like, huh?  The service was prompt and very pleasant.  A definite A plus.    Of course the drinks and menu bore comparison to M&P, which we love.  This menu seemed bigger and a bit funkier/less \"accessible\" than M&P.  Lots of aps/small pates, which is a big plus to me.  Not too much on the menu for pickier eaters.  (Actually, my husband had a limited selection, but I blame him for being picky... doesn't care for tomatoes, pasta and several varieties of cheese... rather limiting.)    We both started with manhattans, which were easily on par with the ones at the speakeasy at the william penn.  Definitely worth the trip alone.  I ordered three apps, because I like to taste things (and don't mind left overs).  I had the special greens & beans, brussels and shisihto.  The greens & beans were an interesting take and were tasty enough, but nothing overwhelming.  The brussels and shishito were delish.  I would definitely order them again.  Roasted brussels sprouts with dill and lemon aoli and shishito (japanese peppers) with siracha aioli -- yum!    My husband ordered the hanger steak feature, which he declared one of the best food compositions, if not the best, he's ever eaten.  He just wished there was more of it.  (Not a huge portion size and he's a big guy.... he should have ordered a salad...)  I also had a sazerac.  Expertly crafted.    Total bill came to $104, which I thought was pretty reasonably for the quality of the food.  Cocktails are $10, which is downright cheap for this sort of place downtown.  All in all, we'd definitely go back.  Next time, I'd probably just do apps at the bar with cocktails.",

    "text": "We were in Pittsburgh for a weekend and of course we could not get a reservation on short notice.  Luckily the two of us were able to get seats at the bar on a very busy Saturday evening.  A friend had recommended BatR and after reading other reviews we wanted to give it a try  The atmosphere is as described in the other reviews.  A young, loud and energetic crowd is apparently here every night.  The impressive wall of over 350 bottles of whisky is almost a little intimidating when deciding on a drink.  Before taking our drink orders the bartenders brought glasses of water.  A nice extra for a bar specializing in traditional cocktails.  I started with their oak barrel aged Manhattan, recommended by the bartender.  He stated it is one of their most popular cocktails.  The drink was a great start to the evening.  I can understand its popularity.  From now on, I will judge all other Manhattans against this one.  Two of us ordered two small plates and one large plate. The food was enough for me (a larger appetite) and her (a smaller appetite).  Everybody was talking about the fried Brussels sprouts so we tried them.  They were wonderful, fried to a medium brown with shaved cheese and just enough seasoning to make them savory.  The only downside to the dish was a tad too much oil (grease) in the bottom of the bowl.  The Pig Candy must have taken hours to prepare.  Pork belly was slow cooked, tender and flavorful with a semi-sweet glaze, served over spicy apples prepared with a Korean inspired kimchi sauce.  The semi-sweet pork and spicy apple was a surprising combination.  I actually enjoyed the spicy apple more than the pork belly.  Definitely not your traditional pork chops and apple sauce.  She wanted the monkfish served over blue crab risotto.  Chanterelle mushrooms, capers and fried kale chips rounded out this dish.  Each bite had a different flavor combination as we mixed and matched the different elements on the plate.  She thought the risotto could have had more crab flavor but I had no complaints.  I thought the risotto was creamy and balanced.  My second cocktail of the evening was the Sazerac.  When the bartender brought it over I was unimpressed.  Served neat in a highball glass, it looked like I was short-poured.  But then I tasted it.  Wow!  The flavors exploded.    Her cocktail was a creation of the bartender not on the menu.  A citrus blend with Prosecco garnished with a lemon twist.  She thought it was just OK.  I tried a sip and thought it was quite good - like a lemon-lime soda for adults.  Even though the joint was packed, the trio of bartenders managed to keep up with the crowd.  They were very helpful and made excellent recommendations without over-selling.  Some of the earlier reviews gave negative marks for service, but we had no complaints.    If you go, get a reservation or hope to get lucky for open bar seats.  BatR does not open until 5 most nights so get there early if you do not have a reservation.  For the price, I was expecting a lot and I was not disappointed.",

    "text": "I think I would put this more at ALMOST 4 stars if I could.   We got there and the hostess was nice. We were seated upstairs at a good table and you cant deny the decorating is something to talk about (although get rid of the horrible painting at the bar). It did feel crowded, not because of the people but of how much stuff they have in there, but I get it.   Service: Our waitress was nice enough. Wasnt really able to tell us too much about the meals in detail but at least answered honestly when we asked if the coffee was good (not really), and she was right! Biggest thank you to her was not bothering us that I wanted only one glass of wine and he didnt want any. We traveled, we didnt want to drink and I know places that would have kept pushing it and acting annoyed. She didnt.  Food: Really good. I had the scallops which were good - slightly over done but cant complain. He has the Pot Pie - excellent presentation!  Bathrooms: Come on. Nothing trendy or fun about those. Saloon doors don't work when you're tall and trying to squat yet being able to see over the doors and therefore staring in the mirror while someone is washing their hands. Major fail.  Overall: Good food, would go back if I was in Pittsburgh. The roped off third floor was really weird. You don't find that in major cities so seeing that in Pittsburgh was a bit odd. Not sure what they are trying to show. \"Trying to hard\" was what I kept thinking when I saw that. Almost makes the place seem dated to be honest. Would go to eat and drink though.",

    "text": "I had a fantastic time here with friends last week. My friend made a reservation for us about a month in advance, so when the time came to finally go, it felt like Christmas morning. Almost.  I absolutely adore the decor-rustic luxe meets shabby chic. There are hundreds of bourbons and whiskeys on the wall of the downstairs bar, and it's a really beautiful focal point. We were seated downstairs, and had a great view of the fun fabric wallpapers and cute cottage-style mirrors on the walls.   There were four of us, and we wanted to sample a variety of items, so we ordered most of the small plates on the menu and shared them. My favorites were the brussels, the shishitos, the mac and cheese, and the fresh foccacia with whipped ricotta. The brussels sprouts were crispy and perfectly tender. Shishito peppers are one of my favorite things in the entire universe (not even joking), so I was in heaven when I saw them on the menu. A spicy cream sauce accompanied them on the side and the creamy decadence of it balanced out the shishitos nicely. The mac and cheese was gooey and heavy and oh so creamy. I'm glad I only had a few bites. It was fantastic, but all that heaviness would have done me in had I devoured the whole thing myself. They always have a fresh bread special, and it was nice to have some bread for the table to balance out the other dishes. I generally try to avoid bread, but this foccacia was to die for. It was puffy and fluffy and went perfectly with the whipped ricotta that I slathered all over it.   We also ordered the caulfilower with farro, the crispy pig skin, and the pig candy. These dishes were fantastic as well, although I preferred the lighter, vegetable-based dishes. For dessert, we couldn't decide between the options, so we ordered three! We ordered the pot de creme, sticky buns, and the deep fried brownie. The dark chocolate pot de creme was my favorite, and I would order it again in a heartbeat. It was creamy and rich, but not overly so. The sticky buns were super sweet, but the nuts covering them added a hint of salt that balanced out the dish somewhat. Definitely on the sweet side for me, but a fun dish to try! I couldn't force myself to try the deep fried brownie because I was stuffed to the gills by this point, but my friend gobbled it up and said it was one of the best desserts she'd ever eaten. That's saying something!   Drinks were delicious as well. I had a non-alcoholic ginger concoction, and it was spicy and sweet at the same time. The wine list is fairly extensive, and my husband was able to find several reds that he enjoyed. My beer connoiseur friend was content with his beer selections, and my cocktail-loving friend enjoyed the house punch of the day very much!  Highly recommend!",

I recommend you definitely make reservations.  We were seated downstairs and I love the decor of the place-rustic with animal heads on the walls yet trendy. The bar is super cool and it was packed!  They have a nice drink menu and the prices are reasonable. I started off with the  Arsenal Santa Cinnamon-this is delicious but you get 7 oz for $8.  My next drink was the Penn Weizen which was only $4.  Our server was really knowledgably about the specials and menu items. We were served quickly and he checked in on us numerous times. I went with the cauliflower which was delicious and had a sweet/savory taste with carrots and a nice sauce.  I also got the country ham which was ok. I would not get this again. You get 2 small biscuits that don't have much taste with a few pieces of cured ham. The yogurt dipping sauce was good.  Others in my party ordered the mussels. I'm not a fan of seafood but you got a huge portion.  The rice cakes and Brussels sprout dishes were amazing and glad I got to sample them.  The mac and cheese looked delicious as well as the dirty pasty which was very tasty!  Wish we saved room for dessert.  The small plates are enough to eat on your own-probably recommend 2 per person or fun to share!",

I was excited to go to the Butcher and the Rye because I walk past it everyday when I go to work, but have never gone.. Until now. We had a great waiter and he suggested drinks for us based on the kinds of flavors we liked. I went with the Lions Tail. I believe it had bourban, lime, and a couple other ingredients all served over ice. It was so good... And so smooth. The perfect drink to warm you up when it's 5 degrees outside (as it was yesterday!) As far as food, I got the Caesar salad and Shishito. My salad was so good! A plate of baby kale with tomatoes, cheese and a Caesar dressing. Underneath the salad was a piece of bread just soaking up all of the flavors. It was delicious!!  Now onto my other small plate, Shishito. I have to be honest and tell you that I had to google what Shishito was before I ordered it. I read that they are small, sweet peppers so I decided to go with it. Oh my goodness were they delicious! They were grilled and seasoned with miso salt. They had came with radish slices, cilantro, and lime wedges. Around the end of the plate was a spicy sauce that sort of tasted like spicy mayo. I can't get over how good they were! My best friend got the Brussels small plate. I don't even like Brussel Sprouts but I tried them and oh my gosh!! Amazing! They came with a garlic aioli and it was so good too! I ended my meal with the smores dessert. Friend ice cream, bourbon marshmallows, chocolate graham crackers and dark chocolate bars. Need I say more? Delicious! Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. I can't wait to go back try other items on the menu!",

The small dishes are very filling and everything we ate tasted unbelievable. We had the deep fried brussels sprouts, the sunday gravy (melts in your mouth), and the pig candy. They were not particularly helpful with answering questions on gluten, so I had to be careful. We went at 6:30 on a weeknight, the place was very crowded and somewhat loud. We were seated on the top floor, which was pretty dark (hard to read the menu). However, we found it to be perfect for a romantic date with the intimacy of the small table and dim lighting. I wouldn't recommend it as a hangout unless you sit on the ground floor or at a bar. We would definitely go back!",

    "text": "Butcher and the Rye is the second restaurant from the guys behind Meat & Potatoes. And it is just as beautiful as its sister location inside. The man behind the design is none other then the chef himself, Rick DeShantz. Rick and team paid close attention to every detail in the space and clearly understood that part of the battle of a great dining experience comes from the atmosphere.  I only explored the downstairs area as it was pretty jam-packed full of people. But the downstairs is sexy. It feels straight out of a Kinfolk magazine spread. Butcher paper on rollers with hand written specials hang from the wall. A wall full of spirits glow from backlighting. And a chandelier made from what looks to be barrel hoops is anchored to the far side of the bar. I'd live there. In a heartbeat.  And the menu isn't too bad either. I need to go back for dinner but the Onion + Brioche Soup and Mac-N-Cheese we sampled were both super tasty. I just wish there would have been more.  If you want to sit at the bar or communal tables, I'd suggest getting there as close to 5 p.m. as possible. If not, make yourself a reservation and soak up a little modern Americana.",

Now- it's one of my favorite restaurants and I cannot get enough of it.    I cannot rave enough about the food... I have had the Mussels, Brussel sprouts, Baked Camembert, Cauliflower, Mac and Cheese and have loved all of those small plates.  Amazing is how to define the Brussel sprouts in one word actually.  Entree wise I have nibbled on my husband's Butcher burger (so good and they only make 20 a day), the scallops and the skirt steak... Loved it all too.    The service has been spectacular each of the 3 times I have gone.  The Bourbon list is massive, and the drinks are top notch.  I highly recommend this amazing place.",

Our server was the bartender for the upstairs bar. Needless to say he was very busy and made it to our \"table\" only twice. Altogether disappointed for a grand total of $350.  Another night friends from out of town wanted to go there to try some of the whiskeys. Ok. Sounded great, until we decided to eat. Nope. No tables. Only serving apps at the bar, not al, of us had bar stools and had to stand for over an hour. Just uncomfortable and chaotic.  But we have gone there and had delicious food! Brussels sprouts? Who knew they could taste that good?! Be warned though, there were no main dishes that are offered that were vegan. All have meat and cheeses. The seasonal salads I've had were good.  I will not return and drop hundreds $$$$ for spotty and chaotic service and a limited menu.  But the bourbon is great!",

The good: --The decor and atmosphere are a lot of fun --The quality of most of the dishes was very high. The Pig Wings were especially tasty and we also really liked the mussels, the octopus special and the eggplant special (all on the small plates menu). --The almond cake for dessert was great. --I liked the PunKing on draft (something new for me, almost more like a cocktail than a beer).  The less good: --The upstairs was noisier than I'd like--even our waitress commented on it--though I don't think that would stop us from going back. --My husband's Vieux Carre was pleasant but not outstanding.  The bad: --Our small table was ludicrously out of proportion with the very large plates some of our dishes arrived on.  Think tiny Parisian cafe table and square plates at least a foot on each edge (much bigger than needed to accommodate the food). We had ordered multiple small plates that were intended to be spaced out, but even so, we had to initially refuse one dish when it arrived because there was no place to set it. The plates we were eating from were of necessity so close to the edge of the table that if anyone had bumped the large plate in the middle they would have fallen off.  It felt like someone just hadn't thought this through. --The Brussels sprouts others have liked were a big disappointment (much too greasy).  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves, but the problem with the small size of our table did detract from the experience.",

We sat at a huge table made for 8 (there were 5 of us) right beside big garage doors that opened to the outside.  It was a perfect day in Pittsburgh for sitting outside.  We ordered the bread with dips for $5.  SOOOOO worth it.  We loved the hummus, tappanade (sp?), and ricotta spreads.  We shared salads.  I didn't LOVE my ceasar but my mom got the salad that was in season and her and my daughter just gobbled it up.  I ordered the Wagyu Flank Steak.  It was delicious.  My mom and daughter got the scallops.  I would get them the next time.  Melt in your mouth GOOD.  My dad got the chicken and he's pretty picky.  He really liked it.  And my friend got the sea bass.  Just excellent.    We all tasted each others dinner and there was not one bad meal.  We then shared a Smore dessert.  It was nice.  Mom and I had a glass of champagne.  Our whole order came to about $220.  Then I had to tip.  And actually, for the quality of the food, I thought it was quite reasonable.  We were so impressed that me and my two girls went back two nights later before seeing The Wedding Singer at the Benedum.  This time my daughter ordered the Dirty Pasta.  She didn't love it and ate my scallops.  Darn her.  But I loved it.  Rich, but delightful.  We also got the Fried Brussel Sprouts.  I hate brussels.  But my daughter loves them. Well, i will tell you....BAM....SOOO GOOD.  Just get them.  Trust me.  So, so good.  Overall, go to this place.  You will NOT be disappointed.",

I've dealt with him on 3 separate occasions where he was just blatantly rude to a degree I have never experienced in the service industry.  Openly mocking me and treating me so terribly that my date told him flat out he's being a dick.  He was nice to my date for the rest of the evening but not me.  We were going to stay for the rest of the night b/c we love the cocktails there but he absolutely ruined our moods so we left and went elsewhere.  I ended up paying for the meal so his being nice to my date was fruitless for him because, for the first time in my life, I gave well below my standard 30% tip.    I normally would not have gone on this rant publicly and figured that, perhaps, he just remembered me those three times and I 'rubbed him the wrong way', but just yesterday my friend told me about a nearly identical experience she had with him.  I spoke to another friend of mine and the, \"oh, the asshole Asian guy?!\" response says this is just his method of operation.  He deters us from wanting to return.  If he hates serving people drinks so much he should seek employment in another field.",

    "text": "Time for a comprehensive review. Took my wife and daughter here on Saturday May 12th. Will go down the list.  Crispy Pig Wing - Awesomely delicious. 5 stars. Pig Candy - Awesomely delicious. 5 Stars. Mac & Cheese - Awesomely delicious - 5 Stars Lion's Tail (cocktail) - Great cocktail. A True man's drink! Moscow Mule (cocktail - minus jalapeno) - My wife absolutely loved it.  These were our appetizers.  No time fore the main courses.  We purchased 3.  Hanger Steak (medium) - Awesomely delicious - 5 stars  Scallops - 4 stars. Scallops were cooked to perfection.  Asparagus cooked to perfection.  However I took issue with the blue crab risotto. My wife loved it.  For me, the taste was good, but it had a \"This will get old fast\" type of taste.  I can't explain it.  But I knew that I could not finish a bowl of that risotto.  After a few bites, I was done.  Overall I thought the dish was good. My wife would order this dish again without a doubt.  RABBIT \"COQ AU VIN\" - 3 stars - This was a good dish.  The highlight of the dish was the crispy chicken skin in my opinion. The dish itself was well put together.  There was no aspect of the dish that I disliked.  But the fact of the matter is that this dish didn't make me want to slap my mama.  It was good.  It wasn't great.  I would not order it again. I will enjoy eating the leftovers tonight, no doubt.  But I though the rabbit could have been prepared in a more memorable way.  Dessert - We had the apple Pie\", which has a salted caramel theme. Comes with a side of creme cheese. - 5 stars - Awesomely delicious.  Overall, we would definitely go back.  An interesting thing about this place.  This is the only place we ever went to that has such a large alcohol selection, the bar tender uses a ladder to get to all the bottles.  Their cocktail menu is stupendous.  The atmosphere is excellent.  We will be going back!",

    "text": "VERDICT:  A higher-brow, alternative to it's cousin down the street (Meat & Potatoes) with inventive small plates, and a truly stellar selection of bourbon.  SERVICE: Good, as expected for a place at this price point. Servers are friendly, attentive, and will bring you an iPad to browse their extensive bourbon list. We were seated at the bar while the rest of our party arrived and were seated as soon as our table was ready, so no complaints here.  FOOD: I was here with a larger group (8 people) and would absolutely recommend doing it this way. Butcher and the Rye has a variety of small plates and the more people you have, the more you can try, without breaking the bank. Options run the gamut from French Onion soup, to sashimi, to pate, as well as more exotic game, like rabbit and quail.   The sashimi held its own against offerings from Umi or Penn Avenue Fish Company, and the ponzu sauce that came with it was different and delicious. On the meat front, the pate and pork terrine were tender and flavorful; the braised beef cheeks in the Shepherd's Pie and the flank steak were of high quality, but over seasoned. For a cheese course, we elected to have the baked camembert, which was forgettable, and would definitely have benefited from the addition of some honey. I did not sample, but heard good things from my fellow diners about the brussels sprouts and the mac n cheese.   My one general issue with the food was that a lot of it felt fussy and overcomplicated, with ingredients/garnishes/reductions for the sake of show rather than flavor. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, and I feel the food could stand on its own with fewer distractions.   AMBIENCE: Butcher and the Rye has a lovely rustic, yet modern/trendy feel to it, with a juxtaposition of wood and metal. The wall of bourbon is a focal point in the main area and wooden benches add a welcoming country kitchen feel. The semi-private room at the front is bounded by floor to ceiling windows. If it's cold out, it can get pretty chilly, so plan accordingly.  BOTTOM LINE: Skip it if you are a picky eater, but for those with an adventurous palate, it's definitely worth a visit.",

It is a super sexy and trendy restaurant, and man oh man was it packed full when we went.  We had a very small banquette table next to a big table of loud guys.  The service was adequate.  The music was loud.  The food was pretty good!  I loved the brussel sprouts.  Just not exactly a place for romance.",

The mushroom soup was tasty but the scallops were simply orgasmic (can I say that on yelp?)  The value is decent too at $10/cocktail and $20-$30 per entree.  Bartender's whimsy for a flip-like cocktail was also a hit. All in all, I would definitely return here, even if I had to pay my own dime next time ;)  Update: I returned the next night with a coworker and it was even better. The bartender, Ryan (I think that was his name... I delayed too long in updating the review!) made some more excellent cocktails and we had some more excellent food.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place, as a lover of quality dining and an impassioned imbiber of all things bourbon.  The reviews and word-of-mouth had reeled me in with promises that, sadly, may have worked against the actual experience.  My review is a combination.  In terms of atmosphere and cocktails, I'd go with a 4-star experience.  I loved the drinks and the fact they attempt to keep it seasonal, and the overstuffed chairs in our top level seating, overlooking the massive wall of whiskey, added to the cool vibe (think dimly lit hipster lodge).  The waitress was attentive, but almost too much so.  I realize it's difficult to get reservations unless you plan ahead, so clearly they're busy, but it felt like she wanted us in and out as quickly as possible.  She wasn't overtly rude, but it's just the impression I was left with.  Then comes the food.  This is where I'd give only 2 stars.  We tried the mac and cheese app (not my choice, but in a marriage, all things are compromise, even appalling appetizer decisions at an expensive restaurant).  It was, by all accounts, mac and cheese.  Nothing at all special about it, other than the four cheeses.  But seriously, whose mac and cheese recipe doesn't call for multiple cheeses?  Not impressed.  Then came the pasta and fish entrees.  My better half liked the pasta and was satisfied, because of course the base of the dish is a starch.  For the tiny piece of fish I received, and the two gnocchi and small \"pile\" of greens that comprised the sides to round out the $30 entree, I left still feeling like I'd just had a snack before the real dinner.  I'm well versed in how different price to portion is in a restaurant that values quality over quantity, as opposed to the gluttony of food you get in a chain restaurant.  That being said, this stretched that way too much.  I'm fine with not feeling \"full\"...a good meal should make you feel satisfied, not weighed down.  But to still feel hungry is another story.    Long story short, I'd definitely go back for snacks and cocktails again in the future, but there are better restaurants in town at the same price point when it comes to the actual meal.",

    "text": "I can finally say I understand the hype that this place gets. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I haven't been here before--I have. It's just that both times when I was here before, I didn't get the appeal. We had mediocre service and my dish was undercooked. I was hesitant to feel completely negative about them; after all, they were new and I have never had an unenjoyable experience at their sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes.   Giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that perhaps they were working out the kinks (after all, they had just recently opened), we returned to tonight and I am so happy that we did.  We arrived slightly earlier than our reservation, so we had some time to sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly and helped my fiance pick out a whiskey from their enormous selection. Given the limited information my fiance gave him, the bartender was spot on and recommended a whiskey that he really enjoyed (Black Maple Hill). I ordered a Brandy En-Rouge and, spoiler alert, that's what I drank for the rest of the night, despite their extensive cocktail list, because if it ain't broke, why fix it, yaknowwhatimean?   We were seated soon thereafter and greeted by our really wonderful server, Stephani. She promptly refilled our water and replenished our cocktails. Bobby tried a whiskey flight, which he thoroughly enjoyed. For a starter, we split the Sunday Gravy and it was amazing. My taste buds were seriously having a dance party right there in my mouth. Soon after we were finished, a friendly guy came by to bus our dishes, and immediately had our silverware replenished and our waters topped off. Our water glasses never made it to empty the entire night.  On to the main course, my fiance had the skirt steak which looked amazing, and it was definitely cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the Dirty Pasta. And by enjoyed I mean it was definitely one of the best things I've ever eaten. The sauce was amazing and the pasta was cooked perfectly.   For dessert we split the du jour pot de creme (espresso with raspberry topping). I kid you not, I could have eaten like 7 of these. It was delicious.   Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded and loud, our seats felt intimate and we could hear each other talk the entire time. The restaurant was a little warm, but the food was totally unparalleled and the service was obsequious without being domineering. The atmosphere was trendy and cool, and the armchairs we sat in were so comfortable. I'm happy to see this place has finally found its groove.",

You get 3 spreads, including a citrus marmalade, an apple jam, and a honey butter. All were absolutely delicious and a great way to start the meal. We also tried the mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, and flank steak. I am a huge mac n cheese fan, and this mac n cheese was pretty good. The brussel sprouts really surprised me. They were served with chopped ham and onions, which really complimented the flavor. And my absolute favorite - the flank steak! It was served with fingerling potatoes and a delicious aioli that I really couldn't get enough of.  Service was okay, and it was very cold upstairs, but the venue itself is a much needed addition to Pittsburgh. The whiskey selection is incredible (I think the best in town?) and the bartenders are well trained. I might just have to start leaving work earlier to make it here for a post-work drink - I feel like it would draw a great crowd.",

We almost did not come here because we were in town with our 8 year old daughter and didn't know that it would be an appropriate place for her. We had a quaint corner table in the bustling restaurant (on a Tuesday night!) and while there is no kids menu, she was happy with the macaroni and cheese and Brussel sprouts. Both were tasty for the kid, but don't be fooled! These are amazing dishes, best we had, for adults too. Casoulet was great but the scallops were the star. Smores desert yet another shining moment in what was all around an impeccable dining experience!!",

You can also order sourdough for $5, though I wasn't much a fan of the bread. The main courses were tasty and well prepared. The service was quick and the atmosphere was cool and fun.

The details from the time you walk inside including beautiful velvet wallpaper to multi-tiered liquor storage at the bar, are incredible and have you looking in every direction possible while waiting for your meal.  We sat in the third floor lounge, at a low table with sofa seating that was perfect for my husband and I to enjoy a light dinner and dessert.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was full of flavor and topped with crunchy panko for a great balance.  My husband ordered the crispy pig wings which he absolutely loved and said the portion was just right to satisfy his hunger but not overstuff him.  But the dessert...the dessert was incredible!  We ordered the deconstructed s'mores with brown butter fried ice cream and it was every bit as amazing as that sounds.  To top everything off, our server was fantastic.  I would recommend a visit to anyone considering dinner in the 'burgh and definitely get some dessert afterwards!",

They did an amazing job with the interior design of this restaurant; it seems like a never ending labyrinth of cool things stashed everywhere. Unfortunately the high cool factor does not outweigh the \"just fine\" food.   I tried 4 dishes, the cauliflower, their take on Banh Mi, bucheron (a cheese and beets dish), and one of the nightly specials, a veal and polenta dish. The winner of the 4 was the cauliflower dish, it was an awesome combination of textures, saltiness, creaminess, freshness. This dish was the winner of the night. All other were just OK. Their play on the Banh Mi is a pork terrine with Bahn Mi flavors. Until I went back and read the description I never would have known that this was supposed to resemble a Banh Mi. The bucheron was fine, and the veal and polenta dish tasted just like a decent pot roast. There just wasn't anything about the food that makes me want to rush back here.  I'm not writing Bucher and the Rye off just yet, I just wished it lived up a little closer to my expectations.",

    "text": "This is probably on the low end of a 4 for me.     What's good:  - The ambiance - The place is stunning, with lots of rustic and modern touches kind of mixed together.  There is a wall of bourbon and whiskey bottles behind the bar, many of which are accessed with a library ladder.  Lots to look at and enjoy at this place.    - The service - Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.   The only criticism I had was that when several of us ordered two appetizers as our meals, her default was to serve them together.  I get it, the place is packed and you turn tables over faster that way, but I would have preferred an option and she phrased it as a \"this is what's going to happen unless you want to object\" kind of thing.    - The variety - The menu was filled with yummy looking things that I wanted to try.     What's so-so:   - The food - or rather, the consistency of the food.  I ordered the Crispy Pig Wing, which was downright delicious. The bone marrow, however, was less than stellar.  Further, it was TINY.   Maybe a tablespoon of marrow on a single bone.  I honestly think that bone was just cut unevenly, because one of my companions had a bone with a much deeper groove.  She probably had at least 3 times as much marrow as I did.  They ought to know better than to serve such vastly different portions to the same table (or at all really).  The skimpy serving ruined an otherwise really tasty dish.  Both dishes also could have been a tad warmer. - The value - I don't mind small portions at all, but some of my companions had dishes that seemed pretty skimpy for what they paid.  The burrata for example, was very small.  We had considered splitting it as an app, but I'm glad we didn't because it would have been about a bite each.   For $12 or $15 or something...can't remember the exact price, but I do recall thinking that it was outrageous once the dish appeared.  - The bathroom.   So the stall doors are about waist high, which means that,  anyone standing on the other side of the door can pretty much see your lady parts.   Bad form, Butcher, bad form.",

    "text": "I went for dinner with a Client last week while in town for business.  We sat at the bar and I immediately noticed the most impressive whiskey wall,(predominantly Bourbon) I have even seen outside of The Library in NYC.  They have it all.  THE STAFF: The female bartender Maggie was fantastic.  She was attentive, engaging and knowledgeable.  She spoke to us just enough to make us feel more than welcome without interrupting our business dinner.   The other bartender. Well, all I will say is he was not as interested in being there and seem liked he was having a bad night and wanted out ASAP.  But enough about that.   THE FOOD: My Client had the hanger steak and I had the wagu beef steak.  Both we amazing! Also very reasonably priced at $22 and $28.  Cooked to perfection, portion was perfect.  Absolutely spot on!   THE BOOZE: They have every whiskey known to mankind, and a very up to date prohibition style cocktail menu.  They have a great signature list as well.  Here is the issue. The pricing was beyond sky high! It was as, if not more expensive than Manhattan.  Actually it was like Dubai not Pittsburgh.   EXAMPLE: The Woodford Reserve Sonoma Cutrer Bourbon which is one of my favorites that Chris Morris of Woodford makes.  It's something I look for and generally,( from low end to high) around $18-$35. This is across the country, from LA to Denver to Houston and Boston.  I travel a lot for business and I can stand firm on this pricing model.  Well, here it was $90 for a two ounce pour. OUCH!! And most of the cool whiskeys like this were outrageous. I won't dwell on the negative pricing anymore.    IN CLOSING: I certainly don't want this to be a negative at all because I loved the place and will definitely visit again when I'm back in PBGH.  However their booze pricing needs to be examined. It was the difference between a 5 star review and 4 starts for me.  If they get the pricing to just industry standard, it will be a grand slam.  I also want to try their other restaurant Meat & Potatoes. I heard it was spectacular as well.",

    "text": "I am not from Pittsburgh and when I was looking for a restaurant open near my hotel, I stumbled into this little gem of a restaurant. The dark, lofty, eclectic atmosphere was pleasant and welcome after a long day of tourism! I ordered a glass of Pino Noir and, while it was a very fine selection, it was $12.00 - a fact unknown to me until I got the check. However, it must've had a pretty high alc content because it did the job of two glasses of the crap I buy at home. We were seated upstairs in very close quarters to the tables on either side of us - don't expect privacy here. But my husband and I love people watching so we were not put off by being subjected to the DB sitting next to us trying to impress the girl we believe he met online. It was a form of entertainment. My husband spent a good 10 mins perusing the VERY extensive whiskey menu and decided on the Angel's Envy. What a treat! Truly a flavorful blend to savor slowly, first with the olfactory then orally. One can smell the unique ingredients. I plan to buy a bottle of this \"nectar of the gods\" for my boss at Christmas. It's definitely a bone warmer. We ordered a cheese tray appetizer. I was expecting a few triangles of Cheddar. What we got was a smattering of four specialty cheeses - each with opposing flavors - designed, I believe, to wake up your taste buds and remind them that there are still unique flavors in the world! My favorite thing about this tray was the sweet peach jelly infused with a touch of Mustard oil. There's a name for this lovely combination. But I forgot it. Our entree's were the Shephard's Pie and the Flank Steak. The Pie was wonderful. The meat was so tender it melts in your mouth. The flank steak was way way way too salty. I ate it all after those two $12 glasses of super charged Pinot Noir and chased it with 3 glasses of water. I don't think my Sober tongue would have done so well. Steve was a very patient, awesome, friendly server. We asked him more questions than any diner at 10pm on a Saturday night has a right to ask. We tipped him well. Overall, this is definitely a place foodies should try and meat & potato peeps like me should experience!",

    "text": "I wasn't sure if I was going to like Butcher & the Rye as much as I did, but I loved everything from start to finish. It was a belated Birthday dinner for myself by my mother in law. We had reservations made with a request for a non communal table and we were seated on the first floor in a corner of the restaurant, spectacular table to observe all the action going on around us. Decor was great, rustic reclaimed wood wall panels, mixed with a retro wallpaper, sort of a rustic cabin meets a speak easy. Service was great...maybe one of the best Manhattans I've ever had. My wife had the cauliflower appetizer that was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the pig candy, perfectly crispy pork belly. For the entree I got the short rib, which was excellent, but a little overly fatty it was served over a homemade version of baked beans and not your typical baked beans, not very saucy, but very flavorful. My wife got the recommended wagyu flank steak which was extremely good with its bacon vinaigrette and fingerling potatoes, my mother in law ordered the scallops over blue crab risotto which she raved of. It was a very good Birthday dinner and I will return!!",

    "text": "I went last night with my fiancee for my birthday and it being our 5 year anniversary since meeting.  The dinner did not disappoint.  I highly suggest the Acacia red wine.  Very affordable and drinkable.  It is exactly what I want in a dinner wine.  Although I ordered seafood, I still like my red wine.  For the evening, we had the focaccia bread appetizer, I ordered the scallops for entree, my fiancee ordered the hamburger special for the day, and dessert was pumpkin cheesecake.  Everything was awesome. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was the best.  It definitely left me wanting more.  Dessert was perfect  not your typical pumpkin cheesecake, and the fruit garnish/syrup was a nice touch and contrast to the sweetness of the dessert.  I only wish that they had espresso for after dinner!  I wanted a pick me up before the show, but stayed with my last glass of water to finish off the meal.  Melissa was our waitress, and she did a great, great job of making recommendations.  She did convince me to switch to white wine for the entree, and I am glad that I did.  Thanks, Melissa!",

    "text": "The food here is really good. As a group, we went for scallops (outstanding!), pig wing (succulent, tender), brussel sprouts (i want to eat them again today), and roast chicken (tender, juicy, rich and flavorful). We really enjoyed the food. The portions are small, but I've decided that's a good thing, even though you pay the same as you'd pay for larger portions elsewhere. Basically, there's no chance you're going to be uncomfortable and regret eating too much of X. Service was also pretty good. No complaints. Because the weather was really nice, we wanted to eat outside. The outside part of Butcher and the Rye is not so nice. This isn't their fault, but I wouldn't eat outside again. Sixth avenue is a busy corridor for two things that will bug the hell out of you while eating dinner: 1) Port Authority busses belching fumes and making noise; and 2) Downtown drunks belching fumes and making noise. And I don't mean the kinds of drunks that trip over their high heels and screech at their friends... these would have been ok; I mean the kinds of drunks that drool and fart and beg for change while tripping over their shoe laces. So, go for the food, and eat indoors, and you'll enjoy it.",

However several were a bit greasy. My friend ordered the pig candy and had to send it back. She found it way to fatty and gelatinous. They do have some interesting cocktails and a good wine list. We drank the red wine that was on special ($8 vs $13) and were quite pleased with it. The space is beautiful and nicely decorated. It wasn't overly noisy; we were able to hold a conversation and hear each other. Our server was helpful in explaining the menu.",

There were five of us, so were able to order quite a few plates (I'd recommend doing this if you could).  Here's what we had, all were very good, and we've already made reservations for next week...  -Pig Candy :  Pork Belly with kimchi.   -Mac & Cheese : Ohhhhhhhhh...this was soooo good.  MUST try, even if you don't like Mac & Cheese.   -Roasted Brussel Sprouts : Yum!   -Shishito Peppers : Very good.  Not hot but a little bit of spice. -Mussels : Didn't try them myself (not a fan) but the others said they were very good.  My main entree was the Dirty Pasta (pasta with Rabbit meat).  Also very good!    Also, if you are a whiskey drinker, this place is heaven.  The bar has a ceiling high display with various selections.    Price wasn't too bad...averaged $50/person but that included each person averaging a tapas plate, a main entree and a couple of drinks.",

Pate was fantastic...best I have EVER had and the scallops....I am salivating just thinking about them.  Honestly cannot wait for the next trip to Pittsburgh to visit again.  And if you are a whisky drinker ask for the menu....daughter the bartender had a blast trying to figure out which of the tasty selections to imbibe upon.  Be sure to make reservations...even during the week!  Thanks for making our first trip to Pittsburgh even better!",

The brussel sprouts were tasty and the highlight of the meal. We waited too long for them to bring our entrees out, and when they got to the table they were both luke warm. It's clear someone had forgotten about them and they were likely sitting under a lamp in the kitchen. The food itself was ok. My halibut was over salted and my friend's risotto was (for lack of a better term) eh. Probably not likely to go back. Better food in Pittsburgh exists.",

    "text": "8 of us went here last night and I have to say, I don't know what these other yelpers are complaining about (except the bathrooms which I will get to later) - it is awesome!  Pricey, yes, but awesome.   First off, the decor.  When you walk in, you just know that the place is going to be good.  The bourbon bar downstairs is epic.  It has a ladder to reach the top bottles like you see in a library, very cool.  We ended up sitting upstairs which was part library, part taxidermy museum.  So long as you won't be offended sitting under a deer head (and if you are, this is not the place for you), the decor works with what they are trying to pull off her.    Second, the drinks.  Most of us ordered some bourbon drink, whether mixed or straight.  While I do think that $20 bucks for 2 ounces is a bit excessive, I stuck to the mixed drinks.  I had the Pittsburgh Smash - fruit, whiskey, blackberry goodness and the Whiskey Daisy - which I just loved saying and the flavor matched up to the adorable name.  My husband got beer and was really pleased with the selection except the special Church Brew Works light beer which was too bubbly, almost like the fermentation was off.   Third, the food!  Oh, the food.  We split things, we hoarded things for ourselves, it was all awesome.  J and I split the camembert which was definitely the low-point of the night for me.  I make baked brie all the time for special events and I have to say that mine is better.  Beyond, that, I can't even comprehend how they made some of these dishes.  Each was better than the one before it.  So in order of awesomeness, with the last dish being the most awesome: Baked camembert  Baked apple Betty - Not enough ice cream for one, too much sauce for another.  It was basically like a apple crisp that wasn't crispy enough.  Fried brussels - these are amazing.  These make people that hate brussels say, oh, really, these are brussel sprouts?  Yes, my friend, yes, they are.   Rice cakes - I know, I thought the same thing.  Dry, brittle, diet food in a place like this?  But no.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, these are pillows of rice goodness.  Covered in a spicy ssauce that has more of a kick at the end, these astound me.  Seriously.   Fish platter special - oysters, smoked mussels, shrimps with the heads on, whitefish salad, gigantic crab legs.  It was a bit pricey -$49 bucks - but the seafood was pretty out of this world fresh and delicious.  I loved the smoked mussels cause they are always delicious and the shrimp were mammoth.   Pig candy - Pork belly in a spicy, sweet sauce.  It was amazing.  I think my husband wanted to divorce me and marry it.  It's that good.   Fourth, the bathrooms.  This is why they don't get 5 stars.  When asked about why the bathrooms are so freaking weird, the waitress told us that it's a different kind of place and they are trying to do something different.  There is good different and bad different and this is definitely bad different.  I had read the reviews, so I knew what to expect, but it is even weirder in person.  The stalls only go up to right above your waist and are huge, so you can totally, if you are into that sort of thing, check out the person with you using the bathroom.  There are only two stalls, so I am not sure what you do if you are the third person waiting.  Stare at the ceiling?  There is a lock on the door to completely cut out anyone from entering while you are in there, but these seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Seriously.",

Apparently it's hard to get reservations, but our friends were able to make some and we sat at a cool open-air table.   The foccacia bread was so-so, but totally made up for by the wagyu burger that was on the list of specials. Served piping hot, it was the perfect done-ness, and the cheese (supposedly made in house also) was the icing on the...burger. The fries were delicious, too.   Since I usually avoid menu items like dirty pasta with ground duck meat (another of their offerings, which I'm told is amazing), I was glad to be able to get something that was so, well, normal, in such a trendy place.   Only slightly negative comment is that the service was a bit slow, even though we mentioned we were trying to catch a show after. Our reservations were an hour and 45 minutes before our show started across the street, and we just made it as the lights were dimming!",

    "text": "Disappointed.   I gave this joint two shots...two...  Three things I love - going to restaurants, trying new things, and my birthday. So when planning my birthday dinner and discovering that this place was opening that weekend, I thought, perfect - three of my favorite things!  Now, mind you, this is probably two weeks out from my birthday dinner. So i find the number, give them a call, and I reach a recording where I was unable to leave a message. Fine. So I call Meat and Potatoes, their sister restaurant, and I speak with the hostess there who tells me that Butcher and the Rye isn't taking reservations for the first two weeks that they are open. Fine. So I contact my dinner guests, they are fine with winging it without a reservation. We figured we'd go on the early side as we anticipate a bit of a wait.   We arrive at 7:30 on the first Saturday they are open, get to the host stand, and they asked us if we had a reservation. Excuse me? \"I was told you weren't taking reservations for the first two weeks.\" Response: \"Well, on Tuesday of this week we got so many requests for reservations we had to start taking them.\" Really? \"We can have a table for you at 1045.\" Again, really?   So we decided to have a drink there and call some other places to get a table for dinner. We sat at the bar upstairs, while three or four tables behind us were empty with reservation signs on them. There were only two small groups of people at the bar including us, and I had to flag one of the two bartenders down to get their attention to my empty drink that had been sitting on the bar for at least five minutes.   We were there for about 45 minutes, and when we left there was still one open table that could have seated us. Now, having worked at restaurants for most of my late teens and early twenties I understand that you have to make room for reservations, but restaurants should also know how to turn tables quickly to accommodate walk ins (there were only three of us!).   Long story short, I decided to chalk it up to management needing to fine tune some things after the first weekend. Needing a place for dinner for the Friday after Thanksgiving, I decided to give them another shot. I made a reservation for eight, tried to bump it up to nine, but they said the most people they could accommodate at one table was eight. Fine.  When we got there, they asked us if we had reservation before we even entered the door. Yes. Then we got to the host stand - they asked us again if we had a reservation.  Yes, but it's down to seven - someone bailed last minute. The hostess did a bit of scurrying, asking probably a manger if we could still have the table they had for us with only seven. That person said yes. Then they said that two guests had arrived and were at the bar. We go see them, and our two guests were the ones that said our table was ready, the hostess didn't let us know even though we had walked right by the room with our table.    They had us in the front room with the big picnic table and the floor to ceiling window. The table and room could have comfortably accommodated ten people, but my request for nine was denied. And it was freezing. I couldn't take my coat off the entire dinner. Pretty dismal.  The food was...meh. We ordered lots of apps to share and it was quite comical because one person did the ordering, and all the food was served to her, despite it being quite obvious that all these dishes had been ordered was for the table and not just for her. Drinks took awhile to come, but the servers and food runners were very nice...so they had that going for them...  Needless to say, disappointed. Great atmosphere, cool because it's new, but probably wouldn't hit it up as dinner spot again any time soon.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my fiance and 2 other dining companions for dinner.  Upon entering Butcher and the Rye I was sort of surprised by the decor but also thought that it was pretty cool with the first thing catching my eye the large and tall displays of Whiskey behind the bar.  Since we arrived about 5 minutes after our reservation time (crazy theater traffic) we were immediately shown to our table and I didn't get to see as much downstairs as I would have liked.  As we headed up the first set of stairs I thought it was cool that they had a couple of different levels and then we headed up to a third level which had a bar and some lounge type seating.  We ended up being sat in the lounge type seating which meant that my fiance and I were stuck on a long couch that had a back about 2 feet behind us while our dining companions were stuck on some tiny stools.  What kind of table is that for people that made their dinner reservations 6 weeks earlier?  By the time we had finished dinner and our desserts I was more than ready to have something to lean my back against.  Other than the weird seating that we were provided the top floor was pretty cool and gave all of us a hunting lodge type feel including a wood ceiling that made you feel like you were in a log cabin.  I decided to start off my evening with one of their cocktails since I had read many people raving about them on Yelp.  So I went with the Butcher Sour which consisted of Bulleit Rye, an egg white, lemon and bitters.  It was a pretty good drink which I enjoyed sipping throughout dinner. For dinner I decided on splitting the mac n cheese and Brussels sprouts with my fiance while getting the dirty pasta for myself.  After we had ordered the waitress told us that items here come as they are ready from the ktichen and she certainly wasn't kidding.  First up was the mac n cheese which was pretty amazing.  As a matter of a fact I think it might be the best mac and cheese that I have had in Pittsburgh.  It was very decadent and rich with a number of different cheeses that had the perfect amount of gooiness to them.  In the middle of eating the mac and cheese our Brussels Sprouts came out.  They were also delicious with the sprouts being cooked very crispy with the brown butter, parmesan and lemon aioli giving them some nice depth although honestly they were good enough that I probably could have been just as happy without most of that.  As we were finishing that the Dirty Pasta's came out and so there were two of us eating our main dishes while the others had nothing in front of them.  The dirty pasta was easily my least favorite dish of the evening and consisted of ground duck, strozzapretti, sage, brandy and pecorino romano.  It started out well enough and I loved the ground duck but eventually the salt in the sauce became too much for me and by the end of the bowl I was not enjoying it at all.  I was also able to try my fiances wagyu flank steak which was cooked nicely and which she loved.  After we had all finished our meals both of the ladies at our table ordered deep fried brownie for dessert.  After a fairly long wait and an apology from the waitress the brownies were delivered to the table.  Both of the ladies raved about how good they were with the outside of the brownie being a little hard while the inside was gooey.  The bottom line for me is that I can't really see myself coming back to the Butcher and the Rye too soon in the future.  While some of my dishes like the Brussels and mac and cheese were absolutely amazing I can't say that I was too happy with my main dish nor with our seating.   My fiance also encouraged me to give this 4 stars as she enjoyed her experience but mine was a little less enjoyable with my too salty main dish.",

    "text": "For a while now I was eagerly awaiting the opening of Butcher and the Rye as I have enjoy my trips to Meat and Potatoes for both food and drink. So on a Thursday night I headed over for a few drinks.   Upon first entering, the place looks great - nice atmosphere, modern meets butcher shop in the woods - and then you come upon the wall of whiskey...holy smokes. So I walked over to the bar to grab a drink....and thats where it started to go south...  Now I came to check out the whiskey and they do have a very impressive collection - in fact one of the best that I have come across. I enjoy the brown liquors in all forms and really enjoy those times when I run across something new, especially if it is something that I say \"wow, I want to own a bottle of that\", so when I run across a place I can dive head first into trying, I'm in heaven.   I asked for whiskey menu and was handed an iPad - cool idea to convey info about the booze and a way they can keep it up to date with what they have - except that it seemed like not even half of bottles were on it. Ok - first week, I can excuse that a little but not totally - if you are a touting your collection, get your menu right before you open. My friends and I tried to ask about a few different items behind the bar and one of the responses we were given was \"you'll have to ask (guy with the hat), he is the guy that knows the stuff the best\" - really? 400 bottles and only one person is knowledgable enough to answer questions.   Then came the sticker shock - their prices seem like they were set and they multiplied 2x. I have been to other places in this city (and others) that have a some of the same items and they were charging double for it. Now I realize that if you have a bottle of X and it is not something you will sell everyday so it will cost you a little more to keep it around, but when a 1 oz pour of that drink runs $15-25, it's putting a night of sampling in the $80-100 range for 4 oz of booze. I don't to sound cheap and I have my spent a fair share of money on good bottles over the years, but thats just it - I would rather take that $80-100 and go get myself a bottle - your atmosphere is not worth the mark up.   So my overall though is that they have a collection and just that - the place does not come across as someplace that you go to try and find new whiskeys, just a place to get a drink while staring at their wall of booze. It reminds me of the guy who owns 40 classic cars, but doesn't care to drive them.  I will say this, the staff was friendly and fairly attentive, so I don't want to sound like they were bad - they were good - same level I would expect in any place similar.   Now after writing this I might sound like a pretentious ass about whiskey (because I fairly new to a lot of it) - and maybe I am - but when I try and go someplace that touts their whiskey collection, I expect be able to experience new things while having a good time and not going broke. For me, B&R isn't that place....",

Now to the food; we had an array of four small plates (marrow, rabbit, cauliflower, salt cod). The food menu descriptions weren't entirely appetizing, but the presentation and taste exceeded our expectations ... Let's not forget about the whiskey!  The list is long and over whelming, but the wide range of origins brought a smile to my face.   If you're looking for a new place to try, add this to your list. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I know that this is their first week but this could be one of the best new restaurants in Pittsburgh. As a follow up to Meat & Potatoes, it is clearly a superior effort by Chef Richard DeShantz. Bourbon & Rye may be a key feature of this restaurant but the bar doesn't dominate the space like it does at Meat & Potatoes.  We arrived with no reservation tonight and were offered a table inside with an hour and a half wait or an outdoor table on Sixth St. at which we could dine immediately. We chose to sit outside and dine al fresco.  The few outdoor tables had heaters above them that made it quite comfortable to dine outside on a fall night.  We decided not to delve into one of the 350 bourbons that they claimed to have and instead ordered a pair of whiskey based cocktails.  My wife had a Butcher Sour and I chose the Pittsburgh Smash with Wigle Rye.  The Smash was just what I wanted.  The blackberries, mint and lime gave the drink a nice, tart note.    Our server went through the menu with us quickly and explained that the dishes are smaller plates and designed to be shared.  We ordered the cauliflower, oxtail manicotti, rabbit saddle and octopus.    If I were to do it again, I would not order the rabbit.  Not because it was bad but more because it just didn't feel like a complete dish.  There were too many components and it made it hard to get everything into a single bite.    The cauliflower and the octopus really stood out. As a vegetable dish, the cauliflower came with farro and felt like a complete entree instead of just some vegetarian side.  The octopus was super tender and the spicy sauces really brought it home.  My wife is also a sucker for scallops and garbonzo beans.  The octopus dish had both.    I don't want to leave out the manicotti because it was also good but just not as AMAZING as the other two.  I really liked the idea of the pickled apple on top and the fresh fennel. Typically. you would see the apple as the fresh component with pickled fennel so this was a nice twist on complimenting flavors.  We split the german chocolate for dessert.  This is more of a deconstructed twist on german chocolate cake with rich chocolate sorbet and a gooey butter cake. It was tasty and it wasn't too sweet, which is what I like at the end of the meal.  There are two things that I would change. First of all, most of the dishes were garnished with a weird type of green that had been fried. It was too big, got in the way and didn't add any flavor. It was also greasy.  The second issue was that it was a little pricey. Definitely higher than Meat & Potatoes and the portions are tapas to appetizer sized.  Overall, this is a great addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene and downtown.  We will be back for sure.",

Maybe it's because I just moved from a place where restaurants like this are a dime a dozen, but I really didn't get what all the fuss was about.   We were seated on time and had no issues with the service. Started our meal with a charcuterie board (this was the best thing we ordered, definitely worth getting!!) and the pork belly appetizer. The pork belly was good but not great. Didn't quite melt in your mouth, was a bit rubbery feeling.  For the entree I ordered a seasonal special of smoked chicken. Again, good not great. My fiance got the flank steak which I had a bite of. Wish I had ordered that. Another person with us had the dirty pasta which everyone raved about but I didn't try.  Rounded out dinner by sharing three desserts: cheesecake, apple pie, and and smores. The smores and apple pie were very good. Cheesecake was meh.   For a total bill of $150 for two people and an average dinner, won't be back any time soon. Not worth it for the money in my opinion.",

From the $10 salad that was smaller than a side salad and had no taste to the $30 bland pasta to the tiny \"measured\" pours of whiskey. Awful experience. I asked the bartender what his favorite whiskey is. He tells me Bookers Rye. We were talking proof and I knew Bookers was high because I've had it before. What he failed to tell me was when he muttered 100 in a noisy restaurant he wasn't talking proof to my surprise. He was actually saying $100 per ounce. When I ordered another, he again didn't say a word. Not until my bill comes do I notice that the bill is $200 more for two 1oz shots. The entire bottle is $300 upon using google. Maybe train your bartenders to let people know when they're paying that high a price for a single 1oz pour and confirm it. Hell it didn't even get poured to the top of your little measuring contraption. Thanks for the suggestion pal! I'll never recommend this place. Train your bartenders to maybe not suggest $100 shots when an average out of towner wants to try different things. This isn't normal. Oh and for anyone who comes here, make sure you ask your bartenders how much their overpriced ridiculous prices of whiskey is before it's served. Thanks for the half ass \"Oh. Sorry\" when I was shocked by the bill too.",

The decor in this place is nothing short of amazing.  It reminds me a lot of a speakeasy in NYC called \"Please Don't Tell.\" No detail was left untouched.    We ordered the Rye whiskey flight, a Moscow Mule and decided to snack on the Dirty Pasta.  Our drinks were served quickly and the food followed shortly after.  The whiskey flight was enjoyable, our bartender brought the three tasting glasses over to us and explained each one, recommending order in which we should drink them.  The Moscow Mule was well done, not the best in the city in my opinion (hop on over to Acacia for that one), but delicious nonetheless.    Now, on to the Dirty Pasta. Oh. My. God.  Quite possibly one of the best dishes I've ever tasted.  Everything about it was perfect.  My only complaint would be that we ran out of noodles before everything else on the plate, but the ground duck/sage blend was too god to NOT eat by itself on a fork.  All in all, a wonderful evening and I highly recommend this for a date night, girls night, or pre/post theater-show drinks.  I will definitely be back very, very soon!",

Previously you would have to travel to another country or to a very fancy restaurant with any hope of eating such well prepared food. By fancy I only mean incredibly expensive and stuffy.

For the small plate, we split the marrow, which was surprisingly good. For dinner, I had the Dirty Pasta, which I highly recommend. It is very flavorful and filling. My husband had the Rabbit Coq Au Vin, which was also very good. You could definitely taste the red wine in the dish. Unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert. The only downside is how close together the tables upstairs on, but that is common practice is any of these restaurants, as it is the same at Meat and Potatoes and Cure.",

As industry employees, my person and I generally despise Yelp but James made our experience one of the most enjoyable nights out we have ever had together. We came to town for stupid touristy stuff and were sucked in by the wall of bourbon, which is as beautiful of a sight as it sounds. I started with a Salinger's Sling and my person got the Applejack Sazerac. His was a little boozy for my taste but he loved it, while mine was perfect for me. For the next round we rolled the dice and got some dealers choice cocktails, Basil Hayden for me, Bookers for my person. And again, they were perfect for both of us. Apps were the pan dripping sourdough and Mac and cheese. And it was STUPID how fast we ate these damn things. Mac and cheese had the perfect amount of crunch. It was just dumb how good they were. Entrees were the flank steak medium rare for me, and pappardelle for my person. We ended up being so full and still wanting dessert we split the remainder of our entrees in half so we could each take some of both. We are at this very moment sharing both of them and I personally want to cry tears of joy. James is fantastic, his recommendations will not disappoint. I would make the drive from Cleveland just for this ridiculous ice cream sandwich I'm shoving in my mouth right now. Bravo!",

    "text": "Cool interior.  I would agree with another reviewer, rustic yet modern, not stuffy.  Very busy when I went, 8pm dinner on a Friday night.  Good thing we had reservations or we would not have even been let into the bar area, guess it was already at capacity.  We were seated upstairs in the table area.  There's a second bar upstairs that's pretty cool too in addition to the one downstairs.  My husband complained that it was quite dark where we were seated and he couldn't read the menu.  Service was good but felt rushed.  The idea is to order a bunch of small plates to share and I asked the server if we should order them all at the same time or only one or two at a time.  She said to order all at one time and they just come out as they're ready.  Well all 6 or 7 seemed to come out within a 2 minute time span and my husband and I barely had room on our tiny table to hold all of the food.  This made it feel a little cramped and rushed.  However, the food itself tasted great.  I enjoyed everything we ordered.  Standouts include the pig candy (pork belly), the hanger steak and the salad with caesar dressing.  Drinks were fantastic.  Excellent bourbon selection.    My main issue with the place is the bathrooms!  ZERO privacy.  I mean, you walk in and you can see down into the two stalls easily and whatever the person is doing in the stall.  The stall door and walls only come up barely to your hipbone while standing.  Cross your fingers that you don't have and adverse GI issues after dinner or you're in trouble.  I'm not a prudish person but it was awkward, even just for a number 1!  I would go again, the food was worth another trip.  I will definitely order less plates at a time next time I go and that should solve the \"rushed\" issue.",

Our server, James, was incredibly passionate about the restaurant and gave us a brief backstory as well as his recommendations. Everything he said to try was amazing. Both of us had a nauti mule to start (get this if you like ginger/can handle a bit of spice). The brussel sprouts? The pig candy? Fahgetaboutit. So good. For our entrees, we had the dirty pasta and the rabbit coq au vin because we wanted to try something different and both dishes were packed with super delicious flavors and great portion sizes. Because this place is, arguably, more of a food experience, I'd recommend dessert too. We had deconstructed s'mores with deep fried ice cream.  This is an incredible date spot. Between the sexy atmosphere, the kick ass food, and the service, you could be there for a few hours enjoying yourself and not even realize!",

Our waitress Melissa put a real damper on our experience and it's been a while since I had such bad service.  When we sat down I asked if I could have lemons and a straw and they never came.  I had to get up and get it myself from the bar because I was do thirsty. We ordered drinks and they came after appetizers.  My friend ordered Chardonnay and my friend asked her where it was after we got our drinks and the way she answered my friend was really offensive and appalling.  She gave my friend a tremendous attitude and said \"I brought you the end of the bottle there in that glass, and I am going to take care of the rest of my section and after that I'll bring you more\". We looked at the glass had a few sips in it.  Then she brought her the rest and it was a different Chardonnay than what she brought in the first glass (the end if the bottle). It was yellow tail.  Then my friend got a 2nd glass and she brought a different Chardonnay again.  I've never ordered wine and had a waitress bring 3 different types of Chardonnay to 1 person.  She didn't check on us during our meal.  She was rude and unfortunately made it a bad experience.  The food tasted good.  It's a cute restaurant.  What a shame.",

However, for some reason, our waitress tonight was just absolutely unpleasant and unprofessional. I love to ask questions to know more about a dish's profile, and when I said \"I have another question,\" she rolled her eyes and said \"ok\" in a very condescending manner. Then, one of our party was looking through the pictures on yelp to make a final decision, and when the waitress was going through to take orders she lingered on her; so the others explained that she's trying to figure out what she wants. The waitress had the audacity to respond, \"On her phone? Has she even looked at the menu?\" Not to mention the rude tone, to top it off. First of all, Melanie, even if she were texting and ignoring you, your profession does not condone that kind of interaction with the customers. Please check your attitude. And no, trying to be nice the last two minutes with our table will not ensure you get your tip. It's unfortunate that a server can ruin the atmosphere for such a great restaurant.",

We arrived early hoping to get seated a little quicker, and they sat us just after 10pm. Perfect.  The interior is undoubtedly cool. So much detail! It really makes you forget that you're really sitting downtown Pittsburgh. We were seated at a table upstairs and had a great view of the antler chandelier. Loved the rustic cabin vibe.  Unfortunately, it wasn't an exceptional experience and the atmosphere couldn't override some of the issues. It was literally 80 degrees at our table and the A/C was off. The staff was sweating, we were sweating, the patrons at the tables around us were sweating and I have no idea why there was no air on! It was a 90 degree day! I heard people ask for the A/C to be cranked, but nothing ever changed. It was cooler at Heinz Field sitting in the sun the next day. Absolutely miserable! It was also so loud!! You could barely hold a conversation over the music.  We had the cheese platter as an appetizer. It was okay. Definitely not large enough for 5 people, but we kind of knew that. The waitress recommended me the Bee's Knees as a great drink, but I wasn't crazy about it. My Mom felt the same about the drink she ordered and they were really small for being $12 each. I ordered the Seared Scallops and really liked it! Everyone else also liked their food, but didn't really love it. My Dad capped off the meal with Strawberry pie. Same result. I think if we were comfortable the food would have gone over much better.   Service was on the slow side. Long waits in between courses and the check. Our waitress was super nice and attentive with the water though!   Just very hard for me to stomach paying hundreds on a nice dinner, when it wasn't that enjoyable. On the positive side, I think I sweat out 5lbs. of water weight. All jokes aside, I'd like to give it a second chance some day. It seems our experience wasn't the norm and people seem to love it. However, I don't think I'll hurry to make a reservation anytime soon.",

    "text": "Our meal at Butcher and Rye may well be our best meal of 2018 (pretty bold statement since the year is only half passed AND it's been a solid 3 months since we ate said meal).    I spent a lot of time pondering Yelp reviews and menus trying to pick a place for dinner our final night in Pittsburgh.  We've done so many of the usuals, yet haven't found that place that makes that meal you want every time you visit a city.  This. Is. It.  There were no reservations available, so we decided to take our chances and arrive at opening hoping to snag bar seats (our preferred location, anyway).  We arrived 5-10 minutes before opening and there was already a bit of a line, but we were still able to (easily) snag bar seats.    The bartender was fantastic and super helpful answering questions both about the menu and about bourbon (list is stellar, yet ridiculously overpriced:  you can find a comparable list, at close to 1/2 the pour price at Carmella's Plates and Pints on the south side.  You're welcome.)  We started with the Sunday Gravy and all those other reviewers who've championed it are right.  And I hate when that happens, as I'm always skeptical of the \"masses\".  They're right.    I had the scallops with blue crab risotto and I still routinely dream about this meal.  That hard sear, that creamy risotto... I was so enamored with my meal, I forget what my husband ate (though I'm sure I had at least a bite).  He says he had the filet and it, too, was delicious.    I love great food.  I hate paying top dollar for subpar \"fancy\".  This is great food worth every penny (note, I said \"food\", not \"bourbon\" ;) ).    We will be back.",

We initially made the reservation with the intentions of eating off of the restaurant menu but having never gone, there was too much on the regular menu to try!  We started with fresh focaccia that came with three spreads: ricotta, white bean, and an olive tapenade. All three were delicious and the bread was incredibly fresh.   Next up was Butcher's steak tartare. Ugh. Insanely good. This appetizer has everything I could want in a tartare! Capers, radishes, crusty bread, a truffled egg and a really good garlic aioli! There are three dishes in this world that get me truly excited, eggs benedict, Cuban sandwiches and steak tartare. This was they best I have ever had as far as tartare goes.   For my entree, I chose the dirty pasta. The pasta was made/cooked perfectly and the portion was also perfect.The sauce was ground duck, carrot and pecorino romano. In its entirety, the dish was addictive. I could not have asked for a better meal.",

Very trendy, intimate atmosphere upstairs - could do w/o the cold air blasting on my neck.  Smoke and mirrors cocktails - smoky and tasty  Mac and cheese - aaaaaaaauuughhhllll (Homer Simpson drool). A delicious, creamy blend of different cheeses . Soooo good.  Friendly locals and good drinks - I recommend. I also recommend the hosts downstairs to remove the stick from their ...well, you know.",

Fantastic cocktails 2. hand crafted by the amazing bar manager, Kimber, that 3. collectively put me on my arse that night. Man oh man, I can't wait to go back to Pittsburgh to have a full meal at this place. If the food is as good as the drinks I'll be in for a treat! The menu looked amazing too, but we had already eaten and this was our \"night cap\". The restaurant came recommended and I know why. It had a nice intimate vibe upstairs - there were dining tables on one end and a more chill lounge area (with full service) on the other. We sat at the bar in good hands with Kimber. We asked a ton of questions about ingredients and what to try next and she never led us astray. I honestly don't remember much after the fact BUT I think Black Dahlia was the winner! Shocker for me because I (used to) hate rye (but love bourbon) and (knowingly putting) egg whites in drinks seems weird. Wrong. I was wrong. We were all wrong. Divine combination!",

Tickets to the symphony and dinner at Butcher and the Rye before hand. We made reservations for 6 PM and arrived at 5:45. We approached the host and told him we had reservations for a table for 2 and he said oh yeah your right here and pointed to a a table to the left that was for 6 people and 4 people were already sitting there. We said we would like a private table as this is a special event and he offered us to eat at the bar instead. We explained to him again that sucks we would like a private table as this was a special night out for us. He said he would not have a table till much later. HELLO WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING A RESERVATION FOR A TABLE FOR 2. He then proceed to offer no additional assistance and didn't even really look around the restaurant to see if there was the possibility of a table opening up. I am sorry but if I am going to spend $200-300 on a dinner I don't want to sit at picnic table with 4 strangers or i'd go to a tacky hibachi restaurant. We left... and I don't see us ever going back. We love the chef and even went to eat at one of his other restaurants instead actually, but management needs to address this. Fine dining should not be treated this way.",

The ambience once \"in the belly\" of the place makes you feel you're in a cross between an old time restaurant and a place right off the hunting preserve.  All done is a decor that just works very well.    The spirits are plentiful as the bar serves up some fantastic whiskey and bourbon cocktails, along with many of the traditional drinks served at most places.   The food...fabulous!  Our table ate about a half dozen of the small plates and loved every one...pig candy, bone marrow, charcuterie, beef tartare, brussels sprouts...any place that makes brussels sprouts taste incredible is a winner!  And then dinner...from the large plates.  Two hanger steaks, scallops, and rabbit...all incredible, all shared around the table because it was just that good.   It's simple.  Plan ahead.  Make the reservation.  Get to this place for dinner as soon as you can!  This is a top 5 in the Burgh for sure!",

We came here as a belated celebration for our 1st anniversary, and they so nicely (unlike the adjoining restaurant, which I believe may be related/co-owned oddly), recognized it, congratulated us and wen gave us these beautiful vintage glasses with some sparkly to toast to!   We read some reviews in advance so we went for some of the more popular dishes. We had the Brussels, the dirty pasta and the rabbit.  The Brussels are a huge portion so if you have several people, you'll each get at least a serving-it was a lot for the two of us, but we didn't mind bringing it home.  Our first round was really heavy on the salt, so they happily made us a new batch, and the second round was perfect!  The dirty pasta I didn't think I was going to like and honestly was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  Especially since it was savory and didn't have tomato-based sauce! And the rabbit was great-huge leg/portion of meat vs what I was expecting and despite me not liking the battered exterior the meat itself was amazing (as was the truffle polenta).    We didn't do dessert (they have a few options but nothing stood out to us), and we aren't big whiskey drinkers unfortunately, but we did get a Moscow mule, and although it's a simple drink I've had it at probably over 100 places and this was one of my top 5.  Pro tip:  get seated at the top level of you can, and FYI--there's a bar on the 3rd \"floor\" as well!",

We had a reservation and were seated promptly. The hostess even accommodated our picky table preserve (thank you!) Our server was super cute and full of great recommendations. I was boring and only ordered a bottle of wine with dinner... after having the cocktails post dinner I regretted my decision.   For dinner we had the Tartare, Buttermilk Fried Rabbit and Dirty Pasta. I ate Rabbit people!! And it was incredible. Thankfully my boyfriend is adventurous and after letting me order a bottle of wine, took things into his own hands so we could have a real Butcher and the Rye experience.    We agreed the tartare was okay, the Rabbit fantastic... but the Dirty Pasta - OMG. I'd go back again just for the pasta. I've never had anything like it. If you take one recommendation from this review, it's order the Dirty Pasta.   Incredible experience overall. Highly recommend. Make a late reservation to enjoy the atmosphere.   Recommendations:  Cocktail - Adios Interminable  Food - Dirty pasta",

Whiskeys are imported and selected from all over so come with something atypical in mind because they likely can make it. Fried rabbit is crisp on the outside and tender inside. Seasoned well with polenta. Dirty pasta is al dente with great flavor of chopped duck. Top it off with honey cake that has Johnny Walker ice cream.",

The decor in this place is nothing short of interesting - I'm not sure if it's considered shabby chic but it was such an odd mixture of taxidermy, old books, weird wallpaper, and other random items. Seating was pretty tight, and I was sitting right under a large mounted deer.  We both went for drinks, of course. My partner went for some whiskey on the rocks and a couple beers; though I don't remember the particulars, he enjoyed everything he got. I stuck with the Paperweight cocktail which was DELICIOUS enough that I had 3 of them.  For a shared appetizer, we did naan with hummus, which was perfect.  I did a seasonal salad, which was divine. My partner had the Sunday Gravy, which I swiped a few bites of. The lamb was very strongly flavored, but complimented by everything else in the dish.  We each topped it off with a large plate; I had the buttermilk fried rabbit, which was easily one of the tastiest meals I've ever eaten. I'd never had rabbit before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was amazing. My partner had a grilled filet that was overcooked, but wasn't too bad considering. The staff did take care of the overcook steak quickly. Our service overall was fantastic, and other than the overcooked steak, everything we ate and drank made for a great experience.",

Well, first let me say that the impeccable chef DeShantz  has been keeping this epicurean HOT SPOT alive for half decade now and is continuous, progressive and innovative in the creations of not only his menu, but the ever changing seasonal menu. At the bar, the rare and vintage collection of Whiskey, Bourbon, Scotch, and crafted cocktail menu is too continuous.    The scene and the atmosphere is always the Who's who in celebrity sightings to the locals. The upper bar is eclectic and unique to the restaurant itself and has a slight separate feel of swanky speakeasy intimacy to hipster but not annoying clientele.

The cocktail list is long, but I love getting a negroni or old fashion.   For dinner me and my friend split the filet and scallops. The scallops were listed under small plates, but they made it into a dinner portion for us. It was delicious. It was perfectly seared and laid on a bed of crispy kale and the creamiest risotto.   The filet was just as tasty. We asked for it medium rare and it was definitely that, if not on the rarer side. But seriously still delicious and a good cut of meat. The roasted potatoes was a nice addition, but I wish there was an additional complimentary veggie with the dish.   Both dishes were still pretty small. Honestly we could have ordered two more sides and been good to go. I left after another hour and was hungry again! Definitely not a cheap place either, so just keep that in mind. You'll also want to make a reservation, as it's pretty hard to walk-in and get a table since it's small. We were lucky to snag some bar seats, which worked out great!   Good to know their food game is still strong, I'd just order more next time!",

The decorations are unique with top hats as lamps, patterned velvet wallpaper, an antler chandelier, a taxidermy black bear, and little trinkets throughout the restaurant.  My husband and I love whiskey, so of course we had to order some cocktails. I got the \"Wild Kind\"; it was good, but if you don't like ginger, steer clear. My husband got the \"Salinger's Sling\"; it was good, too, with a coffee aftertaste.  For our meals, I ordered the roasted chicken and my husband ordered the burger. Both were excellent! (I, of course, had to try a bite of his). The chicken was white meat stuffed with a dark meat chicken sausage. It was moist and went perfect with the creamy brussels it sat on. The burger was cooked perfectly and the meat was juicy. The fries were thin, crispy and delicious.  Dessert was probably our least favorite part of the meal, but it was still good. We got the honey cake. It was a tad overcooked, but I'm pretty sure they bake them fresh, so that makes up for it.  Overall, we had a great night. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely come back!",

The Brussels are one of the finest small plates I've had anywhere mainly due to the perfect char and use of preserved lemon which sets it apart.  Pig Candy is also a winner.  I love the short ribs as a large plate and don't sleep on the Shepherd's Pie.    It would be great if they made more of the Butcher Burgers though - they are always out of them when I get there, which means they must be epic.   Very dark inside with a cool somewhat kitschy ambiance.  Retro almost steampunk in my eyes, but what do I know!   A great place for drinks - especially for a bourbon guy like me.    The staff is good, not superlative, but their friendliness and enthusiasm for service make up for any errors- which are few.    The only complaints I have seen are about price, portion and staff.  As far as price goes, it is commensurate to the quality of the product; therefore, fair in my estimation.  Join the Elks Club if you want cheep booze.  Eat at Old Country Buffet if you want obscene portions, and as far as staff goes, most complaints I've seen are from people who take issue with the hipster vibe of many on the staff which is not fair.  Beards on the young men and tattoos on the young ladies don't bother me.",

    "text": "Dear Butcher and the Rye,  Your women's bathroom is the most ridiculous bathroom I have ever seen, and offends my female dignity.  For reals.  As you know, this bathroom was obviously designed by a male, Hipster architect (no woman would ever be so bone-headed), and the issue is that the two tiny stall doors and walls are waist-high. The upshot is that every time you walk into the restroom, you get to stare directly into the desperate, trapped eyes of ladies in the two stalls at the very moment that they are relieving their bladders and/or bowels. If you get close enough (which you pretty much have to, because it's a tiny space), you can also see their hiked up skirts and all their ladybits.  Awwwwkward!!    As if all of that weren't excitement enough, the ladies' room is directly adjacent to the men's restroom. Which means you may also get the unique humiliation of having your date or your Dad as he's passing by the door witness your pride washing away with each flush of the toilet bowl.    The conversations I have had in this restroom attest to the intense discomfort: One diner: \"What if I had to change a tampon?  This is awful.\"  Another diner: \"Ladies, can you please turn your backs and also block the door? I'm really uncomfortable right now.\"  I can now confidently say that people don't want to feel like farm animals in pens when they are patrons of one of the best restaurants in town.  This is taking the butcher concept to a not-fun extreme.     There's no point in waxing poetic about how your harissa cauliflower was Foodgasmic, how the Witch Doctor cocktail was perfectly crafted, or how the tables under the antler chandelier are charming.  Why?  Because of your G. D. ladies' bathroom.  I kindly request that you take some of your piles of profit and install regular-height bathroom doors.    The ladies of Pittsburgh and I thank you for your time,  A Diner Who Really, Really Has to Pee",

    "text": "When I think of a restaurant that embodies the culture of Pittsburgh while feeling very city-like, Butcher & the Rye comes to mind. Why? Because their menu hits all the great flavors that make Western Pennsylvania what it is: great cuts of meat and fish, seasonal veggies cooked with plenty of earthy flavors, and a drink selection that screams \"whiskey-lover\". Stop by mid-evening for a quiet after work crowd, or come on in after 9pm for a lively bar scene.  Speaking of the bar... I used to only come to Butcher for the drinks. Their specials hang on a piece of brown butcher paper along the wall and the bar itself is small and intimate. It's most distinguished feature is their full wall of whiskey at this place that they have a neat sliding ladder that the bartenders will climb up to reach bottles up high. The bartenders themselves are extremely knowledgeable. They can make you anything you want! I love their Mint Juleps at Butcher, as well as their Old Fashioned.  Now, let's talk about the food. When I finally did make my way over to the second floor for a meal, my date and I split three dishes. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was cooked to perfection with a beautiful balance of weight, flavor, and texture. My favorite was their sprouts, but the mac and cheese came close behind, as well as their roasted cauliflower. The service was fantastic, and the waiters have these great little leather bound books that they leave the check in. You can flip through this book and see what messages and drawings past guests have left Then, you can leave your mark on Butcher and the Rye as well. The Ambiance in this restaurant is dark, intimate, and rustic. It's something out of the prohibition age, with a rusty-victorian flair. I love all the cool lamps hanging on the walls and the polished wooden tables. If the weather is nice, it's awesome to sit outside and people watch on Sixth Street. Indoors, is a great experience on its own, though!  Butcher and the Rye nailed food in Pittsburgh on the head. It's a classic go-to destination for those visiting and locals alike. Enjoy!  - xoxo, A (A California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)",

My friend ordered it and then we had to go to Chipotle afterward to end our hunger. He got a huge steak bowl with chips and guacamole there. The salads at butcher were loaded with dressing, far too much. Won't ever come back. Better off going to Tako or South Side or Oakland area to eat well.",

    "text": "Ok. I admittedly go the bathroom here a whole lot more often than I actually consume a full meal.   Perhaps I should write my entire entry about timely strategies using the restroom; or scoring the ability to sit with a drink while waiting for your party's reservation at Butcher & The Rye and/or tako on a regular basis. I'm pretty sure that's my real expertise. And that is kind of sad now that I write it. But the food at taco & BATR is amazing most of the time. So I'm willing to continue on in the dysfunctional relationship I tolerate with these establishments. Which is how I end up using the bathroom at BATR more often than I eat there. (When dining at taco, there is one stall for the entire place, INSANE, I head over here to use the ladies room. Same with scoring a seat at the bar before getting a table at tako. We tend to stop here first)   Strange, I have never been to tako or BATR and done the following- have a drink at the bar, consumer my meal, and used the restroom without walking between the two establishments.   I love both restaurants but I also like being able to use a restroom without standing in a line that's creating a human traffic jam. (tako is just poorly designed. it's like a real mexican experience in that you might feel desperate enough to use an alley as a toilet with their restroom line) I also like to sit while waiting. Back and forth. Back and forth.   Despite less than ideal restrooms, & bars that are just slammed beyond capacity; the space is very pleasant in Butcher And The Rye if you're seated at a table. If you arrive and find you are being given some awkward seating situation that really isn't the table type that you reserved, I'd skip the dining experience and return for a different evening. Food is excellent. Service and seating can be weird if its too busy and it seems that overbooking is the norm.   BUT THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT. That keeps us coming back. Just not with kids. I'm sure someone has brought kids. Sometimes it's a bit chaotic in feeling while there. It's almost too annoying at times for me, and I'm an adult. Its come to the point where I avoid making reservations of the weekend. Too many people clamoring for a last minute spot or trying to steal a spot at the bar. Go on a week night so you can enjoy your meal, savor every bite, let each drop of your drink linger. And not feel that buzz of others anxiety to get a spot or use the toilet.  Now the good stuff-  I don't drink whiskey BUT I've dined with others who get almost giddy at the whiskey selections offered. Also, I don't consume pork, red meat, or duck. (Gallbladder issues)  And have an aversion towards mushrooms, scallops, mussels, and rabbit. And an allergy to peaches, strawberries, cherries, and apples. So, one might wonder, What do I eat while everyone else is happily munching away at my table? Tomato Gazpacho, Beet Salad, Brussels, Mac N Cheese, or Cauliflower, Pasta modified, or chicken, - it's easy to not get bored.   My favorite meal by far is the Mac N Cheese, with a beet salad, and cheese board to share. And maybe brussels if I'm feeling generous and am willing to take a doggie bag home. Yes, a bit heavy on so many forms of cheese but it's a dream. Fontana, cheddar, goat, parmesean, oh my!  Oh, and the beet salad! That beet salad has just the perfect amount of crunch due to the greens and croutons layered with a pickled fennel zing and the perfect amount of zest in the orange dressing. The salad also had pepitas and goat cheese mixed in to create an amazing party in your mouth. Sweet, salty, pickled, crunchy. Paired with a glass of wine- heaven. Refreshing. And the brussel sprouts are unnecessary but they taste so good. Who knew sprouts could be delicious?! These are so amazing with their brown butter and cheese that my dogs will even eat them when brought home in their doggie bag! Yes, you read that. Brussel sprouts so amazing my dog will eat them leftover!   Admittedly my mini dachshund mix has a weight issue, she does get a lot of dining out leftovers but no matter what she usually won't touch vegetables. A lot of effort is put into her eating around the vegetable that come home in her doggie bags from other restaurants. The cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and salad bits are even consumed when brought home from Butcher And the Rye. Although my husband and father have proven they really love our smaller yet fattest dog, they order the Marrow just to have the leftovers to take home for her or her fat counterpart who lives with my parents. The dachshund duo practically loose their minds when the Marrow leftovers come home.   So whether you end up having an entire meal at a real table, or stop to use the restroom and go because the place to is too chaotic and overbooked to dine; I hope you too can appreciate the ambiance and cute decor. And when it isn't complete chaos do make a reservation to enjoy a meal.",

From girly drinks to classic man cocktails, they've got you covered, but I think they specialize in the middle ground. Many of the concoctions I've never heard of or tasted anything like them before.  The upstairs cocktail bar has a special additional cocktail menu I was told is not available downstairs. All of the bartenders are extremely friendly and hilarious to have a great chat with. I haven't tried the food but have seen a few of the dishes, with an impressive sounding menu with impressively large portions for the price.  This is my favourite bar in the city for the incredible ambiance, which has got to be the best in the entire city, the cocktails, and the super cheap craft beer selections to end the night with. I've tried their house dark ale on draught, a rye porter, and will definitely be back for another serving soon.",

The special cocktail when I went was called \"the Parisian\" I believe, and it was truly fabulous - hints of smoke, faint sweetness without being overwhelming, egg foam, cinnamon. We also shared a cheese plate with friends, which was superlative, though a bit scant on the cheese for the price. Basically I'd recommend this place for drinks if their cocktails hold up this well in the future (we loved the special so much that two of our party got the same one twice). However, I'm unconvinced of the price-to-deliciousness ratio for the food. I'd certainly return to find out.",

My first impression of the place was not great. Our reservations were pretty late and when we showed up, we had to wait another half hour for our table. Upon arrival at our table, there were multiple empty tables around us so we were confused about our long wait time. The food style is more avant garde than Meat and Potatoes with smaller portion sizes (which is how Butcher and the Rye is advertised). It may be because I am biased toward Meat and Potatoes but I was not impressed by the quality of the food and the value of the dishes. If you haven't experienced Meat and Potatoes, I would go there first before trying out their sister restaurant. If I come here again, I will update my review to see if my opinion was reinforced or changed.",

I can't even describe the flavor of this dish. Probably one of the best meals I have ever had... I wish I could put it into words but I can't you just have to try it. Don't be afraid of the duck, \"gamey\" is not the word I would use to describe this dish. My friend ordered the hanger steak (cooked to perfection) along with the potato soup. The potato soup presentation and flavor is to die for. The waiter brought out the bowl with the herbs and potatoes nicely arranged in the center, followed by a mason jar of the actual soup, then poured it onto the perfectly placed arrangement. The bacon confit combined with the herb flavors is a killer combo. I have stopped in here for some late night drinks as well, Cecil is probably one of the best bar tenders in the area. If you aren't picky tell him to surprise you, he won't disappoint! p.s check out their Instagram as well as meat and potatoes and tako if you need more convincing. This group of restaurants is by far my favorite in the Pittsburgh area.",

Wife's octopus was very good.  We shared the S'mores dessert and it was pretty good. All in all, not terrible, but not great either.

We started off with the brussel sprouts and the fried octopus. Both were very yummy. The portions were totally different. Lots of sprouts vs two small pieces of octopus. For dinner I had the dirty pasta which was one of the best meals I have had out in a while! A big portion with ground duck and the pasta tasted fresh made. My boyfriend got the trout which he really enjoyed. It was served with roasted potatoes and tomatoes. My only complaints were the very crammed seating and a broken door stall in the women's bathroom that was propped up against the wall. Really?",

We started off with the steak tartare, pig candy, Brussels sprouts, and the Shishito peppers. All of the appetizers were great but the steak tartare and Brussels sprouts definitely stood out. They are a must. I had a Caesar salad and the scallops for my entree. Both were very good. The blue crab risotto that came with the scallops was fantastic. Our service was great as well. My only complaint is that we were seating at a table up front which made it hard to hear because the bar was so crowded and loud. I will definitely be making a return visit though.",

    "text": "Butcher and the Rye was probably one of the top 10 meals I've ever had. We ordered the foccacia plate, two small plates (the pig candy and the pei mussels) and two large plates (the braised rabbit pappardelle and the seared scallops). The prices weren't as expensive as we had intended, and the portions were perfect. There were a lot of mussels in the plate, so it could have been considered a large plate i think. Everything was amazing and timed perfectly, as they brought out each plate after another, rather than all at once. The beer choice was awesome (as well as the whiskey choice, though we didn't get any). Our waitress Melissa was awesome. Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is too. We will definitely be back! I wasn't sure what to expect as my boyfriend surprised me by taking me there for our anniversary, but we both left full and very happy. Keep up the good work! I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "If you can get past the contrived, super cliche hipster atmosphere (is it a speakeasy? hunting lodge? farmhouse?...whatever it is, it is almost comical how hipster it is) the food is good and the servers are friendly and attentive. I started with the sprouts, which were excellent. The portion was too big, so by the time I was in the 5th large spoonful, the novelty had worn off.  If the portion was half the size, I would have finished the dish with just enough to keep me interested. In this case, less is more. After an appropriate wait (not too long, not too short) I had the flank steak, which was damn near perfect. The bed of warm potato salad had just enough blue cheese to make you take notice.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere was trying so hard to be authentic that it did a disservice to the experience, and made it feel more like a theme restaurant. If they would can the trendy look and just focus on the food, this place would crush it....",

Last night we had a super meal at Butcher, one that would have impressed me anywhere.   Nice to see such an addition to \"The Burgh\".    The place is visually beautiful.   Service was terrific.   Of course, it all comes down to the food.    Several dishes were spectacular (brussels sprouts (it's True), shishito peppers, crispy pork wings, pig candy, pot de creme dessert).   A few were very good (burrata, pork marrow).   The mussels and focaccia were good (but nothing special).   Only the peach pie dessert was below average - only because the crust tasted like it was deep fried in the same shortening (oil) vat with a variety of other foods.   You should definitely put this on your culinary \"to do\" list.   We'll be back soon.",

They tried to seat us upstairs in a dark corner sitting on a little cube with a 2 ft diameter circular round table. I told the server this wouldn't work for me and the manager reseated us at a normal cocktail table. Notice I have given 4 stars, the problem was handled appropriately. We ordered martinis immediately, one of the worst martinis I have had in Pittsburgh, again, notice I gave 4 stars, I get it, this is a bourbon/whiskey bar. I had a couple makers 46 old fashioneds after that that were very good. Food is great, tartare was excellent, best I can recall having in Pittsburgh. Macaroni a cheese was one of the best things we ordered, give it a try. Almost didn't order the bread, that would have been a mistake, it was excellent. Overall this place is a cool atmosphere, not family oriented, which is a big plus for me. Downside is that some tables are so dark that you can't see what you're doing. I would not hesitate to go again, and I will try and hit it again in the next couple months, but this place isn't the end all be all of Pittsburgh.",

The drinks were 100% and the found was 100% as well.   The bartender was the only downside. He quite absent mindedly seemed to mix our drinks and handed them to us without even making eye contact while continuing a loud and obnoxious competitive \"conversation\" with another patron.   But because the drinks and food were so good I will still give a 5.   The small bites were fried octopus, duck liver pate, fried cauliflower and a pig wing (mini pig shank).   Each item was 100%. I really was surprised. It's not often you hit 4/4 on a menu like that.   I could eat those pig wings all day!!",

    "text": "Wanted to try somewhere a little more upscale downtown and decided on Butcher and the Rye based on reviews. Glad we did!   Reservations are encouraged, especially for the weekend. We made ours two days ahead of time via Yelp and got great seats on the 3rd floor, where it was more quiet. If you have a specific time you wanna come, I suggest making the reservation further in advance. The earliest option for us was a 9pm reservation, so that's what we did.  Ambiance - It's pretty dark inside, but it was definitely more casual than I thought it would be. The interior reminded me of the inside of a Victorian home with their wallpaper, wooden staircases, and taxidermied animals. It stays True to the Americana theme they are going for.  Service - Hosts, waiters, staff were all great and super helpful. Service was attentive, but not intrusive.  Food - Came here with bf and we split everything. Pig Candy: Pork belly served with apple kimchi. This was my least favorite dish, but it wasn't bad, it was just very average. I appreciate the thought behind this, where they took a very Asian inspired dish and made it their own by swapping out Asian ingredients for American ones i.e. switching out napa kimchi for apple kimchi, daikon radish for red radish. I felt like the pork belly could've been more melt in your mouth.   Charcuterie Board: I was surprised at all the stuff you got for $20! There's even foie gras! The foie here was a little gamier than the ones I like, but spread over toast, it was still pretty good. The spread included multiple kinds of pork, duck, pickled fennel, peppers, cauliflower, whole grain mustard and pork fat butter. Aside from the meat, the cauliflower and mustard really stood out. We didn't really like the pork fat butter. It was cool how they made something so heavy tasting super light and airy, but it still felt like you were eating fat.  Steak Tartare: This was my favorite dish. I love anything tartare. It was light, sweet, and flavorful. I really liked the perfect consistency of the egg yolk that came with it, but wish there was maybe a second yolk since it was such a big serving. I was scraping up any bits that we dropped and we ate every last bite. I would still have to say that I prefer horse taretare over steak tartare, but I'm not sure you can find horse tartare in the US (had it in Europe & Asia). But steak is still yummy.  Dirty Pasta (w/ Ground Duck) - Such a HUGE portion for $20. The pasta noodles were excellent!! I loved the texture and chew. Overall the dish was good, but also really heavy since duck is surprisingly fatty and all the cheese and stuff. If you're also getting small plates, I highly recommend splitting this. Would absolutely not have been able to finish this on my own.  Drinks- Didn't try any of their whiskey, but they have a great beer selection as well. Well priced.  Price - I'm from D.C. and I'm used to paying big city prices. I love coming out to Pittsburgh to visit the BF because we get to indulge in decadent meals and not bleed our wallets. After drinks, food, tax, tip, our total was something like just under $120.   Definitely recommend!",

I tried the pappardelle, and it was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. It was definitely homemade and fresh.  I also really enjoyed the ambiance here. The atmosphere is both rustic and contemporary, with a dimly lit dining room. The dining room and bar area are both warm and inviting.   The only downside (and should not be a consideration when considering this restaurant ) is that this place gets very busy. If you go on the weekend, there is almost certainly going to be a wait. The bar seats are also difficult to score; however, there's a second bar upstairs, which usually has some open seats.   The price is fair and commensurate with the quality of the dishes and the experience. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Wow, great meal on all fronts at this casual and funky restaurant.  We were visiting Pittsburgh and read about this restaurant.  We tried for a reservation but couldn't get in and were headed somewhere else.  But we walked by that afternoon and inquired inside and were able to get seated in the bar area -- and glad we did.  The restaurant itself is charming and very \"Fixer Upper\", four floors that are all different and lots of nooks and crannies.  The whiskey selection is impressive (and tall).  Husband did a flight and I had a New York sour that was so good I may have ordered a second one (who can remember?).  We started with the Sunday gravy.  You should order this, but be forewarned it's hard to stop eating and you might fill up on it.  Our server told us that dish and the Pork and Lobster Sugo (which we also ordered and was also delicious) are one of the chef's grandmother's recipes.  You can't go wrong with that.  Other standouts: the housemade charcuterie plate and Filet mignon.  Service was wonderful. Attentive and friendly. We asked for guidance on the menu and he described the ingredients in detail with deep expertise. Looking forward to a return trip to this restaurant or maybe Meat and Potatoes. I'm a fan.",

The bar is rather small with stools being a premium. The back bar is shelves with fine whiskey's and bourbon. In fact, they have wooden ladders on rails, like the ones you would see in an old library, to reach the upper shelves. I ask the bartender, Allyson for a \"smokey\" and she suggested their \"Blood & Sand\". It was outstanding. I want to come back for a meal.",

    "text": "Came here with colleagues for drinks and apps. First and foremost, the interior is perfect. Reminds me of old school western tavern movie sets we used during film school. Very intimate but also caters to festive groupings. This group does ambience just right (enter , Tako and M&P).  If ever I want old school Pittsburgh blended with a touch of modern flare, Butcher and M&P will always be my first choices.   Let's start with the Nauti-Mule. As I read the description not only was I intrigued but I also started asking people for Prilosec as the jalapeno was a bit of a curve ball for me - I was dead wrong. This was a delicious drink and kudos to those who tend bar at Butcher.  Being a Bond fan one can never overlook a drink appropriately named Vesper and being an avoid taster and lover of apple brandy, the Jack Rose was spot on.  Let's talk grub. We kept it to appetizers which was great as we had dinner plans later that evening. If anyone reading this has ever been to Nashville or Charleston, legendary Chef Sean Brock has an incredible restaurant in both locations called Husk. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the US. He, too, at one point had a dish similar to the Candied Pig and Cauliflower. I'm going to give it to Butcher when I say both were on par with what I had at Husk! Albeit bacon, I'm not even a pork fan (sue me).  Anyhow, these were my orders followed by the Mac N Cheese (really hard to F this up but they did do it great justice with the taleggio adding a bit of a fruity tang to it which I LOVE.   Overall, great atmosphere, great flavors, and a subtly festive environment nestled within a romantically rustic ambience.   You can't go wrong.  Highly recommended. Lives up to the hype.",

It's 2 floors are tastefully decorated and there are small separate dining rooms that add a nice touch of intimacy to your dining experience.  I have been here on 2 separate occasions.  The drink menu is a old Rolodex type of phone book which is cute, but can be tough if it's broken as mine was.    I LOVE BRUSSEL SPROUTS, and if you feel the same these are the BEST I have ever had.  I have eating all over american Chicago, LA, NOLA, Portland, Seattle, NYC, Philly, Miami, and if they are on a menu I order them.  This place hands down are the best ever.  They are served roasted topped with Parm and a delicious dipping sauce.    I have eaten the following items here over my 2 visits:  1. Skirt Steak - delicious, my least fav, but not awful at all 2. Cheese plate - great cheese and accompaniments 3.Leek soup - Just awesome, the pork belly takes it to the next level 4. Scallops with blue crab risotto - one of the best entrees I have eaten in a long time.  The portion, favor combo, presentation are perfection 5. Brussel Sprouts - See above, AMAZING!  The drinks are also delicious!  I have had the old fashioned each time I have been.  They also have my favorite champagne by the glass available, Veuve Clicquot Rose!!!  Make sure you make a reservation at least a week of 2 in advance, it fills up fast here.",

We were worried that we were going to lose our table, but the staff didn't seem to mind. It might have been because they don't open until 5, so it wasn't busy yet. The service was very slow, and the tables were too close, but we didn't even care because the food and drinks were so good! We also had plenty to look at throughout the restaurant, and the staff was extremely pleasant! We weren't sure what to order, so we just got the special (shown in picture). I couldn't believe soup could taste that good! I could have eaten only the soup as my meal and would have been happy. The entree was really good too, but the desert was bland. We don't usually order dessert, and were pretty full by the time it came out anyway, though.",

    "text": "A group of four of us enjoyed a pretty tasty early dinner this past November. This place is popular, so we had to make the reservation on the early side. It was for sure full when we got there.   It was a weird but interesting place for a date night, what with the velvet walls and taxidermy theme stuff. The playlist was funky and enjoyable, if a little loud. We had a good time.   To start, we had the cheese board ($16), rusted duck brodo ($10) and the cauliflower with roasted farro, romanesco, baby carrots, pine nuts, brown butter, and harissa yogurt ($10). The brodo was a bit over salted for my tastes, though my husband was happy with it. I was a really big fan of the cauliflower--the farro gave it a really nice earthiness and the harissa yogurt a nice kick.   The men at the table also shared the pig candy ($8, pork belly, apple kimchi, miso caramel, and cilantro), which they were for sure into.   For our entrees, two of us got the scallops over risotto, a different iteration than they have now, but similar, with a chard over it instead of being paired with asparagus. The scallops were cooked extremely well and melted in my mouth in just the right way. My husband had the pan seared halibut with greens, almonds, and a green drizzle ($29) and cleaned his plate, though agreeing that it, too, was a bit on the salty side. Our friend's husband got the roasted chicken ($26) and gave it his hearty approval.   Cocktail-wise, everyone was very happy. All were tasty and well-balanced. I had the \"ether\"  (gin + cucumber + something else), and my boo had something equally tasty with an egg white on top.  At dessert time, we got a pumpkin pie that was not really what we expected -- more like a mini pot pie than a slice of pie. It was't so great, but maybe mostly just because it didn't live up to expectations. I was in no way into the crust.   Overall, it was a nice place to share a meal with friends, but it definitely didn't blow my mind.",

Big chunks of lobster and homemade noodles in a delicious sauce. It was heaven. All of my coworkers really like their dishes.

The restaurant seated us immediately upon checking in for our reservation and we received top notch service in spite of many holiday parties and overall full house of diners that evening. The restaurant itself was decorated whimsically and approiately for the seaon and I loved the various levels of dining and bar areas.  Our drink varied, but the Bowtie was a favorite. The appetizers were all tasty. My personal favorite was the brussel sprouts, contrary to my hubby and son's review of sprouts in general...haha. They enjoyed the pig wing and potato and leek soup which were both quite good too.  For our entrees, we were all pleased with our selections. They were as ordered: SEARED SCALLOPS $26  blue crab risotto / asparagus / chanterelles / capers Amazing!!! Cooked to perfection! Best Risotto I have had in a while!  CASSOULET $30 duck confit / boudin noir / pork belly / 5 minute egg / cannellini beans / brown butter crumbs / pickled orange / mustard Cooked well with a variety of flavors in this dish. Duck was not greasy, but flavorful and boudin was delish!  DIRTY PASTA $18 ground duck / strozzapretti / sage / brandy / pecorino romano Wonderful pasta dish! Ground duck and seasonings made this a must order for pasta lovers.  The restaurant could not have been more convenient to Heinz Hall located directly across the street. We will absolutely dine here again in the future and recommend it to our friends for sure. FINALLY a restaurant downtown I can put on my \"go to\" list!",

    "text": "In the movie version of \"American Psycho,\" the title character was shown dining at some of the more ludicrous yuppie high-concept restaurants of late-1980s New York.    Is the Butcher and the Rye a Patrick Bateman restaurant for the 2010s?  It is about as production-designed as any restaurant you'll see, a two-story approximation of some Wild West saloon of the near apocalyptic future.  There's a giant wall of brown liquor--probably three hundreds bottles' worth--that stretches so high that ladders are required to reach many of them.  That wall is mightily impressive from both a visual and connoisseur's viewpoint.  And the dim, low-ceilinged barroom upstairs where we were seated definitely achieves some of the rough-hewn Western atmosphere the owners were shooting for.  The Butcher and the Rye comes from a pretty common template these days:  A temple of over-the-top carnivorousness, it's devoted to many varieties of animal flesh prepared in a variety of ways, accompanied by a conspicuous focus on brown liquor and craft cocktails.  When we male metrosexual dweebuses are reduced by 21st century society to walking around while tapping on our little mini-keyboards, a place like the Butcher and the Rye apparently is supposed to allow us to reassert our Manly Virtues.  Or something.    Anyway, I like to eat meat (within reason), and the Butcher and the Rye seemed like a great place to do it.  (Sure, there are non-meat items on the menu, but you come to a place like this to eat meat.)  Upon reading the menu, it seemed like an ideal one for shared-plates dining, but (as suggested further below) our server was of little help in steering us toward a coherent line-up of food.  We tried to put one together anyway, with mixed results.  The charcuterie board was a good start--a generous variety of both cured meats and pickled veggies, plus plenty of crostini.  Some of the meats stood out more than others.  \"Pig candy\" was pork belly with house kimchi and offered a well-balanced if somewhat generic Korean flavor profile; it was good, but not amazingly so.  For a meat-centric place, the cauliflower, which came with roasted faro and romanesco, was excellent, and came in a healthy portion.  We were the most excited about the \"Sunday Gravy\"--which came with lamb neck, tomatoes, olive oil, and ricotta, plus more crostini--but while it had deep flavor, texturally it was a bit of a mushy mess.    All in all, the food was good, but not quite at the level suggested by the reviews.  I should note that a night earlier we were at the superb Morcilla, which although in roughly the same price range was easily a notch or two better, food-wise.  Yes, I recognize that I am comparing apples and oranges, food-wise; they're very different restaurants.  But maybe that negatively shaded my impression here.  Biggest problem on this evening, though, was our cold-fish main server.  She had the full-sleeve tattoo that is de rigueur for her line of work in 2016--I cast zero judgment on that--but otherwise had the appearance, attitude, and demeanor of a snooty sorority vice-president or junior account executive.  From the standpoint of taking our orders and getting them brought to the table, she did a reasonably effective job (and the guy who brought our big charcuterie plate patiently explained everything on it).  But from the standpoint of informatively answering just two or three very simple questions about the menu or the very basic courtesy of making us feel welcome, she certainly did not.  (As in all such judgments, I recognize that people have bad days, and maybe she was having one.)  Call it a hair short of three-and-a-half.",

Meal:  Everything was dreamy and my colleagues couldn't stop mentioning the chicken dish all week. I had the pate de foie gras and the Sunday gravy. The pate was creamy, not metallic at all, and the toppings really gave it a fresh new twist. After I finished the bread, I had it by the spoonful. It was THAT good. The Sunday gravy brought back memories of granny's stew. Tender, slowly brazed, and so comforting. The tomato base worked so well with the goat meat, which was tender and packed with flavor. I might have forgotten to breathe between forkfuls here and there.  I also tasted the Brussels sprouts and the polenta. Both of them pretty amazing.   Service/ambiance: considering the bartender was our server and we had 10 people, he did great! I would recommend this eclectic place for both a date and a group outing. I loved the quirky decor and the dimmed lights. The music was also on point!",

    "text": "TLDR: Good: Dirty pasta, service, kitchen coordination, overall quality  Bad: Food too extreme/salty, too loud  --  The overall quality of the dining experience here is what raises Butcher and the Rye to 4 stars for me. It's luxe and the owner has gone lengths to make sure the details are just so, in order for the customers to feel like they're being taken care of.   We came to Butcher and the Rye on a Wednesday night and were taken care of by Eric, who did an excellent job. We were sat by the bar, which was initially fine. Then a loud group of people came in, and took up residence about five feet away from us. When we requested to move tables, Eric was quick to accommodate us and we moved to a quieter area. Throughout the night, the kitchen and waitstaff were well-coordinated and knew our new location consistently and without problems. We were given several recommendations and were informed of which items were most popular on the menu. We ended up getting all of Eric's favorites.  We got the brussels sprouts, the beef tartare, the scallops, and the dirty pasta. For dessert, we got a chocolate mousse. In my opinion, the food was a mixed bag.  Brussels sprouts -- apparently, they were the most popular item on the menu. I saw why, but they were too charred and extreme in flavor for me. It's a flavor that I know others enjoy, but it was too much for me.   Tartare -- excellent. Complex in flavor, but the great thing is that you could taste all the individual parts.   Scallops -- best dish we ordered. The scallops were light and buttery, but substantial.   Dirty pasta -- My girlfriend thought it was too salty. I could see that, but I also think that it was really satisfying.   Chocolate mousse -- the portion is pretty large! We couldn't finish it. Decent and satisfying, but I don't think it was worth the price point.   Overall -- we felt taken care of and felt like we were given the best of what they had. We could tell that they used high-quality ingredients, and that they took themselves seriously. The memory of my time here is tainted by some of the flavors being too much for my taste, and the atmosphere being too loud, but I overall have positive things to say about Butcher and Rye.",

Everything around our hotel was almost empty (even on a Saturday night) except this place - which was packed - so figured it must be good. Couldn't get a normal table, but there was room in the bar upstairs.   Chance, our bartender/server, was really friendly, attentive, and made amazing drinks. Our food was excellent - especially the foie gras. The Caesar salad would've been perfect with less radicchio, but no complaints. Will definitely visit if we ever find ourselves in Pittsburgh again!",

We had a large party of 12 and were seated upstairs near the bar on several cushy seats and couches which would have been nicer if we weren't so split up and the seats weren't so low to the ground.  The taller folks in our party - which was everyone except me (LOL) - struggled to get in and out ... but, the food sort of makes up for all of that so let's move on to the menu.    We had some swanky perfectly made cocktails to start.  I loooooooove their Old Fashioned's ... some of the absolute best in the city.  I get mine with Maker's Mark and they are always DIVINE.  We tried the Sunday Gravy made with lamb and nearly licked the bowl.  I mean, we were so close to doing that ... it was THAT delicious.    I had the dry aged steak and it was sublime.  Absolutely perfectly cooked and so tender.  It's pricey at $42 but very good.  Wife had the branzino with garlic scapes and that was amazingly good too.  Of course we had dessert and it was delectable with fruit and cream and shortbread.  Man, was it good.  This area of downtown is vibrant and exciting, right in the heart of the cultural district so it's a good option for out of towners and locals alike.",

The downstairs bar is square shaped - and just the right size.  There are a few communal tables for dining downstairs but upstairs is where most of the dining area consists.  There is another bar upstairs.   I just love the decor of whole restaurant.  The cool-classic wallpaper on the walls and all the cool accents all over.. I enjoyed looking around very much.  It's a fun place to patronize.     We sat at the downstairs bar and shared a cheese plate.  I look forward to going back and trying a whiskey flight.  It was a pleasant first visit.. and looking forward to the next. Thanks Butcher and the Rye.",

Here are some pros and cons.   Pros: + Great ambience + Excellent wine and whiskey options + Great staff + The bar stays open late night   Cons: - Not an extensive menu - You'd expect more \"meat items\" on their menu considering they call themselves \"Butcher and Rye\" - The tables are rather small so if you order several small plates, it's going to be tight  - Less than exciting dessert menu  We ordered several things from the small plates list. We enjoyed everything barring the gnudi. Lack flavor and texture.",

Before arriving in Pittsburgh, I had done some research about the food scene here. This place popped up more than once, so I decided to give it a try, and it did not disappoint!  I began with a grapefruit flavored cocktail to start, which was very good. Not to sweet or sour, and very refreshing. I also had the dirty pasta, which was fresh and very tasty. My colleagues also enjoyed their cocktail special and respective dishes. We all shared a chocolate mousse dessert, which was a great end to our meal.  The ambiance was very nice, somewhere between casual and upscale. Modern and cozy environment. The service was also very good. They were able to accommodate our table despite us coming on a busy Friday night. I can confidently recommend this place.",

We ordered a lot thinking that small plates would actually be small but they were surprisingly big.  The brussel sprouts are fantastic.  I could have eaten them all as my entree. The cheese plate was nice - very delish honey and rhubarb complimented the cheese. Had to get the dirty pasta - second favorite.  Split a burger - also amazing and very different.  Got mac & cheese side - probably could have skipped it.  Standard stuff plus we were filling up.  But not too full for dessert!!! We split two - the lemon cheesecake and pineapple upside down cake.  Both good but the cheesecake was better.  Would have gotten 5 stars except for two things - too freaking dark - could barely read the menu or see the beautiful food.  Second - the tables are too close together.  I sat on the bench side in the upstairs and I'm not heavy but I had to be super careful getting out that I didn't knock anything off the table next to us.  Plus we could hear each others conversations so well it was like we were sitting with them.  I understand maximizing space but a slightly large person would feel like a bull in a china closet!!!!",

It's clear that the space itself is beautifully eccentric, but the food... five stars!!   Our service was great, couldn't have been happier with how quickly we were seated and how attentive our server was.  The food came out surprisingly quick, and was delicious! The fried brussels were top notch, along with the blue crab risotto and roasted duck. Part of me thought that I needed to order more food, but I'm glad I didn't.. the portions were a great size, and I left with a full belly!  Also, just a side note - they do accept reservations, and they are attached to TAKO which is pretty cool.  Bravo, Butcher & the Rye! I will be happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "Needed to see what the hype was about... I understand now. My boyfriend and I had reservations for last night (Saturday) at 7:30. We arrived just around seven and were seated promptly. Kevin, our server was delightful. He was everything that a server should be: prompt, concise, knowledgeable and genuine. He was definitely prepared and his enthusiasm showed. They don't \"do specials\"- the menu is what it is (not in a bad way) the menu was very appealing and interesting. The dishes are meant to be shared almost like family style. We started with the mac and cheese *side* and the Sunday Gravy *small plate* WOAH. The sauce was served with this sheep ricotta over top and it was the perfect balance of flavor. The mac and cheese- rich and creamy (not too thick) but so rich it left a lingering taste in your mouth. I'm still thinking about it.  We split our main course because Kevin did mention the dishes are enough to share. So glad we didn't each order our own only because the starters were super filling. The Scallop *Large Plate* I 10/10 recommend this dish. The scallops (3) were prepared excellent, presentation was beautiful, the blue crab risotto was fluffy and rich. The capers, mushrooms and asparagus were just enough. But wait- the crispy kale on top... I don't even like kale. This kale was AMAZING. I wanted more, I would have ordered it as a side if they had it on the menu. I ordered the punch of the day ($9) worth it. Vodka/gin, Violette, soda and lemon juice I believe. We skipped dessert because we were so full. I saw chocolate mousse go out to a few tables and it looked to die for.  This place is beautiful inside... having multiple floors made for such a romantic ambiance. There are bars on each floor-pretty cool. Loved everything about the place!!",

I didn't find anything on the drink menu particularly enticing so I asked for a vodka martini that was spicy and my waiter and bartender did some magic and came back with a killer drink.  We ordered the Brussels and Sunday gravy. Those Brussels though.... 10/10. The Sunday gravy was also quite tasty (9/10) but the Brussels were some of the best I've ever had (and I order these everywhere). Would have loved to eaten a full dinner here and try more food because everything we had was outstanding!",

    "text": "If you're figuring out what to do while visiting Pittsburgh or if you're a local looking for a new spot. There's no need to read this review, seriously go and make a reservation right now. Use Yelp and reserve a table for your group. You'll freaking adore it and say I love you to the food and drinks more often that one should  For those who need some context why read below!  Butcher and the Rye is a very sexy spot. It's hip, the staff is dressed up all cool, music is set to the right tone, and the decor in here screams hipster chic. I heard about this spot as a must try from Rachel (Yelp Pittsburgh CM) and knew I was going to be well taken care of.  Since I was riding solo like a red cup in college, I took advantage of the second bar upstairs and found a seat quickly. TBH I was the only person sitting at the bar but that was fine by me. I was able to eat like a mad man and not worry about elbow room.  There's plenty of various sitting in this restaurant. I saw a private room on the first floor, bar seating, a mid-level with a few tables, and a private area for celebrations adjacent to the second floor bar.  For my fellow Rye and Whiskey addicts. You'll be in love with the portfolio they feature. I was like a little kid whose head was spinning from countless options. They hand save their ice with an old school machine that is hand drawn. It felt pretty steam punk to me and it made me appreciate my Mint Julep even more.  I wasn't quite hungry but knew I wanted to munch on something. After taking a look at their concise menu, I knew the Dirty Pasta was for me. I don't know why it's called the dirty pasta, because I just about licked my plate clean.  Dirty pasta is a must try with the ground duck and buttery, cheese goodness you get in every bite. I regret not ordering a second plate and fulfilling my inner foodie within.  GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.",

Although it is right next to Tako, the interior is totally different, giving it a different vibe.  Food 4/5 - portion size is very reasonable with the price. I normally don't eat salty food, so the food here is a bit too salty for me. Both dirty pasta and mac and cheese are too salty for me. My other party likes the dirty pasta, it is not too salty for him. The scallops is amazing. The saltiness from scallops is blended very well with the pasta.

What I do remember: we chose to get smaller plates as opposed to separate meals. I know we got gnudi which was pilowy and delicious like you would expect...but the stand out had to be the dirty pasta. So simple but so close to perfect. I took one bite and I was in heaven. Meaty, creamy, ....maybe a little bit too salty?...pasta - what's not to love? I can't wait to make it myself (the recipe is posted somewhere online).

    "text": "I have two words for everyone tonight \"Dirty Pasta\"! Put simply I think it is genius to use ground duck in a pasta dish.  When paired with sage, brandy and pecorino Romano cheese it was everything that I wanted in a meal.  This pasta dish was simply dressed but still it was rich, savory and well herbed with a perfectly al dente rigatoni that seemed to be fresh made and at minimum very high quality.  If I had one note it would be don't be shy with the duck :-) I also had the truffled polenta which was equally delicious so velvety and hugely flavorful. It had enough cream and butter to give you a heart attack but you will surely die happy! Not to worry,  you will be revived by the essence of black truffle that somehow mellows the richness and layers the flavors, Mario eat your heart out.   My friends ordered equally tasty dishes all cooked to perfection- buttermilk fried rabbit with fava bean romanesco  and Scallops with blue crab risotto both accompanied by asparagus and local mushrooms were given equally high marks as was the Burger with oxtale jam, Seven sisters cheddar, radicchio and duck fat aioli. The atmosphere was simple and rustic but also had an upscale feel. The bar featured an amazing variety of whiskey both local and global and has been a multi time semi finalist for the James Beard award in the outstanding bar program category.  If you were looking for something a little different I suggest you give the butcher a shot!",

For $35 you had NO choices...none. What was on the menu is what you got. That was really disappointing right off the bat. Had I known that I would have 100% gone elsewhere to eat.    After starting off really bad and burning my finger on the one 1800s candle they have at the table, I decided to order. Luckily I could even see the menu it was so dark in there!  Ordered beet salad, mac and cheese, and steak.   Wow. The food was great. This place really redeemed itself after the disappointing first impression.   Beet salad was amazing. Loved that it actually had lettuce with it. Steak was great. Mac and cheese is a must order!   Our total bill plus 2 beers and dessert was $80. We shared a full meal, so that was just a one person meal.  Pretty pricy, and was a one time experience.   Loved the food, atmosphere to dark, but wouldn't go back again.",

As it's dining devotees continued to multiply, I decided it was time to investigate for myself.  The rumors are True.  When you sip your expertly prepared craft cocktail or lift your fork to your dish, a beam of light shines down from above, a choir of angels serenade you, and your tongue breakdances in your mouth.  As truly exceptional as the food and drinks are (The bruschetta was phenomenal, and I would sell my soul to learn their Brussel Sprout appetizer recipe) the atmosphere is what is most distinctive about B&R.    I love their sister restaurant Meat & Potatoes, which is also excellent, but the decorations and vibe are on a whole other level.  Imagine if Clint Eastwood was playing a lawyer cowboy industrialist tycoon in the late 1800s, and you'd been invited to a VIP party in his mansion.  Vintage wallpaper, playful taxidermy, books, plush vintage couches, top hats, distressed wood, and antique lighting, are expertly placed to cover every square inch of B&R with class and character.    It's not a cheap, but the food, atmospehere, and fast, friendly, knowledgable staff live up to their sky high reputation.  Butcher and the Rye may be the coolest and most unique gastropub in the burgh.  I can't wait to introduce more friends to it, if only so I have an excuse to go back!",

We had the Brussels, cauliflower, pig candy and artisan bread to start followed by the strip steak and halibut. Then the pumpkin pie and almond cake. All were STELLAR. The Argentinian cab paired deliciously as well. The reason I'm not giving it five stars is due to service and comfort. They have these old, wooden, mis-matched chairs. I know it's supposed to be a Hipster, artsy type of vibe but it's not cool to be uncomfortable at a high-end establishment. The service there is decent but not great. I'm used to that with the indifferent, Hipster Millennials we have in Portland. But it would have been nice if they were a better-trained and more polished.   Overall however it was a very nice experience.",

It was an exceptional experience!  We were a group of 4 just hanging out in the city, we decided to order most of the small plates and share.....it was fantastic!  Each plate came out just as we finished the last one...PERFECT!!  Everything we ate was wonderful!  So much pride in preparing each dish!  We LOVED it!!!  The Brussels sprouts were the table favorite!!  They were INCREDIBLE!!!!!!  Since we sat outside, I couldn't really tell you about the decor..We did dodge the crowd to make it to the bathrooms....and what an eye opener that was!!  It ridiculous!!  Obviously designed by a man.....You definitely have to check it out for yourself!   But, it will make you giggle and makes for colorful dinner conversation...whatever, I'm there for the food..which was AMAZING!!!!",

I've had some new American dining experiences in L.A. and Chicago that were amazing and I was hoping that Pittsburgh would prove that it could stand up with the big boys. We started with the sourdough and it wasn't sour nor was the crust crunchy enough for my preference. Next was the charcuterie board. I was quite pleased with the assortment of meats and pickled vegetables. I think there were 6 different types so it was quite enough for two. Nothing groundbreaking but I was satisfied nonetheless.  What I was most disappointed with was the mussels. At first taste, it had a bit if a pungent smell and I wasn't sure if it was a fishy smell or because of the seasoning. I just wasn't into the weird spices sprinkled on the mussels and I didn't care for the broth flavoring and the chickpeas. It was an interesting combination of flavors but it just wasn't for me.  The service was good and no complaints about that. Drinks were good too. I was just hoping the food would have been a little more memorable.",

My signifiant other ordered the hanger steak which he did not enjoy. I can attest to the hanger steak as we switched plates so he could enjoy the dirty pasta.   The overall experience was great! The service and food was excellent & very prompt. We made it out of dinner in a little over an hour, just in time for the rest of our evening plans.

Plus they don't even have fans to make the guests more comfortable. As for the food, the duck liver pate is delicious. The seasonal salad with tomatoes and watermelon was very nice. The brussel sprouts are way too salty and lemony, as well as over cooked. The pork and lobster pasta was very good. The hanger steak was over salted. The cocktails were yummy!

They were large and cooked perfectly. My friends ordered the roasted chicken and the burger. Both were very happy with their dishes. I had the pappardelle. Great flavor but super salty - so much that it started taking away from the great flavor midway through the meal. Would definitely go again but will avoid the pappardelle next time.",

    "text": "Finally tried this place out after several failed attempt to book dinner at a reasonable time (I live in NY so I consider 9pm reasonable still and had difficulties trying to book on the day and finally the cold weather worked in my favor).  Based on the raves and pricing I would say it delivered as expected, and perhaps I new to come back and try more dishes before I update my rating.  It actually is somewhere around 3.5 stars.  Nice decor definitely had an identity to it.  I tried the skirt steak with fried egg, long beans, rice cake in chilli sauce.  Those of us familiar with Bibimbop will understand me if I say the favoring is very similar.  Instead of rice you get fried Korean rice cakes.  The rice cake retained the chewy characteristics expected except the outside was now a little hard and while I generally like fried stuff I expected it to be a bit more crunchy and perhaps this is a preference but I would almost say if it cannot be crunchy, then better leave it be (chewy).  The one I had was half way in between so it didn't really do it for me.  Skirt steak was very nicely done, I did find the dish in general was slightly sweet to taste, with the streak marinate and sauce.  I had the beer battered peanut butter chocolate brownie with bittersweet chocolate sorbet and peanut praline.  Moist brownie - checked.  Crispy wafer - checked.  Candied peanut praline - crunchy goodness big check.  What I actually liked a lot was the bittersweet chocolate sorbet.  So dessert alone I am happy to give it 4 stars and it is big enough to share between 2.  It is very delicious but quite heavy.",

It was my graduation though, and I really wanted to go because I thought the bar with a wall of whisky and scotch was really cool. Personally, I had a great time watching the bartenders climb the wall. Anyway, the Maid's Wonder is my favorite mixed dream I've ever had somehow. It does not have a strong whisky/scotch flavor, but it is there and I actually loved the flavor in the drink. I also love lemon mixed drinks and cucumber, so this drink was perfect. Everyone else loved the drink after we each tried the first one, and they all ended up ordering one too.  On to the food, the Pig Candy was sweet and bacon-y, and I loved it. I got the special, which was a truffle pasta. It had a little too much truffle flavor after eating enough of it, but I still enjoyed it. One of the others ordered a burger, which I found weird with Burgatory and Stack'd around, and our plans to go to one the next day, and they later said the one at Stack'd was much better. They found the one here a little dry. Another said their brussels sprouts were kind of burnt.  I want to go back. They own a Tequila Bar which is attached to Butcher and the Rye, so you can order your drink at one then just walk through the hall to the other.",

Being that it was V-day weekend, we were lucky to grab a spot along the wall at a countertop. All I can say is....WOW! I ordered the Pig Candy, which lasted about one minute on my plate. That piggy had no chance! We split an order of the Mac n' Cheese, which was also delicious. He ordered their soup special as well, which he said was just as yummy.   We decided to treat ourselves and order some dessert. We opted for the Salted Caramel Apple. When our waitress came back to check on us a minute after getting the dessert, she began to ask \"How is it?\" and immediately knew our answer... the empty plate said it all! The couple next to us laughed because apparently the same thing happened with them, only they had ordered the S'mores.   Next time we're in Pittsburgh, we'll definitely be making reservations to enjoy a full dining experience and a tasting of their drinks!",

So I asked if we could check out the bar and the host then said they might have space at the upstairs bar.  I was so glad he did.  We had fabulous bartenders!

On this visit, I was traveling alone, so I bellied up to the bar. Service was a bit slow and scattered, which was really the only downside of my visit. I tried the dry aged beef tartare and the Brussels sprouts. The tartare was beautifully presented, but a bit underseasoned, and lacking the funk that typically comes from dry aging. The sprouts were crispy and seasoned to my liking with dill, parmesan, and lemon aioli, but I can see where they wouldn't be to everyone's taste. I'll be back to sample more of the menu.",

While the table was huge for 6 (we had TONS of room) the restaurant wasn't too noisy that we couldn't all talk with each other. We all ordered cocktails (with one wine order) and everyone was thrilled with their choices. The Nauti-Mule was deliciously refreshing with a surprising bite to it...definitely don't drink it out of the straw or you'll get all jalapeno!  The meals themselves were out of this world. On the table were the Cassoulet, the specialty Burger, the Scallops, the Monk Fish and the Hanger Steak. Our waiter (whose name I didn't catch but he was wonderful!) recommended 4 of his favorite meals..and he definitely hit the nail on the head. The Cassoulet was my meal and while I was originally a bit overwhelmed when it was first placed on the table, the flavored came together so perfectly that it was so easy to eat. Another favorite of the bunch was the scallops with crab risotto. If you're a seafood lover, I recommend them!  We always go with the Brussel sprouts as a starter when we're here and they never disappoint.  All in all, a fantastic night out! We'll be back!",

We went here at prime time (7:30 pm) on a Saturday night and I was a little apprehensive that, despite our reservation, we might not be seated promptly.  I was wrong!  We were quickly escorted to the 3rd floor and a neat little table next to the railing, which gave us a perfect view of the establishment and a great way to check out the impressive whiskey wall.  I believe another reviewer labeled the decor as \"hunting lodge chic\".  Spot on!  There were interesting little trinkets and artifacts tucked in every nook and cranny.  My favorite was the outlandish taxidermy on the 3rd floor.  In particular, at the end of the bar on the 3rd floor there's a mounted rabbit with a squirrel riding it like a bucking bronco.  Fantastic!  I can't comment on the mixed drinks because I stuck with beer, but the beer selection was adequate.  This is a cocktail and whiskey place, so my expectations were met with the beer list.  Adequate but not impressive.  We tried the brussel sprouts, foccacia, and pig candy to start.  Brussel sprouts - ridiculous.  So good.  Chessy, buttery, is that a little lemon I taste on there?  Man, these were incredible!  And the \"small plate\" of brussel sprouts is A LOT of sprouts.  Easily enough for 4 people to get a decent serving.  Focaccia - meh. standard.  The whipped riccotta and parm spread was excellent!  Neither of us like olives, so the tapenade was lost on us.  The white bean dip was lacking.  It tasted like plain, pureed white beans.  This one needs some work.  Pig Candy - it was good, but I've had better at several other places.  Perhaps my least favorite part of it was that it was served as a 4 oz. hunk of fat that was not cut up in any way, shape or form.  I think the presentation needs a little work here.  Who doesn't like pork belly, though?  For the latter part of the meal and after being reasonably full from two small plates and bread, we decided to take advantage of the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week 4-course tasting menu.  I don't recall what each item was, but can say that the standout was the skirt steak with chimichurri.  The rest was good, but not super memorable.  We both enjoyed this place a lot and would go back.  Next time we'd tackle small plates only, since this seemed to be the real sweet spot.  Butcher hasn't been open too long, and it seems they are still trying to find their place, or should I say, find their \"plate\".  They have a few standouts, but need to continue to  build their arsenal of awesome dishes.   Keep it up, guys!",

The bar puts out drinks that are fun, approachable and creative. This place is a full-experience type of restaurant that runs as a fun, well oiled machine.",

It's always crowded and isn't a big space, so a little difficult to navigate inside.  But that's what you get when you have a good spot, lots of people want to go here.  Drinks are very good and most of the menu is great.  A few items could be nitpicked, but again I would never describe this as perfect cuisine.  The package of food, drink, decor, ambiance...all make it work",

    "text": "As my husband and I left the restaurant tonight, we both agreed it was hands down the best dining experience we've had in years. From the start, the staff was so welcoming and friendly. We arrived at 5:45pm for a 6 o'clock reservation on a Saturday night, but they seated us on the spot. We were seated at a small two top, right under the watchful eye of a giant stuffed black bear wearing a bowler hat. I loved the kitschy, rustic charm of the place right away.   We each had cocktails and started with two small plates, the focaccia bread and the crispy pig wing. The bread was served with three spreads; a white bean puree, an olive tempenade and a ricotta cheese spread. All so perfect with the warm bread. But, the pig wing. Oh the pig wing. Sweet and spicy, crispy and tender. It was amazing. I'm surprised we didn't fight over it.   I then had the Brussels sprouts and the Mac and cheese, two more small plates, while the husband had the scallops. Everything was served hot and beautifully plated. We shared our dishes, and the risotto that came with my husband's scallops was so good, I kept stealing bites. But my Brussels sprouts were hands down  my favorite part of the main course. Tossed in brown butter and served with a yummy lemon aoli, I could have eaten a pound of them. If 10 year old me would hear me raving over Brussels sprouts, she'd probably smack me, but they were really  that good.   I have to say the only negative is that the place is a little cramped; you are only about 12 inches from the diners on either side of you. But, the food was so good it honestly didn't matter, and they decorated the small space in such an inventive and playful way, it was so much fun to look around.  I also absolutely loved that the check is presented to you in a little book that you can write comments in about your experience. Ours was perfect.",

We ordered the Bone Marrow, MacNCheese, and tartare for apps. Incredible! The Bone Marrow had a mushroom-y taste to it so it wasn't like a straight bone marrow like Meat&Potatoes. Still good. Best MacNCheese in town, beating out the famous MacNCheese truck for sure. It had a perfect texture, not extremely cheesy, and great bread crust topping. The Tartare did not disappoint! Had a perfect flavor and smooth texture to it.   For entrees, we got the Dirty Pasta, Seafood (forgot what fish it was) and another dish I forgot the name of. All were amazing. Great flavor and great presentation.   I am definitely going back.",

Our party had the following: Scallops with crab risotto-very rich and well executed. Buttery and flavorful! Wagyu beef-wow this was amazing! The blue cheese was great with the dish, the steak cooked medium was perfect.  Short ribs-didn't try this dish but our friend said it was really good. Lemon cake dessert-I was just expecting a piece of regular lemon cake but instead got a slice of delicious airy and light lemon sponge cake with matcha green tea ice cream and meringue. It was so good!  All the drinks were stellar as well. We had the Moscow mule with jalapenos, the Irishman and some drink with bourbon and grand mariner, all were spot on in flavor and execution.  The only complaint I have is the women's bathroom, so weird with the two low stalls side by side, totally weird! Besides that this place is yummy!!!",

Then I went to Cure, and I realized how amazing a \"meat-centric\" (is that a thing?) restaurant could be.  Butcher and the Rye is the same way.  It's super-cool, and it's definitely worth going to check out the decor and the multi-story bar.  The food is good, but it didn't knock my socks off.  To wit, I ate there about two weeks ago and I have zero recollection of what I had even though the meal cost well over $100.    If you're a whiskey aficionado, as is my boyfriend, you'd probably love this place, but even he was underwhelmed by the food.    It's great when new, upscale, non-chain restaurants open in the Pittsburgh area.  But as of yet, Butcher and the Rye isn't worth the wait for a reservation.",

This makes it easy on the cooks but is sloppy for someone who can dine at the very best and has higher standards.  The focaccia was nothing special. The fried peppers were well prepared but overloaded with salt. We sent back the cauliflower dish.  It is very very loud which takes away from  its appeal  The reason for my low rating is the AC Was  on the wall next  to the bar and said 78 f It was so hot!  We were so uncomfortable, it ruined our experience totally. This is unacceptable. We sat at the downstairs bar. The upper floor must have been sweating from heat and humidity  No fans were  here to move air around. I was told the AC  units were scheduled to be fixed. I have a photo of the AC reading but can't find how to post it on here.  I wish they had vegan or vegetarian choices. The menu is full of all kinds of dead animal parts and sprinkled with dairy",

You enter trough a lively bar and are seated in one of several smallish eating area. Great decor sort of early hunting lodge with an antler chandelier, a stuffed bear and some mounted heads on the walls painted tables. Seating a bit crowded but that ended up being a plus as we had a nice conversation quite the table next to us. The menu is smallish but quite varied still in the meat & game style. The service was excellent our waitress was friendly informative and prompt. The food, which is really why you come was excellent. The crispy octopus was great. Nice char on the outside but very tender on the inside. The scallops with risotto were cooked to perfection. The rabbit dumplings were also flavorful well prepared. Dishes are small but satisfying. The deserts  were also very good the flourless chocolate cake and the apple fritters both topped with a small scoop of Maple Syrup ice-cream were the perfect finish. Overall an excellent dinner experience a nice finale to a great trip to Pittsburgh",

We got the cheese plate and tartar which was unnecessarily talked up and was just okay at best. We went because it keeps getting rave reviews and is constantly on top Pittsburgh Restaurants articles. But they struggled a lot with service and took a very long time with all of our dishes. The ambiance and decor is really nice but don't think it makes up for meals. I would probably never go back especially since it was so expensive.  Definitely think this place is over hyped and if you have a choice I would say go to Sienna Mercado which is on the same street or Nicky's Thai Kitchen.",

The food was very tasty but nothing wowed us.   I should note the evening did not get off to a positive start as the front of the house staff bungled our reservation. On arrival we were told the table we were booked in was still being used and were offered to wait for an indeterminate amount of time or eat in their lounge. We made the reservation about two months earlier - seemed pointless if the hostess treats the reservation as a suggestion and nothing more. We protested and were ultimately seated - to put salt on the wound there were about 4 empty two person tables in the dining room. While I appreciate that the restaurant needs to assign tables for a reservation, the restaurant could have easily moved things around and sat us at an empty table, rather than take the initial position that they did.   Fortunately, James and some tasty food redeemed the experience and overall Butcher and the Rye is worth the visit.",

That is - if your grandmother has a full house of friends on any given night of the week.   Don't get me wrong, it's not like your grandmother has a full house of people all the time, as I went on a Thursday night and the place was standing room only. Perhaps the best thing about the restaurant is the amazing range of foodstuffs. There is something for every palette on the menu.  I sat at the bar and had a fantastic burger with the starter cauliflower dish that rocked my world. The drink menu, including the selection of beers, both bottle and on tap, is truly unique.

My party made a reservation for 6:00 p.m. before a 7:30 p.m. show. We expressed this to the waiter immediately. Despite that, none of our food had arrived by the time our watches read 6:50 p.m. Finally, we received a couple of small plates we ordered to share.... but the entrees were nowhere in sight. The manager came over and offered to comp the appetizers (but not our cocktails) and admonished us for not allowing 30 minutes per course in our timeframe. (Which we actually did.... Remember we arrived at 6:00 p.m.) He informed us that there was no way we could foreseeably receive our dinner before the show, so not only did we have to endure being scolded by management, we had to run off to the show very dissatisfied and practically starved. Never in all of my years of dining here before shows has the service been this slow and the wait staff been this unaccommodating. 90 minutes before showtime has always been more than enough time to comfortably enjoy a meal. (Especially when my show was in a theater that was just across from the street.) I'm sad to have had this experience, but I can only guess that the business is so popular, it can survive providing unacceptable service. C'est la vie.",

    "text": "The decor of Butcher and the Rye is really beautiful.  Probably one of the best designed places in Pittsburgh.  It's rustic yet hip and welcoming for dinner or just drinks at the bar.  I made a reservation for 5:30pm, totally forgot about the insanity of downtown traffic on a weekday and got there are 5:50.  The host was gracious and accommodating to this bump in the road.  The only odd thing was that as soon as I got there, the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat.  There were several empty tables around me that didn't get filled until our dining experience was over (around 7:30) so I didn't understand what the rush was.  Other than that oddity, our waiter was very pleasant.  I ordered the potato leek soup and the scallops entree.  My dining partner ordered the Monkfish \"Osso Bucco\".  I was very much impressed with the potato leek soup.  The soup was accompanied by cheesy tater tots, confit bacon and a cute thinly sliced piece of toast.  The plate came out only with the accompaniments on them as the servers beautifully poured the soup around it.  Fancy, huh?  And so delicious.  The confit bacon is really incredible.  If I had done some better thinking I would have ordered two soups and called it a night.  I ordered the scallops dished based on many reviews here that I've read on Yelp.  It definitely did not disappoint.  I was torn between this and the monkfish, but this was surely the more heartier dish.  The scallops, risotto, and asparagus were executed well but in general this dish did not wow me.  That's not to say that it wasn't delicious but for me a dish like this looses points for originality.  The flavors were pretty standard.  At the end of the meal I was pretty stuffed, but I'd love to come back for dessert (and more soup).",

We were looking for a delicious bite to eat after a long drive from NYC and checked out butcher and the rye (partly because of the s'more dessert) and it was excellent. Small plates are quite reasonable in size. The pig wing was our favorite followed by the dirty pasta and the bone marrow. We ordered the shishito peppers for something green but they weren't anything special. We weren't that impressed by the pig candy but other reviewers seemed to love it. The only strange thing about the restaurant was that they had a lot of open tables but originally told us they were full- maybe they didn't have enough staff or they were making a statement because we didn't have a reservation? It all worked out in the end. Best bet is probably to make a reservation. Also great selection of beer and whiskey.",

Obviously, none of the women in the restaurant were very excited about this, so there was a long line for the single-use accessible bathroom.  I would only go if I had a friend to come in with me and guard the door.

    "text": "From the outside, I would never have guessed what I was walking into. Having had reservations for over a month, I was excited to finally get to try out one of Pittsburgh's hot new restaurants. When I walked inside, I felt like I had been transported to a lodge in the middle of nowhere Montana. The rustic decor was frightening yet welcoming. Despite the fanged animals on the walls and tables, I felt very warm and comfortable . . . until I got to our table. After two flights of stairs, (love how the set up of several levels), we were sat at a lounge table with short padded stoles and a small table which was much more appropriate for pre-dinner cocktails, not an entire meal. After looking over the menu, I was tempted by the cocktails but decided to order a glass of wine. The wine selection is very small. I ordered the ham and biscuits (country ham) as well as the cauliflower. I also had the pleasure of trying the mac n cheese and the brussel sprouts. The ham plate arrived first. The salty ham was a great compliment to the biscuits and the orange marmalade was wonderful but, the biscuits were still dry. The cauliflower arrived quite a bit later. The yogurt gave the dish a distinct tanginess that somewhat resembled pickled cauliflower to me. With the description stating there were carrots and brown butter, I was expecting a more savory dish. The best part of my meal so far was the couple of bites of the mac n cheese that I tasted from my dining companions. It was the creamiest, most decadent dish I have had in  . . . well, ever. Since I had room for dessert, I went with the deep fried brownie. It took quite some time for the dessert to arrive. More than 20 minutes actually. Luckily, it was well worth the wait. Remember when you would lick the spoon after mom put the brownies in the oven? Now imagine that uncooked brownie goodness, warm with a crispy outside. Incredible! The bananas and the sorbet were the perfect compliment. Also, unlike the other dishes, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of this dish. Definitely enough to share (two brownies) though you won't want to. It was easily the best dessert I have had since I can remember. Overall, the food was hit or miss for me. The dishes that were on, were incredible while the dishes that were off were only so-so.",

Neither of us are whisky drinkers but thought if we are ever to enjoy a whiskey this would be the place as they have 500 whiskeys on hand.  And talk about top-shelf!  The bottles behind the first floor bar (there is also one on the third floor) are on shelves that extend up three stories.        We did enjoy the whiskey flight experience, but it was because of the atmosphere, not the whiskey.  This is not the fault of the restaurant.  We just are not whiskey drinkers.  We'll get wine or beer next time, both of which we enjoy.  We were seated on the top floor of the three-level establishment adjacent to the bar.  We had early reservations so that we could enjoy a leisurely dining experience.  And enjoy we did. We ordered bread (accompanied by three spreads), Caesar salad (w/kale, not romaine), mushroom soup, and two short plates--pig candy and grilled Brussel sprouts. We shared everything.  Everything was very good.  My wife ordered the mushroom soup and as it turned out, it was my favorite item even though the pig candy was as good as other reviewers say.  The mushroom soup was the best I've ever had and it may be the best soup of any kind that I've had.  We will return.",

It was nice looking and intimate, but pretty close to the tables on either side, which has its pluses and minuses.  We had nice conversations with our neighbors, but not much privacy.  We ordered small plates, which were really good.  My duck liver pate was generous and very creamy, with a good cover (like a gelatin, but a little sweet) on top.  My next course, the bone marrow, was to die for.  A large bone, marrow still in, serve warm with parsley over it.  My wife's macs and cheese were creamy, with a nutty swiss cheese flavor and the portion was generous.   The downside is that the place is quite noisy, with low ceilings and little sound absorption.",

All were tasty, but I must admit the Pittsburgh Smash was my favorite. The bar area is small, and after dinner got very crowded, but luckily the bartenders were attentive and the service was great. One thing from this experience that I can assure you won't get elsewhere is the decor... Very interesting but difficult to describe and so worth the trip to see firsthand! We ordered the Brussels sprouts, duck pasta, crispy pig wing, pig candy, wagyu flank, as well as one of their flank steak specials. The Brussels sprouts (crispy and heavenly) and dirty duck pasta (perfectly cooked protein and noodle) were the winners! We ordered a little more than what our lovely waitress thought fit for a dinner for two, but no matter, the leftovers were just as tasty the next day. I will definitely be back!",

We shared several small plates and each had a main course.  Everything was excellent.  The wagu brisket is a must if they have it.  So are the brussel sprouts.  Drinks were well made.  I would highly recommend.",

Very trendy and a place people go to be seen or to say I've been there. Prices are high to make it a regular spot but would go back for a special night on the town. I recommend the pig candy and brussel sprouts. Try the duck liver if you can get past what it is. So rich and creamy! Want to give this place 4 stars but couldn't based on the cost. I expected the bill to be higher but $200 for a few small plates and a few drinks is a lot.",

I have been coming to Pittsburgh once or twice a year for work for a decade---I love this town and its awesome restaurant scene. After a long day of work on this cold winter night all I wanted to do was grab some good food and go back to my cozy warm hotel room. I have never been to this restaurant before but have heard and read good things and wanted to try it this visit....however, upon arriving I was informed that they do not accommodate take-way orders. The arrogance and audacity of this chef are amazing---not just for Pittsburgh but for any city! I will never set foot in this restaurant and will tell everyone I know about this appalling customer service. Spend your money at any of the other amazing Pittsburgh restaurants that appreciate and accommodate their guests and don't turn them away. Sad. I would not give this restaurant even 1 star but u have to in order to leave a review.",

The tables have little oil lamps on them, our flame was a little \"stronger\" than the ones on other tables. A server made a beeline for us and proceeded to reprimand US for the candle while grabbing and turning down the oil. Apparently he assumed we turned it up. The rest of the time there was uncomfortable because he was standing telling the other servers about us, they all kept staring. I would not return here purely because of the way I was treated here. If he thought the candle was too much, I get it, come fix it, but don't get snippy with me when I did nothing wrong. Rude.",

    "text": "Look at those orange stars. Maybe I missed something.  I am just underwhelmed. It was the thought I had for most of the night and exactly what +1 said when we left. It had that \"good, but not great\" for as much awesome praise I've heard for Butcher and The Rye. Especially after being taken to a beautiful sugar bread dream brunch at its older brother Meat and Potatoes, I wanted a spiced bread dream dinner here.  Not the case. I don't want to leave three stars as I did enjoy it, but we probably won't be back.  We made reservations, which you should probably do (and can do, right here, on this page, on Yelp!).  The place itself is a wreck of gothic damask and mixed sets of encyclopedias meets cabin full of taxidermy.  There are a few themes going on here, and it is looking rougher than Kennywood's new version of Noah's Ark. When you walk in, there are big, reclaimed wood style tables and a massive bar which is gorgeous, but upstairs is a different story (the 2nd story, that is.. ha!).  We were seated in the hell that is parties of two along the wall where even I had a hard time wedging between them--and we're a small people.  When others are eating, they do not typically want my bum on their table.  With our drinks, the Jessica Rabbit and the Frankly, My Dear, we were all right. The Jessica Rabbit was a generic gin and juice.  Frankly was a little bit (emphasis on LITTLE BIT .. it was a third of a rocks glass) of whiskey with a whole buncha sweet.  But the real deal here is supposed to be the food, right? I had been scouring the menu for over a week as I don't eat beef or pig (AKA why did you go here, lady?).  Luckily, they had the mac n cheese and focaccia for which I threw my lactose intolerance to the wind and went for it. +1 eats anything, so the pig candy and onion soup sounded great.  Everything came out in these tornados of small plates to the tiniest table.  The focaccia was all mine.  A loaf covered in onions--some cooked, some not so lucky--and not much else to note, served with a ricotta whip that could have been Philadelphia, a white bean paste which tasted exactly how it sounds, and an olive tapenade that could have been roasted red pepper mush for all I know.  I hate having no positive opinion on something, so the bread itself was not bad.  I actually did like the mac n cheese a lot, if only for the toasted shredded top.  And they were shells! Praise the pasta gods.  +1 didn't rave about anything. The candy was a square of pig, the onion soup tasted very .. earthy.  I ended up saying forget it, box up half the dinner, order another drink and dessert. The second drink was probably the worst choice of the night.  The \"10th Circle\" is listed as gin, lime, chartreuse, rosemary, ginger, curry tea. That's all.  When I received a typical looking gimlet, I was excited.  But then I found a heavy sprinkle of what I guess was cayenne on top.  Why. You forgot to tell me that part. Welcome to the 10th circle?  Probably should have seen that coming. I passed most of it off to +1.  I had been dreaming of the s'mores all day.  A scoop of fried ice cream with bourbon marshmallows and chocolate? Absolutely.  This was worth it.  Everything else didn't hit it off with me.  I actually recommend to come here for just dessert.  I wonder if they serve ice cream at the bar.",

Unlike some restaurants, the careful preparation meant that the flavors were creative, well-balanced, and sophisticated instead of being superficially trendy and confused.

I would heartily recommend all of them, though I was seriously tempted by my companion's salted caramel apple dessert.  The service was friendly and efficient but not intrusive.

Unfortunately, we had a negative interaction with the manager after the hostess offered to cover a few starters when we had to wait awhile to sit (we had a reservation). We mentioned it to our waitress and she sent the manager (Brian) over to our table. He showed up, immediately started talking down to us, and eventually loudly announced, among other things and with a bit of attitude, \"No, I don't think that's gonna happen...\" In front of my whole family. What an awkward and unprofessional way to handle the situation... Instead of a free starter, we had asked if they would consider a reasonable discount on a $50 bottle of wine they have on their menu for $125. The bizarre, confrontation-esque conversation made us feel uncomfortable and we decided to leave. We weren't trying to take advantage of anyone and didn't really appreciate being treated that way. Brian could have said just about anything else and it would have been totally fine... He didn't have to be such a jerk.",

Patient explanation from a fun and attentive server (who mentioned how her boyfriend, a non-judgmental vegan, wouldn't be able to eat a single thing on the menu). Food highlights included the bone marrow and flank steak. The Moscow mule was possibly the best I've had. Decor is a gaudy hunter's party. Rumor had it that Sidney Crosby was dining at a back table.

I really debated between 2-3 stars, but I really felt that the tagline that accompanies 2 stars is pretty accurate.  \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Crispy Pig Wing - this was probably the best dish of the night.  Tasted kind of like sweet and sour chinese pork.  Summer Squash - there was barely any squash on the board and consisted of a bunch of sauces smeared around, definitely not worth it!  Bone Marrow - at first, we were impressed by the size of the dish, but after taking a few bites, we were again very disappointed.  There wasn't much flavor to the bone marrow.    Beet Salad - a very meh salad.  consisted mainly of romaine lettuce.  Steak Frites - decent, nothing special.  At this point, though we were pretty disappointed with the entire meal and were hoping for something more memorable.  We also ordered drinks, all of which were decent and probably the only thing I would suggest coming back to Butcher and the Rye for.  The decor and space are great.  (Except that it is a tad bit on the dark side, so you can barely see what you're eating...)  The atmosphere is fun, but the food just wasn't very good.  I really wanted to like this place, but I'm going to suggest that you only come here if you're looking for a place to grab drinks downtown in a nice setting.",

Firstly, if you plan on going here, make your reservation a week in advance (at least). It books up very quickly. That being said, it was overly crowded at the bar. The bar tenders were rather slow but that may have something to do with their interesting cocktail menu. We opted for plain whiskey and champagne while we waited for our table.  We were seated in the bar area upstairs next to some extremely loud patrons. They were so loud that I had a ringing in my ear for the rest of the evening. We moved to another table, but the table was so tiny that we couldn't even fit our water and bar drinks on it, let alone food. After the noisy people left, we moved back to our better spot.   The food.... was okay. The cheese board, which was $18, was not worth it at all. The cheese did not seem fresh and the accompaniments were mediocre (a few homemade jams, honey, apples). My husband had the seared sea bass and it was rubbery in the middle and not quite seared. The crispy topping was gummy. My wagyu steak, however, was delicious. I got it medium rare and they subbed out some things I was allergic to with no questions asked.   Overall, I am not sure we will go back for anything but a late night drink.",

We wanted to try the s'mores dessert but just ran out of room! We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "(been here for work drinks in the past but just getting this yelp thing started:))  While waiting for a table at the sister restaurant Tako, my friends and I decided to grab a drink here. Pretty cool that they are connected by a doorway near the bar.  The whiskey wall is very impressive and dominates the main floor decor. There are apparently over 700 selections and they have an iPad you can use to search through while making your choice. The service was quick and friendly. Also, the bartender made some great recommendations. We had Four Roses bourbon on the rocks and Old Fashioned's made with Angel's Envy, both were excellent.   The hostess from tako came over to let us know our table was ready, nice touch! I really like this place and will be back to grab a full meal in the future. Definitely a big fan of Richard Deshantz's spots (tako, Butcher & Rye, and Meat & Potatoes)",

Sarcasm and a meal here might kill you.  The Dirty Pasta was like eating a dish (of salt) of salty pasta in uber-salty gravy.  The Pig Candy was one (1) piece of what a Chinese restaurant would serve a whole plate of.  It was ok, just yes, salty.  Mussels were just ok, have had better.  The flourless chocolate cake was a disappointment :-(  definitely have had better!  Highlight of the nite: my drink - the BEST Smith & Currins I have ever had.  She did a great job on that!    Overall, the ambience of the place is nice - but dark, oh so dark.  So if you pass out from all the salt, they might not find your body til the lights come on (if ever).",

We tried several smoky 30-40$ shots , very strong!! Lol..I also had an absinthe drink which included gin, could not finish my 2nd one , very potent..the music ranged from Michael Jackson to what I swear was old dirty bastard to jazz lol.. It was a bit loud upstairs ..one annoying factor was that while making drinks the bartenders would pound on ice(?) with a mallet, could do without that..    Our waitress was Sara and after taking our initial orders for drinks and an appetizer she disappeared for 20 min ( we chose the charcuterie ) It was very tasty but I can't honestly tell you what the meats or sides were even though they were explained ( again a bit loud in there ). She forgot to bring my guests beer but we did not end up having to pay for it.  It was during her absence that we wished to try several more shots and she missed out on the opportunity to make more $ .   I ordered the scallops and blue crab risotto and it did not disappoint with its crunchy asparagus on top. Perfectly cooked and scrumptious. My guest had the hangar steak and it was wonderfully cooked. We also ordered apple pie for desert and a coffee flavored creme pot..again very fresh and awesome taste .   We will definitely be back to try some different food next time and more whiskey.. Very nice place for a romantic dinner ..or to chat and get drinks with the girls..",

    "text": "SETTING: Dimly lit, with a complete bar inside the restaurant. Pretty unique layout. Waiters bring the food up from a kitchen located downstairs? The bathrooms were also unconventional. Go check it out!  FOOD: For appetizers, I shared the pig candy and Brussels sprouts with my friends. My main entree, I got the Dirty pasta (with ground duck).  I couldn't help but think of one word when dining here: \"salty\". I'm not sure if Butcher and the Rye tends to be a bit more heavy handed with the salt, or if it was this one occurrence. But the Brussels sprouts and Dirty Pasta definitely were more than a bit salty to me.   Brussels sprouts were large enough in quantity to share with a large group. My one friend described it best, \"Kind of tastes like the Cool Ranch Doritos\". The taste was so empowering that I honestly could not taste the Brussels sprouts at all, which is unfortunate.  Pig Candy was pretty decent. A small plate for one, it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. I sometimes judge how much I like a plate by evaluating my willingness to part with it and order something else the next time I come back. Let's just say, I'd probably give another appetizer a chance.    Dirty Pasta was unique; first time I ever had \"ground\" duck. The noodles were thick and chewy with bits of ground duck sprinkled into the pasta. The sauce was good, but again, a bit salty, so I did not enjoy it as much as I could have. Out of what we ordered, my friends liked this dish most.   SERVICE: Need to reserve in advance! This place gets booked fast especially for dinners on Friday and Saturdays. Very polite wait staff and professional.  IMPRESSIONS: I wish I could say I would highly recommend this place, after hearing the hype surrounding this restaurant. Unfortunately I don't think I can at this time. I don't think my friends were that blown away either. Too much salt :( and nothing that stood out to us.",

I told him that we had a reservation, he grabbed 2 menus and told us to follow him.  He took us upstairs to a tiny table right up against another table of diners.  There were probably 3 tables taken at this point.  Sitting there would have put my back against the woman at the other table.  I didn't want to be uncomfortable while we were eating so I asked for another table.  He seemed irritated and then showed us to another table.  I will say that the new table was nice - in a private spot and had plenty of room.  Our waiter was fine but didn't blow us away.

We got the Brussels, cheese plate, and pork belly. Drinks were fun and very good. Our waitress was very knowledgeable when it came to suggesting a whisky for my old fashion.  Also there's something intriguing about a whisky bar with such an extensive selection the menu is on an ipad. That being said I will say drinks felt overpriced as well.  $45 for a 1 oz pour of JW blue label  (A high end blended scotch) is steep so I found it hard to believe that's not the case for the other selections.",

I go to Meat and Potatoes more that I go to see my family (and they live nearby), and this was the absolute worst display of customer service that I have ever seen.  We booked a reservation for ten people over a month ago, for 9:45 PM, to celebrate a huge achievement for my sister. We wanted to make sure that we didn't lose our spot and decided to arrive at 9:30. 9:45 rolls around and the horrible hosts let time pass without giving TEN of us an update. Instead 9:55, no update. The two hosts were absolutely terrible, made zero effort to talk to us at all about the delay or what would happen next. We had to proactively ask how long the delay would be. We were especially ready to eat since we had an 8 year old girl with us, who had not eaten dinner due to the graduation. The two hosts said well I guess we can look at the table upstairs but they are about to start dessert and we don't ask people to leave. Now it's after 10:00 and nothing has been said to a party of TEN, completely dressed up. So I started making calls to nearby restaurants to see who could accommodate our party. I guess they are too fancy to care about ten people, but I know other businesses/servers would kill to wait on a group that is celebrating.  Luckily, Six Penn Kitchen stepped up and we left immediately.   I get that this restaurant doesn't have to have good customer service, because customers pour into these restaurants. But this is beyond disappointing and frustrating. As a downtowner, I'm here to tell you that there are restaurants down here that want and deserve your business. I'll take a good experience at restaurant that isn't well known, over a bad experience that disrespects their customers' time.",

I liked the atmosphere and the comfortable seats upstairs, but the noise was so overbearing from the bar that you can't talk unless you're raising your voice. That was the biggest complaint I had and the biggest reason on why I may not go back. The food: Pig Wing app: basically a very meaty rib served with an Asian flair. The rib was very tender and was slightly crispy in the outside. I thought it was pretty tasty.  Ceaser salad: the salad was pretty decent. Served with plenty of cheese and placed over a grilled piece of bread which I found to be a nice touch. Flank Steak: the steak was really good. It's one of he better steaks I've had in quite awhile. It was almost presented like a beef stew as it had potatoes and a gravy. It also had some blue cheese on it. That's never a bad idea with meat in my opinion.  Pot De Creme: this was REALLY good. Multiple layers of chocolate, whip cream on top, and a lemony cake of sort out on top. It was rich, but an exceptional dessert.",

We thought we had to wait forever but they called us As we were trying to pay for the first drink. The service was friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. I got the dirty pasta and my husband got the steak. Full of flavor and large portions! The pasta was cooked perfectly. My biggest pet peeve, living in Washington DC is spending $80 and bring underwhelmed with dinner and still hungry. Not the case here. Yes slightly pricey but worth every penny!!",

We were sat upstairs at a lovely table overlooking the dining below and we had a great view of the entire place.  Our server, Sam, did a great job getting us hooked up.  Our meal was delicious!  We started with both pig appetizers, because pig.  We were not disappointed.  I could have eaten 10 plates of just those.   We didn't.  We each had a salad, which was good, not amazing but good (beet salad for me).  We shared the dirty pasta and I was glad I had read on here that the portion size was huge, because 2 plates of that would have killed us.  We would have died delicious deaths, but would have missed out on dessert.  The real star was the pasta, but we weren't sad by any of it.  Food and service were great.  We will definitely try this place out again!",

We ordered 4 \"small plates\" it was plenty of food. We had the pate. Smooth, creamy heaven. The Mac and cheese i would marry. The pork candy, which is really like pork fat with a little crunch on the outside. Just melts in your mouth so good. And the beef carpaccio. It has a duck egg on top with a bit of truffle oil. Not usually a huge fan of carpaccio but this was amazing. Can't go wrong.",

So we stopped in the other night after a Pirates game, and surprisingly there was no wait, which was awesome.  The inside of the restaurant is super cool.. seriously, love.  We got our menus when we sat, and maybe it just wasn't what we were in the mood for at that time, but we were just not overly impressed with the menu.  We only ordered an appetizer (filled up on beer and junk food during the game, of course) and by suggestion of our server we ordered the Sunday Gravy, which I'll admit was pretty fantastic.  I would have never chosen this particular dish on my own, because I just think little lambs are too cuddly and cute to be eaten- however, that night I through all emotional attachment I have to farm animal babies out the window, and I showed that Sunday Gravy who was boss.  It was that good.    With that said, we finished our little lamb dish and called it a night.  I wont say that I'll never go back, because that wouldn't be fair.  I will say, though, that I'll know for next time what to expect, and be sure that I've got the right appetite-mood going next time I go.",

So my partner and I recently road tripped up to Lake Chautauqua New York to spend some time with family and realized that Pittsburgh was on the way.  Having never visited Pittsburgh we thought we'd stop off for a night and check it out.  What a great city!  We were totally blown away and this restaurant was a big part of it.  This joint really hits on all cylinders!  The staff was welcoming and friendly, the drinks were extremely well crafted and the food and table service were divine.  We started with old fashioned's and a \"bees knees\" at the bar and were seated quickly for our 9:00 reservation ( yes this place is that popular).  We decided to stick to small plates and were rewarded handsomely!  The standouts from dinner were the brussel sprouts, steak tartare, and the \"pig candy\" (pork belly).  The brussel sprouts were crispy fried and absolutely drenched in butter and Parmesan cheese and the tartare was properly finished with an egg yolk.  The pork belly was decadent and not lost in the glaze that it was prepared in which was nice.  We were not disappointed by the wine list and truly had a wonderful evening here.  If you find yourself way out that way, check it out and eat up y'all!",

If you are a party of 6 or more I recommend you try and get this table. The weather was lovely and the doors were open onto the street, and the ambience was fantastic. This place is a whiskey lovers dream, they have a huge wall of whiskey, with (I think) over 500 on the menu. I'm not into whiskey myself, however I had a whiskey cocktail the rye Buck with lime and ginger that was probably one of the better cocktails I've ever had.  The wait staff are excellent, they are fun, friendly, hip and make your experience a great one. The restaurants design is seriously cool, we loved it! It is incredibly interesting, for no other reason, if you do to want to eat (which you should as the food is outstanding) go for a drink or 3.  Food was wonderful, we split some appetizers and then all ordered a main meal. Everyone loved their meal, and we were an eclectic bunch. I had the scallops, and loved loved loved the blue crab risotto that it is served with, they were seriously good. Word to the women, the female bathroom is \"interesting\" check it out. I will not ruin it for you, but it's a talking point. Basically you cannot go wrong here, it was probably one of our favorite restaurants that we tried while in Pittsburgh.",

Seated upstairs, where it can be a bit cramped, but the atmosphere & decor is really fun, the music was great, and it's nice and cozy for a date.  HAVE THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS.  PERIOD.  These are probably the best Brussels sprouts that I've ever had, and I've had a lot of good Brussels sprouts!  The pork belly just melts in your mouth, and the charcuterie was excellent.  Our waiter, Josh, was super attentive, and when I was ready for a whiskey, and asked for a nice smooth scotch, Josh recommended a 12-year single malt from Auchentoshan Distillery, and it was spot-on.  It's pricey because you're going to want to have a cocktail or whiskey, but it's absolutely worth every penny.  Just go to Butcher and the Rye, and find out for yourself - you will not be disappointed.",

If you're already outraged, stop reading.   My first night in Pittsburgh - just arrived from Philadelphia. We asked the concierge at the hotel if we could get into this restaurant and she had a good relationship with the maitre d. He had a table outside if we could come right away. We did. He asked us to sit at the bar while the table finished up. No problem, we like to sit at the bar before dinner. Good things to say about the bar - attentive, great drinks.   Time passes and the maitre 'd makes two more stops saying can't get people out of their seats. Funny thing though, saw an empty table outside when we arrived. Last time through, maitre 'd tells us a couch In a bar upstairs has space. We agree, and it's one of those things you kick yourself for later. Waiter nice, but totally uncomfortable for dinner and they forgot to put in our entrees.  Chicken was good, rabbit undercooked. They rushed it out.   Very expensive night, fair food, poor dining experience. This is the second restaurant in 2 different cities where the bar was ok and dining poor. I think I'm going to stick with tapas  at good bars.

The brussels sprouts and Sunday gravy were really good and because we were four sharing, they didn't fill us up too much. As main I had the rabbit with buttermilk dumplings.

    "text": "excellent service with lots of information about each dish and each drink. started with the dry aged tartare, which was my favorite dish based on taste and presentation. after this was the marrow, which was tastey and i especially liked the oxtail jam. after this came the brussels which were salty but very very good. then came the crispy octopus with chickpea puree which was good. then i got the filet which was very good and the bone marrow custard that goes with it is amazing. then i got scallops over blue crab risotto which was probably the best tasting dish of the night. then came doughnuts which were good. then the chocolate cheesecake, the passion fruit sorbet topping was my favorite part of any dish of the night.   only complaint i have is the lighting was pretty dim i would have liked to been able to see my food better. also they charge $8 per bottle of Voss water but we were also given 2 other options of waters.   Overall great experience and will be returning to try the mussels, mac n cheese, and dirty pasta.",

We were both a big fan of the decor and it was a really cool environment. Being the first people in I was hoping to get a better seat but it wasn't overly concerned about it. We got in and seated right on time and ordered some drinks. He had the Wild Kind and I indulged in the Jack Rose... both were great! For an appetizer we went with the brussel sprouts, oh my lanta, they were delicious! I can't say enough good things about them, you get a big portion and from the smell of them to the taste, they were amazing! The main course I went with the Butcher Burger and it was probably the best burger I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and was absolutely delicious. Hubby had the braised rabbit and dumplings, and while i couldn't bring myself to try it, he loved it! We were very interested in trying the ginger bread dessert but we're so full that we couldn't do it, next time! The only negatives I can think of is that the tables upstairs are sooo close together and considering we were the very first people in the restaurant our food took a loooong time. The table next to us was finished eating before we got our meals and a few other tables were half way done. We were told that the kitchen got backed up but it was worth the wait! We will be back.",

The bartenders are very knowledgeable and willing to create different drinks if you tell them your preferences and price range.

It is a great atmosphere and nothing like anything you will find in Pittsburgh.  Just make sure you plan ahead, because reservations are hard to come by!

Our bartender Amanda is clearly a whiskey and rye connoisseur and helped us adventure into new whiskey we had not tried before. Perfectly poured our Manhattans, and was very attentive. She even gave me her own personal portable charger to charge my phone that was almost dead! The food was equally amazing - we had the brussels sprouts (totally delicious) and the duck neck ragu (what a surprise how meaty and flavorful this was!). This place gets busy, and I can see why. Check out the amazing wall of whiskey - quite unique and impressive. We sat at the bar as it was very busy, but so glad we did so we could chat about spirits with Amanda.",

The food, drinks, service, and ambiance were wonderful. I'm a big fan and can't wait to get back. I need to remember that they take reservations, too, but sitting at the bar worked very well. The only down side is that they don't open until 5, so if you're trying to get there early to get a seat and get there too early, you have to figure out where to wander around (and in this heat, how not to melt before the bar opens).",

The seasonal salad was tasty, but smaller than expected. Our server recommended the dry aged tartare multiple times, and it didn't disappoint. The kitchen kindly substituted chips for bread as a gluten-free option.  All in all, it was a great upscale dining experience in Pittsburgh. Would love to return.",

I appreciate that Butcher and the Rye menu prices aren't that ridiculous, but I had confidence that the portions were generous and the quality of food was great. Our mission was to try as much of the menu as we could so we decided on the small Dirty Pasta, small scallops (came with 1 but it was a HUGE scallop), Brussels and the Sunday Gravy. The only thing I didn't like was the Sunday Gravy which was a little too salty and savory for me.. also the bread was crunchy and hard, would've preferred a softer French bread to scoop up the lamb neck and the rest of the rich dish. Dirty Pasta was what I looked forward most to and was not disappointed. Left full and satisfied but not overstuffed (been trying to work on that) and would definitely come back! Great for date night, felt like I was on an adventure with all the taxidermy, attentive servers and restaurant decorations. So creative!",

The reservation process online was super easy and parking was accessible nearby (we couldn't find street parking, but parking at many of the garages downtown is $4 in the evenings). We started off with a few drinks - the Black Dahlia and the Punch. The Black Dahlia was well made and had some interesting ingredients (including activated charcoal & egg white), so I found it a pretty enjoyable experience. The Punch had a really nice grapefruit flavor and was easy to drink.   For the meal, we split the octopus appetizer, cauliflower appetizer, and Dirty Pasta entree. All were delicious - with the cauliflower & pasta both being pretty large servings. The octopus was pretty awesome - I usually stay away from octopus since it tends to be chewier (personal preference), but the octopus a BatR was lightly breaded, tender, super soft, and super tasty! The cauliflower was very well seasoned as well and filling. We enjoyed the Dirty Pasta, although it did get to be a bit too much/rich for us at the end - a pretty heavy entree but great for sharing!  For dessert, we decided to share the Peaches & Cream donuts - 3 donut holes rolled in cinnamon w/ a scoop of peach ice cream on the side & a couple slices of glazed spiced peaches. It was delicious and a perfect way to end a very hearty meal!   Finally, the service was also very organized & courteous, with the staff being very knowledgeable about the menu as well as approachable for questions. BatR is a great spot for special occasions or a nice dinner (bill for the 2 of us came to ~$90, including tip). A highly recommended spot!",

Heard they had the best Old Fashioned in town. The low light rustic vibe made me almost forget my purpose there. I almost ran into a table I was looking around so much trying to drink in all my eyes could handle.   It was too cool to be hipster but too hip to be retro so I'd place this lounge in a category all its own. I made it to the upstairs bar and ordered my old fashioned. It was in fact delicious, not too sweet not too bitter just right! After ordering a second choice and leaving it up to the bartender I was brave enough to dive into the food selection.   This dry aged tartare was so interesting with all the flavor combinations and yet I couldn't stop eating it. Simply delicious. Was thinking about that meal and those drinks the rest of my trip. Thanks for surpassing expectations...we need a place like yours out west.",

    "text": "Food and service here were great. Also loved the eccentric decor. We started with the bread, followed by the marrow, cheeseboard, dirty pasta, and the burger. The bread, I absolutely recommend! I was a bit put off at first for having to separately order bread for the table, but it was definitely worth it. The gravy and the infused butter were amazingly flavorful. It took me everything I had to not be a savage and just drink the gravy. Cheeseboard was also quite good, but not remarkable as far as cheeseboards go. This was the first time I ever had bone marrow so I wasn't quite sure what to expect for that dish. Somehow I did not realize marrow had the consistency of fat, which I generally do not like. But putting the marrow on the crostinis topped with a brisket-like meat, a bit of cilantro, and a pinch of sea salt... it was like a party in my mouth. It was so flavorful and extremely well balanced - I just wished they gave more of the bread with brisket. As for the burger and dirty pasta, that's when things went downhill. Flavor-wise, they were on point. The flavor of the pasta was rather unique and had a great depth to it. This was also one of the few times I've had pasta that was actually cooked al dente properly. The burger was good for a burger (though I've had better). However, these two dishes were so unbelievably salty. They were good the first few bites, but soon enough, we found ourselves quite dehydrated and chugging water. Had those two dishes been not as salty, I would've easily given this restaurant a full 5-stars. One last gripe I had about this place would be that the tables are too close together. Half my memory of the night was the lady next to me yammering away about her food expertise. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this restaurant, and will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "This is our favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about it is perfect, from the beautiful, woodsy decor to the amazing display selection of the whiskey bar and most of all, the FOOD.  We came here for Valentine's Day, not that we ever have trouble finding an excuse to come here. We were seated upstairs (there is a bar area, communal tables and seating downstairs, and more seating and another, more secluded bar upstairs). Note that some tables upstairs are very close together, but we weren't seated at those tables.  Our waitress was extremely attentive, always refilling water and making sure we were ok. I ordered the Wild Kind cocktail, which was a bourbon cocktail that was a great blend of sour and smokey. But honestly, I've never had a cocktail here that I didn't love. The cocktail menu is always changing, and it's always super creative.  We ordered the gnudi (special for V day) and the brussel sprouts to start. The gnudi was light and decadent, and the brussel sprouts were perfectly roasted with just the right amount of lemon and presented with a delicious lemon aioli.  For dinner, we got the scallops with blue crab risotto and the rainbow trout with anchovy vinaigrette. I dream about this risotto. The scallops are always perfectly seared and so buttery (texture wise), and the risotto is so heavenly every single time. It is my FAVORITE meal in Pittsburgh. The rainbow trout was also delicious, perfectly seared as well, and the anchovy vinaigrette definitely added something different. Delicious.  For dessert, we got the amaretto cheesecake (on special for V day). Everything on this plate was perfection, from the luxardo cherries oozing with flavor to the light, fluffy cheesecake to the lightly toasted marshmallows and the sorbet.  Honestly, if I could eat the scallops with blue crab risotto every day, I would be the happiest person on the planet. I love Butcher so much, from the service to the food to the ambiance.",

The service was amazing. Our waitress was Casey and she was very accommodating when it came to how we wanted our food presented and she was great and giving advice on things we didn't even think of.

    "text": "I'm torn when it comes to Butcher and the Rye.  The food and drinks were fantastic.  The service was decidedly not.    I walked in just shortly after they opened (literally minutes after the door was opened) on a Wednesday or Thursday night.  I was in town for business and was starving.  I walked to the host stand and said \"Hi, just one\" and the host looked at me like I had three heads.  He finally, after looking around the restaurant as if for backup, said \"only the bar is available, if that's not ok for you...well...\" then looked to the woman standing next to him.  Unsure if he was done with me or not but pretty hungry I walked over to the bar and sat down.    I tried one of the signature cocktails, the Black Dhalia, which was very good.  Sort of a toxic detox cocktail with rye, activated charcoal, lemon, tea, and egg whites.  As I already said, I was starving, so I started with the sourdough bread which came with some delicious gravy for dipping.  I decided to go with one of the evenings specials; the beef heart bolognese and I was very happy I did.  I was wonderful.  Especially paired with a fantastic red wine by the glass. I love the decor and atmosphere.  It's very dark, warm, and cozy.  Think woodsy chic.    So the food pretty much made up for the not so warm welcome at the door.  But listening to the bartender tell other patrons \"If someone comes in and orders an old fashioned with Bulleit I just tell them \"No.  Pick something else\"\" made me twitchy.  I realize they have tons of rye and whiskey to pick from and would like to broaden the palate of their customers when they can.  But if I order a drink and the bartender says \"No.\" because they want me to try something else I'm not going to be there very long.  And, having to flag down the bartender (at a very small bar) to get their attention got old really fast.       The food was fantastic but the service almost negated it.  I'd probably go back but not before I try any number of other restaurants in the area.  For the food and decor/atmosphere I'd say 5 stars.  For the service I'd probably go with 2.   One more thing...what's with the bolt under the bar?  Is it supposed to be there?  Like to hang a purse or coat on?  Or is it just shoddy workmanship and a lawsuit waiting to happen?  I scraped my knee on it twice.  If it's just a bolt sticking out from under the bar: Get rid of it, it's sharp and dangerous.  If it's a coat/purse hook: a bolt is a stupid choice and get rid of it, it's sharp and dangerous.",

One of my favorite things to do is the design your own cocktail by telling them what flavor profile you want and letting them go to town.  I've never had a bad drink here.  It has taken me quite awhile to get here for the food though.  I ordered the rabbit and my husband got the carbonara.  I really enjoyed the different flavors that were in my dish and they all worked very harmoniously together, but the carbonara was to die for.  I was definitely having dish envy.   The staff is excellent and they definitely have a theme to their decor.  Quite eclectic hipster/hunter I would say.  Very interesting.  Also, if you like Whiskey - this is the place for you.",

    "text": "I was in awe of the interior as we were lead to our table upstairs. I was surprised by how dark the lighting was inside, and there was just enough light for our late thirties eyes to read the menus. I will admit it was a bit fun trying to hold the lit candle up to the menus trying to make our drink selections we were so excited for. The antler chandelier we were seated next to, and the wall of spirits as you walk in were showstoppers as well.  Appetizers  She drank: Morning Glory (Bulleit Rye / Hennessy VS / Cointreau / Absinthe / Angostura Bitters / Sparkling Wine) He drank: Salingers Sling (Bulleit Bourbon / Grand Marnier / Demerara / Coffee Bitters) We ate: Rustic Bread - pan gravy / lard / black pepper / sage, and Brussels - brown butter / dill / parmigiano reggiano / preserved lemon aioli.  We started the evening with some drinks and appetizers, which were so good, SO good. If you ever go, get the brussel sprouts. The crunchy, roasted brussel sprouts most definitely should be enjoyed with the aioli. The lemon aoli cuts the saltiness of the prepared brussels (try by themselves if you like), and makes them taste divine. The rustic bread and pan gray reminded me of Thanksgiving or what I imagine a homey Sunday dinner to be. Everything was seasoned just right when enjoyed with the other items on the plate.  Main Course  She drank: Bee's Knees  (Hendrick's Gin / Lemon / Honey) He drank: Blackthorn (The Irishman's Founder's Reserve / Sweet Vermouth / Angostura Bitters / Copper & King's Absinthe) We ate: Seared Scallops served over blue crab risotto with asparagus, chanterelles, and capers. Hanger Steak with charred spring onion, potato croquettes, asparagus, green garlic, and red wine jus.  I really enjoyed the Bee's Knees, but I wish I had started with this drink. It was a bit too sweet for the scallops and risotto, but the lemon did lightly compliment the seafood. In retrospect, I think the Morning Glory would have been a better pairing.  The risotto topped with seared scallops was so insanely delicious and expertly cooked I am still...STILL thinking about it months later. The asparagus and chanterelles added a very pleasing taste as well as nice contrasting texture to the risotto and scallops.  The hanger steak entree was equally well executed in taste and textures, but I think we were all still thinking of those scallops.  We could not leave without at least trying a dessert.  Dessert (At the time of our meal, this item was an option)  She drank: Water (I did have a sip from his drink...) He drank: Kentucky Coffee Tree (Bulleit Rye / Mezcal Joven / Stumptown Cold Brew Syrup / Chocolate Bitters) We ate: S'mores (bourbon marshmallow / chocolate rope / brown butter fried ice cream / graham cracker soil  I really enjoyed the ice cream in the dessert, but there was some pieces of chocolate on the plate that straight up reminded me of astronaut ice cream. (Astronaut ice cream is a novelty, not very tasty.) I think this was our least favorite menu item.",

Not to my surprise, the wait was about an hour for a table - but there was bar seating which was fine by me. It was very dimly lit, but the bar was lit behind the bottles - which looked really cool and there was a library ladder attached to the bar which was a nice touch.  We started off with cocktails - I wish I could remember the name, it was one of their punch specials and it was light, refreshing and not overly sweet! Anyway onto the food - when you can't decide what you want, you order it all! My friend and I ordered Mac N Cheese, Cauliflower, Pig Candy and Shishito Peppers. Each bite was better than the last! The cauliflower really stood out and the mix of farro was a great addition to the plate.  My belly was very happy that we made it here while on my trip to Pittsburgh!",

Brussel sprout appetizer lived up to the 'hype' and the steak tartare was plentiful and delicious. We ordered the large scallop plate to split as an entree,  although delicious and prepared superbly, we were super disappointed in the portion size. Did the waitress drop a few on the way to the table? I reminded her that we ordered the 'large' portion as there were only 3 scallops on the plate sitting upon a scarce portion of risotto. She promptly stated that this was indeed the 'large' portion. Of course I inquired how many scallops came on the small plate-drumroll....\"ONE\"! 33 dollars for 3 scallops?! Ouch! I don't mind paying for excellent fare, but my butt STILL hurts from that one. Which brings me to the ladies room-for the love of god please get rid of the swinging, saloon, stall doors. Broken slats and a gap between the doors for the rest of the ladies in waiting to view my 'business'-gauche, to say the least. One would think that with all the scallop revenue this place is making they could afford bathroom doors. Oh, I almost forgot-sticky,toffee, pudding for dessert, meh, I could take it or leave it. Will I be back? \"Yes\", I will be sitting at the bar for a delicious cocktail and brussel sprouts.",

    "text": "After having gone to Meat & Potatoes a couple of times, I decided to give Butcher & the Rye a go and really glad that I did. In fact, I think I prefer it to M&P, even though they share owners.  They have a couple of tables set up outside on the sidewalk, and I got to sit out there during one of the nicer days in late May. The service right off the bat was great: the host was really friendly, as was the waitress, and incredibly helpful in deciding what to order. In the end I decided on the brown butter brussels (sprouts) and the soft shell crab that was on special that day. Both items were INCREDIBLE! I thought that the brussels I had at Emporio were good, but those at B&tR were far less salty, so they take the lead. And the soft shell crab was amazing, with just the hint of a kick. Bonus points to B&tR for having delicious non-alcoholic drinks that weren't your usual sodas/juices.",

    "text": "Yelp researched the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and Butcher and the Rye was on the top of the list. With 4.5 stars and over 600 reviews, I knew I had to give them a try during my 3 day stay. Added Yelp bonus: Their reservation system is through Yelp, woo!   AMBIANCE: Low lighting, mounted animals, and antler chandeliers.... oh my!   SERVICE: We arrived a little early and our table \"wasn't quite ready yet\". No problem, there are multiple Pokestops nearby to hit up (judge me). Our waiter (dangit, I forgot his name) was great! Very friendly and personable and checked on us frequently. We made it halfway through our entrees when we got a phone call from our hotel for a noise complaint on our dogs. Unfortunately, we had to cut our dining experience short and our waiter speedily boxed our leftovers and expedited the bill process. We definitely appreciated this!   FOOD: Winner, winner, duck dinner! Omg, the Dirty Pasta was sooooo good. We perused other Yelper's pictures that captioned the Dirty Pasta as \"their last meal on Earth\"... I'm thinking \"yeah, right, stop, so dramatic\". Um, yeah, no... SERIOUSLY SO GOOD. Salty, slightly sweet, herbaceous, meaty, cheesy. DO IT! The brussels are also really good, very charred and covered in parmigiano reggiano. I've never had brussels with dill and it was definitely a unique twist.   DRANKS: Kentucky Tea Party Punch was visually stunning and equally tasty. The cup was beautifully topped with a mint garnish and paired great with the Pimms and Jim. If you're interested to know what a hellfire shrub tastes like, then order the Wild Kind. I'm sure one could guess, but do it. I dare you.   Overall, great meal, great time, wish we could have stayed longer! So sad I missed out on the Bramble cocktail and Peaches n' Cream Doughnuts :( :( :( :( :(",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to coming here for a few years now but haven't been able to whenever I've been in town. I finally came here to celebrate Valentine's Day with my gf on the Friday afterwards. It was surprisingly difficult to get a reservation but that speaks to its popularity. We ended up getting one for 9:45.   We arrive and got seated up stairs with a view of the downstairs bar, just like I asked, so that was great especially since I've never been there before. We got seated and got some drinks; I had a cask aged Manhattan with old turkey bourbon and my girlfriend had a lemon gin drink (can't exactly remember).   We ordered a cheese plate to start and said we'd order entrees after that. We asked if the kitchen was open for a while since this was out first time there and the waitress said: \"Yeah, you're in the city, we stay open late.\" We weren't sure being that it was our first time there. I got the vibe that she acted like we were from the burbs but far from it, we live in New York City.   We ordered entrees after our app was finished. My gf got scallops and I had a short rib entree. The weird part was that our waitress didn't come back to see if we wanted another round. She was dealing with a lot of questions from the table next to us but didn't turn around to ask anything after taking their order nor in the next 15 minutes when dripping off their drinks. Our app was cleared a few moments later but they didn't bring new utensils. A few minutes later our food arrives and I'm utensil-less. I waited 2-3 minutes, the entire time looking toward her distinctly behind the bar, before walking up to the bar, to ask her for new utensils. She looked aghast. I said \"hey we need new utensils and would like to order another drink.\" She said she would be over in a moment. When she comes over I proceed to order another drink but I had a question about one of the cask whiskeys like I had order before. She gave me some sort of attitude about how they have tons of cask asked stuff and would have to get another menu. At that point I said its ok and just order another bourbon, Evan Williams, that is a go to for me. It was awkward from that point onwards.   I'd hope this was a one off and I'd go back but I definitely would have expected more from an upscale place. It soured my expectations for coming here. New utensils are a requisite and a little more attention at the least. When I have to request your attention after going 15+ minutes without so much as a glare then that's a problem.",

The atmosphere is very hipster, with deer antlers, mirrors, and unique lighting everywhere. However, the service I've received here is timeless. Jenna is a fantastic waitress!  When Jenna suggested the Sunday Gravy appetizer, I didn't expect much. It looks like a sauce you just throw on bread. GET IT! Whenever someone mentions Butcher and the Rye, the first image that pops into my head is that Sunday Gravy. I tell anyone I meet that asks about restaurants to go there and to order that.   As an entree, I've ordered the dirty pasta multiple times. The sizing of the dish has varied--never too small! But sometimes it's a just right portion and other times it looks enormous! As a fan of leftovers, this doesn't bother me.  Go to Butcher and the Rye, you wont regret it! Just leave space for me to be able to squeeze in my next reservation as well!",

I made the first available on a friday night and they confirmed the reservation the day before. I walked in and didn't even have to wait!  As soon as i walked in, I was amazed at the atmosphere. It was swanky and sexy. I ended up sitting in the second floor area. Only complaint is that it is a little crowded but hey at least I was able to peruse the other patrons meals as I waited for mine.   Our server was a great. She was acknowledgeable on all the drinks and entrees. I was pleased with all the things that I did order. We got a few of the regular menu items and some from the specials menu.  Ordered the crispy octopus, the tortellini, strip steak, marrow, and the beet salad. The only thing that I didn't really care for was the tortellini but everything else was tasty and well plated.   Our waitress was great with food/drink recommendations and they brought out all the dishes in a very perfunctory manner so that nothing overlapped.   Service was as swanky as the eclectic vibe in the place. Wish I had more time to sit at the bar and people watch!!",

At first when we got there, it seemed really loud and we couldn't hear each other very well, especially with 2 other couples right next to us. We adjusted quickly and ended up not minding the seating.  The cocktails were delicious. My favorite was the Blackthorn, which tasted heavily of absinthe to me, but I love absinthe so it works out, but they were all delicious. I'd definitely want to go  We started with the brussels sprouts, which were amazing. Nice and crisp, with a lot of Parmesan cheese. My boyfriend got the pork and lobster sugo, which was tasty. I only had a bite, but he thought that the pork was nice and tender and flavorful. I got the scallops with risotto, which was perfect. The scallops were so well done and I loved the risotto with mushrooms.   I loved the food here and definitely would go back. It's a little dark and really loud and chaotic, but I loved the decor and the food and drinks make it 100% worth checking out.",

The cocktails are on point.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The service is phenomenal. My one request would be that our server doesn't ask us if we want cocktails *every* time he visits. Sometimes it's nice just to get checked up on. He was wonderful nonetheless, and it was great to know someone wanted to make sure we were getting delicious drinks when we wanted them!  I recommend requesting reservations upstairs at the Rye Bar.  Thanks for being so awesome, Butcher!",

    "text": "After hearing great things about Butcher and the Rye, my friend made a reservation for us a few Friday nights ago.  We had reservations for 5 PM on a Friday night when there was a baseball game.  So while parking was a problem, we got a day of reservation with no issues.    As I had sat through meetings at many coffee shops that day, I just couldn't order a drink.  This was a total bummer, but there are plenty of alcoholic options if you are interested in a drink.  To begin we started with the crispy Pig Wing ($9) and Sunday Gravy ($10).  I loved both appetizers.  The pig wing was surrounded with thai chili sauce, pickled mango salad, peanuts, and cilantro.  The Sunday Gravy was heated tomatoes, lamb neck, olive oil, and ricotta served with grilled bread.  The Sunday Gravy was a significantly larger portion, but I couldn't pick a favorite appetizer if I had to!  For an entree, I ordered the Dirty Pasta ($16), and my friend ordered the Shepherd's pie ($20).  The Dirty Pasta was SPECTACULAR, and it is strozzapretti tossed in ground duck, sage, brandy, and pecorino Romano.  I would 100% recommend this dish.  It is absolute perfection and beyond words.  The Shepherd's Pie was a bit strange.  The braised beef was wonderful, but it was mostly vegetables and there was no crust.  It wasn't bad, just not what we expected.  I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  The main level is a bit farm-y, and the second level is very wildlife oriented.  I really liked the atmosphere of the second level, and it would be great for a more intimate evening.  Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, the bathrooms are awkward.  Just awkward.  It is a rarity that I go anywhere without checking out Yelp before I go so I didn't realize this was the sister restaurant of Meat and Potatoes.  This makes total sense.  I will absoltely come back to Butcher and the Rye.",

We ordered the pig wing, brussels (way too salty but still good), cauliflower and the mac and cheese. I also had the Jack Rose from the drink menu.  All were delicious.

The risotto was cooked perfectly & the scallops melted in your mouth. We tried Steak Tartare for the first time and it was delicious. We finished with the Truffle Polenta.  It was rich and a lot more subtle in flavor than the other dishes, yet pleasant on the palate. Although the decor is a fun modern twist on the American old west, the choice of music & the uncomfortably warm temperature of the restaurant could use improvement. These two reasons are why we gave it four stars, otherwise it would have received five. We will definitely be back!",

Creative and on-point cocktails (I had the Wild Kind -bourbon, smoked honey, Thai chili oil), dim and sort of prohibition era-meets-hunting lodge atmosphere, and the food was truly indulgent. The bone marrow is a must, and the saffron mussel soup, duck liver pate, tartare with truffle egg, and dirty pasta with duck are also incredible. If you are looking for a classy place for a nice dinner in a Pittsburgh, this should be a top contender. They also have a lounge area upstairs which looked intimate and might not have as long of a wait as a regular table.",

Drinks: If the third floor has space - go up there and ask for Cecil.  Not kidding.  He's a magician.  Everything on the menu is creative, but they can make you just about anything.  Food:  Get the Cauliflower, sprouts, mac and cheese, any of the fishes....really I havent had a bad meal there.  The hanger steak is great too (get it rare-medium).

    "text": "Up until recently, I had only been to Butcher and the Rye twice for post-workday cocktails. I have tried a few of them, and they have all been interesting and well-crafted. I knew I needed to return here for dinner, and was very excited when I finally made plans to do so during restaurant week.  I'm usually all about the prix fixe restaurant week menus (since they are usually unique and only offered for a limited time), but the regular menu had so many appetizing options that we decided to go our own route.   We started with the focaccia. The bread was delicious and I'm not exaggerating when I say I could have probably eaten an entire loaf of it by myself. It was accompanied by three spreads: a white bean puree, olive tapenade, and whipped ricotta. All three were delicious, and the servings were generous with a good bread-to-spread ratio.  We followed this with the dry aged tartare. I loved that the tartare was served on very thin pieces of bread, garnished with capers, radish, black garlic aioli, greens, and of course an egg yolk. It was visually a very appealing dish, and the flavor did not disappoint. I will mirror what my dining partner Ashley L. said: this was the best tartare I've had so far by a long shot.  I enjoyed the seared scallops for my entree. They were served on a blue crab risotto with chanterelles (and yet more capers--I clearly love them). The scallops were packed with flavor and perfectly succulent. Risotto is often hit or miss but this was delicious and the perfect texture. The portion was a good size and again looked just as good as it tasted.  The service has been great here, both at the bar and this time while dining. Everyone has been friendly and informative. The space itself is fantastic... the restaurant is divided into small areas (and an upstairs balcony), and with the low lighting and rustic finishes, has a very intimate yet comfortable atmosphere. I love the mismatched furniture and unique decor. They really did a great job at making the place feel and look upscale without being stuffy.  I'm already looking forward to my next trip here as there are a number of other items on the menu that sounded fantastic!",

    "text": "I love the look of this place, with its sort of Boardwalk Empire meets Downton Abbey meets modern day PIttsburgh vibe. And the menu reads very well, with interesting and innovative choices. It's in the execution of the food where things fall apart. I tried three small plates...the shishito peppers, caesar salad and the pork terrine. The peppers came in a nicely charred pile, but didn't have enough of the sriracha sauce that was minimally painted on the plate. Not bad, just a little ho hum. The caesar had good flavors, but was egregiously over dressed, and was a smallish salad for the price, with more bread than salad. The pork terrine was good...the best thing I had. I've eaten at Meat & Potatoes a couple of times and thought it very good, so they may be spreading themselves too thin by opening this place, with two others soon to follow. They also kept burning the toast for the salad, which everyone seemed to be ordering, and the place was full of smoke halfway through our meal, which never dissipated, so they need a better exhaust system. They spent a lot of time and creativity here on the drink end of things...now they need to get their act together in the kitchen.",

It seems like now that they have a following, they are not trying as hard.  If they think they can get away with just ok food, and not so great service, they won't last long.    There were five of us for dinner on Sayurday night.  For appetizers we got the brussels sprouts, pig wings, mussels, and foccacia.  The sprouts were good but I've had better.  The mussels were also ok, but lacked flavor, and the focaccia was good but standard.  Our dinners were the same.  Good but nothing exceptional.  The macaroni and cheese was really, really bland.  Our server also lacked personality and everything we needed (that she should have brought without asking) seemed to be an effort.  I can understand when they are busy, but it was early on Saturday night and the servers had time to stand around and talk.  I guess our server didn't like having her conversation with the other servers interupted to please a customer.  Drinks were good though.  I enjoyed the whiskey.",

If this restaurant was only a bar it would receive 5 stars, absolutely on par with Bar Marco or other excellent cocktail bars in other cities. We sat at the bar and found the bartenders to be extremely knowledgeable about their extensive whiskey list. However, it is not only a bar. The food we had was overly salty and to be honest the portions were also too large.",

We went on a wedn night at 730 and the place was packed! They had a few wines by the glass and a large assortment of beers. Penn brewery makes a few special beers just for butcher and the rye!  Ask for a sample.   I started with the beet salad, which didn't even need the dressing.  It was excellent!  My fiance had the pig candy which he ate in complete silence bc he was enjoying it so much.  For dinner I had the trout.  It was also excellent.  It comes out as a whole fish, so be prepared.  It was excellently seasoned and had a yummy creamy sauce underneath.  The only thing I didn't like was that the cauliflower was under the fish and hard to get to, but tasted delicious once I got some.  For dessert they had a special s'mores deconstruction that was delicious!  The bourbon marshmallows were amazing!!! Overall the place is loud, but the food is tasty and the staff is wonderful!",

The hostess was very accommodating to our change of plans, and as soon as we walked in, we were seated with menus in hand.  Within a minute of sitting, our server came over to take our drink orders, and when we could not decide he offered us several suggestions, which we heeded and ordered accordingly.  We ordered the Black Dahlia, which is sweet but smoky, and the Salinger's Sling that is an interesting spin on an Old Fashioned- sans fruit, with Grand Marnier and the nice twist of coffee bitters. The drinks were great!  We also ordered the Pig Candy, and although it is a small dish, it was amazingly prepared, and incredibly delicious.  Before our meals arrived we ordered a second round of drinks- Maid's Wonder and Bramble, both had a refreshing appeal about them, especially the Bramble with the Rosemary.  For our entrees, we got the Scallops and Rabbit and Dumplings.  The Scallops were cooked to perfection, and the risotto and capers enhanced and complimented the scallops.  I was hesitant to try the Rabbit and Dumplings, because I am crazy when it comes to eating animals that could be considered pets, but the meal was creamy and delicious and had vegetables to balance it all.  IN SHORT: I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! Great food, great cocktails, great atmosphere.",

    "text": "Went with a group of 7 for a work function. Needed to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance to score a table on a Thursday night. Not a complaint, but more of a heads up to those who want to try Butcher and the Rye Out. Not really the place where you can show up at on a whim and expect to get seated.  We each ordered a different appetizer with the Brussels stealing the show. Cooked perfectly with a cream sauce, they would really make an unreal starter to any dish you paired with them. The pork belly however was overdone and a little bit tough and with the namesake of \"Butcher and the Rye\" I really thought this would be something that would steal the show. Maybe just an off night for the chef, but I was extremely disappointed.   The majority of the table ordered the Scallops with the Risotto and subsequently the majority of the table were extremely happy campers. The risotto was cooked absolutely perfectly, creamy and not too dense. The Scallops were seared to perfection on the outside with the inside remaining tender. A dish that is so easy to mess up seems to be mastered by the chefs at Butcher.   The whiskey wall is something that you need to see first hand, and the service was on par (nothing special, nothing that would ruin my time) with some of the other newer spots around the city. Overall a great spot that i would recommend to anyone looking for a great meal. I will most certainly be going back.",

But this last time we were surprised to hear that they didn't have not just one or two but MANY items listed on their website menu page (which we checked the same day) in the restaurant menu.  It is quite upsetting when restaurants do that. Because when you see something appealing to yourself, that kind of mindsets you on these dishes (particularly if you already had them and want to repeat the experience). When restaurants change the menu frequently some of them say on the web that it's just a sample of what you can see, but not the exect menu of the day. Some post the exect menu at the day of serving it. But at least a patron knows what to expect. I wish this fine establishment also would obtain this habit of clear exposure of changes to their day to day menu on their website. This way patron's frastration with unavailability of the items could be avoidable. Hope they pay attention on patron's thoughts.",

We made reservations a week in advance and upon arrival, we were told our table wasn't ready yet. We waited by the front door since the bar area was already three people deep. At the time, the community tables were empty so not a big deal, there was room to stand. After 15 minutes, we got a txt saying our table was ready which ended up being at the community table next to the front door/bar/hallway to Tako AND it was in between two other couples who were also just sat. You expect me to sit sandwiched between two couples at a picnic table for date night, and still pay a ridiculously high price for our meals?! We were told that if we wanted an actual table, we should have called for a reservation vs going through their website.

The atmosphere is fantastic here - almost makes you forget you're in Pittsburgh and not in some ritzy, hip town like New York City.  My boyfriend and I were sat upstairs at a small table by the bar - which gave us a perfect view of the \"great wall of whiskey\". What was great was that we could still talk and hear each other although the place was quite crowded. When we sat down we were warmly greeted by our cheery waitress and even had the pleasure of talking to the manger, Michael Mills. He was extremely nice to talk to and you could tell he loved his job - which in the restaurant industry, that is sometimes hard to come by and we appreciated the attentiveness.   We got two small plates - the Brussells and the Pig Candy - OMG. Amazing! We had recently went to Tom Colicchio's steakhouse in Las Vegas and got the brussel sprout appetizer and let me tell you, this restaurant was quite comparable! Both of these small plates were out of this world.  For dinner we got the Wagyu Flank Steak and the Seared Scallops. Both were delicious, but not quite as delicious as the small plates we had just eaten.   On the drinks side we both had 2 drinks and left there feeling quite good. The drinks were different than anything I had tasted. I got the Bees Knees (because sadly I am not a whiskey, bourbon, scotch drinker) and it was amazing.",

Cabernet for me, malbec for colleague. We split the brussel sprouts, wow were they deliciously unique. Highly recommend. Also ordered the foccacia bread, which came with 3 different spreads.

I got the Hazel-Rah and Thorny Devil and they were both delicious. Hazel-Rah was like taking a quick tropical vacation. My friend wanted a drink with a smokey Scotch and the bartender made something off the menu that was quite fantastic.  They also had some lovely decor. Their drink shelves are impressive - backlit and brimming with exotic concoctions. They have a ladder to get to the top shelves, which gives you an idea of how many bottles they have.   As some have mentioned, the women's bathroom is a bit odd. The stalls are really low, so you can see into them. I ended up having a good laugh with a stranger in the bathrooms though because we both felt so ridiculous sharing such an intimate moment.

    "text": "I don't usually get drunk. I mean, I get tipsy from two glasses of wine, so it's the very rare occasion when I'll have more than one cocktail. The drinks are so incredible at Butcher and the Rye that I may have had three... Maybe.   This place is super cool. Moody, hip and cool, actually. Immediately upon entering you know it's the place to be. In addition to being moody, hip and cool they happen to make some of the best cocktails in the city so they have the klout to back up their moodiness.   I highly suggest heading up the staircase to the upstairs bar. The dudes behind the bar are master mixers -- they really know what they're doing. I loved seeing them gracefully shift from one drink to the next, chatting away with their customers and always maintaining a polite, kind demeanor without ever missing a joke or a request. They're so talented, I went off menu and put my drink completely in the hands of Jay, who hit it out of the park every single time with his well-balanced and creative cocktails. Hency Hily having three, and Hily getting drunk.   If you're a cocktail person in the mood for something fun, slightly old-school and a little bit different, check out Butcher and the Rye. It's a bar (and the cause of a killer hangover) I'll not soon forget!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now and have concluded that I enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks but am continually unimpressed with the food.  They do make a good sazerac (if it were a smidge less sweet, I would say it's great), a really unique and delicious manhattan, and good punch specials.  I'll definitely have to try a Boulevardier or Vieux Carre the next time I'm here!  At dinner tonight, we split the charcuterie platter, which was fine but (in my opinion) overpriced.  The $12 platter at Cure serves up almost the same variety, and frankly, the charcuterie is better at Cure.  There were two items on this platter that were downright bad, and we didn't even finish them between the four of us.  The pig wing was pretty decent (and one of the better value items, as a small plate). The meat is cooked perfectly, and the sauce is very flavorful -- maybe even too much so, as I found the the sweetness and saltiness to be a bit intense.  However, it's pretty basic -- a sweet, sticky, fish-saucey asian style sauce.  There is nothing much else going on with the dish to write home about.  My friend thought her scallops were delicious, and I agree that the sauce was nice based on what I tried.  Another friend had the ground duck pasta and enjoyed its flavor, although it looked too rich and cheesey for my tastes.  I get that it is supposed to be a rustic dish, but for the price tag I would expect something a little more refined.  My boyfriend had the skirt steak, which I tried.  It was bland and uninventive, and the mini-rice cakes were straight up burnt.  Inedibly burnt.  At a restaurant trying to be at this calibre, this should not happen.  If you are the chef and you burn part of the dish, that dish should not be sent out until the problem is fixed.  Our server was nice, though, and took his cocktail off the bill.  But I would have rather he gotten to have an enjoyable dinner.  They had a very delicious-sounding burger on the menu, but they were sold out of it for the night.  We ordered it at 8pm and the server said it was sold out well before 7pm.  WHAT?  If the servers are so aware of this issue, could the restaurant not arrange to remediate this problem?  Even if it were a matter of limited ingredients... then serve the special on fewer nights.  It is ludicrous to be dining at peak dinner time and be told that the dish you want has repeatedly been sold out by 7pm every night -- apparently in order to dine later than that and get the burger you have to also \"reserve\" the burger when you make your table reservation. Again, WHAT?!  For this kind of hype and $18, it better be one hell of a burger.  Unfortunately, I am not going to go through the trouble to find out.  Finally, I have tried the mussels here during a previous visit and they were not impressive. I also tried to order just a side of bread to dip in the remaining mussel sauce, and they brought me (and charged me for) one of the foccacia-with-dips dishes. Totally not what I had in mind or wanted to pay for, but those dips were pretty tasty at least.  For a place that has experienced so much hype, has been so hard to get a reservation at, and carries such a hefty price tag, I expected *way* better food.  I would give the food 2 stars if you factor in value.  I think the drinks, atmosphere, and service are good and I would for sure come back for just the bar.",

The table was so small and we were sandwiched between two other couples on each side. It was uncomfortable and certainly not what I had intended when setting up a date night for my husband and me.    The appetizers were good, not amazing, but good. We ordered the pig wing and burrata. Not much to say about these really.   My husband ordered the butcher burger. He was unimpressed. I ordered the scallops and blue crab rissoto. The scallops were well cooked but the rissoto was bland.   The plates are rather small, so we had room for dessert. I ordered the flourless chocolate cake and my husband ordered the carrot cake. If you want a cake that doesn't taste like carrots and has a lot of orange flavor - order the carrot cake. If you want a hunk of fudge and not cake - order the flourless chocolate cake.   I will say, the waitress was very nice and the decor was cool. Possibly if you come with more than two people a better dinning experience may be had. The tight seating and small tables were really a hard thing for us to get over.",

So my boyfriend and I appreciate the mixology world and how it's done, we're \"judgy\" about it lol cuz we understand it as well, but wouldn't ruin the persons day if we didn't like something ya know. Lol but those cocktails were great! Perfect to taste!Very neatly done! We were so happy! Our waiter was very kind and  knew what he was talking about, and he was really cool. We didn't get to order food but you could smell it, and it was mouth watering , home kitchen smells!! Lol I'm so happy this place is in Pittsburgh and we live less than 2 hours away! Thanks Butcher and the Rye! You definitely lived up to the expectations and great reputation!! ! And the service was fabulous!! GO HERE !",

The fried brussels will change your life, and the Moscow mules are one of the best I've found in the Burgh. If you're a whiskey drinker though, this place is surely for you.

    "text": "Stopped by for dinner on a Friday night, and was glad I had made a reservation. It was very busy, and we were advised to wait at the bar until our table was ready. The wait was only about 10 minutes. I ordered a Boulevardier, which was promptly prepared by a very enthusiastic bartender who corrected my French.   The ambiance was loud and dark, and I did not care for the music (mostly rap). The decor had a victorian-gothic theme, which didn't fit with the music at all. Overall the atmosphere was too \"bro\" for my liking.  We were soon shown our table which was on the second floor by a balcony that allowed us to look down at the bar, which was pretty neat. But the seats were very low compared to the table, making us feel very short, and it was hard to have a conversation over the music and noise. Our server was very polite and helpful, and the services was pretty quick considering how busy it was. To start, we ordered a charcuterie plate and some fresh sourdough bread with lardo (whipped pork fat) and gravy. The best thing was the bread and lardo, which was like butter but better and had salt, herbs, and spices in it. The charcuterie plate was mostly good, though greasy, but perhaps not worth the $20 it went for. As for main dishes, I ordered the rabbit coq-au-vin, and my husband got the hangar steak. Both of these were tasty for the first few bites, until we realized how salty they were. I could not finish my dish even though I was hungry, because of the amount of salt used. Best part of the main dishes: the broccoli that came with my husband's steak. I was surprised to find what looked like rabbit hearts in my coq-au-vin, which I could have done without.   Overall, I was disappointed by the food, happy with the service, and put off by the ambiance. I really wanted to enjoy this place, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations.",

I would book another trip to Pittsburgh specifically for more of this. I've never had marrow like this before. It was so smooth, and it was paired with toast and candied oxtail or something (there isn't enough toast or oxtail to go with the marrow, and they charge you for more of both toast and oxtail, FYI). I've had marrow at high-end places before, and thought I didn't like it, but this marrow just wasn't in the same category as what I've had in the past. 3. Brussels - eh, I wouldn't order this again. This was drowning in salty sauce.  4. Pig candy - this would have been the best dish we had, if we hadn't gotten the marrow. This was really really great; the fat on top of the pork melts in your mouth.  5. Dry aged tartare - honestly, I barely remember this, but I think this would also be categorized as great 6. Cauliflower - pass. Again, drowning in sauce. I think this is the one dish we didn't finish.   One thing to note is that our table was on the second floor up a spiral staircase, and I didn't see an elevator.

    "text": "By far one of the best meals I have had. If I wasn't with coworkers I would have licked my plates clean, unfortunately I had to leave a little of my sauces on the plate. The small plates menu here has many options. We couldn't decided so ended up ordering three. Siracha spiced roasted shishito peppers, buttery crisp brussel sprouts with dill and parmesan and roasted cauliflower with farro and Harissa yogurt.  The peppers had just the right char to it and just the right amount of spice.  The miso salt added just the right punch to the dish.  If you have not tried dill with brussel sprouts then I highly recommend it. It changes the whole dish somehow the lemony anise flavor along with Parmesan works really well. After eating the farro here I am going to start mixing yogurt with Harissa sauce and using it to dress my grains. The tang from the yogurt hits you just as the spice from Harissa attacks. It's like a war of spices in your mouth and believe me a very happy war. For my entree I had roasted chicken with shiitake and roasted grapes. The chicken was juicy, when eaten with shiitake and grapes the sweet salty and briny flavors worked well together.  Finished off with lemon meringue pie with matcha ice cream, hibiscus dust and fruit caviar. To explain how this tasted would make me want to fly there right now. Highly recommended if you are in the Pittsburg area. I did think about stealing one of their aprons while there but I decided I would want to come back to this restaurant and be banned. Thank you for such a memorable dinner!",
