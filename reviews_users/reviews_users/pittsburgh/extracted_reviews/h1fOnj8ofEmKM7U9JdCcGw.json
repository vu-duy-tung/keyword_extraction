Being a big fan of Biryani, I order it quite frequently and it isn't the best in Pittsburgh. Their mango lassi is top notch, chicken samosas, lamb vindaloo, chicken chilly are decent, my personal favorite would be the lamb curry. Slightly over priced but, they seem to be the only Indian food place that delivers to South Side in Pitt. I would rate it a 3.5 if yelp allowed it. If you live in South Side and crave some good old Indian cuisine when its too cold to step out (make sure you tip good :P ) or when you're too lazy to cook, Prince of India is the place to call.",

I ordered a Lamb Biryani and it looked like they put lamb chunks in lemon rice. The Aloo Paratha which is one of the easiest things to make did not have aloo stuffing as much as you would like. Very disappointed with their food. I am never ordering from this place again. Just wasted my $20 bucks for nothing.",

It seems like it always takes about 15 minutes for me to order over the phone but it's definitely well worth it.  Portions are huge when you order for delivery so you will definitely have something to look forward to when it comes to left overs.   My go to when it comes to Indian food is the vegetable Korma. They do a pretty solid Korma but it's definitely not as good as taste of India in Bloomfield.   Either way if your looking for Indian and want delivery call prince of India :)",

The selection isn't large, but it's good--there's a small salad bar, galub jamun, naan, rice, and about six entree-style options. The food is good.  However, the person at the register seemed annoyed at me when I asked about their Restaurant Week special and when I paid. He left before I handed him the signed receipt and told me to leave it on the counter, which I didn't feel very comfortable doing. The second time I went, I was charged full price until I asked about the Restaurant Week special. I guess this is understandable, but I didn't feel comfortable paying for my food. However, this place is the closest Indian restaurant to where I live, so I'll probably be back when I'm craving some.",

While all restaurants have an incentive to skimp on more expensive ingredients, the extent to which Prince of India holds back on key ingredients is insulting to diners and destroys what seems like a good value.  The menu boasts excellent variety, but a non-vegetarian thali with lamb curry came with only five tiny pieces of lamb (the sum of which would be 2 pieces at many competitors), and the tandoori mixed grill--which the menu says includes chicken, lamb, and shrimp--came with but a single shrimp of unimpressive size.  The food isn't bad, but it's hard not to leave feeling like you got a little ripped off.  If I return, it will only be for the buffet.",

The night we went here for dinner, there were 10 or 11 small children actually running around in circles in the restaurant because apparently monsters were hiding under the tables. This was probably an unusual situation since there was a large group of adults having some sort of a get together and they had all brought their children, however I still think it was cool that the restaurant was willing to allow the children to run around. If you're bothered by noise and screaming children, this might not be the place for you (although as mentioned above it probably doesn't happen that often). However, if you have small children and don't want to have to worry about them running around, it might be a good spot for you.  Food wise, it was fairly unremarkable - just your standard Indian food. Not particularly good, but not bad either.",

There were plenty of dishes along with salads, rice, and dessert. Fountain drinks and chai tea (you can choose to have it with or without sugar) were also included in the lunch buffet.

I thought that was a great deal.  We made our way into Oakland and the restaurant was located on 5thA just across from the hospitals. When we entered there was only one waiter serving everyone and seating. We had to wait for nearly 10 minutes while he took the orders of other guests before we were seated.   Our table was comfortable but a little worn out. The groupon didn't apply to the buffet so we just ate off the menu. We ordered a samosa and channa chat. The channa chat was a chick pea dish, served chilled and the samosa was deep fried, hot and delicious!! The channa was just as good, it packed a lot of flavor and was served with onions and green peppers. For our main entree we order chicken tiki masala and lamb mango curry. For some reason i thought my chicken was going to be a wet dish but i was rather dry. The chicken skin was a little tough and dry although the meat was very moist and tasted like it had been grilled.  My hubby's dish was a lot better than mine but it was very spicy. He ordered a 6 spicy level but it was more like a 9. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get much lamb in the dish and the sauce wasn't plentiful either. For $13.99 I figured the would get a little more curry. The groupon was good in this regard that i didn't pay full price for my food. Overall I mostly enjoyed the appetizer and onion naan bread.",

So we arrived at the restaurant at around 7:30pm, which we expected to be at it's busiest time of the week, and walked in to find one waitstaff, and two tables with patrons eating at them.  We approached the buffet to find a single table with about 8 hot entrees, all of them looking dry and unappealing.    I tried the chicken curry, the chicken tikka masala, and some rice.  The chicken was dry, and cubed and tasted like it was fresh out the can about four hours under a lamp.  The rice was so dried out, that it was almost hard.  The Chicken Biryani was so disgusting that I spit it out.  Our dirty plates sat on the table during the entire meal, not picked up by the waiter, who seemed too busy in the back to be tending to his tables. Upset and displeased, we left our table after ten minutes sitting there, and stood at the counter, because he never came out to give us a check.  After a few minutes, he noticed us standing there to pay and came to the counter, then bombarded by everyone else in the restaurant to pay while the waiter was out and paying attention to his patrons.    I can assure you that I'm no indian food expert, but I also know that's not how to run a restaurant.  It's no surprise that the restaurant was dead at prime time on a friday night in the middle of a college town.  I can promise you, I will never spend another dollar in that restaurant again.  Gordon Ramsay would have went apeshit.",

    "text": "Decided to stop by for lunch with a buddy.  In terms of being a celiac.... this place may raise your anxiety, but in return you'll be able to try some tasty food.  So, my encounter started a bit poorly with a small language barrier with the waiter.  Basically, I tried to explain that i was gluten free, which somehow turned into him thinking I wanted my food for free and that I was a student.  I will say he did cheerfully address my perceived questions, even if the explanations made no sense in terms of my actual questions.  Before we both became overtly frustrated I asked to speak to someone else, which resulted in me speaking to the chef.  The chef said \" everything is gluten free, \" and then rolled back to the kitchen.  So, like many in the celiac community, this made me rather uncomfortable as clearly there were items containing wheat ( the naan).  Anyway, I was with a buddy and decided to be brave for once ( while still picking a relatively safe menu item).  I chose the chicken tikka.  Though the waiter did offer me naan with it (which i declined), and growing anxiety I did try the dish.  The chicken tikka was in a thicker sauce (looked like it might have been reheated, but no judgment) than I'm used to and I had approximately five chunks of chicken in total in the dish... The rice was well cooked and when paired with the sauce it made an addictive combination.  The chicken chunks were rather large, moist, and shredded well.  Best of all, to my delight the chef was correct.  No contamination issues and i'd vouch for the gluten free nature of the chicken tikka.  In review, if you are gluten free and feeling brave you might want to try Prince of India.  If you aren't gluten free... well the buffet looked really nice and as I was informed by my buddy it was pretty tasty.",

    "text": "This is one of the worst Indian food I've had in a while. I went there for the dinner buffet and started with the appetizers. The pakoras were too dry. They had no taste in them. The chicken biryani was basically uncooked rice with small pieces of unsavory chicken. And the Tandoori chicken had an unusual smell to it.   Coming to the main course: The chicken tikka masala had a rubber-like texture. The saag and the malai kofta, even though had rich gravy, had practically the same taste (too buttery). The chicken curry was good.  The only thing I really liked about the food was the dessert. They had mango ice cream, kheer and gulab jamun.   Conclusion: If you guys want to taste authentic Indian food, avoid this place! This will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It does not justify the $12 ($10 on student ID) price tag. I would not go there again. Also, my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts.",

The only vegan options in the buffet were chana masala and dal. While not abysmal, the meal was decidedly forgettable, and I was frustrated to discover my discount was not applicable to the buffet as it meant a return trip would be necessitated.  As it turned out, the second time was definitely the charm. My girlfriend and I were thoroughly impressed by our (modified non-dairy version of) the mouth-watering veg thali with its aromatic fresh vegetables, savory legumes, flaky samosa, and crisp but tender roti. The meal left us with satisfied bellies, and when the chef emerged from the kitchen, we couldn't help but give him two big thumbs up. Wowza! This is one \"prince\" that ought to be king - of the Pittsburgh culinary scene, at least!",

Food is half price most hours of the day (good lunch buffet option, and actual half price entrees except for between the hours of 6-7 pm), but I would recommend take-out--you'll pay full price no matter the time but the portions are good for 2-3 meals and you don't have to deal with the slow service. My go to is the chicken tikka masala or the chicken makhini, but the Chana masala and samosas are also great!",

    "text": "I live a block away from Prince so I eat here frequently, but that's more a matter of convenience and price over taste.  I usually opt for the dinner buffet, as it includes made to order naan at a fairly low price ($9 for eat in and $7 for takeout). The food at the buffet is hit or miss. The chicken tikka masala is acceptable but too creamy, and the chicken can be dry. Their tandoori chicken is great compared to other Oakland Indian spots, and the chicken curry is a bit bland but the chunks of dark meat chicken are tender and juicy.  Vegetable entrees usually fare better than the meats. Chana (chickpeas) are meaty and hearty, the rajma (kidney beans) is spicy and bold, and most other vegetable offerings are decent albeit a bit greasy.  Fresh naan is the best part of the meal, it's soft with a decent amount of char for a texturally rich bite. Don't order off the menu, the food isn't a big step up from the buffet and is overpriced (unless you get the tandoori meats, which are prepared quite well). Go to India Garden, Star of India, or Tamarind instead for a la carte.  The dining room is surprisingly quiet yet very dimly lit, probably to save money on electric bills. Hindi music videos play on the TV, and they have a fridge appropriately stocked with Four Loko.  In summary, go for cheap prices and middle of the road Indian food. Other Oakland Indian joints may do slightly better food, but not at such a great price.",

The items we had:  Matar Paneer: cheese cubes in an incredible tomato-cream sauce with grean peas. I'm not even a fan of peas and I loved this! It was just the right mix of spicy and rich. Chana Masala: stewed chickpeas that were spicier than I was expecting, but also really good. Palak Aloo: It's usually hit or miss with me with Indian spinach dishes - this was the weakest of the three, as it was the least flavorful.  The naan is the perfect level of chewiness, even after time in transit - that made me so happy! All in all very good, will probably hit up the buffet sometime in the near future.",

My most recent experience definitely made me want to write a review because I had such an attentive server.   I ordered the lentil daal in an attempt to try something new (I usually order mattar paneer or saag), with the spiciest spice level they could do. That's usually what I tell them, too, because if I say 10, they'll give me \"white girl 10\", which is still too mild for my taste.  When the lentil daal came out, it was still not hot enough! I don't know if it was the texture of the lentils or the flavors in the dish, but I was regretting not ordering my usual. However, I guess the waiter picked up that it wasn't spicy enough. He said, \"How is the spice level?\" and I said, \"Still not hot enough, but that's okay!\" However he wasn't going to take that as an answer. He took my dish and brought back a hotter dish. The spice level was much more to my liking, and I am very thankful for his attentiveness.   Aside from the daal, the naan was not nearly as fluffy and soft as it usually is. I would venture to guess there was too much flour in the dough, but it was inconsistent with my previous experiences eating Prince of India's naan, which is almost always light and fluffy.   All in all, I will definitely be going back to Prince of India. Mostly due to convenience.  Tip: order an individual dish, don't go for the buffet. It always tastes less delicious than the entrees.",

But for that price you can't really expect more.   Other food: I always order chicken tikka masala-- it's a MUST! It is the best tasting curry I had in Pittsburgh, or ever! It is spicy and creamy at the same time... I don't really know how to explain it but you have to try it!   I always order plain naans with it. I've also tried out other curry but to me nothing taste better than chicken tikka masala. I don't like the rice at all but I guess it's caused by cultural difference rather than bad cooking. My friend has no problem with it.  Service: The waiters are very polite and friendly. I rarely have to ask for more water, and when you are eating Indian curry, not having water is the last thing you want. After going there a couple of times, one of the waiters remembered me and would give me and my friend a cup of soda every time we go there. I've never had any issue with the waiters there. They have very good manners.   Environment: The restaurant is very clean and well organized. I also like the Indian music they always play in the background. The restaurant is comparatively quiet.  All in all, this is a really nice restaurant especially considering their price is a fraction of other Indian restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. I've been eating here for about 4 years and the experience had always been very enjoyable. Now that I moved to LA, I really miss this place.",

The portion was so large that I couldn't really get to the samosa chaat.  However, I still managed to taste it.  The samosa chaat was not as high in my ratings.  I'm used to a cold chaat, or at least that's what I prefer.  The few times I've had it warm the yogurt was visible.  I'm not sure if the yogurt was mixed in or just absolutely missing.

Last dinner buffet I had there included very good chicken tikka masala, saag, tandoori chicken, excellent chili chicken, turnip masala, vegetable korma, and channa masala, plus a small salad and dessert bar. Rice also, of course. You also get unlimited self serve soft drinks included in the price. At lunch, there is naan on the buffet, but at dinner you get fresh naan of your choice, which is a delicious upgrade.  The buffet food is always good, but could be a bit more aggressively spiced. I understand why buffets are never spiced \"hot,\" but some dishes here could just use more flavor.  I have had a la carte several times, and it's excellent. However, as with other Indian restaurants, the portions are really small for the price, so I tend to stick to the buffet.  UPMC and student discounts, too.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant with a friend for lunch a week ago.  We were having an informal lunch meeting to talk about some business, so I suggested this place and a couple of others that were convenient for both of us.  She chose Prince of India, so we both met up here around noon.  Technically, I'd been once before, but I hadn't actually eaten anything here because I'd already had dinner, so I count this as being my first time.  The food is your typical Indian buffet fare, including chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, saag, pita bread, navratan korma, and rice on the hot bar, and several vegetables and sauces on the cold bar.  I picked up some of all of the aforementioned dishes, plus some cucumber yogurt sauce from the cold bar.  I found the food pretty average in quality for Indian buffet food--not great, but not horrible, either.  Because I wasn't terribly impressed, I stuck with one plate, and didn't go for seconds.  At the time of our visit, the dining room was pretty quiet, so it was a good place to have a business lunch.  (Indeed, I spotted one of my supervisors in the row of tables on the other side talking to a colleague...)  The decor is pretty nondescript for an Indian restaurant, with one TV playing Bollywood music videos in the back.  If you study or work at Pitt or UPMC, be sure to bring your ID to take advantage of the $1 discount.  The lunch buffet price is $9, which is pretty average for the area.  Given the average food, average decor, average prices, and even average service, the main thing this place has going for it is convenience for those who work in Oakland.  If you're able to do so, I'd recommend walking down Atwood or over to Craig to check out the superior Indian offerings there.  However, if you need a quiet, uncrowded place for lunch and don't want to walk any further than Fifth Ave., Prince of India will do just fine.",

    "text": "I've been to the buffet a few times and the food is all right. Their rice on the buffet ends up really dry. It could be just cooked wrong, or else it's been on the buffet way too long. It's a smaller buffet, so options are limited. It's not the best Indian buffet in the area, but it's really cheap and close to Pitt and UPMC, so it's convenient, and they have a discount with ID. It's always really dim there though, and the booths are not very comfortable, a lot of the seats sink in awkwardly. I've never seen is crowded, so it seems the general consensus is that it's not great. The staff is sometimes on the phone making personal calls when you're trying to pay, which is frustrating.  We ordered delivery from there through Grubhub last night at 7:40pm. The food was supposed to arrive around 9:00. We called them, and they said they never got the fax from Grubhub, but then conveniently received it when on the phone with us. They said they'd send the food out. We called again around 10 since the food hadn't arrived still, but they were closed so nobody answered. Then we had to call Grubhub, who said the problem was not on their end and that the fax was received. They talked to the delivery person who said that he was on the way. Finally 5 minutes later the food came, but the delivery guy said he couldn't get up the hill because of snow and asked us to come down. When we brought the food in, the one thing was wrong, which meant our vegetarian friend didn't even have anything she could eat.   The rice in our order was super dry, almost crunchy, like they just packaged up whatever was left on the buffet. The naan was good. I liked my saag. I tried someone else's chicken vindaloo and it was good, but not spicy at all.   I'm not sure what actually happened with the fax, but it's really convenient that they got the fax exactly when we were on the phone with them. The order was messed up with no way to fix it so late at night, so one person didn't even get to eat.",

Anyway I am a bit picky about India food because I really am not a fan of spicy food. However, I was not disappointed.  We parked a couple of blocks as this establishment does not have parking. Since we came in on a Sunday evening it was a little empty when we arrived. We were immediately seated in the table of our choice and provided waters right away.   Ordered samosas which were pretty tasty for appetizers. For the entree I opted for lamb saag, with no spice. My husband when for the chicken mango curry. I will say that the saag was not spicy and I was able to enjoy it, which is something that is hard to find and the main reason that I dont go to Indian restaurants that frequently. My husbands had a bit of a kick but was quite flavorful. We were provided with some delicious garlic naan and a large helping of rice which was refilled upon request.   In addition to the food, I ordered some mango lassis which were outstanding.   Anyway overall the decor is nothing to write home about, but the food and the service are definitely on point and would def check them out again if I am in the area.",

    "text": "Why do they not have a proper Indian sit down restaurant in the South Side? We have more than a few Thai and Taco, even a Colombian, Spanish and Lebanese place, so I know the neighborhood can support food diversity, but not one dang Indian restaurant which I know would be a hit.   In the meantime, while I wait, Prince of India is one of a few Indian restaurants that deliver to the South Side, where I live and work. I had a long day at work  scheduled so I ordered lunch from there for my coworker and me thru Grubhub. They have a two chicken dish combo with rice and plain naan I have been ordering to keep it simple. What's new, since I ordered last time, is they give you options to upgrade the plain naan( which I did to garlic naan) and I added two mango lassis to drink.   They always deliver much faster than I expect which is a huge plus, and are always pleasant. The food is good with very authentic, satisfying flavors. Love the delicious (but small) mango lassi which is delivered in a styrofoam coffee cup for transport. The lassi is a little expensive for the price, but really helps cool down the spiciness of the meal. The garlic naan is served large and warm and is a great vehicle to scooping up the sauce of the dish. The chicken dishes are plenty on sauce , a little light on chicken , but the chicken that's there is very tender and good.   Is it my favorite Indian restaurant? Heck no, but they get bonus points for delivering to the South Side. The last time I went to People's restaurant on Penn Ave, I asked when they would (pretty please) open a place in the South Side because we need them! They said they had thought about it , and if they found the right location ...maybe. So, until we get our own(hopefully tasty and BYOB) Indian place in the neighborhood, I will continue in the vein of Crosby, Stills & Nash, to \"love the one you're with\" 'til the sweet day I can [eat at] the Indian restaurant I love.",

First, they reduced the price from $9-10 per person to $6 per person, but they severely diluted the food and took away the free soft drinks. Most watery Indian food ever now. The tikka masala actually resembled soup -- I don't think there was any cream in it any more.   Secondly, THEY KICKED ME OUT OF MY SEAT AT NINE MONTHS PREGNANT. Very rude server told me I had to leave after sitting there for 15 minutes -- at nine months pregnant. I told him he was rude, he shrugged, he didn't care.  This restaurant is an atrocity at this point. I used to get lunch and takeout here regularly but I will NEVER go back now. I can get better Indian food out of a box and better service off of a food truck at this point. Unbelievable.",

It appeared that the dishes we ordered overlapped with the buffet offerings, as we felt the dishes may have come from the buffet line. However, the dishes we ordered (Saag Paneer, Biriyani, and garlic naan) were all still very tasty. We also got chai tea (which we saw did come from the buffet line) and a Rasmalai for dessert to share. Was a bit difficult to get the attention of an employee to refill water cups.

The food was delicious, plentiful and hot. They had everything I wanted to satisfy my Indian food craving and some! There were items I never had before like these sweet little balls on the buffet that were to die for! The chicken was all cooked to perfection and the taste was just right. The food was definitely on the less spicy end but that was ok. My favorite part about the meal was the naan! We got garlic naan with our meal and it was hands down the best naan I have ever had!   All in all I was debating between giving this place 4 or 5 stars. I usually keep the 5 star reviews for a knock your pants off type of meal and atmosphere so I went with 4. That doesn't mean this place wasn't amazing! For a $13 Indian buffet this is tough to beat.   They also offer alcohol, desserts, student discounts and more!

I would normally go for medium but after my last experience where a 7/10 was super mild I went for the hot, but my paneer sag came out with an obvious red tinge instead of a predominantly green color and it was so spicy I could barely eat it, and I love spicy food! I actually couldn't finish it since it was starting to bother my stomach which normally never happens to me when I eat spicy food. It had to be at least a \"very hot\" if not an \"Indian hot\" level.  I normally eat a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the spicy scale at other Indian restaurants but this was definitely higher. And it wasn't balanced well since the spice just overpowered all the other flavors so it was all I could taste. The food is generally good, and the service is prompt, but I wish they would get more consistent with their spice levels.",

As for the main dishes- I had chicken korma, my go-to favorite. It was excellent. I had a medium spice level and I'm someone who loves super spicy food. Medium is PLENTY spicy!! So keep that in mind maybe. My boyfriend had butter chicken, mild and it was also excellent!! Both will be re-ordered!   The service was great- everyone was so friendly and attentive.

    "text": "I had a large (10) group of doctors meeting this evening who wanted Indian take out delivered to west penn.  After some calling around I was pleased to find out that prince of India delivered to the hospital.  We needed the food delivered as close to 5p as possible as we didn't want to interrupt the meeting by having it come later.  So at 240p (since they are closed 3-430). I called to see if I could place the order to give them plenty of time to make, etc.  They thanked us for doing this.   5pm comes and almost on the dot the delivery driver calls to say he's in the lobby.  Fantastic!  I get the food - (and left a hefty tip!) and take it up to to the docs. 5 of them got chicken tikka masala - all different spice levels.  NOT A SINGLE CONTAINER WAS MARKED.   Really?!?  Note to prince of India staff:  this would be incredibly helpful.  So the person who got a level 1 may have been stuck with a 5.  Not cool prince of India.  Really - not cool.    Not a single container out of everything - vegetarian dishes, meat dishes, etc were marked. So it was a guessing game.  The naan (enough for 12) was essentially crumbled into a ball - no one could get a full piece of naan.    Oh - to make matters better we paid for raita - but I am currently sitting in the lobby (530p) waiting for it to be brought because they didn't bring it - or the driver left it in the car.  I was told 10 minutes - when I called them at 505p.  We asked for a credit - because everyone is done eating.  They refused. So we have wasted food and money.  It was finally delivered at 5:40p.  We have another meeting like this in January and were planning Indian food.  But I don't imagine it will be with prince of India again.  What a disappointment.  Definitely avoid take out.",

I threw up almost 4 time after having that last night. Pathetic food. I would have given -5 if there was an option. Health loss + $20 wasted!",

I have been going to Prince of India since my freshmen years ago and I had nothing but postive experiences for years but today may be my last day after what I found in my takeout buffet box.  I ordered the buffet for takeout and as I was enjoying my lunch at home I found a MOSTLY EATEN SOGGY, CHEWED UP, NAAN in my chicken...Nope, not my own naan that I got because I had two FULL pieces of naan that I had previously already finished. I immediately stopped eating and just threw the rest away as my appetitie was now gone.  Now how does a chewed up, eaten naan get into FRESHLY COOKED FOOD that is brought out often for the buffet? Well either someone was trying to sabotage the business which is highly unlikely because just why would someone do that or like other shady buffet restaurants, they REUSE FOOD brought back to the kitchen.   There is absolutely NO REASON why leftover food brought back into the kitchen should go ANYWHERE NEAR freshly cooked food unless it is done on purpose. I am sorry but there is simply NO EXCUSE for this type of behavior.",

Unlike other places we've found around here, they actually bring the heat without being overpowering.  We opted for an order of chicken tikka masala, malai kofta and naan. The chicken was in large, juicy chunks and the kofta was well seasoned and creamy. The naan was crispy and chewy all at the same time.  I think they also do happy hour specials from 5-7 that includes $3 off chicken entrees and a rotating deal of cheaper appetizers depending on the day.   We'll definitely be coming back here often!",

    "text": "I stopped by here last night with my wife for dinner.  The Prince of India is located right on Fifth Ave and was easy to find.  Upon entering the restaurant we saw a sign telling us to wait to be seated and within 30 seconds or so were on our way to the table.  We ended up in a booth but there were also some regular tables as well.  After getting seated we were asked whether we wanted the buffet or regular menu and we both choose the regular menu.  They also had a decent happy hour going on (4:00 or 4:30 - 7:00 PM) which had Yuenglings for $2 and Dales Pale Ale for $2.75.  For dinner on this evening I decided to go with the chicken curry while my wife went with her standby, the chicken tikka masala.  Both my wife and I were asked how spicy we would like our food and My wife went with a mild and upon my choice of Hot, I was told to give the number between 1-10 and chose 8.  We also decided to split some garlic naan and I ordered a Dales Pale Ale while my wife went with water.  After a short wait all of our food came to the table and it was definitely the naan which looked the best.  On my first bite of chicken curry I realized how hot they had made the dish.  It was hot to the point where I could hardly taste the spices in the chicken.  That's not a complaint about Prince of India as that's how an 8 probably should be, but more of a comment about how most other restaurants won't give you a super spicy dish.  The chicken in my dish ended up being cooked nicely and was hot temperature wise and juicy.  My only complaint about the dish was that there wasn't enough of the chicken, especially for the $12.50 price.  While eating my entree I also dug into the naan which ended up being fantastic.  It had a nice texture to it and was covered with a lot of garlic which gave it some great flavor.  My wife enjoyed both it and her entree.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  The Prince of India has a nice happy hour and I appreciated the fact that they made their food spicy when requested, now if there was just a bit more of it.",

    "text": "Stopped by here today for their Oakland Restaurant Week lunch special: $6 for one trip (one plate) to the lunch buffet and drinks cost extra. Dine-in only!! I've always wanted to try this place and I finally chose today to do it.  I came in around 2:00 and it was 3/4 empty, so I was seated and received my water really quickly. The server was really nice and courteous. The food was really good! The lunch buffet selection is small, but they had all the popular dishes. All of the curries were really delicious and flavorful. The rice was cooked really well. The veggie pakora (?) was old/over-fried because it was hard and really dry. And there was only one piece of naan bread left when I went up (which was also hard and dry), which was really disappointing because naan is my favorite part of Indian food but I didn't want to bother waiting for it to come out and/or possibly getting in trouble because I was only allowed a trip.  All in all, I think the food is really good but I don't think the restaurant week special was really that worth it. For a few bucks more you can do all-you-can-eat option with a drink included and a discount if you're a student or UPMC employee. I would definitely like to come here again in the future.",

The only veggies are mushy peas, mushy carrots, and mushy potatoes. I asked for a 2 out of 5 spicy and it was VERY spicy. And I'm not a weakling when it comes to spice. Way over salted.   Raita... I definitely didn't get extra. My biryani should have had some and then I spent $4 on extra. I only got 1 container. It also tasted very salty, somehow.   Prince naan... this was the standout. Cooked well, lots of flavor. Very good.   Salad... literally just lettuce, onion, tomato, and cucumber. Didn't see any peppers and didn't come with any dressing. Big big thumbs down.",

    "text": "This place has almost no redeeming qualities. I've been here twice and both times I was underwhelmed.   On my first visit I went with one other person and we ordered some appetizers and got  the buffet. It was about 6 pm on a Thursday and the place was deserted. The appetizers came out of the kitchen hot, and they were pretty yummy. Except for the paneer pakora -- that was just boring. As other reviewers have mentioned, everything on the buffet is just dull and seemed like it had been there for a while. Malai kofta was one of the buffet options and it's one of my favorites. I was very disappointed. The dumplings had raisins in them or something of similar size that was sweet and squishy. Very unappetizing. The sauce wasn't nearly creamy enough to be a proper malai kofta. By the time we left there were more people trickling in, but the place isn't very popular, for good reason.  On my second trip (I only returned because someone had a Groupon), the place was equally deserted. Again, just a party of two. Since, I'd already experienced the buffet we decided to order off the menu. Keep in mind the restaurant was empty, so when the waiter came over to take our order we were expecting awesome service. We certainly weren't expecting him to answer the phone that was attached to his hip and stand in front of our table chatting with someone in another language. I generally like listening to people speak in languages I don't understand, but standing right next to me for an uncomfortably long time while I'm trying to chat with my dining companion was just rude. We did finally get to order though. We ordered garlic naan and another kind of naan as well as tarka dal and the malai kofta (I advised against this).   Now, I didn't know what tarka dal was when I ordered it, but it was described as a bean dish with lots of ginger. Sounded like my kind of thing and I wanted to order something that I didn't think would be on the buffet. When our food arrived I was very disappointed to see that he brought us dal makhani instead. The waiter even called it tarka dal when he set it down. I might have known what tarka dal was, but I sure as hell can recognize my absolute favorite Indian dish when you put it in front of me! A simple internet search was enough to convince us that there was no way tarka dal could be some variation of dal makhani since the two dishes are generally made with completely different lentils and are therefore different colors! The kitchen just didn't want to make the damned tarka dal and brought us the stuff that was on the buffet! The malai kofta was, again, icky. No raisin-things this time, but the nuts in the dumplings were almond slivers, not cashews. The two kinds of naan we ordered were nothing but soggy, salty piles of grease. All that and the service never improved. Drink refills were slow, we didn't even bother asking for another round of drinks from the bar, and it took far too long to get the check.   In hindsight, I'm a glad they didn't actually bring me tarka dal when I ordered it. I'm sure they would have just messed it up. I've since made it myself and it's delicious. I recommend you try it, just not here. Don't eat here.",

    "text": "Food: Prince of India has an expansive menu consisting of everything you would expect from an Indian restaurant, and they also appear to have a buffet. We didn't order the buffet, so I can't comment about what is on it or when it is offered beyond confirming that a buffet option does exist. There are many meat and seafood options, and there is a menu page devoted exclusively to vegetarian items, one of the biggest vegetarian selections among Pittsburgh Indian restaurants that I've seen. We started with the Dall (lentil) soup, which was steaming hot and loaded with lentils and flavor. We also ordered the garlic naan, which was just as good as any other naan we've had in the city. For an appetizer, we tried the Samosa Chat which are samosas smothered in chick peas, tomatoes and sauce. There weren't many samosas (maybe 2 small ones), but there was an abundance of chick peas, and the sauce covering them was the best part of the entire dinner. The lead-up to our entrees was impressive, but we were slightly disappointed by the main courses. We ordered the Baingen Aloo, which was surprisingly bland and had little to no flavor or spice. We also ordered the Vegetable Mango Curry, which had considerably more flavor, but wasn't anything special. Entrees are ordered on a spiciness scale of 1-10, and the 7 I ordered was accurate; very spicy but not overwhelming. Overall, nothing we tried was bad, although the entrees left something to be desired after the excellent soup and appetizer.  Price: Prices are very reasonable, particularly the entrees. The most expensive vegetarian entree was $10.99, and the majority were cheaper. The portion sizes are smaller than most Indian restaurants, but there is more than enough to eat your fill and likely bring some home. The soup was huge for only $2.99, and the appetizer, which was $4.99, was probably bigger than either entree.  Drinks: There is a full bar and multiple beer selections, which is different than most of Pittsburgh's Indian restaurants, and definitely as asset. We ordered bottles of Taj Mahal, which we hadn't tasted before, and were surprised by how good it was. The menu also includes typical Indian non-alcoholic drinks like mango lassi and chai tea.  Atmosphere: The dining room is large with tables for parties of all sizes. There was a group of 20+ sitting down the center of the room, so they can accommodate very large groups. The location directly on Fifth Avenue in Oakland makes parking tricky, particularly on weekend evenings. Overall, the atmosphere and decor are comfortable and casual.    Service: Our waiter was very attentive, filling our water glass almost obsessively. He spoke English, but not excellent, and struggled to answer some of our questions about the menu. Our soup and appetizers came together, which we didn't consider ideal, and our entrees were out before we had finished any of the earlier courses. But we definitely didn't have to wait for anything, including the bill.  (+): fair prices, good food, good service  (-): although nothing was particularly wrong, nothing was spectacular  Would I go back again? Probably for lunch to get the soup and appetizer again, or, if giving dinner a second chance, I would try a more standard Indian entree like Chana Masala.",

I was initially nervous about ordering from POI after reading the previous (older) reviews, not to mention my failure to find good Indian food so far in da Burgh!  I'm glad I took the chance:) Delivery was as expected through grub hub, about 60 minutes after the delivery was placed. I added a comment to ask if they would \"please make (the food) very spicy.\" And they did not disappoint! Usually my request for very spicy food (a 10 on a spice scale of 10) gets me something more like a 4 or 5 on my personal spice scale. I was so pleasantly surprised that the chole and aloo gobi were made both flavorful AND very spicy. (Literally brought tears to my eyes!) This, however is the kind of spice I like, so for those who can't handle it, be mindful of the spice scale- it's taken seriously!

    "text": "my husband and I really love Indian food and before we moved here from Baltimore we'd order it via delivery pretty frequently. So we decided to give this place a shot. Calling the order in was painful, The person who was taking the order had us repeat numbers frequently and even after spelling Walnut twice, he still did not seem sure that he knew what we were telling him. We should have taken this as a sign.  I ordered palak paneer - my favorite - what arrived was very different - something with peas and it was orange instead of green. When we called in to complain the person who answered the phone did not understand what the problem was and passed the phone to someone else who argued with us telling us we did not order palak paneer but what I found out later to be mata paneer. I've never even heard of this - we did not have a menu and just ordered our favorites.  Instead of trying to make the situation right, by replacing the food or offering to remove the wrong dish from our bill ,they offered the next entree free.   We continued with dinner and immediately we knew this was the worst Indian carry out we'd ever had. the sauces were really thin and tasted weird. The cheese in my dish had a really off texture compared to the dozen or so places I've ordered this dish from. Since I had never tried mata paneer before maybe it is supposed to taste like a lot of sugar was added. I do, however, know that Tikka Masala is not supposed to taste sour. We had asked for both to be medium spicy but the chef must have put the spice in twice, it was so hot that it was barely edible. The garlic and regular nan, on the other hand, was excellent. The rice that came with it lacked all of the cardamon pods etc in it that I've always had with indian carry out.... it was just plain, really dry, unseasoned rice.  After tossing out most of it both of us felt very ill and bloated after the meal, i really thought I was going to vomit. Between the service and the lack of quality of the meal, we will never order from this place again. They can keep their free entree.",

    "text": "Visited their lunch buffet this past weekend, and I was pleased.  I don't think it is the best Indian buffet in Pittsburgh (I prefer Taste of India by Children's Hospital) but it was good.  They had four vegetarian dishes (chana masala, pakoras soaking in curry sauce, palak paneer, and an eggplant dish), three chicken dishes (chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken and chicken curry), pakoras, papadums, a salad bar, and gulab jamuns.  The eggplant dish was my favorite.  The buffet is $7.99, and we got two $2 off coupons after we paid.    The only downside is a lot of their dishes contain nuts, even the ones you wouldn't expect like vegetable korma and paneer tikka masala.  If you have allergies, just ask them to leave the nuts out - I have never found any in my dishes once I started asking the cook to omit them.    I also have been ordering from here about once a week and I think they are reasonably priced, the portions are big, their delivery is reliable (they're rarely late and they've occasionally been up to half an hour early), and the food is good.  I'm definitely a big fan.",

    "text": "Absolutely disgusting. Entrees arrived with a full inch of grease pooled on the top and the sauces were gloppy and unappetizing. I had Malai Koftas, and the koftas were like giant balls of flavorless paste. Even the naan was bad. Naan is easy as hell for even this home cook to make, there is no excuse for that. Never ever eat here.",

    "text": "Straight down the middle.  I tried the lunch buffet to get a sense of their style of Indian cuisine and found that it was well stocked; appeared to be clean and sanitary; and with a good amount of options. At bat for the veg team were vegetable korma, palak paneer, channa masala, and pakora masala. Assisting were vegetable pakoras, plain naan, basmati rice,  papadam, raita, salad fixings, a good assortment of chutneys (about 5), and fountain drinks included in the buffet price. Batting cleanup were galub jamun and rice pudding. Quite a spread, especially considering there were also about 4 meatalicious entrees all for about $8.99. I'm not sure if the special runs everyday, but 10% is taken off if you are a local student and show ID.  So, why the A-OK rating? While items of concern such as service, cleanliness, atmosphere, etc. were as they ought to be, the food taste didn't have the spark that I look for in my dining experiences. I honestly appreciated that there were veg dishes that had a little spice to them and that there were so many options, but their curry interpretations are very creamy, which just isn't my bag. To each their own, and this may be right up your alley.",

    "text": "Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Masala for delivery while I was holed up in my dorm, working on a late-night project.  The food is a lot saltier and less interesting than I remembered.  I've had better experiences ordering from them, so I'll give 3 stars instead of 2, but the sauces weren't great.  Chickpeas were pretty good, but there was too much onion for my tastes.  Ordering through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCampusFood.com&s=e8c03a36127464f26ef33995dc8219b0344f5d57bd6a893a474ad22d9d973d36\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">CampusFood.com</a> was convenient as usual, and the delivery guy was polite for the whole three seconds he was standing there.",

The price is just right.   It makes me sad that everytime I come here there is no one else there.  Plus they heavily discount their dinner dishes.  If I lived closer and parking was easier, I'd eat here more often.",

The food they gave me was nasty and the chicken was not cooked properly. Also they overcharge for naans. I highly recommend not to go to this place",
