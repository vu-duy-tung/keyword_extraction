Only a few on their list were local, and the draft prices were a little high. The bar snacks for also expensive for the quality. $10 for a plate of deviled eggs (5 or 6 halves) and another $10 or $11 for bruschetta (2 slices of toast). I was really excited to try the hummus, but it was super bland.  I wish you could order food downstairs from the pizza place and bring it up!",

You are looking at an apartment building and the walls of other buildings. I guess it's good if you just want to have the feeling of being outside. We looked around and saw reserved signs on lot of tables but there where some without the signs so we set down and waited for the waitress to show up. The place was busy but it definitely had lot of open tables. Our waitress told us that we are not aloud to seat ourself, so we had to go back to register to get a table. I was not happy about that, hence all the open tables nobody was using. We had to go get our drinks at the bar and wait around another 10 minutes and then we were seated back at a table. Just seems a little weird rule for a bar.",

    "text": "In keeping with transparency, here is the majority of an email I sent directly the the Manager of Il Tetto. As I mention in my email, I believe this issue to be fundamental and consistent and doesn't appear to be getting better.   After some deliberation, I've decided that I must write to you regarding my - and my group's - awful experience on Thursday night. If this were the first time I'd had a negative experience at your business, you wouldn't hear from me. However, I believe this to be a fundamental and recurring flaw, one that has occurred just about every time that I've visited Il Tetto. Simply put, the combative and disrespectful nature of your staff is a travesty. As a small business owner, as well as a full time bartender, it's also an embarrassment. Only on the most rare occasions have I been treated in such a confrontational and dismissive manner. As I mentioned, Thursday night was one of these occasions. I'd be happy top share details with you, if you care, but I'll leave it as your Door/Elevator Operator/Security Staff need serious training when it comes to customer service and interaction. This was not the first time and I've come to the conclusion it will not be the last. My friends and I WILL NOT be coming back. There are too many other fine establishments in the neighborhood that appreciate our business and show RESPECT to their customers. I understand the nature of these people's jobs: Dealing with people who have been drinking, generally in high volumes, etc. But the idea that being combative and disrespectful right from the start of an interaction will only ever end with an extremely negative experience. I've had enough. My friends have had enough. And from what I'm seeing on social media - and just in the several issues I've had at your place of business - this is not uncommon.",

I have tried it three different times & every time the experience is the same. I have asked several other people their opinion & they agree with me. We went up there waiting for our table at Sienna Mercato & are always treated with disrespect & eye rolls. They act like their tables are gold plated reserved for royalty. It also takes ten years to get a drink at the bar. The tables are always dirty with other people's drinks. It's definitely not worth going there. Next time I will go down the street to Seviche until No Wait says my table is ready. If they don't cleanup their act they will close. The bad service baffles me because it is so great at Sienna Mercato & Sienna on the plaza. I heard mezzo is great too. Il Tetto, get your act together & Fire your surly hostesses.",

    "text": "I have never had such a bad experience. I have lived in major metro areas all over the country, and have never experienced such terrible service. We came to celebrate a birthday and had a group of about 12. Now, I've dined in many an eatery with large groups, and I have NEVER been advised that the wait would be over 2 hours at Sienna Mercato. BUT, it was a birthday celebration.   Well, how can I say this gently? Aside from being grossly overpriced ($10 for some roasted seasoned nuts, anyone? Perhaps $22 for a cheese tray?), the appetizers were not good to say the least and we were flat out profiled. Sit tight. This is long...  We arrived at the restaurant around 6:15pm. We were told that wait would be long, but we could always pass some time upstairs at the Beer Garden. Fine. So we head up to the 3rd floor and stand around aimlessly for about 15-20 minutes until someone finally acknowledged the presence of a pretty sizable group. The server began to take drink orders, including water with lemon for the table. We were told that we could not have water, as they had no glasses. Ok. We will wait a few minutes for water. After waiting about 20 minutes for our water, they brought out glasses halfway full of room temperature water. Now, that's not such a big deal, but it was just the first of a string of issues with this place. We began placing drink orders and appetizers, and our server was nice enough. When the apps began to come out, it spiraled quickly downhill from here. We sent back an order of bruschetta (who throws raw tomatoes and cold cheese on soggy wonder bread and calls it an appetizer??), as well as some other pork/cat food/raw egg situation... So we ordered wings instead. The wings were tasty, which was the only saving grace. At one point, one of the wait staff came over and asked if we had ordered another bruschetta, and we laughed and said \"Not over here. We just sent one back\". He looked at me, rolled his eyes and snapped his neck and said \"did you order this or not?\" With a heck of an attitude. I stared blankly at him. Really, sir?? Ok. So I requested a manager. Mind you, we had been upstairs for about an hour waiting for our table by this time. When the manager finally came over (after 3 requests) the manager came over and seemed less than interested in helping, accommodating, or addressing the issues. She pretty much rolled her eyes at everything that was said to her with regard to the less than stellar experience we had had up to that point (piss poor customer service, anyone?).   We finally began inquiring about the state of our table downstairs, fed up with the foolishness upstairs. She cashed out our tabs saying that there shouldn't be much more of a wait. It was 8:03pm, as per the stamp on my receipt. The young lady called down and returned at 9:15pm (she never returned during that hour to check and see if we needed anything else. Another drink. Water. Nothing.) to inform us that it would be at least another hour. 3.5 hours for a table?? In Pittsburgh?? HOW? No one had a good answer. We then requested another manager. The one that showed up claimed to be the GM, and simply added to the attitude filled eye rolling party started by the initial, dark haired manager. She told us that we could either wait for at least another 45, or we could leave. No attempts to accommodate our group at all. They were BOTH extremely dismissive and very, VERY rude. We began explaining to them how disappointed we were at the treatment we had received. We expressed how we simply wanted to sit down and enjoy dinner. We expressed that it was simply UNHEARD OF to have to wait for 3.5 hours for a table for dinner. Neither cared.   So, as we continued having conversation with the two managers about the awful experience, the manager that told us that we could either wait or leave was apparently tired of hearing what we had to say. She signaled to the dark haired manager, AND THIS WOMAN LEANED OVER INTO HER MIC AND REQUESTED SECURITY! SECURITY?? For what? Because we were dissatisfied with our service?? Because they were tired of hearing the criticism from a group of people that had been waiting WELL OVER 3 HOURS TO BE SEATED? Security walks over and we all are just stunned at what was happening. There was NO vulgarity. No threats of violence (who does that over a table for dinner? It's NEVER that serious). There was no yelling, cursing, disrespect, or anything of the sort. Just a group of people being treated TERRIBLY by what should be a customer service based organization.   The sub par, overpriced food, the ignorant and disrespectful wait and management staff, and the lack of general concern or desire to accommodate a group of young professionals, and the blatant racial profiling that took place will cause me to NEVER set foot in this establishment again. EVER. I am highly disappointed and will be contacting the corporate entity to be sure that this is addressed.   Never again",

Find me a place that has both, and I will be your number one customer.  I'm excited to say that the visionaries behind Sienna Mercato are now two for two with the recent opening of Il Tetto.  Now you have the mother of all dilemmas.  Will you get your meatball on at Emporio (located on the first floor) before or after you take the elevator ride to Il Tetto's gorgeous rooftop beer garden?   As some of you know I've been anticipating the opening of Il Tetto for some time.  As the cosmos would have it, their second night in operation just happened to be my birthday.  No lie, I was a tad nervous bringing my band of friends to a locale I had never been before, but the idea of a spacious rooftop bar in downtown was just too darn tempting to pass up.  My imagination had nothing on this place.  Upon exiting the elevator, my jaw dropped a bit.  The rain had stayed at bay, allowing the retractable glass ceiling to reveal a portion of the city's skyline and a pleasant nighttime breeze.  Seating options varied from cozy nooks to sizable party tables.  The bar, which lined an entire stretch of wall, was inviting as well.  No matter where you sit, be sure to look up and admire the gas lamps and charming strings of lights.  The decor is pleasing to most anyone I'd wager, from sports fans (there were several TVs playing the Buccos game) to those seeking a romantic rendezvous and anyone in between.    So, Il Tetto is picturesque, you get it.  But looks will only get you so far (as my grandma loved to remind me when I'd get \"gussied up.\")  I needed to get my hands on a birthday libation.  Lucky for me, the draft list is equally as impressive as Emporio's.  The reason?  Each of the 32 drafts that are downstairs are piped up to Il Tetto's bar.  You can also imbibe on wine and specialty cocktails if you prefer.   In regards to food, the menu provides a select list of small plates ranging from munchies like house-made Pork Rinds to heavier dishes like the Duck Confit Steak Fries.  We ordered the latter.  The fries were crisp, yet tender and the duck fat gravy added a velvety richness to the plentiful shreds of duck meat.  The topping of a sunny side-up egg added yet another level of richness and texture.  In other words, it was...

We took it so we didn't have to wait any longer.... That was a mistake.  Our server Braydon was friendly but less than attentive. She  walked by our table numerous times, looked at us, but stopped for drink orders from the tables next to us. When she finally stopped - we only saw her a handful of times.    Our drinks were decent - my friend's drink had an extremely heavy pour.  Our appetizers were good (the nuts!)  but a bit overpriced ($10) for a bowl full of nuts.

    "text": "I love the atmosphere at Il Tetto. It is a great spot to hang out after work and have a few beers with the co-workers.   However, I'm giving il Tetto three stars because of the not so great prices/appetizers and awkward ID process.   A few of my co-workers held a happy hour at Il Tetto for me to celebrate my move to a different department. I was actually running late....I know late to my own happy hour....and as soon as the elevator door opened I hopped off, saw my co-workers waving me over, and proceed to hurry on over. Well, I totally forgot about their awkward ID process. You have to actually hand a \"bouncer\" your ID As soon as you get off the elevator. I forgot to do this since I was in a rush to get over to my co-workers. Well, i shouldn't have forgotten.... The \"bouncer\" rushes up behind me and touches me on the shoulder to get my attention. This was totally awkward and uncomfortable. I understand it is their process, but maybe he could have let me set my things down and been a bit more relaxed in how he asked for my ID. just a suggestion.   Another thing I'm not too crazy about is the menu. They don't have the best beer selection for the prices. I paid almost $6 for one yuengling summer wheat beer. I drank imported German beer for $6 in a bar in NYC (this was a rare find, I know). But, still... $6 for a yuengling and it wasn't even a craft beer. Next, I do not care much for the food options/prices. One of the appetizers was $18!",

Being on a rooftop on a nice night feels like the world is open and full of possibilities; I love it.  Strung lights, nice wooden tables, trendy atmosphere. Fancy drinks that are pricey but delicious and I guess you pay for the ambiance also.  I'm so excited for good weather to come (consistently) so that we can celebrate rooftops again! :D",

Service is the one thing that will keep me coming back, even if the food or drinks are nothing to write home about.   We decided to venture in here one day, and it was not insanely busy. A decent sizes crowd but nothing insane with waits or anything.  We were first rudely cut in front of immediately in front of the host stand.  Bad experience part one.  They saw what happened, and even though the person brought meatballs from downstairs which you aren't supposed to do from what I heard them telling her, they still seated the rude lady first.  Finally, someone takes us to a seat... Where we wait, and wait and wait and aren't even greeted by a server.  We waited long enough.  We had seen servers greeting ppl who were seated long after us, but somehow, our little area was being ignored. Being hungry, and annoyed, I decided it was not a place I wanted to spend my money and left.    I won't be back to the rooftop there... Thankfully our experiences at Emporio have been better, so we will at least go there.",

As expected, it gets very busy.  You have to wait in a line downstairs until people leave.  Then you take the elevator up and deal with more crowds.  Despite the number of people, the bartenders were very quick and pleasant.  Drinks were incredible but pricey.  We had to leave just because we didn't want to keep dropping $10 for each drink.  Another negative is how hot it was.  There was absolutely no circulating air.  No relief whatsoever.  It appeared as though there were AC units behind the bar but we couldn't feel anything.  Even some industrial fans would have helped.",

If there isn't a line to take the elevator, there's a line to get a drink. I've never had the food here so I can't speak on that. The drinks are not too bad, but quite expensive. What I don't understand, though, is they have the exact same drinks as Emporio downstairs, yet they don't have the same happy hour specials.  They're banking on getting more interest upstairs so they can get away with charging more. Seems a little unfair since it's technically one business.",

Drinks are insanely expensive and the food was ridiculously expensive as well.    The worst part about this place was we went on a rainy night and they had the roof covered. It was so hot and humid in there I was miserable! I mean really, is it too much to ask for a little AC or at the very less a fan? I'm paying $13 a drink over here, people!!!   Go to the bar a couple doors down. It was a dive but they have drink specials every night of the week and cheap food. I can't recall the name but it is directly across from the Marriott courtyard, some sort of Irish pub/dive bar.

Loved the appetizers and the craft beers on tap, hard cider options and wine - everyone can order their favorite drink here.

    "text": "Went to this beer garden (my first one ever, if that's notable in any case) with some friends while waiting for a table for the meatball joint that is Sienna Mercato. Not going to lie, but I initially wasn't too thrilled at the idea of going here seeing some of the recent reviews. However, I didn't find it to be as bad as people were saying. For one thing, we went on a rainy day and they had the rooftop cover raised to help keep the attendees dry from the rain. However, I think they learned a lesson from those who complained on this platform earlier in the summer seeing as the roof was not completely enclosed this time around (thankfully), which allowed for the heat that comes from having so many people in an enclosed space at one time to escape into the rainy night outside. Service was prompt and at least from what I remember, I don't remember having any incidents with rude waitresses, people, etc. As for drinks, they have a nice sized selection of beers, wines, cocktails, and drafts. I ended up sharing a hard cider with a friend and found it to be quite satisfactory. They also have a decent size menu for appetizers and small eats, but taking one look at the prices ... yeah a little hard to swallow. Overall, it's an okay venue to share a drink with friends ... a little on the loud side, but that's to be expected in a place with a lot of people.",

    "text": "We would have given this four stars, but we had a terrible customer service experience.   We were seated right away on Friday night. The beer list was great, and we ordered two beers that were very tasty. A little too much time passed before our server asked about our food order. We asked about the cheese plate, and our server seemed only slightly knowledgeable. We ordered it anyway ($22), and also ordered the mushroom risotto and octopus.   The mushroom risotto was excellent, and the octopus was very good. The cheese plate was also good, except there wasn't enough bread. This is where the bad customer service came in.   We asked for more bread, the server told us it would be $5. We balked, and said \"we've ordered cheese all over the world and have never been charged for more bread. We want to talk to a manager.\"   Our server went away for a while and came back and said, \"my mistake, it's $3\". We said, \"how about $1\", he said he would get a manager.   Some woman came over, although she didn't identify her job title. We asked for more bread, gratis. She said, \"$3\". We suggested that she sell us the bread for the reasonable price of $1, or else she should suggest something else to make us satisfied. She had no suggestions. She said she would talk to the chef, and that she didn't have the right \"pull\". We said, \"we want to talk to someone with pull.\" At this point, our check was around $100. They really wanted that $3 more than for us to have a positive experience, I guess.   After several minutes, \"Chris\" came by, who seemed to have the necessary 'pull' to get us our darn bread we needed to finish eating our $22 cheese. However, rather than try to make us satisfied customers, he acted defensive.  Note to restauranteurs: if folks on $100 checks want bread to enjoy their cheese, don't try to squeeze $3 out of them. A satisfied customer is worth much more than that. We will not be back.",

Just as a warning, it is sometimes difficult to get up to this space. The host desk will direct you to an incredibly slow elevator in the back of Emporio to get you up there. I repeat, the elevator is so slow, and if you're with a crowd, it's going to take a while to get up there.   When the weather is right, this place is a gorgeous spot to see the city. From the deck, you get to see the city from a new angle, and it boasts a great view of the river.    Early in the evening, the rooftop bar has a laid back vibe. There have been times I've gone later and it has been crazy up there, and impossible to get a table. The draft list is fun, but overpriced for even craft beer lovers.  I've been to Il Tetto several times, but only eaten there once. The food menu is small and overpriced compared to the first two floors of the Sienna Mercato establishment. We ordered several small plates including the meat & cheese, and house-made pork rinds. Neither were worth writing home about, and while I enjoyed the view and draft list, I don't think I'd eat there again.   This place is perfect for a drink and a view before you head off to somewhere better to eat.",

Upon entering the building on the first floor we saw that the steps were closed and knowing that the beer garden was on the third floor, we had to ask how to get upstairs.  The hostess directed us to the elevator which is in the exact opposite corner of the restaurant as the one that you enter from.  This seemed to be somewhat counter intuitive as I would think you would want people to be able to get to all of your spaces.  Once we finally made it upstairs you could tell that this was a pretty awesome place. There was a bar the length of the roof as well as a good number of tables.  The tables were not crowded in though and left plenty of room for standing around and hanging out.  The decor consisted of gas lamps with some stringed lights in-between and also what I think is a retractable glass roof that was open the night that we were there.  Their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers.  Most of these I think were seasonal since it was autumn and the list was dominated by pumpkin beers.  Our server ended up being pretty nice to us and I found service to be decent especially for the number of people that were there.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I found the beers themselves to be somewhat overpriced, the vibe of the place was pretty awesome and is what would get me to come back again.",

I'd never been to Il Tetto before, and I have to say, based on this experience I doubt I'll be back anytime soon. Maybe I'll give it a year or two. It really left a bad taste.  First and foremost, I understand the challenges of the space. To get to Ill Tetto, you have to take an elevator. Before which there is a very long line to wait in. Thankfully, they had a server there to take charge you out the wazoo by 'offering' you an alcoholic beverage.  When you do finally get up to the rooftop, there's a huge wall of people. As far as your eye can see, people everywhere. The bar is 2-3ppl deep. All the tables are taken. There are groups of people hanging around a table that had raffle baskets on it.  So everyone rushes out of the elevator and go in search of more beverages, and maybe a place to sit. It's important to mention here that usually Il Tetto is open seating, first come first served. I know this by looking at past reviews all over the internet. Thus when the crowd from my elevator rushes out to find seats, I follow suit.  Well eventually I find a table, and join 3 other ladies already sitting there. Thankfully they agreed to let me join them. I was planning on being in for one and done, but judging by this crowd, it was going to take an extremely long time to get anything delivered to the table.  A server approached and took my drink order (a froze rose or something similar sounding; basically a frozen rose wine cocktail) along with a debit card to close me out. Right after that is when a manager (assumed based on the suit and earpiece) who asked all of us if anyone had sat us there. The girls said no, and he proceeded to tell us that we couldn't sit there without being sat by the hostess. We also overheard his talking to our server who exclaimed 'that's on you' (I'm assuming about the table controversy)  Well that's terrific. Because none of us had seen one; much less a hostess stand or a sign directing us to wait, or heck, even a reserved sign for the table. The manager proceeded to kick us off the table, and only started to apologize when I exclaimed that this was the worst run event I've seen in a a long long time. He called me 'honey' a couple of times and I was quick to correct him and make sure that didn't happen again.  He apologized for the confusion, and promised a couple of things. Firstly, that he would find us a table ASAP. Secondly, that he'd comp our round of drinks. Then it changed to send out some appetizers. And finally that he'd send out a round of shots.  Eventually we got moved to a table; but not before being forced to wait against a wall, while my dining companions desserts came out and they had no where to eat them, and while this group of girls who were standing near us sat at the table and proceeded to clink their glasses and boast how they eventually got a table and were ecstatic they had to kick someone else off of one to get it.  When we did get to a table, there was further confusion on which server we would have. Let me repeat that. It was apparent that for a space filled with at LEAST 100-150 people that at the tables, there were 2-3 servers max. That's insanely vastly understaffed. We did also see a hostess, eventually. She stood behind the table that held the gift baskets, which was apparently a host stand. Still, there was no communication with anyone coming off the ekevators during the time we were there and more mad dashes for tables. Finally, there were 2 bartenders for a bar that spanned the length of the rooftop, and was 3 people deep at times down the entire length. Also incredibly understaffed.  The manager did make good on a few of the many promises. He comped our first round of drinks. Or rather my first, and my dining companions second round. He also brought out a round of fireball shots. In the meantime, it took about 45 minutes to be told they were out of the frozen rose drink; and I'd need to order something else. I did so; which then took about another 15 minutes to obtain it.  All said and done, it was getting late. I had already been there for two hours and had only been served one drink during that time frame. That's just ridiculous and uncalled for.  So why 3 stars? I feel like an effort to recover was made, and that deserves at least a decent well thought out review and stars that are contemplated. The manager did everything he could do make us happy, and that's sincerely appreciated. He did forget about the appetizers, but again, they were so short staffed, I'm not surprised.  So will I return? Maybe. If a friend wants to go, I'll be suggesting someplace else. If I'm left with no choice, I guess I'll resign myself and dip out early. That's the only way I'll be able to stand it if usual service is like the above.",

Despite that, the service on the roof is abysmal. I truly don't believe that staffing is the issue. These people simply might not care at all. You stand and wait 15-20 minutes without being served as you flash your card right in front of their faces and try to get their attention. I would tip you a lot more if you'd actually pay attention. I paid $18 after settling for two green tea shots (I find it difficult to believe you're completely out of Red Bull when the other two levels under Sienna are dead).  I believe that the experience could be improved overall. Train your bartenders. It's to their own personal benefit to provide decent service.",

We were there early so while there was a crowd, it was nowhere near unbearable. We both LOVED our cocktails - one had tequila & beets, one had bourbon, balsamic and basil. Both amazing (and around $11 each), we stayed for another round.   We sat at the bar and had good service, but didn't order food. The view from the balcony isn't anything to write home about but it was still a nice area to linger in for a bit. We also weren't huge fans of the roped off elevator line situation, but our wait wasn't long at all. Overall this was a great place to soak up some sun on a lovely day.",

At first we saw a huge line out the door and we deterred but we realized that the levels function as separate entities in a way and that we could head right upstairs and snag bar stools. We did! We ordered a couple beers and were very impressed with the selection, I loved that they had Peach Dodo on nitro, it was so delicious! We also ordered the crab dip which was super good! The woman next to us tried to order something from the downstairs menu and was very confused as to why it was not a possibility, that goes back to what i mentioned earlier about them functioning as separate entities, each floor has their own menu and can only honor their menu! On the top floor it is a limited bar menu, but the options all looked and sounded great. Again I recommend the crab dip, soooo good! We also would like to recognize Andrea, she was our main bartender and we really enjoyed her. Even though it was non-stop busy she was fun and entertaining and so sweet! When we left the bar for a moment to admire the over the roof view she brought us our phones because she didn't want them to get stolen, that was very considerate. She is an all-star! Definitely worth checking out and we hope to stop in again next time we are in town, I would like to see how it looks when the rooftop is up!",

Drinks were pretty good; we enjoyed a couple classics (moscow mule & mojito), and tried one of their watermelon cocktails which was okay, although too sugary for our liking. Service was also alright - although we were seated at the bar, it took quite some time to flag down a bartender, and even then, our drinks were forgotten several times. It was a busy night and the bar was definitely pretty lively, so we'll have to try again sometime when the crowd is more manageable.",

At the time I went (December) the glass roof was closed, but still allowed natural light in. The bar is long with plenty of seats. Also, they have a number of large tables that seat 8 or more. The have a diverse, varied craft beer menu. I went with the Alpine Double Hoppines, which was outstanding.  Give this place a chance.",

As far as drinks go this place is a great place to go anytime of the year! (It has a retractable roof!!!!) The view and atmosphere are absolutely amazing, the only other comparable thing would be Biergarten at the Hotel Monaco.   The reason for the four stars is because even though the service and flatbread pizza we got were great the late night snack menu was seriously lacking. Being from out of town, maybe I overestimate Pittsburgher's appetite for a decent late night appetizer menu. I understand cutting costs by only offering flatbread pizzas, but having the choice of bruschetta or nachos or anything other than pizza would have been nice. That being said, the bacon and egg pizza with maple glaze we got was a solid decision and tasted like breakfast morning.   I will keep coming here with friends and family, but maybe just for drinks next time!!!",

Should've known not to come on a Saturday night on a clear evening.... my bad.  A little known fun fact: you have to take an elevator to the third floor. Oh, and guess what? On a clear, Saturday night, you can bet money there is a long long line to get on said elevator to finally enter the rooftop bar.   I had such high hopes and expectations once I finally got on that elevator. But then felt quickly let down at the sight of people crammed like sardines on a roof that barely has standing room. If you are a young, strapping, single person his would be ideal since you are constantly bumping and rubbing up on each other whether you like it or not. But those days are long gone for me...   The drinks were ok but we're a bit pricey. It's a premium you pay to be on a third story rooftop.   I finally got to experience this place but will most likely not return.

I would rather hang out in a basement with the lights off than go back to Il Tetto. I am sad about it, as I really enjoy Sienna on the Square and even Sienna Mercato downstairs.   The appetizers at Il Tetto are sad, overpriced and not worth it. Marinated olives are $10 and not worth it. The beef tartare tastes like bacon and is a million dollars without even mentioning what kind of beef is used.   The atmosphere also lacks anything worth while. The sun was shining the other day but the rooftop bar doesn't seem to let a lot of sun in with different sheets hanging across the rooftop.  It was also far too crowded to be enjoyed. The atmosphere could have been appreciated a lot more if it wasn't so packed. I understand that restaurants want to make money and people equal money. But the key is to make people want to come back. My entire party of 10 will not be coming back.",

Located on the third floor of Sienna Mercato, Il Tetto is their rooftop beer garden, equipped with full bar menu and a small menu of appetizers. In the warmer months the entire roof is retractable and opens up to the sky above, making this place so appealing to the masses. The top floor is pretty large but it definitely draws a crowd, especially for happy hour. The menus for all three levels operate entirely separate, with the Meatball Place on the first level and Mezzo, a pizza/pasta/charcuterie restaurant, on the second. All delicious and unique in their own way. Il Tetto always has a great draft selection, some specialty cocktails including some frozen, and a great wine list as well. At all the tables you'll have wait staff earlier in the day and through happy hour as well. Great spot for out of town guests. Only qualm is how annoying it is to get up top, you must take the slowest elevator in existence from first floor to third. There's a back stair case you can use to exit, though.",

The view is amazing, but that cannot make up for the lack of customer care.  It's a bit confusing to reach here.  You need to take a forever slow elevator to reach the rooftop.  Then when you get out you have to show your ID up top.  How about you have a person downstairs at the elevator entrance to bypass this.  That way you can make a swift entrance upstairs.  Getting up top, it's nice looking and huge.  But everyone seems to want to be up here.  Lots of people everywhere attempting to stake their claim at a table.  Makes for a hard time to move about.  Service, spotty at best.  For me I found that going to the bar myself to get my drink was faster than waiting for a server to get it to me.  I watched as my friends placed orders with their server.  While this happened, I went over to the bar and got my drink and returned to the table way before my friends' drinks arrived at the table.  If I wanted sub par service I would have went to any other bar in the city.",

Which turns out to be $2.50 a basket! The sauces that comes with it wasn't free! You need to pay for them, I wish she told me that though.... I like the seasoning that's in the fries. They were good  Environment This is on a chain of 3 restaurants put together! This one is on the rooftop and when the weather is great they open it. It was good. The seating is open seating but you can always ask the servers for a table and they will make sure they secure a table for you!  Niceness of the staff She was very nice to take our orders. I wish she told me that the sauces were extra. Not that I care but it would be great to know....  Dollar Its a great place during happy hour, get a couple of drinks with great views.  Yes? Yea I wouldn't mind going here again, those happy hour snacks all look great! Im interested to see what the place would be like during winter! Definitely keeping this in my directory  #WendyWanders",

Everything was basically the same as our previous visit, a cool environment up here and it isn't a rowdy bar that people get crazy at. The noise level is above average but you can still have decent conversation at your table and not have to yell. I have to comment about a couple of the drinks we had. One of us had the Frozen Merry Berry, and just like the Frozen Rose I had during the summer, it was surprisingly strong! I had the Rusty Rail Fools Gold beer, a peanut butter hefeweizen. Yuck! I am a huge peanut butter lover but this beer was sooo bad lol. We all tried a sip, and that was all that was missing from my glass when we left. I recommend they get rid of that immediately! Why do I always have to try something new?!",

    "text": "It's great to have a place like Il Tetto (part of Sienna Mercato) in downtown Pittsburgh. I can't think of a better activity on a warm summer night than spending some time relaxing at a rooftop beer garden, especially with as beautiful of a view as Il Tetto's. There are positives and negatives, but generally I enjoy coming here once in a while.  The first positive is that the beer selection is decent. My cousins and I visited Il Tetto past Saturday for one of my cousin's bachelorette parties, and I had no problems choosing beers throughout the night. Toward the end of the night, however, it seemed like they quickly ran out of several beers. Hours state that the bar is open until 2 on Saturdays, so I was a little bummed they ran out of a few beers we'd have liked to try. It was around 12:30 when we tried ordering both a Dogfish Sea Quench and another beer, and they were out of both.  Another thing I particularly enjoy here is the open roof. It's beyond cool to see the lights while you're standing on the outside balcony sipping on a refreshing and tasty beer. This last visit was on an evening that was particularly muggy and hot, and with as crowded as it gets here it can get uncomfortable. If they had a better ventilation or fan system to keep patrons cool it would help astronomically. On cooler and less crowded evenings, though, it's a great place to be.  Service is something that I'd say they have room for improvement on. It took a while to get beers to our table, and being here for around 3 hours I drank about 3 beers. Not bad for me, but I know some of my cousins were growing impatient with how long it took between rounds. I've had experiences here where it took a while to get our beers at the bar, and I can see why other reviews mention the service here. Aside from that, it's a neat bar and unlike others in the city. If you're a beer fanatic or just looking for a good spot to kill some time downtown, this place won't break the bank. I'd recommend it, but be aware of the crowd size!",

Getting up to Il Tetto is an awkward elevator ride up (after waiting in the queue downstairs depending on how crowded it is) ... and the same awkward elevator ride to get back down.   The service has never been great, but my most recent visit was by far the worst experience. The bartenders were flat out rude and seemed inconvenienced to even take notice of us as we sat at the bar. One of the bartenders aggressively grabbed the (filthy) menu from under my friend's arm as soon as we gave our order.  The entire staff was so wrapped up in themselves and their own conversations that they barely took notice of the customers. Safe to say I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon.",

Happy Hour specials include $5 drafts, frozen cocktails, and one other drink. The $5 cost for drafts isn't that big of a happy hour deal in my opinion, but getting a frozen cocktail for that price was great. The frozen cocktail was the majority  frozen wine and tasted very fruity. It kept cool in the metal glass they serve it in, so I didn't have to worry about it melting on the hot day. The atmosphere of the bar is relaxing and very pretty. There's a great view of the city, it's tendy, and definitely a place to socialize. I can see myself coming back here in the future.",

My friend got the crab and artichoke dip and I didn't really like it, but everyone else enjoyed the flavor. I personally thought it was a little spicy and you couldn't taste crab.

Can get table service but can be slower than going to the bar. I still opted for table service. There is food avail upstairs but I only saw a table eating a soft pretzel. Looked tasty from afar.  A few mix drinks; one being an Aperol Spritz. An Italian drink or a new Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fav depending on who you ask. (Feel free to judge my reality TV show watching & influence when trying drinks). The first & second tasted totally different and were served in different glasses. But why send it back?!   A raindrop hit my arm & before I could say, \"hey is it...\" a quick downpour started. This resulted in half the bar rushing to the other half that had a roof. Quickly the retractable roof was shut & the evening was saved. The staff was nice in getting towels to wipe down tables and chairs.",

    "text": "The third floor is the place to be. As long as it's not raining or the movable roof is broken. Then it gets a little hot up there on the rooftop. Both of those things happened to me during recent visits but I will say that it didn't stop me giving this place a four star review for their happy hour.  Their appetizers are half off and they have $5 drinks. This is an awesome deal for downtown happy hour and the atmosphere on the third floor is actually beautiful. We recently had a work happy hour here and it was awesome. Other than the roof not working. But we may do and got tables closer to the opening.  They do not have reservations for the third floor so it's just come one come all. But there is a lot of seating so it shouldn't be an issue to find a c or to find a place to set your drink if you do have to stand around a table. And the tables are pretty long so just pull up next to someone and make a new friend.  My favorite drink is a frozen rose there. It is refreshing especially on a hot summer day. And it is part of the $5 happy hour special so really you can't go wrong. My favorite snack is the carrot hummus with arugula pesto. I know it sounds super weird but honestly it is delicious and I keep on suggesting it to everyone including the people who are sharing our table not part of our group. The pretzels with the governmental cheese are definitely the second favorite on the list. The cajun fries are always going to be a favorite because fries are delicious and a little bit of spice is awesome. I didn't think like the brie as much as I wanted to or the artichoke crab dip. But I will say that on the Brie I did like the the fruit.  If you are downtown and want something interesting and different go and have a few drinks and appetizers on a rooftop bar. It is fun and a good way to pass some time after a long day of work.",

It's first come first served, except that all of the tables are always reserved.  If you try to sit anywhere except the bar, you are immediately rousted and told (generally not so politely) to move.  It's crazy crowded, especially when the weather is nice. Their occupancy limit is definitely at \"pack it in\" level.  There is usually a line to get up the elevator.  The bar is frequently three deep and always understaffed.   The drinks and the menu items are all overpriced - you are paying for the concept for sure.  And to boot, it's rarely a comfortable space.  The open air thing is great on the right day; but when that roof is closed, the temperature is way off.  And I notice that the sun is in my eyes a lot there.     Overall, I just don't love it.",

    "text": "Great idea - terrible execution. I came here per a coworker's suggestion earlier this month and found that while the space is lovely and the food tasty, the service was too horrendous to ignore.  One of the biggest drawbacks of Il Tetto is in the extended name - the rooftop garden. Don't get me wrong: if it's a beautiful day outside, this place strikes me as a great setting for a drink. Unfortunately we live in Pittsburgh and the common threat of rain meant that the garden went from open to covered during my visit. The noise level tripled and the temperature climbed when it did, making the place almost unbearable.   I stuck it out because I was really enjoying my drink and the food with my company. Their Pimms Cup cocktail includes fruit flavoring and ginger beer, not the usual combination in this drink. Their chocolate hazelnut marjolaine dessert was amazing, and both the spinach and buffalo chicken dips were fantastic.  Unfortunately, getting the food in particular turned into quite the challenge. Our table's waitress more or less ignored me after I placed my first drink order. My coworkers and I had to shout after her at one point because she would walk off before we had a chance to ask her for food or drink refills. Not once did my water get refilled during my visit, by the way. Fortunately I had a Pepsi in my bag to help combat both the room's temperature and the heat in the buffalo chicken dip.  The final nail in the roof garden's coffin was when I asked for my check. I figured things were moving slowly so I would ask for it early. Boy was my prediction spot on. I waited at least 30 minutes for my check (I didn't start a countdown until after I had been waiting some amount of time, so I only know it was more than 30 minutes). I even watched people who asked for their checks after me get theirs before I did. Oh, and I only got my check because I told a passing server how long I had been waiting.  I expect that I'll check out the other parts of Sienna Mercato in the future, but the rooftop garden did not impress me. Yes, the food and drinks were great. The place is probably lovely enough to visit when the place is open (although I suspect it's covered more often than not). But after that horrendous service I don't plan on returning.",

Now they're talking about \"chubby chasers.\"  Also some douchey looking guy tried to get my boyfriend to leave our table? Also because he doesn't weigh 90 pounds. Great place if you're 85 pounds tops. Clearly against overweight people.",

    "text": "If it were not for this being a rooftop bar and good for a bigger group of people I am not sure I would go very often. The space is great and I love being on the rooftop for the warmer months. But I am not overly impressed by their drinks. This is a happy hour spot, the space calls for it, because of that you would think that there would be more specials, or more signature drinks but that really is not the case. If you want a beer they have it, or a gin and tonic . . . it is not a problem. However, it does run on the pricey side and I always feel like the bar is a bit understaffed.  That being said, I will always be back on those warmer nights because of the rooftop. . . so that is a good call and compensates for the overall average bar experience that it would be without the space.",
