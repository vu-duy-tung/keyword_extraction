    "text": "Oh farfegnugen!  Alright - I have no idea what that means but it was a good night at the ole Hofbrau.  I ended up taking my engineers who were craving some German Food.    We put on our best yard gnome attire (atleast that is what it reminds me when I see shorts and suspenders) and took the drive down to Hofbrau.  We were quickly seated.    There was a gentleman who was quite good playing the keyboard and interacting with the crowd.   Many people were doing what appeared to be Ski Shots (shots done with a group that were on a ski).    Please note - if you are the shortest person in your group - you will tend to get wet.    I don't know why but what you think will be a casual shot will end up being a silly experience out of Nickelodeon.  The restaurant was not filled to capacity by no means but we had to wait 15 minutes before we were asked for our first beers.   In the waitress defense, she had 2 large tables.   After we received our first beer and put in our appetizer order we did not care.  Appetizer - I order the team the works - potato cakes, fried pickles, sauerkraut balls, and pretzels.   It was good but nothing to write home about.  Dinner - Bavarian Jagerschnitzel  a pan seared Pork Cutlet topped with a Burgundy Wine Mushroom and Bacon Sauce with Bacon Slices served with Cranberry Sauce, German Potato Salad and Chef 's Vegetable Selection.  My dinner was very good.   The pork was cooked perfectly, the sauce was tasty, and bacon will always be the perfect meat candy to any meal.  The Beer - I had the Oktoberfest beer (limited time) and Lager.  The beer at Hofbrau is always pretty good.  If you are in a group - this is the place to go.  I will be back but there are many local places I would rather go to in comparison - thus the three stars.   There is nothing wrong with the place - I am sure I will be back.",

It's worth driving 50 miles for. The strudel is straight from Germany and worth saving room for. Get the vanilla bean ice cream and you'll be happy.  If your only here for a day, eat here. Unless you just flew in from Germany.",

Had the sausage meal, it game with 3 different types of sausage, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. A meal that very filling and at a great price. The giant soft pretzel comes with 3 dips, cheese, stone ground mustard and a horseradish sauce. Atmosphere was very \"polka friendly\" with live music. I hear that it gets a little rowdy at late night. Well worth the visit !",

We got the Giant Pretzel and sausage platter for a starter.  Both were delicious.  The sauerkraut that came with the sausage was soooo good.  I made sure I got a side of kraut with my meal because of it.  The Pretzel was great too, and the sauces were phenomenal.  For my meal I got the pork.  The one i ordered was the Bavarian Jaugersniztwel.  It had mushrooms and bacon on top, and the sauce with it was absolutely great.  The sides were also good.  The waiter told me before that the veggies were frozen and not good, but I ordered them anyways, and I really enjoyed them.  The workers messed up my mothers sides, but they fixed it with no problems at all, and within sixty seconds, we had the new sides.  We even got to keep the wrong sides, which I was very happy to devour.    Everybody at the table liked their meals, and we even had enough room to throw down some apple strudel and chocolate cake.  They were both delicious.  I would defiantly recommend this place.  The atmosphere is beyond fun, and if I am excited for two birthdays from now when I get to spend my 21st Bday cheers-ing German beers and singing along with the rest of the place.",

    "text": "So even before moving back to Pittsburgh in October of 2010, I had the opportunity to experience the Hofbrauhaus... and I did not like it then.  So since I moved within a stones throw of the place, I have decided to give it many a chances to wow me in some regard to make me like it and want to come back (I mean, for the sake of convenience, it would be an ideal place to like more than we do).  After numerous attempts at at least liking it enough to come back once a month, I cannot even do that.    The main hall is obnoxious.... I guess I am getting old as I cannot stand how loud it is and it always baffles me how many smaller children and babies are there with their families... especially since I have seen people get rowdy at times.    The only way I will be back is outside in the warmer weather... I like to avoid the aforementioned hoopla.    The food (minus some of the apps) leaves little to be desired in my opinion.  With so many other better dining options in town, this is not somewhere I will go for a full meal.    Service is hit or miss... I often seemed to have more luck at the bar than dealing with a server.    The beer is good... and the prices are good as well for the quantities.... so I guess that should help improve the rating to at least three stars (that coupled with the beer garden).",

I also ordered the Hofbrau Hofbrau Dunkel beer (see photo), a 5.5 by volume. It had a nice full flavor, not to heavy and because it was made there it makes it just a little extra special...  We also had a pork sandwich on the table, a potato pancake, and a veggie burger... The fries are worth mentioning as well... VERY good!

I forget exactly how much a liter is, but it's less than $10, which is a steal for beer of this quality. All the beers are spot on, I've never sampled any of the food but it seems great for drunk munchies. Service is friendly and fairly efficient, even on crowded nights.  The crowd varies from rowdy college students to tamer, older groups, but it's never unpleasant and there's always seats to be had if you don't feel like standing with your beer. The outdoor area is lively yet relaxing during the summer, there's nothing quite like enjoying a stein (or three) looking out at the river and skyline.",

We went there twice (embarrassing?) - the first time on a weekend night. The outdoor seating in the back was perfect for drinks and pretzels/beer cheese. We were there for a few hours, and it was relatively uncrowded (although it's huge, so there were probably a lot of people there). People really do stand on benches and sing along with the band in the inside area, but if you are looking to spend time in a place where you can hear yourself talk, the beer garden was perfect.   We went back the next day for lunch, mostly because we loved the beer (the Oktoberfest is delicious) and we wanted to sit outside with a view of the river.  The food was heavy, probably not ideal for a hot summer day, but the rest of the experience was great.   The whole thing is a little kitschy, what with the \"authentic\" (?) Bavarian outfits donned by the serving staff and the accordion player strolling around the joint. And there was a significant influx of college age club-hoppers getting their night started. Also be prepared to get ID'd at every corner regardless of your age. But honestly, none of those factors affected our experience at all - we even bought a souvenir Hofbrauhaus mug to take home.",

We sat in the bier garden outside which has a wonderful view of the river. I'd never been to a bier garden before and it appeared to just be an outdoor area with picnic tables where you eat and drink. Excellent. I am a fan of outdoor dining.  They brew their own beer here and have several options they offer year round such as their premium beer, a light beer and a hefeweizen...they also have a seasonal beer each month.  The beers come in two sizes 1/2 Liter or 1 Liter.  We started off with the fries with bier cheese and bacon, which was so delicious!  For my meal I got the jager schnitzel which was basically a fried porkchop in gravy served with german potato salad and some veggies. After tasting the food here I see why the beers can afford to be so large. Everything was so dense, but I guess that's what german food is.  Overall this is a fun restaurant which seems like a place I would enjoy best just for some heavy appetizers and huge beers with some friends. So if your ever in the Pittsburgh area you should go! You'll have a good time.",

He not only sang German drinking songs but he entertained us with dancing music and even Russian music.  There was a nice little dance floor in front of the stage where my friends and I danced the night away... of course we sat down for the meal.  We had the potato pancakes... which were much better than the potato pancakes at another German restaurant in Pittsburgh called Penn Brewery.  I also got schwinenbraten (excuse my poor spelling).  I substituted the sauerkraut for apple kraut... a very good decision.  And had a pretty good bread dumpling.    I went to Germany last summer and experienced my boyfriends' family's homemade German cooking... so nothing really compares to that.... but the food was pretty good... I'd say about a 3.5 or 4 depending on what you order.  But the experience made the night a 5 for sure!  I also recommend ordering a liter to really make the experience authentic... if you're not a fan of beer (such as me) order a radler.  It's typically half lemonade and half beer.. but this restaurant offers that choice or half sprite, half beer.  It's quite good and allows even the non-beer drinkers the chance to join in the beer song fun!  In conclusion, go to Hofbrauhaus.... go with a group (ideally 4 or more) you'll have a blast if you're not afraid to join in the singing and dancing.",

Service and food were great.  This chain even brews their own beer on site and you can get it either in a liter or 1/2L.  Seasonal offerings are superb, even if some you can only get in 1/2L.",

    "text": "This is no more an authentic beer hall than the Tiki Lounge is an authentic Polynesian hut.  But the inside atmosphere is fun and energetic, with people dancing on tables as the band plays polkaized versions of Neil Diamond songs.  It is very very loud, with open seating after 9pm on weekends, so don't expect to have any conversations.  The outside is more chill and is a nice spot to sit along the river.  That said, the two stars are strictly for atmosphere only.  After 30 minutes of sitting outside went by with no one taking our orders, we had to chase down a waitress.  The beers are not-so-good.  The wheat is the only decent beer in the lot.  Instead of beers, I'd order a shotski--four shot glasses attached to a ski so all drinkers are forced to take shots in unison...Any shot you can imagine.  As far as the food goes, if you're not getting a pretzel, you'll be disappointed.  That's the only great item on the menu.  The sauerkraut is just awful.    The doormen here take their jobs too seriously.  I was startled by two of them yelling \"thief\" at me after I walked out with my group of co-workers.  Everyone around stopped to stare.  After the doormen said people had been stealing glasses, I showed them my left-overs from dinner were the bugle in my handbag.  The funny part is that I was stone-sober and didn't even order a drink there, so had no glass to steal.  I would have been willing to forgive and forget, but I never got an apology.  So I docked a star for poor service.",

The garden area as closed while we were there due to weather.  We tried the appetizer sampler and the Bavarian Sampler for 2 to split with 4 people. Both dishes were plenty of food. Appetizers  - Fried Pickles - I still haven't found one that I like. Sauerkraut Balls - they look like mini hush puppies with cabbage and ham inside.  Potato Pancake - texture is nothing like a pancake but looks like a fritter. Tasty. Pretzels - nothing special Sampler - Smoked pork chop is SALTY. Bleh! Sausages are delicious - though Hot Dog consistency. Schweinsbraten or roast pork - nothing special though I must say it was the healthiest of what was on the plate Strudel - Not sure if this is authentic but the strudel lacked any crisp to it and it was soggy and sad. I would not order this again. Beer - Buying 1 liter of Beer to get a glass is crap - almost twice as expensive as just getting the beer alone.",

We started with the beer sampler, five beers for $6.95. The beer is okay, nothing to brag about. We enjoyed the Octoberfest beer and the Dunkel.  We moved on to the sauerkraut balls. These things were awesome. If you are not offended by sauerkraut, you must try these. I then ordered the Hofbrauhaus Wurstlplatte and substituted sauerkraut for regular spaetzle. This is my third German restaurant and I finally found out the right way, how spaetzle is supposed to taste. The sausage was all very good. The wife got the Schnitzel Weiner Art.  The portion was huge so I was able to steal some of her food and it was fantastic. This place is great and cannot wait to return. We came for Judas Priest but loved the Hofbrauhaus...",

    "text": "It turns out I didn't need my 1 year of German to enjoy my evening here.   While I've never been to Germany (does a layover in Munich count) or a beer garden, I'm always looking for new places to try out when I'm in Pittsburgh.  My friend promised me that there would be lots of beer and boys, and that was all I needed to go.    We arrived on a Friday evening sometime after 9 and it was jam packed with people of all ages toting mugs of beer that were in some cases larger than their heads.  The only food we snacked on was the pretzels and beer cheese dip, which was really good.  Beer, not sure if it was locally brewed or imported, well it was fine but nothing to write home.  The band seemed to take a lot of breaks, but they were entertaining when they were performing.  Smart space.  I'm glad that restaurants are finally wising up and taking advantage of the terrific river front and opening up spaces for outdoor seating, which can be enjoyed a fair portion of the year.   I hope for the massive size of the place that the owners will find ways to prolong the novelty and that it stays open for a long time.  I agree with other reviews that it's best enjoyed with a large group of friends.  Probably not likely that I would return on a future trip.  I'm not sure if its the women scantily clad in Forever 21 dancing on the long wooden benches or the triple and quad shots of Jaeger served from a ski, but the experience didn't feel very authentic and it's not really my thing.",

The place is huge and on the river with an expansive patio in the back. Unless visiting at peak times, finding a table should be no problem.  Staff members are dressed in German garb and the music is loud, overall creating a small feeling of being in Bavaria.    As expected, the beer is solid.  With whatever type of beer you choose, I suggest going for the 1L mug as it is an awesome feeling to hold that mug filled with so much drink.  My favorite is the hefeweizen, a wheat beer with a citrus taste that is great in summer.  The food is great too from appetizers to main courses.  The pretzels are hot and soft with a real cheese dipping sauce.  There are lots of choices for entrees but one can't go wrong with a wurst platter.  Jagerschnitzel (pork cutlet with mushrooms) is another favorite of mine.  Great place for food, drinks, or both!  Go with a friend or a large group on a warm summer night and you won't want to say \"auf wiedersehen!\"",

Was it the food, no, I enjoyed the huge pretzel and variety of flavorful mustards to dip the perfectly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside offering was. The beer was fine if that was you next thought. I had a sampling of all their beers which were all different in their own rights.   I'm not a huge fan of the South Side Works, but that wasn't the reason either. It was in fact that this place was over run with college students and it's noisy. I don't dislike college students mind you, it's just that they tend to take over. As I age, the bars I want to frequent need to be quiet, peaceful and if there are Televisions they need to be set to sports or CNBC. Lol.   It's not the fault of this establishment that I don't like the place, it was just built too close to two major campuses in the Burgh.",

Speaking of the staff, they were friendly and helpful without being intrusive (thanks Kate!), although you might find the traditional costumes a bit much, especially in an era of heightened sensibilities. As for the atmosphere, I found the band very helpful to the overall vibe, but as others have pointed out, if you're looking for a quiet dinner/beverage, this probably isn't the best place for you - you'll definitely get much more out of this place if you're willing to buy-in and join in.",

I almost tried to talk him out of it because who wants to eat carbs and beer after going on a 2 mile hike??   The reason for this update is to let you know Hofbrauhaus has amazing salads! I was stuck between the Munich Market Salad and Cobb Salad. I decided on the Munich. It had chopped romaine lettuce, strawberries, mandarin oranges, pineapple chucks, dried cranberries, glazed pecans onion and feta cheese. I added grilled chicken for an up-charge (you can also add salmon). The dressing on the salad was raspberry poppy seed.   That salad was ^&%$#@*  amazing! So fresh, so filling and tasty. It went perfect with the light beer option (Hefe Weizen.. my fav!!)   They also offered a Pittsburgh Salad as well as a few other options.  ****You can buy 6 packs to-go.

We ended up parking a couple blocks away in a parking garage which was fine, but I would have been happier if the valet was all day and not just for the dinner hours. We were greeted and met our party near the back of the restaurant. The seating is just like you would find at an authentic Oktoberfest in Germany, long community tables. I was so excited to try the food and hoped it would taste like the food did when we lived in Bavaria. Of course we started off with some Hefe Weizen, goes down like silk. Smooth and sweet just like I remember it. We also ordered the Pretzel and Bier cheese app and the Works Combo appetizers for the tables. Loved the sauerkraut balls and the potato pancakes with the apple sauce were fantastic! That works platter would also be good as an entree, a little bit of everything. I went with the original schnitzel for my entree. A huge piece of lightly breaded pork, still tender and juicy on the inside with cabbage, buttered spazetzle(substituted this for the potato salad) and a side of cranberries. I had never though of having cranberries with pork, but it was an amazing accompaniment. Loved it! It was also a very large serving with plenty of leftovers to take home. My husband had the Hot Brown. No bread in this as it had the potato pancakes for the base, tons of turkey, gravy tomato and bacon. This was the perfect sized lunch meal. During our meal there was also a man playing an accordion so we had some live German music. Definitely want to come back here again. Great food, great beer.",

    "text": "Wow, wow, wow! This place was SO good. I've known Hofbrauhaus for their beer but not for the food. Also, I'd never had German food before this. Although I'm sure authentic German food is best eaten in the homeland, this was a great preface to it! The atmosphere of the restaurant was great. At the Pittsburgh location, be sure to sit outside when the weather permits it. There's nothing like a nice breeze and view of the river. If you sit inside, you'll be sitting family style. When I was there, there was a piano playing on the stage where we witnessed the entire restaurant burst into singing \"Sweet Caroline.\"  The schnitzel was moist and full of flavor. I don't really like cabbage, but the side was really delicious and flavorful! Get the pretzel and bier cheese for an appetizer! You won't regret it.   There's street parking throughout the shopping area, as well as a parking garage. However, if you're planning on indulging a bit, Lyft/Uber is a must.   Fan of good German bier? Drop by!",

    "text": "I go out of my way for German restaurants/bierhalls and I can say for sure that Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh is in my top 3 in the country.  I've been coming back to this place over the last decade and I can tell you that it's been solidly consistent in terms of quality too.  If you like German style beers, you can't go wrong with any of the options that they have on their menu.  From their traditional styles of year-round offerings (Munich Helles, Munich Dunkel, Hefeweizen) to the monthly rotating options, you'll never have a bad beer here. They have one or two rotating options that are on the hoppier side, but if you're the type of jagoff who refuses to drink anything other than IPAs/DIPAs/imperials, just go somewhere else.  Or consider the beers for their historical context and appreciate a different style that's well-executed.  There are few things more satisfying than the taste and heft of a 1 liter stein full of good quality German lager.    The food has always been fantastic here as well.  We always, as in 100% of the time, get the pretzels and bier cheese.  They are fantastic and are the perfect salty complement to your first liter of beer.  Everything that comes with The Works Sampler is also really good and it's good for sharing if you have 3 or 4 people. For my meal, I typically get the Wurstplatte and I've never been disappointed.  My only complaint about it is that I would rather that it come with a Weisswurst rather than the Frankfurter.  The Frankfurter is good, but I'd prefer the more traditional Bavarian white sausage. We've also had the Hot Brown and a couple of the schnitzels before as well and we've been satisfied with everything. I also recommend getting the Spatzle as a side.  I'd go with the buttered option, but the bier cheese Spatzle is also good, if a little on the heavy side.  I agree with some of the other reviews that talk about going on an off-night or earlier in the day if you are going on a weekend.  The wait can be pretty long Thursday nights-Saturday nights and it gets loud with the live bands.  If you're looking for a fun night out with friends, it's not a problem, but if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner date, go earlier on the weekends or on a week night.",

    "text": "We have eaten at the restaurant a few times and returned recently with a Groupon deal.  There were just two of us arriving around 4:30 in the afternoon but we were told 45 minutes due to a wedding party that had been dining.  It ended up only being about 10 to 15 minutes wait which was awesome.  Usually, we are asked if we would like to dine in the big room/hall but this time we were not asked.  They seated us in the other room (without the entertainment) and right next to the kitchen entrance.  I feel like maybe the door should be closed or something so that the customers are not looking at the serving staff entering and exiting the entire time.  We also would have preferred being in the other room but so be it.  The food was good but it is overpriced.  The portions for bigger meals are generous but we were not quite that hungry.  We ordered an appetizer (sauerkraut and ham fried morsels).  Very good!  My husband had the Hofbrauhaus Hot Brown dish and this was also very good. We ordered a side of the spaetzel which is simply phenomenal - it's one of my favorites!  I ordered one of the salads with fruit (Munich Market Salad).  I know that most people go to the restaurant to enjoy more traditional fare but if you offer salads, I would recommend using all fresh ingredients.  The pineapple on the salad was Canned Pineapple tidbits not fresh pineapple.  There were orange sections on the salad and when I bit into two of these, they had an 'off' taste, moldy type of taste.  Visually, they looked fine but I tried two pieces and experienced the same thing.  I bit into the third piece and had to spit it out because I tasted the same kind of taste.  If I was working in the kitchen, I would want to know this info.  I politely told the waitress that she may want to mention it to the kitchen staff that the oranges had a bit of a moldy taste to them.  I don't know if the cheese on the salad may have been a factor (moldy piece) and perhaps that is what gave the oranges that taste, not sure.....One of the managers then came out to address the comment. I appreciated the fact that they tried to quickly respond to a customer's concerns..  However, she proceeded to tell me that the chef had just opened the bag and had peeled that one and that it was very fresh.  She also said that he tasted one of the pieces that I had sent back and said that it was fine.  Now, if I recall anything about customer service, it does not involve coming out and insinuating that the customer was lying which is clearly what she did.  I had not asked for money off my bill, I had not asked for food, I simply had expressed that I thought the oranges tasted 'off'.  She then ended the conversation with an offer for a free side or something but at this point, I was kind of in disbelief and I just wanted to leave so I declined.  It really ruined what had been a fairly nice dining experience.  I would have given three or four stars but that simply is NOT okay to tell a customer - well we don't believe you and we think the food is okay???????  Despite the fact that we like the food overall, I doubt that we would return again.  Not cool!",

It's a large place, so it's pretty spacious considering how many people filter in. The live bands are OK, but it gets very kum bah yah-ish.    This is a place for you if you like live bands and lots of noise and people dancing on their seats. When it comes to night life, I am strictly for electronic dance music, so my review may not be 100% fair,  but it is True that I personally have experienced much better.

That wasn't a problem as our family was looking forward to this visit for a few months. We were seated at 7:30 and place our order rather quickly. Waitress said kitchen is running a little behind tonight at the time of our order but didn't really say what a little was. Turns out a little means over an hour and fifteen minutes until your food will get to your table. I hope they address the issues with the kitchen at sometime because it really used to be a fun place to go. Would not recommend to anyone until they fix the service.",

However, I really enjoyed eating at Hofbrauhaus with my coworkers at a conference. The atmosphere feels like a giant biergarten (or at least what I've seen in photos) and is very festive. There's a guy doing live accordion music at dinner that makes things feel more authentic as well. The service was a bit sparse (understandable given the immense size of the place), but friendly.   The food itself was delicious! The one letdown was the beer cheese pretzels. Everyone I talked to RAVED about them, but I found them to be incredibly salty to the point where I didn't really enjoy them, and literally scraped off all the salt from the pretzels. The cheese itself was ok. Seemed like standard bar fare. However, my schnitzel plate was fantastic! Perfectly cripsy, great cabbage sides, and really hit the spot. Overall, fun experience and I would definitely come back!",

It's a safe environment, there are security at every door so picking a fight in such a fun place will be difficult. The food was served hot and beautifully displayed. Our drinks served cold in ice cold mugs. Our server Nicole was sweet, friendly and was honest when telling us she didn't know how something tasted. This place is beautifully put together. They had live band that night and I got to dance on the benches and some others danced on the tables. The environment is just amazing! 5 stars to this place because of the place is clean, quick to serve us, friendly, food was unique, drinks where served chilled, and the music was top notch. A place to go with family, friends or both at the Same time!",

However, I have had their wurst and potatoes and that is wonderful too. They also have a great beer selection too! My favorite drink I've had there is their Oktoberfest. The best part of the Hofbrauhaus is their venue though. The inside of the building is the main restaurant/bar area which can get pretty rowdy at night. However, if you would rather have a quieter meal, you can go to the outside area which is picnic table style and overlooks the river. I went to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich a few years ago and whenever I sit in the outside area, I imagine myself being back in Bavaria!",

    "text": "This place is awesome. Hofbrauhaus is a must visit. I had a very good time, had some great beer, a nice traditional German meal and enjoyed the ambiance of 500 plus people having their time of their life.  My idea of a Beer Garden is good beer, good food, good signing and good fun. Hofbrauhaus was all this and more. As I walked in this place it was packed to the gills, but you were able to move around. Their was a wait for tables, Plan B the bar. After a few minutes, score bar seats. Let the fun begin; the beer:  Hofbrau Premium Lager was very good with 5.1% alcohol by volume. Lots of body. Nice finish.   Hofbrau Dunkel which was a dark beer with 5.5% alcohol by volume. Lots of flavor with a little spice kick. Also very nice. Lighter than most dark beers.  Hofbrau Hefe Weizen was fruity with a crisp finish. Very traditional and good. Alcohol at 5.1%  The beers were all good. They were easy to drink with lots of different characteristics. Very nice. At $5.50 a half liter, great price.  Ofenfrischer Leberkase - Thick-cut grilled pork and beef loaf topped with a fried egg and served with German potato salad. This was absolutely delicious. The pork and beef loaf was outstanding with great flavors. Never had warm German potato salad and it was a perfect compliment to the saltiness of the meat. Tangy, salty explosion of flavors. Yum. Entree was devour in less than 2 minutes; that is how good it was.  I realize that it was the weekend before Christmas, but this place was amazing with lots of fun had by a huge cross section of customers. It was as welcoming a place can be considering the huge size of the place. At different points in the evening the crowd would be signing along with the music. I know kichy, but FUN. Can't wait for a return visit and enjoy some delicious beer and food. Good job Hofbrauhaus.",

Took me back to the jaegerhaus we used to frequent in Lampertheim, it was well prepared with succulent cheese and ham and a fine potato cake. This was accompanied by a very nice dunkelweissen, rich but not overbearing. My only disappoint with the meal was my yearning for a doppelbach, but they didn't have any.

The food is a disappointing : everything seems to be breaded and deep fried and bland tasting. Even the German potato salad was lackluster. They might be better off cutting back on the number of menu offerings and significantly improving the quality of the food. Otherwise I suggest forget about eating here and just order beer and maybe a German pretzel or two.",

My recommendation, go to the Fatherland.  This place is just silly.  The costumes the women wear are absurd.  The beer is only OK and the food is yucky.  My friend and I ordered soups... which never came.  My friend ordered the steak salad and I some spaetzle dish that was supposed to have \"field mushrooms,\" Marsala wine, cream sauce, caramelized onions and chicken.   The mushrooms were basic and practically non existent.  The caramelized onions, if present, had disappeared into the cream goo entirely.  There wasn't even a hint of Marsala ... not a smidge ... not an iota.  The chicken was cooked to death.   I ordered a Hefeweisen to ease the pain and it was extremely herby tasting ... too much for my taste really... I asked for some lemon (yes you have to ask), and unsurprisingly, it too never came.  I elected to not drink the beer and try a dessert.  The strudel arrived in a sweet sauce with some raspberry flavoring.  It was piping hot because it was nuked into a pile of mush.  DISGUSTING.  I asked the waiter to remove the beer from the bill since I didn't drink it.  He had to ask the manager which seemed to bother him.  He took it off the bill.  The waiter was extremely handsome with a deep velvety voice and was the only fun thing (for me) about the experience.  Though his waitering could have been better his eye candy appeal was top notch.  Good place to people watch and drink, bad place to eat.  The appetizers sounded good but were crazy expensive for one person to order for themselves.",

The food was great as usual. We got the pretzels to share and they came out hot and soft! The service was great and we didn't feel rushed to leave even sometime after we paid. This is definitely one of my favorites in Pittsburgh!",

The beers in my opinion are nothing special & staff is just okay. I've never eaten here, so I can't review the food. Every time I have a beer or two here, I get a killer headache the next day. I typically just stick to mixed drinks, however, they don't serve those after midnight.  If you love wedding type music such as Shout, sweet Caroline and Don't Stop Believing, then you will love this place. They often have a live band that plays this type of music and everyone stands on top of the wooden benches and stings along. That, however, is not my thing. The atmosphere is cool is you enjoy, it's just not my style.  One thing I do like about Hofbrauhaus is the outside. If you are here in the summer, check it out. Over all, I think Hofbrauhaus is overrated, but others seem to like it a lot.",

The area around Hofbrauhaus is also good for shopping.  And then there was the beer.... So many German beers to try, so little time.... All I can say it that I'll have to go back. Hey, maybe I'll see you there...",

A local brewery and eatery, it Hoffbrau Haus offers a lengthy food menu, and many locally processed beers, and a few well-known national labels. Also included on the menu are monthly adjusted, seasonal beers imported from Germany. Pittsburgh is home to several locally brewed beer labels, \"micro breweries\" as they are often called. Hoffbrau Haus is uniquely designed to be both old-world cozy, and group-engaging. One can easily expect to be butted up against strangers with tankard in hand, singing German drinking songs, and yet having the time of one's life doing so.  Pros: local iconic establishment which is well run and maintains a single theme. The menu is diverse, with largely German fare. The comradery engendered in the early 20th century German pub theme is engaging. Cons: no easily accessible parking.",

I'm not exactly sure where this is located in relation to Pittsburgh but the location was really nice. Looks like all new development.  Since I've never been to anything German before, this was an experience. Although it might not be \"authentic\" it was pretty cool. The waitresses are dressed up in their attire and the tables are all wood. Gave me a Harry Potter feel.   Since we stopped by during lunch, we opted for their lunch buffet. I must say, unless you want something really specific off their menu, the buffet is the way to go! A few different types of sausages, a full salad bar with soup, and the usual comfort German foods. I loved their spicy sausage. Everything was great but I like that kind of food. Carbs and sausage! I saw that there is a location in Ohio too but it's 2hrs from me. I wish I could've got a beer but since I was driving and it was a company vehicle, I had to be responsible.  On our way back, I was tempted to stop here again but it would've been dinner time.",

I met up with some friends from other of town for Sunday lunch at 12:45 pm and we got seated right away. We didn't sit on the main dining room, but sat in the quieter dining room area where it was quieter and we could catch up. Perfect for families of all ages.   For an appetizer, we order the 4 pretzels with beer cheese. They were delicious and the perfect amount to share.    For my main course - I ordered the spaetzle with shredded chicken and mushrooms and a side of potato pancakes. I had never tried this before - but now it will be my go-to.   Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu - she suggested what beers for me to try.   For dessert- we split the cinnamon pretzel with cream cheese icing. I loved it and would definitely get it again.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at the Hofbrauhaus and will be back again soon.",

Figured it was enough time before a 7pm movie to grab dinner. Server arrived promptly and took our order. Beer and coffee came quickly, so did the pretzels and Bier cheese. An hour later and our food comes out. My wife's is piping hot. Mine is almost cold. We have never had such a bad experience. I almost gave a 1 star but the manager came and really apologized and was embarrassed. She took my meal off the bill and my beer. If it wasn't for her visit, I'd be really angry.

You can't beat the atmosphere here. My favorite is sitting outside at the bier garden. The main dining hall inside is always bustling, and it's a lot of fun. My son loves to dance to the music in the front by the band, and it's so cute to watch. If you're coming on a weekend, come early before it gets super crazy and check in ahead of time on the no wait app.   You can't come here without getting the pretzels and bier cheese. The cheese is to die for! I love the hot brown, and basically anything on the menu with bier cheese, but the hot brown is a potato pancake with smoked turkey, ham and bacon on top, drizzled with bier cheese. What's not to love? And I'm not a beer drinker, but I love the hefe weizen. It's a light, sweet beer, and the only beer I'll drink.",

A traditional German style beer hall with picnic-style seating and a few booths. Your best bet would be the upstairs balcony...NOT the downstairs gravel lot. I like when they have live ethnic music.  Service: not great, not bad. I feel bad that hey have to wear the cheesy get-ups.   Overall: a little overpriced and touristy, but a definite must-visit when in the burgh, however, if you live here, it's probably not your first choice.   Ps.

    "text": "This place is very popular especially among the younger crowd. But for me going here is like going to Disney world. Not because it's awesome but because when you go you remember why you haven't visited for 10 years. The main hall is EXTREMELY LOUD !  There is usually a live band playing polkas and people are seated at long rows of tables with people screaming to talk over each other and the music.   The food is okay. When we visited we arrived in time for happy hour (5-7pm) and saw on the website that to take advantage of happy hour pricing you had to go to the bar area. We asked the hostess if we could sit outside at a table and still participate and she said \"anywhere\" in the restaurant. But when we sat down at a table they said we were misinformed and would have to go to the bar if we wanted happy hour.   Outside there is a bar, and we had to belly up to get a limited selection of happy hour beers and pay a separate tab.   The appetizers were half price there.   The service was slow too. There was only one server (who was brand new) to cover too many tables.   Long story short, it will probably be another 10 years before I return and recall why I didn't go sooner.   IMO if you want good German food there are much better choices in da burgh.   Ps - there is no free parking. Either you have to valet for $8 + tip or find street parking or garage parking a block away and walk.",

When moving to our seats we squeezed through a tight hallway past numerous staff and customers wandering around with beers. It was -loud- but fun loud. I ordered a Hefeweizen to drink and was very satisfied - easily one of the tastiest beers I've ever had. It had a light fruity aftertaste which I loved.   We got the works sampler for an appetizer and everything on it was A+. The bier cheese was sooooo good, and I didn't want to share any of the potato pancakes. We also ordered the pierogie which came on a bed of fried cabbage with bacon and loaded with chives and onion tanglers and was amazing. For my entree I got the Wurstplatte; all three sausages were delicious, and the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut were perfect accompaniment. Best kraut I've ever had by a long shot.   Service was upbeat and attentive, definitely a great experience.",

Speaking of beers I am generally a fan of Hofbrauhaus' selection. The three standard selections (Lager, Hefe weizen and Dunkel) are all good (I have a particular love for the Dunkel). Be sure to check out the rotating specials. And if you aren't sure - ask for a sample or two (or three). The staff is great about this - they want you to enjoy your drink.  In terms of food: stick with german fare. Bratwurst, pretzels and such. Don't be surprised that Hofbrauhaus' salad isn't spectacular. Its a German beer garden, not Whole Foods.   Go with a group, sit outside on a nice warm day and drink a beer. Not much is better.",

    "text": "Stopped here on a whim because my son was craving schnitzel. It was a cool place - looked like a kind of commercialized German beer hall. The food wasn't amazing, but it was definitely good as far as chain-type restaurants are concerned. The seating was traditional. You are seated either at a booth with just your group or at a larger beer hall style table with other groups. You can also sit the bar. It was crazy hot when we were there, but I heard they have a very nice outdoor seating section as well.   The staff was nice, but it took forever to get our check. I'm not sure our waiter just had too big of a section, and I'm not sure if this was standard, but we probably waited at least 20-30 minutes until he came by to ask us if we were done. He was very personable though and was good with the pronunciation of the German dishes.   As far as the actual food was concerned, my son had the kiddie schnitzel which was definitely more than adequate in size. It would feed an adult for sure. I had the Bauern Schniztel which was great - particularly the Beer cheese it was covered in. I had the traditional sides - cabbage and potato salad and wasn't a huge fan of either, would probably try something else next time. We also started off with the pretzels with the beer cheese and were very surprised that they came out with three huge pretzel (with - in my opinion - too much salt). Beer that I had was great.   Best part of the experience was the live entertainment - accordion player in lederhosen. Very fun to watch. Overall a good experience - I probably would have given four stars if the service had been a little faster.",

Of course our group had to have the Pretzels and Bier Cheese to start.  The Saptzle and red kraut were good, so was the Sauerbraten but nothing special.   We were able to get an outdoor table overlooking the river.   The inside is very noisy and can be fun when there is entertainment. Our server was busy and seemed to forget about us at times, though we were not in a hurry and enjoyed lingering.",

They don't have many beers on draft, but they do have monthly beer specials and you can guarantee to find German beer here (go figure!). Service is dressed in something that resembles traditional German dress and are very friendly.   All I have to say about the food, though, is I've had better. We found out the pirogies are microwaved Mrs. Ts that anyone could buy at the grocery store. This makes me question everything else we ate there. We're the bratwurst Johnsonville? The French fries Oreda? Should I just go to the nearest Giant Eagle and make my meal myself?  The answer in this case is yes.   Good beer, microwaved food, in the future I'll just travel to Munich so I don't feel like I'm completely ripping off a culture.",

    "text": "Location Location Location.  90% of what makes Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh a lovely place to visit is it's positioning where the river meets the Southside Works. Noon, afternoon or evening, there isn't much that beats the atmosphere inside or outside of any Hoffbrauhaus but this location in particular has lovely view's of Pittsburgh and a stunning river-view terrace.  Everything is pricey but you're paying for the novelty of a traditional Bavarian style atmosphere. I mean hell, the waitresses wear costumes. SO that aside, the food is actually pleasantly tasty schnitzel and even not schnitzel. THe pretzels are a perfect snack, beer cheese on point and last but obviously not least the beer is just dandy. Little size is $5 and Big is $10. But big is a liter and is basically 3 drinks...two of those and you will find yourself dancing on the table(which is both acceptable and expected) to the house band playing various covers and favorites.   Go late for late night shenanigans or early for a hearty meal.  This place is just a good time. GO!",

    "text": "OK so I went here late at night at about 12 am on a Friday night right after checking out the Interview over at the theater across the st.  The security of this place is absolutely crazy, which makes sense given that when we went all the college kids were off from school, meaning party time.... which is basically what we walked into after showing our IDs to the bouncer. By this time the restaurant area was blocked off and it was just the main bar - beer hall area. They had a cover band playing what you would expect a band to play at a frat party all while wearing leaderhosen.  Most of the patrons were standing on benches and dancing around. Which in a way was kind of unexpected as I would think they stand when singing drinking songs not, Neil Diamon or AC/DC.   Anyway, we walked on to the bar and waited a few to put in our beer order. While waiting one of the patrons tried to cut in front of us, but fortunately the bartender noted this and totally blew the guy off for a bit. Also prior to making our drink order, the bartender asked once again for our ID. Given the high number of college/possibly HS kids I totally got it... and also felt bad for the wait staff as a lot of the patrons seemed just so douchey.  We got our beer right away which was delicious... what you would expect from Hofbrauhaus. Now as we were enjoying our beer we enjoyed the people watching, which was quite entertaining.    After our one beer, we left, as it definitely is not a place for conversation. More of a place to get trashed. Now, I really don't know if this is the normal scene, but I was not that impressed. I will also say we didn't try any of their food, which is something we plan to do when it gets warmer as they have really nice outdoor seating overlooking the river.",

But the unique atmosphere and the big beers as well as the excellent service inside the bar & dining area makes it totally worthwhile! There is a cute little gift shop inside.

The cheese tastes less like a german beer cheese and more like nacho cheese sauce, and I also wish it had mustard. All that said, it's still very tasty and hit the spot. They only have a hand-full of beers available, too bad, but there were some good ones in the mix. The best part is that they have a monthly rotating selection. I had to give it a try, and for August they offered the sommerweizer. It had that german beer flavor, just what I was looking for.   The real reason to visit this place is the huuuge outdoor terrace, with an upper section with waiter service and a lower picnic table area with drinking along the river. Really nice vibe and great views. Inside is also huge, totally different vibe with loud, live German music. The only real downside is that it is located a bit off from the main Carson Street stretch, about a ten-twelve minute walk from the rest of the Southside bars. Still, a cool spot worth a visit.",

    "text": "I continue to be a devotee of Hofbrahaus despite not being a beer-drinker.   Who cares about mead when such items as the titanically flavorful vessel of breaded, fried pork called the Schnitzel Sandwich are on the bill of fare? The lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles and bier cheese only compliment the flap of crisp, succulent pork held tightly within a Kaiser roll, making the foreign familiar and universal. The yinzer in me I had half a mind to ask for slaw and frites on top. Instead, the fabulous, dead-perfect Belgian-style tuber sticks came as a side.  I thought I tasted lard, which is always a good thing when devouring deep-fried foods.   The ultimate potato pancakes can also be had at Hofbrahaus. As thick as hamburger patties, they crackle like kettle chips on the outside, yet are plush, muggy, and starchy like au gratin spuds on the inside. So tasty were they, that I almost ignored the sour cream and applesauce that accompanied these precious, oily, crispy, shareable starters.   One must also consider the carnally creamy, benevolently bacon-laden comfort food tour-de-force that is the Hofbrauhaus Hot Brown...or Turkey Devonshire. No matter. You, the reader, the eater of good food, deserve such pleasures in an increasingly maddening world.   And dessert...praise Thor for dessert!  This time it would be the black monolith known as The Chocolate Stout Cake that would terrify my taste buds. Imbibed with yeasty, beastly, beery essences, the wedge of decadent darkness consisted of a frighteningly fudgy, dense body and an airy chocolate mousse frosting straight from Niflheim.  Is it touristy, ktschy, Epcot-ish? I am not concerned. The food makes its own statement, and that statement comes down bold like Mjolnir smiting mountains.   P.S. The service was terrific overall, and considering the restaurant had just opened for the day, we almost had it all to ourselves for most of our early lunch.  P.P.S. As Kay, her parents, and I gorged ourselves on the Teutonic delicacies, a gentleman in olden Germanic attire serenaded us with his accordion. Unfortunately, he knew no Blind Guardian songs.  P.S. The Hot Brown and the Chocolate Stout cake were specials and are not listed on the website's menu.",

I guess I've been spoiled, in terms of German food by Max's Allegheny Tavern, and my own Grandmother, because I've found the food at Hofbrauhaus passable at best. If you want a truly German food experience you'll find Hofbrau watered down, and if you're not into German food, but like the idea of a German Beer House then get the baby back ribs.  Okay, maybe the above was harsh, but in general I enjoy the beer and sitting in the beer garden during the summer. It's great to look out on the river have a liter or two of their Premium Lager and get some pretzels and cheese sauce. All in all, when I'm at South Side works looking to kill a few hours with some day drinking Hofbrauhaus has my back. Also, it's a great place to bring your country mouse cousin when they're in town.",

They were extremely busy so we went to the back area with outdoor seating and a second outdoor bar. It was packed! We waited about 15 minutes to finally find a group getting up so we could have their table. Service was a little slow but understandable since it was so busy at the tables. We were extremely upset with the outdoor bar. We waited about 15 minutes to get to the front to order our drinks. Once finally getting seats at the very front, no one helped us for atleast another 15 minutes. We were very disappointed by this, it was a little ridiculous. They were only helping people on the left and right side and completely ignoring the middle of the bar. Food and beer were good. There was a snake in the outdoor area that needed removed by a patron!",

The food is very Americanized German, and the atmosphere is so strange.  I ordered the Bauren Schnitzel ($16.95), which was a Pork cutlet with Ham and American Cheese.  Think a cheap version of chicken cordon bleu.  It was the waxy American cheese.  This was the kind of thing I would expect to get from a dive bar or cheap diner.  I also had a dark beer that, while dark in color, was not dark in flavor.  It was fine just not what I expected.  My dad was super unimpressed with his Weisswurst.  So food was a bust, beer was ok.  I think the low point came when at 6:00 pm on a weeknight people were plastered.  The waitresses were serving multiple drinks to people simultaneously, which is illegal.  Some creepy old man who was there with his TEN children was double-fisting liters of beer.  And he and his children spent the evening running through the tables.  The Von Trapp family with a drinking problem?  Guess that's what I get for eating fake German food.  If you just want to drink, go to the Beer Garden at a time children are not allowed.  Otherwise, skip the Hofbrauhaus.",

The buffet was all you can eat, and included a nice salad bar, and a small selection of German foods, such as schnitzel, spatzle, three kinds of meats including brats, a wurst, (and I forget the name of the other one), cabbage, sauerkraut, German potato salad, mashed potatoes, two kinds of soups, and rolls with butter.  The only thing missing, in my opinion, were potato pancakes (kartoffelpuffer).   The beer was not included in the buffet, and today I had the August brew, \"Sommer Weizen\" (5.6 % Alc. by Volume, which is a darker, maltier version of the Weizen bier with hints of banana and clove).  I enjoyed the buffet, but would probably prefer to order an entree off of the menu next time.  Today was the first time I sat outside on the veranda, and it was pleasant sitting outside, watching the river and people go by on the nearby river trail.  Nice place for lunch, but no live music today, I guess that is only for when the bier hall is full of people.  Prost!",

The beer is brewed in house... not a big beer fan, but I do like to have one while I'm here.  The mixed drinks were blah. The crowd ranges from 21 to 60's.  Mostly people dressed preppy... read guys wearing pink polos.  For dinner, I was only impressed with 1 time out of 5 times trying it. The schnitzel was the best! German potato salad also was good. The pretzels with beir cheese are overpriced, but good if you're in the mood for that kinda thing. Overall, I'm sure I'll be back, but it's not at the top of my list.",

    "text": "I went to Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh while visiting some friends on 6/6/15. I had an idea of what the experience would be like having been to the 1 in Munich Germany many years ago.   I am going to start with what I didn't like and then explain why I am giving it 4 stars. The restaurant is loud and I found myself screaming at my friends a couple of times so they could hear me. I am not sure if the spotty service was because our waitress was over taxed with tables or she gave us our space so we could continue drinking and eating. Either way, I would have liked her to check on us a couple of times more than she did. I would have liked 2nd drink but by the time she came around my friends wanted the check. The gift shop was also very limited with their sizes for tee shirts. I would have bought more souvenirs than I did if more was available.   However with all that being said it is a really fun atmosphere at Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh. The band although they made the restaurant loud, I liked how they encouraged people to stand up on the stools and toast. I remember when I went to Germany part of the fun of beer gardens is making \"friends\" with strangers by toasting each other. The cover songs the band played also were very good; and, I thought overall the quality of the music was truly professional.   The portions of food like the beer are HUGE and really good. My pretzel and salad were both so delicious I forced myself to continue eating.   In a nutshell not a great place to go if you'd like to sit down and have a conversation with someone but a really fun atmosphere and a truly unique experience if you're in the area.",

    "text": "If possible, I would want to divide this review into three separate portions: the food, the beer, and the atmosphere due to the fact each of these components would get a different rating from me. To sum up the food: 1.5 stars. I've tried several of their more traditional German items (Jagerschnitzel, sauerbraten, sauerkraut balls, and bratwursts) in addition to a few of their sandwiches (the Dunkel chicken sandwich and the pretzel sandwich) and have been very underwhelmed each time. It's always too salty, too greasy, and flavorless. I've tried some of the apps as well (sauerkraut balls and pretzels) and the pretzels, while they taste like those giant super pretzels you'll find in the freezer section of the grocer, are the only thing I will now order when here and only if I absolute need something to munch on with my beverage. The biercheese, again is overly salty, and was served practically ice cold on this last visit. We just used the regular old spicy Heinz mustard for dipping instead.   The beer, in addition to the atmosphere of the biergarten, is really the only reason why I personally come here. I would rate the beer at 3 stars. Out of their standard fare beers, I enjoy the Hefeweizen the most. I love the hint of  banana flavor and wheat beers are my second favorite (after IPAs of course!), and I highly recommend this option if you enjoy a wheat. It is perfect on a hot spring or summer day! They always have a \"beer of the month\" too, which happened to be a Maibock this month. I'm not really into the darker beers, and since that is mostly what is available here, I can't really comment on the darker ones myself, however my friends that enjoy darker beers rave about them, particularly the dunkel.   The atmosphere, particularly the outside Biergarten, is my favorite element of Hofbrauhaus. \"I don't like to sit outside on a beautiful day and enjoy a cold beverage\"-said no one ever! Or at least I hope no one ever......Anyways, it's beautiful near the river where you can watch the boats go by or people making use of the riverfront trail. You can also exit the biergarten right onto the riverwalk where the docks are located. Some of the tables have umbrellas which provided some much needed shade this past Sunday when it was 90 degrees outside! There are servers for the tables or you can enjoy watching a game at the bar, which is also a shaded refuge.   Just a note about my most recent visit this past Sunday afternoon. I went to use the restroom in the Biergarten and there was a female server literally having a melt down, screaming and swearing up a storm on her phone (to her mother since it was impossible to NOT hear her end of the \"conversation\" and I'm sure her mother really appreciated this on Mother's Day) about having to work out in the Biergarten and how she wasn't going to make any money because it was a Sunday, and she just \"couldn't do this anymore\". While it's not like this really bothered me,I just thought-obviously-it was extremely unprofessional to behave in that manner, particularly in the bathroom where paying customers could hear and see her. In this day of technology, I'm sure her whole cuss-word filled rant could have been communicated via text messaging. Just saying.   So in summary, come for the atmosphere, enjoy a beer or two, and I'd advise skipping the food in favor of one of the many other options in the South Side.",

The atmosphere inside is a beer hall, with all the accompanying noise and liveliness, but we chose the terrace because it was a beautiful summer evening, and we would have a view of the river.  The food is hearty, ample and amazing.  For starters four of us split \"The Works\" sampler, which I highly recommend:  soft pretzels with beer cheese, potato pancakes with applesauce, fried pickles with ranch dressing, and sauerkraut balls with honey mustard.  Whoops, just had to wipe the drool off my keyboard.  Wursts, schnitzels, and meats oh my.  The fare is pretty authentic German with a few items thrown in for the hipster or pickier eaters in your group.  Not surprisingly there is a great beer selection.  A fun place to go.",

I had the house brewed Hefe Weizen and Sauerbraten and Apple Streudel for dessert.  I'd highly recommend this establishment.",

    "text": "My aunt and sister Vi and I recently went to this place and it was our first time. We were impressed by the ambiance (the giant dining hall, the waitresses' traditional German costumes). The huge dining hall was quite loud so that may be a bit offputting for some, but I enjoyed the lively atmosphere. It may seem odd for teetotalers to visit a German bier (beer) house, but we came for the food. And what delicious food it was! Wunderbar. I got a cheeseburger with fries and bier cheese and pretzels as an appetizer. I was shocked that they gave us 4 huge pretzels! When my mother and aunt went there last year they only received 2 pretzels. So good job guys. Vi said her potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce were delicious (I can verify since she gave me a bite!) and my aunt enjoyed her generous Munich salad. Note that the more authentically German foods cost a bit more (around $18 to $22 per entree). Maybe next time I'll try the saurbrauten.",

You get them in huge classes that you can keep as a souvenir if you want to pay for them.  Onto the food.  Hofbrauhaus has my favorite pretzels and beer cheese around.  The pretzels are cooked perfectly and the beer cheese has a smooth cheesy flavor which pairs perfectly.  For main dishes, I always go with their various bratwurst options.  Can't go wrong with any of them, especially if you get it topped qith their house made sauerkraut.",

She suggested this place because we both have a common love for beer (thanks to going to school in Wisconsin) and needed some good hearty food after a long, sweaty day in the dorms.   I loved the wide selection of beers-both foreign and domestic-that came in 1/2 and full liters. Very authentic. The inside of the restaurant felt like I was back in Berlin with the long bench-tables that could fit a solid crew. There is also ample outside seating which has beautiful views of the river.   The food was pretty good-nothing outstanding but the atmosphere made up for the average meal.The service was also extremely friendly and made you feel like part of the family.

Overall was a fun experience, but a re-evaluation of their spice blend in their sausages would be needed for me to try their Frankwursts, Bierwursts, and Bratwursts again.  Things I liked: - incredibly friendly, welcoming staff. This is always a huge plus to any dining experience! - Seating for all kinds of environments: relaxed, mellow outside and lively, full of excitement insight the hall. Have your pick! - We ordered a pretzel that came with 3 different kinds of dippings. Their in-house beer cheese, which was a savory rich cheese dip. My friend most enjoyed the honey mustard. It had a fresh bite of that mustard flavor, which was very refreshing. Lastly, we had a pinkish dip that was quite salty, savory, and rich. It reminded me of salmon spread, very interesting and delicious! The pretzel itself was enormous, well-salted and fluffy. Definitely a great appetizer. - Our three sausages came with a bed of sauerkraut, creamy mashed potatoes, and a drizzle of gravy over the protein. Both sauerkraut and potatoes were amazing!  Things I didn't like: - Perhaps a little more gravy. It was so good the lack thereof was a bit disappointing. - The sausages had overall great texture: biting into each of them was met with a satisfyingly crisp snap of the outer seal. However, I felt that they all were quite generic and could be improved with a more exciting blend of spices. What to put in? Who knows, but something that doesn't remind of me Canadian ham, breakfast sausage, or a hotdog.   Overall, a positive dining experience that was just short of something more memorable. I would be excited to try the other entrees off their enormous menu selections, but I'll have to hold on the -wursts.",

Again, I just go for the beer and I end up having a good time. It's one of the few restaurants that take advantage of the riverfront and for that I'm eternally grateful.",

The patrons: loud, and numerous, especially on the weekends at dinnertime and beyond. I always enjoy coming here, though we don't come here that often. Compared to the rest of the chain joints in this part of the South Side, I'd definitely call this one first choice--even if it's just for the people watching and a heavyweight Dunkel.",

It's a huge building and the portions are also huge (so share or bring a crowd).   The pretzel and beer cheese were great. The wursts were quite yummy and juicy. The bread dumpling was slightly too dense and dry. The pork roast was also a smidge dry, but maybe these items are better on other days. The apple strudel was similar to the one in Munich, but I can't put my finger on it...it wasn't as good (maybe the layers were too soggy?)    Please don't come here to get a hamburger...there are a ton of great foods to try.  Prices were good and the overall experience was great.

The staff is also a blast. From the rocking house band, to the polite wait staff, to the imposing security, everyone is nice as can be. Get up and jam. You can dance on the benches until your legs can't hold you up, but stay off the tables.   I recommend this as a stop anytime you visit Pittsburgh.

    "text": "Whew. Wow. So, lemme get right to it.  I went to college in Pittsburgh but moved away from the city in 2010. When this place opened, it was THE PLACE to go on a Friday or Saturday night. The music, the big tables, the big beers, the bier cheese pretzels....  Flash forward to last month when I was back in town for a college friend's wedding. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night with two other friends. The weather was nice, and we opted to eat outside. The place was already pretty crowded, and it was only about 5:00 or 6:00pm. I'm not big on German food, and I ate here a couple times in college, but I had never gotten the ham and cheese sandwich on a pretzel bun, which is what I got this time. Wow! What a great sandwich!!!  My meal was really good. The boys ordered a little too much food for themselves and couldn't finish it all, but we all ate a really good dinner. My boyfriend, who had never been to Pgh, LOVED this place.  After dinner, we stayed for quite awhile, and as the night progressed, we felt so much more out of place! We definitely felt like the old people in the place, and we're only in our late 20s!  I guess in the recent past, Hofbrauhaus has gotten into trouble with how they serve their alcohol, so they've gotten REALLY strict about when they'll serve you another beer, and they DON'T do shot skis anymore. We were ID'd when we walked in, by our server, and each time at the bar, too. We didn't get angry about it, though, cause we definitely saw some people that we gave questioning looks--they looked like college freshmen...  Anyway, we had a great time, but we were all much more sober than we EVER were when we came here in college, so that's why I only gave it three stars this time. I guess it'll just never live up to the memories I have here in 2008-2010 :-)",

The first time I visited this beer garden was when I visited the original one while on a beer garden crawl in Munich.  Beer was great.  Meat was great.  Truly memorable experience in Germany.  Now that I've been in Pgh since summer of 2013, this Pgh branch has not disappointed me at all.     Food (8.0/10) = Seems like not many people like the food here.  I personally love what I've ordered.  1. Bavarian Jagerschnitzel = flattened pork smothered in mushroom, bacon, and gravy.  2. Oktoberfest Schweinshaxe = big fat ass pork shank with crispy crackly skin.  ?Beer? = duh.  Hofbrau Hefe Weizen and the Hofbrau Dunkel.  1 L.  No BS with these beers.  Ambiance (9.5/10) = The beer garden is very close to the river.  I havent been in Pgh long, but I don't know any other place with outdoor seating along the river.  The garden is the best.  Has a \"community\" feel to it.  Haven't spent much time inside yet since weather has been good, but looks like a party is going on every time I walk thru.  Service (8.0/10) = Good service.  I get my beer and food.  That's important.  Overall Opinion = Haven't been disappointed by this joint at all.  The best asset of this place, other than the beer, is the beer garden.

It is a menu of avoidance not replacement.  It lists things that naturally have no gluten rather then gluten free products shaped in.  Sorry no GF beer but they have other drinks.  Load but quite out side on the terrace.  It is heated but drafty so bring a sweater if you want sit out there.",

We ordered, and my 30 year old brother, his 29 year old wife and I (25 years) were asked for identification. My parents were with us and were not carded. We told them we were biking so we didn't have our wallets, and told them our ages, and our dad confirmed we are adults. The waiter wasn't having it. My dad said, \"okay cool we'll just get liters then\" and the waiter took the order without comment. My parents shared their liters with us, and the manager came out and said \"though I can see that you are old as you say, I'm afraid we cannot serve you alcohol and have to ask that you not drink any.\" So much for an authentic German experience.  Also the food's gross.",

    "text": "Hofbrauhaus is definitely a novelty restaurant and not somewhere I would frequent.   The environment is interesting where they take on the full atmosphere of an old German beer hall. I don't even know what those would be like but I imagine that it's most similarly like this. The women were clad in scantily short skirts and dresses that really highlighted their boobs. I don't think anyone could have been safe from those...  Anyway, the food. My friends got the Dunkel Bourbon Chicken and Schnitzel sandwich while I got the garden burger. First of all, it was hard enough trying to find something on the menu when everything was unpronounceable. The food itself was okay, the garden burger wasn't my taste because it seemed like they tried to put a mexican-style spin on it while still trying to keep the german flair. My friends seemed to enjoy the Schnitzel and Bourbon Chicken but the mashed potatoes were nothing special and she left the entire thing on her plate.   Overall, I would definitely take someone here purely for their aesthetics but probably wouldn't come here anytime otherwise.",

They have live entertainment (on most days I think) in a wide open seating area.  If you want something a little more peaceful, the patio is nice and has a decent view over the river.  Pretty much everything on the menu is either meaty or deep fried so this is not the place for trying to eat something light, but as long as you are not, everything is delicious.  If you have people to share with and plenty of appetite, the sampler plates are a good way to try a variety of foods - they have them for appetizers, wursts, and entrees.  The beer is great too, and comes in 1 liter steins (they also have 1/2 liters, if you don't want that much).  With tasty German food, beer, and a unique atmosphere, Hofbrauhaus is definitely worth a visit.",

It's not the best experience for us at night here.  So a few years back we came her during the day and it was great.  So when we visit Hofbrauhaus we usually come here early afternoon so we can soak up the sun, enjoy each other, take some cool pictures of us outside, and drinks some liters of beer!       I'm a wheat beer type of guy so I'm in heaven when I am here.  I'll drink their Hefe Weizen any time of the year but it' summer so I had their \"Sommer Weizen\".  This is just a great summer wheat beer.  Smooth, great color, great summer taste that is very enjoyable.  I wouldn't drink this one all year round if it was offered like the original Hefe Weizen but it's great for the summer.         Our favorite seasonal beer here no doubt is their HB Oktoberfest.  I would drink this one all year round.  We were a little early for this one because it should be available in September.  I hope we can find sometime to come back for that or I'll just have to pick some up at a store no doubt.       My rating is purely for the beer and the day time setting outside.  The bartenders and service was good.  I like the restrooms and they are clean.  Don't get me wrong about the night life here.  I like it here at night but it's too busy for us.  Were getting older we need some more peace and you can find that during the day.  We have never eaten any food here so I can't rate that but it's always tempting.  We just usually throw back a few here, take some cool pics of us drinking a liter of beer, and then we go to dinner somewhere else.         Come here on a warm sunny day, sit outside, get a liter of beer and you will have a great time here at Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh!",

I also ordered the bourbon chicken and it was just ok. Nothing special actually it tasted like something from Friday's or Applebee's. I also got the Octoberfest beer that was good.  The group I was with ate in the beer hall. There's usually a live band dressed in German garb. But the real entertainment is watching all the people that stand up on the tables to sing while raising their beer mugs!   I'll come back for a beer and to people watch but skip the food.",

Everything was prepared to order and perfectly cooked. Several beers are brewed on site, and I tried the Hefe Weizen wheat beer. It was served ice cold in a tall glass, and has a fresh bright flavor with a citrus note. I enjoyed it the beer so much, I got a 64 ounce growler to share and enjoy at home.

Because I was in town to assist a family member go to the hospital, all I could do was go for takeout. First impressions about the ambiance, when you step inside you kinda feel like your in a dream... you see the vats they use to make beer, wooden interior, german music, and pretty waitresses in german outfits. Went straight to the menu and ordered a pork shank and  breaded pork chop. While waiting for the order, people and families were all smiles enjoying their beers and meals. When it comes to food, they both tasted great, though i strongly recommend the pork shank! The saurkraut and coleslaw delicious.  I just wish driverless cars existed already so I could try out their beers as well before driving back.",

But I've been over Germany, HofBrau Munchen a few times, and other \"German\" places like Penn Brewery.  Nothing comes as close to the raw bar food feel you'd expect from the sister brewery to the original in Munchen.  Ja, it's touristy, but it's also homey.  Their beers are an obvious must Desserts are old traditional selections Main course items to try that are authentic Bavarian are the:  Weiwurt - peel the skin off and enjoy with light mustard.  It has a light, enjoyable flavor. Knusprige Schweinehaxen - it's a whole pig knuckle meant for two or three people.  (Emphasis on the multiple serving size). Anything with Spatzle - German thick egg noodles served with beef tips or chicken.  I visit with my family every year and every year they never cease to satiate our longing for traditional German food.",

    "text": "I have to be honest: Hofbrauhaus is just not my kind of place. The noise levels alone are enough reason for me to keep my distance. But, a friend really wanted to come here over the weekend to enjoy lots of German food and a side of beer, so I came with an open mind, good company, and an empty stomach.  As I mentioned, the noise level here is not kind to the ears - chatty patrons and (some admittedly fantastic) live performances alike make the volume almost overwhelming. This is not a place to come with a large group or anyone you want to have a real conversation with; you won't be able to hear anyone who's not next to or across from you. I'm admittedly not a fan of the seating here either, as the long tables and long benches ensure that getting up and down if you sit anywhere other than the very end of said tables and benches is not easy.  Once I'd sat down and committed myself to staying in that seat for the duration of the visit, it was time to decide what to order. My group started off with a pretty phenomenal appetizer. It was a sampler with multiple sauces (including some outstanding bier cheese), pretzels, fried prickles, sauerkraut balls, and potato pancakes (with applesauce on the side, of course!). Everything on this sampler was perfect and amazing and delightful. I'm not even usually a fan of sauerkraut, and I enjoyed the fried sauerkraut balls that came with this order.  On to the main courses; I opted for the Munich Market Salad because healthy eating and all that (I know, not exactly the place to go for the healthiest meal - had I mentioned a friend wanted to eat here?). And it was a fairly fancy salad - lettuce, strawberries, cranberries, pecans, pineapple, oranges, feta cheese...a pretty good combination, I'd say. Unfortunately, I also ordered the glazed salmon to top it. That extra salmon cost $4.99 - and as my picture proves, my salad came with the tiniest piece of salmon I've ever seen. I admit, that disappointed me, especially compared to the amount of meat on my friends' various orders. If decimal points were allowed, this surprise would definitely be reflected in my final star rating. But, decimal points are not allowed - and I primarily ordered a good salad, and a good salad was delivered to me. I actually intended to eat half of it and take some home for the next day...yeah, that didn't happen. I enjoyed it all right then and there.  So clearly my experience was up and down, but at the end of the night the downs weren't deal breakers. Like I said, I came with an open mind, and while Hofbrauhaus is not my kind of place, my experience and meal overall was just fine (although I certainly won't be ordering salmon on a salad again here). I admittedly won't become a regular patron any time soon, but I can appreciate why people like it and I won't tell people to avoid it entirely. If I'm asked to return again, I know I would enjoy exploring more of the menu. (And if nothing else, now I know that you can buy growlers at the bar here! Yes please!)",

I went for dinner with my family on a Saturday, and it was only a few minute wait for a table outside. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable on the food and beer selection, and all food and drink came out quickly!   I ordered the hefeweizen to drink, and the hot brown for dinner. The beer is honestly pretty strong, so if you aren't a huge drinker, you may need to prepare yourself for a little buzz. The hot brown is usually the standard choice for me, because it is basically a potato pancake smothered in cheese. It's very good, but very rich.   There is usually a German band playing inside, so it is always a little too loud to converse with the people at your table, so I prefer to visit this establishment in the summer. This isn't somewhere I would want to go to every weekend, but it is nice to go and get a different experience like once or twice a year.",

I was pretty excited to hear about the recent opening of the Hofbrauhaus in the ever expanding Southside Works development.  This place is absolutely massive.  I'm not exagerating when I say that they can probably fit 1000 people between the two indoor dining rooms and the two huge patios.  The long wooden benches in the main dining hall are simply designed for mass, communal consumption of beer.  And really, that's what you want to do here.  Hofbrau beer is served in half liter and full liter glass steins, and it is good.  My favorite is the hefewiesen (wheat beer).  It's one of the best hefeweisens I've ever had.  I also tried the seasonal Maibock on my most recent visit.  It had nice body, but at over 7% alcohol by volume, you're not going to finish too many liters of this before you hit the floor.  The Dunkel (literally, dark beer) was also good.  I don't know if they serve it in the main dining hall, but I'm hoping that they serve beer in the 2 liter glass \"boots\" that they sell in the gift shop.  Back in the day, when I used to live in Madison, WI, there was a German beer hall called the Essen Haus that used to serve beer in these two liter beauties.  There was a game we played with the boot where everyone at the table would take a drink and then pass it to the next person.  If you passed it on, and the next person finished the boot, you had to buy the next boot.  From what I can recall, it was a good time...  As for the food, well, it's German...  If you like wienerschnitzel, bratwurst, and sauerbraten, then you'll be in heaven.  Personally, I find German food heavy and bland, but that's just me.  The pretzels and beer cheese were a great appetizer.  Perfect beer food.  One of my dining companions ordered the \"Hot Brown\" (Turkey and swiss cheese over a potato pancake, covered in beer cheese and, oh, yeah, bacon).  It was really good, but dense.  In summary, go here with a large group of beer lovers and drink yourself silly on good (reasonably priced - $7/liter) German beer.  Fire down a few pretzels to soak up the alcohol.  Das ist gut.",

    "text": "It's Like Epcot Center in Pittsburgh, but with Better Food  Yes, this is actually a German beer house here in Pittsburgh at the South Side Works.    The Brau Haus and the neighboring Cheesecake Factory compete for the title of gaudiest architectural monstrosity on the South Side.  It looks like a little beer house plunked down next to the Mon.  When you arrive, you have two choices:  The quiet (read:normal) dining room, and the big beer hall.  We opted for the latter, and were glad we did.  In the big room, your sat next to strangers at big, heavy eight-seater tables.  On one side of the hall, performers in leiderhosen (yes, leiderhosen) play accordions and sing German drinking songs for your enjoyment.  Every so often, the performers call a toast, and everyone in the hall raises a glass and half-sings some German toast song.  It was actually pretty cool, and not that different from Oktoberfest in Munich (or what I remember of it anyway.)  My partner and I split a combination plate ($30), which was more food than either of us could even think of finishing.  It consisted of 2 pork chops, 3 sausages, 3 pork cutlets, mashed potatoes and two kinds of sauerkraut.  The combination plate was a good way to sample some exotic fare without really committing to anything.  We only wished it came with less sauerkraut and more green leafy veggies.  We didn't even come close to finishing the dish, but I still left feeling ten pounds heavier.  There's a reason Germans are so um.... zaftig.  Other (non adventurous) customers near us ordered salads and burgers.  They looked pretty good too, actually.  So you can bring unadventurous/picky eater members of your family to the brau house without fear.    Good luck spelling this place in Web searches.  (Key Words: Brau Haus Hoff BrauHaus)",

We had no idea what we should be doing when we first went in because no one was at the host/hostess stand.  We walked into the bar area and sat down and were ignored by everyone staff member walking by.  I finally asked a waitress if we could get service. She said no, because we weren't officially seated. What?  Are you kidding me???  We got up and went to the host stand and the guy there was an idiot.  He said we can't just seat ourselves, as if that's what we wanted to do or something!  I just wanted someone to pay attention to us. Well guess what?  He sat us in the exact same room as where we originally sat, but in a different spot not far from the original table.  Now does this make sense??  The food was OK, but there's not much enjoyment you can get from the food when you've been aggravated for 20 minutes just to get seated in a fairly empty restaurant.  That's too bad.",

It might be because it's definitely nothing like traditional American potato salad so if that's what you're in the mood for, this definitely is not similar. The sauerkraut is the BEST sauerkraut I've eaten. I would most definitely eat a bowl of it alone.",

Their bier is SCHEISS.  FURCHTBAR.  It's going to impress you if you've never had actual German beer.  I have.  It just doesn't taste right.  The best brew of the bunch is the Witbier.  Try ordering the Radler beeer, which is the wheat beer mixed with lemonade.  It's very refreshing.  If you enjoy sodium, you will LOVE the food.  Everything here is way too salty.  I think it's so they sell more beer?  Or maybe it's just bc I've quit smoking, now I think everything is salty.  I will fight you over the beer cheese pretzel.  It's pretty damn good.  Also, the Hot Brown looks a little iffy on the menu but my friend ordered it and she said it was fantastic.  .  Be prepared to losen your dirndl and let your Lederhosen out bc the portions are HUGE.  The caloric value of the food would probably be horrifying.  You can just drink your way through your diet guilt.  The service is usually fantastic and the food does come out quickly  Don't come to the Hofbrauhaus if you've had a bad day at work and need to vent to a friend--I made thie mistake of doing this and this is how I learned that the most annoying sound in the world when you're stressed out is that of an old man attempting to yodel.

It would be a great place to sit at in the spring/summer when you can enjoy the breeze and look out over the lake.   When I looked at the menu, I didn't even bother trying to pronounce the names because I knew I'd butcher it and embarrass myself in front of the server. I pointed to the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten, which was pork roast with a potato dumpling and sauerkraut, while my boyfriend got the Schnitzel Weiner Art, which was breaded pork cutlet with cranberry sauce, potato salad, and cabbage. Both dishes were delicious and the meats were just really tender and flavorful. I loved the potato sides from both dishes; the potato dumpling was really savory and flavorful while the potato salad had soft chunks that had a sweet tinge to them.   You have to end your meal with the Apfel Strudel (apple strudel with vanilla and raspberry sauce ) and vanilla ice cream on the side.  It's not too heavy and it's great to share with someone else!

I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I could easily drink a liter of Heffeweisen here. With its smooth finish and perfect hint of banana, I would highly recommend it.  I love starting with the beer cheese and pretzels. I could eat their beer cheese on a absolutely anything. The pretzels are perfectly salty, and the beer cheese is creamy with just a hint of tartness. The fried pickles are also a delicious starter.  For entrees, I love the bauern sandwich. It comes on a pretzel bun and is smothered with beer cheese. The beer cheese chicken is also delectable, as are the schnitzel options and buttered spaetzle.  If you are looking for a loud ambience, sit in the main dining room and experience live music as well as people dancing on the tables. If you are looking for something a bit low key, sit outside in the heated patio area. When the weather is nice, it's fun to experience the beer garden where you seat yourself and enjoy the beautiful view of the river.  If you still have room left, the apple strudel is really delicious. If you're looking for a fun place to try with friends, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I enjoyed our experience at Hofbrauhaus.  We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30 so the cavernous restaurant seemed very empty.  We were quickly greeted and our request for a table inside but with a view of the river was accommodated with a smile.    We started with the \"Works\" sampler.  Because it was slow in the restaurant, the food came out much more quickly than we had expected it to.  It was tasty and quite a bit of food.  However, it cost more than either of our entrees did.  The pretzels were the standard soft pretzel.  The bier cheese, however, was fantastic!  I wish they would have given us more than just the small cup worth.  The plate also included fried pickels (which were pretty standard as well).  What stood out wer ethe sauerkraut balls (served with honey mustard).  They were unique, crisp and tasty.  The combo was rounded out with potato pancakes served with applesauce.  While I enjoyed the potato pancakes, I expected better from a German restaurant.  Main entrees were the Jagerscnitzel and Kasespatzle.  The Jagerschnitzel is pork with a wine mushroom/bacon sauce.  The pork was tender and the breading crisp and tasty.  It came with a delectable German potato salad and a fried cabbage that I can't say much more about other than \"meh.\"  The Kasespatzle was, as expected, very heavy (the dish contains swiss cheese, onions nad heavy cream sauce).  It was too much for my taste, but my fiance loved it.    While we were dining, a leiderhosen clad accordian player kept the small crowd entertained with traditional German favorites with the Chicken Dance thrown in for good measure.    Overall, we had an enjoyable and tasty experience.  Hofbrauhaus certainly won't be a regular stop, but we will visit again.",

    "text": "There's not too much mystery as to what the Hofbrauhaus is at this point: huge, rambunctious beer hall with German and Not-German-At-All food offerings.  So I'll just offer a couple of thoughts to optimize your 'Haus experience:   1. Outdoor seating is great on warm days/nights.  So what if the Mon River is often sludge brown?  I still get mad at how criminally undeveloped Pittsburgh's riverfront is.  This is one of precious few spots to actually hang out by the water and I'm a fan.   2. The Weizen is legitimately great.  For beers like this, freshness is everything, so getting bottle versions from Germany definitely lose something on the trip over.  And for whatever reason American microbreweries haven't really mastered this style.  So this is a legit German recipe and it's fresh.  Short of going to Munich it's hard to get better.   3.  Definitely recommend the monthly keg tappings.  Fun time and you get to try out the new offering for free in addition to seeing how they used to do kegs in the olden days.",

The servers who were assigned to wait on my guests were very gracious, fun and made the evening go very smoothly.  I don't have one negative thing to say about my experience hosting a party here.

I'm sure some people love it, but it's just not me.  I've spent a lot of time at this place, and you should definitely go here if you haven't been here, just be prepared for LOUD.   I highly recommend you go in the summer and head straight for the back...the downstairs patio outside is a great way to spend a summer evening.  A year ago I probably would have given them 5 stars, but nothing has changed and it gets stale after a while.  If you haven't been here though,  you should absolutely go...there's a reason there are so many reviews.    As far as food, I echo Rachel's sentiment:  TGIFridays but with German food.  The food doesn't do it for me.  Definitely a drinking spot only.    On to the things I do like...the 1L of wheat beer, and the beer cheese + pretzels.  You should get a liter of beer because, well, you can't get it in many other places.  And yes, it is brewed in haus.",

I got their February seasonal beer which was the \"adulerator\". Being that it was like 8% alcohol you are unable to get it in a big liter mug... So i had 4 of the half liters.  It was delicious and boy did i end up feeling it!   My only issue is not being able to give reservations. We had a group of 16, and it would have been great to make them.  That being said, our est wait time of 2 hrs was right on, so no complaint there.   Our service was great! She was very attentive and a fun person! I dont think i could handle that many people at one time! She had no problem splitting up our bill (which was probably a pain) and even reminded us all that gratuity was included for each!  Very considerate!  We ended up having to sit in the dining area and not the bar area so it was much tamer experience that we wanted, but it was still fun!  Good food, good beer equals a great time!",

We were seated at a nice big wooden table on the upstairs patio (which was good, because it looked like a college Oktoberfest party going on in the main restaurant area). We started off with \"the works\" sampler and, despite small portions, everything tasted great (especially the fried pickles, sauerkraut balls, beer cheese. For dinner I had Wurstplatte sampler which was all good. My son had the Bavarian Jagerschnitzel which was very good. My daughter had the Kasespatzel which she said was good. Mom had the cordon blue Schnitzel which she enjoyed. Our dining guest also enjoyed their meals. I also enjoyed a couple half pints of the Hefe Weizen beer. That was good too.

Whenever I've dropped in, strangely enough, it's almost always been midday on a week day ...  Anyway, I am a huge wheat beer lover to I of course go with the Hefeweizen, which is quite tasty (though I still prefer Paulaner's over all others). I like all of the windows that let in an ample amount of sunshine, if the sun happens to not be behind a rain cloud (that happened to me on one visit; it poured. Thank God I was inside chugging beer). It was always empty on my visit except for one when I went later on in the evening. Then it was filled with college students who gave the place a slightly party-ish kind of atmosphere, and I don't mean that in a bad way.  As far as the food, I can't speak to it as absolutely nothing on the menu appeals to me. I've had their pretzels once and those are really good, but I'm not going to drive all of the way to South Side Works for some damn pretzels lol. I haven't heard many good things about their food. From what I gather most people just show up for the beer, especially during Oktoberfest.  I highly suggest visiting when their tapping the kegs for Oktoberfest. THAT was a fun time. ;)",

I love German food so enjoying this food isn't too surprising. I typically get some type of sausage with sauerkraut while my fiance sticks to schnitzel. I know people complain that the food isn't the \"freshest\" but it's still really good and one of the few places that I can get a more traditional style German meal.  The REAL reason we all go is the beer. German beer are some of my favorites and being able to get it in giant glasses just sends me to heaven. It also forces me to sit and enjoy the beer and company a bit more instead of quickly drinking a 12-16 oz pour and moving on to the next place.  The atmosphere is also pretty fun and they work really hard on that so I applaud them. I've actually been to the original Hofbrauhaus  (just walked through, way to busy to sit and eat/drink) and they did a good job recreating everything. I also really like listening to the accordion player. Almost everywhere else that has that type of music would be too much but it works there because it wouldn't feel like the Hofbrauhaus without it.  Some of the cons are that it is a family place and I know that this is not their fault but I'm always a bit annoyed that while I'm trying to enjoy a meal and beer with my friends there's a screaming kid in the background. It also kind of weirds me out seeing babies and toddlers and breweries, no matter the time. I'm also not the biggest fan of the bench like seating. I don't mind bench seating or even getting put at a table with strangers, I just don't like that the benches are really close to one another and it makes it really hard to get in and out of them. I never like asking people to get out of their seats so I can go to the restroom or get some fresh air and unless you have an aisle seat you have to do that.  There's very few Hofbrauauses in the US and if you like German food and drinks I recommend it. Also if you're someone who enjoys Germany or German culture you should check it out.",

So it made up for it.   We started off with the sampler platter and yum! Amazing! I loved the pretzels and the beer cheese was so so good!!!   For my meal, I had the pasta with bacon added to it! Yum! Wasn't sure if it would come out correct because I had added for no diced onion but for the onions to be on top! And they got it right! So very happy about that.",

You can see some of the large brewing equipment on the outside of the building. Step inside though, and you are transported to Bavaria.  Oompah music, long wooden tables, a large, square shaped bar in the middle of the dining room. Waitresses adorned in dirndls, (traditional Oktoberfest attire), and German style beers in 1/2 or full liter pours. If you are looking for a traditional German experience without leaving the country, you found it.  For about $13, you can get a lunch buffet including 3 different sausages, sauerkraut, cabbage, pork cutlet, mashed potatoes, soup, and salad. Its a killer deal for authentic food, especially with the ambiance. Lots of fun.",

    "text": "Haven't been here in ten years. Pleasantly surprised when we returned. Having just been at a hoffbrau in Cleveland, I knew better what to expect. I wasn't into all the traditional German food because to be honest , this place is not my favorite for German food. There are several traditional German places in town we prefer. However , that doesn't mean the food isn't great. My husband got the spaetzle, and I got the salmon with fried cabbage and broccoli with beir cheese. He had the on tap beer which he loved. I'm not a beer drinker so I had red wine.  It was the tapping of the keg celebration and it was packed. It's tremendously loud and crowded. You will most likely sit at a long wooden table with strangers if your party doesn't take up the whole thing. There was plenty of dancing and laughter. This would be a great place for a birthday celebration or anniversary perhaps. Expect super loud singing and table dancing!!. It's not for everyone. We will go back sometime though. Try it out",

We don't live too close, so the trip over is pretty much the whole reason we don't go monthly. For those who aren't local, the 'Burgh isn't easy to travel north-south in...  Anyhoo, I digress. This place is great! We came here with some German friends, and really pressed them about the authenticity of the food and beer. Beers were delicious, as I expected. Good was delicious - Jagerschnitzel, spaetzle, bratwurst, soft pretzels, potato pancakes, sauerkraut poppers, and all the rest we had were awesome! Our German friends loved the place, and vouched for the quality and authenticity of the food and drink, although they did say it wasn't 100% like home, but it was close.  We'll most definitely be back for more. Bring your appetite - this place serves huge portions, and you'll bring boxes home! Uber it for the safest, most enjoyable experience, too. Danke schoen!!!",

    "text": "If I'm not certain that I would like a restaurant, I often purchase Groupon certificates to kind of wade into the pool from the shallow end...  I actually had a lot of not too favorable thoughts before I went to Hofbrauhaus.  (The thought of men with skinny legs in lederhosen singing \"Oompah\" or yodeling kind of scared me...)  However, I was really pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed myself in the beer hall and restaurant.  I also enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Usually when it comes to \"theme\" restaurants, I turn my nose up. (Unfairly, I know, but everyone has their own idiosyncrasies.)  This was a theme restaurant, however, that was really infectious with their enthusiasm and zest towards their theme..  My daughter Muff ordered the Bier Cheese Chicken ($15.99) with grilled chicken breasts topped with Bier cheese, peppers and onions.  She decided on the fries instead of the mashed potatoes.  I ordered the Bavarian Jagerschnitzel which was a pork cutlet topped with a Burgundy Wine mushroom sauce, onions and bacon.  For my sides, I got the potato pancakes and fried cabbage.  We didn't go with any appetizers because we knew the entrees were going to be a little on the heavy side. (Once you add bacon and potatoes to almost anything, the heaviness factor goes up.)  I must say that everything was pretty tasty.  Our server was extremely friendly and very helpful in helping us in selecting our menu items.  Overall, it was very pleasant experience.  My daughter even said that she wanted to come back again with more family members.  It's that kind of place where Nana, Pap-Pap, Uncle Julius and Aunt Pam and all of the rest of your family (Especially little ones) can come and find something to eat and feel satisfied.  Good clean fun with decent food, sing-alongs and a nice atmosphere.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing, according to me!",

It reminded me of a typical cheap light beer, but with a higher price tag. I thought it was interesting that they maintained the quality of their beer by adding flavor when it was poured instead of when making it. They had a good bit of flavors to choose from. I liked the blood orange. We sat inside, because it was storming. It reminded me of a themed restaurant at an amusement park. The outside looked nice for a nicer day.",

I got pierogies as an app, and there was more than enough food for you to make that your main meal if you wanted. I only ate about half as an app and took the rest home.   For our main meal we shared the Schweinshaxen, it was delicious! A little on the expensive side but there was so much food we shared it for dinner and both still had leftovers to take home so it was worth the money. The potato dumpling was my favorite part, it had awesome flavor. I really enjoyed the pork as well. The outside was so crispy, it was similar to a pork rind, and the meat was juicy and flavorful.",

However, I had a college departmental graduation dinner here and was pleasantly surprised by the food as well. As German food isn't know to be the most vegetarian-friendly, I was apprehensive about what my entree options would be. However, there were more vegetarian options than expected, including multiple appetizers, salads, pasta, and garden burger.  For my appetizer, the pretzel and salads complemented each other well. In particular, the pretzel was warm and soft when served and went well with the accompanying mustard. For the main entree, I got the Kaespatzle, which is a pasta with cream sauce, cheese and onions. This dish was slightly heavy and wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting - the first couple bites were good but then the flavors felt a bit monotonous. Dessert included an Apple Strudel and Chocolate Stout cake, both very scrumptious. Overall, its worth a shot to check out the food here, in addition to the beer.",

The others seemed to like their food. I had a Hot Brown, which is turkey, swiss cheese, bacon, and ham on a potato pancake, and it was fine.  The problem was: We had the WORST WAITRESS EVER! She was completely indifferent to her job and taking care of diners wasn't on her radar. She took our orders reasonably soon after we were seated. It took a while for the food to come, but it was a Saturday night and the place was full, so I'm sure the kitchen was busy. However, they had a big army of servers working and they didn't appear to be frazzled or desperately busy. We ordered three appetizers and she brought little plates for seven of us, I guess the other two people were just supposed to eat out of the communal serving dishes.   After bringing the main dishes, she disappeared. Never came back to check on us or see if we had everything. When we finished, she didn't take away the dirty dishes. I saw the Black Forest Cake on the menu online, so I knew I wanted that for dessert. She never brought menus back for dessert. After a long time sitting among a table full of dirty dishes, she came over to bring the check. I told her I wanted the cake and a coffee. She walked away without asking anyone else in our party if they wanted dessert or coffee. My DIL said, \"I guess the rest of us don't get coffee or dessert.\" She brought my coffee and about ten minutes later when the coffee was almost cold, the cake. Still didn't ask anyone else if they wanted anything, nor did she remove the dirty dishes. Two people snagged her and asked for coffee, but she still didn't give anyone a menu for dessert.   Everyone in our family believes in tipping 20%, but we left her $20 for lousy service. I wouldn't go back there.",

I ordered sauerkraut balls with a side of sweet honey mustard, which were piping hot, crunchy and yes, super tangy. The lunch buffet for $11.99 was offered numerous times so I went for it. Schnitzel, soup, salad, brats sauerkraut, mash, and rolls and a few other dishes were the selection. First time I went up, hot and fresh. Second time I went up, food was cold thus the four stars. I got a pecan pie ala mode which was thin, smashed and cold and $6.99! The other reason for four stars. I will be back but will avoid the buffet and overrated and overpriced pie.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, so of course I'd love a stateside version! This is True to the Munich original, if a bit smaller in scale. Same good German beer, same good German food. If that's what you're looking for, you're in luck! If not ... I'd strongly suggest you go elsewhere.  Beer: They have the traditonal lager, a hefeweizen, and a dunkel. Each month they have a special beer of the month, and they also seem to have a 5th brewer's selection at most times. Beers come in 1/2 or full liters. That's it!  Food: My family is German, so I do love a solid German meal. I was in town on business, so I definitely took advantage of the situation to stop in. We don't have too many great German spots in my hometown, so I have to get my fill while in Pennsylvania. I had a pretzel followed by a sandwich, and I subbed in a potato dumpling for a side. Yum yum yum!  Atmosphere: Standard beerhall fare. I was there a bit early (6-730ish), so the main hall was relatively empty. There was a German musician on stage, and overall it made for a pleasant dining atmosphere. Since the crowd was pretty sparse (it was also really cold while I was there), I also had great and attentive service. I'm sure that during College Night or on the weekends, though, the place can get crowded! Perhaps not as much as elsewhere in Pittsburgh as the location seems to be pretty touristy, but I'm sure that's a draw for many.",

    "text": "So we brought about 30 people in after a wedding. No one was being belligerent or overly intoxicated, but a waitress would not serve a table because she felt they were too intoxicated. Obviously this is the establishment's decision, but after talking to the people at that table and observing their mannerisms, they were not overly intoxicated. I could have pointed out over 10 people who were more intoxicated and being louder. This was also right after the table next to them (also our group) had closed out and tipped well. That was very frustrating because we were all together. I understand supporting your employees, but If a waiter or waitress chooses to not serve a customer, they should have a manager approach the group to get their own viewpoint and make a decision on their mannerisms, if that was the case, this probably wouldn't have happened. I have heard a lot of bad things about the service here, but we have had some good experiences before so we gave you a chance, but you fell short. I will not be spending my money here again. This was ridiculous.",

    "text": "I only stopped by briefly for a beer, so I'll keep this review short.  It was my first time going to a Hofbrauhaus restaurant and to a beer garden in general. My first impression was positive. It's a perfectly situated restaurant in Southside Pittsburgh along the Monongahela River. The combination of 1 liter beer mugs, waterfront and waitresses in Dirndls made for a jolly good time.  The environment is very conducive to casual outdoor group drinking. The outdoor area is large with numerous tables. I'm guessing the capacity of the beer garden is close to 150 people. So it's a great place for group parties as well as for taking out of town guests like me who have never been to a beer garden before.    Beer was good I guess, but nothing spectacular. At the time, it was more about quantity over quantity. I didn't get a chance to sample the food, but judging from other tables there are definitely a lot of nice options that go well with beer. Service was pretty average, but waitresses in Dirndls is a plus (maybe?).   As I mentioned before, it's a great place for the occasional group outing. However, as another reviewer mentioned, it definitely carries a huge element of novelty. It's not your neighborhood bar and is not a real cozy place to grab a drink. With that said, I will be back to try the food if I am ever in town again.",

My coworker and I split a giant pretzel which was soft and warm, served with amazing cheese sauce and mustard. I ordered the Jaeger schnitzel and it did not disappoint. It was tender with a crisp, thin crust and the sauce was delicious. It was served with roasted cabbage and German potato salad. While I really enjoyed the cabbage, I wish I would have requested spaetzle instead of the potato salad.  The server was average. She answered our questions and took care of our basic needs, but seemed to be in a bad mood although she never directed it to us.

There's seating both indoors and outdoors-sih (the latter like a patio but not really outside in the cold air), and you can choose to be as close to or as far away from the revelry as you want. Come later at night and people will be drinking and singing, and oftentimes dancing on the benches.   As for the beers and the food, they are quite passable. My personal favorite is the hefeweizen, but they also offer several other standard varieties. There is a lot of German fare food, from wurst to pretzels to salads to various entrees. While I don't personally think they are amazing, they all do go very well with the beer.",

We had a great time! We went on a saturday afternoon and it was a great place to go on a gorgeous day. The beer was delicious and so much fun to drink a whole liter from a humongous glass. We did not do much eating, but am definitely looking forward to coming back here!",

How come the bros get by in just a white and blue button up? Well, at least the dude playing the \"accordion\" (it was a piano) was in legit lederhosen. Work it, German Santa. He played some folk-ish music including Edelweiss. I drank their Doppelbock. It was tasty. It was 8.0% but I could REALLY taste the alcohol more than with other Doppelbocks I've had. I like that they have the ABV on there and also describe the beer. Apparently you can choose your beer sizes. That's fun.  We only got a pretzel with bier cheese, a sweet mustard and obazda for $9.50. Too expensive for a hunk of bread. Should be something like $6.   I could see the appeal of this place for Oktoberfest but I think I'll stay away until then. There's better beer to be had that doesn't subject their female waitstaff to dress like beer wenches.",

This place is huge -- surely it could fit half the population of Pittsburgh.  It's unique, too, I'll give you that.  And the beer prices aren't half bad!  But let's get real.  I thought two things over and over again when I was here: 1.  Did a frat house rent this place out for a party?  I found out, no..... Says the girl next to me, \"It's always like this\". 2.  Is this a Tea Party gathering?  Evidence indicates no, it wasn't, so again \"it's always like this\".",

    "text": "I came here last night for a private party.  Because this wasn't the standard setup, there wasn't table service--rather, food was served in a buffet line and drinks were served at the bar.  Most of the available food was fried (not sure if this is the case for the regular menu).  I tried the pretzels with bier cheese, fried sauerkraut balls, fried pickles, and fried chicken nugget things (they probably have an actual name, but I don't know what it is).  The first thing I noticed was how extremely salty all of the food was.  This was particularly True of the pretzels, and the source was the bier cheese, surprisingly.  Indeed, it became so overwhelmingly salty that by my second pretzel, I started using the Gulden's mustard at the table to cut it, which helped tremendously.  Quite frankly, due to this problem, I was disappointed in the pretzels and cheese, which I'd heard was HBH's signature appetizer.  My favorite of the foods that I tried was the sauerkraut balls, which were still salty, but at least had some tanginess due to the vinegar.  The chicken and pickles were pretty nondescript.  There was also apple strudel for dessert, which was okay, but not great.  Not surprisingly, I was thirsty after eating all of the extremely salty food, so I ordered a cherry cosmopolitan to wash it down.  I did really enjoy this drink, which was quite delicious and refreshing after all the salt I'd just ingested.  While I'm aware that most people come to HBH for the beer, I'm not a beer drinker, so I was a bit concerned that only beer would be available for drinks.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth of the drink menu, which included several cocktails, shots, and wines in addition to the beer.  As others have commented, aside from the beer, the ambiance is what really defines HBH.  There was live music playing most of the time I was there, which consisted of a (strange) mix of traditional German songs and covers of '80's music.  Many of the attendees got into singing the covers and did the whole standing on the bench thing, which was fun.  Because of this, it was quite loud in the beer hall most of the time, but I was able to escape this when I tired of it by going out to the balcony, which has a nice view of the river.  Like Mad Mex, HBH is a theme restaurant that people come to to have a rowdy good time with the help of some liquid libation.  However, also like Mad Mex, the quality of the food leaves something to be desired, so don't go there expecting a great meal.  I'm glad I experienced it once, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return unless a group of my friends wanted to come.",

They do not take reservations and even though my husband called and talked to a manager who said they'd do their best to accommodate us, no one passed the word onto the evening manager, so our group of 21 sat waiting for 2 tables.  Once that was done, we all had a great time.  The waitress was sympathetic to our older folks sitting right in front of the 'band' and didn't mind repeating things two and three times to our group.  We got our beers / drinks quickly and really enjoyed the loud, chaotic atmosphere.  There were mostly families and large groups when we were there, I assume the crowd changes drastically after 9pm.  The food was good - no problem substituting spaetzle for potato salad (I find their kartoffel salat a bit too sweet).  I had the Jagerschnitzel which I thought was pretty good.  The potato pancakes were a little over-fried (according to some of our guests at the table).  I've had the wurst platters and they are pretty good.  All in all, if you're up for a loud, adventurous night and meeting total strangers, you'll enjoy the Hofbrauhaus.  We did a lot of singing, shot-skis and just had an all around fun time.",

It was like nothing I'd had before so was unique in that way. Just not sure if I like German food or not. I think I liked it. My fiancee and her father had some other dishes which they were quite pleased with, but the joy was the music. We were there on a Saturday night and there was an accordion band in the front singing their hearts out. They even sang Sweet Caroline, which being a Boston native I had to sing along with. and yet, there was a room full of Pittsburghers singing along! It was a blast.  They also had a special where if you ordered a liter of beer, you got to keep the mug, so I'll always have a memento of Hofbrauhaus in the form of an enormous mug.",

    "text": "So my review of the food may or may not really be accurate, considering that I'm a huge lightweight when it comes to beer. I had one stein's worth and... at that point everything tastes delicious to me.  I was visiting a friend who goes to school in Grove City and she said that the Hofbrauhaus was a must-visit place in Pittsburgh. My other friend and I got off the airplane from NYC at 9PM and the three of us headed straight for this place for some dinner and beer.  We went just when Storm Khan was rushing through, though I guess Pittsburgh was relatively safe. The parking was pretty far and the walk kind of sucked. What sucked more was by the time we got there and were pulling out our IDs, my friend from NY realized she didn't have her ID on her, so we had to walk back to the car. The bouncer laughed at us and led us in.  Oh jeez, I have never been to a crazier beer garden. People were screaming along to songs on the top of their lungs, dancing on benches and swinging their steins. We were really hungry, so we opted to sit in a booth so that we could also talk. Basically, whenever the band paused, we would squeeze as much conversation as we could before being overwhelmed by sound again. It seemed like everyone was having a great time. The general ambiance was really impressive!  The food and beers were great! We ordered the Hofbrauhaus Pretzels for our appetizers, and the three of us got the Jaegerschnitzel (me), the pork loin special, and Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte. The Jaegershnitzel was DELICIOUS. Omg, it was like honestly the best breaded pork cutlet I have eaten in my life. It was very soft on the inside, yet the skin was crunchy and flavorful. The portions were pretty big too. The German potato salad was interesting (more like scalloped potatoes) and the pickled cabbage was delectable, even though I am not a fan of anything pickled. My friend's pork loin was tender and juicy. I'm always scared of pork loins because usually they get too dried out, but this one was good, along with the mashed potatoes! The Wurstplatte was interesting. There were three different types of sausages, which I do not remember what they are called. I like the white one the best because it was so soft, almost like a fish sausage. It wasn't sharp and salty like normal sausages.  The pretzels were very salty (waaaay too much rock pieces on them) and the cheese was salty as well, but I don't like pretzels in general so I didn't dock any points off since I have a bias against them anyway. I ordered a stein of the Hofbrau Premium Lager, which was light and delicious. I think I got tipsy so quickly because I hadn't eaten anything else that whole day to prepare myself for this place. My Pitt friend ordered the Hofbrau Weizen, which was a bit too banana-y for my tastes, though the other two insisted that it was the best beer they had ever had. It was good, but not my favorite.  In general this place is a great experience. If you like rowdy crowds, friendly waiters, and great German food, this place is for you!",

Each time I come to Hofbrauhaus, I make sure to try one of their seasonal beers. So far, I have tried the Weizenbock, Bavarian Wheat and the Marzen. Outside of this, I have tried most of their other beers with the Weizen being my favorite. The great thing about the Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh is the fact that they brew their beers there! This means you will always get a fresh beer!  As for the food; the food is always great! It's a little expensive; however, the portions are huge! When I go, I always split the Schmankerlplatte with someone. This plate consists of Schweinsbraten, Smoked Pork Chops, three kinds of Wursts, Sauerkraut, Fried Cabbage, and Mashed Potatoes. It's huge! Everything on it is great!  My only complaint with this place is the lack of parking; however, this is an issue pretty much anywhere you go in Pittsburgh.",

I was on limited time with my friend from Boston.  We went there for some bar appetizers and a couple beers.  Our food only cost $13.  Beers another $13.  The waiter redeemed my Groupon without advising me or asking me if I really wanted to do that since it was not benefitting me with the additional $12 value intended.  I talked to his manager.  She said the same thing.  CAVEAT EMPTOR.  Aka, Buyer Beware!  She told me once Groupon is redeemed, it can not be altered.  I recommended that she have a team meeting with her staff to train them better for the next patron.  Once again, she had the audacity to tell me, YOU didn't read the fine print.  I got her message loud and clear.  I told her, I understand clearly her position and that it must have been 100% my fault.  Bon Appetit.  I won't be spending any more of my money at this joint.

We went there on a Saturday night on a recent trip to Pittsburgh and the place was jam-packed and everyone was having fun.

Beer is brewed there, and is good and cheap -- the  liters were about $8. The wheat beer was nice, so was the lager.  We didn't have the food, so I can't comment on that.  Go with a group of friends.

Hostess looks at me as if I am off my rocker for thinking that we could get seated for dinner (at 9 pm!) and says, \"We aren't taking names any more tonight, but if you want to wait about an hour, we switch to open seating.\"  Open seating, as she further explains, means that at that point, we will have to wander the restaurant looking for an empty table, fight our way to it, hope no one else grabs it before we can get there, and then wait to have a server notice us.   We took one glance at the frat-boys and already-drunk cougars and decided to try one of the other places near by.   I don't care if they have the best German food on Earth (and looking at the priorities of the clientele, I'm guessing they don't) such lousy service is not going to win my business when there are so many other options in this town.",

    "text": "I admit that I've been putting off a trip to Hofbrauhaus for a long time. It wasn't that I was against going there, per say, but my absolute hatred of the South Side Works and what is offered there--both establishments and personalities--made me think I would loath it just because of its location. But my affinity for beer, especially beer in giant glass mugs, and the fact that it was the location of one of my good friends 25th birthday party celebration finally brought me in.  I arrived sometime around 11 on a Friday night to a line circling around the side of the building. At once I thought my fears were confirmed, a long line of what I perceived to be South Side douche bags. But as I got closer I realized that it wasn't just a bunch of frat boys in line, but there were people of all ages and all walks of life waiting to get in. On top of that the line moved very quickly and all in all only spent about five minutes waiting to get inside.  Once inside I made my way to the bar area, which was much more spacious than I thought it would be. That being said, Hofbrauhaus was still extremely crowded leaving little room to stand without bumping in to someone or having someone bump in to you. The dense crowd also left long waits for beer. The bartending staff tried their best to keep up, but there is only so much they can do when you have hundreds of people making human sardines around the bar all trying to order a beer at the same time.  I ordered a liter of Dunkel, and when it was finally served to me, tasted pretty good. I'm not all that familiar with German style beers so I'm in no position to comment on its quality, but from an amateur perspective I thought it possessed a strong and unique flavor. The price for a liter wasn't bad, especially considering the location of Hofbrauhaus. I believe the \"big mug\" ran somewhere between $7 and $8. I wish I would have had more time to try a few of the other brews but I didn't get the chance.  The atmosphere of Hofbrauhaus is a bit more rowdy than I expected. Long rows of thick wooden tables and benches line the open space between the bar and the stage which aren't used for sitting but instead standing upon. From this perch one feels like he or she is the life of the party singing songs and swinging mugs about, beer sloshing out like a geyser.  The band was lively, fun, dressed in authentic Bavarian dress, and I could tell they really did have a passion for the music they were playing, but I was really hoping for something a big more authentic. Most of the songs they played were American covers, nothing but a few songs were German.  My experience at Hofbrauhaus was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. It wasn't as much of a corporate juggernaut bar like many of the other bars in the South Side Works area, even though the amount of people they allow to be packed in at once makes you wonder if they care more about their profits or the experiences of their patrons. Will I come back? Probably yes, but only from time to time. I much prefer smaller less crowded and noisy bars, but if I have to pick a larger venue bar Hofbrauhaus would be the place.",

For my entree I order the wiener schnitzel with steamed vegetables and German potato salad. The pork was fried perfectly and was both juicy and crispy and could easily last 2 meals. The potato salad had a nice balance of spice and was light on the mustard and mayo relative to picnic potato salads. It was a struggle to finish both my meal and my beer, but hey, I'm on vacation.

The food from what I've tasted is good and the beer is delicious - I prefer Hefeweizen's so I can't comment on the other type of beers.     Seeing that this is one of three Hofbrauhaus' in the U.S. (Cincinnatti, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh), Pittsburghers should feel proud to have the opportunity to experience this wonderful place.

    "text": "This was actually our first stop in Pittsburgh, so I guess I should have reviewed this first! Oops!   My friend tells me that Hofbrauhaus is ALWAYS a staple for him to take his out-of-town visitors. The first things that you'll notice even before you enter the building are the beer silos. Yup, they brew their own beers, which makes it cheap for you and me! The next thing you'll notice are.. the bewbs. The ladies who work here don't wear a complete skimpy outfit like they do at Hooters or Tilted Kilt, etc. but they do show off their top heavy bosoms. Very nice. ;)  We came around 8 and my friend immediately requested that we sat inside when we were asked. Why? Wait till around 9PM and you'll see. Okay, impatient? I'll tell yinz (yes, I did pick up on some of their slang)! Around 9 or maybe 9:30, the Haus Band comes on and plays every type of song under the sun, ranging from The Lion sleeps Tonight to Call Me Maybe. Surprisingly, there was a good bit of country music thrown in the mix. Everything was well received by the audience, who seemed to know every word of every song they played. When you throw together people who know how to have a good time, plus a flow of cheap beer, plus a very good band who knows how to play just about every song you can think of and seems to get better the more they drink, what do you get? Everyone dancing their butts off on top of their benches. It is quite a site to see and an experience you must have in life. My friend did give us a disclaimer that if we wanted to talk about anything that evening, to get it out right away because we won't get an opportunity to later. He was right! Lol.  As if all of that wasn't entertaining enough, there's this REALLY old guy who makes an appearance almost every night. He comes out a little bit after the band does and dances with every pretty lady in the building. Some of his risque moves though.. yeah, he gets away with it because he's an old guy haha. Let me tell ya, he's a hoot and a half! I've got some interesting photos and videos to prove it.  So, aside from the bustling festivities, I thought the food was just okay but the beau and friends all loved what they got. Definitely opt for their in-house brewed beers and pay a little extra to keep a [brand new, never used] souvenir pint glass to take home.  We were stuffed and tired from all the singing and dancing, but my friend took us outside behind the pub and showed us the beer garden, which was very peaceful and romantic (surprisingly). It has a fantastic view of the river and looks even more amazing with the reflection of the city lights bouncing off from it. If you're wanting to grab some authentic German grub, but are not in the mood to burn off all those calories just yet, opt to sit outside.",

It didn't take long for the tides to turn on the 'seat yourself,' 'cafeteria style' seating as a server never seemed to appear to take an order. We may have been less apt to judge had a server granted even a simple drink order. But we sat to wait for at least twenty minutes. On the brink of trying the Irish place across the street, we were finally greeted by an apologetic hostess.     When the food and beer finally arrived (wursts on a bun and a liter, for me) we thoroughly enjoyed the cuisine. After the orders were taken there was hardly a wait for the food to arrive. The bill followed suit. The food was wonderful for the portions and quality.  I would probably try this place again on a week night, as we ate in on a Saturday.  It might be less crowded and more enjoyable.",

There were even some things on the menu I've never had before that were fun to try like sauerkraut balls and fried pickles.   I enjoyed their beer as well.  They have a different seasonal brew every month as well as their regulars.  All were good and stick to the German brewing rules.  For comparison though, I liked what I had here better than the similar beers one would find at Gordon Biersch.  Oh yeah, having four people do a shot off a ski in front of the whole place is a good time.  We actually had our kids along and they did great.  Plus the place is so damn loud they can make all the noise they want.  The live music was also a neat experience.  Long story short, I'd like to come back without any kids and get hammered with the crowd there that I can guess gets rowdy as the night goes on.",

We got beer explanations and recoommendations and enjoyed the very short wait for the food.   I am a breaded pork cutlet  fan so i ardered the weinerschnitzel.   Wow....I was huge, hot, and delicious with not a drop of grease!  The sauce went well with the meat too!   I could have this dish over and over again!

Are there many other places out there where you can drink and hear live polka music?  Very few!  Enjoy the atmosphere, have a sausage, and drink a beer.  You'll feel better after you do.",

Their seasonal beers are terrific, and of course the Hefeweisen is a solid standby.  The pretzels will blow your mind, and the sauerbraten, spaetzle, and wursts are all pitch-perfect.  I give it four stars because the size, crowds, and noise can get kind of overwhelming to me - a personal preference, I admit!  I give them lots of credit for stepping outside the wurst-and-kraut standards to provide the schnitzel cordon bleu (which, beware: it's way cheesier than you expect!) and the Heidelberger Rahm Spaetzle, a kind of creamy chicken-and-spaetzle marsala that I order when I don't feel like moving for the next few hours.  I'd say Hofbrauhaus is a must-visit!",

An hour and 15 minutes later, we were still waiting.  I went in and asked again how long it would be, and a second hostess said that the kitchen backed up, and that they just started seating again, and it would be another 20 minutes.   I wish someone had told us from the outset that they weren't seating, and that the estimated wait was over 90 minutes. We would have went elsewhere instead of waiting around.  Or, since they did have our cell number, someone could have sent a text explaining the situation.   Needless to say, we never did try the food because we didn't want to wait any longer just to be seated....from the complaints of others that we could over hear, food was taking a long time as well.  If the kitchen can't handle the volume of orders coming back, perhaps they shouldn't seat so many at one time.  I understand that things happen, but you have to be up front with customers, and not let people wait way longer than they are expecting to with no explanation.  Seems like it would be a good place, but this situation left a sour taste in my mouth, and I doubt we will return.",

The foodie side of me says this place compares to a TGIFridays, but with German food.   The first time I came here was right after they opened....so I wanted to come for the food and drink.  It was the dead of winter so the outdoor area wasn't open yet and we were shoved in the corner of the large dining room.  I couldn't decide what to order because I love sauerkraut, I love cabbage and I love German Potato Salad!  It's sad I didn't even want any of the meats, all sides!  So I just stuck to those and apps.  I mean who can go wrong with those choices??   So the fried pickles were good and....fried.  Check.  The sauerkraut was like mush.  Ew.  I expect good sauerkraut from a German place!  I want it crisp and tart.  Just plain mush.  The German Potato salad, mushy as well.  Potato's, mushy....no flavor.  Yuck.  Fried Cabbage...you hear me....FRIED....was mush!  Seriously, horrible!  I would never come here to eat again.    On the other side....   Atmosphere is fantastic! The dining room is really rambunctious! They have people standing on tables and singing.  they have a HUGE shot luge where a bunch of people have to take shots at once.  And the outside...FANTASTIC!  It's this huge open area with picnic tables and a large bar.  Plus you're right smack against the river so it's really pretty out to.  Pretty for a beer garden I suppose!  The beer comes in these huge liters, which is great in theory, but if you're not slamming them back it gets warm and nasty.  I'm always a lager fan, so I had the Hofbrau Premium Lager.  It was pretty much lager like.  Nothing to write home to Germany about.   So remember, food gross but drinking atmosphere GREAT!",

    "text": "The experience of walking into this river-front homage to a traditional German bier hall feels less like my idea of Oktoberfest in Munich and more like Bill Murray's life a la Groundhog Day.  I can say this because I've been there 3-4 times and the story always plays out the same way...it's up to you to somehow drive the plot in a different direction.  Perhaps I'm missing the point...after all we return to most establishments seeking a consistent and memorable investment of our time and money...but I like to think we as Pittsburghers take more pride in our small locally owned watering holes than the same hoopla you'd find at Busch Gardens.    There is no formal parking lot at the Hofbrauhaus, just several nearby multi-level parking garages and a handful of metered spots in and around the Southside Works complex.  Chances are you'll pay something to park within walking distance.    Once inside everything seems larger than life...the tall ceilings, medieval sized tables that seat dozens, the shameless display of cleavage, and most of all...my disdain for boring and flavorless lagers.  I'll admit...I am a total beer snob...always hunting down the hoppiest of imperial IPA, but I will gladly find comfort in a nice malty dopplebock if it's available.  Alas, i've learned from the Seasonal release schedule that February is the only time of year when the style is on tap.   The food is exactly what you'd hope for; variations of wursts, schnitzels, potato pancakes and pretzels as well as some \"American\" choices - Burgers, Salads, etc.  It's the cavalade of starch and sausage that you'd want while eating cafeteria style to the tune of Journey's \"Don't stop believing\" honked out on accordion.    Who doesn't like to have their meal-time conversation interrupted by yinzers of all ages shouting a mispronounced \"ZICKE ZACKE\"  atop the same wooden benches that make it near impossible to \"shimmy\" yourself out to use the restroom.    Though I've never taken part in a shot-ski...I get the appeal.  The overall sense of merriment at the Hofbrau is perfect for getting large groups together as an impersonal celebration of special events, birthdays and a place to party with absolute strangers on any given weeknight.  For my money, I'll stick to Penn Brewery to get my fix of German fare with house-made brews...but thats just me; The hop-head whose personal nightmare is accepting being just a predictable part of the crowd.",

For my entree I had the Wurstplatte, which is a sampler of the bierwurst, bratwurst, and frankfurter. The food in general is pretty heavy, but I still managed to clean my plate. The wursts were very good, and the sides of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut were delicious.  This is not the kind of place I could be a regular at, but it is definitely a great spot to enjoy every so often, and it is great for groups.

    "text": "Some may claim heresy, but I for one am a huge fan of the new Hofbrahaus.  As much as I liked to go and have as many liters of beer and shotski's as my body pleased back in the day, Hofbra became such a party destination recently that the mood had transitioned from a community feeling of fun to a drunk titanic weighting down the South Side.  With the new ID requirements, drink limits, and elimination of a few of the drinking rituals of past, you can actually go to Hofbra on a Friday or Saturday night to relax and have a genuinely good time.  The beer is, as always, historic to the traditional ways of German brewing.  No crazy variations or additions here...  Water, Malt, Hops, and Yeast.  Done.  For those looking for more adventurous craft offerings, you'll likely disappointed.  However, if you have a True appreciation for German offerings, Hofbra is a great asset to the city in that regard.  The food overall is decent.  Nothing to write home about, but the pretzels and beer cheese make a fantastic drinking companion.  Overall, Hofbra continues to be a great destination for locals and out of towners alike (still one of only three or four in the country I believe!).",

You must have an appetizer when you go...try the pretzel, it comes with several awesome sauces for dipping, or the nachos or anyting there.  Their steaks are fantastic, sandwiches, dinners are to die for.  The beer that they serve is fantastic as well...even if you don't drink, you should start if you go there!  LOL  Definitely one of my favorites....",

But, what I really like about going there is the atmosphere of gemutlichkeit (geniality, friendliness) that I have experienced myself in Germany.  It's fun sitting at bench seats with a dozen of your friends, drinking from glass steins the size of your forearm, singing \"Sweet Caroline\" for the seventh time, and I've never had a meal that I didn't like.  Hard to miss on good old fashioned meat and potatoes cooking, although it would be nice to see German style salads, which are completely underrated and amazing.  But, overall, it's a fun place whether you're indoors with the din of commotion or out on the more subdued patio, or the outdoor biergarten next to the river.",

The service here was top notch.  We were a party of four and Chris was very attentive and knowledgable about the beer.  I got the sampler, which ran under $8 for 5 beers. What a deal!  They were all good.   The food was nothing special. The pretzel appetizer was too salty.  My pierogies tasted like Mrs. T's.  They were supposed to have bacon and chives, but all I got were pierogies with sour cream and onion straws.  We were there for the trivia night, which was enjoyable. During that, I got the nacho appetizer.  Again, nothing special.  The food is extremely overpriced for the quality.  You can phone in the German music and mead hall atmosphere, but it doesn't fix the food.  Go for the beer...after going to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory across the street.",

In terms of the environment,  the waitresses are dressed in German uniforms and they have a live band playing.

The ambience is cute, with the waiters in Lederhosen and the waitresses in drindles, and a seemingly-authentic menu.  The beer is above average, but barely.   Now to the food.  Without the beer, I would give zero stars.  Absolutely horrendous.  The few standouts were the fried cabbage and weisswurst.   The weiner schnitzel was well below average.  The kraut was cold and bland.  \"imported\" or not.  The pork cutlets were so incredibly dry that even gravy couldn't save them.  Cute try at a German bierhall, but the food is awful.  If you are looking for authentic German fare without the Lederhosen and tacky decorations, go to Max's Allegheny Tavern on the North Side.  They have been doing it well since 1903, when the area was called \"Deutschtown\" because of the large number of German immigrants.",

    "text": "In all honesty, this place almost got a bad review if the food wasn't so damn good. My cousin took us here. Three of us are over 21 and the fourth is 19. It is a restaurant that serves a lot of really good beer and amazing German food.   Oddly enough and it makes no sense to me, after 9pm they won't let anyone under 21 inside so there was a moment when things felt really stressful. We then learned we could eat in the restaurant on one side we just couldn't eat on the side with the live music and where the bar was.   When we got our table the hostess was incredibly rude. There was a table with three women on one end and 5 empty chairs on the other end of the same table. The dining room we were in was practically empty so I still don't understand why the hostess tried to sit us at the same table with three total strangers? The women at the table gave her the funniest side eyed look I have seen. Then she puts us at the empty table just one row over but it was missing a chair. Instead of taking the chair from the adjacent table, she marched over to the table where the three women were and yanked one of the chairs from the table making a commotion with this awful pissed off look on her face. Slammed it under our table and walked off. We joked with each other that we should have offered to get the chair for her, maybe it wasn't in her job description or maybe she knew and didn't like the three women at the table.   Then comes in cute little blond girl with glasses and a smile from ear to ear. She is our waitress. Super friendly, offered advice when we asked about menu items and overall had a great personality.  OMG! When the food came I was in HEAVEN! The BEST Perogies I have ever had, I do not like cabbage but I LOVED the cabbage here. It was cooked and seasoned so well I could have eaten it all night.   We walked across to the other side after dinner, took a few facebook live videos of the band and everyone standing and dancing on their tables. It was a great experience. Then we went back to the restaurant side to pick up our 19 year old friend. LOL  I recommend going here for sure, if you have minors with you under 21 try and go before 9pm. The strange thing is when I walked across into that area, there were families with children in there but our 19 year old friend wasn't allowed after 9? So if we would have gotten there at 8:30 and stayed until 11:00 he could have gone on that side so it does seem a little strange, but those are the rules.",

I immediately recalled the inedible meal that I had been served at Munich's Hofbrauhaus. Boy am I glad I kept an open mind, because I had a delightful time at this place!  First, our server, Karen, was the bee's knees! She was pleasant, attentive, and friendly. The food didn't hurt my feelings either. My boyfriend ordered the massive pretzel appetizer and he loved it. He's about the proudest Bavarian from backwoods Bavaria you ever did meet, so he knows him some pretzels if'n ya know what I mean! I ordered the cheese fries. I'm not a big fan of cheese sauce on my fries; I prefer the real deal! But these things were A-mazing. I could eat that cheese sauce by the spoonful. Also, when I asked for my Southern tzatziki aka ranch dressing, Karen didn't culture shame me. So gracious!! And speaking of the ranch, unexpectedly good -- at a Bavarian restaurant, no less!! Maybe even house made?  Now let's talk about that schnitzel. I had the Jagerschnitzel and it was awesome. It tasted pretty authentic, but what does authentic mean? I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I never had crappy schnitzel the whole time I lived in Germany, and I'm pretty sure all of those schnitzels -- even the less tasty ones -- were made by Germans. The schnitzel was not heavily breaded, which I prefer. The hungry Bavarian sitting to my left said that, although his schnitzel didn't taste authentic to him, he didn't care because it tasted so good.  It's a regional thing; an Oma in one town probably has a completely different prep style than an Oma in a town a couple clicks away.  To all ye hipsters, stop beating ye auld drumme of authenticity!  Since we're on the subject of hipsters, there was a noticeable lack of hipsters and young intelligentsia cluttering up the booths. Can I get an amen, praise Jesus, and a hallelujah all at once?!? It could be because Hofbrauhaus is a -- gasp! chain restaurant! Fine by me. The pleasure of a dining experience is inversely related to hipsters. Score!  Another score? The serving sizes should come with a warning. A skull and crossbones would be too severe, but perhaps a \"consult a physician before...\" could be helpful. Seriously, though, anything that saves this girl money and doesn't skimp on quality? Win-win in my book!  Would I go back?? No need to threaten me with a good time!",

Everyone enjoyed their drinks, and the food was great. I had some kind of schnitzel and loved it. Also, we ordered many appetizers: the pierogis, spinach artichoke dip, and the pretzel. All delicious!   The service was great, our waitress was tentative and made sure everything was in place. Then when it got busier more staff came out to help. The whole time there was live music playing from an accordion! This guy sung in German and enhanced the atmosphere. The only thing I would change about this place is the lack of parking. There was no parking for at least a block around the restaurant. Otherwise, we had a great time and I'd highly recommend it!",

It's nice you can seat yourself but arrive earlier because it gets packed. We were sitting a while before a server came over. She was super friendly and nice the whole evening but we didn't receive our meal until about an hour later since she had so many tables to herself. It was clear they were super understaffed. Food was average but nothing super impressive. We would pass on the food next time and just stick to drinks. I did however love the sauerkraut and I don't even enjoy sauerkraut! haha delish.",

    "text": "This place is AWESOME!  Giant beers and large portioned entrees are the name of the game.  I had a Bavarian Jagerschnitzel which was absolutely outstanding.  It was a great entree to get here because it would take forever to make something similar at home, if I even could.  Plenty of flavor everywhere.  My son had a Wurst on a Bun which was just kind of so-so.  The Bratwurst was good, but it was just a pretty plain meal for a place that offers so much more.  Fries, roll, brat, sauerkraut on the side...thats it.  Check the picture out if you want to see what I mean.  My wife had a Dunkel Bourbon Chicken Sandwich and it was pretty awesome too; she was very happy with it.  This was upon recommendation of our server who was very good.  My youngest had something off the kid menu for $5.99; he didn't ruin my lunch with a temper tantrum, so I give his meal an A+ even though I don't even remember it.  The only knock on them, which is completely avoidable, is their flavored beer.  They just pump some fake flavoring into their regular beer which results in a degradation of a perfectly decent brew.  They offer 3 free samples per person, so if you are thinking you are going to go that route, sample that bad boy first, you might be pretty happy you did before you have a liter of it in front of you.   Ultimately, great restaurant, really great actually.  I can't wait to come back here again, I want to try something different but its going to be awful hard to pull the trigger on something other than their schnitzel.",

I just went on a Friday night for some post dinner beers, dessert and entertainment and it was perfect for that. Yes, this is also a great place to celebrate a birthday, or take a big group but it's also great if you want to just listen to the music, have some beers and people watch.   You can not go wrong with any of their beers and their apple strudel was very good. Make sure to check out their seasonal beer when you are there. I highly recommend it.   TIP: You can put your name on the waitlist through yelp and see your place in line. We had 12 tables ahead of us and it was not much more than a 20 min wait.",

Definitely the best in the states.  My wife and I got there around 8pm on a Saturday and there was a 2.5 hour wait!  We were able to get seats at the bar which worked fine.  It's great they brew their own beer.  The lager was on par with Germany.  I found the funnel a little maltier.  For dinner I ordered the Muncher Weisswurste.  This is a traditional Bavarian lunch which has two sausages served poached that you peel the skin off with a soft pretzel.  The skin peeled off easily which normally doesn't happen stateside.  They did a great job.  Nearly the whole crowd in the beer hall was getting into the music and dancing on their chairs having a great time.",

To me, she is the gold standard that all other waiters & waitresses will be measured against from here on out lol.   The beers were great and we had a fantastic time but I have to comment on the wurst meals we got. Generally they should come with some type of hard crusted roll and German mustard. These came with hotdog buns, and not just any hotdog bun but the cheapest white bread bun kind available. And the mustard available at the table is picnic grade Heinz yellow mustard. Great for grilled burgers and hotdogs but not for bierwurst or bratwurst at a German restaurant.  We had a bit of a chuckle about it, beer probably helped with that, but next time I am going to ask for ways to customize that order.",

My mother enjoyed her German potato salad and sauerkraut balls. My wife always loves the fish sandwich and it seems to have grown in size. My son enjoyed his burger.

    "text": "OK. So I'm half German and never ate at a German restaurant before so I thought it might be cool that the family wanted to go. So I looked on their website and was iffy The rows of tables as if you were in a high school cafeteria didn't excite me. The menu had LOTS of pork items on it. I'm OK with that but it didn't seem as if they really had enough of other things on it.  We arrive and as we walk past the reception area I could not believe at how LOUD it was in there. I even said, \"It is FAR too noisy in here.\" and I could barely even hear myself say it.  While the girls working there wore cute little German style dresses I noticed the guys just wore shirts and slacks. That's no fun at all. The only guys I saw in German style clothes was members of the band who only set up and tested some stuff before we left. But with as LOUD as the place is I'd think having live music would be utterly worthless.  There was SOOO much noise from EVERYBODY else talking that I couldn't hear anybody at my table. A cousin's kid was across the table and 2 away from me and I could hear him talking but not anything he was actually saying. My cousin at the  other end of the table cold not be heard at all. If I didn't see her mouth moving I would not have believed she was talking at all.  The bathrooms are completely wrong. No paper towels, just air blowers. Yes, that right, I might as well just have had all of the other customers fart on my hands until they were dry. I HATE THAT! Then to make it worse, you have to PULL the doors to leave. So now if other customers didn't wash their hands then it makes it completely worthless if you did. Apparently customer hygiene isn't a concern of theirs.   It is absolutely ridiculous at how much you can hear EVERYBODY ELSE in the place EXCEPT the people you are with . Since I couldn't hear anybody I just spent most of my time just watching one of the TVs. What a complete waste of spending time with family from out of town.   I got the white sausage, veal and pork. It was good but found it silly that it's side was a pretzel. Especially since they are appetizers and desert too. I also got a potato dumpling which I liked. I'm glad I did cause the 2 sausages and pretzel would not have been enough. But overall it was OK. I mean how can you screw up pretzels. A cousin go pierogies which were fried which I don't prefer to be done that way. Both of my sisters and my mom got the french dip. They liked them, especially the pretzel roll but felt the meat was a bit dry. I was thinking about that at first but was disappointed that it only came with fries which could be swapped out for soup or salad but not any other side.  It finally started to be a LITTLE less noisy as some people left but then they turned on music which made up for the loss of people. So STILL you can't hear a single person you are with. So completely stupid.  Let's not forget that this is South Side too where parking already sucks big time. But they are the very back and are not too close to any parking so you are pretty much forced to use their valet parking.  Since the sound of EVERYBODY else being so stinking loud it forces everybody else to talk louder just so they can hear each other. This just compounds the problem. The noise level is so utterly over the top, ridiculously absurd that I just cannot state it enough.  If they could fix the noise problem somehow it would raise it another star. Fix the bathroom issue AND make EVERYBODY were German style clothes would raise it another star. But this would never be a 5 star place. Just FAR TOO MUCH LOUD NOISE for that to ever be possible. I will NEVER go back here, unless I am completely deaf.",

    "text": "This was my first opportunity to try Hofbrauhaus and believe me it did not disappoint! When I arrived for lunch the place was fairly empty and I could sit anywhere I wanted. The restaurant resembles a big German beer garden with waiters and waitresses dressed in authentic attire. There is a large bar for German beers and you really feel like you are in Germany here.  I had a very friendly and helpful waiter who told me that at lunch they have a smorgasbord style meal for $11.99 where you can eat at their salad bar and then have as much as you want of authentic German food. Pretty good deal but I felt that would be a little too much for me. I inquired about gluten free, vegetarian, and children's items. My waiter gave me a separate menu for each of them. Sorry, there are no vegan options here.  Normally their sandwiches come with fries but you can \"swap\" them out for free as long as they are listed on the regular sides menu. Certain ones carry a small up charge. I want to try their schnitzel sandwich and asked if I could have it on a pretzel roll. He told me I could for $.99 more. No problem here. I swapped out the fries for a broccoli and bier cheese combo.  I had my food in no time and believe me the size on that schnitzel was almost like the size of a large fried fish you would find in other restaurants. Needless to say it was very good and quite filling! The broccoli and cheese were cooked to perfection! One of the hostesses came to me and chatted with me about my food and explained the restaurant concept. I really felt welcomed here. I was offered dessert but that sandwich was all I could handle. Maybe next time.  Hofbrauhaus is located on Water St next to a hotel on the back side of Southside works. Metered street parking is available on some of the side streets. It sits near the Hot Metal bridge where there is a parking garage if you find you are having trouble parking.   Please note Hofbrauhaus is a chain restaurant and you will find it in other cities. This place is very popular and does get crowded at night. Definitely worth a visit!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for dinner on a Friday night.  Ordered their Works sampler appetizer, the Bavarian sampler plate as an entree.  We also ordered a half size beer and a full size beer.  What's Hot  - Cost.  We came here because of a Groupon.  The groupon is $13 for at least $25 worth of food, which is a pretty decent deal.  With the groupon, however, our total was around $50.  Still paid a lot for the evening, but that they have savings is helpful. - Menu variety.  There are appetizers, sausages, roasted pork, sandwiches, desserts, plenty of drinks, etc...  If you're not into beer, there are mixed drinks, cocktails, shots, etc...  They have monthly food specials.  The variety is helpful. - Portions.  You definitely get what you pay for.  Our appetizer had everything and it was a lot of food.  Our sampler plate main entree was definitely a mountain of food.  I recommend sharing food, which may help cut down on cost, as well. - Quality.  The food was pretty good, but not knock your socks off.  The fried sauerkraut, in the sampler appetizer platter is pretty good.  Hubby is not a fan of sauerkraut and he really enjoyed the fried sauerkraut.  It doesn't have the usual tang and had an added type of potato flavor.  Really good fried pickles too- not too sour and not overly battered.  The pretzels were warm and soft.  The potato pancakes were just fried or heated.  Highly recommend their bier cheese dip. - Service.  Pretty good and definitely not rushed, which is nice because this is a place where you will be taking your time.  It wasn't completely full when we came, so I'm not certain what their service is like when they're packed and busy.     - Location.  It's right on the river, so the view is great no matter when you go.  There's also a lot of other places around the restaurant- other shops, restaurants, grocery stores, etc...    What's Not - Cost.  The food is pretty pricey.  The sampler appetizer is $14 and the Bavarian sampler entree is $34.  There are less expensive items on the menu.  However, this is a beer house.  Even with the groupon, our total was around $50.  With drinks and food, It's easy for your tab to add up, so be aware.   - Parking.  There's no free parking in the area.  You can either go valet or pay for parking on the street.  Be prepared, especially depending on which day and time of day you go.   - Service.  The main thing we didn't like about their service is that you can only get help from your assigned waiter.  For example, other wait staff would bring us our orders.  But if we asked for anything, like additional water, bier cheese, or whatever, they said they had to get or waiter in order for us to tell that specific person.  That slows down service.  Final Answer Would come back, but wouldn't be a first choice.  Would only return because bringing someone to show them or with others who insisted on coming here",

The place is a cavernous vault with soaring ceilings that reflect the loud, raucous vibe, the German music, and the clank of beer steins on tables.  Pretty cool.  I am  not above enjoying a kitschy appeal to every German stereotype, and I'm definitely not above the beer choices.  I think I might have just had the bad luck to go there when the waitress I got was having a bad day, because her negativity was so pronounced that I whispered to my dinner companion, \"Did I do something offensive?  Why does she hate me?\"  Hard not to have a bit of a pall settle over the experience when you're wondering if your server is spitting in your food for reasons you can't figure out.  Everyone else was great, though, so maybe that was just an anomaly.  The hostess was super cheerful, the musical entertainment was outrageous and fantastic, and it's basically a great place to go to if you're in the mood for a loud, cheerful time.  The one other challenge I experienced is that there's no nearby parking, so having someone with limited mobility in the party is tricky.",

We did not see the sampler on the menu but when one went by we ordered it.

My wife had a pan seared pork chop with burgandy mushroom sauce perfectly tender. The sauteed cabbage was spot on. I had the pork loaf which was like a hot dog flattened and grilled. great flavor.

    "text": "This place confuses my sense of what is right and wrong.  The food is gross, the beer is gross...and yet the beer is so cheap, and there's soooo much of it.  This place has become notorious for getting people drunk enough that they end up murdering somebody with their car.  But I'm not really sure who is really to blame.  Any other bar if you say, \"I'm going to stop by for a couple beers,\" you'll have a wonderful time.  Here, you will be totally fucked.  Because for real, a whole liter of beer for 9 dollars is a God Damn good value, but nobody should consume anything based on liter amounts.  The crowd varies from massive douchebags from the local colleges or new grads just getting blathered at the bar, to sweet old couples and families who actually love polka music, but everybody seems to be having a good time.  The music is fun.  The service is pretty great, and to be honest, the few times I've been here when it's really crowded, there hasn't been any overly rowdy behavior, so the security presence was probably a good idea.  The food, as I said is really very gross.  And there is a thing called the Hot Brown, which makes me immediately think about what's going to be happening to my body at some point in the future.  Don't call something the 'Hot Brown' unless you're a Doctor trying to explain diarrhea to a child as gently as possible.  Other things are not so bad, and I'll admit that at a certain level of intoxication, I will shamelessly eat a plate of sausages like I'm in an eating contest with the devil.  Points as well for the beer garden in the back.  Go here to get drunk, eat gross things, and listen to an old sweetie play polka cover and traditional songs.  But get a fucking designated driver if you're a Dbag that's just going to end up murdering somebody with your car.",

    "text": "I have lived in Pittsburgh for nine years and have always loved coming to the Hofbrauhaus, so now that my boyfriend and I are moving away, we decided to host my birthday party/ our going away party outside in the beer garden by the river. For the most part, we had a lovely time, enjoyed a nice atmosphere with good food and drink and decent service and it was the right venue for hosting all the friends we've made over the last 9 years.  But I feel compelled to add that the end of the evening was unpleasant. I should preface this by saying that my boyfriend and I and most of the friends who were there with us met or currently work in food service and are respectful and understanding of business hours and closing procedures at other establishments. We knew ahead of time that the place closed at 1am, and we had every intention of being ready to go at 1am. But starting at midnight, the wait staff started taking drinks away left and right, rabidly clearing our tables if we dared to look away or visit an adjacent table. Then at 12:30, I was told I had missed last call and I couldn't get another drink. Fine -- I didn't need one anyway, but keep in mind my last one had been taken by an overzealous busser while I was hugging someone goodbye.  At 12:45, we were reminded that we had 10 minutes left to finish our drinks. \"Great, thanks!\" we said, planning to comply. At 12:50, a wall of security guards more or less stood around us, and they brought a police officer over to cross his arms and pretty much just scowl and stare intimidatingly at us as we tried to say our last goodbyes to good friends, which, to say the very least, put a damper on the festivities. I got the sense they were looking for any excuse to kick us out.  If you advertise your hours as being 11:00 am - 1:00 am on a Thursday night, then I think it's only fair to allow your customers to enjoy themselves until the announced closing time. Don't strong arm your customers into leaving before then. We weren't being drunk jerks, we weren't trying to order a lot of food or shots or anything, we were just trying to finish our drinks and say our goodbyes, but the waitstaff and security team just surrounded us with death stares for the last 20 minutes of the night. Had it been 1:15, I'd have completely understood and would have rounded up any oblivious revelers as quickly as possible as part of a cooperative and sympathetic effort, but that was not the case.  If not for that, I'd have given them a 5-star rating, but \"last\" impressions matter, too.",

    "text": "We came here the other weekend with a fairly large group of friends (including a few of their small kids). I have been to the Hofbrauhaus in Cincinnati and done the crazy dude bro drink-and-stand-on-the-tables-all-night experience....for this outing, however, my friends and I came here on a tame Sunday evening for dinner.  Despite it being a Sunday, the atmosphere was still fairly festive, with a loud accordion player gleefully playing German tunes through the hall. Luckily, our big group was seated a bit off to the side out of the main dining room by the bar, so we were still able to hear ourselves talk and think. This was my first time being in the Pittsburgh location, and it looks like it would be really beautiful in the summer -- they have a gorgeous outdoor space that overlooks the river. Unfortunately it was February, so all I could do was look longingly at the patio and wish for warmer days.  So as I mentioned, I came with a fairly large group of friends, which included 3 toddlers. I'm not sure if this made our table undesirable or whatever, but the service was pretty abysmal. Our waitress took forever to take our orders, rarely came over to refill our drinks, and just in general pretty much ignored us the entire time. I don't know if she was just a terrible waitress or if she thought maybe the effort-reward ratio was not favorable enough to put up with such a large group. But either way, it was highly annoying to everyone and soured our experience.  As for the food, it was pretty pricey and was on par with the quality you'd find at, say, an Applebee's. Very run of the mill. I got the Dunkel Bourbon chicken sandwich with a potato pancake in place of the fries. The sandwich was unremarkable -- the chicken breast was oddly shaped (way too thick and too short), so it didn't fill the bun at all. The bourbon sauce didn't have much dimension to it -- it was mostly sweet, with only the slightest hint of tang from the bourbon. Although the sandwich was a bust, I did enjoy the potato pancake -- it was crispy without being greasy and had a delicious onion-flavored potato filling. My friends also felt pretty ambivalent about their meals -- the reuben, the schnitzel sandwich -- every item my group ordered was met with a \"mehh.\" Not terrible but not great (especially for the price).  So my takeaway from this experience is that this is not a place to target if all you're in the market for is a good dinner. Perhaps their wheelhouse is beer and merriment, but food and service definitely ain't it.",

The restaurant was very crowded inside but they had live German music with an accordion. There were even people dancing.We decided to sit at the bar and the service was exceptional.

Hofbrauhaus really strives to set itself apart from the other restaurants in Pittsburgh and it definitely earns its gold star for being quite unique. I also really like the outside seating and the view of the river. Great location! I don't like beer in general so I didn't order their beer.   When it comes to the food and service, however, I thought it's a bit on the lacking side. Our waitress was rude and impatient. I'm not familiar with German food or language, so of course sifting through the menu took longer than wanted. The waitress got a bit snappy when I asked her to explain some items on the menu. I ended up ordering the Ofenfrischer Leberkase, which came with a slice of meatloaf, a fried egg on top and some German potatoes. The meatloaf straight up tasted like processed meat with the rubbery consistency of cheap hotdogs. The potatoes were okay and fried egg tasted like fried egg. I did not enjoy my meal.   Overall, I respect the effort and creative attempt to imitate a German beer hall. The rating I'm giving is a very reluctant 3 for the concept. When it comes to the actual food, I don't think this place lives up to all the hype. I recommend Hofbrauhaus as a place to try for the experience, but definitely not a place I will return to satisfy my taste buds.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday with my wife.  While we have both been to Hofbrauhaus before I don't know that we had ever been there together and so it must have been at least 8 or so years since either of our previous visits.  The reason that we ended up coming here is that we saw that they were having an Ocktoberfest.  Whenever we arrived at around 2 PM the line to be seated was literally out the door and for whatever reason it took about 10 minutes to get seated.  This was weird because there were quite a few empty tables in the dining room and they definitely had servers going to them later.  In any case we were seated in a booth in the beer hall.  Besides the booths there were also giant communal tables and a bar in there.  It was massive with the ceiling a couple of stories tall.  Then since it was Oktoberfest they had an accordion player and for awhile there were dancers as well.  On this day my wife and I were just looking for some appetizers and drinks and so we decided to split the pretzels with beer cheese and then each ordered a half a pint of beer.  I chose the dunkel while my wife went hefeweizen.  Our beers came out first and they were what you would expect of German beers.  While I generally like more exciting beers, these were both good interpretations of their styles and my wife and I both easily drank them.  The pretzels and beer cheese here were also good.  Our beer cheese had a great flavor without too much beer while the pretzels had a nice and crusty exterior and then a soft interior.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both our appetizers and beer were good and I would be interested in trying some of their entrees.",

    "text": "I like Hofbrauhaus, and I hope they never give me a reason to dislike them so much that I would never return, but this past experience was a little frustrating. We went for Oktoberfest and we were prepared to deal with the extra crowds that the event would draw. The crowds and frenzy were there, but for what? One special beer and one \"special\" dish which I would argue that it was actually pretty ordinary being that it was just roast chicken. No other specials, no bands, no price discounts, not really special in any way. The food was good as it always is, but we were expecting something more than just a regular meal at Hofbrauhaus. There also seemed to be some confusion amongst the waitstaff as to what was going on in the Biergarten and terrace. We wanted to sit outside and still hear the music. The hostess said we could sit on the terrace and listen to the music through the speakers when the game was over. Or we could go to the Biergarten and listen to the outdoor band that was starting soon. She told us that the Biergarten was seat yourself but full-service. We opted for the Biergarten.  We found a table and sat for about 10 minutes until someone came to give us menus. The waiter gave us an Oktoberfest Biergarten menu which was just limited selections from the regular menu, this was the only menu that were were allowed to order from. Whatever reasons they have for only offering this limited menu, I'm sure they are logical, but the hostess should have told us that in the beginning. So we had to leave the Biergarten and go back up to the hostess and wait in line to get a seat on the terrace. Meanwhile, there was no band playing outside for our whole meal.  All this for an experience that didn't even feel out of the ordinary considering we had come specifically for Oktoberfest. I would suggest that the hostess disclose that the Biergarten menu is extremely limited in comparison to their regular menu. For Oktoberfest they should either have more bands or publish a schedule. And please don't play the game on TV and over the speakers, especially not during Oktoberfest.  My final critique is that they scheduled what seemed to be a wedding reception at literally the busiest time of the day. If you know you are doing this event, why allow another event to be planned on top of it?!  They need some better organization and logistical planning. The food was good, so 5 stars for that. But zero stars for Oktoberfest, as I wouldn't even call it a fest of any kind.",

Boaters - the courtesy docks make this a convenient spot to eat, and the food and unusual ambiance makes it even better! This was my second or third stop here, but it had been quite a while since the last time. We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess, opting for the air conditioned indoor hall. Our server arrived quickly, and our drink and food orders were taken quickly. Excellent selections to choose from the menu, but I can't speak for the beers as I don't imbibe when boating (or driving).  The food was perfect and delicious upon delivery. My son especially loved the bourbon salmon.  Great spot to stop, by land or sea. Outdoor seating available as well, on the upper deck patio or downstairs. It's worth a visit!",

Dunkle all the way lol. The Hot Brown is a unique but delicious item. They used to be way busier then they are now. As Southside works has more and more place close l, less and less people come. The wait even on the busiest night is minimal. Just use the valet parking when you come. It's not that much more expensive but saves a walk to the restaurant.",

Except in Germany neither me nor our waiter spoke the same language so our group ended up getting a pretzel that we thought initially was a free appetizer. Oh, and the pretzel there only had a side of mustard.  Here, you can get your pretzel with cream cheese and cheese dip along with mustard (Giant Pretzel Combo), and it isn't that expensive. It may be a little bit salty so be ready to take off some of the salt on the pretzel.  We also ordered the Schmankerlplatte, a Bavarian sampler plate that came with Schweinebraten, Schnitzel Wiener Art, and three kinds of Wursts (along with mashed potatoes, fried cabbage, and sauerkraut). Food was very impressive except for the Schnitzel Wiener Art, a chicken dish, which was slightly dry.   Service here is fast and the beer is great! The ambience really gives a German vibe, and it's a great place to bring friends for a night of drinking and feasting. All I would need is to replace the water with sparkling water and I feel like I would be back in Germany again.",

    "text": "Had a lovely evening at Hofbrauhaus on a mini-getaway! It was a Thursday night and we opted to sit in the outdoor patio area upstairs - which provided a great view of the river.  My date ordered a liter of whatever their main dark beer is, and I opted for a half liter of the lighter lager. Both were great accompaniments to our meals, and totally added to the (kind of corny) Beerhall environment. Female servers wear German costumes, but males just wear pants and polos as opposed to lederhosen or some other kind of \"garb\" - which my date and I both noticed and found questionable at best.  The food was mostly great, but please learn from my mistakes and don't go too wild on the beer cheese! I ordered beer cheese spatzle as a side, a risk that simply did not pay off. I think it's their version of Mac and cheese, but the cheese coagulates really fast and it more or less tasteless with a filmy texture. My schnitzel sandwich was epic and my date really enjoyed his pork entree and all of the sides, minus the sauerkraut.  Overall - this is a really great spot for a group hangout or family meetup.",

You can't go here and not get a beer so of course I got one, I tried the mango beer and it was very tasty and surprisingly sweet for a beer.   I also tried the wurst sampler and couldn't decide which was the best. The sauerkraut balls and potato pancakes appetizers were great to share with my very drunk and hungry family.   Entertainment was a lot of fun, even got to hear sweet Caroline played with an accordion. Only reason for one star knocked off is because our food took about an hour. It was worth the wait and I was with family so the time passed but I still wish the food came out sooner. Will still return With my whole family every year like always!",

    "text": "Hofbrahaus is a great place to hang out on a cloudy afternoon and chat with friends!  I had been here once before back in 2011 and enjoyed by time, but in all the subsequent visits to Pittsburgh, never made it back although I ran by it several times when running the trails along the river.  When visiting Pittsburgh recently, Yelp friend Eileen S suggested getting together and mentioned Hofbrauhaus as a possible location and I thought that was a great idea!    We were lucky enough to get a patio seat outside.  It looked like it might rain so we were happy to be there rather than in the beer garden.   It was a very relaxing dining experience, with the mild breeze and the sounds of the accordion player inside creating a mellow back drop to the afternoon.    Service was friendly, but maybe a tad too leisurely, but since we were not in a rush it wasn't a problem.   I really enjoyed the Key Lime Lager I had.  It was light with just a hint of lime.   We all shared a huge pretzel that came with beer cheese and mustard.  When I saw it, I thought we'd never finish it but three of us were able to devour it pretty quickly!  My better half and I split a schnitzel sandwich and it was awesome.  Also plenty for two people!  It was so nice just to be able to chat and have a nice conversation while watching the river go by.  I know inside it gets very loud at the communal tables, which is also fun, but sometimes a more mellow experience is better and in this case, it really was a great way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon.  I'll definitely go back!",

The patio has potential, and has a beautiful view of the river. However, 1/2 of the patio is self service (you have to order from the bar) and the other half is full service. We stopped here because the hostess over the phone told me that dogs were allowed, sadly enough they aren't. You are however able to tie your dog to the fence, and they can sit there looking sad at you the entire time.  The beer is unique, I get it. When I ordered the overly ginormous Dunkel to share, I was surprised when the bartender left so much foam on the top of the beer. And then I noticed that this was a little trick that seemed to be done for all the tables around us as well - clever! If you do this to all customers, all day, looks like Hofbrauhaus is really making out!   Lastly, my salmon salad was so sad. For just under $20 I received iceberg lettuce, with about a 4 oz salmon. Yes, I did like the flavor of the salmon but I left starving!",

It's a pretty loud and boisterous crowd that's typically here so beware if that's not your thing. They almost always have a live performer as well which adds to the experience. I would say the food is okay, nothing too special except maybe the pretzels. Full disclosure, I'm not real big on the German food but the menu is very Americanzied so there's something for everyone. I was trying to be healthy so I had a salad which was excellent if not a little overpriced. The best thing about this place is the beer and atmosphere especially as the night goes on. Definitely worth checking out so grab a stein and sing along.",

I've been several times to the original place in Munich and it does not compare with the real thing. The shell, YES, the beer YES, the food NOPE, the irrational noise level, No!   Do yourself a favor and check out the Munich menu and compare it with the US menu (incl. the low prices in Munich). Unfortunately you will not be able to sample the differences in the food quality, but trust me, it is poor and not authentic on this side of the Atlantic. The owners in Munich should be embarrassed. No way would a Hofbrauhaus from Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Vegas or the other places make it in Germany.  We decided each time to sit outside because of the high noise level inside and enjoyed the beer and the views. What a shame that management has no pride to deliver authentic German food.  I visited in Beijing their competitor Paulaner Brauhaus a few times, their food, beer and ambiance were on par with the Paulaner in Munich. If they can deliver, why can't the Hofbraeuhaus?",

Feeling calmer and older we just sat at the bar and ordered some pretzels and some beers. Pretzels were fine, but was one of the only choices for food late at night unfortunately.  I was amazed at how large the beer was and what a good price it was. They also had add ins. Our bartender was wonderful and let us try samples.  Though I thought it was kind of odd that the female bartenders wore a German uniform. Seems a little old school to me in this day and age.",

Inside was a huge dining area (similar to a mess hall)  and a stage for the German Band. There was easily 300 people!!!  We put our names on the list and went across the street to an Irish bar to kill some time.     An hour and half later, we received a text message that our table was ready.  We ran across the street and was seated.  Sadly,  we were seated in a dining room separate from the main dining area so, we missed out on the camaraderie of the German inspired atmosphere.     Ordered a bourbon chicken  which was cooked perfectly.  Also, ordered a pint of beer and a Bavarian pretzel.    But after our meal we found a spot in the main dining area to enjoy the music and finish our pint of beer.   Overall, we enjoyed our food, the music, the atmosphere and the Beer!!!   Tip: If you wish to try their Crispy pork shoulder, make sure you get there early.  It is a popular dish and they only a certain number a day.",

Since the kitchen was closed, food/drink choices were limited to beer and pub snacks (nachos, chili, and pretzels with various sauces). We ended up getting a round of beers along with all three snacks. The place is definitely very big, which makes it great for groups! I would also say that it was towards the end of the night towards closing so there weren't as many people, although I can only imagine how busy it normally gets during peak afternoon/dinner time. There are a variety of beers that one can get, including the drink specials (one every month), ranging from light to dark beers (stout-like even). Overall, I had a great time eating here. The snacks were all delicious, although I would say that I especially enjoyed the sauce layered on the nachos, which made it quite tempting to pick at again and again. Great place to chill with a group of friends. Will try to come here the next time during normal hours to sample some of their entree/appetizer choices.",

    "text": "+ delicious Bavarian fare and brews, + nice patio with a scenic view, - packed and noisy inside  If you are looking for a typical Bavarian Oktoberfest experience the Pittsburgh Hofbrauhaus branch gets very close. Despite the TV screens showing sport events the interior reminds of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich.  Similar to the interior the menu is Bavarian and convinces with delicious brews and traditional Bavarian and Southern German fare, some of them with an American twist. Make sure you try the battered and fried Sauerkraut balls and the Hofbrau Dunkel beer!   Besides German Oktoberfest Classics the live bands are playing popular American songs to which the crowd starts dancing after their first \"mass\" (a liter of beer).  If you prefer a less busy atmosphere the outside patio with scenic views over Monongahela River is a great alternative during a nice summer evening.  Average price for an entree: $15, price for a \"mass\" (1 liter of beer): $12.  + nice location + scenic view from the large patio + good Bavarian fare and beer - noisy and packed indoors",

This place did not disappoint.  We went on a Saturday night around 6:30 and we walked right up to the hostess stand. No joke though. Two minutes later I turned around and the line was out the door. This place was PACKED.   We were seated pretty promptly and were lucky enough to score one of the booths that flank the main hall. PERFECT seating to watch the debauchery.   The menu is pretty much what you expect. I've been to HB Munich, and this place wasn't much difference. One HUGE difference though. This German girl did not appreciate that the schnitzel was pork not veal.   Service was great despite the ridiculous amount of people in there. There was some sort of ski contraption that people were taking shots from. Provides more and more amusement as the night goes on!   There was a guy singing actual German music for most of the evening. Once it got later though the band came on. They play cover songs. Strangely enough quite authentic as Germans LOVE our cover songs.  The place also has a little shop to buy souvenirs inside in case you want to buy some HB souvenirs.",

Atmosphere - 20, 30, 40 somethings, girl vs guy ratio 2 - 4, frat house, noisy, crowded, massive, messy, spills on your favorite shirt, the majority of people arriving in groups.   Service - Again, it is like a frat house here on the weekends. So service here consists of pushing your way to the bar and sticking your money out to let them know you are ready to order. Summers here are a bit better. The outside bar, which faces the river, has easier access.   Prices - The prices are a bit on the higher side for it being in the SouthSide. Mixed drinks are around $7 and beers around $5 and up.   Food - The beer is decent here, I usually get the Hefe Weizen. I am not the biggest beer drinker so I usually switch to Cap'n and Cokes. I have never eaten here (other than a pretzel) as it is always too crowded. I think the less crowded and less rowdy afternoons are probably a better time to try out their food.   Overall - While I have never had a blast here, as I feel I am getting too old to go, I think the best time to go to the Hofbrauhaus is in the summer months. This is because you can escape the craziness of the main area (lodge?) and head to the bottom level to really enjoy some time down by the river.",

It's a traditional German beer hall with the long tables, the 1 liter beer mugs, and wait staff in traditional German costume. The beer was of course great German beer made by Hofbrau and the food was excellent. I ordered a bratwurst dinner that came with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. I thought the prices were reasonable and the service was good. We ordered pretzels for an appetizer that were perfect. The place can get loud but its expected in a German beer hall.",

The place gets real crowded and loud as the night begins but that is to be expected.   These all sound good until we start talking about food quality. The food was sub-par for its price. If you are looking for authentic German food, you would be disappointed. Nonetheless, I'd recommend getting beer there. If you don't mind crazy crowd, stop by late night to see people singing, stomping on the tables, and getting obnoxious (or you can join the drunks). As for the food? Check out Max's Allegheny Tavern instead.",

    "text": "On the last night of a trip, I usually tend to go to a place that I know will have good beer.  I have been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich.... so it was a no-brainer that I would end up here at some point during my trip to Pittsburgh.   It was a nice night, and the sun was just about set on a nice summer day.  A seat out in the Biergarten was an easy decision.  It was nice to see the old Oktoberfest tables set out with a nice river view.   To start off, we shared the pretzels and bier kasse.  Think about that.  Okay, you got it.  It was pretty much what you think it would be.  Definitely recommend.  I ordered the schweinebraten and my wife ordered the nurnberger sausages.  Unfortunately, they were out of the schweinebraten and I went with an order of the nurnberger sausages as well.  To drink, I had their seasonal Pilsner, and my wife had the hefeweizen.  Later on, I got a dunkel as well.  Everything came on in a timely manner, and tasted pretty much like what we have enjoyed in Deutschland.  The beer, as you would expect, was right on. After dinner, we split the appel strudel, which was very good.  The restaurant was in a great location.  It was right by a riverwalk, which came in handy as we tried to walk off the great meal we just had.  So.... where's the fifth star?  The party next to us asked for mustard and was given Guldens mustard.  While that wouldn't raise an eyebrow anywhere else, this is a German place and you have to get the mustard right.  It would be akin to putting ketchup on someone's noodles at an Italian restaurant.  But all in all, it was very faithful to the original Hofbrauhaus.  Definitely try to stop by here if you have a chance.  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "There are two very important things one needs when dining at Hofbrauhaus: 1) stretchy pants and 2) a designated driver.  The stretchy pants are for comfort after you have gorged yourself on sausages, pork, sauerkraut or any number of German delicacies.  The designated driver is for when you've drunken yourself into a stupor after one gigantic beer.  I've only been there a few times, but each time, I have a decent experience, great food and awesome beer.  Yes, I know I'm breaking my rule about corporate food, but there aren't that many locations (it's not like it's a Chili's - on every corner) so I don't count it as being too, too corporate.  I forgive because the food is actually pretty good.  My one warning is that if you're looking for a nice, quiet intimate place to dine, go elsewhere.  If it's busy, you might be seated at a table with strangers (there are booths, but not too many).  On top of that, Hofbrauhaus is loud even on its slowest afternoons and absolutely nuts on a Saturday nght.",

The schintzel sandwich is probably my favorite thing to eat there.  The place has a live band that usually plays good sing along songs (you are encouraged to stand on the benches but please don't stand on the table)  The shotskis are a fun thing to do with a group (expensive but where else do you get to take a shot off of a ski?)  All in all a good spot to hang out and chill. Once spring/summer rolls around the outside bier garden is a great place to just relax with a liter of beer and shoot the shit with your friends.",

We've come here several times for big get togethers, and I think that's the best upside.  They can easily accomodate large parties, and the waitstaff does a pretty good job in keeping up.  The food itself, though, is just bleh.  I guess I'm just not into German cuisine.  I mean if Heidi Klum is the pinnacle of German beauty then Hofbrahaus is like the Janeane Garafolo of Deutschland dinners.  Then again, they do have a great selection of beer, and Germans know beer.  So put down a few of their pints, and Janeane Garafolo may just magically transform into Heidi Klum! #beergoggles",

That being said, we only visit once or twice a year, usually in the fall as we're fans of their Oktoberfest brew.  The pretzels are great, and my husband had the Jagerschnitzel which he said was amazing.  I honestly don't know how these people expect you to eat a meal after a half liter of beer and two soft pretzels, so I ordered a side of beer cheese spaetzle for dinner.  It's SO GOOD!    I definitely recommend sitting in the biergarden if it's nice out--you don't have to wait, it's self seating, the service is fast and they have a full bar down there as well.  There are twinkly lights strung up between the trees, plenty of bench seating, and you get a view of the river.  Not to mention you don't have to do the chicken dance down there. :)",

This is a beerhouse, you'd think they would know how to pour a beer. On top if that the beer wasn't even cold, just slightly lower than room temp. The pretzels I got were about on par with those frozen soft pretzels you can buy at the grocery store. I paid $10 for the pretzels and $5 for the half liter. Penn brewery is much better than this place, if you want a good German beer house experience go there. This place is more of a German themed Applebee's, if that.",

It brings to Pittsburgh that wonderful German experience, from the delicious German sausages to the huge mugs of beer to dancing on the tables. It can be loud and rowdy, but such is the environment of a German beer house, and there are outside tables for those seeking a quieter night.   Hofbrauhaus is located at the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and the overall area is nice and clean. At the outside tables, you can kick back and enjoy your 1 liter mug while gazing lazily down the river. I would highly recommend, well, everything, but my personal favorite is the liter of Hefe Weizen. One can order the half liter, the 'little beer' as we say, but one should also be aware that such can lead to a night of ridicule and taunts.  Little beer or not, the experience is a must-try, and at the very least, Hofbrauhaus gives you great food and great beer. Have a DD ready, since one can end up drinking quite a lot here. Indeed.",

If you like German food, you probably will enjoy this restaurant. German food is just not my favorite. I had difficulty with finishing all of my sausages. Maybe next time I will more wisely order my food. I am not a beer drinker so did not try their beer. (Yes, why did \"I\" go to \"this\" restaurant?!) My friend said that he enjoyed his food and beer. Prices were moderate. Our waiter was nice and served us well.",

Did not try the beer but would go out of our way to come here for the food.",

Some people like to hate on the haus because it's food isn't super authentic and it's clientele is often frat-tastic, popped collars and all. I look beyond that and see the good beer served in giant mugs, guys dressed in lederhosen playing music, and in my opinion very good food.  Beer: Hofbrauhaus only servers their own beers to you only have a choice of their 4 main beers the Lager, Light Lager, Hefeweizen, and Dunkel. They also have a different specialty beer every month so when you go back you have something different to try.  Food:  I happen to really like their food. I have had several of their dishes and have liked all of them. I have always received good service and the food quality and preparation has always been consistent.   What's not to like. You will have fun when you go here, end of story.",

Great beers, loved the German stein option, the food was really good, the long tables and bier haus is fun.  Everyone at in my group seemed to enjoy their food and beer.  We had a pretzel appetizer, it was good and so was the cheese, not sure the pretzels where homemade or store bought but they went well with the beers.  For me the best part was the atmosphere.  They had a guy playing the accordion and later a stand-up bass player.  Folks where bringing up birthday and anniversary dedications and the player jumped right in with a celebratory sing-along.  The crowd seemed to know what to do and most participated in the sing-along.  We felt real comfortable and it seemed to be full of a mixed crowd of families from seniors to the kids.  We had fun.",

My friend forewarned me how packed this place gets but I wasn't prepared whatsoever. We got there around 7P and got a booth on the side-perfect for the people watching spectacle to come. Got the bier cheese and pretzel appetizer and I wish I could have sucked it up with a straw but inevitably it would have gone right to the booty. Plus I don't think sucking liquid cheese through a straw is socially acceptable?   Then the band started along with a Pens game playing on tv and yeah, the place was madness. I've never seen a place like this before with peeps standing up on their chairs, dancing, drinking and have a merry ole time to Neil Diamond and John Denver jams. And seeing I'm originally from FL and never got into hockey, it was an experience watching a hockey game in the Burgh. The crowd was out of control with security strategically placed throughout the hall ready to break up a fight at any moment (hooray for no crazy frat boys trying to show how ballsy they are!)  When we had to get up to use the restroom, we had to take a few minutes to plan the best route in order to avoid dancing or beer spillage.   Service was ok.....the waitress disappeared for a good while and I don't blame her. Food was good but priced a little too high. Mixed crowed with people of all ages but lots and lots of kiddies. I think it would be a fun place to go to in the summer time with the huge patio they have but other than that, it would be a one in a while kinda place for me to go to. But regardless, still a fun time. Next time, Shot-ski is on the agenda.",

The haus is very welcoming, very authentic, and loads of fun. I definitely recommend the oktoberfest beer and any of their Schnitzel! Heck you might as well just join in the fun during the month of October! All of the appetizers they offer are quite tasty and fun to share. Group seating at the long wooden benches and tables with the occasional German toast that the whole place shouts together makes this one of my favorite places to go when I'm visiting Pittsburgh.",

The wait for a table was long, the place was packed and noisy, and the atmosphere was just annoying (loud drunk people chanting 'USA', god knows why because it's not an American-themed bar).   I ordered a beer and some food, which was chicken and potatoes. Everything seemed really overpriced. When it came out, it was pretty bland and boring, except for the excitement of finding a large lump of plastic in my mashed potatoes. I alerted the wait staff who told me that the potatoes come in bags that are sliced open, and some of the cut-up plastic must have gotten into the meal. The staff were super friendly and replaced it, but it was still a bit of a let-down.  Maybe it would be nicer to go in at lunch time and have a beer and a pretzel or something. For dinner though, I definitely won't be going back.",

On my last visit I was prepared to write a 2 star review but was surprised at the food and service.  In past visits the food has been horrible however on this visit I was pleasantly surprised how good everything tasted. We only had to wait about 15 minutes on a busy Friday night to sit in the main seating area. Our waitress was very prompt (not friendly but she was busy and quick to get our orders and food). I started with the large glass of the wheat beer.  This is not my favorite place for beer and it is just your average German wheat beer.  We went with the pretzels and beer cheese as our starter. I have had bad experiences with the beer cheese tasting like paste but this time it surprised me and was delicious.  For my entree I ordered the club sandwich. I changed a few things on it and they had no problem getting my order straight. I choose the mashed potatoes as my side which were equally as tasty.  All in all a great place to have a drink on a Friday night with friends but eat before you come.",

With giant pretzels and liters of beer.. can't go wrong with that combination. For dinner, I had the jagerschnitzel - pork cutlet topped with burgundy wine mushroom and bacon sauce and my boyfriend had the wiener schnitzel - similar to what I had minus the sauce. Both were really good and big portions.   Wish we could've seen what it was like here on a Friday or Saturday night.",

The grand tables, the ginormous \"dining hall\" (or drinking hall?), the lovely covered terrace - it's all great!  I came here for dinner last night and enjoyed a couple brews (I think I had the one for October? They have a different beer every month! AMAZING). I started with the pretzels and biercheese and ordered the spatzle with chicken and mushrooms. The biercheese was definitely the highlight of the meal - fresh homemade pretzels and a light (but still rich) cheddar beer dip. I literally have a craving for these at least once a week!  The spatzle was pretty good, but nothing exciting. For those of you like me who have never really eaten German food before, spatzle is a dense, egg noodle that vaguely resembles gnocchi. The Heidelberger Rahm Spatzle (what I got) consisted of chicken breast, marsala cream sauce, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. My boyfriend got the Kasespatzle (like a mac 'n' cheese) and that was super rich, but very tasty. I'd recommend splitting that one.  Service and atmosphere were great, food wasn't bad. I'd definitely come here again for a round or two and some biercheese!",

We really wanted to go there because we are planning to go to Oktoberfest this year, and what a better place to prepare than the Hofbrauhaus, right? It was so much fun!  We weren't able to get a table in the main room at first so we went to the side room where we got some appetizers, and a few people got meals. I enjoyed looking over the menu at some of the traditional German dishes. If you are not a fan of German food, then don't expect to like their food. I rather enjoyed the things I tried - including the weiner schnitzel, the kraut balls, and the pretzels.   The beer was really good too and pretty cheap. I tried the Premium Lager, the Hefe Weizen, and the Dunkel. I liked the Premium the best, but the others were good too. You got a ton of beer for the cost, and I was even able to buy the stein for an extra $10 to add to my beer boots and steins collection.   We also enjoyed doing some shot skis, where we all lined up and downed a shot together. One of my friends was the short one on her ski and got a shot in her eye - so just make sure the taller folks bend down a bit! It was pretty funny though.   Once the main room opened up a bit, we headed over there to dance on the tables and cheers each other with our steins. It was a really fun night, and I would definitely recommend a trip there if you are into Oktoberfest-type or binge-drinking activities. Fun times indeed!!",

I was there on a Monday before a Pirates game.  Not many people there.  Great location, right on the water.  Friendly staff.  Seats 800 and I was told they get to standing room only on the weekends.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time yesterday instead of Max's on North Side.  The open dining area felt like an authentic German hall sort of thing -- kind of like what I would imagine the German hall at Busch Gardens in Williamsburg would be like.    Service was pretty good.  For an appetizer, we got pretzels and bier cheese.  It was pretty tasty, but the bier cheese was kind of dry and stuck to the roof of my mouth (but it was totally worth it).  Ordered the schnitzel cordon bleu, which is fried veal, ham, and bier cheese on top, and for sides I substituted with a potato pancake and sauerkraut.  The food was really good and fresh, although the bier cheese was still pretty dry (maybe that's how it's supposed to be, I don't know.)  Overall, I had a pretty good experience here at the Hofbrauhaus, although I would still choose Max's over it.",

Last night they had open seating which was fun for us and we got a chance to share a table with some folks who were a blast. We ate and a German band was setting up in traditional garb. They had two accordions in the band and I figured we were in for an evening of traditional German beer hall music - I was way wrong. These old guys were doing cover songs! Great sing along songs which were great. If you just want to sit and eat quietly don't sit in the main hall. In a few minutes everyone was standing on their chairs singing and dancing. It was a blast. Oh and the beer - great German variety and it was excellent.",

    "text": "I wish, I wish, I wish we had one of these in St. Louis.  First, apparently this is actually a replica version of the actually Hofbrauhaus that they have in Germany (so my friend who actually went said). So. Pretty cool on that front. Thankfully, there aren't drains in the floor of this one like there are for the one in Germany...  They're a German beer hall so so course you have to get the beer steins. They're pretty big. Each stein is probably about 2.5 cans of beer.   The food is decent. The pretzels with cheese are actually really good. Get them. I also got a plate of spatzle with chicken breast, and like everything else here, the plate was huge. I finished it all but I don't know how I did it and I kind of wished I hadn't. Later, we got the ski shots, which are basically just 4 shots on a ski and you have to drink it all at the same time.  The atmosphere in the beer hall: you either love it or hate it. It's rowdy. It's loud. There's people standing on benches. (Surprise revelation of the night: Sweet Home Alabama is apparently a popular song in Pittsburgh.) They do have a great beer garden outside for when the weather is nice and you just want to get it away from all the ruckus inside.  For dessert, we had the apfel strudel and the chocolate layer cake. I really liked the chocolate layer cake though it was at the point in the night when I probably could have cared less what was for dessert.",

The beer itself was just standard, nothing special, but it seemed a little too easy to drink a beer the size of my head... so they have something going for them.   All we go to eat was pretzels, and they were good, but also nothing too special.

    "text": "We were pretty disappointed in our visit to the Hofbrauhaus. I hadn't been there in years and mom has never been but we checked it out. It was Father's Day, so we knew it'd be busy. We grabbed 2 seats at the bar vs waiting the 20-30 min for a table. Initially, our bartender/server, Sara, was timely and responsive but over time, this attention all but disappeared. The bar seats were all taken but I did notice that the people to my right had a different server than we did. We ordered within 10 min of sitting, including an appetizer, and our beers were brought out in a normal timeframe. However, after at least 30-40 min, we asked Sara where our pierogies were and she made a face that told me she forgot about them and said she'd go check. When she returned, she had the app and stated the plate was very hot, an indication it had been sitting in the heat window for quite some time. The pierogies were very hard to break apart with the fork, as thick flour/potato might be when it's been microwaved or sitting in a heat lamp for too long. Then, after another at least 40 min, we asked where our meals were. Sara said the kitchen was pretty backed up but when we pointed out that the ppl next to us (who arrived 20 min after we ordered) and the table of 6 behind us who also sat after us had received their meals, she said she'd send the manager over. The manager heard our same complaint about others getting their food long before us, he went back to the kitchen to check on our order and came back with it about 5-10 min later. The food had very obviously been replated. Mom had ordered roast chicken and I a bratwurst hotdog, both with potato salad. The plates were cold and the chicken and bratwurst were both lukewarm - not freshly cooked so I'm assuming they'd been sitting in heat lamp for so long but they had to change plates due to their heat. We were never spoken to by Sara again. The manager took our beers off the tab and 2 separate servers checked on us while we ate. I don't think I'd be as irritated or disappointed if Sara had just held herself accountable for forgetting about us with both the app and the meals. She just seemed very nonchalant and unphased by the busy-ness around her. I don't know if others in her station were waiting this long but it was definitely noticeable her lack of attention vs others in the bar area. The beer and atmosphere were nice but this experience was too disappointing and we likely won't be back.",

Most especially when it is nice enough to enjoy the outdoor biergarten along with the views of the city and the river.  Maybe it's the German in me, or the beer in me, or the German beer in me?  Eh either way you put it, I'm down with it.  Now I haven't eaten here but on a few occasions.   The food is good enough.  No particular stars or duds that I can recall.  I love German food, but their version is much more Americanized.  It's okay though, since the South Side offers so much in the way of eateries I am happy to just come and spend a couple hours in the sun downing a liter of brew.     Our last visit here was great.    Perfect weather over the Labor Day weekend led to a great afternoon trying their September style Oktoberfest that is brewed in Munich.  I loved it.  Nice seasonal balance of flavors, served in a huge been stein, you just can't go wrong there.  When I do come here I tend to try their seasonal selection first, there are many that are very good.    Sometimes this place can get crazy, and if you aren't into that kind of atmosphere I recommend coming in the afternoons.   I would probably never come here in the evening again, though I have heard they cracked down on their tolerance of bozo drunken idiots.  This is always good to hear.  Bottoms up!",

We had a group of eight and were seated on the deck since it was a gorgeous day.  We arrived and were seated by 12:15.  After waiting 10 minutes, a waitress appeared and asked if anyone wanted drinks.  I ordered a Diet Pepsi and my coworkers all stuck with water.  The waitress left and we waited.  And waited.  And waited.    At 12:40 when we still had not ordered, I went inside and flagged down a busboy, explaining that we were on a limited schedule and had not even gotten drinks yet.  He apologized, grabbed a waitress, and immediately came to take our order.  They said they had gotten crushed all the sudden and assured us our food would be out right away.  At 12:45 (half an our after we had arrived)  they finally brought my soda and said again our food was on the way.  At 1:05 when we still had not gotten any food or seen our server, I once again went inside and flagged down a bus boy, saying that we would need our food packed to go as we no longer had time to eat.  He promised it would be taken care of right away.  At 1:10 our waitress brought out a birthday sundae with a candle in it, which-- while incredibly thoughtful-- was not helpful since we still had not gotten out meals.  She said again our food would be out \"soon\" and I said again that we needed it to go.  We also asked for our checks.    At 1:15 we were finally given our checks (though we still had gotten any food) and discovered that the checks were incorrect.  We paid the incorrect checks anyway because by then we were starving and late.    At 1:20-- over an hour after we arrived-- we finally got our cold food to go.  This was a terrible and embarrassing birthday experience.  We ended up eating cold food in a meeting because of this.  There was no adjustment to our (incorrect) checks.  Despite working across the street from here, none of us will be back any time soon.",

Everyone liked what they had; the portions were large; everything was hot; prices were a little high; and our waitress was pretty absent after the food was delivered. The service definitely could've been better. Overall it was a three star night.",

There was plenty of outdoor seating, so it wasn't bad at all.  we finally got seated and it took a few minutes to get ordered but I expected that since it was packed. Every seat was taken. I had some wine because I'm really not much of a beer person.  The wine was super delicious.   The food was really good. I know had spinach dip. My boyfriend had schnitzel and he loved it.   The experience is where the 4 star comes in people dancing on tables and singing covers of songs. It's really fun and definitely worth the trip at least once.",

The food is actually quite good and the beer - though not so good as to make me tear up - is good. This place gets PACKED, though, so I suggest either getting there early or else heading down to the outside picnic tables. The scene there is much more relaxed and the view is great.  BEER SELECTION: Lagers all, with the occasional altbier. Solid, but not overly impressive. FOOD SELECTION: Traditional german stuff with an emphasis on sausages. Good and well priced. SERVICE: It gets noisey in the hall, what with the singing, yelling, cheering, and dancing, so you'll have to forgive the waitstaff if they always seem to be in a rush.  Shotskis are to be shared with four people. Jager and Honey Jager shots are poured into shot glasses glued to a ski, then drank at one time by the participants. Have fun!",

IMO the hefeweizen is a bit heavy with the banana and clove but perhaps that's how a True hefeweizen  should taste like.   I get annoyed inside with repetitions of living on a prayer, sweet caroline, sweet home alabama and steelers fight songs so I'm almost always outside. The people there eat it up but having already experiencing four years of drunk idiots singing journey, experiencing it again is nauseating.   The kids are young, Many 21 year olds chose this place to celebrate their coming of age. But really the clientel ranges from these 21 year olds to 80 year olds attempting to get jiggy with it.   Outside is very nice, ample seating and nice views.  Its a great pace to take visitors to see something they can't see everywhere.   Overall, a place to go with friends to enjoy a beer before heading somewhere else or a place to linger all night if that's your thang.    Like tanqueray, hofbrauhaus is good only in moderation.",

We decided on dinner and a movie and we wanted to try some place we hadn't been to before.  Hofbrauhaus tries to replicate the 400 year old Hofbrauhaus in Munich.  Now since I'm 1/2 German, I thought this place would really appeal to me.  For an appetizer, we started on the pretzels with beer cheese.  I think that they are freshly baked, but they certainly are so delicious.  My main course was the Wursteller, which was Mettwurst, Bierwurst, and Bratwurst.  Piled high with sauerkraut (I love 'kraut.  Why-oh-why do I love stinky foods?), and mashed potatoes, it was so good.  They reportedly have great burgers here too.  No visit to a good German joint would be complete without dessert.  So we split two orders of Appel Strudel with vanilla and raspberry sauce.  I shared one with my friend Marla.  Sherry and Maryann split the other.  Like I always say, \"Pump that insulin, Susan, pump!\"  One thing, this place can get very busy, so it's best to go early like we did.",

I don't want to yell over the oompah band  the entire time I'm trying to hang with friends.  I'd find the music tolerable if I was drinking heavily. But people come here for the atmosphere knowing what they are getting into...so Im not going to rate this place based on my dislike for something that is at the heart of the business. So with all this being said...I had a good meal last week.  Had a gift certificate there and needed to wait out traffic. I got lucky coming in early in the evening because it wasn't the full band....considerably more quiet.  I ordered the Sauerbraten....really flavorful.  If you don't like traditional sauerkraut, this dish comes with red apple kraut.  Awesome.  My BF had the pork with crackling.  This dish is insane.  Wish I had taken a photo of it.  If you love pork and the fried pork skin....heaven.  For me it was a bit too much work to get the right amount of pork and the right amount of cracklin in each bite to make it nicely flavored. But if you have the time while drinking your huge liter of beer....then go for it.",

    "text": "Ah German food, so simple in execution but yet the results are so pleasing.  For those that aren't familiar with German food, here's a crash course on what to expect:  generous helpings of meat, veggies, and beer.  The brand new Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh's Southside Works is no exception.    I've been here several times, both before and after traveling to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany earlier this summer.  I'm happy to say that the experience here is as close as you can get to the \"real\" thing.  The beer hall is loud, you share your table with complete strangers, beer is served by the liter, and often times there is live German music (did I mention that dancing on the tables is encouraged?).  The food is very good and a great representation of the German style.  But what you'll really come here for is the beer.  Brewed on the premises under direction of the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law), they include a Lager, Light Lager, Dunkel, Weizen, and a seasonal brew.  At prices just under $8 per liter, it's a steal compared to other bars in the Southside.  Even if there a few Americanized touches here and there, it feels like an authentic German experience right in your back yard.  What more could you ask for?  Prost!",

Walked into some old guy playing keyboard version of Journey's \"Don't stop believing\" and a few young dudes standing on tables, swaying back and forth singing along.  The whole of Pittsburgh doesn't have enough polka outfits to pay each to play one night of the week?   I had German friends complain at how ridiculous Hofbrauhaus in Munich was, but if they saw this, I think they'd want to shoot themselves.  Also, I found the original in Munich not so bad- decent prices, decent food, and mostly full of older german couples or men!  Maybe during Oktoberfest it's awful, but I liked it.   This was just pathetic- the \"german dishes\" were quite frankly terrible.  I forget which sausage my husband ordered, but he said it tasted just like breakfast links.  I ordered the kasespaetzle, a dish I ate a lot of and liked in Germany.  The two versions can't even be compared.  This one was full of nearly raw onions and tasted like it was covered in alfredo sauce, and was pretty much one big lump of doughy noodle.  The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because the beer was good (though not being a beer connoisseur I can't really compare to the original).  I was a little peeved when I wanted to order a radler (my other favorite in Munich, along with the mushroom and potato dumplings which were absent from the menu here) and my 20something should be at TGI Fridays waitress gave me a blank look.   I didn't go here for fun or spectacle, and that is where I went wrong.  Maybe it'd be more up my alley if I ordered a \"shot-ski\" and burned off my tastebuds.",

The guy waiting on us was a complete angel-- I'd go INSANE if I had to wait on that many plastered barely legals on a regular basis, but he seemed genuinely unbothered.",

We arrived at about 5 PM and were seated without waiting and had a high chair waiting for us at the table. It was a perfect place to take our child because it is loud, even outside.  My wife and I each started with a beer (The Hef and Pils) and were pleasantly surprised by the taste. We sampled the three different dipping sauces for the soft pretzels and found them all to be very delicious. Finally, we split a wedge salad and the dunked chicken sandwich. Both meals were prepared well and served promptly. All of the service was perfect and the pacing of the meal was slightly slower than you might expect for a chain restaurant, which we both appreciated.   I would recommend this restaurant for families and would say that on top of being family friendly it is also wallet friendly.  Cheers!",

The ambiance is nice and open. over all a thumbs up.",

The beer brewed is very good and I can tell they serve it with pride.  Came the first night quite late for some drinking / pretzel eating, and most of all.. standing on the benches signing along with the polka band, making new friends and having a drunken good ol' time.  i wish they would have more of these establishments, as it was high positive energy the entire night! The songs were all very sing-a-long-able... especially the song about Alice!  Next day I came back for an actual meal. The latkas were absolutely amazing, and I had the wurst sampler. All three were extremely good, and I am not sure which one I would choose if i had to choose one. Paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, it was a match made in heaven. The patio was open the day we went, so we got to enjoy the views of the river as well.   Great meal, great beer, great times! I will definitely be back!",

The atmosphere at Hofbrauhaus makes the visiting this establishment worthwhile. There is an eclectic group of people all indulging in heavily encouraged drinking while listening to upbeat traditional folk music. There are also skis for drinking beer; if that means something to you then Hofbrauhaus has it; if that sounds like nonsense then go to Hofbrauhaus to see what I mean.  If you are willing to participate in the high energy cheering and singing, then you'll definitely enjoy an evening here.  When I came here we ordered a few samplers, pretzels, and bratwurst to share. I have no standard to compare the authenticity to, but the quality was surely acceptable.  As for beer, Hofbrauhaus brews its own beer on site. You can order a sample of the house beers and go from there. Also, I've read that Hofbrauhaus serves Cask Ales, but I cannot confirm this from memory.",

Right on the river with a great view and some fun activities.   - If you are looking for a fun, rowdy vibe in a place that isn't dirty and completely nuts, this is the place.  It's a good drinking atmosphere.    The so so... - The food.   My companion grew up in Germany and wasn't impressed with any of it.   As an American, I thought half of what we ordered was really good.  Half was really not.   The winners were the pretzels with bier cheese, the potato pancakes, and the cob salad.   The pork shank with cracklins, the pierogies, sauerkraut, and cabbage were all not so great.    - The portions.   They must be trying to compete with their ridiculously over-portioned neighbor, the Cheesecake Factory, because every dish we ordered was humongous.  Not a lot of healthy options to begin with and the portions are over the top.   I recommend sharing for sure.    - The music.  They had an accordion player in all of the traditional garb.  He stopped at prescribed intervals to sing some German song and make a toast.  It was cute the first time, but quickly became repetitive.   Would probably have been fine if we were there for drinking and not dinner, but as it was, we were sort of over it.    A couple of other things to know.    - Valet service is $8 and the area where I had to pull it was pretty far from the front door.  When leaving, I had to walk out in the rain to get to the valet stand.  He told me I could wait inside and he'd come get me, but that was only after I asked.  Several people were standing out in the rain waiting for their cars. - If you are there to eat, request a table closer to the bar (and farther from the music).  We had to shout to be heard over the accordion.",

The bang for the buck is there (even though we didn't buy last night, thanks to a great friend).  We went for a boat ride - a boat ride with grownups only.  There are plenty of spots to tie up, but then you've got to walk into the city to get where you want to be.  SouthSide Works was our go-to last night because of the new marina there.  We tied up, hopped out, and were sitting at a table at Hofbrauhaus within 5 minutes.  Chose to sit outside because the weather was phenomenal.  ~ Use the No-Wait app ~ Sit outside if the weather is good.  Its loud in the main room, and it can be fun, but i prefer it only in the winter for some reason. ~ Get the smaller beer, the big beer glass is wicked heavy ~ They have a Gluten Free menu & a kids menu  And do eat?  I'm a big fan of the Works Sampler to get started.  Its a little bit of everything that you probably want to try.  I like schnitzel, so I prefer the Bauern Schnitzel - put beer cheese & ham on it, all good.  IPA-hole went with Wurstplatte.  I was hoping someone would get the weiner art.  No one did.",

We only went for a drink and because I have never been there. The service was great and we got a seat at the bar right away. Little did we know, it was $3.00 beer night at 9 o'clock. Once we sat down for a minute and relaxed, we saw the band and I got excited. I have heard you can dance on the tables with your beer and have a great time. Once I looked up, I saw a rush of people coming in (mostly college students). It was a lot of fun and great atmosphere, just really crowded.  Since it got so busy we only got the pretzel appetizer with their beer cheese. Neither of us typically like beer cheese but we liked theirs! It was really good. We will definitely be back to try more food.  It is a great place for groups of people. I would recommend a table with a group of people rather than the bar on a night like that.

    "text": "I still don't get the fascination with Hofbrauhaus. Working close by has led to countless happy hours there, and living close by has led to meeting friends there quite a bit...which means I've been there a lot, but rarely because it was my destination of choice.  First, the beer is good and plentiful. Heck, depending on the monthly brew, the beer is sometimes REALLY good, and the food is decent. I've never eaten an actual meal at Hofbrauhaus, but I've tried almost all of their apps since I'm typically there for happy hour, and they're all pretty good. Fried pickles, fried sauerkraut balls, soft pretzels with beer cheese...I mean, what's there to complain about? The perfect app menu for beer-accompaniment.  Unfortunately, Hofbrauhaus loses me with the atmosphere. I'm fully aware that it's the atmosphere that is supposed to be the draw, and based on the crowds they get, it's working. Perhaps I've outgrown the old get-drunk-then-stand-on-a-table-and-toast-in-a-language-that-I-don't-really-know stage of my life, but I often find the main room of Hofbrauhaus to be loud and obnoxious as opposed to celebratory. Granted, I prefer being able to hear the people I'm talking to, and I don't need a random Tuesday in the Spring to feel like Octoberfest, but based on the number of people that go to Hofbrauhaus, I'm clearly in the minority.  The safe bet for a good time at Hofbrauhaus for those of us looking for a more relaxed experience that takes advantage of the positives of Hofbrauhaus while skipping the annoying, is this: get a small group of friends and hit the outside beer garden when the weather is nice. There are few things more relaxing than partaking in a delicious liter of beer in the beer garden...next to the river...on a sunny day. If the weather isn't cooperating, another option is to get there early before the craziness starts in the evenings, but regardless of how happy the tunes from the accordion might sound, the drab environment just never does it for me.",

The food is traditional German fare. From your standard schnitzel to giant pretzels with beer cheese. You really can't go wrong here. Once the music starts playing, the food is served, and the beer is flowing you will soon find yourself pounding a beer on the table yelling \"Prost\" out loud with the rest of the diners.  You have to experience this place at least once to understand, but it will be so worth it!",

A huge restaurant/pub with plenty of seatings and good atmosohere, and they have their own beer brewing machineries, so their beer tastes extra refreshing. Well, for my food, I ordered the pierogies, and it was okay but didn't really impress me. In fact, it was greasy for me. The dish came with pierogies, cabbages, frizzled onions, and sour cream. Like I already said, Hofbrauhaus will be a good place to hang out with your friends and drink some beer with buffalo wings or something but not a place to go if you are craving a delicious meal.",

My husband is from Bavaria & it is our favorite German food in the burgh. They have an extensive menu with tons of mouth watering options. You're sure to find something you like. I'm even a vegetarian and have had plenty of options to choose from. Their veggie burger on a pretzel bun with beer cheese is delicious. The nachos without meat & the appetizer sampler (minus the sauerkraut balls) are also good meat-free options.   The atmosphere is so fun at the Hofbrauhaus. It's a great place to go with our son because he is often entertained with a live band. In the summer, be sure to get a seat outside in the beer garden for a great seat along the river.   Always had great service even when the servers are slammed.   Overall love this place.",

We had a wonderful time in the afternoon, and were treated very nicely by our wonderful waitress. However, after the wedding, the bride and groom planned an after party here as well. This started out as a pleasant experience. We bought ample amounts of food and drinks, and spent a significant amount of money. However, about an hour into the night, our waitress, Stephanie, refused to serve half of our party, claiming she did not feel comfortable serving them. They were not visibly intoxicated whatsoever. She handled the situation very poorly, informing her manager that we had an issue. However, she walked away to avoid any form of confrontation, even though she was the root of the entire problem. We were an extremely calm and peaceful group causing absolutely no problems. We also spent at least $100 BEFORE she decided to tell us we were no longer welcome. Glad she got her tip from us and then decided to no longer serve us. Extremely disappointed in this place, and certainly left a very bad taste in my mouth about the city of Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, the bride was also extremely upset. Way to ruin the day for everyone, Haufbrauhaus.",

What about the beer, you ask?  It is no better than okay and often served at the wrong temperature.  More than once, I've received a glass of beer that was damned near room temperature...and no, not all the beers on their menu should be served that warm.. Even when served at the proper temperature, their beers are not remarkable.  They aren't even as good as Sam Adams, which I consider to be just over the line into being good.  With the growth of brew pubs in the region, there are about a jillion places that have better beer.  German restaurants are pretty sparse around here, I concede, but I'm not sure that is much of a reason to choose this place for dinner.  That brings me to the wurst part of going here. (See what I did there?)  IT'S REALLY REALLY NOISY!!!!!11!  There's generally some mook wrestling an accordion to its death and several caucasians of Chads fist bumping and bro-ing at the tops of their voices and the inevitable drunken Yinzers yinzing their lungs out.

I've sampled many of their offerings but I've found my niche with the sauerkraut balls as an appetizer (dip them in the honey mustard - wow!) and the comforting, creamy and delicious Rahm spatzle.

The noise and the crowds mean that you need to go there for the express purpose of enjoying the aforementioned other stuff.  There's no doubt it's a fun place; it's just that Hofbrauhaus is not my idea of fun.   I feel a bit bad about writing a critical review without suggestions for improvement, as it's the whole corporate concept that's not to my taste.  The point of this review is to suggest that there are so many better options for grown ups to drink a beer in Pittsburgh, especially if conversation is a goal.  If watching sports, singing, and getting smashed are goals, then you might have a heck of a fun time.",

Food is always hot and well seasoned and I have always had good service here - despite the obvious fact that this place can really get crowded and extremely busy.

But they weren't super warm and there wasn't any mustard or cheese to dip them into. But they were decent. There was also brisket, then breaded cutlets of chicken (I think)-is that schnitzel?, some chicken in a mushroom sauce and a few other things, although I don't remember them because I didn't eat them.  The chicken cutlet was good, but could have used some sauce or something. The chicken in the mushroom sauce was deelish, and the brisket...was not brisket. Okay, remember I said it was dark in there? And I may have had a couple beers or so, but I took a bite of the brisket and was like. Woah. Not brisket. Not brisket. I had to ask my friend and she said \"Of course not, you silly Texan, it's pickled sauerkraut!\" So yeah. Not at all brisket.  We had apple strudel for dessert and that was good stuff! But the meal was just okay. Again, it may have been just me and my tastes.  I should be back here next year for the business meeting, and if they have dinner here again, of course I'll go, but I definitely won't get the \"brisket\"!",

The German menu items are Americanized.  I didn't like that fact, but others may appreciate it.  For example, bacon on the Jagerschnitzel?  Spaetzel was perfect, but the German potato salad was a bit too sweet.  Other than that, great place to hang out and drink with friends.  Will be back!",

Food:  Mediocre, but I don't like German food so not the best judge.  Pretzels and cheese app was excellent.

The tavern is celebrating October fest. Seating is communal so everyone is friendly and singing and drinking together. I had a liter or two or three of their own October Fest beer. It was very good. It had a crisp taste and a nutty finish. My wife had the lager. It was late when we arrived so we just ordered some appetizers. We shared the pretzels, cheese and bacon fries, and perogies. Everything was home made and delicious. Only down side is the line to be seated. I definitely recommend Hofbrauhaus for some awesome craft German beer, and a fun atmosphere. Btw all staff are wearing outfits from German taverns.",

First strike against was a bit of chaos in the front, with hopeful diners started to pile up with no greeters. However, once we were seated, the fun began. We had live entertainment with an accordionist deluged with announcing birthday after birthday throughout the evening...apparently this is a popular birthday spot! Nice big place that managed to feel cozy at the same time.  Second strike was by not even 7pm, their most popular pork dish was already sold out! So I had the ribeye instead. It came out medium well instead of medium rare as I ordered it, but it didn't stop me from devouring it. It was delicious as was the food in general (we had the soft pretzel appetizer that hit the spot, too).  I haven't been to a real German Oktoberfest, but with the outfits the servers (all female, it seemed) wore, it was kinda like a Teutonic Hooters!",

Some people complain about the parking and that you may have to walk a whole block to eat here. Well it is a city and that's unfortunately how it is. Some other reviews talk about how the bands are loud and it's not some quaint restaurant. Well this is supposed to mimic a sort of beer \"tent\" at Oktoberfest, not be the French Landry.  Bottom line is if you want good German food and beer, this is the place. The sauerbraten and schnitzels are great. The service is very good and so is the atmosphere. For anyone looking at this review, ignore the idiots that gave a low rating. They are most likely snobs. I've eaten here with people that had lived in Germany for a long time and even they told me it was very good. I will continue to try different items here.  So there ya go",

I stopped in on my long drive home from Thanksgiving since I knew I would be driving through Pittsburgh. So glad I did!  I started with some warm, soft pretzels and beer cheese and a half litre of Dunkel (a house brew) that never fails to be delicious. Then went with the Bavarian platter for two that included some delicious sauerkraut, spatzle, schnitzel, fried cabbage, pork loin, and wursts! Overall a very nice spread and everything was extremely satisfying.   Typically though based on past experiences I would favor the Jagerschnitzel. It's deeeelicious.   The real winner of this whole experience though is the dessert. Apple strudel that is so to-die for. Warm, perfectly sweet and satisfying. This is the one thing you HAVE to try if you are coming here.   Hofbrauhaus is an amazing German experience you have to try!",

All of it tasted great and came out hot. I also really enjoyed their Original Lager beer, it had a crisp finish and wasn't too hoppy. The atmosphere here is one of the best parts.

Big wooden tables with wide wooden booths for you to stand and dance on. They usually have a live band dressed in German attire of course on the weekends. The band is pretty good and plays popular songs. Don't get me wrong if you've had a few drinks this place can be a good time just not somewhere I'd frequent. I can't speak for the food as I've never eaten here and honestly I probably never will. If anything I'd try a soft pretzel at the very most.

Taste is great and portions were reasonable but not too large (unfortunately). I like that all the waitresses were in German outfits. Management and staff were nice. One staff member cleared the way to the private bathroom with a changing table for my baby through the drunken crowd so I really appreciated that!   Location is cool because it's right next to the riverfront trail. I'm thinking we'll be back in the summer or spring! Prices for entrees are between $16 - $28 so a little on the high side. No free bread or pretzels :(. I got the apple strudel dessert and while the presentation was beautiful, the taste of the pastry was bland and soggy.

This place offers a unique experience of dancing on your seats while the music plays. This is super fun, but do not step on the table, since that will lead to ousting. The beer garden is also fantastic, but it's open only during the warm months. The balcony is just like any other outdoor seating, but you get a really nice view of the river.  All their beers are amazing. The original, the hefe weizen, the dunkel, and the red beer. They also have a seasonal option. The red beer is probably my favorite. The last time I was there, I had 2 liters of that!   I'm not a big fan of their food, but a lot of my friends swear by it. This place is definitely a must go.",

    "text": "This is a nice place to go for an authentic German beer and meal. I am not a huge fan of German food, outside of a warm pretzel, so this is probably not the best place for me. The beer list is, as going with tradition, a little limited. I think they only had five on draft last time I was there. My favorite types of beer are stouts and IPAs, sadly these were not available. The atmosphere is good and likely very good during Oktoberfest. There is live music and the service is solid. Located in the south side on the river, this is an easily accessible location with lots of seating including outdoor.",

    "text": "3.5 experience. First dinner in Pittsburgh! Also, my first time trying German food!   Party of 4, reservation at 7 pm. TBH, it was pretty empty when we came...but I hear it gets hella packed later at night and on weekends!   Parking: street or parking structure a block away. The area is still under renovation, so please pardon the dust.   Menu: extensive and the font is hard to read (LOL). Separated into:  appetizers, soups, salads, side dishes, burgers & sandwiches, HB specialties, Wurstl, Schnitzel, and Haus favorite.   TLDR;  Service: 4/5- Ladies were super nice and gave us ample time to order. But, they did forget us halfway through the meal...  Ambiance: 4/5- indoor has a country band playing on stage, and a really nice bar with huge beer tanks. Outdoor seating that overlooks the river. They even have games on the bottom floor! The area is a new shopping center, so you should walk around after your meal if it isn't too dark or chilly! There is also a running trail behind the restaurant.   Quality of food: 3/5- maybe this isn't my type of food, but for what it's worth, I would only categorize this as \"American traditional\".   Pricing: 3.5/5- pretty reasonable for the quantity you get! Alcohol is also decently priced.   We finally ordered:   SOUPS 1. 2 Kartoffelsuppe (creamy potato soup) // YUM! Isn't this just like clam chowder without the clams? 2. 1 gulaschuppe (beef stew with tomato/paprika base) // YUM! Maybe because I was on the plane all day, but this settled my tummy.  SPECIALTIES 1. Scheweinebraten (slow cooked pork roast) // Oh wow, big portion! I actually really like the pork. Kind of reminds me of pork loin though? Potato dumpling was not bad...why are people obsessed with this?  2. Sauerbraten (marinated beef) // Oh boy...too much red wine sauce. The beef was also too dry...but the sides were good!  3. Dunkel bourbon salmon (pan seared Atlantic salmon fillet) // Yum! Fresh. Also came with some steamed vegetables.   WURSTL 1. Wurstplate (bierwurst, bratwurst, frankfurter) // I'm not into sausages...my friend ordered this and finished it clean though!  HAUS FAVORITE 1. Half rack of baby back ribs // YUMMM. I haven't had good ribs in forever!!! I like. Better than other places I've had in CA!   Overall, interesting dining experience. I wouldn't mind coming here for some big portion, comfort food! However, quality does sacrifice. Everything is hella rich in flavor...maybe too much.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this place yet but let me share my qualifications:  1) I grew up in Germany 2) I used to have German citizenship 3) I speak German fluently and visit relatives often  4) My German family is from southern Germany 5) I've been to Munich and the Hofbrauhaus more than once   Despite all the above I give Hofbrauhaus 4 stars, and here's why:  THE BEER. The beer is actually legit! It tastes 100% like a True southern German Hefeweizen should taste. How they did it I don't know. I will confess that given the vast number of breweries in Germany I was never a regular drinker of Hofbrau. So it's possible that there may be subtle differences here vs there. I mean the water alone could cause that. HOWEVER, it's better by far than *any* imported keg of German Hefeweizen, I don't care if it's Weihenstephan or Paulaner or Franziskaner or whatever. You get my drift. The beer here is 100%  Forget the food. It's fine. Some of it is legit (regular schnitzel, regular Spatzle, red kraut) most of it is not (cheese spatzle, in particular). But whatever, the beer is legit. And the outside space is great in the summer including the real German tables and benches (the long skinny ones).   Also the service typically is pretty lame, but again, whatever. That's actually fairly accurate to Germany as well XD  Anyway, that is all. I probably have a dozen pictures of a Hefeweizen Halbe (the tall skinny glasses) in my photo album over the years because I pretty much text a photo of it to my family every time is go there for one in the summer but you all know what that looks like and if not there's plenty on Yelp already!  So cheers!",

    "text": "Decor is 10/10 and so is the beer but the food is garbage. I thought they were going to sell legit Bavarian food because some of it is imported. They managed to even Americanize the pretzel. The giant pretzel was nothing like a Bavarian pretzel- it was a glorified philly pretzel. I am not a pretzel elitist but they don't got the food down. A Bavarian pretzel is dark brown, borderline black, matte, and a lot denser. This was soft and fluffy and the cheese sauce was pretty much a less tangy cheese whiz.   The warm potato salad was garbage - slices were undercooked and seasoned all wrong. The use of food service thin sliced American bacon in the fried cabbage did the dish no favors because it comes off as pre-rendered so the fat didn't lend itself to the dish, instead you had these sad, floppy slices of bacon to suggest the miserable life the pig had. I know you have to adapt to the resources around you but it detracted from the dish. Cabbage was completely unremarkable.   The ultimate abomination was the schnitzel itself. The texture was spongy. It was disconcerting to why a cutlet had that texture. And it was not remotely crunchy for something deep fried which made it even worse. This my friend, is not a schnitzel. The wine mushroom sauce for the jaegerschnitzel was not rich and meaty like a real German gravy but was thin and flavorless like something out of a package.   This food was essentially mediocre theme park (a la Dixieland) \"German\" food and I'm confused why was it so mediocre when German food is probably the safest \"ethnic\" food and arguably has the most influence on American food overall (hot dogs, burgers).   For the love of Gott, HB Pittsburgh, make authentic and GOOD Bavarian food for the prices you charge or lower them if you're going to cut corners.   Silver lining is that the beer is solid and served at the right temperature. You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this pint and one you got in a Biergarten in Munich.",

    "text": "A little bit of context: This happened late April. I understand this review is relatively late, but my girlfriend and I were just recapping this unfortunate incident and felt that it would better to speak about it late rather than never.  A little more context: I had visited Hofbrauhaus multiple times and was almost a regular there every Thursday. I had enjoyed their service and food almost every time previously.  So 3 Indian guys, one Hispanic guy and one Caucasian girl walk into a bar. We're asked for IDs. Now for those who are unaware, non-US citizens working full time jobs in the states have a US government issued ID called an Employment Authorization Document(EAD) card. This is an accepted form of identification and I have used it to fly and to apply for credit cards, etc. The manager was adamant that we needed a US state ID/Driver's license or a passport to enter the premises. We told him that we don't have American Driver's licenses, but we were able to each present three alternative forms of identification (EAD cards, international driver's licenses & an expired PA state ID) but this really didn't help our case. We were understanding that every organization has it's rules and we were actually impressed that the organization decided to stay True to it's principles. Also, we're all 26 year olds (so we've been 21 for a while, but again, that really shouldn't make a difference). This is when things got a little sketchy. A group of all Caucasian students entered behind us. Now, I agree, some people look a lot younger than they actually are, but it sometimes is easy to identify when a person is more likely to be 18 and not 21. I still will admit that everyone in the group could have been 21 and this is just me being cynical after being turned away from a bar. However, the same manager who refused us entry, barely glanced at their IDs. I'm no expert but it would be stupid to let a group that looks so young to be let in without a slightly more careful examination. This was more ironic as the manager had previously lectured us about the integrity of the institution. And finally when we were leaving, he asked my Caucasian girlfriend where she was from? This is just a rant but I think it's a little inappropriate to where my obviously white girlfriend is from and again, I'm no expert but his tone indicated some curiosity that as to why a white girl was spending time with a group that consisted of men of color. Either way, it's also a little ridiculous to make conversation with the only female of a group whom you've just kicked out. You asked us to leave and we were. Don't start asking questions that are none of your business.",

Now that I'm an adult and of legal drinking age, visiting Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh I'm allowed to have a liter of beer,  or as I call it \"beer as big as your face,  without the lecture.   With an accordion player dressed in lederhosen and women with corsets pushing up their assets, you feel like you've been transported on a European vacation.  German comfort food is on the menu with a little American flair. It's a destination spot - obviously I bring my Dad every time he visits Pittsburgh to make up for all of those stolen beers over the years.  Typically the only food I order are Bavarian pretzels and bier cheese.  The food isn't the best, but the beer makes me nostalgic.    If you're looking to get the full experience,  stop by on the first Wednesday of the month - its keg tapping day!  New beer is unveiled,  a parade of men and women playing instruments and waving flags while bringing out the first new keg of the month.  If you arrive early enough (say 6pm) you can get a table and stand in line for a free first taste of the beer.  That tower of mugs will be filled with a frothy brew and I'll have a big smile on my face.  If you're looking for something off the beaten path and feel a bit parched,  fill your mug up with some bier at Hofbrauhaus.  PROST!",

Inside is the old German arrangement of the large wooden tables and benches, very heavy, hard to move and seat about 4-6 on each side.  It is also a loud place due to acoustics I think......Also with the table/bench arrangement, If someone wants to get up and in the middle of the bench 2 or 3 people will have to move.  We ordered the German Sausage plates and they were pretty good.  There were 3 kinds on the plate. Smaller than other restaurants but still were very good.  Of course lots of German draft beers and the large ones are HUGE and excellent.... Service was just OK.. not friendly but we weren't ignored.  The recommendation I have though, is before  you sit down, walk around and check out the areas to sit.  If it is nice outside (you know those 3 sunny days in Pittsburgh :-) walk around the back and you see beautiful views of the river and lots of outdoor seating; Covered and uncovered.  There is a huge seating area in a lower level also with benches and tables that I am sure is crowded on weekends with good weather and Oktoberfest.  There was 6 of us and we were disappointed we did not see the outside area before we sat down because that is where we would have been,  It gets a solid 4 and if there during warm weather would go and sit outside.",

Come visit Hofbrauhaus whenever and you will guarantee a good time!  Great beers, love my Hefeweizen and our Wurst platter - Bratwurst, Wiesswurst and Frankfurter ($13.99) was surprisingly good!

    "text": "I have been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich several times and always enjoyed myself there. When I saw that Pittsburgh had a Hofbrauhaus, I had to give it a try.   I thought the decor and ambience was a fairly close replica of the original, though the Munich Hofbrauhaus has a full band, not just an accordion player, and is much more crowded and lively.   They serve beer by the liter or half liter just as in Germany, and the quality of the beer seemed to be the same as what you find in Germany. Many of the same menu items you see in Germany are in the menu, but there are also some American additions, or at least menu items I don't remember seeing on the menu in Munich when I was there. I had one of these, the chicken bourbon sandwich, which I really enjoyed. It had a sweet bourbon sauce and was tender and tasty.   I think they did a real good job at creating a restaurant that gives you as closely as possible a similar experience to what you would get in Germany.",

I've had some of the food, but I will leave it to others to review the cuisine.  And as far as the different beers go, I think they have something for all tastes.  What I want to get across with my review is the atmosphere here.  I have been there later in the evening when all are just drinking there liter beers and singing along to various tunes including some German ones.  You instantly feel transported to Oktoberfest.  It is something that is hard to replicate but they get it done.  On my last trip here I actually got to sit outside in the Biergarten area.  Incredible.  It was a gorgeous day, so that played a huge part and the river behind you just adds to the Euro feeling.  However, they have a large bar out there, plenty of tables with umbrellas and waitresses.  Oh and the restrooms are close by.  You will not be disappointed coming to the Hofbrauhaus.  I just wish I could stop by more.",

Over winter, we ate here a few times, and if you love the bier cheese, check out the broccoli and cheese! Yum! They're very easy going with sides substitution. I ordered a schnitzel dish that came with cabbage - which my body doesn't like- and our lovely server helped pick a substitute with a smile!! Bier: yum, I usually stick to the whitest clearest stuff. They serve only their own, the dude has tried nearly all varieties and has yet to leave one to waste!  Ambience, surely everyone's written about: the main hall can be very loud/ downright rambunctious! Live music with chanting and cheers! The more quiet dining room is less decorative, but if you're looking for more traditional family dinner with conversation, opt for this room.

We went too late for the kitchen to be opened (and missed out on the free birthday item), and so I didn't look too hard for vegan items on the menu, but it looked heavy on sausages, so perhps not too promising.   I choose a dark German beer - Dunkel - but it proved to be pretty bad, and left a nasty aftertaste (dish water, anyone?) - not at all what I expected from a German, and for this reason I can only give it 3 stars.  The birthday girl had a Manhattan, and that was much cheaper than you might pay elsewhere, so that was a surprise.    Would I go back?  Probably, but I'd be trying a different beer for sure, perhaps the monthly special.  But avoid the dark one.",

Anywho I had two beers and could of had a few (the baby size not the liter ). We had the cheese fries to start and not many places have cheese sauce at the bottom (why? I have no clue). So there was an endless supply of cheese. Apparently you can upgrade to put chili on top to make them like nachos. I was going for more of a marathon not a sprint so I opted out. Anyway, I ordered the hot brown with a fried egg on it. Apparently that's the way to do it, and I would agree that it is. It's a potato pancake with ham, turkey, bacon and egg with cheese on cheese on cheeses. It made me feel like . We had the pretzels with cheese too, so as you can imagine, I felt like I would die later. Thankfully I didn't so I could come back today!",

    "text": "I know that this place is not \"authentic,\" but I really don't care. As a Florida native, I grew up with chain restaurants and an occasional local Mexican place. German food was not just scarce, but nearly impossible to find in The Sunshine State.  I had been to two other German restaurants in Georgia and North Carolina before trying Hofbrauhaus right after we moved to Pittsburgh a couple years ago. The restaurants were in cliche \"German\" house-style locations and featured mediocre food only enjoyed by True German food lovers. At the Atlanta location, I turned up my nose to most of the food and remember nibbling on a cold pretzel for most of the evening.  Hofbrauhaus could not be any more different! It has four wonderfully unique sections of the restaurant - formal dining, bier hall, patio, and bier garden. I enjoy the bier hall earlier in the evening before it transforms into a bar, and the patio for late nights and spring/fall weather. Plus, it's covered, so we've even dined out there when it was raining.  The beer is great. My personal favorite is the Hefe Weizen - a delicious wheat beer with a light banana flavor. I also enjoy the Dunkel, their dark lager that hits the spot when the weather is cooler. Each month, they have a different monthly beer, and I look forward to Oktoberfest all year. Make sure to order it early in the month of September in case they run out!  I highly recommend The Works Sampler - pretzels, fried pickles, potato pancakes, and sauerkraut balls, all served with a complementary dip. It's a great appetizer to share with a group of four. Most of the entrees are between $10-15, which I think is very fair for the location and quantity of food. If ordering an appetizer, I would split an entree or sandwich with someone. My husband and I often split the Reuben or Schnitzel Sandwich, which are only $10 and plenty big enough for the two of us. Finally, though you probably won't have room, the Apfel Streudel is fantastic and definitely worth stretching your stomach just a little bit more for.  I would question myself if I was truly in the minority regarding my opinion of this restaurant... but all of our Southern friends and family adore this place. Everyone who comes back for a second visit has requested - even almost begged - to come back here. Several friends and family members have even returned to Florida in search of a similar German place and have been unsuccessful. Maybe it's because we don't have \"refined\" German palates, but I don't care... This restaurant has made several of us (including myself) who thought we hated German food now become a huge fan. And any restaurant that changes my mind about an entire genre is a gem in my opinion.",

Live German music and you can stand on the tables to sing a little Sweet Caroline. And an outdoor biergarten. Definitely a great time and perfect for my large group of drunk, rowdy friends.   The location makes it difficult to reach if you're bar hopping the rest of Southside (without driving and parking in one of the Works' garages). And it was way more fun here when shot skis, a legit Oktoberfest and less intense bouncers were a thing. 2010 Hofbrau would have gotten 5 stars.",

The buffet is a great place to try German food in addition to the add-on starters (pancake was better than the pretzel) and dessert items (puff pastry was better than the streudel). Place was quite and the few who were there looked they were on a lunch break. The buffet table and utensils are outdated but very clean. Staff are usually friendly. Want too happy about paying for parking (street/deck) when most other restaurants validate parking for upto 2 hours). The soups on the buffet are a bit salty but AWESOME!",

It gets packed with a younger crowd at night, the music is pretty loud and they recycle the same 6 songs that college kids love to sing out loud when theyve been drinking. Also you always leave smelling like the food! The outdoor beer garden is great during warm months though because you can sit outside along the river and hear the people you are with. Good experience once in awhile but just be careful as to the time of day you go!",

Warm, soft pretzels are my #1 favorite snack and these were excellent. I would absolutely come again just to have MOAR PRETZELS!  For lunch I had some wurst with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. All was good.  I tried a flight of all their beers, and they were all fine. Nothing incredibly memorable. Five different things gave me plenty to drink over the course of our meal. Seems like a great place to have fun with friends. I recommend this for a visit.

I saw the other location in Las Vegas, so on my recent trip to Pittsburgh, I made an attempt to visit this location. I was really hoping that the place would be more lively and a fun place to get a beer/ start off the trip, but unfortunately this was not the case. Maybe the place had a quitter atmosphere because it was 8pm on a Thursday?   I also thought the menu was very over-priced, which is to be expected at a gimmicky place like this. However, for a place that claims to be a German beer house, I was confused that the beer selection consisted of 5 choices, none of which were pumpkin flavored.    I'm still giving a 3 star review because the food and beer were good and my friends and I enjoyed ourselves, but had to say that I was a little disappointed. I'm open to trying the Vegas location the next time I visit though.",

    "text": "Look, you don't have to be a historian to understand the evils that Germany has been responsible for (and therefore I don't need to explain here). But there is an evil that has somehow eluded the iron shackles of shame....the evils of German food.  It is easily in the bottom 3 of ethnic cuisines.  So I guess that makes my review a bit biased.  But let me regale you with some truth, dear reader; WHOM AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS IS A GERMAN FOOD FAN?!!?! What's that I hear?  Crickets?  That's what I thought.  And I am not counting anyone who has friends named Hans or Helmut or Kurt etc...Beer cheese? Let the Italians and French handle cheese, let the Germans handle beer and roads without speed limits.  (Kraftwerk is my favorite German export, check them out sometime).  Potato pancakes are bland and unappealing.  The thing with pancakes is this....they're not good for you, even these starchy messes.  So if you're going to indulge, go whole hog and go to a breakfast place that specializes in them. (Don't you love how pancakes have escaped the wrath of dietitians and the public? It is a desert that has hitched its ride to breakfast.  What a scam, no wonder most of us get sweaty and out of breath just reading yelp reviews). German sausages!?!?! GO TO CURE AND GET GOOD PORK PRODUCTS.  THE GERMANS CAN'T DO PORK EITHER!!!    I guess Hofbrahaus was fighting with one hand behind their back in the first place.  Anyways...this is a fair to middling drinking place.  If you have out of town friends who come from a relatively rural or small town..they might enjoy the gimmick.     The beer garden itself is a pretty nice spot to enjoy beers on the weekend as well...so I have to acknowledge that.  But it is quite Bro heavy...so if that's not your scene, I get it.    IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Frankie Yankovic.  Polka is pretty bad by most measures, but old people and drunks  love it.  But they can't defend their love of it.",

Of the items on the sampler appetizer platter, I only really liked the potato pancake and the pretzel with the bier cheese dipping sauce! Be warned, all the appetizers are pretty much deep fried so it was too much friedness for me lol. The sampler came with - 2 pretezels, 2 potato pancakes, 4 deep fried pickle spears, and 4 deep fried sauerkraut balls. It's definitely good to share with 3 or more people.  I enjoyed the sausage sampler entree plate. All the sausages were delish and came with plenty of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. Yum!  Great place to get your eat and drink on!",

There is the big hall, with long tables and communal benches where I have seen people dancing on the tables and singing along with the musician. There is also a more traditional dining room area. Then, there is an outdoor beer garden, which is pretty great when the weather is nice- umbrellas, a river view, and tables for both smaller and bigger groups, so it's a great place to bring a crowd. No worries about having 'everyone in your party present in order to be seated.' They are totally cool with people coming and going. The service is good. Even out in the beer garden, servers come by to check on you frequently, which is good if people keep coming and going from your big group....or if people decide they are hungry at different times.   Now, the beer....I'm more of a cocktail girl, but everyone here seems to enjoy the beer choices...and the sizes. They offer beers in the liter and half-liter size. There is something enjoyable about hefting a weighty 1L glass....this beer is no joke, though. Once, while passing through the indoor hall, someone vomited right in front of me. So, watch out for those liter beers. They pack a punch, and not everyone handles it well. One final note - the outfits the waitresses wear make me feel like a bad feminist for patronizing this place, but I do it anyway.",

I've been to the original one in Munich, and its American incarnation was pretty much along the same lines--beer, table-dancing (well, bench-dancing) to cheesy songs that everyone knows the words to, and lots of fun.  As far as beer goes, I wasn't big on their Weizen (wheat beer) and I'm not a fan of lagers in general. Love their Dunkel though, so I always order that. Most of my friends always get the light beer...no comment. Food here isn't very good. Zucchini planks are the only thing I like (huge portion, good for snacking with a group). All the meat dishes are extremely dry and heavy on the salt. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner/drinking combo. Eat elsewhere, then come here to drink.  Another negative, the place gets way too crowded. If you come before 10pm, there will be an obscene wait for a table (and it's not fun if you don't get a table). Sometimes table reservations will be booked for the night as early as 7pm. Come late, and you can usually find some friendly strangers to jump in with. It's a little bit of a hassle to come here on a regular basis, but for birthdays or other special occassions, it's a great spot.",

I would recommend this to anyone on the mood for good food and good beer!",

    "text": "Heavy rain did not deter people from celebrating Oktoberfest at Hofbrau in October 2009 as we ended up waiting on the line for a quoted time of 45 minutes before we can get seated in the beer hall at 6pm on a Saturday night. We were hungry and we were thirsty so we tried to make our way to the bar while we waited. Although the bar was fairly large, It was so packed we had to try and cut our way through 3 rows of people before we could even make it to the counter. We decided against it and pestered the hostess again if there was any available seating anywhere. It was also just another excuse to talk to the beautiful ladies welcoming people at the door.  They were immediately able to accommodate us at the separately enclosed quiet room and we took it. That service receives a check mark in my book for now.  There was of course a good selection of beer on the menu priced decently for light and dark beer connoisseurs alike. As for the food, I could've done better with my $14 then get the Weiner schnitzel here which ended up just being a fried pork cutlet with some sides. It tasted just like any standard fried pork cutlet and could be gotten for just $6 at Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill. I even ordered it with an egg on top (extra $1 charge with meal) and they forgot to put it on. So they decided to charge me $3 for one cooked egg to put on top of my pork cutlet by myself. (I rectified the situation when the bill came) Although the food was pretty standard and nothing to write home about or in this case, to yelp, one nice thing I liked about my meal was the German potato salad side. Of all the sides my friends and I ordered, we believed that that was the best side.  I'm sure the meal would've tasted a lot better if I had a couple more beers in me and we were swigging away in the beer hall but since we ate this sober, I was able to give my taste buds a full chance to try out Hofbrau's quality and a 3 out of 5 star rating of its food.   If I were to come back next time, we would probably just be in the bier hall for its beer at night. We weren't able to experience it, but it looked like everyone was having fun in there.",

    "text": "Somehow today was my first time at this Hofbrauhaus. I've been to the Munich and Sydney locations and they have done a good job in Steel Town.  Can't believe how busy it was on a Saturday at 3:00.  There are multiple locations to pull up a chair. There is a smaller room with maybe 20 tables closest to the street, which is the quietest place. The main hall easily has 50 tables and there is an outside deck with maybe another 30 tables. It appears there is another level below the deck but I'm not sure what that is used for.   Service was alright, generally fast but it seems some employees chose clothing maybe a size or two too small. Selection of beer is somewhat disappointing. Four standards and one seasonal that rotates monthly. Really? I've been to much smaller places that can put out better selection than this...   Food was alright, standard fare of Spaetzle, Pretzels, Schnitzel and Burgers. Appetizers are ridiculously priced at $10, but entrees range from $10-20 and seem more reasonable. Sandwiches and burgers are $7-9 and probably the best deal.   My favorite part was observing the German touches. If you have lived in Germany for any time, you will notice things like the picnic tables and silverware/napkins in a stein on the table that are distinctively German.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place since I love German food and drink. Okay, they serve beer by the liter, that is awesome! They have a full German menu, also awesome! The reason for three stars is that the service was pretty much \"meh.\" I think our waitress quit judging by the reaction of our second waitress. The food was alright, nothing amazing, but acceptable nonetheless. I am not sure if it was an off night or if I built it up in my mind to be something it wasn't. Either way, it was an experience, but once was enough.",

We celebrated a friend's birthday here, and the entire thing was actually new to my experience: the dance hall, the three-tiered outside seating area, the hoochies, the brosephs, the smoking, the fighting, how we got stared at for being gay. Won't be back. I actually have adopted use of 'Hofbrauhaus' as an adjective to mean 'way out of control and unpleasant' -- as in, \"Oh, the law school halloween party was completely Hofbrauhaus.\"",
