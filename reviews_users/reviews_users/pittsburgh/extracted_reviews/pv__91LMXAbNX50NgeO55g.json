The strawberry cake has a light, fluffy whipped cream that compliments the fruit and prevents the cake from feeling too heavy. The red bean pastries are tasty, hearty, and would serve as a filling snack. The store, like the employees and packaging, was neat. The woman who helped me was very kind and courteous. She took notice that I was waiting outside in the snow and came out to ask me to wait in the warmth of her store.",

Wasn't a fan of the buttercream pastries, although the bread itself was very good. HOWEVER, the chocolate bun WAS TO DIE FOR. TO DIE FOR. If you've ever had super soft Mexican bread, I.e. conchitas or conchas, THE CHOCOLATE BUN HERE IS THE TAIWANESE VERSION but probably 100 x's better because in assuming they always make them fresh here and are always super soft and ohhhh soooo good. Plus, in Pittsburgh you won't find any Mexican bread so just fill those cravings HERE. :) love, love, love it. Don't sell these out ill have your head. I couldn't wait to take a pic so sorry bout the almost devoured chocolate bun. They have other flavors too like strawberry, green tea, mocha, yeah.",

One day, my husband and I went by and they were open. We went in for Korean ice cream with shave ice. It is very good. We love it. It is a lot more expensive than what we paid in Phoenix but it is very good. I also bought a few bread/bakery that day. They are very good. They were playing my husband's favorite music when we were there that day. I am going to try their sweet potato cake.   I actually heard about this place from a cab driver about 7 months ago but I didn't know this is the place. He told me that there is a great Korean bakery very closed to me when he drop me off from the airport. I am glad that I have a chance to try it.   I told my coworker about this place. She was very excited and called them about a birthday cake. She told me it's a $75 a cake for the size to feed her family. :-)   It is not cheap but it should be a must try when you are in the town.",

Only one request: PLEASE start using the Square or another payment system like a lot of other local businesses that don't take credit cards otherwise (East End Brewery, Commonplace Coffee, etc.) - the cakes are $$$ and it is a pain to pay that much in cash these days, and there are so many new options for small businesses.

If you've never had bingsu before (I hadn't), it's shaved ice with condensed milk, topped with ice cream, mochi, and red bean in this instance. I paid 8 dollars for it and, upon seeing it, understood why. It could easily be split among 3 people. I'll be back next time I'm craving red beans or a cold treat.

    "text": "Having a Korean bakery across from a Chinese one can be a nice thing, since here they make some things not found across the street, like the shaved ice. I've tried some of their cakes, and these have not failed me. The green tea cheesecake is sweet with a good soft consistency and a strong green tea taste. The rosewater cake is probably one of their more unique ones, and it comes with a strong but sweet floral flavor.  On the other hand, I've tried one of their green tea pastries, and that was a bit less memorable. For buns, I do think the ones at Pink Box look a bit more appealing.  I do wish they have longer hours since they do desserts in the form of shaved ice and bubble teas!",

Their breads are so soft and fluffy and my roommate and I loved everything we bought. I'm a sucker for simple Red Bean buns and they are delicious and have ample amounts of filling. The breads are also very balanced, not overly sweet but hits that accent of comforting. We bought quite a selection and they were still great the next day! -Chocolate Bun- Not overly sweet despite it's apperance. Baked chocolate bread and inside is just lovingly soft. -Condensed Milk Bread- Interesting flavor! Super soft and great with jam! -Mocha bread- Perfect companion with any hot drink!  We also ate one of their Mango Bingsoo's! Super refreshing on a hot day and can feed up to 3 people! The Bakery itself was clean and comfortable and at a good temperature and the Customer service was excellent. I highly highly recommend this bakery as a dessert spot after having dinner in the neighborhood. Since there's very little competition in pittsburgh it's still Fantastic quality! I'm dreaming about what the cakes must taste like.",

Little did she know we'd be freezing our butts off at 11 in the morning eating Red Bean (Pat/Pot) Bingsu, and buying Red Bean buns. (Our first trip to find Sumi's was a disappointment because I wasn't sure where on Murray Ave., they were, and when we found Sumi's, it was closed). Being in town this weekend, we made our way to Sumi's with success!  We grabbed our spoons, and worked our way into the pile of sweet red beans, two scoops of red bean ice cream, pineapple, chewy rice cake pieces, and shaved ice covered in sweetened condensed milk. The goose bumps, and shivers were so worth it.   The red bean buns weren't too sweet, with the perfect ratio of sweet red beans and chewy bread like bun. Definitely yummy.  The space was clean, and modern, the cake case filled with perfect round frosted  cakes. The cashier was friendly, and patient, and we got to chat with the owner, when she came to ask if we liked the Bingsu!! So much better than boring doughnuts, we're already looking forward to more goose bumps, and something new to try next time.   *cash only, and you can get vanilla ice cream in your Bingsu instead of the Red Bean ice cream, just try it!",

    "text": "This place has always been on my radar but since I'm not a huge sweets person I never rushed to try. Had a friend mention that Sunmi's had patbingsu and needless to say I was all over that.   ATMOSPHERE;; Atmosphere is great. Very quaint and quiet with two window tables and a larger table in the back. The breads are arranged in the left wall and the counter situated to the right with a small cake display in front of their menus. I went in on a Sunday afternoon so it was quiet except for the owners or managers? When I walked in the door I was greeted by a gleaming baby and I'm a sucker for babies. He was so adorable. I love the family bakery feel it makes the place way more cozy and inviting.  FOOD HIGHLIGHTS;; GREENTEA CAKE --- I've never tried any of their breads, but I have had their matcha cake and it is amazing. The flavored are so good, not too sweet and the green tea flavoring is not overpowering. The cake is also a kind of cream based, and it's...I dare to say...perfect. I'm dying to try their other cakes as well as their breads. Reading the other reviews it doesn't seem like I'll be disappointed at all.   PATBINGSU --- I will say I was disappointed that my shaved ice came out to $14...but I understand why. The fruit shaved ice is typically served with what I'm guessing is vanilla ice cream perhaps? But me trying to be a major FA and be all fancy, decided that I wanted the red bean and fruit combined...thus $14. The size was really good with 2 scoops of ice cream a nice serving of the pat, fresh...yes fresh...strawberries, kiwis, mangos, mochi and more! Not sure of it was worth $14, but I didn't leave complaining at all. If I will say one thing it is that I wish the red bean ice cream was slightly softened a bit. I waited a few minutes before I dug in so that the ice cream would be easier to eat. The fruits were a bit on the sour side as well, but let's face it it is not primo fruit season just quite yet. All in all I'm happy I found a place with Korean shaved ice. I will not be fancy next time and ask them to combine two different types. Let's not fix something that ain't broke.   OVERALL;; A promising little bakery nestled on a busy and bustling street. Their selection of breads seemed a bit more expansive than other local Asian bakeries. They keep it very simple and they seem to do what they do very well. I recommend this little bakery. I will be back to try more and give an updated review.",

My partner didn't think the cake was sweet enough but he likes that sugary dense frosting you get at the grocery store so...

    "text": "I've been meaning to check out Sumi's for a long while, and I finally stopped by on Sun.  As a counterpoint to the Chinese bakery across the street, Sumi's specializes in Korean baked goods, which are more subtly sweet than their American counterparts.  The format is similar in that the goods are set out, and you make your selections and bring them up to the register for purchase.  During my visit, I selected a matcha bun ($2) and a red bean cake ($2).  I ate the matcha bun immediately, given that it wasn't packaged and the red bean cake was.  As a fan of matcha flavored sweets, I was pleased with the balance between the slight bitterness and sweetness of the matcha coating.  The bun itself was brioche, and was quite fluffy yet substantial.  I tried the red bean cake later and was less pleased with it.  Having visited East Asia a few times, I'm quite familiar with red bean desserts.  My issue here was that I found the amount of red bean paste overwhelming, making the dessert sweeter than I expected for an Asian dessert.  Also, the textures of the cake and the filling were both very similar, and I would have preferred more differentiation (e.g., crispy exterior with soft interior).  Service was friendly, and the interior is much more spacious than it appears from outside, with chairs and tables for those wishing to enjoy their sweets on site.  Like the Chinese bakery across the street, I found the price point to be a bit high, but not totally unreasonable.  I'd return, but I'd get something different than the red bean cake next time.  3.5 stars.",

Sumi's offers your traditional Korean buns filled with red bean, but for those accustomed to places like Tour Les Jours or PB, you'll notice that Sumi's bread is a lot more sophisticated and she packs the red bean like no other. Sumi's does similar iterations for other items with the similar bread base with green tea and their cream/mocha cream buns. The selection is not as large as your typical Korean bakeries, but what they do, they do well.  The atmosphere is nice- few tables, high ceiling, and never any crazy bustling.

I personally love the butter cream, mocha cream and crumbs buns. The fillings aren't too sweet--exactly how I like it.   I also ordered a small whipped cream strawberry cake from here and it was perfect. I'm usually really reluctant to try cakes because most of the time they tend to be too sweet and sugary. However, the cake from Sumi's is so creamy with the right amount of sweetness--just enough to leave you wanting more.   I highly recommend Sumi's Cakery for your sweets cravings. If you do decide to buy a cake though, make sure you let her know a few days in advance so she'll reserve one for you. The ones on display are sold fast.",

    "text": "If Sumi's patbingsu is what all patbingsu tastes like, I don't know why regular shave ice (or even filipino halo-halo) still exists. I'm normally not a huge fan of red bean desserts--if you've never had red bean, consider trying it in bread before trying a whole red bean bingsu--but this was amazing. And you can easily share this with 3-4 people. I'll be going back to try the other flavors for sure.  Tip from Sumi: Bingsu is meant to be mixed up completely so that you don't end up with plain shave ice at the bottom.  The bubble tea is nothing special. They use powdered flavoring (as most places do) and the boba is a bit on the hard/chewy side. You can also tell they don't soak their boba in sweet syrup which can be good or bad depending on your preference--it's not that noticeable unless you're really into bubble tea. Now if they made bubble tea smoothies out of the red bean or matcha ice cream they use in the bingsu, that would be good..",

The prices are a little high, but they do have a monopoly being the only Korean bakery in Pittsburgh (that I know of). The green tea mousse cake is pretty good - light and not too sweet. Bubble tea is alright and the Korean shaved ice is massive - a great treat to share with friends on a hot and humid summer day. I definitely prefer Sumi's over the other bakeries in Squirrel Hill. The base bread is always moist and the red bean is just right.",

I always come about thrice a semester to share some shaved ice over good conversation with my girlfriends. The lighting is a little dim, which sets the perfect atmosphere for a little catching up with old friends and the owner is super friendly and sweet as well. 10/10 would recommend their cakes and shaved ice desserts!",

I didn't think much of the mocha cream bun at first: the flat, nondescript bun wasn't very eye-catching and didn't seem to have much cream in the middle. However, I was proven wrong. It was So. Freaking. Good.  The bread is so soft and fluffy and the cream is smooth, silky, and has just the right amount of sweetness. There's not a lot of cream, but it still packs plenty of flavor and the overall bun is not too sweet. I finished the entire thing in about two minutes--it was that good.  I'm leaving this review at 4 stars until I can return and try some of their other offerings! Will definitely be back (to buy all of the mocha cream buns, that is).  Meanwhile, it's going to take all my willpower not to immediately shove the other bun I bought into my mouth right now.",

Upon first bite, the 10,000 Maniacs song, City of Angels (about going to Los Angeles & being shocked at the contrast between the have's grotesque glamour, waste, & consumption & the squalid living conditions of the homeless have-not's) went through my head: Heaven, is this Heaven? O Heaven, is this Heaven...Where we are?  It was in a word: Heavenly, & I'm not a guy that throws that word around lightly.  Moist cake, light frosting...the only thing keeping it from floating away was the generously given, thickly cut, fresh-as-can-be strawberry halves inside the cake.  The cake was full of grace & I could imagine Sumi quietly making it fresh this morning. I could taste the whole thought process, the Genesis / fruition of it from start to finish. I may have tripped out, but it was totally Biblical, maaaaannnnn!  Each bite was a revelation & I was full (& thankful) w/ one quarter slice. It lasted the whole weekend, way longer than I expected it to, & it was a nice treat that taught me a lesson...  Simplicity, elegance, silence, grace & beauty are the easiest things to achieve, yet we choose the opposite so many times to our detriment. We want things but believe that we have to go about getting it in the hardest, loudest, crudest ways possible (U.S. Healthcare, politics, Wall Street, reality TV, etc). If we would just let our objects of desire be, they would come into being.  I am frequently accosted by beggars in Squirrel Hill asking for a dollar or any spare change. I usually shun them but in the future, I may buy them a piece of cake (pun intended) from Sumi's so that they too may experience an early taste of Heaven...  (this is the Eden).",

All they had was few slices of cake (maybe the green tea flavor) and the snack items that don't need any refrigeration. That was disappointing. However, among the few items they had, I had the butter cream puff which is amazing and I got a chance to taste the mocha puff.  I liked both the puffs. They are good for breakfast, snack or dessert.   I will go back again early after they open the shop instead of going at the end of the day.",

    "text": "I'm going to write the honest truth. I don't care if it's libellious. If you don't like it, feel free to Sumi.  What to get: Bubble Tea... the amazing black milk tea and the perfect honeydew. What not to get: Sued I thought you said you didn't mind getting sued: I changed my mind. So Sumi.  Let's start with the mediocre elements of this Korean bakery. I'm not as impressed as others by the cakes, or the expensive Korean ice.  My experience with Sumi was at first a one-star-type-thing. The young girl (not the owner) was so put off that I came in 15 min before closing. She didn't want to make the shaved ice, and was complaining in Korean to another young employee. She made the ice but wouldn't give it to me because she had no box to put it in (what? I can't even). She begrudingly gave my money back. Said yes to makign me bubble tea instead, but then no because she had no tapioca. Wtf.   I shouldn't have gone back, but I did. I'm glad I did.  I got the chance to try the ice on my second visit. It's bizarre, indescribable Korean shaved ice, which will set you back $10 but it's the size of a house so it's worth it... maybe. Except I don't really like it. Can't they make it in a smaller size? It's a lot like Taiwanese shaved ice, or a Halo Halo in some ways (from the Philippines). It's an experience, for sure. Not one that I will repeat on a regular basis, but it's well worth a try just to say that you had it. I can't really describe what's in it, it's a little of everything from fruit and ice to syrup and jelly to sweetcorn and bean paste. Bizarre.  While the dessert is just ok, the Bubble Tea is so good I went back for a Honeydew which was also excellent. The Black Milk tea is phenomenal. Tastes like heaven. Very good job. Right up there at the top of Pitt ones. It takes a lot for me to really enjoy a bubble tea, and while Pitt doesn't have the best selection, for me to put this on a level with the excellent teas at I Tea Cafe really shows how highly I regard it. I'm obsessed with bubble teas, and Sumi's has one of the best, if not the best, I've had in Pennslvania. So if you love bubble teas, give these a try.  And if they sold footwear, they'd be Shoe-me Bakery. If they were a cow-milking farm, they'd be Moo-me Bakery. If they were a public restroom, they'd be Loo-me Bakery (or Poo-me I suppose. Ew). If they were a plastic surgery centre, they'd be New-me Bakery. And if they were a singles/hook-up bar, they'd be Do-me Bakery. And I'd visit even more often.",

I'm not in Squirrel Hill often, but when I found myself here I wanted to hit up this bakery after reading all the stellar reviews. I walked in and had no clue what to get. I'd read about the phenomenal cakes, but it was late in the afternoon and they were all gone.  I went across the baskets of what looked like bread products and asked the employee what to get. I picked the blueberry and pumpkin buns and a cream filled pastry. All the pastries reminded me of a cross between cake and a very sweet bread, if that makes sense. But the cream itself in the one pastry wasn't overly sweet, which was unexpected, but I liked it. Both pastries were light, fluffy and incredibly moist.   I would love to get my hands on a cake at some point soon. If you're a sweets lover, this is absolutely worth a try for something completely different!",

    "text": "I work by here and have been wanting to try this place forever. We tried the green tea shaved ice, which was great! My boyfriend wanted to try the green tea flavor and I'm not usually a huge matcha fan, but even though the powder is scattered all over, you can mix it in with the condensed milk and ice, which makes the flavor not as strong. That being said, the fact that I don't really like matcha powder and I still really enjoyed this dessert says a lot, right? They put a lot of condensed milk, which I LOVE, a good amount of azuki bean, green tea ice cream, and a good amount of ice. Service was fast and super friendly, they saw that we were going to sit at a table someone got up from and ran over to quickly wipe the table, which was super nice of them!   The only thing is I think $10 is a lot for the shaved ice dessert, but they give a lot of it, so I would recommend splitting it with a bunch of people.  I'm definitely coming back to try their bubble tea and various desserts!",

After a pleasant hour at the cat cafe downtown, my friends and I stopped here for some desserts.  This place is a bakery and a dessert place, all in one. The baked goods are solid, though I wish there was just a bit more variety. As far as the shaved ice goes, it's actually a really good deal. It costs $10 but you get enough of it to feed 2-3 people. We came as a group of five and shared the mango patbingsoo and the red bean patbingsoo. Both were incredibly tasty, although I liked the mango a bit more. The mango was very sweet, and also came with some mochi and red bean itself. Both patbingsoo also had scoops of ice cream and condensed milk, which helped add to the flavors of the dish. I also had a sip of my friend's matcha bubble tea, which was very tasty and had a strong green tea taste to it.  Solid dessert place, definitely worth visiting if you are into shaved ice and bubble tea.",

Every time I come here they seem to be closed so it was the perfect opportunity to test the store out!  After seeing pictures on Yelp, I knew i needed a fruit tart, and I ordered a blackberry and raspberry fruit tart ($4).  Sumi's makes a whipped cream based fruit tart, which is typically not my favorite type.  However, the whipped cream was light and amazing, probably the best I have ever eaten.  The berries were delicious as well.  The price, though, is even higher than Pink Box across the street.  I have never been to a Korean bakery so I decided to also test out a mocha bun ($1.50).  It tastes almost like a dinner roll filled with mocha flavored whipped cream.  It was different but delicious.  The bread was good, and the filling was very strongly mocha flavored.  I am really looking forward to testing out other kinds of Korean desserts.  I don't know if this was a holiday thing, but the selection was very very small.  There were only two kinds of fruit tarts when I went it, which was fine but smaller than I thought.  Just fyi!",
