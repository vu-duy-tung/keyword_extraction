The pepperoni was very spicy, the Pizza wasn't cooked enough and it looked like the dough was old. That was the last time we ordered from Italian Village. Someone recommend  me \"La casa del sole\" in Aspinwall. We now order from \"La Casa del sole\", it is less expensive and very very good.",

My wife and I often take a 15 minute ride when we don't want to cook dinner.  We have plenty of pizza places near us, but as good as this.",

They have a great selection of Dog Fish Head Beers and you can buy a 6 pack to take one. On top of their great selection we we're also really surprised with the prices. All the beers are very reasonable for being such high quality and they also have an awesome happy hour on Fridays which we look forward to taking advantage of in the future.

I also had the chicken \"Wedgie\", it was great. You get a lot of food for the price. Restaurant was pretty clean for the most part. Definitely will be coming back.",

    "text": "One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.  Was charged .50 up front because I asked for ranch, but give it out for free if you ask after paying.  I brought it up to the cashier that they were deceiving customers and said it was her job to not disclose that to customers.  I asked for a refund and the manager was a huge jerk about refunding it and tried to argue with me that it costs money to buy the ranch. I obviously understand it's an expense, but they should charge everyone.  Manager told me to \"take a hike\" and threw my refund on the counter.  Shocked that a place with this terrible of customer service is still in business.",

    "text": "Stopped into Italian Village Pizza today to give them a retry. It has been sometime since I have eaten their food and wanted to see if they raised their standards since my last encounter (moons ago).  Walking in, the joint appears to be clean (even behind the counter). The staff were friendly even though they were all very busy getting ready for the day.  I ordered a medium sausage pie to go, which took around 25 minutes.  The pizza is a standard New York style thin crust. Although they do offer other styles, this is the type I selected. The pizza is good, nothing to write home about, but good. I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch one day around 1:30 on a Tuesday. It wasn't crowded out all and the lady behind the counter was friendly and offered us menus.   Typical pizza place menu: salads, hoagies, calzones, Stromboli, whole pizzas or by the slice, apps (garlic knots, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, etc), and BEER.   Comfortable seating with a selection of booths, tables, and bar like seating right in the front window of the restaurant to people watch everyone walking by on the sidewalk.   I ordered two slices of the tomato and ricotta pizza. My husband got an order of the hot mango habanero wings, and half a steak/mushroom hoagie. He also got the Dogfish 90 minute IPA. The lady behind the counter brought that to our table. Our number was called after about 15 minutes and we got our food.   The pizza was good. Really light and minimal ingredients. Crunchy crust which is different from what I like, but it was tasty. The wings were good. My husband likes them more than I do and he approved of them. Not too hot. Now the hoagie... let me tell you. It had me rethinking my slices of pizza as soon as my man brought it to the table. The bread was perfectly toasted on the outside and had a soft middle. The steak and mushrooms lay on top lettuce and tomato. The cheese was melty and mixed in perfectly with the meat. Of course I made him share with me :)   Overall it was a good experience. My only complaint is that I wasn't for sure what to get, but now I definitely know. That hoagie was great. We will probably go back!",

    "text": "When it comes to pizza I am somewhat spoiled; having lived in New York, Queens, and long Island. I havea tendency to measure all pizza against New York Pizza palors. Italian Village was exactly what I expected from chain Pizza service. The pizza was okay and the atmosphere was Pittsburgh.  I appreciated the quick service and polite servers. the Pasta fagioli was different from what I'm used to but good none-the-less.   I went there and are lunch with a co-worker and we were able to carry on a conversation without having to compete with the televisions all around us.  It was nice to be able to hear a conversation that wasn't drowned out by jukebox music or television chatter.   If I had one complaint it would be the fact that a certain cable news channel was tuned in and the last thing I want when I'm eating is political rhetoric being spewed by hate mongers.  If you are in the area of this Italian Village Pizza and you want a nice,  well priced Italian lunch: them stop by this place and relax.",

    "text": "Don't count on them for delivery.  Restaurant was dirty too, in past visit.  Ordered from Italian Village Pizza at 2:40 pm on their website for delivery at 4:30 pm.  The weather is expected to be poor tonight, and I'm not feeling well, so I figured that I'd get my order in (about $50) to give them time to get it here.  Wow, was I wrong.  My son and I waited in our garage so the driver wouldn't have to negotiate our walk in the rain.  We waited for 20 minutes, so I checked on the status.  It was out for delivery at 5:10 pm per the status on the email link.  At 5:20, I called the store and the woman that answered said it would be there shortly.  At about 5:40 I called and she said that the driver is still out.   At 5:53, I ended up talking to a supervisor who offered me half off and said that the driver was in a neighborhood about 3 miles away.  I live about 1 1/2 miles from the store.  It's now 7:00.  I get that Fridays are busy.  I get that the weather is poor.  I'm a very understanding person.  I have an additional tip ready for the driver.  This is horrible service.  The woman that I talked to on the phone sounded high, and the supervisor just about yelled at me - yeah, I get that it's a stressful job.  Just tell me that you ain't going to deliver to my house, and I'll take my business somewhere else from the beginning.  I tried to put a comment on their website for feedback, but surprise!  The site isn't set up to receive feedback for this store.  Can't find a corporate contact anywhere.  Just hope that I don't get charged for this order.  Oh, and last time that I was in there, seemed like it's really gone down... was sticky, dirty, and the server also seemed high.",

The salads are fresh and good-sized.  Given the price point, it's nearly 4-star food...  But this location is a little be greasy.  The surfaces of the tables, the seating, the floors, all have a bit of a sheen.  I know it's tough when cooking this type of food, but other restaurants seem to make their dining rooms a bit cleaner.  Not a show stopper, but it is a turn-off and seems it would be easy to address.",

I neither crave their pizza or leave disappointed - but you definitely need to eat it fresh out of the oven.  They have a decent garden salad as well by avoid the balsamic dressing as it doesn't have a strong balsamic so it tastes mostly like oil.  I'd be interested to try their gyro or hoagies, but haven't to date. Staff isn't the friendliest bunch.",
