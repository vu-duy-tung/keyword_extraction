PG is only open for breakfast and lunch so I tend to stop by when I'm craving a hearty breakfast. The restaurant is small with only a few tables and booths.  In addition to the regular menu, they have daily specials written on a chalk board. The atmosphere is homey and reminescent of a simpler time when people would sit for hours reading a newspaper and drinking coffee over breakfast withot the distraction of cell phones, t.v.s and ipads. The owner/chef is friendly and frequently comes out to say hello and hold the door for you. The food has always been on the mark. My latest love, the triple berry pancakes. Light, fluffy and full of melt in your mouth warm berries. As always, the dishes are accompanied by a small fruit salad garnish. All in all, a great break from the crowded, fast paced breakfast joints like the Original Pancake House or Pamelas. Go to PG to sit back and enjoy your meal and your company.",

The downside is every time I have gone (3 times so far) the service has been painfully slow, even getting a server to come to the table once can take 20 minutes. This is for lunch, I've not been there for breakfast. But they are very pleasant people and once you get your food it is a good experience.",

The fact that they only had four tables with customers including us, one would think they'd get their food within 15 minutes... Not this place. A regular came in with his two children at least 20 minutes after us and they were greeted so warmly. As we were there a half hour waiting for our food the older waitress brought the regular and his kids their food. Our waitress then comes over a few minutes after I witnessed that and asks \"Oh, did you say you wanted bacon on your sandwich?\" then answered herself \"Yeah, you did.\" before I could say yes and she went back into the kitchen. My mother and I decided we were leaving. I told the waitress \"We've been here 45 minutes and the guy you know over there got his food almost as soon as he walked in. We're leaving.\" She said she understood and the chef manning the kitchen was new. It was weird she said that when we were there a month and a half before and he was working with the owner. So we left and went down the street to Shouf's Cafe. Let me say if you want friendly and fast service go there. They were busy, but we were seated right away and had our food within 15 minutes of ordering. Papa Gallo is a complete disaster.",

Both had the same traits -- eggs WAY over done (what's so hard about an over easy egg?), smothered in cheese and what seemed like ortega salsa.  Unaltered black beans straight from the can.  A couple corn tortillas underneath.  Totally lacking in inspiration and effort.

I must say we were very disappointed with our experience. First when we walked in the door we were greeted very coldly by the receptionist who also happened to be our waitress. Her social skills were sorely lacking and quite frankly shouldn't really work with the public directly because her personality left a lot to desired. So obviously our first impression wasn't a very good one. We each ordered a soup/ sandwich combo which was alright, nothing special and the soup was lukewarm at best. Sad to say we won't be going back to Papa Gallo and certainly wouldn't recommend it.",

I got super greasy eggs and a rubbery pancake and it cost me more than $10!  The portions were pitifully small too. Dad got chorizo and eggs and was underwhelmed as well.  The entire time, the kitchen staff was talking about us and laughing.  Overall a bad expire ce and won't visit again. Overpriced and low quality.  Much better off going to a local Carnegie diner where there is good food, much better service, and portions are better for a much better price.

The yolks were overcooked to the point of being dry.  Kill me.  The sauce was scant, thin and watery.  Two tables that came in after us were done and or had left before our food ever arrived.  Our menus were closed, signaling ready to order, before our coffee came.  No one bothered to ask us how our meals were.  A tremendous disappointment.

The cook's ringing of the dang bell in that place got on my nerves as did the way he talked to his staff. Service was fine - and got a few apologetic glances when the cook yelled again about something stupid.  Like the previous reviewer, I wanted another tortilla - 1 and a half flour tortillas... you'd think it would be easier to use two. My guess is cost cutting. What difference does 1/2 a tortilla make?? Any way, who cares. Won't be back. Oh- and I peered at the cooks supplies and recognized a lot of labels from Aldi's. Interesting!",

To say I was disappointed could be an understatement.  It didn't seem overly busy when I arrived at 8am so I'm not sure why there was such a problem with, well, everything.  My friend and I ordered the same thing: the Triple Berry Pancakes with sides of bacon and home fries.  Seems simple enough.  Or so we thought until we waited nearly an hour for our food.  And then when we finally did get our food, we each only got one pancake while the chef made more (we should have each received 2 with or order).  The bacon strips were all cooked together in one clump.  The potatoes were okay.  The pancakes, when we did finally get them, were really good.  Which is the only reason I gave two stars.  The service was atrocious.  There wasn't even a waitress when I first arrived.  I had only ordered a water to drink and my friend ordered a water and a coffee.  It seemed at times like the waitress was purposely avoiding our table as my friend had to practically get her own refills.  I don't know why our food order took so long, but no apology was ever made during our wait.  On our way out, after the longest breakfast ever and after we had paid our bill, both the chef and the waitress apologized.  But it felt like too little too late.  I would like to go back to try other items on the menu but I'm not sure I will based on this first experience.",

Notice that almost all the negative reviews focus on slow service. This is not the place to go if you are in a hurry, but good food is worth waiting for. The chef cooks the food for each order completely from scratch. You won't see a pile of home fries or bacon on the griddle like you will at a diner. I have experienced nothing but prompt, attentive, and very friendly service from the wait staff. To paraphrase Alan Watts, you cannot save time, you can only spend it, and MacDonald's is a horrible place to spend time; spend it a PapaGallo Cucina instead! Despite one of the reviews I read, there are good vegetarian options on the menu; perhaps they were added after that review, I don't know. I have ordered three different vegetarian breakfast items straight from the menu, including the only decent Huevos Rancheros I have yet found in Pittsburgh. $3.50 for a side may seem excessive, but the menu prices are lower than you will find at Eat -n- Park, and the quality significantly better.",

We were there for almost 2 hours for brunch, and my girlfriends Popeyes's omelet was way over cooked and her toast was burnt on one side. I decided to try the fish tacos, and was disappointed. Something in them was very sour. Did not enjoy them at all. Since we waited for almost 1:30 hours for our food, we didn't complain. We wont be back.",

There are up-charges that are never advised up front.  They offered fresh syrup for pancakes and I said yes to find out it was $3.00 extra per order for a small side of syrup.  I added sausage to our daughters pancake and it was a spicy sausage link, no one advised when ordering it was spicy and it was clearly for our child so we didn't eat it.    Breakfast for a family of 4 was close to $50.00 and it took us an hour to get food.  The food was ok, but not worth an hour wait or the cost.  It was the same the last time we had visited.  They are nice and the food is good, but it's just not worth the wait and price.",

We were seated right away, but it took about a half hour for anyone to even acknowledge us, and we had to tell them we were ready to order. Around 12 a waitress stopped by to tell us she was going to check on our order, but she never did. Fast forward to 12:30, and we were still sitting there without our food so we left. Pretty disappointing, because the food looked & smelled good, but it's not worth going for the terrible service.",

Everyone's portions were small and overpriced. $3 for fries on the side??? They tasted like they ordered them from McDonald's. Would have rather gone to Eat n Park considering the $60 check and the ~40 minute wait for our food. Kitchen Nightmares candidate anyone?",

The waitress came over quickly enough, but stumbled when asked a simple question about one of the items on the menu: How are the eggs prepared? No biggie.  Coffee was great, except that when I asked for a refill, I was told that the pot was empty and they were closing soon. That rubbed me the wrong way. She later took the coffee off my receipt, so... The food took 45 min to arrive. Unacceptable considering there was only one table occupied when I arrived.  Food was good, but did not wow me. I ordered the cannonball omelet. I am fairly certain they used regular breakfast sausage links instead of spicy sausage. The omelet was on the small side and came with one and a half pieces of toast. No potatoes.  $9.50. A bit high in my opinion.  I will not be going back.",

We waited almost 1 hour for our breakfast.  There was the wrong cheese on my friends breakfast sandwich.  I had asked for \"fresh\" egg whites (not the substitute kind) and was told she'd ask... never heard anything more.. breakfast came and I did got egg whites, so I assumed all was good.  UNTIL I received my bill... I was being charge an EXTRA $4 for my egg whites!!!  I went to pay my bill and asked the waitress why she didn't inform me of the extra charge (it is not listed on the menu) and she went to get the cook- who came out very defensive and ARROGANT... I told him I didn't think it was fair for me to pay extra since it was not listed on menu.  He argued with me telling me I would go to JAIL if I did not pay!!!  Are you serious????  I will never return here, and I urge fellow breakfast connoisseurs to go elsewhere for a more reasonable priced breakfast where they actually CARE about their customers!",

    "text": "NOT VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY. Walk in and the smell of bacon greets you.  Really nothing on the menu is suitable for vegetarians.  I ordered the home fries, which were described on the menu as grilled potatoes, and lo and behold they turned out to be potatoes covered in pieces of bacon.   I told the staff I was a vegetarian, the cook politely offered to make me a new batch of potatoes, but everything is cooked on the same grill.   Ergo, the next batch of potatoes were infused with bacon grease and residual bacon bits.     They didn't offer an apology, or like any decent restaurant, comp the bacony potatoes, or apply a discount or coupon for future visit.  Nothing.  We were charged the full bill as if our meal was satisfactory.  Our return business was not important to them.  I also ordered a cinnamon roll and what I received was a cinnamon muffin.   There is a difference.  A cinnamon roll is a soft chewy rolled up magically delicious thing covered in lovely gooey icing that leaves your fingers sticky.  A cinnamon muffin is a dry, crispy, cinnamon flavored MUFFIN.   I thought perhaps they made a mistake so I mentioned that it was a cinnamon roll I had ordered and they said \"yes, we make it a cinnamon muffin\".  So why not put \"cinnamon muffin\" on the menu so I know what I'm getting into?   False advertising.     This was the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life.  Prior to this, the worst breakfast I'd ever had was in a dingy hostel in the worst part of Rome, in which the breakfast was fake juice and a crust of bread.   Well done, PapaGallo.  Also the obsession with rooster decor was a little creepy.",

However, like other places similar to PG- the wait time adds up when you're running a small business. We came for brunch on a weekday and waited over an hour to get our food. Once the food came out, it was excellent. But again, if you're in a hurry you will probably leave a bit frustrated.   I had the butternut squash soup, and salmon scramble. I didn't like how the salmon skin was left on, but the soup was awesome.   I'm torn between giving 3 and 4 stars but decided on four because of their extensive menu and commitment to running their business.",

Dining area is neat, clean, and nicely decorated. I came here for breakfast with my three grandkids. They all wanted Apple juice, but only 2 were available. I ordered coffee and waited for eight minutes before it was delivered. The kids ordered pancakes and French toast with bacon. I ordered a sausage omelet and it came with toast. It was almost a half an hour wait for our food to be delivered. The kids seemed to be satisfied with their meals. My omelette came over cooked ant the sausage was hard as if it was leftover from yesterday. Our total bill for this was $54. Way too expensive for the meals that were provided.

It seems like this chef probably used to take pride in his food but probably stopped doing that a long time ago and now is just open for the sake of being open.  They will brag about how everything is \"homemade\" but who cares if it isn't good?  There is a first watch cafe less than a mile from here, I would suggest you go there for your breakfast instead.",

    "text": "The high chair was filthy. We literally scrubbed it with wipes. I understand sometimes they get looked over when cleaning, but this was beyond that. It was disgusting. Ordered one scrambled egg and a blueberry muffin for my 1 yr old immediately upon sitting down. The muffin was at least a week old. It was hard and crumbly. We told the waitress. She felt the other ones and said, \"this one is kind of soft\", and left the old ones in the case. We passed on the muffin. The egg we ordered for my daughter took 20 minutes. One egg. Not to mention they charged $3.50 for ONE scrambled egg. Food was decent, nothing spectacular, and took 30 minutes to come out after ordering. It was overpriced, in my opinion. The servers were very friendly. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "There seem to be some polarized opinions on PapaGallo, which is a total bummer. Cute little breakfast/lunch spot, with daily specials and cookies and a welcoming atmosphere. The service was a little slow, but the waitress was super friendly and I was with good company so I hardly noticed.  The Greek salad blew away my expectations. The veggies were fresh and crisp, the tomatoes were sliced and grilled, and the dressing brought a comfortable balance to the rest of the medley (crumbled cheese, olives, etc.). Served with garlic bread to soak up anything left over on the plate.  I couldn't resist trying a peanut butter blossom, mostly because it had an unorthodox two(!) Hershey kisses on top. You should probably try one, too. You know, just to make sure.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is very traditional Italian. I imagine what it is like somewhere in Tuscany. The waitress was really nice too and even though she was by herself always filled our coffee cups. I ordered a vegetable omelet, which was fresh and cooked perfectly. The taste was fantastic. The only problem was the size, as I was still hungry when I finished. The other issue? The price. A tiny bowl of fruit was $3.50. And a side of tomato slices for my wife, just two slices, was $3.50. That's a little much. The food, atmosphere, and service was great. The price however will probably prevent us from coming back.",

    "text": "I usually never review- I leave that up to my husband.  But this time I feel the need. I will say the food was good and fresh however so overpriced. I asked for tomatoes with my breakfast and was charged $3.50 for 2 measly slices. I don't mind paying extra- actually I usually expect it- but I think this was a little overpriced. Also, an up-charge to poach eggs? Really.  A small fruit cup - $3.50 - with 8 grapes, 2 blackberries and minced cantaloupe. Um? Where's the rest?!? For that reason, not worth the prices, we won't go back. Luckily we had a Groupon - which made it somewhat better.",

    "text": "At the start, I'm a diner fan.  I really enjoy the morning experience at a breakfast place.  I've been a regular for years around the area but that all changed with the discovery of PapaGallo.  I'm hooked and I've introduced friends to the experience.  My biggest concern in raving is that too many others will decide to make this a favorite morning place.  Len, the chef and owner, goes out of his way to go above and beyond what's even on an impressive menu.  He seems to always be willing to create something new and a bit different than the usual.  The service is done by all with a friendly smile.....a perfect way to start the day!  The complaints re the wait time might be True for someone in a major rush.  Those people might do better with a sandwich from McDonalds.  If you want a great start to your day, this is definitely the place to start!",

    "text": "I've been trying local breakfast eateries recently. Hands down this was the best food, service, and atmosphere. First of all it's a PRETTY little restaurant decorated with a Tuscan theme that I would love in my own kitchen. We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we liked. They were not very busy so the service was quick and attentive. All food is made (exceptionally well) to order so it took some time and I suspect if they were busy you might have to wait a little longer fir your food. The good news is IT IS SO WORTH THE WAIT!!!! I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. They were beautifully plated and presented with a lovely fresh fruit garnish. Almost too pretty to eat, but the taste lived up to the visual! Two warm soft tortillas topped with two fully cooked (I like them this way but you can request, medium or soft or however you like your eggs) eggs, smothered in a delicious chunky salsa and topped with warm gooey melted Monterey Jack cheese. On the side, topping the folded second tortilla was a small (but perfect size) serving of spicy black beans. I left with a full and happy belly!   Oh and the other great thing? I have noticed that even the breakfast places with good food, usually have mediocre coffee at best, and some have downright awful coffee. PapaGallo Cucina coffee was quite good and I am a confirmed coffee snob!",

You are greeted immediately with a warm smile and prompt service. I always like to sit at the bar looking into the kitchen.... and then you meet Len the owner and only chef I have seen here. Always always welcoming... smiling...i feel like calling him uncle Len lol. It's a wonderful experience.  ... and then! You open the menu and learn about specials of the day... there's much to choose from. ALWAYS made fresh and with love. Healthy... flavorful...DELICIOUS!! I highly highly recommended this place over and over.",
