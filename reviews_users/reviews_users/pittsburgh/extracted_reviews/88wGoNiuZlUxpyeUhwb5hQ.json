    "text": "Charming and quaint little restaurant and a great place to enjoy the nice weather! We sat on the porch and had courteous, efficient service. Menu is very limited to a few specials. I had the panko crusted Hawaiian shrimp with pineapple-mango dipping sauce and roasted red-skin potatoes. The meal came with a side salad and fresh bread. Everything was top notch! Hubby had the crab stuffed shrimp in a butter sauce with brown rice. The shrimp and crabmeat were very fresh, with little breading. Both meals were very filling and delicious! The disappointment came with dessert. We ordered the three chocolate drizzled macaroons to share. We attempted to cut the middle macaroon to split in half, which was impossible! It was then we discovered it was burnt. The is nothing worse than the smell of burnt coconut! The chef had to have noticed this cookie was inedible when plating. No attempt was made by server to remove the cost of dessert from the menu. Dinner was great but don't order dessert!",

And I am hopeful that they will improve this spring.  I stopped in for lunch today because I wanted to check the place out and I was looking for someplace I could pick up wifi.   The space is quaint and cozy - with a nice fireplace in the middle.  They layout was a little strange - lots of tables in a small space.  Even though there was a fireplace - the place was cold - I wanted to keep my coat on. The food was just ok.  I had a veggie wrap.  I am hopeful this place will pick up in the spring and be great for the summer months.",

The porch is a nice space and there's definitely enough room to have a dog without bothering any other tables... and they brought our dog water, which was nice.  It's definitely more of an old school cooking style eatery.  I had a filet and my husband had some sort of fish.  My steak had a great char on the outside yet was pink, just as I wanted, on the inside.  But, there was a lot of butter... on everything.  It made our meals feel very heavy and it wasn't necessary.  The potatoes and vegetables were drenched in butter.  I'm a potato lover and I left them on my plate.  I just couldn't bring myself to eat any more butter.  I'd go again, maybe for lunch or drinks, to sit on the porch.  But, it'll be a while before I have dinner there.",

Kids on scooters, ladies rushing to parking meters from the hair palour next door to put money in the meter with the smocks still on and hair in all kinds of conditions...lol.   Nice little menu of Soups, sandwiches, salads, wraps.  Ordered the Salmon (encrusted with dijon mustard0 salad special of the day.  Was informed it was the last one and I did not go late.  Salad had fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, carrot and came with 2 slices of a nicely toasted bread.  The salmon was over powered by the mustard due to the large amount put on top, so I took some off.  Unfortunately, the salmon was under cooked.  Had a similar salmon salad at a restauant a few doors down recently that was better and less expensive, and that restaurant is much fancier.  Note:  OPEN Monday thru Friday 11 to 9. Note 2:  Was advised to make sure the meter was feed, so as not to get a parking ticket.",

It smelled good, but he inhaled it before I got the chance to taste.  He also ordered the special, which was a chicken salad in a cornucopia shaped bread on top of arugula.  The salad was delicious!  It had grapes and cranberries in it, too.  I wanted a cod sandwich, but the server said they didn't have any fish that day.  It's probably because they put them in the other soup of the day, which was the mediteranean seafood.  I got the grilled ham and swiss sandwich served w/ coleslaw and chips.  My meal was also delicious!  You would think that grilled cheese is plain, but they grilled the sandwich perfectly: breas was crunchy yet soft.  It was a big serving as well.  I definitely could've taken half home.  I also enjoyed the slaw eventhough I'm not a huge coleslaw person.  Server was friendly and this place definitely has a homey feel.  It hot busy at lunch time.",

I don't know if I would call it famous, but it was good. The onion rings were also good. Chris had the special turkey wrap with peppers and he really enjoyed it!  All in all the food was good but the service and picturesque porch were really what would bring us back! I loved the gardens on the side as well! I didn't poke my head into the main restaurant but Chris visited the restroom and said it was musty like old cigarette smoke, so I'd recommend visiting when you can sit outside.",

We were there recently for lunch and our server was remarkable for his lack of concern for our needs and general careless demeanor.  When my friend asked if there was milk in the tomato soup, instead of going into the kitchen, the server yelled into the kitchen from the dining area.  Even his attire reflected his sloppy attitude.  When the food arrived, my BLT consisted of slabs of bacon the consistency and taste of cardboard, two small pieces of lettuce, and two tiny slices of unripe tomato.  My friend ordered a cup of tomato soup.  It looked as if the cup had been dragged through the pot of soup because the outside of the cup was dripping with the soup.  It is a real shame that the owners of what was once a fine restaurant have allowed it to devolve into a third-rate diner.",

We sat outside on the porch, which is beautifully decorated, surrounded by trees and flowers, and on a nice quiet street.  I ordered the albacore tuna wrap with a side of onion rings.  The tuna wrap was OK -- I knew it would be simple: the menu boasts albacore white tuna salad, shredded lettuce, tomato & carrots.  Unfortunately, the wrap I received didn't seem to have much \"tuna salad\" at all.  Instead, it was filled with somewhat dry tuna that didn't have any sort of dressing or seasoning.  The wrap was also missing tomatoes.  The saving grace for me was the onion rings, which were not your typical half-inch thick, gigantic onion rings that most places serve.  These were all nice and thin with just enough breading.  I don't typically indulge in stuff like that but they were just too darn good!  I am hoping to give this place a few more chances -- it's close to my office and my dining partners both enjoyed their meals, so I'm thinking my boring wrap was just a fluke.  They offer a great variety of lunch items and the porch looks like it'd be a nice place to grab dinner as well!  Edit: I went back today (the same day I wrote this review) with my coworkers and ordered the roasted turkey salad.  Just when I thought this place was so-so, they went and TOTALLY redeemed themselves.  I don't know what they did to the turkey but it was fantastic. Moist, smoked, with the crispy outer skin still in tact. The salad itself was simple: lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, carrots and black olives.  It was so good.  A nice portion too, but healthy enough to finish and not feel bad about yourself one bit.  I really want to come back here and check out their dinner menu and/or brunch, it all sounds so yummy. And it's BYOB for the time being -- I noticed an application for a liquor license posted in the window!",

Interesting menu with seasonal choices that change often enough to go back often. I had the grilled shrimp with pesto linguine and asparagus and peas. A lovely green dish!  Very tasty. The shrimp may have been a tad over cooked. Hubby's dinner of tuna was perfectly cooked or should I say uncooked. He's very fussy about his raw fish and pronounced it delish. We started with 2 appetizers. A scallop thing that was a bit blah. But the slaw underneath was excellent. And a calamari on skewers that was yummy with a sweet spicy sauce. We finished with a key lime pie that I thought was wonderful with fresh lime zest. I had a nice Italian white wine that I enjoyed. The only downer  was a Caesar salad I ordered. It was pre made wilted and refrigerator cold with soggy croutons. Up side,lovely shaved Parmesan on top. We love this place and will come back. One little glitch will not keep us away!  And the looks of the new sidebar is very appealing so we want to try that soon. Some how I never posted this review!!  Well we went again and the food was delish again. Calamari. Tuna and fish tacos. Lovely area to enjoy the outdoors. One huge downside tho. A man sitting there chewing tobacco and spitting into the yard. I'm still nauseated as I remember. I was getting ready to change tables when Thank Goodness they left. He returned but wasn't chewing. I hope I never see that again",

We had reservations and I'm glad we did, this place is tiny. Majority if their seating is outside, so once it's a bit warmer they could handle more people. Since its tiny the tables are close together, but this point, that's the norm for restaurants. It was a homey feel to say the least.  They have a very short rotating menu, but they keep their Facebook page up to date so you can see what the specials are for the week before going. Luckily for me they had their blue cheese crusted Scallops on special. The portion was the biggest portion of scallops I've ever had and the blue complimented the taste of the scallops so well. It came out piping hot so it was delicious!! My fiance got the blue cheese crusted filet, which was cooked to perfection. We decided this blue cheese crusting is their thing! Our meals also came with a side of our choice, fresh bread and a salad. We were full! It is BYOB, but our waitress said they almost have their liquor license. I would imagine you'd need a good server to tell you the options in appetizers, sides and dessert since none of this is listed on the menu. Which we did this evening. I'd say we look forward to coming back soon when the weather breaks and enjoying a nice meal outside in the cute neighborhood of Aspinwall!",

After having a different restaurant mix up my sons rehersal dinner details, we came to the Front Porch only a few weeks before the big event. They were kind, accomodating and could not have been happier to make this special event perfect. They shut down the indoor restaurant for the event and played beautiful music. They attended to our every need. It was a perfect event and the food was delicious! If I could give 10 stars I would. Thank you to Lou and his staff.",

One of the specials they had on the menu was their tossed salad covered with smoked salmon, strawberries, and feta cheese. I ordered that and got it rather quickly.  For some reason the salmon didn't agree with me so I asked if they would swap it out for their chicken salad which was made the same way but with farm raised chicken.  The swap out was definitely much better and you could tell the chicken was fresh and moist. The staff was very friendly and attentive to my needs. The portion size was huge so believe me I wouldn't have been able to eat dessert even if they had offered it to me. There is also a small bar area.  They have a beautiful fresco art on the side which is worth looking at. I would advise if coming to get here early because this place does fill rather quickly. Open seasonal only during the warmer months.",

Their front porch is cozy and surrounded by flowers and leafy trees...such a picturesque ambiance in which to enjoy dinner on a warm summer night!   The dinner menu is quite limited and it changes frequently...check their website or facebook pages for what they're currently serving. It's a bit on the expensive side (most dinners are $20+), but the food is fresh and high-quality, so I don't think it's outrageously priced. On our recent visit, we started with the homemade chips and seasonal salsa (mango). The chips were big and almost pita-like...the texture was a perfect balance of crispy and chewy. It was a great base for the sweet and spicy mango salsa, which was flavorful and refreshing. For my dinner, I got the almond-crusted chicken breasts with red potatoes as my side. The meal also comes with bread and salad (which I skipped). The chicken was simply prepared but done very well...the chicken was moist and juicy and had a nice nutty crunch from the almond coating (the chicken they use is also all natural without antibiotics, which I appreciate). It was paired with a sweet ginger sauce that was delicious. The red potatoes also were quite simple....roasted with a little oil and spice...but cooked to perfection. My two dining companions both ordered the jumbo coconut shrimp and were pleased with the flavor and texture of their shrimp. Food doesn't need to be overly complicated or have a million components to be delicious...it just needs to make sure the elements it does have are executed well. The food at Luke and Mike's is certainly executed well.   They used to be BYOB, but now they have a liquor license and are serving up booze. I've never had drinks here before, but their cocktail menu had some enticing choices, so I'll just have to come back. :) They also are open for brunch now on Sundays as well, which I'd love to check out. Overall, if you're looking for a place where you can sit outside, watch life go by, and enjoy a good meal, check out Luke and Mike's.",

    "text": "WE LOVE Luke and Mike's Frontporch.  We are very impressed with the cleanliness, service and food.  We are fortunate enough to be able to eat several times a week and have found Luke and Mike's to be our \"go to\" establishment.  We also had the pleasure of hosting a party of around 60 (inside and outside) for a sit down appetizer(s), dinner(s) and cocktails.  Everything was handled perfectly and the compliments were incredible!  The owner's actually opened the restaurant to us on a typically closed evening.    We are extremely picky eaters and I don't review many places due to that.  Luke and Mike's is definitely a place to try!",

I ordered the herb crusted salmon..... it was OK. Very nice piece of salmon but the herbs they put on it were not my favorite. The wife got the fish tacos and she said they were good and the kids split a chicken tender plate. I hate to say it but, the chicken tenders were amazing. The cheapest thing on the bill was the tastiest. We will most likely go back and try something else on the menu. Good atmosphere and the staff was very nice. The dining room is a lot smaller than I expected, the porch area is twice the size of the dinning room.",
