I term this branch \"Good Ole Faithful,\" as they have come to my aid during many times of need, which possibly includes Saturday nights at 2am (sorry for having to deal with me, guys). The pizza is freakin cheap and pretty damn good, especially for the price. I maybe (/definitely) use to call them every Monday when they had an extra-large one-topping pizza AND an order of bread sticks for only 9.99...... 9.99! I'm not sure that they still run this deal, but I could generally get a large cheese for about 10 bucks, and you can't really beat that. Not too greasy, just enough but not too much cheese, their pizza (and actually other food items, which is surprisingly quite extensive) is better than average and tasty for a night in alone or stumbling in with friends after a night out. I usually just walked over, where's it's perfectly nestled in the shopping center across from Mad Mex and Buffalo Blues on S. Highland- however, they deliver too- and both options are surprisingly quick. Enjoy!",

I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour. One irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \"we don't have those anymore\" or \"no, we can't cook wings dry.\" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.",

The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them.   Maybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone.",

It would have been very easy for the staff to have been a little anxious to leave (as it was close to closing time) but I must say......it was a wonderful, pleasant experience - Jess, the friendly girl who took my order, was VERY kind and explained that it would take a few minutes for them to cook up a delicious slice of pizza for me. She set the expectation, kindly chatted with me during the few minutes it took for my pizza to cook and also handled another situation with a customer who came in after me with grace and poise. Thank you, Jess! Fantastic customer service and to be honest, even if the pizza didn't taste \"great\" (which it DID!!) it wouldn't have mattered due to my amazing experience! Thanks!",

I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.",

    "text": "I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.  But their pizza was remarkably terrible.  Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \"personal\" pie, costs $7 and is 7\" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \"small,\" which is 10\". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.  There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.  The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \"I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\" pizza is, and started eating.  Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \"well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \"it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\"  I ate three out of the six \"slices.\" (One sixth of a 10\" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.  Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.  Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.  I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.",

Pizza Parma's tzatziki (cucumber sauce) was a little thin and runny, but the flavor was good. The pizza was well composed with small, crisp rounds of pepperoni evenly covering the surface. The cheese and sauce on the pie was balanced nicely and not too saucy or cheesy.  Crust was quite thin, not too bubbly or voluminous. All in all I was very pleased with my Pizza Parma experience. The pizza I had tonight was tasty and a little above average but the gyro was a True delight.",

I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour. This was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible.

I think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though. The texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy.",

A woman answered and said the driver had been there 15 mins ago and was returning the food to the restaurant because they couldn't get a hold of me. I ordered on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdelivery.com&s=609b2d31420216f9eba23465871ae01c6c8912717f0ab28d274af73b53d57cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">delivery.com</a>, my phone number was correct. She'd given the driver the wrong number. It was correct in the order, but she wrote it down incorrectly. She didn't apologize, she didn't acknowledge her mistake, all she said was, \"The driver will be there shortly.\" And she hung up. When I finally got the food after 95 minutes, the items were soggy and dry, respectively. They didn't offer to remake it. I'm livid. I'd ordered Pizza Parma a few times from the office, and have never gotten it exactly right. This was the last straw. Soggy nachos? Cold, dry chicken fingers? Ain't nobody got time for that! Never again.",

We called up Pizza Parma and ordered a pizza for delivery. Even with the worst cell reception in the tri-state-area, the guy stayed on the phone patiently, and made sure to get my order, my adress and credit card info.   a half hour later our doorbell rang, and a nice guy in his mid-50s was there with our pizza and when we answered the door he said \"I brought you a hoagie too... we made an extra!\" I ended up shooting the breeze with him about the neighborhood for about 5 minutes. He was so friendly!  the Sub was a cheesesteak, and it was AWESOME.   The pizza was pretty solid, and the service was great. The pizza seemed a little expensive, but all things considered, it wasn't as bad as some.   I will likely order from here again!",

My boyfriend and I made the mistake of having dinner at 4:30pm for some reason (the fact that it gets pitch black at 5:30 during the winter still throws me off here) and were STARVING by 11pm.    In realizing that we were going to have to pull an all-nighter due to leftover work to do, we were scouring the internet for a decent place that delivered to Point Breeze at that time.  I found Pizza Parma and we ordered a medium Chicken Pesto pizza.    First of all a medium pizza is HUGE.  It is the same size or larger to any Pizza Hut or Dominos pizza I have ever seen.  The price was good.  A huge medium pizza with excellent ingredients and a 2 liter for $20.  Finally, it came super fast: around 20 minutes.    Overall, an excellent late-night delivery experience!",

    "text": "Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.  The pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).  As the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.",

Prices are decent - though when it comes to a salad at lunch, $10.99 seems steep. Parking is difficult in this area - there is a small lot in front but spots are tough to come by. Street parking in the area also. Usually can find something since it's just for pick up.",

You see kids, My last review was removed, it was a two star (ha, now you lose a whole other star, smarty pants turn me inner) because I spoke about how horrible the pizza was. How utterly disgusted I was with it.   For your sensitivities, I'll be less graphic this time around, okay kiddo?  I spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza. My gut was a mess and calling a spade a spade, the pizza is overpriced for the quality or lack of quality, that is.  The hoagie was no better. Even my six year old thought it was horrid and that kid almost eats anything.   I still recommend eating at other pizza places because I feel it's my yelping duty to save others from a gross, disgusting dining experience.   Plus, it took forever for us to receive said pizza, as if some master mind spent quality time, assuring it's rancidness.  Whatever. Go ahead and turn me into the Yelp police for being honest about your bad, awful, terrible pizza!",

Although she said nobody had complained about it before, the woman who answered the phone went out of her way to figure out how best to keep them crisp. They ended up wrapping the whole styrofoam container in foil which did the trick. I really appreciate businesses that are willing to listen to customers even if it's the first time they've heard what they're saying.

This pizza is my favorite so far not because of their special heart shaped design but because of the basil flavoring in their sauce that gives to a more authentic delicious pizza.   I ordered sausage and pepperoni heart shaped pizza that was outstanding. We ate the whole thing (2ppl).",

Pretty average experience, I had food to go but I would not come back for food. I don't expect the pizza being any different , this seems like a late night  bar with below average food that is only tolerable when you are too drunk to comprehend what you are eating.",

It's certainly not one of the Pittsburgh classics-- the Sorrento's/Fiori's/Mineo's pizzas of the world-- but it works. We got cheese bread and cheese pizza. They definitely don't skimp on the cheese, which is awesome, but the flavor wasn't quite there for me. Especially with the cheese bread, you definitely need the marinara dipping sauce or garlic butter sauce to give it that little bit of kick. But overall, I'd order it again.",

The cheese was really tasty and rich so it was good to ask for less cheese (especially if you're a pizza sauce fan like I am). The crust was also really good. Not too thick. I'm a N.Y. pizza fan so I don't like that type of crust you're going to get from sorrentos or whatever that is thick undercooked and falling apart.  Great take out pizza. It's a little pricey for the pizza - that's why I took off a star. It was ~$20 with tax for a large pizza.",

    "text": "I've lived in Shadyside for about ten months now. This place had become my go-to.  The pizza is still good, no question.  But, I'm still struggling with simple things here.  I order the same salad, EVERYTIME! Mediterranean, add chicken, no cruton. NO CRUTON! I'm guessing out of twenty (at least), I've not had cruton 3 times. The menu says the salad comes with cruton, but their computer screen doesn't show cruton as an option to subtract. They've showed it to me. But the food prep area has cruton on the guide. Again, I've been shown.  I just don't like crunchy then soggy bread chunks on salad. Sorry...  This last time I kinda lost it and called them out on fb. I was immediately called to remedy the issue with free everything. That's not how I roll, though. I don't want free food for their constant mistake. I usually eat half the salad with dinner and take the other half for lunch. Hence the now gross af soggy bread all through my salad.   Also, I ask for an extra side of sauce to dunk my crust in. Every time I order pizza. I have received the extra sauce 4 times in 22. Yes, at this point I'm counting.  To their credit, after multiple text exchanges with the \"manager\". Which in itself was weird that they would think it ok to randomly send me a message just because they have my phone number on file. I have a credit of my purchase cost under my phone number. But am wary to use due to possible retribution.",

    "text": "I was here a few weeks ago after my friend and I left this bar. The closing time for this spot was 2am. We came in at about 1:30 maybe 1:40. We were immediately ignored and told that they aren't serving pizza anymore because they are closing. (We actually left the bar earlier to get here so we could get something to eat before bed) on yelp the closing time was 2am.   Long story short - we practically had to beg them to make us the smallest pizza that would take maybe 10 minutes, which would still have them done by 2am. They were rude and annoyed and probably spit in our pizza. The pizza sucks, everything about it. The cheese, the sauce, everything. Definitely not homemade or using fresh ingredients. It's really not that difficult to notice or taste those kind of things.  Although I don't want to completely rip into their business, I have some advice. 1. Update your account on your website or yelp if you want to close at a certain time and stick to that 2. Fire you're staff and hire new people to work for you 3. Maybe reconsider the menu and ingredients because you have a lot of other competitors in this part of town",

Pizza Parma offers gooey cheese, fresh toppings. The crust is decent but what is really holding this pizza back is the sauce. Improve the sauce and I can guarantee you that the ratings will move more towards 5 stars. As for me, I'll continue to look for a good pizza joint in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "My friend is about to have a baby, and we have been ordering a ton of pizza for pick-up in Shadyside lately.  Since I have ironed through most of the places in Squirrel Hill, it's fun to try the other pizza places.  Maybe my friends and I hit Pizza Parma on an extra good night, but we thought the pizza was better than Pizza Perfecta just down the street.  Even better, Pizza Parma has a parking lot!  We ordered an extra large cheese pizza ($13.99 special) and an order of breadsticks ($4.99), and we were told the pizza would be ready in fifteen minutes.  They totaled $17.10 (lower than we expected from menu prices), and I threw a couple dollars in as a tip because the people working at Pizza Parma were so nice!  The man behind the counter was so friendly and everyone working here seemed to be happy.  Plus, our pizza was ready in ten minutes so score.  This was a pretty standard cheese pizza.  There was lots of cheese, which was great.  It wasn't overly spiced sauce nor was the crust special, but we enjoyed the pizza.  The breadsticks were good, but I wouldn't order them again.  They were the circular pizza crust kind, and I prefer the fluffy kind of breadsticks.  All in all, we will probably keep ordering takeout from here.  Other reviewers seem to have other stories about here, but I suspect they have similiar issues to Pizza Bellino in Squirrel Hill.  Some pizza does not survive the delivery process very well.  This pizza wasn't so good once it sat, but it was yummy fresh out of the oven!",
