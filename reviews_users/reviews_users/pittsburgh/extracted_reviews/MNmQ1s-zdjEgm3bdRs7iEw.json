I had the bangkok spicy vegetable curry- very good.  two days later, i went back again and ordered the spicy coconut soup... BEST noodle soup.  I can't wait to go back, even though I have to drive 30 minutes to get there.",

    "text": "After reading all the raving reviews about this place, I decided to order some take out to try it out. I went with the classic pad thai and Spicy Pad Phet Nuea (spicy lean ground beef with bell pepper, basil, and green beans). Both dishes which I am familiar with at most Thai restaurants. The Pad Phet Nuea was more for the boyfriend since its a bit more healthier compared to other dishes on the menu. Here is my take on it, and perhaps I hold a pretty high standard for Thai food.  The tofu in the classic pad thai are cut into small cubes that are fried. It was a bit dry and very chewy (as if its been sitting for a while). The flavor was a bit more plain then what I am compared to.   The Pad Phet Nuea was delicious. Normally there isnt green bean in it, but I was okay with that. They do put a little more sauce so I got to mix that with rice and loved it.  Otherwise, the plates are a bit pricey for Thai food in my opinion, most dishes are 11.50 to 13.50 with seafood items from 14 to 16 bucks. Good portions since I still have some leftover in the fridge for lunch tomorrow :) I MAY try to come back to this place to give it another chance, but i wasnt impressed. Also, if you need chopsticks and plastic ware for your take out, make sure you ask for it before you walk out the door!",

My food came out about three minutes after I ordered during a fairly busy lunch hour -- which makes me think that the pre-cooked noodles get covered in pre-made sauce and sent out the door.  Good for a quick fix of Thai food- not great.  Angkor in Greentree is still the best in the Burgh.",

Likes: Their prices are very reasonable, a lot of variety for meat eaters or vegetarians, very homy atmosphere which is great for dining with a friend or company.  Dislikes: The vicinity was a bit too small and compact for my liking like you're seated close in proximity to the other diners, single servings are a bit too large, their hours are confusing, and the young hostess came across as unfriendly (even during my next few visits to the business).  Overall, the Green Mango has a great unfamiliar taste of Thai cuisine for those who are willing to explore new palates rather than having your typical oriental foods, which probably consists of Chinese takeout or sushi.",

Spicy Noodle Hut Special with shrimp (Ok don't balk at the 10.50 price tag because seriously this could be a meal for one!  It was so good and the heat was just right)  Pad Thai with chicken (my fiance ordered it and couldn't finish it because of the soup, but that meant more for me :).  This was very good a nice flavor and a lot of chicken)  Red curry with shrimp (So good, I am actually having the left overs today)  There is not a lot of time that thai food will make me gush, but I loved this restaurant.

Unfortunately the Thai spring rolls were fairly boring and I've had much better chicken satay with peanut sauce elsewhere. I was really surprised by the drunken noodles. It was as if someone spilled a whole bunch of red pepper flakes all over the dish. I knew it was supposed to be hot, but I didn't expect to be choking on the dish. I was constantly crunching down on red pepper flakes. I feel like the dish could have been reasonably tasty if I could have tasted anything other than fire.  Maybe I just didn't order the right things on the menu, but I probably won't be back to test that theory.",

We had previously frequented the Regent Square location but tried this location for the first time last weekend. It was a cold and rainy night, so I risked trying the unknown for the sake of easier parking. I was delighted to be greeted by an employee that I often see in Regent Square, so I immediately felt at home.  I absolutely love The Green Mango's Chicken Pad Thai and Phuket Pineapple Fried Rice. Both entrees are equally delicious, but I generally go for the Pad Thai since it's such a comfort food. I've tried Pad Thais at other restaurants in the city and in Florida (where I'm from), but The Green Mango's is by far my favorite.  Needless to say, it's a great restaurant, and I recommend trying any of their locations. We dine at The Green Mango about once/month, so I'm sure I'll be dining there again sometime soon!!",

They always taste super fresh, delicious, and come with great dipping sauces. I personally am obsessed with the sauce that comes with the duck rolls, and request that even when I order something else. My husband got the Thai shrimp spaghetti which was very good. It was like the Thai version of an American spaghetti with marinara sauce, but with more robust flavors. I got some type of shrimp with vegetables that was also very fresh and we were serve both of our orders and hardly no time at all. They also offer the bubble teas which we tried once but I wasn't really a fan of them. The service is always good and the employees are pleasant. I will say that we do order takeout more than dine in and when we arrive to pick up our food we are never left waiting. I am glad there's a place in Monroeville that offers some variety to the normal choices.",

I didn't taste lime or spice in the dressing. The tofu seemed crusty & old. I barely got halfway through it & had to throw the rest out, because it tasted \"off\".

My mom went with me and had the shrimp basil. The dish advertised eggplant which was scarce and had a price that was undercooked. The shrimp was bland. It basically was a fish that consisted mostly of green peppers and several overlooked shrimp scattered here and there. It had more green peppers than anything.  The atmosphere is pleasant. Not too bright or too drab. The biggest downfall outside of the basil shrimp is the wait staff. They aren't rude, but they seem disinterested in doing their job. It's hard to get a server to refill a drink, and they just seem like they'd rather be doing anything else.  I may come back again, but it'll likely not be my idea.",

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with what I had!   For appetizers we had the Spring Rolls and Beef Somosa's. Spring Rolls were pretty good and I really liked the flavor of the Beef Somosa's. They had curry in them, along with peas and carrots, an interesting and flavorful combo.   For entrees we had Drunken Noodles, Beef Pad Thai and I had the Pineapple Curry...it was amazing. The curry had just the right amount of heat and the coconut milk broth was so delicious. I would highly recommend that and will definitely be back to get it! Both the Drunken Noodles and Beef Pad Thai were also very tasty.   While I still favor the atmosphere and overall experience of Nicky's more than The Green Mango, I will definitely be back when I am craving some Thai and want to stay local in the Monroeville area.",

The appetizers were a little oily but tasted fine, nothing extraordinary. The soup was pretty good, especially on a cold winter. Me and my husband shared a vegetarian spicy basil fried rice and it was pretty good.  The one thing I wasn't impressed about was the service. We were seated at a two person table in the corner which was pretty cramped to begin with. Within 2 minutes of getting our soup and appetizers we got our fried rice. By the time we finished with our appetizers and moved on to the fried rice, it got cold. They should have waited till we were done with the first course to get the entree out. We also ordered some hot ginger tea. While the tea was very flavorful, the sugar was pre added and we usually don't take sugar with our tea.  Overall, the food was decent and so were the prices and portions. I would definitely go back hoping for a little better service.",

    "text": "Nice, laid-back restaurant with good food in a basic strip mall.  It is sandwiched between a microbrewery and a Starbucks, but aren't the hidden gems always in strip malls?  Food was good and filling.  The waitress was attentive when she needed to be and unobtrusive otherwise.  We all had a hard time selecting from the fairly extensive menu but eventually decided on a chicken pad thai, a green curry with chicken, and a tofu dish with eggplant and bell peppers (it appears the menu on the website is a bit out-of-date).  Food arrived promptly.  Other reviews had mentioned that the tofu is made in house; whether it is or not, it was really good, crispy on the outside and light as air.  I didn't think there was quite enough eggplant, but I could eat eggplant all day every day so that isn't saying much.  Another review had mentioned that the fish sauce was overpowering in the pad thai, but aside from the first bite, it was reported that it was not noticeable.  The green curry also went over well, but the spring rolls were not the best I've ever had - the outside was a little too thick and the filling a little sparse.  Thai iced teas were pretty good.  My only gripe was that the appetizers seemed pricey.  I wondered how many they were meant to serve - a 6-piece order of samosas, for example, might be great for a group of friends out on the town, but for the suburban strip-mall atmosphere, it seems like it would make more sense to pare down the size and price accordingly, as the biggest group I saw at the restaurant was a family of four.  Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and while I may not return to this specific location, I will probably check out the Regent's Square location.  If this location is closer to you, I would definitely recommend.",

Sometimes we get take-out from the current location in Monroeville, and it's been generally passable. Today, however, I got tofu & veggie Pad Thai and it was inedible, just plain gross. The tofu was spongy and tasted like it had gone bad, and some of the veggies were mushy and off-tasting. I called to speak to a manager and was told there was not one there, but I could call back later. I asked when a manager would be available, and was told they are in and out, no set schedule. I left a message and don't expect to hear back. A waste of $12, and my time. It's going to be a long, long time before I order from them again, which is a shame because it used to be so good.",

I will have to say that the lunch portions are small and a male patron may need to add an appetizer to thoroughly satiate his appetite. I can't complain because the price was right ($7.50+tax). The ambiance was quaint, clean and cozy without the stuffiness that comes with packing in too many patrons in a confined space. The wait staff were courteous and attentive with genuine smiling faces. I will be back soon to try additional offerings on their expansive menu.",

They were really small and were mostly dough with hardly any filling. Their salad with mango and chicken, however, was pretty good. My entree was the spicy drunken noodles with shrimp. The waiter didn't ask me for a spiciness level so I asked if I could have a four. Had I not specified, I don't know how spicy it would have been. But when I got my food, I couldn't eat it. It was WAY too spicy for me. I had to share my boyfriend's entree with him. He got the red curry, which was really good. Curiously, his was listed on the menu as \"spicy\", like my entree was. He did not specify a spiciness level and his was tolerable. I got mine boxed to go and luckily was able to mix it with enough scrambled eggs to make it edible the next day. I drove an hour to get to this resaurant and I would never drive that far for it again. Some side notes -  This was supposed to be a romantic dinner for our anniversary but this place has almost no atmosphere. No music playing and it's just echoed voices throughout the place. It's pretty small. Also, they don't serve alcohol but it is BYOB with no corking fee.",

We ordered three dishes, one satisfactory, one very bland and one that had an odd flavor, ... what I imagine floor cleaner to taste like.  At the end of the meal the third dish was cleared relatively untouched with no inquiry from the server, which I thought was odd.  Our intentions were to share everything so 2 of 3 wasn't a big deal.  In all it wasn't a negative experience, but not memorable either. Meh, sums it up nicely.",

I myself had the Magic Tofu, which was thin thin strips of tofu mixed with green peppers, some other veggies and served over rice.  My friends had everything ranging from curries to pad thai and their opinions were all very similar, there was no actual taste to the food, it was just bland.

    "text": "Considering the lack of mom n pop restaurants in the area, the green mango is a decent place to satisfy your Thai food cravings. The place is moderately clean, ambience decent and service passable. I have tried their pad thai, fried rice, panang and green curries. The pad thai isn't in the top 5 pad thais I have had and the curries are high on chilles but low on overall flavor. That being said, I will probably come back when I can't make a hike to squirrel hill for Thai food.",

    "text": "My Thai samplings across the city brought me to Monroeville and the Green Mango. I had met the owners at the Taste of Pittsburgh event at the Marriott in Cranberry and had sampled some of their curry sauces. I was convinced I needed to go check it out myself! So I went for lunch to their nondescript storefront near the Sears store (great landmark, right?) and settled in for a good lunch. The atmosphere is bland but I knew that the spice levels of their curry sauces were not so I was anxious to give it a whirl.  The menu was extensive for lunch - perhaps even too much to look at and decisions become difficult when you only have so much time. I ordered and asked, as always, for it to be Thai hot. When my plate arrived my first reaction was one of disappointment. It just didn't look good and tasting it confirmed that it didn't measure up to other Thai places around. Don't get me wrong, it's not that it was bad, it just wasn't very flavorful and it surely wasn't Thai hot. In fact, it wasn't even a 5. The portion was a little small but the price was ok. Not that I won't go back but I won't drive across town to eat here. There are far better Thai places around.  On a positive note, they do sell their bottled curry sauces (both red and green) in the back of the restaurant and I highly recommend picking up a couple of each (green is hotter). They also have their own Thai hot sauce for sale but I'm not a huge fan even though I've been through two bottles!! HA!",

I had never had the tilapia before and it was overly saucy, but tasty.  Not as spicy as I'd expected for Thai food which is good for someone who can't really handle spicy, but potentially disappointing for someone who can.",

The spring rolls were yummy but I did not care for my yellow curry. There was a decent amount of shrimp but the curry itself seemed watery and kinda bland; definitely not what I am used to from Thai food. I ended up just picking out the shrimp and eating the rice. Thai tea and sticky rice were ok. I think there are probably better options in the area for Thai.",

Little did we know that they were in the middle of renovation and moving.  So they weren't in their normal location.  There were signs that said they were located now around on the side of the plaza now.  So we walked around and found it.  There was nobody in the storefront and a few workers in the back.  They came out to greet us and told us that they didn't have a license to allow for customers to eat here.  We had planned to eat here so we were kind of stuck.  We decided just to order take out and go find a brewery to eat our food at.  That actually worked out pretty good but it would have been nice to eat here.  I guess we will have to come back and see how it looks once they are moved and renovated.   As for the food my wife and I shared their Summer Rolls with shrimp and they were really good.  My wife ordered the Pad Se Eu with Shrimp and I got the same thing but with chicken.  I think their wide noodles ranked up there with the other restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.  7 out of 10  for the food.  The noodles were a little soggy but the chicken and spices were good.  We'll have to come back to see it renovated and I will be able to edit this review hopefully for the better.",

    "text": "I really, REALLY love Thai food.  My guilty pleasure is to enjoy a spicy bowl of fat Thai noodles!  It has to be so caloric but Lord when a place does them right it is so heavenly and worth the splurge.  For quite some time I have been wanting to try the Green Mango because we drive near it quite frequently.  So for anyone planning a trip to this establishment you need to know that currently they are only offering takeout.  Most people would want to call ahead to order so you don't have to stand uncomfortably in the small store front they are temporarily inhabiting waiting for your food.  Speaking of temporary structures, they are no longer next to Starbuck, and are eventually moving to another building in the same general vicinity.    Even though we were not prepared to get takeout we decided to just go for it and take it to a local brewery to eat.  We waited about 15-20 after ordering at the counter.  We both got the Pad Se Eu, mine with Shrimp.  I requested extra spicy.  We also ordered the summer rolls.  I thought the pricing was a bit high.  For both noodle dishes and the rolls it came to almost $40.00.    After the wait we got our to-go bag and headed out.  I requested some type of hot sauce, to which they only have sriracha.  A tad disappointed but they are under construction so I accepted and we were on our way.  So how about that food?  Well, I was happy and disappointed at the same time.  First I noted the portions were, in my opinion, small, most especially for the price.  The second thing that literally screamed in my face was, where is the spice?  I asked for extra spicy, this Thai was mild at best.  The flavor wasn't bad but it just lacked that kick that I look for and requested.  The rolls were actually not bad, say a tad bland without using the dipping sauce provided.  Overall it wasn't bad, it just wasn't real good.  I am hoping these issues can be all credited to the current operating system, IE takeout only, temporary location.  That being said I would like to give them another shot when they move into their new brick and mortar to see if there are improvements on quality and quantity.  Hopefully I will be able to have a higher star rating after factoring in some of these changes.",

They gave me chicken tom yum . To be fair the broth was AMAZING, but the chicken was obtrusive and didn't seem to belong in the soup. The drunken noodles were not spicy and very good.   I went here for lunch with friends. Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the drunken noodles-chicken. It was really good! I also had tom yum soup. The soup looked and tasted delicious but after a couple bites the level of spice was too much for me to handle. I had to stop eating it. The waitress changed from a very competent person on the beginning to someone who was not that great. The not so great person took our orders and did not inquire about level of spice. She was slow to refill water as well. I will definitely go back to green mango but I will make sure to specify the level of spice!",

The restaurant was empty. Bathroom was spacious and clean. Decorations were nostalgic of my Thailand trip days...  By the time we ordered it had JUST turned 3pm, which meant that now they charge Dinner prices instead of Lunch prices (look at the menu picture to see the differences in pricing)... That made us kinda annoyed knowing that if we had just ordered 5 min earlier - OR if the waitress had let us known earlier as we walked in or sat down - we would have gotten a better deal. Alas, it didn't really matter since the dinner portions are supposedly larger than the lunch portions and we were starving anyway.   Their Panang curry was on point! 5/5, very tasty, perfect level of spiciness. However, their shrimp summer roll was extremely disappointing, bland, dry and not worth $8.95... The classic pad thai was pretty good but VERY oily - much more greasy than your average pad thai. I wasn't a huge fan. Overall, I would come back when the craving for thai food hits, but probably only order curry.",

Chicken satay for the kids -they love it and it is always perfectly cooked (not chewy or tough).  Yellow curry for us - a really solid choice, they have a achieved a balance between rich/creamy and spice that several other Thai restaurants have not.  Lastly, we usually get an order of Thai fried rice or Pad Thai for everyone to share.  Both are good choices and can be made with your choice of meat or veggies.  The portion sizes are on the large size and we always have left overs.  This isn't the best Thai food that I have ever tried, but it is good enough for me to keep coming back for more.",

    "text": "My lady and I stopped at this restaurant after finding that our intended destination in Monroeville closed for renovations. The reviews on Yelp were good so we figured why not stop here since we were so close. The prices here were fair for lunch and I definitely didn't feel like we over payed. I'm no expert on Thai, but this wasn't my first Thai rodeo either. Their spring rolls were terrific and the sauce that came with them, which they say is an in house recipe, was good as well. I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken and I liked it, but at the same time wish I ordered something else on the menu that I may have liked more. It was good, but it certainly didn't live up to the shining reviews I had read just ten minutes earlier. I didn't see the actual dinner menu, but I'm assuming that it's laid out the same way it is on their website, which was organized by type of dish. Unfortunately their lunch menu could really use some revamping in terms of how it is laid out. The descriptions are nice, but there seems to be no order to the way they're listed. It's just a bunch of entrees thrown onto a piece of laminated paper. It's not a huge deal, but after seeing their website and then being handed a menu that looked like it was from a completely different restaurant was a little odd. If I were stuck in Monroeville for some reason and someone told me I had to eat at the mall food court or The Green Mango, I'd probably choose The Green Mango, but if I were at home and given the option of a ten minute drive to McDonalds or the hour trip to The Green Mango, I'd order a couple McChicken sandwiches and a small fry. Because I feel it's worth noting, The Green Mango does not serve alcohol, but BYOB is fine and there is no corking fee.",

They have several appetizers, such as spring and summer rolls, fried tofu with peanut sauce, and satay. My friends and I usually get one to share before moving on to the main course.   If I'm in a hurry or not very hungry, I simply order the delicious Tom Kha (soup with coconut milk) with shrimp and a side of rice. It is cheap and is fantastic if you have a cold.  Some of my favorite dinner entrees are the tofu Lak Sa (a noodle dish with yellow curry and coconut milk), the pumpkin curry with beef, and the drunken noodles. All are flavorful, reasonably priced, and large servings! I always take something home. A word of caution, thai food can be spicy so order carefully if you get heartburn.   The Green Mango has a nice selection of teas that they serve to you in an individual pot at your table. Their smoothies are also very good!",

We also got some over the top fried rice that came in a half of a pinneapple which was also very tasty. I left this place stuffed which means it was very delicious overall.  I love that this place is BYOB and they don't even charge for it, which equals awesomeness. Unless they forgot to charge me.

Both meals were awesome! I normally order Pad Thai whenever we eat at a Thai restaurant, but this one was by far the best I have ever had. My husband also really enjoyed his meal.",

The food was tasty, but the service was mediocre at best. One of the dishes we ordered was Thai basil and eggplant with beef. We got one piece of eggplant with no visible Thai basil leaves. We sent it back and got 3 more pieces of eggplant. It was more like green peppers and beef. Although it tasted okay, it was disappointing. (If we had ordered beef with green pepper, it would have been alright.)",

The summer rolls were pretty boring. The taro bubble tea was actually a slush rather than just a milk tea, but it was tasty and reasonably priced.",

I'm always trying to get that perfect dish, the one that compares to the chicken basil at Green Mango!     Some of my favorite dishes include:  summer rolls (I always ask for spicy sauce, not the sweet one served with it), green curry with chicken, chicken basil, chang mei noodles, basil fried rice, drunken noodles, lemongrass soup, ginger tea--actually, I've never had a meal I didn't love.  Neither has my family!    The only complaint I have is that when they are swamped the food may arrive at various times (2 dishes, then 5 minutes later 3 dishes).  But it is always hot and fresh!",
