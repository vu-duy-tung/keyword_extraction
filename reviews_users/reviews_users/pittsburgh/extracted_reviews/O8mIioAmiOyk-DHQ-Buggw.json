    "text": "First, let me start this off by saying I LOVE Smokey Bones.  I eat here quite frequently, but tonight's visit left a lot to be desired.  I had my usual, petite sirloin, baked sweet potato, and broccoli.  Waitress seemed like she didn't want to wait on my table. She acted like I was a bother.  Dinner arrives, and my sirloin is way small-- as in much smaller than the 6 oz that I usually get.  This looked to be about 4 oz. size. Baked sweet potato turned into sweet potato fries.  Manager was sent over, and I said I had ordered a baked sweet potato. She proceeded to argue with me that they NEVER had baked sweet potatoes on the menu, and she has been there since they opened.  Also inquired about size of the steak.  She insisted (again arguing with me) that it was a 6 oz. size.  I didn't mention that I was never offered a refill on my drink or my broccoli was cold.  She told me she would comp my dinner \"since you're not satisfied\" (done in a very snotty tone).  Waitress brought check, didn't offer dessert, or a drink refill.  And guess what... no comp for dinner, but that was more than okay because I ate it.    Waitress needs retraining because she messed up two other orders.   Overall, a bad dining experience.  I' think I'll sit out of Smokey Bones for a long while until service improves.    Sad, because I really do love this place.",

    "text": "Lets start this by me saying that you have to take Smokey Bones for what it is, a chain BBQ restaurant outside of BBQ country.  With that said the food here is pretty good, not the best BBQ I've ever had, not even close, but like I said, you need to take it for what it is.  What made my experience really good at the Pittsburgh Mills location was our waitress, Michelle.  She had a really great personality, was \"on it\" with drinks; Michelle was the best \"server\" I have ever had, and that goes with some of the really high end restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at.    Solid food and spectacular service.",

We got an appetizer sampler which was ok but after we got outlet entrees that's when things went wrong! He got ribs which were dry and tough. I got a three meat platter and the brisket was like slices of hard ago leather. I know this is a chain but REALLY? I also got smoked wings which were ok but dry then the smoked sliced turkey was good but the seasoning tasted weird. All I can say is never been that violently ill after a meal and my friend felt the same way the next day!",

After some time, I noticed that several couples, like us, were being seated. I went to the hostess 2 more times, making sure they hadn't forgotten about us. At one point, I mentioned several empty tables. I was told they didn't have staff to cover those tables. Finally, we got seated.  We ordered coffee and the waiter brought it, with no spoon. We didn't notice right away, since I ordered an appetizer. The plate of loaded fries was small for the price, and he asked if we wanted small plates. He dropped the wrapped silverware and plates, got our entree order and dashed off before I could mention the spoon. No problem. She used the wrapped fork.  A food runner brought our entrees, picked up the small plates and dashed away. I realized that we had no extra napkins, just the single ones that contained our fork and knife. I couldn't locate the waiter, and my guest was missing one of her sides.   A quarter chicken consists of a tiny leg and thigh. The brisket was dry, burned and had a lot of fat in it. My guest complained of the same thing. She had the pulled pork and said it was passable. The waiter finally made an appearance, and I advised him of the issues. He brought a few napkins and a food runner brought our missing side, but by this time, we were nearly finished.  He stopped once more to ask about dessert. We asked for the check and got excellent service on that. I guess when it is time to pay, the pace of the place gets quick. It took a while, though, to get my change. I got the feeling that we were expected to leave the change as the tip.  No one asked how our meal was, no one ever came by to check on us. The energy level of the place was rushed and unpleasant. I had heard good things, but the food quality and value were poor at best, and the service was terrible. Perhaps other locations are better.",

I recommend a baked potato or broccoli for sides.  Warning:  the broccoli comes heavily buttered; but you may ask for no butter on the broccoli.  Caesar salad is OK but I didn't care for the mixed greens in the regular side garden salad.  Another perk is a yummy slice of warm garlic toast is served with the ribs platter.

The food is decent,I have never had a bad experience to speak of and the service is usually solid and speedy. The food itself is what I have a problem with the most. Its definitely over priced for the quality and Im not sure how they prepare some of their meals but looking up the nutrition information online is shocking. 810 calories in one serving of sweet potato fries...seriously? 890 calories in 8 very small smoked wings is also shocking although they are very tasty I did not expect them to be that high. The burgers are certainly nothing to brag about and the fact that they are priced higher than Burgatory makes it even more disappointing. I ordered an all Angus beef patty that was very plain and average tasting certainly not comparably to the juicy delicious flavor of a burger from Burgatory.   Overall a nice bar/restaurant setting with speedy/friendly service but for what your getting the food is overpriced.",

If you go for dinner on Friday or Saturday, you'll have a wait. I've sat at the bar a couple times while waiting and found the pours to be on the generous side.  We try not to go those nights because the bar can be full and I don't want to stand for 30-45 minutes.  I am a rib fan and I love their ribs. I mean I LOVE them. To the point where I know that's what I'm going to have every time. Only on one occasion was I less than very satisfied (that time the ribs were dry and chewy) but besides that one-off experience they have been moist and meaty with a little bark on the outside - the way I like them.  Never had a problem with service - prompt, friendly, cheery and attentive. There's an assortment of 4 BBQ sauces at the table that you can choose from, and you can also order the ribs smoked and sauced, or smoked and dry rubbed. Geez, my mouth is watering now.   I've had the smoked wings as an appetizer and they were great. I would skip the mac-n-cheese side as it's a couple of dollar upcharge and was nothing to write home about.  My wife is partial to the pulled pork platter paired with the Carolina-style sauce, and she says to mention that the broccoli side is always a winner, cooked just right.  And if you've thrown caution to the wind for your dining experience, try the hot donuts for dessert, with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces. They are wonderful.  It's probably a good thing that it's a long-ish drive for us or I'd likely be gorging on those ribs far too often. Ribs, mmm.",

    "text": "I've been prompted urgently to write a review.   I'm here with several family members for a reunion in the Pittsburgh area. After gathering our belongings to head for a four and a half hour trip back home we stop at Smokey Bones. One family member was familiar with their food, so with a party of 17 we were on our way. Waiting for our tables to be combined was not long. However, what was long was our wait to receive our food.   The restaurant was NOT crowed, busy, whatever. But somehow we waited for our food for two hours. My aunt and her friend actually received service by another employee, yet they still waited a good while for their food. Keep in mind people who were seated around the same time or after we were seated received their food promptly.   After that two hours of waiting, the manager appeared, but was unapologetic and offered an excuse, which was a lie, that they were busy. It wasn't. Most of us who dine out often know what busy looks like. That excuse and her attitude did not sit well with the family.   They expressed how unsatisfied they were and then we offered with bread. Which, I think, should come out to the table anyways. We should have compensated with an actual appetizer.   Afterwards, the food came out about five minutes later. Some family members were satisfied, others not so much. The chicken sandwich I had was nothing to tell anyone about. I believe the same goes for everyone else's meal. I made sure to ask everyone how they enjoyed their meal.   The meals were discounted but still the discount should have been a bit deeper. All of us has to be some where the next day, children were waiting to eat, we spent a long time waiting, and the manager did not strategize how to approach our table of 17 people who have a long road ahead of them.  NOTE: this review was sitting in my edit back log on my yelp app, but still, I remember this experience like it was yesterday. This place might have single-handedly halted my yelp reviews. No matter, I see new reviews coming.",

    "text": "Came for dinner on 5/19/19, had great food and service from our waiter! Love the BBQ ribs! However the table next to us, had an extremely rude and entitled customer who was treating their server/food runner very rude.  This customer was complaining about the price of a wine and wanted a discount, something that is out of control for any staff that works there.   Ive worked in customer service for years, and I needed to speak up because their server/food runner, Kylie, was giving that table great customer service, with a genuine smile, and tried her best to make the customer happy.   This customer literally waved her hand in front of Kylie saying \"I'm not going to sit here all day and talk to you about this\".  I was appalled at how rude this customer was. She even asked another server what Kylie's name was and wanted her to write it down so she could complain about her, saying for \"customer service reason\" she should have gotten what she wanted.   I spoke to the manager to let her know I witnessed the whole thing and this entitled customer is planning on writing a complaint that is so far from what the reality of the situation was and I wanted to write a positive review for Kylie.   My hope is that if this crazy rude customer tries to get Kylie in trouble or complain about her, that this review will negate her False claims and show that Kylie did a great job handling a difficult situation/customer, so much that a random customer (myself) felt compelled enough to write this review.  Great customer service Kylie, keep it up! That's how you get customers like me coming back :)",

The soup my husband ordered came out as 1/2 a bowl with a spoon the had food hanging off it and a greasy film.  The waitress was nice but didn't offer anything more than a sorry when we brought it to her attention. This was one of our go to restaurants when we went to the Pittsburgh Mills, not any more. There was crud under the tables, the seats coverings had tears in the fabric and both the men's and women's bathrooms needed cleaning.",

    "text": "Anytime I leave a poor reviews, I have a secret hope it can be turned around. I hope maybe a review like mine will be a wakeup call. This was one of those times maybe I was right. After my last poor experience I was contacted by the regional manager who was extremely concerned and truly listened. They really DO read reviews on here , and they care. We ended up being sent a gift card as an act of good faith or an 'apology' of sorts. I'm happy to report we used it already. From the time we arrived to the time we left it was nothing short of phenomenal. The smells alone wafting from the back we're heavenly. The server was amazing. It was lunch time and it was slower as it was a weekday , but they had plenty of take out so they weren't 'dead'.  We decided to go for it and got their famous ribs as well as their pulled pork . We really wanted the brisket but it's not available until 4pm. I can say it was brought out  very quickly and we never had to wait for our server to stop by and check on us. The ribs were literally melt in your mouth. We tried pretty much every sauce they had. The smoked wings were delicious and for those alone we will come back. We went in with an open mind and never once mentioned to ANYONE about the previous experience. Perhaps that evening of poor service  was a one time thing. Even the most fantastic places have off nights. This afternoon however they knocked it out of the park.we loved it, and we will definitely go back. The only reason it's not.a five star review is because the brisket isn't available until 4pm. Even with that we had no complaints. Thank you.",

Got here around 130 pm and the place was packed. We put our name on the wait list with the server who just happened to be our waitress. I watched her for the next 10 minutes run around that place to get everyone taken care of with a great attitude, like she actually wanted to be there. We were finally sat and Angela first apologized about the wait before she even proceeded to tell us her name. Clearly not her fault but it was a nice touch. She gave us some great recommendations for drinks and appetizers that were awesome. We got our food in a timely matter and she had conversation for everyone she was waiting on, even though they were extremely busy. I told her that as long as she is there we will be sure to come back. Great come up smokey bones.",

My husband and I ordered the blackberry iced tea........mistake number 1.   It is so sweet that it's disgusting.    I ordered the nachos as my entree and had them add pulled pork.   My husband got a combination that had dry rub ribs and wet ribs.     Food arrived so quickly that our friends hadn't eaten more than two spoonfuls of their soup.   This is a server problem, not a kitchen problem.   Who wants to be rushed like that?  My nachos were enormous, but had likely  sat in the oven too long as the cheese was like a rock, and the pulled pork (what little there was), was as dry as anything.    My husbands ribs had so little meat on them, he couldn't understand what animal they had come from.    When food is this bad, I normally complain,  but we didn't want to make a fuss with our guests there.  They each got a sandwich and weren't saying anything, so we felt they were ok with their food.     Third time is supposed to be a charm, but not this time.   We need to find another restaurant that is half way for our get together with friends.",

The atmosphere is that if a sports bar with lots on TVs playing a variety of sporting events. There is both bar and dining area drains available. Most of the menu consists of BBQ recipes like pulled pork, brisket, ribs, etc. Other options are available such as pasta and salads and most restaurants offer.  At our most recent visit, we were made to wait for 15 minutes before being seated, despite the fact that the place wasn't even half full. They were clearly understaffed at the time which was the problem, but I do think this is unacceptable.   At the suggestion of the waiter, we tried the buffalo chicken dip app which was a new item on the menu. I thought it was weird because it was made of cut up chicken tenders with the cheese and hot sauce layered on top. I had the BBQ chicken meal which consisted of half of a chicken so if you order this, make sure you're hungry! It was moist but I wasn't overly impressed with the rub.   I've had better experiences here is the past which is why we stopped today, but I will probably go elsewhere in the future if I have other options.",
