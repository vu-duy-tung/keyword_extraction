    "text": "I was in town playing music and saw this pop up on Yelp so I decided to check it out since I absolutely love tacos. It was definitely the right choice.   But before I talk about food, I kind of want to give it a 4 star only because of how small the location was. It seems popular and the food is very good, so I would imagine it's pretty crowded more often than not. I like sitting down to eat and I ended up having to stand outside and eat over my to go container unfortunately. Hopefully they can expand to a larger location because the food definitely made up for it.  Onto the tacos.. The portions were very fair for a taco spot. Normally i go for 3 tacos, but two was more than filling. I went for pollo and carnitas and they were both very tasty and surely a little more unique than your standard street taco because of the ingredients. The chicken taco had avacado and a cholula cream drizzle and the carnitas had a Mexican slaw; and they both came with cheese, pico, cilantro, and lime. I also really enjoy yellow corn tortillas over white corn, so that was a great little surprise. They also had a vegan option available along with a walking taco in a Doritos bag. Pretty awesome!   If you are in the area and overwhelmed with all of the choices nearby, this is a great quick or late night option.",

    "text": "As Munch the food critic says, this is the place to go if you are very hungry and need that immediate taco fix.  The food is so cheap at 3 dollars a taco, that almost anything would be acceptable at that price point.  I was there around dinner time and it was a lively, fun atmosphere(the chef provides jokes to go with his cuisine, he called up my order in a funnyway) and the food comes at you quicker than a freight train.    The ingredient portions are more than adequate which makes the price point better than average.  The ingredients also seem fresh, but for some reason one of my taco's seemed a bit bland.  I got the vegan taco and the pollo taco.  The vegan seemed to have a bit more flavor, but the chicken was a bit bland and had a slightly fishy taste.  I have no idea where that came from.  I honestly think this place is the first of it's kind in Pittsburgh.  I don't know anywhere else where you can get a taco this fast that's this cheap and that is not from a food truck. For that reason alone I will most likely go back more than a few times.  It definitely filled me up for 8 dollars total including a Jarrito's Guava flavored soda.  I had never had the guava kind which was really wonderful.",

    "text": "Last night I planned on getting home from work, working out, eating a healthy dinner and going grocery shopping.  Instead I laid in bed until Pens traffic died down and dragged my roomie out to SouthSide with me to finally try some tacos from this place. And then we got ice cream. And I have no regrets.  This place is so small you almost miss it, but it is located exactly to the right of Twelve on Carson and is adorable when you get inside.  It's narrow with about 8? barstools lining the counter and maybe two other hightops against the window.  It's decorated in sugar skulls and cool, bright colors and I didn't even mind waiting for my tacos because I was taking in all the decor!  It was Taco Tuesday, but there weren't too many other people in there, probably because it was the first really cool day of the season (plus the Pens game!).  Even Tia, the bartender at Twelve who also works behind the counter at Doce was very surprised at how dead it was.  Service was quick.  I got one chicken and one carnitas taco and my roomie got a chicken (minus avocado) and Americano.  We inhaled them and they were excellent.  We ended up ordering one more each.  Our bellies were stuffed full and we paid (a whopping 11 dollars each for 3 filling tacos and a bottle of water) and were on our way!  I agree with other reviewers when they say that these tacos are better than Las Palmas.  Doce's ingredients are carefully and perfectly executed and my tacos weren't falling apart in my hand like they ALWAYS do everywhere else in Pittsburgh.  They were so full of flavor and everything worked together so nicely.  I always find myself having to add hot sauce or more salsa or salt and pepper, but here - what they served was spot on.  I really liked this place and I think they are doing an amazing job.  I didn't mind the small menu at all and thought it was a nice thing to have a special of the day where you could get something different.  It would be nice to add a fish taco at some point to the regular menu though :) Thanks Doce..Cant wait to come back!",

I needed to get a bite to eat to tide me over before meeting a friend for a movie and dinner (in that order.  I resigned myself to Subway because it was across the street from my salon and I knew they'd be cheap and fast, and I had no sooner crossed the street when I noticed the sign for Doce Taqueria.  What's this????? A tacqueria in Pittsburgh???? (Okay, I know they exist, but they're so few and far between in this town.)  Without giving it much more thought, I walked in and was hit by the smell of delicious taco fixins.  There was also a counter full of dudes in there, and I was the only female besides the one working.  It was a little awkward.  I felt like I was invading a Boys Only fort or a secret meeting of the Loyal Order of the Water Buffalo or whatever.  Anyway, I got over that really quickly because this tiny place is full of legit taco goodness.  They have several types to choose from, plus a daily special.  Carnitas, ground beef, chicken, and probably a veggie option if you want it.  I had to hold myself to two tacos served the CORRECT way on two small corn tortillas a piece (I'm judging you if you pick flour), and they were both delicious.  Hell, you can even get a walking taco if you fancy one.  They stay open until quite late on the weekends, which means they must make a killing on the South Side bar crowd.  I'm quite glad that I was able to experience it on a quiet Saturday afternoon, and there's a likely chance that hitting this spot up will be part of my hair appointment routine.",

Doesn't acknowledge me, takes their orders first, so I left. Ehh, whatever (maybe I should've spoken up).  Came back a few days later for the awesome cinco de mayo special and everything was back to normal. Keep up the good work guys (just try to pay attention when customers come in).  Probably the best tacos in the burgh if you're looking for a quick bite. Wish they served alcohol and had seating to accommodate more people but then again, they're surrounded by bars so I can appreciate the dedication to serving up some great grub.  Again, keep grinding... I see a lot of potential to expand and prosper.  Update: The service and food here continues to be excellent. When asked where to grab a great taco in the city, I always point friends and familiy toward Doce. Five stars.",

They aren't your run of the mill ground beef, lettuce and cheese (though they do have their own take on that-if that's your thing).  Their tacos are a small and sold individually so if you're not that hungry you can just grab one for $3, but my husband and I usually stick with three a piece. Its cheap and filling. Perfect for grabbing a quick (and sublime) bite.  Quick being the operative word. You must either grab and go, or plan on woofing it down at their very limited bar seating. This very limited seating, however, in no way takes away from the dining experience. It actually benefits them, and you. It makes the whole experience a certain aesthetic and event, all the while forcing the masses attempting to consume tacos through the line with precision and speed.  I have tried every single taco option they have, and they are all excellent. I have, however, for my tastes, narrowed it down to an ordering formula. I always get the special, the pollo and the carnitas- all on CORN tortillas (that is KEY). With absolute modesty, I can say, it is perfection.  Seriously, if you are looking for tacos and are into well crafted \"foodie\" food. Look no further. Eat here. Trust me.",

Oh, and not only are the delicious, they are cheap!! $3 a taco. Can't beat that. Love the interior decor and I'm a sucker for neon signs lol",

The place can get busy and its not overly clear if you should sit and hope to order or stand at the far end to order and then sit (if available).  My concern is with the sanitary practices at the establishment. Today, my second visit, the lady with the 3/4 tattoo sleeve that was working/taking orders dropped the top of the squeeze bottle for the sour cream/sauce in the trash as she was switching bottles and just picked it out and put it right back on top of the squeeze bottle. Said sour cream/sauce bottle was then used to dress every order there after.  Foul. There is a 3 bowl sink right to her left not sure why it wasnt washed and sanitized then put back on the bottle. Another customer noticed as well and clearly was grossed out as she mentioned it to her friend. The same lady also removes customers trash from the bar, which is great, but she also was putting tortillas on the grill with no gloves, and munching on chips.  However, the guy that was working the food station seemed to have all his safe serve requirments together.  On a side note, they also never informed customers that they were out of avocado for the pollo tacos and when multiple customers asked they just said \"we are out\".  Shouldnt you let the customer know ahead of time?  I was impressed that they compe'ed the food of a police officer that came in for lunch.  So all in all  sanitation and customer service could be better.  If you are ok with those two being out of whack of sorts the food is decent.",

We headed in around 8pm on a Friday, grabbed a parking spot right out front without an issue and grabbed three seats at the counter just the same. We ordered 3 tacos.... 2 vegetarian , 1 vegan. They were the same, just one without the Mexican farmer's cheese. Very tasty and corn is definitely the way to go for your shell. (You choose between corn or flour). We also grabbed classic Jarritos from the case for $2 a pop. My girls ate their tacos in two seconds flat, said they were so delicious and each ate two more! So yea, kiddos approved. They were good and I would recommend them for an inexpensive quick bite. My only gripe with be that they were out of avocado!!! I get that it was the end of the night, but c'mon!",

I definitely will go back and try some of the other options.  I would love to see a shredded beef option :)  Were they the best street-ish tacos I've had in Pittsburgh?  No - that will go to Las Palmas or Reynas.  But they are still really good and definitely the best in Southside!",

Granted that wouldn't fit on the sign and is a mouth-full(pun intended) so Doce Taqueria is fine. A place like this deserves the traffic simply because it 1. Is simple and priced accordingly 2. It is quick and convenient and tasty(quality meat). 3. It's a pleasure just visiting when the staff and ownership are chill chill cool beans.  Bottom line go to Doce if you're hungry and want a taco man.Go if you're not hungry and want a taco. Just go!",

It was indeed a small place, but a very cute taco shop. we were pretty surprised how short the menu is, however, everything on the menu looks so appetizing to me. I ordered three diff tacos: daily special (pork, cucumber, hoisin sauce, and cilantro), pollo, and carne molida. Mmm my favorite one is probably the carne Molida because I'm a big fan of spicy food. The other two were very tasty as well.  We sat at the bar to eat our tacos. At first we came in there aren't many people, about 4 people. However, there were only one guy making tacos. We had to wait awhile for him to take our orders. After we got our orders in, the food came pretty quickly. While we were eating, I found that many people come in and out very rapidly. A lot of people got to go tacos. The price is very reasonable. Overall, My stomach was very content :) We both love it and will definitely come back again.",

Be prepared to stand in line when you come to Doce.. but it is soooo worth the wait! As many others have said it is very small inside.. only a few seats to sit around the bar at but if you go early enough you can take your food and eat it next door at Twelve! Another great thing about Doce is how inexpensive their amazing tacos are. Any taco is $3! Their sides are also cheap too!   We've had just about every taco on the menu at Doce. Some of my favorites are the carnitas & the pollo. All of the ingredients that they use are super fresh and seriously amazing. Even their jalapenos are the best I've ever had.We also ordered nachos for the first time which I would highly recommend. I am a sucker for hot sauce- so I appreciate the wide selection of hot sauces that they have for their customers too. I use just about every hot sauce on my tacos. Keep up the good work, Doce!

    "text": "I visited Doce Taqueria on Tues. prior to a Cinco de Mayo themed Yelp event at another nearby restaurant.  I'd been meaning to stop by, but it'd been awhile since I'd stopped for grub on the South Side.  This event, plus the fact that it was Taco Tuesday, gave me sufficient motivation to check it out.  Because I knew there would be snacks at the event, I decided to go with two tacos ($3 each)--one of the daily special (BBQ pork), and one of the pollo (chicken), both on corn tortillas.  Of the two, the chicken was the more subtly flavored, consisting of the namesake meat plus avocado, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese.  The addition of a spritz of juice from an included piece of lime added a jolt of citrusy flavor, upping the ante.  The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a veritable flavor explosion, consisting of cherry peppers, shredded cheese, and cilantro. Though I enjoyed them both, the special was my favorite of the two due to its bold flavors.  Like many eateries in the South Side, the space is pretty small, with seating limited to the bar and a small ledge by the window, and no real tables.  From my visit, it appeared that the majority of orders were of the carry out variety, but a few other people also ate in, in addition to me.  Service was pretty efficient--my order was out in 5 min, which I appreciated given that I arrived a bit later than I'd planned to.  The decor was quite festive, evoking a kitschy SoCal vibe, which seemed particularly appropriate given the day and time of my visit.  The atmosphere reminded me of a similar taco shop on the North Side, but I enjoyed the food more and found the price point more reasonable.  While I'd rate the tacos at Las Palmas and Edgar's slightly higher, if you should find yourself nearby, I'd definitely say Doce is worth a visit! 4.5 stars.",

I am not a tomato fan, but ate everything that was put in my basket - everything was too good to start picking things off of.  We had several varieties of the taco's along with an order of nachos.  My only \"complaint\" was the size of the shop -- it was really small -- seating was counter-style and at best accommodated 15.  We stopped in during a lull in the lunch crowd and it was still almost full.   We'll be back though - just try to keep a couple of seats open for us.....",

    "text": "Doce Taqueria is just like a gourmet cupcake shop, but for tacos. They're open late and serve their fare up quickly, making them one of my top choices in the neighborhood. Generally speaking, I love the chicken and pork tacos and find them marinated to perfection with crisp, fresh toppings. The staff are extremely friendly (less so when you get closer to 2am, but I don't blame them for dealing with all the drunken shenanigans) and the price isn't too extreme ($3/taco). The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because on my most recent visit, the tacos were just so-so, indicating some consistency issues. They also really skimped on the avocado, which is one of my favorite parts! On my previous visits, all varieties were excellent, but something was just 'off' this time around and my boyfriend agreed (he had a different variety than I did). The shop is super tiny, so seating is tough. All in all, my favorite pick for a quick snack or late night food on East Carson.",

When I decided to give this taqueria a try I wasn't expecting much but after meeting the staff and deciding what to order (Chicken tacos) man was I impressed the flavor, quality and presentation is top notch. This place is very inviting and staff are friendly willing to help and offer some tips on what to order. This place kinda reminds me of the small grab n go style of restaurants you would typically find in downtown districts in many cities across Mexico. Long story short is that I Highly Recommend this place five stars from me. FYI I am not from Pittsburgh but when I am town I make it a point of my stay to visit this place. Pittsburgh you have great place to grab some awesome tacos, go out and support this establishment they are serving great food.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a 3 dollar taco that tastes like a million bucks... then look no further! Made fresh and to your specifications, these are the best and freshest tacos you'll ever put in your mouth. And from what I understand a good majority (if not all) of the ingredients are locally sourced! Now what's not to like about THAT. The black beans are great. Come with fresh cilantro sprig, spicy crema and pico. Don't get me started on the smoked lamb tacos. THEY ARE LIFE CHANGING! Any taco can be made as a bowl and vice versa. They even have walking tacos. you pick the chip, meat and toppings and you're out the door. They keep it real at Doce Taqueria. Real fresh. Real simple. Real quick. No rice. And guac isn't extra....because there isn't any. The place itself is tiny but cozy. The artwork is simple, colorful and eye-catching. It looks exactly how you'd expect it to look. And parking really isn't a problem like I thought it would be. Everyone who works there is great. Friendly. Helpful. Accommodating. Doce has been a blessing for me and many of my taco wackos. Easy to get to. Open late. Always clean. Decent parking. AAAHMAZING food. Great staff. Crazy affordable. Everyday should be Taco Tuesday. ESPECIALLY when there's smoked lamb on the menu for the day!!!",

The menu isn't the only thing that's small here, the dining space is also tiny; I estimate it to seat about 13 people, give or take?  From selecting a few items from the menu, it seemed to me that the toppings for each taco were rather similar, except for their American taco. My carnitas, spicy beef, and nachos were all topped with cilantro and Mexican farmer's cheese, making them look the same. Taste, however, wasn't identical between the three items, but still quite similar. My favorite was the carnitas: very tender and flavorful pork topped with fresh ingredients. What's not to like? The small price tag also makes these tacos even better. At only $3 a taco, you could try one of each without breaking the bank.   Overall, great place to quickly grab some tacos. The service is friendly and super fast. Another perk: they're even open late on weekends!",

I ordered the chicken and carnitas tacos and paid only $6. The menu is super simple which I like, because it makes the decision process much easier. Plus, I'd rather eat at a place that offers few, but high quality items as opposed to a plethora of mediocre items. The fresh ingredients are right there behind the counter as you can watch your meal being prepared. Personally, I found the chicken to have to more flavor so next time I'll go with that. I saw someone else's order of loaded nachos and for about five bucks, they looked hearty and tasty. I'll definitely bring friends back to this place for more good eats. Also, they have vegan and vegetarian options available.!",

They have chicken, beef, carnitas (pork), and veggie options. And they all have fresh toppings with a choice of corn or flour tortillas.  Get. The. Carnitas. They'll make you want to . . . Do-ce-do.  (Corn Torillas all day)  Do they provide authentic Mexican tacos? It feels like it. There are very specific food carts I go to in our city to get the truly authentic Mexican taco experience, but I have to be honest...Doce keeps coming to mind.  I do wonder what happens on the 12th visit.   The inside is small but inviting. Bar-ish style seating. Day of the dead and generally bizarre decor that I like, right off of E Carson.   In the Southside and need a quality bite? Need to move quick? Need to take it to go or to sit in? Need a 12pm lunch spot. I mean...Doce makes it obvious! Eat there.",

There are five kinds of tacos (flour or corn), nachos, and maybe taco salad?  Seating is counter-style, and there are only about nine seats. However, we snagged the last three seats on a Saturday night at 10:45 PM.  I ordered a Carnitas taco on a flour tortilla ($3).

I asked the waitress if my tacos could go light on the mexican slaw when a young chef cheerfully insisted that I should go with the usual amount since it's so good. And omg it was.   The meat was a little dry in my opinion but the lime given along with the slaw added enough moisture to make up for it and the flavors were just mouthwatering.   I ordered 2 tacos but I wish I had the stomach for more. They got nice music in my personal opinion.  They use the electronic-tip choice for when you pay, which I'm not a huge fan of because that's before the experience so how will I know if the food and employees are above and beyond like this!

    "text": "I'm so glad Doce Taqueria is in Pittsburgh! This place has all the elements of a perfect little taco shop. There are Mexican bottled sodas, the tacos are absolutely delicious, they offer black beans and nachos to supplement the few taco varieties, and the price is right! You just can't go wrong with that.   My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Friday around 6:30, and it wasn't too busy. We were able to sit and put in orders immediately. It was fun watching the staff assemble our food, and the ingredients all looked and smelled incredible. One note about the service...I thought everyone was incredibly friendly and responsive, however I can see the staff potentially forgetting or not seeing you right away on a particularly busy night. Nothing to keep me from coming back, however I think I would prefer to come when it's less busy since I need my tacos customized due to my dairy allergy.  Between us we tried the carnitas, chicken, and beef tacos. I inhaled my carnitas and chicken tacos...they were the best I've had in Pittsburgh by far. In addition to beef and carnitas tacos Kyle got an order of nachos. I could only look longingly at them since I can't have cheese. He said they were wonderful. I had a Mexican Squirt with my meal and he had an interesting variety of Mountain Dew. We'll both be getting Squirt next time! It was surprisingly refreshing. I'm planning on coming back to Doce Taqueria sooner rather than later. I want another carnitas taco already!",

Everything was very fresh and we both agreed that the pork tacos are the way to go (much more flavor than the chicken). You MUST try to the black beans! The restaurant is small, so consider ordering to-go if you have a group.  My only complaint is the lack of drink options. They only had a cooler stocked with bottled sodas and iced tea. I would have loved an ice-cold fountain drink to go with my tacos. We even considered going across the street to DQ to grap a diet coke.   Overall, it's definitely something you should try. There's nothing better than fresh, flavorful Mexican food.",

I had the daily special which was a BBQ chicken taco, the carnitas, and the carne molida. My favorite was the special, then the carne molida. Carnitas had a great texture and toppings but I thought the meat itself could have used a little more flavor. The only other thing I would have changed is I prefer fresh jalapeno over pickled, but that's super minor.   The price is right on these tacos for sure! Though I got them to go, the place is very cool inside and the staff is friendly. All in all, I ordered, watched my tacos be prepared, and was on my way in less than 10 minutes! I'm glad I don't live closer because it could be dangerous!",

I would've liked the corn tortillas to have been a little crispier but that's just my preference. They were still delicious! The guac on the chicken taco was so fresh and garlicky. And the cilantro and cojita (I think??) on top of all of them just really made them amazing. The meats were smoky and tender and a little juicy.

    "text": "I must preface that I am from California and my expectations of tacos are high. So with that said, I gave them four stars because because a restaurant is rated on more than food.  The layout of the space is very nice and I love the esthetic. Now let's get to the meat and potatoes...  The best taco that I tried was the pork. The meat was flavorful and the profile of flavors was very nice. I had it on corn and it went well. Their corn shells are a bigger and thicker than most street tacos.  Now, I tried both beef tacos and they were good but not the best I've ever had obviously but for Pittsburgh they are good. Now when I saw beef I immediately think carne asada or something in that range and they just serve regular ground beef. I feel they put to many toppings on the tacos and it gets away from the flavor.  I didn't taste the chicken because I'm not a fan of chicken tacos but according to my boyfriend it was good. Also, I think that trying their tacos on flour may be better but it will be my reasoning for going back.  Overall, I'd patron again but not with the expectations of being blown away but of having a decent taco",

Just because you're cooking \"Mexican\" food doesn't make it okay to mock Mexican people. If you're Latinx, beware before heading in here, it's gonna be awkward.

    "text": "Outstanding Tacos!  After hearing my wife rave about their tacos and nachos for months I had to see what all the hype was about for myself. The inside is fairly small which is a shame as in order to really enjoy their tacos you need to eat them freshly made. Maybe ten seats wrapped around the cooking area and maybe another three or four seats at the window. Lucky for us, the evening we went the place was almost completely empty at the time we arrived but filled up quickly after.  As far as their taco choices go they offer about six different tacos. Carnitas (pork), Pollo (chicken), two types of ground beef tacos (Carne Molida and Americano), a Vegan taco and a Special Daily Taco Special each for $3 each served on either a flour or corn tortilla.   On my first visit I went with a Carnitas, Pollo and Carne Molida taco. The Carnitas taco features slow smoked pork, Mexican Slaw, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Pollo taco features marinated chopped chicken, Avocado, Cholula Crema, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. The Carne Molida taco features Spicy Ground Beef, Bell Peppers, Jalapenos, Cholula Crema, Mexican Farmers Cheese and Cilantro & Lime. Of the three the Carnitas was my favorite by far! The perfectly cooked pulled pork was so flavorful. It was melt in your mouth tender. The Pollo taco was a close second as the marinated chicken was very flavorful as well. The Carne Molida taco was good but not as much of a stand out as the other two.  On my second visit I had the Carnitas Nachos which for $5 is a stellar bargain as I was completely stuffed after I finished them. Some of the best nachos I have had in a long, long time.   I usually don't frequent The South Side or Carson Street very often, but Doce Taqueria will be changing that for sure!",

It's set up like a bar but you have to line up near this register in the corner to order. So it gets very crowded over by the register when it would be easier to just take orders where people sit at the bar. I don't think I'll be stopping in again.",

I walked down to Doce Taqueria.   A small restaurant full of flavor and character.  Their menu is on a chalkboard above where the prepare the food.  They have maybe 8-10 seats in a counter type setting.  The place is awesome.   I watched many patrons come in for to-go orders.  Since I was new, I requested the server to choose my selection of 3 tacos (corn tortilla).  I had a beef, pork, and chicken taco.   The beef and chicken were really good but my favorite was the carnitas (pork).   Not only did the port have great flavor, they put all the accouterments that one could want.  All the ingredients were fresh and the meal had great flavor.  Since they do not serve alcohol - I enjoyed a Mexican soda (Grapefruit) which tasted like a Sprite.  The meal was so good - I order 3 more \"to-go\".  I explained to the server I would need to be wearing my sweat pants for the next 3 tacos ;-).   I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend you stop by and give this a try.",

Sadly this place probably wouldn't make it on the top 5.   The restaurant itself is very cute but also very small. Don't plan on eating here if you have a big group or it's prime lunch/dinner hours. This establishment is more of a order and go place.  As for the tacos they do a specialty taco that changes daily I believe. You can follow their Instagram account to keep up with the daily options. This was probably one of my favorite aspects. Otherwise they just offer a handful of basic tacos that aren't out of the ordinary in any way. The specialty tacos is what makes me want to go back again and again to try the different tacos. I will say I wasn't all that impressed with the flavor of the tacos. I think they lacked flavor.",

They don't sell liquor or beer here, but you are allowed to take it to-go and enjoy it at the bar next door (same owners). Every bite had amazing flavor ... both the tacos and the nachos. I will definitely return very soon. It's a small little place but their concept is very thought out.

If you're lucky enough to live or work nearby you may find yourself here often - I saw a few people picking up tacos to go. I look forward to seeing how their partnership with the bar next door works, too, since they don't serve alcohol.",

I ordered two carnita tacos on flour tortillas but you get the choice of flour or corn tortillas for every taco. The meat was flavorful and well seasoned, the Mexican slaw and fresh pico was also a nice touch. It was garnished with farmers cheese and some cilantro and it was delicious. To make my experience even better, my two tacos were only $6!!! It was an awesome place, with awesome staff, and most importantly awesome food. I will definitely be back!",

The gentlemen working was lovely, walking me through the menu since it had been a while since I'd been there. Tacos come one per order for $3 each. Choose between flour or double corn tortillas. They also have nachos, rice bowl, and walking taco option as well. The vegetarian taco includes house black beans, Pico de Gallo, lettuce, avocado, cilantro, and lime. My oh my, so very impressed with these tacos! The black beans actually had substance and texture, they held up, and you could taste all the various flavors and textures. All the ingredients were SO fresh. The tacos might have looked small but they were chock full of ingredients. Very filling. Tried both the flour and double corn, corn was the favorite. For meat options he first suggested the Carnitas (pulled pork), they smoke it in-house for 12 hours. He also said the Americano (beef) is a crowd favorite. My boyfriend loved the Carnitas, said the Americano was just okay. For four tacos and a water our bill was only $13. Awesome spot for lunch, dinner or late night (open until 3AM on the weekends). Not a full blown restaurant, you order at the counter and they prepare the food behind you. They have just enough seating for probably 10 people max. Awesome food, can't wait to come back for more!",

    "text": "** Pretty good tasting tacos but portions are on the smaller side and the chicken tastes salty. Still prefer Las Palmas in Oakland in my personal opinion, but worth the shot.  Went here for my friends 21st birthday, and I ordered two beef tacos and one chicken, all on flour tortillas. The added guac on the chicken taco definitely caught my eye (as a True California native), and it definitely packed a punch. I do have to say however, that the chicken was pretty salty, and overall I left feeling pretty thirsty. The meat was pretty good as well.  I do have to say that the portions are a bit of a setback. I paid $9 for three tacos, and didn't think it was enough for a whole meal. Luckily, I went to Benny Fierro's for some jumba pizza slices after for that bang bang (a term I learned from another Yelp eliter - funny reacts if you get the reference).   This place is technically a sit down place but you can also get the tacos to go. Seating however is very limited as it is a small restaurant. Personally I like the fact that you can do your own add ons for salsa, cilantro, etc. at Las Palmas, and I definitely think I am a lot more full after eating Las Palmas. However, Doce offers inside seating which Las Palmas doesn't have, and hasn't been shut down for having sanitary issues.",

She had been craving tacos, so asked which proteins I wanted for my two tacos. I chose chicken and pork. It was my first time eating Doce Tacos take out and I was very excited as they have always been delicious on site.   Was it because I was sober that they weren't as good as I remembered them to be? The corn tortilla shells were good, the toppings fresh and flavorful, but both the chicken and pork were dry and not good. The meats were served in nice portions in the tacos , and should have been the star of the show. Sadly, no. I will give them another chance and go back to eat a few tacos after a few strong drinks to see if it helps their review.  I gave them three stars because they have always been good before so I have not written them off.",

While I could be perfectly happy eating the BLT at Piper's on a daily basis (vindaloo bacon! ), there is an endless abundance of restaurants in my neighborhood and it is unfair to eat only at a few choice places.   I hadn't gone to Doce before. It's always pretty busy when I've tried and I can say now that I gave up too easily! My meal was done in 3 minutes and was $8 for 2 tacos and a bottle of water. I got a chicken and a spicy beef. The chicken was pretty good. I'm more of a beef or pork taco girl though. So the spicy beef was my favorite! And really the tortillas were the best part! Fresh, toothsome a grilled perfectly! Some people do not know how important good corn tortillas are! The tacos were really full too! AND because they used the above mentioned quality tortillas, they were formidable enough to handle the filling!  I loved everything! I kind of messed up though! They have specials and there was a chicken taco with a blueberry slaw that i should have opted for! Overall though, loved it and it is a great, cheap option outside of pizza and gyros (lesvos and benny fierro's forever!) when you need something quick and filling!",

    "text": "I came here because a friend recommended me to try the tacos. It was a bit far from where I lived, so I was hesitant to go, but I'm glad that I came. When I first got to the place, I was surprised at how small it was. However, there were a ton of people there.   The decorations were really cool, and the art on the menu contributed to a fantastic ambience. I ordered the spicy beef taco and the regular beef taco ($3 for each), and my friend got loaded nachos. The service was fast (compared to how many people were there). My friend was really happy about the loaded nachos - for $5, she got an incredible amount which would have cost maybe $8-9 at another restaurant.   My tacos came a bit after and I tried the spicy beef one first. My only disappointment was that the spicy beef meant that it was just a regular beef taco with jalapenos in it, whereas I was expecting actual spices in the beef. However, the tacos were really flavorful, and I loved the toppings. The corn tacos were also able to hold all the meat without falling apart - a pretty impressive feat, if you ask me :) And for a price of $3 per taco, it's relatively inexpensive as well.  Overall, I recommend this place and will be back again. To CMU kids - it's kinda far from campus, but it's worth it.",

Boy was that a mistake! I don't think I can say enough wonderful things about the taco I had, but I will try. They had a very small and to the point menu, with one vegetarian option, so that is what I ordered. The tacos were $4 each and absolutely perfectly sized for the price. They don't short you on the filling! Enough filling that I ate it with a fork. You have an option of corn or flour tortillas, which is also excellent. Although I have heard good things about their corn tortillas, I opted for the flour just because I like flour tortillas better. I'm a poser, I know!   The filling for the veg taco was perfectly spicy and all around a really excellent taco. They seem to have a different sort of taco for their restaurant menu as opposed to the food truck menu when it comes to vegetarians/vegans, so I will have to swing by the southside and try it! Definitely recommend!",

I ordered the smoked pulled pork bowl which did not come in a bowl but merely the basket that they serve the tacos in lined with paper. The pulled pork was tender but had no flavor the black beans tasted like they came straight out of the can. There was not one sign of onions or cilantro in the whole dish. It wasn't until I ate the guacamole that some flavor actually came out. Maybe I should have added to guacamole to the entire dish first instead of eating it on the side. I was really looking forward to the pico de gallo being spicy and flavorful but again I was disappointed. If I ever go back to this place I'll be sure to bring my own seasoning's.",

Apparently being the first person to leave a negative review of a 5 star restaurant makes you pretty recognizable.

When I asked for the check I was told my meal was on the house; an effort to compensate me for my negative experience here.

If I was drunk, it would have been flawless. $3 per taco seems a bit steep but they have plenty of hot sauces. I went here two nights in a row since I was staying nearby. Quite a party street but pretty good for drunks.",

I have never had a bad experience here.

    "text": "This place has a cute look and a great local feel with tasty, if Americanized, food.   We stopped by late in the evening on our way to the bar for a quick bite to eat. The trendy concrete bar and the colorful decor gave the small venue a more open and bright atmosphere. The restaurant was super full, which is hard to navigate with the tiny space being essentially a wraparound bar for seating. After a while, though, it cleared out enough for our party to take a seat.   I ordered one chicken and one carnitas taco, and split an order of nachos without meat. It was pretty awesome to see my food be prepared right in front of me as I ordered, and that transparent open concept really works for them. The cooking space was especially tiny and it was interesting to see it all come together with so little to work with. However, from the perspective of an LA native from a full Mexican family, the flavors weren't super spot on.   The carnitas especially tasted like a sweet pulled pork I might expect at a barbecue, instead of fatty and savory carnitas. Certain toppings like cheese and a \"pico\" that was literally just tomatoes made it feel very inauthentic. Still, my food came out quickly and was pretty yummy. I appreciated the tortillas being warmed on the griddle and acquiring a bit of a toast, a touch that's only achieved by using a comal like that. The nachos were very standard but tasty nonetheless.   I saw both the cook and the cashier make friendly conversation with familiar regulars. It really contributed to the cozy, personal vibe of the whole place, without slowing down their service. For a quick fix, we were pretty happy with what we had. But for authentic Mexican flavors, they've got to get out of their comfort zone a little more.",

The good is the pork is absolutely amazing. Don't worry they counter it with a sub-par chicken taco that the chicken is flavorless and just blah.  One critical part about Mexican cooking is the tortilla.   I have been to so many Pittsburgh Mexican restaurants that miss so hard on the tortilla it destroys the dish.  Imagine having a sandwich with white store sandwich bread vs homemade. World of difference, right?  I only did try their chicken and pork. I'm told the beef is also solid and the chicken wasn't a good choice.  If you take just the pork taco and you give them a little room on the tortilla it's so far one of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere screams hipster with the hole in the wall, counter service and little seating. It's a very cozy restaurant and I look forward to trying more options and visiting the new location up North when it opens.",

It is very cramped when you walk in and not much space to eat, but we've been able to find a spot each time we were there. My fiance and I both love the Pollo Taco- he gets it as is, but I just get it with cheese and lettuce and then put their habanero hot sauce on it. The chicken is so tender and delicious! You are able to choose if you want flour or corn tortillas, and are basically able to choose exactly how you want your tacos. Absolutely delicious!!",

I had the Dino bowl which was great.  I got it with the chicken and it had black beans, shredded lettuce, tomato, avocado and some type of dressing I believe.",

There was also some nacho side options I saw. Small inside with limited seated at the bar, maybe around 12 people could sit inside total. No table seating so takeout is a great option. Served quick and out the door in under 5 minutes. I will most certainly be back!",

Their menu is pretty simple... 5 or 6 different types of tacos and all are $3.00 each. I decided to try the pork, chicken and beef!  Each taco was busting with flavor and overflowing with toppings. And they weren't shy with the meat either. $9.00 for 3 tacos and I was completely full. The service is incredibly quick as well. I ordered my tacos and watched them be made behind the bar. They were in front of me less than 2 minutes later. If you are looking for a quick lunch in the South Side, this place will not disappoint.",

Doce taqueria is a small little taco shop with an open kitchen.  Window seating, counter seating and one table outside (holds about ten people total). Fun random decor but they had terrible music blasting the entire time.  Could barely hear anyone.  I ordered two carne molida.  Ground beef, bell peppers, jalapenos.  I left the crema and cheese off.  Decent size I think they were $3 a taco.  All I can say I ehhhhh.  The ground beef was left in big chunks.  Wasn't seasoned very well, quite bland.  They literally just opened a #10 can of generic pickled jalapenos and put them on top.  As a taco place, I feel like you should be pickling your own jalapenos. Super easy and taste way better.  The taco was sogging out.  Tortilla was falling apart.  So much fat dripping off, it caused a substantial puddle in my basket.  They had a large selection of hot sauces but no homemade ones that I saw.  Welp, still on the hunt for some good tacos.",

Being from San Francisco born and raised and Latino at times I've found it difficult to find a place that sells decent tacos and Latin food in PGH.   I'm glad Doce taqueria is in the southside and just a few blocks away from where I stay when I visit. The tacos and beans are legit. I love the fact that they use queso fresco and crema. Staples for Latin food. The chicken and carnitas are on point. The tortillas are great and it's awesome that they give you options of corn or flour. The beans have a nice kick to them and go well paired with a couple tacos.   Most importantly Steve and Carrie who work at Doce are great people who you can tell care about the quality of the food and make sure patrons are doing well.   I'll be back in town soon and looking forward to having a few tacos and chatting with Steve and Carrie again.",

The food was so amazing, I decided that I had to come back when I was sober to make an actual judgement on if it was as delicious as I thought it was.  It was.  This quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on East Carson. I honestly think this taco place beats out the famed Las Palmas, in Oakland, as well as Reyna's in the Strip. The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing.   I think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good. However, my favorites are the pork tacos, and the chicken nachos. The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 a taco, $5 for nachos), and they take cards! They also serve soda in glass bottles, which is nice.   The place is open late on weekends, making it the perfect drunk munchie sort of place.",

I just left, didn't try the food, the wait was pretty long, although there was no line, there was one employee doing everything.

The restaurant is small with s few bar stools at the front window and a few pulled up to the side of the bar. I posted pics so you could get an idea of the decor. It's colorful and lively. They have a big chalkboard that states the tacos they offer. They all looked good but I went for the Americano and the Pollo. They offer flour or corn taco shells. They have a small vintage fridge filled with sodas.  They say the Americano is just like your mom makes. That might be True if your mom is Hispanic. It had seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and cream (sour cream).  The beef was seasoned well and it was a lot of meat for a taco. The shell was soft and all of the flavors melded together. It was one of the best tacos I've had (and I have had many. LOL. The Pollo (chicken) taco had the crumbling Mexican cheese, some avocado, cream along with a lime wedge. The chicken was juicy and the lime juice was perfect. Yum!! Tacos are $3 each.  For four tacos and 2 sodas it was $16. That's a cheap lunch date. That's cheap for tacos that good. They have nachos for $4, add meat and it's $5. They do a great business and are open til 3am on weekends.",

When it comes to tortillas you have two options, flour or corn. My advice is corn...you won't be disappointed.

    "text": "Saw this place pop up while browsing Yelp one day for new eats and decided to swing on by. The joint offers five different premade taco options with fixings made to order: carnitas (pork), pollo (chicken), molida (ground beef), Americano, and vegan, along with a side of beans or nachos as additional paid extras for those wanting a little more to their taco fix. Tacos are $3 each and from what I remember of the sides, I think the beans were $2 and the nachos were $5.  I came and ordered four tacos, one carnitas, one pollo, one molida, and one Americano. Also got them with three corn shells and one flour shell. I will say that I definitely liked the corn shells better ... not as starchy as the flour shell and it has a bit more flavor to it. As for which taco was my favorite? Probably the pork one. The pulled pork in it was tender, juicy, and delicious. The slaw and farmer's cheese in it made each bite all the more tasty. I personally found the chicken to be a bit dry ... might do better for them not to overcook it. The beef one was alright ... it might have tasted better with a bit more cheese in it to offset the acidity that comes from the beef and its juices. Overall I found this place to be a great place to get Mexican tacos ... not sure I'd put them above Las Palmas, but definitely a decent option for those around in South Side!",

    "text": "It's no secret in my Yelp reviews that I LOVE tacos, so when I had been hearing my friends rave about this place for weeks, I knew I had to check it out.  My roommate and I ventured down Carson Street and entered the quaint, colorful restaurant.  A handful of seats are at the cement bar surrounding the taco prep area, and a few more at the window counter.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy, but glad that we were able to grab seats.  I will be honest, I wasn't impressed with the service right off the bat, as it took the two employees working about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing there.  They were working on putting together a couple of orders, but a nod or \"hello\" to acknowledge our presence and impending orders would've been nice.  The gal working finally found a second to take our orders: 3 tacos for me (pork, chicken, and Americano), and 1 taco (pork) and an order of black beans for my roommate.  The tacos came out in a jif, on warm, corn tortillas as requested.  These tacos are the perfect size and good LORD are they delicious.  My favorites, in order, would be the chicken, Americano and pork.  The pork was good, although the slaw that comes on it isn't something I'm a fan of... I'm just not a slaw fan in general so I won't hold that against them.  Doce also offers a cooler full of fun drinks to wash your meal down with, for $2 a pop.  When the check came, I was shocked.  $18. That's it? Should I order more tacos? I mean, EIGHTEEN BUCKS for four tacos, an order of black beans, and two drinks?  I did the math in my head and it checked out.  At $3 a taco, Doce has an advantage over one of my other taco faves in the city, and the location is prime.  I will absolutely be back to this place again and again.  They offer takeout as well!",

I am SUPER glad to see another taco place in the Southside. Considering tacos are one of my FAVORITE things to eat, I was super excited to check it out. The inside is small and super cute and the staff are very friendly.  My boyfriend and I tried their American style taco, another beef one (can't think of the name) and the chicken taco. We both agree that the chicken taco was the best and is now the only one I will order. Don't get me wrong, the beef was not bad- but I have had better. The chicken is packed with fresh flavors like fresh salsa and avocado and is just incredibly tasty. At $3 a taco, this place is a steal.  What's REALLY awesome about this place? They are open late!  It was a Sunday night when we visited again, probably around 9:30 pm. I was starved and couldn't think of what I could eat in Southside besides pizza. We walked past this place and I couldn't believe they were open. My taste buds were really happy.  This place is great. Go there now.",

Me and some girlfriends were here on a Friday night to grab some chow before heading over to a game night. I loved the decor, and the cooks were both very friendly and personable. They had most everything ready to go in steam trays so they can throw together orders quickly, but don't let that deceive you into thinking the food isn't delicious.   We shared some veggie nachos that were delish and only $4 for a big container. I got two pork tacos and one spicy beef. The pork was super legit, moist, and the toppings were the bomb diggity. I also liked the spicy beef, which is interesting because I usually don't go for beef tacos. I was bummed to not see chorizo on the menu, but I was told they have a daily special taco and they sometimes feature the chorizo.   Tacos were $3/per, and drinks from the cooler were all the old school cane sugar ones and Jarritos for only $2 each. This place stays open til 3am on the weekends to accommodate the drunk Southside crowd, and is thankfully NOT cash only.  Great addition to the dope little food joints in the Southside. One of the cooks told me they plan on expanding into the space next door, but I sort of don't want anything to change because it's pretty amazing as is.",

Service was great and their prices are decent so no complaints there. First off their menu is SO small. Only 5 taco choices and only ONE vegan/vegetarian choice. :( I understand having a small menu but only offering 1 vegetarian option alienates a large group of people. Since I'm mostly vegetarian I had to order 2 of the same tacos. Would have been nice to have at least 2 vegetarian taco options and maybe even 1 fish taco option. The veggie tacos weren't bad but extremely plain. I felt they could have been a little more creative with the tacos. I also ordered the nachos. They were not very good. The chips you could tell were an extremely cheap/generic brand same with the melted cheese wiz type cheese. They have the right idea with the toppings on the nachos but need to have better quality chips and cheese.  Will not bother eating at Doce Taqueria again unless they expand their menu, then I will give them a second try.",

We order our tacos on corn tortillas, because that's how the Lord intended tacos to be. Well, guess which ones we received? Not only the disgrace of actually receiving a flour tortilla, but their bathroom was \"unavailable\"? At least have some hand sanitizer at hand if your spot, which serves TACOS, which you happen to eat with YOUR HANDS, has a \"busted bathroom\". Also, be kind enough to at least saying when your bathroom is down where to find an alternative.  Tacos were meh (but this is me comparing to tacos from out of town) and their selection of hot sauces mediocre. Felt like I was in a Chipotle.  Two stars are for decoration.  Obviously now him and I are not friends any longer. Whoever brings you here for tacos doesn't appreciate you and you shouldn't have them in your life.",

My favorite taco is hands down the chicken- it's just sooo darn good. Juicy chicken, refreshing creama and avocado, mmmm. I also love the pulled pork taco and usually find myself going for their daily special. Today it was Korean bbq chicken- it was what I can only describe as transcendent. The loaded nachos are always a hit and super filling. I tried a Dino bowl for the first time today- courtesy of the owner. It was super filling and delicious. A great and healthy option that makes you forget you're getting a huge helping of veggies and protein. The hospitality on top of the delicious food simply can't be beat. Any time I'm drinking in or near the south side, I think I look forward to the late night tacos more than the drinks. I also love Doce because I never feel guilty about stuffing myself full- the ingredients are truly so fresh and good for you that even those who \"watch what they eat\" can feel good about a meal here.

The tortillas are also freshly made and are perfectly prepared every time.   If you're looking for a place to grab some fast and tasty tacos, this is your spot.",

You won't even mind the lack of octopus or duck confit, promise. The short but solid menu is well thought out and includes a daily special for those who shun conformity.   These are exceptional tacos for the price. And the people who work here are cool as a cucumber (topped with fresa cheese, for good measure.)",

I ordered the pollo and carne molida tacos (chicken and beef) on corn tortillas and they were absolutely delicious.   There was only one person working when we ordered, so we waited about 10 minutes for our tacos from the time we arrived. The chef was quick and would often fill three orders at once. With a steady flow of customers, I thought his timeliness was quite impressive. No one was left waiting for long at all.  If you're looking to order the daily special, they ran out around 6 PM even though this taco shop is open until midnight during most week days.  I will definitely be returning, and I recommend this spot to anyone looking for delicious tacos around Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "It took me forever to get here having gotten distracted when it first opened by spending the summer in Boston [sigh - I missed so much this Pgh Foodie Summer], so my friend C beat me to the punch and designated this 'Taco Taco - the Taco place'. It's pretty awesome and a fantastic addition to the South Side and Pittsburgh.  The inside is small and simple with a counter and bunch of built-in barstools surrounding the Taco making station. It seats about 10 at the bar and another 3-4 at the window looking out on a busy carson street. The board is straightforward on the selection of 5 tacos. They are nicely sized and extremely juicy and the aroma is just amazing out the door, pretty much literally. Especially for the fantastic price of $3/taco.   Yum, by far, my favorite is the Carnitas [Pork], followed by the Chicken, then the Carne Molida [ground beef]. I haven't gotten to the rest yet, but I'm sure that will happen sooner than later. Also I'm totally digging the Mexican artistic style of the chalk board.   All together, love it and hope it sticks around for a long time. Last piece of advice, either come hungry or leave as soon as you're done. As you are immediately next to the food prepping, the aroma is constantly up in your face, and those who linger will end up eating and eating until you're through the entire menu. Gotta love it.",

As it was my first time at the taqueria, I asked what the recommended. The others at the bar suggested I try both a corn and flour tortilla so that I get the best of both worlds. I chose the vegetarian (black bean) and chicken tacos.  The tacos were ready in a flash and came topped with cheese and a lime on the side. The tacos were both delicious and I think that the black bean was my favorite. Both weren't as flavorful as I would have imagined, I was expecting more of a punch, but you could tell that the quality was there.  This place is pretty small and only seats up to maybe 8 or so at time, so if you're looking for a late night snack, definitely grab and go!",

Tacos are $3 a piece, drinks are $2 (oh, and no fancy pants cocktails here ... just sodas--all made with cane sugar--and water). And folks, it'll be the best $10-$15 you ever spend on tacos.   There are 5 choices: carnitas (pork), chicken, spicy beef, American (read: NOT spicy) beef, and vegan. Dear GOD, are these tacos good. We (my adventurous eating kids and I) had an assortment, but agreed that the carnitas was far and away the best. We also had some refried bean dip, hot and steaming and yummy on a cold fall day, to mix things up a bit.   There are just a few stools to sit on around the counter, and the folks who create this delicious goodness are friendly and chatty (and who totally indulged my daughters games and party tricks, which are endless).  Super solid choice of yum in the South Side (I want to go back today!)",
