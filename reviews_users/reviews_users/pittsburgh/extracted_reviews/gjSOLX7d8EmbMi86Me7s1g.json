Also they have a beer called Sprecher, Hard root beer, And it tastes  just like Root Beer, awesome. There is also an Upstairs for extra room and a great View.",

I've swung by this place several times for lunch and drinks, and it's just never done it for me. It might have something to do with the decor. The interior seems very dark walking in, and not as welcoming as you think. The bar downstairs is filled with high tables, and it seems to be empty, or filled to the brim every time I go visit.   While The Beerhive has an above decent draft selection, I'm not drawn to much beyond that. The food is lackluster. On my last visit, I order the Buffalo Blue sandwich, and lost interest less than a quarter of the way in. The chicken was dry, and the flavors seemed off kilter. I did have a decent draft, but lots of bars get their beer list right.   The only thing that keeps me coming back to The Beerhive is convince from the office. I love a good pun, but I can't say I love it here.",

She was very nice to talk to and invited us to visit her at work, she was headed in for her shift. So we did! Amy and carol took care of me and my husband. They let us sample two beers, and we picked a growler from that. They were both so nice and provided such great service. As a service industry couple, we appreciate friendly bartenders that know their stuff. We didn't eat, but they spoke highly of the food. We will definitely be back, and you can thank Amy and carol for that!",

In keeping with the seasonal theme, I ordered the Southern Tier Pumpking Ale.  Delish, as always. They have about 12 or so beers on tap that's clearly written up on a big chalkboard above the bar.  I'm into bars that have a wide variety on tap.  I can't stand when you go somewhere and all they have is Miller and Coors Light.  But for a name like the BeerHive, they really should have more to offer!  They also have a big refrigerator with a whole lotta specialty beers to pick from.  You can either pick up a beer and drink it there or take out for a \"night cap\" at home.    For \"bar food\" the food is pretty decent!  Sticking with the hive part of beer they have a lot of honey type concoctions.  We opted to try a couple wing flavors, as they all looked pretty yummy.  We tried the salt n' vinegar, honey bbq, ranch and buffalo.  I really enjoyed the salt n' vinegar, being a huge vinegar fan!  I also thought the honey bbq was pretty good.  We also ordered I REALLY enjoyed the honey bites, mini cinnamon pretzels with honey drizzled on top.  YUM-O!   They have a lot of different specials, including $1 off beers and $3 apps.  The HH special for beers isn't too great, but I love a good deal on food too, so it balances out!  They also have a special armature comedy night.  I think that would be an interesting thing to see, laugh at them or laugh with them?  We'll see!",

    "text": "Anyone that's been to the Strip District on a beautiful Saturday morning in Pittsburgh knows that Penn Ave can be quite chaotic between all the cars and mass of people weaving in and out of the streets. My girl and I come to the strip often to get our groceries and putz around looking for side street attractions and food vendors to nibble on as we jaunt around.  10am and feeling the need for a cold draft beer for some reason...No I am not an Alcoholic haha, we stumbled into The Beerhive. I've walked by the place a hundred times before, but the fact that I could get a cold draft beer at 10am sounded pretty refreshing to me instead of my regular cup of joe.   The place is very warm and welcoming. I felt like I could of spent all day here just relaxing sipping on some Yingz and talking to the other friendlies at the bar watching some sports on a handful of TVs in the place.   They offer a Saturday Morning breakfast menu till noon with a half dozen or so breakfast sandwiches or so. I got an egg sand which with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and spicy mayo all between two pieces of Italian toast accompanied with greasy home-fries and peppers. Tasted amazing with the Yuengling draft.   My girl was a little disappointed that they only served breakfast at this time till noon when she had picked out an appetizer and a burger from menu and was told they couldn't make her selections at this time of the day so I split my sandwich with her and she really enjoyed it as well.  The Beerhive is not a world changing place, think more blue collar sports bar and welcoming. It did have a good breakfast sandwich and a dozen or so other beers and IPA's on draft that I'd like to come back and try in the future. It also does have a full liquor bar, but I dont think I'd come here asking for a speciality cocktail or anything like that even though they did have a few spiked morning beverages like a Mimosa, Bloody Mary on their breakfast menu...I think I'll also try stopping by one evening and seeing what the nightly crowd is like and try something off their evening menu. Next time I'm in the strip though on a Saturday morning I think I'll definitely be stopping back for a greasy breakfast sandwich and a cold brew! Maybe I'll see yinz there?  May your drink always stay cold! Yours truly...The Shaw",

Aside from pleasant conversations with lovely barmaids, one can have his or herself a very capable French-style, double-patty, 1/4 pound burger in 9 clever variations.   Before catching Kreator and Overkill at Altar Bar, I was scanning The Strip District and realized I had never been to Beerhive. Since I'm eternally chasing fresh Yelp material, I decided to spin the wheel.   I made it clear to the alluring, tastefully-inked blonde woman behind the counter that I was hungry and had a concert to attend. She smiled, sliding a menu in front of me, seemingly relieved that I wasn't going to be an obnoxious, drunken lecher who would creep around for too long.   Confessing just a minute before that Poison and Bon Jovi are as hard-hitting as it gets for her, she asked innocently, \"Does that music, that heavy metal, does it get you charged and pumped up?\"   \"Absolutely,\" I answered with a glint in my eyes.   So did the Maple Bacon Burger. Served with exactly what its title suggests, I added bacon, cheddar, l-t-o, mayonnaise, and a fried egg to the setlist and came out with something that nourished me throughout the raging, strident, technically masterful aggrofest that went down that evening. Syrup tangled with the juices of the savory beef while the over-hard egg truly turned night and day and dinner and breakfast upside down and inside out. Replacing the fine bun with pancakes and the chips with homefries was the only thing left to do to make this sunrise-after-sunset meal completely \"first watch\" material. A helping of ideally crunchy housemade potato chips and a smash of a sweet pickle complimented the burger agreeably. The latter, a wet obelisk of cured cucumber, had herbs stuck to it and came from a place called the Pittsburgh Pickle Company.   \"Have fun, and be safe. I hope your show rocks,\" the Angel of the Mead said to me as I settled up.   \"Oh I will, and it will,\" I told her, grinning. What this innocent lass didn't know...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4Ycb5S2kqPs&s=e5cc05712cfa29936f3567d5c3979b9b3623b5767f31127bd63481ab77d046ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=4Ycb...</a>",

We were here for a private yelp event but did get to enjoy the bar afterwards.   They hold a trivia night every friday and I believe we went on a wednesday when they had stand-up mic night. All the tables and bar were filled but we managed to squeeze in at a table with some strangers. They were nice enough to share especially since they were at a 4 seated table and it was only the two of them. We ordered wings that night since they were half off. They were great too, awesome sauce choices and they weren't dry at all. It did take them a while to get cooked though, like 20 minutes which i thought was long for wings. I figured it was because of the crowd that they were a little slow. They have a unique menu here with foods I've never known like Seitan. It's some kind of bread sponge material, idk but i had it on a taco and it was pretty amazing.   We stayed for about an hour listening to some stand up comedians which were decent. It was my first time getting to see improv comedy from local artist. And there was no charge for this event either which was pretty awesome. I like that they have cool events they put together that make your experience here better than just an average bar hop.   Good fun, nice people, service was ok and of course, planned entertainment!!",

Pittsburgh is definitely not as advanced as Cbus with the microbreweries but the Beerhive has a great selection of beer on draft and in bottle.  I tried the fried pickles which are made with Pickles from the Pittsburgh Pickle Company, which I was told is also the same owners at the Beerhive.  The pickles were fantastic!  The breading was amazing as well as the dipping sauce!  We also stopped back on the way out of town to buy a few jars of the pickles...affordable and delicious!  Service was also excellent!",

The atmosphere wasn't great either - you could tell that there were some locals who hung out in there all the time, and we were definitely outsiders. We might try it again since our friends are moving right down the street, but we'd explore other options first before going back.",

So I expected a little bit cheaper beers. The food -- It smelled good but only about 1/3 of my sweet potato fries were edible.

    "text": "My friends and I have been going The BeerHive for months now for trivia and I must say I could not be more disappointed in the waitress we have consistently had. We've always enjoyed the food, the trivia, and the overall atmosphere, but the waitresses (with one in particular) consistently have terrible attitude and truly should not be working in the food service if they hate interacting with other humans. This one waitress is extremely neglectful, even if it wasn't a busy night, and often overcharged us or straight up added things to our checks that we never ordered. Whenever we'd point out these issues, she was extremely rude about fixing HER mistakes and would take forever to get us our correct checks. Last week, this waitress had the nerve to accuse us of dining and dashing when only two members of our large party had to leave early after waiting FOREVER for this waitress to come with their checks. Finally, because they needed to leave, they asked other people at our table to cover their checks. This waitress then went on a RANT, claiming that we never tip her (we ALWAYS over tip her and, lest we forget, she likes to over charge) and that this is the second week she's been stiffed (we haven't been to trivia for a couple weeks when this happened). I understand a waitress's job is stressful and they're very underpaid; however there's no reason to take your frustration out on regular customers who are always overly generous (and who are also all students- we can't shell out exactly how she'd like, SO SORRY). We liked the BeerHive and it was a great weekly spot for trivia but after this experience, we will certainly find another spot.   ****P.S. I made the mistake of returning to the BeerHive with a different group of friends when we were crunched for time and needed to eat fast. The two bartenders were drinking on the job, ignore me for ten minutes before finally coming over to me at the bar to order food (they refused to come to our table to take our orders), and gave 4/8 of our group the wrong meal. The establishment could be really great but the service is absolutely terrible. They need an entirely new staff if I would ever reconsider coming back.",

I got the chicken and waffles and it was definitely different than what I expected with the waffle cut up on one side of the dish and the chicken tender strips on the other side.   The chicken was good and I enjoyed the breading to it. It wasn't good enough that I'd go out of my way to get again, but good enough that if I'm the area I'd get again. The waffles were average- which isn't a bad thing. The flavors of the syrup and dipping sauce were excellent and one of the more memorable parts of the meal.  The only thing that I would call negative is the bacon. It was soft and crumbled, and the taste matched the appearance. I normally love bacon and I was only able to eat one piece because of the slightly weird taste to it.  I'll give it 3 stars for the food. Not bad, not great, but a place I would return to if I'm in the area and hungry.",

It comes with two 1/4 patties handled minimally, so you can taste the beef and cooked magnificently on super high heat to form a crunchy crust without overlooking the middle. The bun, cheese, lettuce and tomato were all on point as well. I had French fries as my side for an extra $1. They were fresh cut fries with sea salt and herbs. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle (thank god).   Other people at my table had the Belt sandwich, chicken wings and full-on fries. The cheese on the fries was way better than expected, a smoked cheddar sauce. We had no complaints about anything.  Service was friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back often.",

Love their maple bacon and lime cilantro flavors the best and they make their own dill ranch...stuff friggin is awesome.",

Everyone I came with loved their food. I got the pork tacos and they were very very good. We also got the chicken nachos as an appetizer and they were amazing. All the ingredients on the nachos were fresh. The lighting was a little dim so it was hard to read the menu. It was super packed but we were able to find seats on the second floor. They only had one girl working the bar and all the tables on the second floor so service was a little slow at first. Pricing of the food was very reasonable. I will definitely be going back to the beerhive in the near future.",

We're a group of craft beer enthusiest who get together once a month and we each bring a beer that, hopefully, no one has tried before (that's the challenge, finding one during the weeks leading up to our MeetUp).   We alternate between two establishments and tonight it was the BeerHive. As always, the waitstaff was extremely courteous and attententive, the beer list is impressive, and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean.  I like it here.   Since we always meet on a Tuesday, I always get the Taco Tuesday Special when I'm here -- four beef taco's.  Don't think Taco Bell, these tacos have dressed to please.  I never walk away hungry.    If you're in the Strip and looking for a good beer joint with good food I would highly recommend the BeerHive.",

It is very clean and welcoming. They have an excellent variety of beers and liquors for a great price. The bartender was extremely nice and attentive. They were raffling off a pretty nice Yuengling cooler if you bought a Yuengling. I didn't win, but I thought it was really cool that they were doing that.  I definitely want to come back here- it's small, inviting, and not overpriced!",

There wasn't any music or anything playing either so it was awkwardly quiet for parts of the night.   The beer selection was decent. They didn't have many options on draft but at least everything they had was of pretty good variety. I was expecting more based on the name of the place..  The food was probably the highlight of the experience. The burgers were excellent and cooked perfectly, while at a very fair price. The Pittsburgh Pickle Company pickle on the side was a solid bonus.   I felt like the bartender was pretty stand-offish and definitely did not want to be there. I noticed she was very unpleasant with every single person in the bar, including myself, so that was kind of a downer.  Overall, a decent spot if you're nearby.. but not the craft beer hot spot I was expecting by the name.",

Nice big bar, attentive bartender and good atmosphere.   Then I checked the 12 tap list. My expectations weren't exactly realized here. Of the 12 taps, 3 were ciders and 1 was Yuengling. I actually understand you have Yuengling on tap during Stanley Cup Playoff Hockey, so they get a free pass on that one. The 3 Ciders - I could see 1, definitely not 3. It's a craft beer bar. The only IPA on their list was a Blood Orange one. They had 2 pale ales and I tried one of those. It was ok. My husband got the only IPA. I tried that, too. Neither beer would be on my list for a 2nd. They have bottles & cans  but I have those at home.   I expected a bar with some similarities to Independent Brewing. It's looks like that's what they're trying to achieve but for now it's just ok.",

Now I'm not much of a beer drinker and prefer vodka or rum based mixed drinks. The bartender seemed quite clueless when I asked her to make me something with one of the flavored vodkas they had on their shelves. She had 0 ideas until I suggested a plain old vodka-soda. For everyone who comes here for beer, which is most people.. The BeerHive doesn't disappoint with all of its options! Even the food menu is quite extensive with plenty of vegetarian options. I quite enjoyed my fried pickles. I just wish they'd give me a decent mixed drink option and I'll visit again!",

Don't just come here for the excellent craft beer- Come for the best food in The Strip!   The beer selection at the Beer Hive is the best in the Strip. I love East End Brewery, but Beer Hive represents from local to Pacific Northwest. Beer Hive has good food! Burgers, wings, Pittsburgh Pickles. It is bar food, not \"gastropub\",  just damn good bar food. The servers do not fawn over you. They are kind of introverted. This bothered me at first. Then I started to get to know them (I've been coming here 3 months and I am also introverted), they like beer! They are actually cool! They are young. I am old. I think we will be friends some day.",

The bartender initially asked if we'd be needing food menus, and after we said 'no, just a beer for now', it took her another ~10mins to circle back and ask for our order. Seemed like a bit too long given she didn't seem to be filling other drinks at the time, and it wasn't very busy.  But still, once we got our beer it was very good. They have a decent selection of draft beers.   TLDR; Not a bad spot to pop in for a drink or two.",

It has a cozy interior, friendly bar tenders, and a great location in The Strip District. The drink selection is wide, but not overwhelming. For those who like signature drinks, they have a fridge of unique IPAs that have a fair price tag. Same with the food. There's a menu that would complement anyone's preference. Everything tasted great too! The Happy Hours and Trivia nights are so much fun and have excellent deals! Also, trivia nights have a stellar DJ with an impeccable taste in music.

While the staff is generally pretty friendly, the service is variable at times, especially when you're on the second floor. The place gets pretty loud so beware if you're with someone isn't about that. They always seem to have a decent draft list that is ever-changing. The food is definitely a few steps above your typical bar food but not by much. I recommend their tacos, specifically their fish tacos.

I had a veggie seitan sandwich in a pita with fries. It did take a considerably long time to get our food, almost taking up our lunch hour so we scarfed it down when it came out.   My sandwich was huge. The only issue I had was that the seitan was too hard. I think it was over-cooked as was everyone else's waffles and my fries.

I was looking for a little refuge from the crowds, heat, and more so some cold beers that weren't event priced.  Well with a name like Beerhive, one would certainly expect an ample beer list full of choices.  Nah.  For starters I don't know if the bartender was having a bad day or was just overly unfriendly.  We aren't the type to snap our fingers or wave our hands for service but she sure treated us like we were bothering her.  As mentioned this \"beerhive\" was more of a \"Beer-hemmed in\".  I don't consider 12 taps special.  Especially if two to three of them contain commercial beer and cider.  I guess the list of bottles was more extensive but I like a draft when I go out for a beer.    As noted the bartender, very unfriendly.  It really wasn't even busy.  I honestly don't think she spoke more than a few words to us.  I asked for a couple waters when we ordered.  Our drinks delivered, she never spoke.  I waited and it became obvious she \"forgot\" so I asked again.  No apology or oh yea no problem.  More of a roll her eyes and slap some water down.  She only gave us a clear plastic cup, and though it was nice and cold I was thirsty from the heat outside and drank it fast.  When I asked for more water I was again ignored for at least my first two requests.    We decided to leave after just one.  Sorry nothing special here, and I don't really like my beer served with a side of salty.",

The bar menu has some good sounding selections that I'd like to revisit.  I wasn't thrilled with the flavor of the maple-bacon wings (basically just topped with maple syrup and bacon crumbles), but the size and consistency of the wings were great.  Worth stopping in if you're in the area.",

    "text": "I had an overall good first experience at BeerHive. The food was much better than I would have expected for \"bar food.\" I ordered the chicken fingers and they had a delicious sweet potato breading- amazing! My friend tried a burger and also had nothing but good things to say about it. Fries were ok, nothing special. Fairly limited menu, but everything we ordered was good. The on tap beer selection was nothing to rave about, which I found surprising for a specialty beer bar. I would have expected more than 8-10 beers on tap. It was a good variety of more unusual beers, however. My main complaint was that the type of beer (ie. wheat, stout, IPA) was not listed anywhere. Our waitress was new, so she was unable to answer any of our questions about the beer selection. They did seem to have an extensive bottle beer selection, however. Ambience: average. It looks like a typical sports bar. The downstairs bar area is fairly small with only a few tables and a counter along the wall, but there is additional seating upstairs. Menus were shabby looking and could definitely use a makeover. The restaurant itself was clean, at least. Local artwork on walls for purchase. Service: somewhat slow, as I would expect for a new establishment. It took a while for the bartenders and waitress to notice us, even though it wasn't at all busy. Once we ordered, it was quick. We had to ask for glasses- our beers were handed to us in bottles, which seemed weird for a \"beer\" bar. I would come back again for a drink and a meal, but I wouldn't recommend it to any beer connoisseurs. There are other bars with a more extensive draft list catering to that crowd. Might be a good place to watch sports. There was a Steelers preseason game on TV as we were leaving and most of the people in the bar were there to watch it (complete with yelling at the TV). Prices were very reasonable.",

    "text": "Very disappointing. Was in Pittsburgh over the weekend...there was a chalkboard sign in front of the Beerhive promoting their Blood Marys. I love a good bloody mary, so I was excited to go in. The place apparently did not open for another hour---so I am not sure why they had the sign out already. But we figured we would come back since we were shoppping in the area. WORST. BLOODY. MARY. EVER. A tiny glass of crap. We asked for hot sauce, horseradish, pepper, pickles anything to doctor this up...but you couldn't make this better. Friends got some food and it was also very bad...service wasn't great either. But at least I could talk to my friends, oh wait, after about 20 minutes, they decided to turn on the radio extremely loud. So much for talking...it was only 11:30 in the morning on a Sunday. I do not recommend this place.",

    "text": "I don't understand the positive reviews on this place; I'm even being a little generous. I just moved to Pittsburgh in November, from D.C., and I'm going to start getting into this Yelp thing. I live pretty close to the Beerhive, and it was my first Pittsburgh bar experience. I don't know if it's a Pittsburgh thing, but why are bars here all so similar. It's pretty boring, bland, and drab little dive. Granted, we were there in the afternoon, and the place was empty, but it's just so dreary inside.  Sure, dive bars probably don't have the budget or necessity to hire a decorator, but man, this place looks pretty DIY. Black walls, bad call. And the artwork chosen to adorn the walls doesn't make any sense. Sports bar? Bottle Shop? Pub? Another reviewer said that the place was hip, and that's crazy talk. If that's hip, then my ten year old, stained t-shirts must be pretty chic. The name Beerhive gave me a good chuckle though, that's pretty cheesy, but maybe that's what they're going for. And a note, beerhive was a beer produced by New Holland Brewing, a few years ago, so let's just hope that they don't have a TM on that. Maybe I'm being nit-picky, but we should have just walked on by, but my wife was curious, so we gave it a shot.   I'm something of a beer geek, and for a place with the word beer in it's name, well, the selection was underwhelming. Only like ten drafts, and all way too similar, and the bottle selection was pretty standard stuff, nothing really rare or worth going out of your way for. Decent pricing, that's a plus. I was kind of hungry, but was pretty worried about getting some low-grade bar food, but I checked the menu anyway.  Pretty standard, I guess, for bars around here, but I can't say that I expected much from the place. Gastropubs are popping up all over D.C., and that's a trend that I wholly embrace. Rather, it was a menu of mostly deep-fried stuff, and a pretty poor selection. And not to be an ass, but the description of the food was very, I don't know, silly. Our server mentioned that the place was pretty new, and owned by three brothers, and it's clear that this is their first go at this.  I opted for the pulled pork, and my wife had the spinach salad. My pulled pork was actually pretty good, better than I expected, and well seasoned, and it was served with (not fresh cut) fries, and actually some of the best cole slaw I've ever had. It wasn't the mayo-ey variety, which I don't care for, but rather in some sort of vinagrette. The sandwich was a little light on the bbq, but the house-made pickles were a nice touch. The fries tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in quite some time. My wife enjoyed her salad. It came dressed in a ginger-honey dressing, had apples and tomatoes on top and grated parmasean cheese. All in all, pretty decent food - better than expected - a pleasant surprise. But on to the reason I'm writing this review:  A few weeks ago, I was walking through the strip with a co-worker, and he wanted to stop in the Beerhive to get a six pack to go. The bartender told us that if we didn't want our beers cold, we could pick stuff from their beer selection upstairs.  Everything was stored in a weird little, dark closet. I was perplexed as most places would only store premium beers that can actually be bottle aged, so it was strange to see so many beers that cannot be bottle aged.  It just doesn't make sense.  But the prices were pretty good. And I must mention, again, the artwork on the walls, oh my, what were they thinking. I didn't plan on eating, but my buddy wanted to get a little something before we left. I told him that their pulled pork was pretty good, and I was just going to get a few wings to snack on.   I gotta say, it was a very different experience from my first time there. My buddy did order the pulled pork, I ordered a half-dozen spicy asian wings. Again, the place was practally empty, but our food took well over 20 minutes to arrive. My wings were good, but I must say, the names of their sauces were pretty silly. All bee themed, which is cute to some, but if you are the Beerhive, then is it not beer in the hive and not bees; I don't know. Anyway, my friend's pulled pork looked like it was slopped on the plate, which was kind of dirty. And he handed me a fork-full of the pork, and it was dry, kind of charred, and underseasoned. He doesn't care for cabbage, so I helped myself to the slaw, and it just tasted like cabbage in some watery, tasteless liquid.  Consistency people. Sorry, Beerhive, but you've got some work to do. I'd stop in again to buy a sixer, but I would never hang out there, or recommend it. There's really no reason to go out of your way, or to go at all, unless you go in expecting very little. I'd redecorate, scrap the food, or go in a different direction with it.  My next review will be Kaya, after I go again; I really like that place. The best part: when I walk past the beerhive, then I know that Kaya's just a block away. -Lee McDonald",

What first brought me in the door a couple of years ago was the name. Honestly I did the quick glance and thought it said Beehive and it reminded me of the coffee shop that used to be in oakland during my college years so I walked in. Only after entering did I realize it said beerhive-very clever. They have a sweet draft selection-lots of good crafts on tap and they rotate fairly often. There are plenty of tvs at the bar too in order to watch whatever game you want to view. I've never had a problem grabbing some seats at the bar, but there are also some tables if that is your preference. Service has always been friendly and efficient. I have yet to eat here in all the years I've been coming to the Beerhive (usually because I'm full from getting my edgar's taco fix) but everything I have seen people order-particularly the wings and burgers-looks and smells amazing. I'd recommend stopping in for at least a beer and to rest your legs after walking the strip.",

The menu is appz, wingz, burgerz, sandiwichez, you get the deal. Prices are reasonable to moderately expensive.  My jalapeno cheddar burger was ok. Tending towards overcooked even though ordered medium, the patty was thin and chewy. The bun would have been great if not maybe a day past it's prime. The slaw was the best thing on the plate.  Service gets 3 stars. The servers were friendly enough and easy to work with, but my food took a solid 20 minutes and I was one of 3 people in the place at 5:00 on a saturday.

We were also super impressed with the appetizers, which take your standard bar fare up a few notches. The lettuce wraps were pretty tasty and the wings.....killer! I am dying to try the soft pretzel appetizer next time. I am a sucker for a good soft pretzel.   Only complaint- the ladies room. There is one stall and a swinging door that only covers you midsection when you pee. Thank goodness I am a short gal. The door doesn't lock well so ladies, be prepared.

Beerhive looked like the perfect solution and overall it satisfied my needs.   Beerhive is a small hole in the wall joint with a decent beer selection and your standard bar food options. I don't remember which draft beers I had, but I enjoyed them. Looked like a good bottle selection as well. Went with cheese sticks and chicken tenders for food. Neither was outstanding but it tasted better than typical bar food. The chicken tenders had a pretty unique breading which I liked. The cheese sticks come with a spicy marinara sauce. There was only one waitress/bartender working, she was nice and did a good job of checking back with us.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, the Beerhive isn't a place that I would go out of my way for, but if you are visiting the Strip District and are looking for a bite or a drink, its a good place to stop in.",

We arrived about 5:40p, just ahead of everyone else fortunately.  Got one of the tables on the main floor and our waitress promptly stopped over with menus and requests for drinks.  There was a nice chalkboard full of the craft brews on tap but I wanted to see how the staff would handle suggestions.  Without just touting a selected brew our waitress skillfully asked about preferences and current likes/dislikes.  She then made a couple of suggestions which really hit the mark.  I had an Atwater Conniption Fit, double IPA which was very good.  My son had a Draai Laag Aureus which he enjoyed.  We ordered Pretzel apps that came with a nice house made honey mustard dip.  For dinner my son had the BELT, Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato which was quite tasty and I had the pulled pork Taquitos.  Great sauces and flavor.  The atmosphere was excellent for an after work hang out and grabbing a bite to eat.  Plenty of screens to watch multiple events and a good, up to date juke.  I look forward to hitting this spot again.",

Needless to say the day turned into a Sunday Funday when we stumbled upon this little gem.  It was the coldest day of the year so far and there weren't too many brave soles out in the Strip, but this place had an in and out crowd.  The place has nice decor and a good beer selection, with about a dozen draft beers.  The was a young lady and gentleman working the bar and few tables and both were very knowledgeable about their beers, very attentive to the costumer, and were also good company.  I can't say too much about the food, except the two flavors of wings we had were pretty good.  One was a hot wing flavor with jalapeno puree, and the other was a maple bacon flavor.  The maple bacon was good, but not great.  It could have been great with a little more bacon, or a better way to keep the bacon sticking to the wing.   We also had a side of french fries.  They are the crispy batter dipped kid that are one of my favorites, but these were a little soggy (still decent though).  They also give you the choice of old bay seasoning, ranch seasoning, or seasoned salt for an extra 50 cents.  50 cents is a rip off, but I sure do love old bay on my fries so I couldn't pass it up.",

    "text": "You can bacon-infuse any burger on the menu, where they add freshly ground bacon right into the ground beef before they form the burger. EXCELLENT. They only cook them one way and you have to pay $1 extra for fries instead of chips. The food Is good enough to get 3 and a half stars but their extravagant beer menu pushes it up to 4. Seems like a great place to grab some above average bar food and catch a game. I would def come here again",

    "text": "I like the name, and the location is in an accessible part of the strip.  Truthfully, this place is 3* right now because there's not much to make it \"stand out,\" but based on my talks with the owner, they'll be a 4 or 5 star establishment in no time.  They have a good beer selection.  Not a ton of crazy beers, but there's more than enough to appeal to your average good beer drinker.  It's nowhere near Fatheads, Rolands, or Smoking Joes, though, and not many seasonals.  They also sell growlers.    The food selection is bar-type food, and I didn't have a chance to try it, but it was an interesting menu.  They have a solid list of unique wing flavors, and a few other items that will have me go back.  Prices are affordable, and there are plenty of TVs for sports.  So, the reason for the 4 stars...after talking with the owner, they have some ambitious plans that I really like.  One...they want to start a Bloody Mary bar, and they have the perfect space for it.  Two...they're going to start breakfast/brunch, with chicken & waffles and \"upscale\" breakfast food.  Three...they're going to start carrying unique firkins, as well as consider beer cocktails.   If any of these things happen, it'll become a great place to visit in the strip.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were walking down the strip on a Saturday for a place to enjoy a light lunch and some beer and we stumbled on a sign that said \"BEERHIVE LET IT BEER: BEATLES AND BEER ALL DAY\".  We instantly walked in and were greeted right away with fantastic, knowledgeable service and great food.    There was an aged-Southern Tier Pumking on tap (in March) that was phenomenal and a blueberry bottled beer from Blue Dog Brewing that our bartender (who ended up being the owner to our surprise) suggested and we thoroughly enjoyed it.   I suggest this bar to anyone that is looking for a laid-back setting with great product and non-snob knowledge.  The perfect place to stop while shopping in the strip!",
