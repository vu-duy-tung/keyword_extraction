    "text": "A horrible way to spend your Valentines Day. Let me start by saying that I used to be a waitress at a very nice restaurant in Indiana, Pa, so I KNOW how it can be on Valentine's Day and other busy evenings...It was our first time here, and definitely our last. When we walked in, we thought the restaurant was very cute, and we were excited to be seated. A few minutes later, we were acknowledged and sat. Our waiter came to greet us, tell us about the specials, and also warned us that since the meals were all made in house, that it takes longer than expected. He suggested we ordered appetizers to hold us over. We ordered calamari, dates, and short ribs, as well as our meals which we both chose duck. 10 minutes later our waiter comes back to inform us that they were out of duck. No problem- we ordered the wild boar and a veal dish, as well as some cocktails. Our waiter then brought us bread which was cold and hard. After an hour and a half without being brought our appetizers, I asked the waiter how much longer it would be. He didn't apologize or answer my question, instead, said \"waiting on the kitchen\". I thought it was time to talk to the manager/owner, whoever she was. She came over to the table and I explained that we ordered 3 appetizers because we knew the meals would be awhile, but an hour and a half for appetizers to come out was inexcusable. She agreed, and said they would be out soon. She didn't apologize, or try to please us by offering drinks, a free appetizer, etc. About 10 minutes later, our waiter finally brought our appetizers. Again, no apology. The dates were terrible. The short ribs were very good, and the calamari had NO lemon caper sauce on them, as the menu indicated. At this point we were starving, so we didn't even mention it. About 45 minutes after the apps were brought, our meals came. The wild boar was good, although the mushrooms were ice cold. The veal dish was absolutely terrible, my boyfriend hated it. So, you'd think our waiter would be trying very hard to make us happy by this point-WRONG. He did offer us dessert on the house, but we were so angry by this point and quite frankly, did not want to spend another minute in the restaurant. The waiter then brings us our check, which had all of our appetizers, drinks, and meals on, INCLUDING the 2 duck meals that we did not get. Honestly, that was the last draw for us. You'd think this waiter would be sure our check is right, after all that went wrong. Our waiter was horrible. Our service was horrible. Our meals were average at best. It was also very Cold in the restaurant, and for Valentines Day weekend, it wasn't even busy. Now I know why. Save yourself a trip, it doesn't even deserve one star..",

Service was extremely slow even though it wasn't very crowed, can't emagine why!!!  My sister in laws sea bass smelled so bad that some of us had to walk outside for air. The duck was extremely dry, not a good choice. The pizza was probably the safest choice. The owner/chef seemed to be intoxicated and I felt he should of taken everything off my check. I felt bad for the waitress, she actually did a great job with what she had to deal with!! Not worth a second chance!!!!",

I went there for brunch on a snowy Sunday and found a warm delicious meal waiting for me. Each of our meals was made to order, carefully prepared, and served with fresh baked (in house) moist bread. I had a mozzarella and tomato quiche, mom had a vegetable omelette. The owners, Nancy and Paul, were great hosts and added a touch of \"personal\" to the whole brunch. The mimosa (hey, it was Sunday, cold, and snowy outside) was made of fresh squeezed juice. I wish a had a photo of the meal, but it looked so good I forgot about photos and just started eating. I look forward to many meals there, and fun times sitting at their beautiful bar ordering from an impressive wine list. This was not only brunch, it was a great time.",

We ordered 3 appetizers for the table and a few bottles of wine.  Each of us tried a different main course.  We tried a little of each and all of them were delicious.  The owner/chef came out to check on us and told us about the food and his style of cooking.  He was pleasant and took a lot of pride in his establishment.

Today, as every time before, the food was simply excellent.  In this instance, I had a Duck breast over Risotto with wild cherry sauce. The duck was well seared, flavorful, and pleasantly juicy. Served with a small side of delightfully crispy skin and a well balanced cherry sauce, the meal doesn't disappoint even in the slightest.  The staff also deserves some mention as they've always been pleasant and on this particular visit I had a moment to speak with the Chef and hear his first hand interest and passion for creating exquisite meals.  On a more recent trip we got a menu item the Chef suggested, which was Alfredo and Duck. It was absolutely delightful. I'm a duck enthusiast and that man knows how to cook it, flawlessly. I really cannot stress how satisfied I come away from my eating experiences at Nancettas.",

Where to start, I read reviews and got excited this could be a place for me to go when I come to town.  Took my family and my sisters family here for dinner. First red flag is no children's menu - yes flexibility they can make something for us -- price still adult prices. We ordered (read menu for official names): spicy sausage/peppers/spaghetti - it was really good but smallest dish ever for $18.  I also ordered side salad for $6 also small but dressing was very good Italian (emulsified it)  Mom loved her gnocchi with marinara and wished they had a few more on the plate. Husband did not like his chicken Alfredo-cheese was like a Mac and cheese dish.  They were out of ravioli and lasagna.  We were never told about the specials that after ordering we heard the waitress tell the next table. My sister loves eggplant parmigiana and it comes out with the breading tasting pan burned-I tasted and agreed.  There appeared to only be one waitress and we never got refills on our drinks and the food took what seemed to be forever coming out of the kitchen. Could be a place for a romantic dinner and definitely the noodles are delicious but don't go if you are hoping for a lot of food for the price and I'd leave the kids at home. They don't need an $18 meal.",

The common threads are yummy food, multiple vegetarian options, great service, and no one else in the restaurant. Each time we thought they were closed based on how few cars were in the parking lot, only to be greeted by the smiling owner and seated in an empty dining area.  I don't know if people don't know it's tucked away back here or if we come at off times, or what.  Regardless, we have never been disappointed, and it's kind of nice to be able to hear the music play in the background and not have to talk over anyone!  Service is always super accommodating. The first thing they tell you is they can do whatever you want and everything is made to order. This is our family's dream since we all have different dietary preferences or restrictions. This is one of the few places you don't have to feel uncomfortable asking for special substitutions-or a meal not even on the menu!  Bread is fresh, pasta homemade, and you can tell special care is taken to each meal. Will definitely continue to come back.   Special note: For dinner we had a server named \"John\" who was really great. Was excellent with my 1 yo daughter, getting her special bread so she didn't burn her mouth or have to wait for the hot bread to cool. Extra touches like this are worth mentioning. Thank you !!!",

Both waiters were friendly and attentive and the owner walked around helping to serve, bus tables and do what ever was needed. That's it for the good parts.  We did not know that they did not have a liquor license and they offered a glass of  complimentary wine. That was nice but the wine arrived in 2 dirty glasses-they had large stains and lip stick. They looked like they had merely been rinsed and allowed to dry. We asked for new glasses. Shortly afterwards I watched th waiter deliver 2 filthy glasses to the next table-the patrons did not take note but we did.  We ordered the beans and greens. It arrived and looked great but was bland and we had to add salt and pepper liberally to get some flavor. We love beans a greens and so were disappointed.  Next came the salads. Both had a mix of old slimy lettuce bits along with yellowed and old pieces of salad. We asked for new salads and they came promptly and cheerfully but again we picked through the salad to remove the bad lettuce.  Next, after a long 30 minute wait, came the eggplant parmesian. It was very attractive and we were disappointed to find that it was luke warm and had little taste.  Our son ordered the pizza margherita. Again, it looked wonderful but was disappointing. The tomatoes were hard and not flavorful and there was little flavor from the cheese. The basil could be tasted but nothing else.  We were all disappointed and my wife and I said unrehersed at the same time, \"what a shame.\"  We wanted to love this place but cannot-unfortunatley we will not return. The owner does not know that she has a quailty control problem with the quality of the food they put in front of customers, getting food out in a reasonable amount of time as well with the way they clean their glasses. If you go there I hope you have a better experience.",

I should have left after another customer complained about his undercooked pork chop and sent it back 3x. Few customers were there so hard to explain excessive wait for mediocre food. Salad was not fresh and the  waiter said the bread was home made fresh from oven but it was not warm. Pasta chewy. Large menu but son ordered meat lasagne and waiter came back and said they only have vegetable lasagne. Very disturbing place.",

    "text": "What a delightful surprise within 20 minutes of our home! We found this restaurant on Yelp because we were looking for a new place to try.   When we pulled in, there were only 2 cars in the lot and it made me think they weren't open. I asked my fiance if maybe that was a bad sign, and then we decided that we wanted to have the experience no matter what. We are so glad we went in!  We were one of two couples in the place, so we were seated immediately. The hostess was our server because they didn't have a server that night. We ordered drinks which came out timely, and then we put in an order for a Caesar salad to share and our dinner orders of chicken Romano and the veal medallions. The Caesar salad was a little over priced for what you get, so I wouldn't recommend tacking on $10 to your tab for a salad. Save it for your entree and dessert. The Caesar dressing was authentic though, so if you're in the mood to splurge, then splurge away! We also had bread with butter and pesto oil that was very good!  Our dinners came out around an hour after we were seated, so considering everything is made in house and to order, an hour was the perfect wait. We had plenty of time to have a wonderful conversation and let our salad digest. My veal medallions was delicious, although for $26, I thought the pieces of veal would have been more substantial. Overall it was a very good meal. My fiance has the chicken Romano. He raved about it! I took a bite, and it was delicious!   We decided to make a whole night of it and ordered the chocolate explosion with berries. It was worth the 15 minute wait for it to be warmed up.   The decor was lovely, and I really loved the look of the bar area. We are excited to go back to try more things from the menu. We spent more than we had planned, but I think one of the best parts of this restaurant is that it can fit a less expensive budget if you don't add on the salad, drinks and dessert. Even without all of those extras, our dinner would have been excellent. Can't wait to return!",

Pre-cooking saves time but sacrifices the blend of flavors and texture in the dish.  Make it an enjoyable evening at Nancetta's in their beautiful dining room with a glass of wine as your crafted dish is prepared to order. I recommend their homemade pasta and the homemade gnocchi melts in your mouth! Also try the grilled Spanish octopus and fresh fish dishes. Outstanding chicken Romano too;-)",

I had pasta with rabbit. This was a large portion of food. The past was cooked al dente and was perfect, and I couldn't believe how much rabbit meat there was on the plate. I had to take some home. This was my first time eating rabbit. It's tender and has a similar taste to chicken but a little more \"gamey.\" I also got a side of gnocchi and wow! It's so light and melts in your mouth. The best gnocchi I've ever had.   This will go down as one of my favorites, and I will go back frequently!",

When my wife's entree was not brought with mine, after the waitress said they ran out of feta. Not sure how that causes the meal to be delayed. It arrived 15 minutes later very hot, while my plate was mildly warm. Especially after sitting while I waited for her plate. The food is fantastic, but the service and is terrible. Good is brought to you in piecemeal and slowly. We watched another large group leave after waiting too long. Hiring additional help would go a long way. Need another server and kitchen help. Food is great, but you can only forgive so much terrible service when there are great restaurants in our city to compete with. Needs significant improvement, but something tells me this owner doesn't care and is satisfied with his product.",

    "text": "Nancettas is amazing!! I can't believe this place only has 3 1/2 stars! If you love authentic Italian food like I do, this is the closest to Italy that you'll get in Pittsburgh!   I had dinner reservations on a Saturday night for my boyfriend, my parents, and I.  When we arrived, we sat at the bar for a drink before we sat at our table. We ended up making great conversation with the owners, a fabulous couple who are both so sweet! They even brought us out a plate of his homemade Soppressata. My father has had a lot of soppressata in his life (including his own family's homemade in Italy) and he said this was the best he's ever had! The rest of us agreed with him as well. They also had homemade bread with an amazing olive oil dipping sauce. They kept bringing it out, and we continued to eat it!   For dinner, it was a beautiful June night, so we decided to eat outside. All of the other customers were also eating outside ( I don't think anyone was inside eating). Their patio is so cute, covered with trees and umbrellas! We continued to have amazing service during our meal by both the owners and our waitress. For my dinner, I ordered chicken piccata and shared a side of the gnocchi with Chris. Both were amazing! Everyone else said how amazing their meals were too- eggplant parm, veal parm, and Chris tried rabbit (which was actually great!)   Since we were there to celebrate, we also decided to get dessert! Even though we were all full, we saw the table next to us order dessert and we were basically drooling looking at it. The 4 of us shared the lemon tart & the raspberry chocolate chip gelato. I am not much of dessert person but these were both amazing & the perfect ending to a great meal! Even if you don't live close to Nancettas (like us) it was worth the drive! I cannot wait to come back!!",

    "text": "TL;DR - waited 60 min for mediocre app, 90 minutes for mediocre soup and salad, 120 min for decent mains. Beautiful decor, flawed concept.   The good: the restaurant is absolutely beautifully decorated inside. The waitress knew the menu very well, was polite, made good suggestions, and never let our water glasses get even half empty. The veal Romano and seafood pasta dishes were tasty.   The bad: I wanted to take my mom out somewhere nice for an early mother's day dinner. She had been wanting to try this place out for a long time. The restaurant is very small and it was hard to make a reservation. When we got there, it was practically empty of people but full of tables. The two of us were seated at a table for 6. Why...I don't know. Because there were too many tables, we were practically sitting with the two women next to us.   It took over 10 minutes for the manager to tell us the specials. Another few minutes the one and only waitress came and took our drink order. Once our drinks are delivered, we ordered an appetizer (risotto balls), the veal and leek soup, and the best salad. The risotto balls came....45 minutes later. They were OK (nothing to write home about). Another 30 minutes later my soup arrives but my mom's salad wasn't ready. At 8:30 (90 minutes into dinner), my mom's salad finally arrived. Again, the food was OK. At this point we're beginning to get upset at how long we've waited to have our appetizer, soup, and salad served. There were only 8 people in the dining room and everyone has been waiting far too long and starts asking the waitress where the food was. We can all tell she's getting upset that a nearly empty dining room is full of hungry customers.   The ugly: At this point, it's almost 9 pm and everyone has been there since between 7 and 7:30. The waitress starts apologizing to everyone about the delay. She says this is typical and whenever she puts pressure on the kitchen, she states the chef just yells at her. Several couples just ask for their food to go. At 9:00, the food starts coming out. Everyone has been served except us. We hear our waitress tell the chef she still needs a veal Romano. Does that mean they didn't ever start cooking our food? Our food arrives at 9:15...2 hours and 5 minutes after we were seated. We ate some of our meals but we were just too tired to eat any more. We get the rest of our meals wrapped up to go.   Nancettas prides itself on its meals being \"scratch made in house.\" They state that their meals take a little longer than most restaurants. Making your customers wait 2 hours is bad for business.   How can a restaurant be successful if it alienates its customers by making them wait an ungodly amount of time before serving them? How can a restaurant be profitable if it can only turn a table once in a dinner session? The issue here is management turning a blind eye to a major issue and a failed concept. We will not be back and we certainly will not be recommending this place to anyone.",

There was 1 server and 1 bartender but they had 2 tables each. Then we got our salads about an hour into it and dinner 2 hours after walking into the building. I had to ask where the food was and she was shocked. When I went to ask her I found her making the salads without gloves and eating while she made them. There are other things that left a bad taste in my mouth but all I need to say is that if you want a 4 hour leisurely dinner then this is the place but don't expect to be serviced or have food in front of you.",
