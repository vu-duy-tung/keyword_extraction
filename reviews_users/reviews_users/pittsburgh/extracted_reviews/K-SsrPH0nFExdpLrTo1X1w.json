Mom, Dad, and Aunt picked me and my fiance up from the airport around noon and we headed to Burgatory for a much anticipated lunch/reunion/watching of the Penn State game.  Sadly, they don't have the Big 10 Network and we couldn't watch the game! Just 3 hours outside of Happy Valley and no PSU football?! Bars in Honolulu are open at 6 am to accommodate us Nittany Lions and this place doesn't have the right channel?  We had one drink and left, sorry Burgatory.",

Everything I've tried there was always great. The seating in the main dining area can be really tight....meaning, you can look as though you are sitting WITH other diners that aren't in your group...yep, it's that close! But, other areas have more space. Try the onion rings; they are huge and delicious; especially with the kickin' ketchup. If you are a vegetarian, you MUST try phat patty's veggie burger. You won't be disappointed. The bison burger is my hubby's favorite. The fact that this place uses LOCAL produce and ingredients is always a bonus! They help support local charities and businesses! That, I appreciate.",

They accept no reservations and no call ahead for putting your name on the list, so when you have a large family, it's impossible to go there for anything at a normal eating hour. Burgers are my kiddo's favorite and I would have loved to treat him to it after a celebration for him, but the wait on a Saturday was 1 hr. 45 min. No, thank you. Moral of the story, if you have something special going on and want to treat the crew to lunch or dinner, especially on the weekend, you might be better of going somewhere else. Definitely, if you are a party of 6-9.   Having been there before, I knew the food was good. It's a little different, and worth trying if you are a small group at an off time.",

    "text": "I love the original Burgatory location, and dream about their milkshakes, even if I still think Tessaro's has the hands down best burger in the 'Burgh. Burgatory's are definitely almost as good, and they've got tons of topping options... plus those milkshakes.  My husband has never been to Burgatory before, and requested that we visit the new location for his birthday weekend; turning 30 calls for ice cream and burgers, right? We figured we'd go around 2pm on Sunday, hoping not to wait too long -- a friend tried on Friday night and gave up with a 2 hour wait time. It's good, but not THAT good, yanno?   We arrived and the hostess entered our information into a tablet computer that may have been an iPad; I was hungry enough I didn't notice. She asked us if a 30-45 minute wait was OK and we said it was; she let us know we'd get a text when our table was ready. 40ish minutes and no text later, we went and asked, and she told us she'd been about to remove us from the waiting list since they'd sent a text and we hadn't replied. Ahem. We were sitting ten feet away from her, so that was a little offputting. Maybe don't rely on the vagaries of the cellular providers so much?  The seating in this location was a little cramped, as well; I felt like I was sharing a table with the party next to us, which wasn't an issue at the original location. I'm picky about seating; what can I say?  Luckily, our server was wonderful and made up for the rocky start. He was super efficient in getting our drinks and taking our order without making us feel rushed.  We each started with a milkshake; I went for the PB&J I know and love, while the husband tried the Salted Nutella Crunch. After one sip of his, I wished I'd changed my order. It was delicious and perfectly Nutella-flavored, although could've done with a little more salt. The PB&J was amazing as usual, though; I love the blobs of jelly, personally.   Both of us also opted to create our own burgers. Mine had a bison patty, brioche bun, angel dust rub, blue cheese, onion marmalade, truffled shallot aioli, and mixed greens, with dill pickles on the side. I unfortunately have to order burgers well-done these days, but that's the embryo's fault, not Burgatory's. It tasted great anyway, and the mixed greens were excellent. Basically it was the same as one of the menu burgers but with bison and onion marmalade rather than Wagyu and roasted tomatoes. Husband felt it had a \"sour\" taste and didn't like it, but, when pressed, was unable to identify any further reasons. The dill pickle chips, sadly, were vinegary and unremarkable, and went uneaten.  He went for a beef burger, again on brioche (those buns are to die for), with BBQ rub, cheddar, ranch, and bacon. I stole a few bites and would happily have eaten his burger as well as mine, if it weren't for the fact that they're huge.  There aren't descriptions of the rubs on the menu, but the servers are happy to tell you about them. I love the angel dust, personally. And I understand the herbed focaccia may be delicious, but I can't pass up the chewy-soft brioche.   We both got herb and sea salt fries rather than the chips, and they were good, though not the best fries I've ever had. I'm almost positive there's rosemary involved.  Portions are huge, and I ended up with half my burger to go, which is kind of suboptimal, for me -- reheated burgers are hardly ever worth eating. We also took half our milkshakes to go, since you get the entire metal mixing container. I wouldn't mind slightly smaller portions, but that may just be me.  Total check for two shakes and two burgers was $41 -- pricier than some other options, which means Burgatory is a semi-special occasion kind of place for us.",

Of course, I had to make out like it was wonderful, as my co-worker said Purgatory's hamburgers were better than the gourmet burger shop we have up here.  But it wasn't, not by a long shot.  I got the hormone free beef, which is supposed to be a mixture of 4 different cuts.  The burger shop up here does that, and they are great.  But this was not so much. Just not a lot of flavor.  I didn't order it with any rub because I didn't see anything that appealed to me, but some salt and pepper would have been nice.  The toppings were fresh, and the bun was decent.  But otherwise, the meat just didn't wow me like I've had elsewhere.  On the plus side, I enjoyed the beer selection, and the beans were excellent.  I'd just like a big bowl of those!!  But overall, not a bad hamburger, about like a Five Guys. Just not what I expected with all the hype the place has.  Guess I'm going to the local gourmet burger shop for lunch today!!",

The first time I went was for dinner, and I had their Fork It appetizer (fries smothered in braised short ribs and gravy with cheese curds--aka poutine).  It was delicious, but incredibly rich, and it got mushy and soupy the more I dug into the dish.  The Dogfish Head Indian brown ale that I got to drink was a good choice (they have a small but excellent selection of craft beers).  The second time I went was during a busy lunch hour.  I had a build-your-own burger with provolone, avocado, caramelized onion jam, and bacon.  Tasty, but very messy.  The onion jam was to die for.  I also got their special shake of the day--vanilla ice cream, vanilla pudding, and Oreos.  Like dirt pudding in milkshake form; it was even topped with a gummy worm.  Delicious!  Both times I went my server was personable, fun, and knowledgeable.  I like the decor and atmosphere a lot, though I also agree with some reviewers about it being noisy and crowded.  The first time I went was later at night so it was a little less busy, but during lunch time on my second trip it was a zoo.  I'd recommend going before or after peak meal hours.",

The shake of the day was cookie dough, and I couldn't pass it up! We both made our own burgers. My friend wishes they'd give more than just the 3 choices offered for how you'd like your burger cooked. We both enjoyed our burgers, and we would come back again.

    "text": "After a couple of visits, I am totally a fan of this place.  Whoever is the mastermind of this concept has got to be doing well.  Where else can you have your shake cost just as much as your burger?  Genius!    The first visit, our family went with:  Salted Nutella Crunch shake ($6) - delicious - enough for our table of 4 to split Grand-dad shake ($8) - lots of caramel and bourbon - would be good as a dessert if you have room to spare Morty's Steakhouse ($10.50) - lots of flavors going on here - everything sort of got muddled by the end. Standard Deluxe ($8.50) - my wife loved her choice of burger.  Simple, to the point, delicious. The kids got chicken tenders and the hot dog ($6 each) and you get a choice between a Cherry Coke Float or a Coke Float as a dessert.  On the second visit, my wife and I each got the Standard Deluxe and we skipped the shakes.  The burgers were perfectly cooked and dressed - simplicity was key here!  I opted for the $1.50 upcharge for fries instead of the homemade chips.  This was a great choice - there were rosemary sprigs in the fries which really added some great flavor to them.    On both visits, there was a substantial wait of 1 hour+.  When you check in, you give them your cell number and the hostess will text you when your table is ready.  If you have a smartphone, even better.  Click the link on the confirmation text you receive and you can actually track your wait on your phone's web browser.  When I checked in, there was a tracker showing me there were 22 parties ahead of me.  Each time I refreshed, I was given a real time view of how we were moving up in the queue.  This allowed our family to run some errands and accurately track how much time we had before being seated.  This is a great feature.  My only criticism has got to be the service.  The food is worth coming back - don't get me wrong.  However, both visits were a bit uneven in the service department.  Drinks went unrefilled for long stretches of time and a bit of a lag waiting for our check.  Our servers were courteous on both visits - just a little hard to find when I needed something.",

The burgers are delicious, my customer creation included pink waygu with cracked peppercorn rub on brioche topped with farmhouse cheddar, bourbon bbq sauce, fried egg, bacon, onion straws, pickles, and banana peppers. Spend the money for the fries and get ranch, yummy. The milkshakes are also delicious, thick and flavorful.

Only had time to stop for lunch in Pittsburgh, and I think I made an admirable choice.  Build your own burger is the way to go. For most things, they don't dock you more money. You can make a great burger for $10.50, which includes $9.50 for a beef burger and a buck for the cheese. If you're feeling in the mood for the wilder ingredients, you'll only suffer minor up-charges.  I really enjoyed the truffle aioli, the truffle rub, and the grilled mushrooms? See a pattern? I tell you, if you get all that stuff, you don't really need a bison burger or that admittedly clever \"fiddy-fiddy\" bacon burger. It's got enough flavor added to it, so dig into that good old fashioned beef burger, and get it PINK.",

The bartender / server ordered me and charged me for fries even though I ordered chips but took it right off when I mentioned it to him.

The restaurant itself was very clean and the service was fantastic. My fiance was guzzling water but she stayed on top of keeping drinks refilled and was super happy to answer any questions we had. I knew right away that I wanted my own burger my own way. I really like that it had the menu option to build your own burger! Nice! I love avacodo and egg on my burgers ( when I do eat them) I was very impressed with the way the burger tasted. The chips that came along with it were OKay. I wished They had all been cooked the same, some were a little more done than my taste. They were still really good tho! Love the place I will be back! Whe I return I will enjoy a milk shake too!!!",

Their burgers are always over-cooked no matter how you ask them to be grilled and they use really cheap buns. Their food is just not good.  Everything is super over priced based on the quality of what you get. The wait is always horrendous too.  This was a really cool place to eat when it first opened; you couldn't pay me to eat there again.",

    "text": "I live in a very small town. I know a few places you can get a good Burger and some places where you should not get a Burger. I have had burgers from all over North America and a few from Europe. So when a friend told me that Burgatory made the best burgers I decided to give it a try. Business took me down this road and I ended up here, with a hunger for some tasty cow. There was a small wait (6:00PM on a Friday, what should you expect), but before long I was seated and trying to sort out my burger.  I elected to make my own with a Wheat roll, sauteed Mushrooms, Garlic Mayo, a few veggies, and of course some beef. My order came up pretty quickly and I was treated to one of the best burgers I have had in a restaurant. It was cooked perfectly, the toppings were all fresh, and they didn't over do or under do the toppings. Having eaten 100 burgers in a couple dozen cities was this burger the best I have ever had? No, but it is in the top 5 easy. Burgatory isn't just good, it is great. I will be stopping here again on my next time through.",

    "text": "I love burgers. I love that I can create my own burger at Burgatory.  There's a menu that you check off: bun, rub, sauce, cheese, toppings (some cost extra), meat type, doneness. There is usually a special, and this day is was a boring burger (cheddar, lettuce, tomato, garlic aoili) I often get a garlic aoili, +/- farmhouse cheddar, grilled pineapple and grilled jalapenos.  I ALWAYS get my burger well done.  Why? Because unless it's a cut of beef (steak, roast, etc), cooking the outside does not kill the bacteria that can make you ill. So, ground beef, as it sounds, needs to be cooked to a particular temperature to be safe to consume, hence the disclaimers on menus.  I don't play with meat--it get's cooked, but, every time I'm here I get an extremely dry burger that is charred on the outside.  The char is usually cleverly hidden by the toppings, but I can taste it.  And you can certainly get a good burger well done--not dried and burnt and tastes like the griddle/grill lubricant.  That's my beef with this place (pun intended).  I also wish they'd seed the jalapenos, as they are bitter (FACT: seeds do not cause the heat, capsaicin in the pith and vein does).  Otherwise, the burger has the potential to be awesome.  The fries are good, but the flavor from the herbs may not be present, depending on who is spicing your fries.  This last time, my water went unfilled, my burger burnt, my jalapenos bitter and my BBQ sauce nearly non-existent because it's sucked into the sponge of a bun.  I enjoy this place, but would much rather drive up to Burgh'ers in Zelienople or even head to Five Guys next door--as they are at least consistent and can give me a well done burger that doesn't taste like it's been sitting on a warmer for an hour. On a happy note, you're better off investing in a milkshake.",

Delicious. My boyfriend had the \" Meat Your Maker\" and he said it was \"a culinary orgasm\".   On our second visit we decided to split a Meat Your Maker and the burger of the day which happened  to be a duck patty, with duck confit, sauteed onions, tomato jam, and bacon. What a GREAT decision. We also had Herb's Grape Refresher, it wasn't too sweet and had a wonderful taste.   Our server was Cindy and she was fantastic, she put up with my boyfriends odd jokes and made sure we were happy at all times!   The wait is worth it! These people know what tastes go well together and I look forward to their future creations.",

Passed by Burgatory and though it looked interesting.  My wife and I go in (my wife doesn't eat red meat, so I was thinking I would leave with troubles), but we both really enjoyed our lunches.  She couldn't decide between the Psychedelic 'Shroom \"burger\" and the Crab Shack \"burger\".  We decided to order both and share.  We were quite impressed.  We both agreed the Crab would taste better on a different bread selection.  On the menu, it comes on a regular roll.  I would try a different option next time.  The Schroom burger was extremely flavorful and put together well.  We both left happy and were glad we made a new discovery!",

I chose a chicken burger on foccia Cajun dusted, Habernero Honey Mustard, onions, and jalapeno.(yes I like it spicy) The spiked milkshake of the day was a chocolate covered strawberry #heaven.

The bartenders were more interested in talking to one another then to serve anyone. Once I finally DID get my chance to order, the Long Island I got tasted like what I imagine dirty bath water would taste like. Worst drink ever. After 40 min of this we went and asked how much longer and somehow another 15 minutes had been added.   Left and went to Quaker Steak.   It's too loud there, no room to move around comfortably, sad drinks, and poor service. It would take a miracle to get me back to try again.",

Their seasoning options, toppings, etc are outstanding and so fresh.   I have tried all the meat options and have never been disappointed.     Fries vs in house chips - CHIPS!  (Especially with their spicy ketchup!)     Milkshakes - I am lactose intolerant, so I have not been able to enterain.  However, when my friends/family get them, they always look amazing and they always rave about them.     Service - has always been outstanding - the staff is so friendly and helpful.   My only complaints are 1. the chili is very bland 2. the onion rings are always soggie and gross   Definitely hit it up though!  Whenever I am home in Pittsburgh, it is a must stop.",

Perched on a beautifully toasted Brioche bun, the PB&J is a fat burger made from ground bacon mixed with ground beef. As if that wasn't already enough, it is topped with creamy melted white American cheese, candied bacon, habernero pepper jelly, sweet bread and butter pickle chips, and the crowning jewel...peanut butter. You may say that I had you until the peanut butter, but don't judge...it was pure burger Nirvana. To my recollection, it is the most superb burger I've ever had the privilege of consuming. Pair this with shoestring French fries and an ice cold draft beer and it really doesn't get any better. They also have boozy milkshakes that are phenomenal. If you are in the area, do not hesitate to hit up Burgatory.",

They are so crispy and fresh. Sometimes you get a sweet potato chip or 2 in the mix, and wow-soo good! And you can never go wrong with the salted caramel pretzel shake. Omg.

It seemed double ground because it was as smooth at velvet in texture, properly seasoned and presented wonderfully. I opted for the mixed greens salad, thinking of my cardiologist, with the vinegarette dressing. The dressing is perfectly mixed and not the slightest bit sharp because of vinegar. The Elk was also lean so while it remained perfectly moist during the cooking process fat was not running off it. I found my pre-meal bar drink to be of sufficient pour and reasonably priced. This was my first visit and I cannot wait to return to Pittsburgh and visit this clean and well managed eatery again!",

    "text": "I wish that I could say Burgatory is overhyped and unworthy of the always-crowded status, but when it comes to the burgers and shakes, it's fully-deserved. We've only been to this location one time, but if I'm comparing this with the original location, I'd give the nod to Robinson. It's simply more open and the bigger bar gives you better odds of getting a seat, which if you've ever tried to eat at Burgatory, you know is the biggest issue.  First, I have to say that the burnt almond torte milkshake is one of my favorite gluttonous treats ever. In fact, the shakes...in particular, THAT shake...has lured me to Burgatory more than the burgers. I'm particularly fond of their heavy whipped cream and the fact that there's actual burnt almond torte blended in. I personally prefer it sans-alcohol, but the adult version is good. I just think it's better without the vodka. They're special shakes are always tempting, too, but aside from the pumpkin pie, which was awesome, I can't stop ordering the burnt almond torte.  As far as burgers go, I've never had a bad one at Burgatory. I've tried their regular blend, the buffalo, and the elk. All three are simply delicious, with my favorite currently being the elk, cooked medium to avoid the lean meat from becoming too tough. I've enjoyed their burgers as-is from the menu, but if you're not into things like bacon jam and caramelized onion, you can always fill out the custom burger form at the table. Frankly, the burgers themselves are actually good enough that the toppings are totally unnecessary, so I think you're safe either way.  The sides are probably the most underwhelming part of the meal. They just don't standout after such good burgers and shakes. The quinoa was definitely not my favorite dish, but the fries are solid. The onion ring are good, but be warned...the appetizer is a huge order.  Overall, if you're looking for a tasty burger, Burgatory is a great option. I still give my vote to Winghart's if you're just looking for a good burger, but Burgatory is a close second. If you're looking for both a great burger AND a delicious shake, Burgatory can't be beat. Regardless of your appetite, though, there's really no restaurant in Pittsburgh that's worth the wait that Burgatory tends to have after 5 PM. We've resorted to using the No Wait app to see the wait time and get our name on if it's reasonable. Enjoy!",

I had the Farmer Brown, which has an egg and bacon. It's all right, but not juicy and drippy like a truly awesome burger. The meat was as I said cooked to the right temperature but somehow they dried it out.   was unthrilled by the hostess trying to put me at a high top in an almost empty restaurant without asking, but she complied quickly when I objected. It gets four stars primarily because I'm grading on a curve -- it's in a real desert and is by far the best choice among a hundred terrible chains like Ditka's and tgi Friday's.",

    "text": "Kay wanted to shop at the Robinson Mart o' Walls but insisted on eating first. Once I remembered that a new Burgatory location had opened in the area, I couldn't think of anywhere else to eat. Strip mall ahoy!  Thinking it was a conscious decision for the both of us. I was not at all cognizant that we were placed into this position by...The Adversary. Figurines of Kay and I lay before Him on a vast chessboard. Still longing to wreck my future through his demonic machinations, The Adversary recalls previous encounters whilst watching us through a crystal ball...  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/delucas-restaurant-pittsburgh#hrid:ujK9GEqNt2d6Ji3hoH_tag\">yelp.com/biz/delucas-res...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/burgatory-pittsburgh#hrid:eqiVMI-q2h49P8ajOTdwww\">yelp.com/biz/burgatory-p...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/burgatory-pittsburgh#hrid:Rhb5vULWEG26sjb2hLiahQ\">yelp.com/biz/burgatory-p...</a>  As fate would have it, we arrived minutes before the Sunday lunchtime rush, narrowly avoiding a long wait by snagging the last table available at the moment, one built...for two. Fate: She is crafty.   Industrial decor similar to that of the Fox Chapel location threatened to mesmerize us. Slogans, Venn diagrams (pentagrams?), and maps to Hell distracted us from the mission upon us.   I looked to the ceiling and saw His visage, His...grinning visage for a split second. For the next several moments by body was under his control, and I could hear His voice in my ears, echoing, tormenting...  Our lovely server Sarah B.(Hello!) came to take our order. As if guided by unseen hands, on the notepad provided, I automatically checked off the components of a burger that would threaten to swallow my soul...whole!  \"Let's see Mr. Steel? Is it? Heh heh. You'll be having the Dry Aged Wagyu Beef on a baguette bun as you did for our virgin clash with coleslaw, bread-n-butter pickles, guacamole, onion straws, fried egg, aged gruyere this trick as well as grilled pineapple, and...oh, why not? Bacon. With fries of course. Let's not forget the Memphis rub and Truffled Shallot Aioli.\"  \"Too easy, devil,\" I spat back.  \"Oh, let's include some Braised Pork Belly Sliders also. That should finish you off before you get to MOAB or even Ginormo, the chocolate chip cookie sundae.\"   A trio of hellpigs came armored in buttered buns, the zombie ungulates' blood running with whole grain mustard and homemade bourbon BBQ sauce. Onion straws added crunch as did the punchy coleslaw. Lard, crispy, lard threatened to strangle my aorta, yet Kay and I dispatched them with a swift brutality fueled by hunger.   The golem of meat was constructed in a whirlwind of green mist and stumbled towards me...growling, directed by The Adversary's taloned, bony finger, carrying a demonic, pitchfork-like flag with my epitaph on it.  \"Attack, my creation!\"  Shards of salted potatoes, ideal in their blend of crisp, chewy, and soft, were caught by me and devoured, defying the monster and his master.   I leapt upon its back, munching through the baguette hide of the creature, puncturing its supple, rich wagyu insides, the guacamole adding more decadence, the aioli turning my lunch into a Luciferian opium-laden orgy, the onion straw snakes making it near deadly. I persevered, holding the abomination's defeated body over my head.  \"Bring me Ginormo!\" I cried.  \"ROOOAAARRRR!!!\" The behemoth responded, sounding like a thousand rusty gates opening at once.   The Adversary rode atop its back of golden vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate and caramel veins. The oven-fresh cookie was doughy, slightly salty, and dusted with powered sugar, the cold ice cream never detracting from its ductile nature. His taunts driving me, I broke down the sundae with scoops and chomps, savoring the fudge and the richness-cutting dairy products.   As I finished the last lump of ice cream, The Adversary vanished with a look of terror and astonishment on his chiseled face.   \"MOAB will finish him. I know this.\"  My stomach stuffed almost beyond capacity, I managed to keep nausea at bay. Sarah's adorable face was flush with relief and joy for I had conquered malevolence on this day.   P.S. According to Kay, I have a fan (?!?) in Sarah B. Apparently I was discussed as I used the restroom prior to our departure. This one's for you, Sarah! Sorry for taking so long to put up the review!",

You can also drop by and leave your name with the hostess and once a seat opens up, they will text you and give you 10 mins or so to show up.  I have tried the \"Meat Your Maker\" and the \"Morty's Steakhouse.\" While both are great, I prefer making my own burger with just the right stuff I need.  My preferences for a perfect burger:  Hormone Free Beef is better than Dry Aged Wagyu (not tried any other meat here - the beef patty is soft, melt in your mouth goodness - I prefer mine cooked medium) Can't go wrong with a Brioche bun Angel Dust, Kona Crust, Kingston Jerk, Cracked Peppercorn (all taste perfect) Smoked Gouda, Horseradish Cheddar, Aged Gruyere Roasted Garlic Mayo, Truffled Shallot Aioli Bacon, Jalapenos (my favorite add-ons)  The house sweet-potato fries are good, they are just an extra for me.... The Salted Nutella Crunch and the Caramel Pretzel Shakes are great (and definitely sharable unless you have a serious appetite and the capacity for a zillion calories).  If you have not yet tried Burgatory, you need to ASAP.",

Good Lord I almost couldn't eat my meal when I got a shake first.   It started to fill me right up.   So, as I said, I started with the Fluffy Nutter Butter something shake-  OMG , heaven in a straw... one of the best...ok actually... the best milkshake I have had in years.   I started sipping its deliciousness, only to fill up quickly... so I stopped and shared with the table.  Thank goodness, since I didn't want to miss what is next.   Ordered some parmesan fries..... GREAT!!! I love when the fries have some of those tiny crunchy pieces. YUM.    And of course, the burger.  Super good, not dry, cooked just right... none of that grease ( save that for the fry basket. )   Yes, Good.  Great.  Just so super satisfying.   Not fast food, just good food.....   worth a try!!!",

    "text": "I have dined at the Burgatory location in the Waterworks plaza multiple times but have only eaten here once. I came with a large group (10-12, I think?) on a Wednesday evening, and the staff did a good job of getting us all seated within 30-45 minutes, even though some of the group was running late.  My husband, a friend, and I shared the Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites. I had only been able to steal a few of these fries in the past, so I absolutely stuffed my face with them when I had a larger supply! By the time my Morty's Steakhouse burger arrived, I was almost completely full. Though I know it's one of Burgatory's most popular burgers, I did not really enjoy it.... However, I had just eaten about 2 lbs of gorgonzola-covered fries, so that may be why. For my milkshake, I ordered my go-to -- Salted Nutella Crunch with Chocolate Vodka. As always, it was absolutely delicious.  The most impressive part about my experience was the service. The waitress was initially intimidating with a short, \"aggressive\" haircut and covered with tattoos. Looking at her, I thought she would be one of those people you would timidly ask for a refill of water, hoping she wouldn't bite your head off. However, her personality couldn't be any more different than her look. She was one of the best waitresses that I've ever had. We had three small children in our large party, and she catered to their needs exceptionally well. She delivered their meals early, just so they wouldn't be hungry. Their mom would normally order a milkshake and split it herself. However, she brought their milkshakes in little plastic cups, each one decorated on top. I could go on and on. She just made the experience very comfortable for the parents of these children.  I hope when I come back that she is my waitress again! If I could remember her name, I would give her credit in this review. She made our dining experience truly 5 stars.",

To this day, the \"meat your maker\" burger in particular is THE best burger i've ever had. I've searched far and wide for something that's at least comparable and nothing has compared. I had to pleasure of dining at Burgatory last nite with family. I ordered the meat your maker burger as i always do. Tasted as good as i remember it the last time. I also ordered the Choco-Taco hard milkshake which was delicious! Despite my obsession with Burgatory, nothing really blew me away this time (i've eaten there before, so i wasn't shocked by how good the food was). The service was good as always. I just can't say the whole experience was exceptional.....I'm a Pittsburgh native who moved to Tampa about 4 years ago. Burgatory is the one restaurant that i wish i could move to Tampa (the burgers are that good). Burgatory management: if you're reading this, please consider expanding south!.... If you've never eaten at any of the Burgatory locations, you don't know what you're missing. I urge you to check them out ASAP! You won't regret it!!!",

I got the farmer brown burger (beef burger, over easy egg, maple cured ham, farmhouse cheddar) and friend got Morty's steakhouse burger (peppercorn crusted beef burger with horseradish cheddar, haystack onions & cabernet sauce - \"like the greatest steak dinner you've ever had reincarnated as a burger\"). Very tasty! Comes with housemade chips or fries. Mmm. All very tasty! Was also tempted to order one of their \"adult\" shakes but since I was catching a flight out, I didn't want to be to stuffed, since I couldn't take any leftovers home.  One thing that wasn't so great.. they bring fortune cookies at the end of the meal. I love fortune cookies BUT my fortune said: today is the day you meat your maker. I get that \"meat your maker\" is the name of one of their signature burgers BUT I was 2.5 hours from getting on a plane across the country so I wasn't all that amused.  Luckily I'm still here.",

We got a great booth.  Our server was super friendly and fairly attentive.  I started with a Burnt Almond Torte milkshake with actual bits of Prantl's Torte, Vanilla Vodka & Amaretto., BJ got a Rogue Dead Guy bottled beer.  My shake was so good, BJ kept stealing it!  For our burgers, BJ ordered the special of the day, it had pulled pork and onion strings on it and was served with chips.  I did the create your own burger, with Cajun spice rubbed, spicy Ketchup, romaine, red onion on a wheat bun.  It was so good!!!  My only complaint was that it needed a bit more spicy Ketchup.  I also got fries with mine.  As much as I love this place, the truth of the matter is, no one can really have a shake, and still have room for the burger.

This was the best veggie burger I've had in Pittsburgh, and among my top 3 ever. It's hearty with great flavor. It's fun to customize the burger by choosing from countless toppings. The pretzel bun paired perfectly with the burger. I've tried the focaccia which was pretty good but didn't complement the burger as well. The side salad (for an extra $1.5) is a large mix of spring greens with Parmesan and was delicious - worth it.   They also have a great selection of milkshakes and non-burger entrees which I've heard are great as well.   I've taken my mom too and she loved the chicken burger with the gluten free bun. She's tried a lot of GF foods and liked this bun so much she ate it before I could even try it.   My waiters are always friendly and kept our glasses full. The decorations give the restaurant a fun atmosphere.   Overall: 5/5 for vegetarians and it's a place where almost everyone can find something. Go.",

We have been to the Fox Chapel location, but not here as it was always insanely packed when we would want to try it.  I am so glad that we were able to come here as it made a bad experience I had at the other location way better.    Because the space is bigger, I think the likelihood of getting a seat in a timely fashion is higher.  The first thing I noticed here was the service was better than the last few times I have been to the other location... less of an attitude, and more friendly.  It was so bad at the other location the last time, I could not help but complain.  Our server here let us know it was happy hour and that apps were 1/2 off and specialty drinks were 5.00 (I thing that was what she said), and there was a discount on Craft beers too. We ordered some fries and an Almond Torte Milkshake that came out so fast. We were used to the milkshake taking forever so were very surprised by this (and my husband was very happy).  I created my own burger which was good, and the hubby seemed to be a fan of his \"Elk Gone Wild\" burger.  I cannot give it 5 Stars as I have only been here once, but I will be back and if my experience is the same I will up it to 5 because it is consistent :)",

However, our burgers at this location on a slow Tuesday evening (~9 pm, maybe ~10 customers) took 25-30 min to arrive, and both burgers were barely warm. My Impossible burger should have been pink (custom) but was well-done. The other custom burger was dry (not really the pink he specified), and they forgot the sauce. A few greens from my burger dropped to the floor as the server placed my food on the table. She acknowledged it dropped and just left it on the floor next to my chair with the sauce all through our meal. All said, this rating is based upon our experience with the server.   A burger that is barely warm with cheese and egg is just disappointing, and leads me to believe that it probably sat on the counter for a bit after it was cooked. She was most attentive returning to our table when collecting payment but did not provide 2 copies of the credit card slip (just 1 to sign and a receipt from another table)  I still love Burgatory, but I probably won't return to this location.

They did forget to put the onion straws on, but it didn't take much out of the flavor. It was a fabulous burger. The cut was probably about a quarter pound and it was very juicy on a hearty bun. The BBQ sauce was spicy, which surprised me. The burgers typically come with chips, but two of the people in my party upgraded to the jalapeno cornbread. They said it was very good and moist, and ended up being more than they could finish.   All in all, the food was great. I would go back in a heartbeat. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for the service. Forgetting the onion straws and overall attentiveness.",

I will say that it did have a nice spicy flavor to it.   My boyfriend had the meat your maker and it was pretty much the same thing. The cheddar bacon fries we had were lacking the two special ingredients. Minimal bacon and cheese, very disappointing.

    "text": "We ate here yesterday, a Sunday afternoon, around 3:00. We were seated right away, but the place was packed!  It was a tight squeeze between tables and my husband was uncomfortable in his chair; I was seated on a long bench.  Our waitress came and was very friendly. She got our drink order and offered assistance since it was our first time. She came back a couple times offering help before I finally decided what I wanted. I made my own burger- beef and bacon on brioche and various toppings. I also got a salted caramel pretzel shake.  The shake came out first. Although I don't normally order drinks I have to chew, it was pretty tasty. For being \"known for their shakes\", they didn't really have a large selection. If we were to return, I don't think I'd order another. I think Steak 'n Shake and many other places are better than Burgatory shakes.  The hamburger I got was pretty amazing. They fixed it just as I had asked and it tasted good.  All in all, I'm not sure we'd go back - mostly because we live more than an hour away and there are lots of other places to explore. If we lived in the area, we would return.",

I have to be honest, I'm not much of a burger lover but I enjoyed my dinner.   No wait, great attentive staff, great seating, atmosphere was exciting and TVs with the game on were a plus.   You have a list of amazing burgers you can pick from with different toppings. They have traditional burgers and some none traditional ones as well. I opted to try the bison burger. It came with this great buttermilk ranch sauce which made it taste amazing. You can also custom made a burger if you don't like any of the selections.   My co workers told me to try the \"home made chips\" that come with the burger and so I did. Although I wish I had selected another side like the steamed veggies or fries. The chips are what really stopped me from giving this place 5 stars. The home made fries really didn't cut it for me. Tasted kind of stale.  Let's talk about why I enjoyed this place. I was told to save room for dessert. This place has some amazing shakes. I got the coffee and donut shake. It was great, a bit sweet, but it is a dessert, after all.",

Also, if you're watching your diet, never fear- they have a naked option (bunless) and you can get a mixed field greens salad instead of fries. Somehow they manage to jazz up this salad so you never even miss the good stuff! Burgatory, you are my fav !",

They do have vegan options and the servers are very knowledgeable about their menu. I order the impossible burger every time with vegan cheddar. On their menu they do not have a option for vegan mayo, but they do have it if your ask for it! Milkshakes!! yes you can make some of them vegan!! I always go for the strawberry milkshake and you can spike it if your are having that kind of day!  As far as the alcohol goes.. their drink menu is not for me. I had the strawberry basil shag and the fresh strawberries kept coming up straight through the straw. They have a lot of fresh ingredient drinks to offer.

I had honey habanero sauce, peanut butter, bacon jam, avocado, jalapenos, and banana peppers with baked beans.  I never thought lettuce wrap would be good but it was so lite and filling . The peanut butter just makes the sandwich. I had great toppings and the whole meal came together. End review update :)  I always love a good burger . There is nothing better than a burger and a beer.   I had the veggie burger on a wheat bun. It was very good and fresh. Make sure you have the bacon jam. It was delicious and made the sandwich complete.  The service was amazing . Our server knew the menu from front to back. She even knew all the beers. She suggested really good beers to go with our burgers.  I would absolutely come back here to get another burger. I would love to try their milkshakes because I heard they were phenomenal.",

    "text": "Really kind of been holding of writing this review because my opinion of this place seems to go back and forth with every visit. In all honesty, I am not sure why I keep coming back (the most recent visit was because my sister had never been). To me it's a good burger, but nothing great.  I love the idea of building your own burger. At some burger joints I have a hard time finding a burger that will appease whatever my craving is that day. I am not picky at all, I am just a weird person that likes weird things.  Lets start with the shakes. To me they are pretty meh. I seriously hate that \"whipped cream\" they put on top of it. Before you say \"oh just order it without the whipped cream, dummy\", there has been multiple times that I have and they still put that stuff on top of my shake. The next issue is the price. I remember at some point they used to be cheaper or have I lost my mind? I just don't see their shakes being good enough for me to spend $7 on. I really don't. But that could be just because I tend to be somewhat of a tightwad. But honestly I am willing to spend the money if it is actually good.  The burgers last visit were pretty good. My sister tried the Farmer Brown which is a beef burger with an over easy egg, maple cured ham, and cheddar. I was only able to get a bite but it had a great flavor and she seemed to love it so that's all that matters to me.   My burger was the Piggy Butter and Jelly (again, I like to try weird things). It had a ground beef & ground bacon Burger with white american,  candied bacon, bread & butter pickles, peanut butter on the bottom and a  sweet habanero jelly. To my surprise, it was actually pretty good. The peanut butter and bacon complimented the burger very well. I liked the jelly but honestly I could have done without it.  My issue with this last visit was our waitress. She couldn't seem to understand that we didn't want to order our drinks until we were ready to order our food (my sister is very indecisive and we had literally just sat down so she wanted to see what they had to drink). So after asking at least five times if we were sure, she pretty much pressured my sister into ordering a coke (she does't like coke). Then when we went to order our burgers, I had missed the part where my burger was mixed with a ground bacon, so I had asked for my burger to be made with some pink in it. So she literally snaps at me and says they can't do that because there is pork in it. That wouldn't have been such a big deal to me had the people on both sides of us not heard it. But of course they did. And they stared (fun fact about ash, she hates when people stare at her for stupid reasons). But the whole time it just felt like she was rushing us. I get that you are busy and what not, but just let us enjoy our meal.   But like I said before, my opinion changes every time I go to a Burgatory (any of the locations). But I keep giving them chances and probably will continue to do so.  But anyway, this is definitely not the best burger place in Pittsburgh by far (Check out BRGR or Tessaro's), nor is it cheap. So make sure you do your homework before coming here.",

One nice feature is you can go on the waitlist through Yelp which I did. This probably saved me about a 20 minute wait. Place itself was nicely decorated and I thought the menu was narrow and to the point. This is a burger place they had several to offer. I ordered the elk burger which was delicious. We also got a Sonoma salad, regular burger, and a quesadilla. Everything was very good. Service was attentive and good without being annoying. They also have a bison burger I would try if I ever come back here.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner for the first time.  I ordered the trippin chicken burger with their in house made potato chips, hubby ordered a build a burger with house made chips and their caramel pretzel shake.  What's hot - Menu variety.  Their menu caters to a variety of dietary issues- vegetarian, grass fed beef, etc...  You may think I'm trippin, but they do have a veggie burger!  Pretty cool, especially cuz one of our family would've been able to join us, even though he gave up meat for Lent.  Don't knock it!  They also offer pretzel bread, which isn't common at many sandwich and burger joints.  Good shake options.  Unique side dishes.  Unique sauces, rubs, add one, etc... - Flavor.  Hubby liked his build a burger.  Good options.  Both our burgers had good flavor.  Not too overwhelming.  You can taste the flavor and the burgers are not greasy.  Just enough seasoning.  - Portions.  Goldilocks- not too much, not too little, just right. - Awesome chips.  Crispy and crunchy, but not greasy.  Well seasoned and not too salty. - Service. Everyone was nice, helpful, and attentive.  No complaints. - Location.  There are other shops and restaurants in the area, which helps if you'd like to do other things.  What's not - Happy hour specials start at 5pm, but they're only available at the bar.  Not cool.  Half off drinks and appetizers, which is a pretty good deal.  For example, hubby and I arrived a little before 5pm, so we thought we would take advantage of their happy hour specials.  Then the waitress clarified for us that their happy hour specials are only available at their bar.  I've been to many restaurants where their happy hour specials apply to all customers, regardless of where you sit. - Price.  You get what you pay for, but just be aware that the quality of food comes with a price.  For example, I was thinking of trying their egg and potato salad side, but it's an extra $3.  You also pay for certain options for their build a burger.  Again, be aware that you may be paying for extras. - Layout.  There's only a few booths and you have to be specific in asking for one, which hubby and I did not.  Otherwise, you're in the open and it's difficult to have a conversation.  Many tables for 2 are close together, which makes it difficult to have a conversation.  Sound carries in this restaurant.  Also difficult if you have a few belongings with you, cuz it's easy to get in the way of others.  Final answer Would come back again.",

I ordered the basic burger and paid the extra money for French fries instead of potato chips.  My friend didn't opt for the French fries and fully regretted that decision.  I ordered water for my drink.  My check for a basic burger and fries was $15.  I think the food vs. value failed for me.  I could have received the same food but more of it at 5 Guys which was in the same complex.",

I created my own burger with smoked gouda cheese and their truffle shallot aoli. I don't think I've ever had a more flavorful burger. I couldn't have made it more simple. Regular beef, brioche bun, lettuce, aoli, smoked gouda, and bacon.. but damn, that aoli just made everything blend together in one meaty, juicy, flavorful bite. I devoured it with a quickness. I was also impressed with their options; Elk burger, Kobe Beef, Crab patty.. you can pretty much create any burger combination you can think of. My one complaint, I think this place is WAY better than potato/sweet potato chips. They were ok, but they're pairing such a blah side to an incredible burger,   Since the shakes were so highly reviewed I HAD to try one... nutter butter shake was AWESOME. Thick, tons of flavor and perfectly balanced. It had a light crunch from the cookie pieces, thick and creamy ice cream, and a faint drizzle of caramel to make it just sweet enough to not think twice about your waistline.   Overall I was thoroughly impressed. Strongly recommended this as a travel food spot near all the hotels.",

This wasn't the first time but decided to try other things in the menu since it was the only place around the area with decent reviews. We came on Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was pretty full. We got seated really quick and our waiter was friendly. We ordered the crab salad, some rib dish and a swedish fish shake. The food took forever to come out and so did our glasses of water and the check.  The crab salad was okay but it didn't have much in it. The crab cake was actually pretty decent but the amount of veggies that they gave us was less than what the other dish came with and it was supposed to be a salad. The rib dish came with a lot of veggies and a little cup with the meat in it. It was cheesy and there wasn't much flavor which is why they give you gravy. The shake was pretty good and tasted like strawberry shortcake with pieces of swedish fish. I didn't really enjoy the food and wait but to their defense,  it is a burgers joint.",

I'm saying it didn't live up to the ridiculous amount of hype I've heard about it from friends, nor does it jusitfy waiting 1+ hrs. for a table.  They were packed.  The service was Meh.  The waitress was clearly super busy and they were understaffed, totally slammed, or both.  I got a burger and a shake. I got the \"Meat your Maker\" which was less than impressive.  Sure, it sounded like it would be great but it just wasn't the taste-bomb my mouth was expecting. My wife got some pot roasty burger thing that was better than my burger, but again, disappointed me.   Perhaps my expectations were set too high.  I'd take 5 guys over this any day.

We got there late, around 8:45, and we were seated immediately, although it was moderately busy. The craft beer selection was great, which my boyfriend really enjoyed. He was most excited about the Wagyu beef option for his burger (for those who don't know, Wagyu beef is supposedly the best kind of meat for a burger because of the high fat content and marbling, plus it is aged to perfection). He created his own burger with the Wagyu and I opted for the Farmer Brown, which featured a fried egg on an angus burger. Burgers are served with homemade chips, so no fries, which was a bummer. I didn't mind, because my burger was absolutely delicious! I'm not a huge red meat eater, but I devoured the whole thing!   My boyfriend had a completely different experience... He HATED his burger. I tasted it and the meat was gross. It felt like it was sand in your mouth and it was obviously not cooked slow enough. It left an awful taste in your mouth and overpowered all of the other toppings on the sandwich. He ate maybe a third of it before calling it quits. For paying top price for the Wagyu beef, he was very disappointed, and said he would pay more money at a more expensive restaurant to have it cooked correctly.   As for the other food, we had onion rings which were better than average, but the chips were just so-so. We ordered milkshakes at the end; I got the non-alcoholic PB&J, he got the Burnt Almond Torte Shake, which featured cake from Prantl's, amaretto, and vanilla vodka. He loved his, which redeemed his faith in the restaurant after his bad burger. Mine was meh... chunks of jelly in your mouth just tastes weird. I wish they would have blended fruit in instead of actual jelly. Or at least mix the peanut butter and jelly together before blending in the ice cream to make it smoother.   As for service, our waitress was mediocre and seemed to forget about us a little. I understood that it was close to closing time, but that's no reason to ignore your customers.   In all honesty, we most likely will not be going back.",

By no means am I a connoisseur of gourmet hamburgers, but this really was a major disappointment.  My \"pink\" burger was so dry and tasteless that I only ate about a 1/4 of it and boxed the remainder for my dog.   Hubby ordered the \"Meat your Maker\" and he also said it was terrible.  I've come to realize that I'm just a Wendy burger girl myself, they are always so fresh and the fries are the best.  I really don't like the idea of all those different toppings, somehow they drown out what should be the main star---the Burger itself!     Hubby also ordered the Bourbon milkshake but didn't care for all the whip cream that just wouldn't melt--it drowned out what should have been a delicious smooth drinking shake.  I'll take a Wendy's Frosty any day over this.",

The Truffled Gorgonzola Fries are amazing and the Bangkok Fries...The massive Portobello Mushrooms that they are...amazing! . I haven't had a bad entree or appetizer there yet.  The cocktails and service are another story. I've never seen a more cranky bunch of servers/bartenders in my life. I've tried all of their cocktails and I don't believe any of the Bartenders know how to make them; way too strong on the Alcohol with very little of the other ingredients, or it's the other way around. They also taste completely different each time: the Grape Refresher was anything but; the first serving all I could taste was Basil and Bottom Shelf Vodka. The second time, it was just a sour glass of Ginger Ale and Lemon. The Deuce's Wild Mint Lemonade was like drinking a Gin Martini with a splash of Lemon.  The Bartenders are more interested in their phones and their coworkers than the customers while their attitude leaves a lot to be desired. They also know nothing about their beers and cocktails; asking what type of IPAs they have on tap shouldn't be met with a blank look and pointing at the taps and when asked for a cocktail recommendation, you hear \"Uh. I don't know...\" and they walk away.   In the end, call in your order and if you sit at the bar, expect crappy service if you aren't a friend of the Bartender. Four stars for the food (fries have the potential to be soggy when you get them home) and no stars for the service.",

There were so many burger options that I ended up with the crab cake sandwich, only without the sriracha remoulade. When my my sandwich came it had the sauce on it. Once I got my server's attention, she took it back and brought a new sandwich. It was temperature hot but had a slight kick of flavor, could've been the chip flavoring though.",

The restaurant seemed clean but was very cold inside. Not sure if it was because we were seated by the door. Bathroom clean and updates but small. Prices average.

    "text": "When Burgatory first game out, it was a game changer. Organic food? Bison burgers? Elk burgers? Incredibly amazing shakes?   First, let's look at the good: Only once have I not had an amazing meal there. You are also able to create your burger, which is something you don't normally see. With tons of options like the 50/50 burger (half ground meat, half bacon) and a crab burger, tons of spices and sauces to add, choices of buns, and tons of toppings to choose from, it's a winning situation for everyone. While you can't make reservations, the waiting time has gone down significantly in the past couple of years. There's an unfortunate reason for that one, though.  Now for the downside: Since of the opening of the restaurant, the prices have gone through the roof. Are you looking for a milkshake? That will be $6.50, please. No, seriously. For a milkshake. If you want a burger with cheese (because cheese is extra and some other toppings are, too) you're looking at a $13 - $17 price tag. Burgatory used to have these amazing chips; half Idaho potato and half sweet potato. The sweet potatoes are all but gone. Oh, and lest we forget, fries are extra. When all is said and done, if you and a date want a burger and shake, it's going to cost about $50, which is most likely why the line no longer goes out the door anymore.",

(That and, let's be real, out of all the places to eat in the Waterfront Burgatory's one of the best - so everyone wants to eat there!)  Like its sister location, this Burgatory carries the famous Burgatory custom burger option while also offering a menu full of fries, sandwiches, and even salads that you can order, too. However, while I've mentioned some dissatisfaction with the quality of beef burger I've gotten at the Waterfront, I admit that I haven't really put this location to the test yet beef-wise. This is because I usually end up eating here when they have a special milkshake that I just MUST have, right now, before they disappear, because oh my Lord is anything better than a Burgatory milkshake... But since shakes with alcohol can't be taken home, I've started ordering salads with my boozy milkshakes since they're easier to take home. Yep, I'm that person who orders salad at a burger joint. Sorry - not sorry!  The exception to my \"milkshake and salad\" rule here was when I stopped in to try the Thanksgiving turkey burger recently. OMG. I told a friend that the Gobblerito has met its match in this burger, and I meant it. Every Thanksgiving \"must\" had been crammed onto that meal, and it was the one time I ended up eating my burger with a fork rather than my hands. After eating that delicious monstrosity, I'm honestly ready to come back and eat more burgers...well played, Burgatory. Well played.  Anyway, my final thought on this location is, if you like Burgatory in general, you'll like it here. They make AMAZING milkshakes, as we've come to expect from Burgatory. The burgers can also be quite amazing - although I'd honestly recommend a salad even more than a burger, if you're looking to get your money's worth. Even the hungriest diner probably won't be able to finish those massive salads. So go ahead: stop on in and justify your milkshake order with a big ol' salad to go with it!",

    "text": "This place probably doesn't need another review, but I have to at least add my five stars. It was the best damn burger I've ever had. The whole place is brilliant: A thorough, clever, hilarious concept carried through from the building exterior to the little red devil's pitchfork through the center of the burger. There is serious attention to detail in this place, and not just in the aesthetics, but also in the food. I could not believe that my medium-done (\"pink\") burger didn't bleed all the way through the bun, didn't fall apart, didn't drip cheese all over the place, didn't soak the onion straws on it... These people are paying attention not just to flavor and doneness and mouthfeel, but to how the WHOLE thing works together, how easy it is to eat, etc.  I made my own burger, my friend got the \"Meat Your Maker\" and raved about it from beginning to end. Also the best burger he's ever had.  The fries are tiny (in length) but huge on flavor. The chips, I'm pretty sure, are homemade, slightly thicker than Lay's, with good body, perfectly salted.  We got a pretzel milkshake and thought it was perfectly sweet (not too much, not too little) and beautifully thick--but not so thick you couldn't get it through a straw.  If it's any indication: We left there at 9 pm on a Sunday night. Burgatory was still so backed up people were waiting half an hour for a table. Four doors down, the 5 Guys was E-M-P-T-Y. And rightfully so. I can't see that place lasting another 6 months with Burgatory right next door.  We drove 5 hours from Blacksburg, Virginia to visit Pittsburgh this weekend, and on the way back, we had this conversation multiple times:  \"Dude, we should totally take one day over the summer and drive up to Pittsburgh, eat at Burgatory, then just drive back down.\"  \"Let's do it.\"  [1 hour later:]  \"They should build one of those Japanese bullet trains straight from Virginia Tech to the Burgatory in Pittsburgh. I would totally go there at least once a week.\"  \"Dude, we'll just drive up there.\"  [1 hour later:]  \"I'm hungry.\"  \"Let's go back and hit the Burgatory one more time. Come on!\"  \"Dude, I have GOT to finish my thesis. But over the summer, for sure.\"  \"What we need is a Japanese bullet train.\"  \"Totally.\"  You get the idea.   You people who live there: I envy you.  You people bitching about the wait: Shut up already, you spoiled, whiny babies. Whip out your cell phones and entertain yourselves for all of 30 minutes.   I WOULD DRIVE TEN HOURS JUST FOR A BURGATORY BURGER  AND  I  WOULD  BE  HAPPY  ABOUT  IT  ! ! !",

The mixed drinks are strong, so beware if you are a lightweight like me!  The milkshakes are delicious (and you can get \"adult\" versions that are spiked), but I never have room for one after I'm done eating. I've found that getting 1 or 2 milkshakes for a table of 4-6 tends to be more than enough for everyone. The restaurant itself has a great design- LOVE the design of the menus and the wall graphics, etc. Friendly and relatively fast service - no complaints here! Lots of parking, too.",

    "text": "You know that good puke feeling you sometimes get...when you stuff your face with so much awesomeness that your stomach doesn't have time to catch up and tell your brain to stop eating or you'll explode awesomeness everywhere...well my Burgatory experience was something like that.  But thankfully I didn't explode but felt like I was going to but in the good kinda way.    All I had previously heard about Burgatory was the awesome burgers and shakes so this is what I was determined to try.  I sat at the bar - there was no wait - and ordered the caramel pretzel shake.  How its even possible to capture pure ecstasy in the form of a shake I'll never know, but that's what it was!  It had pieces of crunchy (not soggy) pretzels throughout and with the subtle sweetness of caramel.    I should mention that I restrained myself from inhaling the shake because I had a burger coming that I also wanted to savor.  So after a few large sips, I pushed it to the side anxiously waiting for my custom burger.  Beef patty with peppercorn rub, bourbon bbq, smoke gouda, grilled 'shrooms, arugula and tomato on a wheat bun.    As you can imagine, I felt like I was in Burgatory purgatory waiting for my burger while restraining my whole body from downing the shake.  So after about 20 minutes, I was getting a bit impatient but I told myself to calm the heck down.  But then I noticed that the girl who sat next to me at the bar, but arrived 10 minutes after I did, got her burger.  Then there was a couple across the bar who must have arrived 15-20 minutes after I did who got their food.  At this point it must have been 35-40 minutes with no burger.  My will power to stop drinking the shake had diminished about 20 minutes before so the shake was nearly done.    Now here's a situation which had the potential to be an awful experience and a potential 1-2 star Yelp rating.  But this is how it was saved!  The manager came up to me and apologized for the delay in my food and that she would make sure it comes out as soon as possible.   About 10 minute later, there was my burger all ready for me to eat.  I was told by the waitress that their computer system had crashed right when they entered the order so it must have never gone through.    The manager came to check on me to make sure everything was ok and I said that it was.  She then told me that my whole meal was on them!  Wow - now that's customer service.  While there was a part of me that felt entitled to at least have them discount or comp the burger, I didn't expect them to take care of the shake as well.  To me that was way beyond my expectations but made me really like this place all that much more.      The burger and shake were fantastic and I highly recommend checking this place out.  I know I will!  I wish I could have left them an awesome tip but didn't have any cash on me so the next time I go I'll be extra generous with my tip!  I mean really it has to be a sin to eat food that good and not pay for it!",

We did find the chicken burger a bit of a let down but hey its a burger place.    Our favorite milkshake is the carmel pretzel but on one or two occasions its been way too salty.  We asked and they happily replaced it.  The other milkshakes are great too and they can add liquor to any shake. Great beer list too (not huge but quality craft beers).    One piece of advice is go early and/or with time flexibility.  They'll text you ten minutes before the table is ready so we usually go back home or do some shopping/people watching at Walmart.",

The food here is PHENOMENAL mostly because you can create your own burger using whatever fine ingredients you like. Smoked Gouda cheese is a good choice.

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Sunday around noon for lunch with my fiance.  I have been to Burgatory before but not in a long time and never to this location.  As we were walking towards the front door of the place we noticed that they have quite a nice outdoor seating area.  We were seated immediately upon walking in the door but I noticed that there was only one other table free.  That table also quickly filled up and by the time that we left there were many groups of people waiting for a table.  The inside of the restaurant has a sleek and industrial feeling with a bar and a number of TV's near the tail end of the restaurant which is next to the outdoor seating and then the bulk up the main seating near the front with a fun flow chart on the wall.  For my lunch entree I ordered the make you own burger for which they have order forms on the table which you complete using their check boxes.  There are about 7 section with the first section being the meat you want, second bun, third cheese, fourth sauces, etc.  I ended up choosing the hormone free beef (cooked pink) with peppercorn crust on a whole wheat bun topped with siracha remoulade, cheddar, banana peppers, poblano peppers, dill chips and romaine lettuce.  Their burgers also come with a side of chips which you can upgrade to a better side for a little more money.   I chose to do that with the quinoa salad.  Our meals came out within a reasonable time period complete with devil pitch fork holding the hamburgers together and they looked good.  My burger was cooked as ordered and I enjoyed the taste of the patty.  What was disappointing with it was that the siracha remoulade had no discernible spice to it and the flavor of my cheese got lost in the myriad flavors of the burger.  I can't say too much about the latter though as I did choose all of the toppings myself.  The real winner of my lunch actually ended up being the quinoa salad.  It consisted of red quinoa, green/red/yellow bell peppers, pineapple and surprisingly some lemon juice which added the perfect amount of acidity to make the salad really enjoyable.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The food was good, especially the meat for the burger and quinoa salad, and I love the number of different toppings available for the build your own burger.",

My husband said his crab burger was really bland and underwhelming. He said there was supposed to siriacha sauce, which he assumed would give it a little bit of a kick, but he didn't taste any heat at all. The other three people in our party said the same thing; the food was bland, boring, forgettable, and underwhelming.   Most surprisingly to me was that our party said the place was way too loud, and they didn't enjoy the atmosphere. Considering one of our party goes to rather noisy places on a regular basis and one speaks very loudly, I was shocked to hear them say the place was so unpleasantly loud to them.   Overall this was not a good experience, and my husband didn't even get take out for me from Burgatory. My husband was unimpressed with his visit and won't be going back; it certainly wasn't an experience worth the approximately $60 he spent.  No, we would not recommend this place to others.  EDIT TO ADD RESPONSE FROM BURGATORY : Nichole,   We greatly appreciate you taking the time to tell us about their experience. We're sorry to hear they were unimpressed during their visit. We believe that one of the reasons we're such a busy little joint is because we love serving great food. Obviously, we did a poor job showing them that. We share all feedback, good and bad, with the entire crew and we assure you these concerns will be discussed. Thank you again for sharing their thoughts.   Sincerely,  The Crew @ Burgatory",

They knew, that if they could manage to spin it into an addictively good milkshake with vanilla vodka and amaretto, that I'd likely be hooked... and they were right.  Add this to an Elk burger that was ACTUALLY JUICY (not a dried out brick like a lot of other places serve) and well done sweet potato chips, and you have for one awesome gut bomb of a meal (be ready to take a nap after this one).  I had reservations after having a Burgatory burger that left a lot to desire from their Consol Energy Center location, but I was honest with myself that it wasn't likely a good representation of the real deal...  I was correct as well.  I'm not exactly sure what my favorite burger in the burgh is now...  but it's definitely a tie between here or Winghart's!",

Now I wish I had discovered Burgatory earlier, as there is so much more than beef on this menu. We stopped by on a Sunday night and found them very busy, so we nabbed the last two remaining barstools and avoided the half hour wait. According to the very helpful bar staff, this is usual for Sunday night at this location...they let us know it's their busiest night of the week, so heads up on that. The woman who waited on us was great at helping us to decipher the menu. She explained everything clearly and was quick to point our some of her favorites. I like that you can put your own meal together from the list provided...my husband took advantage of that fun feature to create his own masterpiece. I went with a regular menu burger that sounded great; the Elk Gone Wild, which is an elk burger \"Diablo dusted\" and topped with gouda, caramelized onion marmalade, bacon jam and tomato vinaigrette tossed arugula. I opted to get mine sans the bun and switched to a side salad for a $1.50 upgrade. This burger was delicious, with more than just a hint of spice from the Diablo dust, a nice sweetness from the caramelized onion marmalade and a little bit of smokiness from the bacon jam. I had asked for some of the tomato vinaigrette to go with my side salad, and the dressing was terrific. The side salad was also very substantial, with some pumpkin seeds, parmesan cheese and oven roasted tomatoes finishing it off. Overall a very delicious and, dare I say, nutritious meal. I was happy to discover that one can eat a  healthy, well balanced meal at this restaurant...or you can go for one of their shakes and really indulge. Next time I may try a salad, or even the veggie burger, as they also sounded really good. Good food thoughtfully prepared, excellent service and, if you sit at the bar, a great place to watch a game.",

    "text": "I love the truffle fries!  I would get it without the Gorgonzola because it makes it really salty - or you can ask for it on the side.  I love the burgers, but the only problem is that it makes the buns soggy.  That's good, because that's one juicy burger, but also one soggy bun.  I always get the chips, and get the burger sauce/dressing on the side so I use it a a dipping sauce!  The smore's milkshake is also pretty good, and to me, I think it's meant for sharing.  There's so much!  And I also love the cherry coke float (in the kid's menu, hehe)",

    "text": "I got a burger and skipped the shake.  I just couldn't see the value in buying a shake from a place that heavily advertised that I could get my shake with alcohol.  I drink, mind you, but when I think milkshake, I DON'T think drinking.  That's not to say they aren't good, but it is to say that they talked me out of it.  Which leads me to the theme of this place.  It's obnoxious.  Their \"sinfully good\" slogan is obnoxious.  Their ugly decorations are obnoxious.  The upscale feel for a BURGER JOINT is obnoxious, and the price you're paying for a BURGER is really obnoxious.  That said, the burger was pretty good.  It was also pretty small, and the burger plus chips (for almost $12) left me wanting to eat more.  Also, not the best burger I've ever had.  By no means bad, just not incredible.  But let me be clear... under no circumstances was it worth what I paid for it.  They give you a lot of expensive packaging and spend a lot on their obnoxious advertising, and that is what you are paying for.  I'd like to think I can be smarter with my dollar.  Their sides add nothing to the experience either.  I had homemade chips which were pretty good, but they didn't do anything to quell my hunger.    The service was lacking.  I sat at the bar for over 5 minutes before someone even noticed me.  After a while, I was told I had to go elsewhere to order take out (which made no sense to me).  The lady who took my order was helpful and pleasant.  Yet overall, I walked away feeling I had a less than desirable experience.  Bottomline:  You can do better.  If you're in the mood for a burger, go right around the corner (LITERALLY... same strip mall and everything) and go to Five Guys.  It tastes better, it's cheaper, it's a better value, and they aren't anywhere near as... you guessed it... obnoxious.",

I had the aged Wyagu beef with a cracked peppercorn rub, egg, bacon, onion straws, cheese, all on a wheat bun.  Homemade chips are the side.  I asked for the burger to be rare and it came medium rare, but I'll let that go this time.  This is one damn good burger.  You won't be disappointed or hungry afterwards.  Actually I may need to take a nap.  We also ordered the Morty's Steakhouse burger and the Phat Patti's Veggie Burger.  No one was disappointed.  We will definately be ordering again and again.

Great name and a Devilish cow to entice you in.  We kind of felt that we had to check out since they were touted such a name.  Much to our skeptical surprise we loved it.  We both had Beef Burgers and they simply rocked.  The fried were fresh and tasty too.  I had an alcoholic milkshake and my only complaint was the size of the straw.  You could park your motorhome in this thing if you wanted to!   We went back the next day and I got the crab burger....not as great as the beef, but still a solid sandy.  I am super critical when it comes to burgers, and I have to say their beef burgers ranked very high on my list.   Rock On Devil Cow!",

It has all the goodness of a PB&J sandwich without the mouth stickiness of peanut butter...best thing ever!  I went with one of their house burgers this time and it was flavorful, cooked perfectly, and much better than the elk burger I had had at the other Burgatory location.

I really liked the theme and the restaurant gave off a nice inviting vibe. I opted to create my own burger which was not as easy as it sounds. I liked that I was able to use their handy paper checklist to record what I wanted (no mistakes!). The options were endless but it can definitely get a little pricey depending on how fancy you decided to get. The burgers come with homemade chips but you can get fries for an upcharge. I went with chips and they were pretty good. The only thing that was difficult was determining the type of sauce to put on the burger. They all sounded really good but there's no way of really knowing how they taste (maybe I could have asked for samples?). I also opted for the salted caramel pretzel shake. It was pretty good but lacked the caramel flavor. Probably wouldn't get it again but I would try another shake. Okay, so back to the burger. It came out and it was really good!! Overall, I really enjoyed Burgatory and would love to go back. I've been to other restaurants where you build a burger but not like Burgatory. There are so many options from the type of meat (veggie/vegan options!!), bun options (or lettuce wraps), and endless toppings and cheeses. LOVE!",

Omg my burger was cooked perfect and idk how to describe it but the beef was so flavorful I really almost didn't  need any toppings the beef burger alone was so good.

We all pretty much got a burger made to order our way . I am not a big burger guy but everyone seemed to enjoy and the price was not bad .",

    "text": "This was our third time at this restaurant and we loved it and had so much fun! Our server was Tami who was attentive, super nice and came to check on us often.   We checked in online (which I highly recommend, especially with kids!) and only sat down for a good 5 minutes. We were sat close to the door, which was good for an active toddler to look around.   We ordered the fork it fries with the gravy on the side for an appetizer. It wasn't exactly what we were expecting. It would have been better with fried cheese curds and some nacho cheese or shredded cheese instead of the gravy.   I made my own burger and my husband ordered the meat your maker burger and the chicken strip meal for the toddler. Once I started to eat my burger I noticed it had some pink in it (I did specify that I wanted no pink, because I'm pregnant). They quickly remade my burger with many apologies and the burger was amazing!   We each had a shake and an ice cream treat for the toddler for finishing his meal.   It is a little pricey but the quality of the food and experience are so well worth it!",

I had the wagyu beef burger selection \"Meat  your Maker\" . Sauces and cheese, beef all excellent and cooked perfect. The side option I chose of the beans was only thing disappointing... cold when dinner arrived.  I would kill some sides and add broccoli or sweet potato tots or fried caramelized  Brussels spouts ... I have elsewhere and a tasty healthy side with a burger... Next time the bison burger on the pretzel bun. Great meal! And ice cold yuengling drafts. Service at bar was low key, attentive and great.",

The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because the bartenders didn't really seem to communicate, each time one girl would ask what we wanted to drink, do we want our check, etc. the other one would ask. Other than that it was perfect !!!",

Like other burger places, heavy on the toppings and the bun is 3 sizes to big...but if you can find the meat, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  We visited Burgatory on a Saturday night at 6pm and ended up waiting 2 hours (literally), and our expectations were a little high.  I chose a burger off the menu while my boyfriend built his own so we could have a mix of things to try. I really wanted my meal to live up to expectations (and maybe my expectations were too high, coming from having many made-to-order burger joints to choose from in NYC).  Overall the quality is very good, but it just seems like everyone is enamored by the toppings; however the overall burger just didn't do it for me.",

I have to avoid them at all costs unless elastic jeans come in to style.  If you go to any Burgatory please be prepared for a wait.    Service - Great - Our order was taken right away and we did not have to wait long for our food. Cost - More expensive than Five Guys (which is almost next door - a good backup burger place if you cannot wait) Atmosphere - Very similar to their Waterworks vacation.    It can get noisy at times.

It wasn't very good, it is a nice place and all the people that work there that we talked to were very nice and helpful. The selections on the menu all look good but that is where it ended. We ordered a couple of appetizers and  a burger, I customized a burger and I went with the hormone free beef on a potato bun with cheddar, the first thing I noticed was that the bun wasnt soft like every other potato bun I've ever had anywhere and the burger wasnt very flavorful at all, maybe I was supposed to have add a seasoning dust, Wendy's has a better burger. We also got the fork it and the Adam's oh no you didn't dip, the fork it was the best thing we had but it was supposed to have cheese curds and I think there might have been two or three buried in the bottom of the dish. The dip was just ok but was very smoky and I'm not sure why since the menu didn't mention it being smoky, it also said horseradish but I didn't taste it. Overall I'm glad we tried it but we'll stick to 5 guys and the next time someone says to me that 5 guys is expensive I'll show them my Burgatory receipt.",

The staff is excellent, the setting just right, and the food was beyond what I could have hoped for!   When I arrived for dinner at 7 pm on a Friday night, it was crowded and close to an hour wait. I downloaded an app though that alerted me how many groups were in front of me and that was super helpful. The wait ended up being only 25 minutes! We were seated and waited on efficiently. There is a custom creation check-off sheet which made it super easy to get what you wanted how you wanted it. I ordered a simple barbecue chicken sandwich and it turned out amazing! I recommend ordering a milkshake to go instead of with your meal, or else you may end up uncomfortably full. At the end of my dinner, I ordered a caramel pretzel milkshake, weary how the combination of flavors would taste, and it turned out amazing. The next day, I was just craving for another caramel and pretzel shake!   I was traveling out of state and the Burgatory has been on my mind since I got home. But next time I am traveling towards Pittsburgh, I am looking forward to go to this amazing burger place!",

The burgers can be created to your specs. I got a classic burger. Mouth watering and very juicey. The service was very good and everyone was friendly. You can eat outside if you like as well. The price was reasonable. Its a gourmet burger experience that is very special.",

    "text": "I have heard about Burgatory since moving to Pittsburgh almost two years ago and finally got around to trying it.  I was glad that it lived up to all the hype I had heard.    I love the signage and decor inside.  It was fun reading all the quotes and looking around.  You are missing out if you come here to eat and don't try one of the milkshakes.  In fact, I'd come for a repeat visit just for the shakes they were that good.  My husband had a daily special shake - pretzel jello.  It was a summer dessert with a fun (and boozy) twist.  I had the apple pancake and bacon shake.  It was divine.  The waitress warned me that it had bits of bacon and some people don't like that.  It made me even more intrigued and once I tried it, made it just that much more delictable.  After much internal debate, I tried the Meat Your Maker burger.  It had wagyu beef, onions, cheese and was intensely flavorful.  My husband chose to make a custom burger and really enjoyed his creation as well.    We shared the \"just fork it\" appetizer - a poutine style dish with fries with short ribs, cheese curds and gravy.  It was wonderful.  It was so filling, I could have ordered just that.  Service was attentive and friendly.    I can't wait until the Murraysville location opens so I have a location to visit that is closer to home.",

EVERY time I was here we were suppose to get a text message when our table was ready, it never happened anytime. When I finally complained  this time, after tables that arrived after us were seated, I was seated right away with a quick \"sorry\" .  It is EXTREMELY loud so much that my 6 year old said so.  It is pricy, but I have never been mad at paying for a good meal with great service. However this will be our last time here.  The bottom line is that if you want a pricy good burger, to not being able to hear your date across the table, with a wait no matter the time of day and then sub-par service than this is the place for you!",

When asked, \"we have no reservations or call ahead seating\" per the iPad riveted hostesses. When pressed, \"well you could download the NoWait app to check in.\" \"Isn't that called a reservation or at least a call-ahead seating?\" I was derisively told \"no, it's an app?\"  In my opinion the food was at best mediocre and over-priced (10 hamburgers on the menu with average price of $11.40).  We received heavy pressure from wait staff for \"upgrades\" ... from the chips which come along side of these $11.40 burgers (chips appeared made in house and were grease-laiden and burnt) as well as for milkshakes and appetizers.  $8 milkshakes; to quote Pulp Fiction, \"that better be a good shake\" (in this movie, that was for a $5 shake.)  I have had the good fortune to travel throughout the states to eat at the complete spectrum of eateries. Burgatory for me, does not make the cut. There will be no return visits.",

I like to try the pre-made burgers to evaluate the chefs and I was not disappointed. I had the Meat Your Maker and it was amazing. All burgers come with free chips with other sides like fries, baked beans etc for an up charge. Good craft beer selection and great staff. The decor is also quite nice. Trendy & cool but not snooty. My only complaint... No Pretzel buns.  Also they should add Poutine to the menu. I'm not Canadian but I know this place needs Poutine. Finally I had to try a milk shake I didnt go for an alcohol induced milk shake which was probably a mistake but I had the Salted Carmel Nutella shake and it was delicious. My second suggestion would be to add Malts to the Shake menu. I will certainly be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Loved it.",

But seriously, if you really want to enjoy a night out and have some delicious food, just go.   **Use the No-Wait app to put your name in prior to leaving. The only thing you may be disappointed with is the wait (because it is that great.)  Finally, my favorite shakes in order, if you're questioning which to get:  1) Salted Caramel Pretzel 2) Fluffer Nutter Butter 3) Coffee & Donuts 4) Choco's Taco (without alcohol) 5) Salted Nutella Crunch 6) S'mores   (And S'mores is still absolutely amazing...)",

Yeah they have homemade chips, rosemary fries, jalapeno corn bread, and baked beans but... after a dozen meals... the chips are too bland and hard, fries are over the top and steal the show from the burger (sometimes so soggy and saturated they are inedible), cornbread is good but you better like jalapenos, beans are trying too hard.  I just want a starchy filler. Beer batter fries, less grandiose onion rings... just something to send me home stuffed and not regretting eating that... other thing that came with the burger.",

    "text": "Well, it seems one can not write a Burgatory review without writing paragraphs!!  Perhaps the reviews are started during the 30-40 minute waits for a table!  My review will be short as the reviews that I see here are highly consistent with my experience.   As long as the wait is, the microbrew beers are outstanding and make the wait pass easily. We also ordered the portabella fries ... Outstanding batter ... Very light ... And the mushroom was tender and well- seasoned and delicious. The sliders were good and so were the lacey onion fries ... Not greasy and very satisfying.    The burgers do take awhile to come but even after we were seated we finished the beer and appetizers ... This is not a painful way to pass the time while waiting!    Note, they refuse, quite amusingly, to take an order for \"medium well\" or \"medium\". Your chooses, so to speak, are red, pink, or brown-well. No amount of coaxing would move them to make it to a different label. In any event, the pink is close to medium and medium well, and was juicy-moist and yet probably meets FDA cooking standards.   Service is eager, bouncy and friendly at the front, bar, and table ...  You'll get great service throughout your visit. We were there on a Tuesday, and as crowded as it was at 730, we were all but alone at 900 or 930.",

    "text": "When I'm going fast casual and thinking of a burger, I'm a Five Guy kinda guy. So I'm happy I wandered out of my comfort zone and into Burgatory.   Like other yelpers stated, the wait for a table is long. We were quoted a 45-minute wait ... on a Sunday at 2pm! But don't let this deter you from going; it takes some work to get into Heaven. There a ton of stores located around this space and they have an incredible texting system that alerts you when your table is ready and you can check in to their site and see how many guest are ahead of your spot. While we waited, we went to Wal-Mart and did our weekly grocery shopping and return with only 4 people ahead of our spot on the list.   The hostesses weren't overly friendly like noted by other yelpers, but who cares? I'd sacrifice a manufactured smile for efficiency any day. It's a daunting task seating this many needy guests and you got to stay focused. With that said, I didn't know there was a bar at this location until we were seated! If we were told so when we checked in, I'd of elected to drink away our wait than shop for groceries.  On the other hand, our server, Marisa, was very personable and friendly. For as busy as she was I was amazed at her attention to detail and she seemed genuinely determined to enhancing our experience.   I got the Morty's Steakhouse burger - peppercorn and horseradish are two of my favorite things. I ordered it medium rare or 'pink' as Marisa confirmed. Unfortunately, it came out well done. If this had occurred at Tessaro's or any restaurant above fast casual, the burger would have been sent back. However, It's my feeling that these fast casual establishments don't want to cook a medium rare for a myriad of reasons. At an establishment like this you tend to sacrifice quality for convenience. With that said, it was the best damn well done burger I ever had... dry, but good.   As a side I received cold, hard sliced potato chips. I got the feeling due to the high volume of business they were fried well ahead of time and I got the bottom of the pan. But, I shouldn't even be eating them, so no harm. I hope when I return to Burgatory they will offer an alternative, non-fried side like potato salad or coleslaw, especially for the summer season. You can only have so much sin, which leads me to.....  Heavenly Shakes! Before we even ordered our burgers, it was determined what milkshakes we'd be ordering to-go. This is the way to go... eat your burgers there, skip the fried sides, and take a milkshake home! I got the Carmel Pretzel and my friend got the Coffee & Donuts. Just amazing.  Four stars may seem generous for a burger place that couldn't even cook the right temperature for a burger, but Burgatory exceeded my (low) expectations. From top to bottom, the menu is creative and original. This is a well-run business that put much thought and effort into guest convenience and enhancing their experience.",

We are vegetarians, so we really appreciate a good housemade veggie burger and they've got it.  We've had the nachos too (minus the chicken chili) and they were good, but had just a few too many green peppers.  All in all, it was very good and we'll be back again.",

My first experience 2years ago was bad and I decided to give it another try. My boyfriend and I were having a rough week after the loss of our best friend. After a very emotional day we didn't want to cook. Our server was sam, who didn't seem to happy to be there.. We filled out the create your own slips have them to her and then He ordered a chocotaco milkshake to start I wasn't given the chance to order one because she took the menu and walked away. Milkshake got dropped off a little while later but no chance to order one.. Our food came and it looked great. I had the veggie option with smoked Gouda garlic mayo lettus tomato grilled onions and pickles. I may have forgotten to mark pickles but wanted them so I waved the girl down and asked if I could get some.. She rolled her eyes  and we never saw her again till we wanted our checks.. The pickles were dropped off by someone else which I was just happy to get them.. Our food was very good. When she brought our checks she then asked you didn't want a milkshake right?...  I said no.. Because at that point I was ready to pay and leave.. Like I said the food was good but the attitude atmosphere was terrible..  She never came back to see if our food tastes good or if we needed anything else.. I guess if you want the food maybe order take out.. I waited a few days to write the review knowing that I had a rough day.. But there's no change..I didn't make her go to work that day but I didn't go out for dinner to go home feeling like this..",

It was my first visit and I loved many aspects of the design and feel of the place. Hip, modern, cool. Love the pads where you check off what you want on the burger.  Lately, I feel like I have been seeing a lot of servers trying to pull off the memorization approach, and failing. Disappointing for all involved. So why not put it in writing?  Though I eat meat, I was in a healthy kind of mood and got the Phat Patti burger. While all the ingredients were tasty, the patty started falling apart nearly on first bite, getting progressively worse through the meal. I ended up eating it with a fork after it completely disintegrated. Good ingredients, but the execution could be optimized. The chips that came with the burger were delish. And, of course, those milkshakes. Again, at the tail end of a week of birthday celebrations, I couldn't imagine eating one more bite than I did, but I've heard they're great, and will stop by again to try more of the offerings.",

There is no call ahead option nor will they take reservations, but they will take your cell # when you arrive and text you when your table is ready. There are a few shops in the same strip (like Game Stop), so maybe you can go next door and play some sample games to kill some time.   The build your own burger is becoming more popular, and I think Burgatory does it just about as well as any I've seen. There are options for thousands of different burger combinations. Our waitress offered a few suggestions to help me finish off my creation. I love that they give you a notepad with the checklist to make your picks. I've been places where you just had to rattle off your selections to the server and that is difficult when you're getting crafty.  I had my burger on a baguette, which was not as crispy as a traditional baguette, but it'd be pretty hard to eat a burger off something like that. I was pleased with the bread choice though because it didn't get soggy under the weight of all the extras and sauces I had selected.  The milkshakes are really good, and I think they do a good job with their fries, too. The milkshakes are big, too. You get almost two full glasses since they give you the steel mix cup, too. One of these burgers and a milkshake will fill you up, so consider sharing or pacing yourself! Oh, and any of the \"adult\" milkshakes can be made without booze or you can add booze to a regular shake.",

I don't, if ever write reviews especially really bad ones but this is needed. This is about the Robinson Twp location only. Today my wife, her mother and myself ordered three burgers. Two impossible burgers for my wife and I and a beef burger for my mother in law. Service was great and accommodating to my mother in law (partially blind). Food came out at an appropriate time but the two impossible burgers were ice cold! Not heat reduced to room temp, but ice cold. The cheese was also cold and unmelted. I have worked enough restaurant's to know when any food items that look that cooked but temp that cold were pre-cooked then put in a cold table on the cook line (like Subway). I sent it back, my wife likes cold burgers so she nibbled. After everyone was finished I got my hot burger. I wrapped it to go. I get home, heat it up, take a bite.... pure salt!!! It was the worst of all the impossible burgers I've had. Took a bite of my wife's burger, not bad. So it seems I pissed off the cooks because I busted them pre-cooking impossible burgers to save time. Oh well, many other places now offer impossible burgers cooked with the respect it and customers deserve.",

    "text": "While \"make your own burger\" might not be a unique idea, Burgatory's Custom Creation is a great take on the old idea.    Start by selecting your burger, from Hormore Free Beef to Dry Aged Wagyu (with chicken, bison, crab, and veggie in between).  Then, pick a bun - I went Naked! Relax, that just means no bun.  From there, \"pick a rub\", \"get cheezy\", and \"sauce it up\" to your likening.  Of course, no burger is complete without toppings.  The \"No Buck Toppings\" are pretty generous and you can grab up to four for free.  They also have \"$1 Buck Toppings\", such as grilled pineapple and maple cured ham, if you want to go a bit more adventurous.  Finally, have it cooked either red, pink, or no pink.  No, Burgatory was not the best burger of my life.  However, it was very tasty and made exactly the way I wanted.  And while the wait was a bit longer than we anticipated, it was clear they care about their customers and service once seated was prompt.  I'd return if I make it make to the area and recommend if you are local you at least check it out once...",

Their shakes are okay, once in awhile I'll get one but they're nothing special in my opinion. I was slightly disappointed with my experience last night. It started out great. My friend and I sat at the bar we didn't want to wait an hour when they had plenty of tables opened,which I hate about that place.  We waited for our check for close to an hour. Finally we had to yell for our check then I hardly had drank my shake and I had to wait 10 more minutes and yell for a to go cup. The last half of my experience is why I only gave this place 3 stars for crap service . Food is 5 stars.",

My husband had the elk on the range. He said it was very tasty, but unexpectedly spicy, but that was because he didn't read the menu properly.  The patty is dusted in Diablo powder.

They arrived hot and crispy. They were huge!  They came with 2 dipping sauces-a spicy ketchup and a horseradish dip. Both were tasty and everyone loved both sauces.  I chose to make my own burger so I grabbed one of the pads of order forms and started checking off my choices. I will say that Burgatory used to have a sauce that I loved but they changed up their menu and the sauce didn't get chosen to stay. I love it though that you get to choose how your burger is served. I choose to go Naked-no bun. Their brioche bun is good but to change things up I go naked. I ordered bacon and it was cooked perfectly. The garlic aioli was wonderful. I also had cheddar cheese, romaine lettuce, and dill pickles. It was all very tasty. I picked the house chips which are made fresh. I like to order a side of house sauce to dip my chips in. It looks like Russian dressing but tastes way better. It was a great meal and I enjoyed watching my friends make their choices and then try them. We made one mistake though . . . We didn't leave room for a milkshake. Make sure you do!",

I think they just recently changed the shape of their fries.. they are no longer those skinny - tiny fries they are the regular size. The one thing that I don't care for is the seating setup.  Everyone is practically sitting on top of one another. When I go out to eat it's an experience.  I do not wish to sit 2 inches away from a stranger while I am trying to have a conversation with the party I am with.   The restaurant is a bit noisy for my taste and wish there were more booths and tables that aren't so close together.   Other than this reason I love the food and will return - but will sit at the bar or a high top table.",

Half so-so, and half really good.    In general I'd say my so-so experiences are characterized by an overdone, dry burger.  That's a pretty big deal for a place in Burgatory's price point, selling gourmet versions of the Five Guys burger next door.  I mean, what's to keep you coming to get a so-so burger at twice the price?  In addition to that, about 2/3 of the time the chips they serve with the burgers taste stale.  I'm not sure if they make them ahead or not.  They just taste like they did.    Finally...the fortune cookie.  It's never NOT been stale.    My really good experiences are when the burger is well cooked (not cooked well...if you get my meaning), and the chips are crisp and fresh.  I can overlook the stale fortune cookie...I mean it's not why I'm there.  The shakes are great (but too filling for me in general) and I have complaints about the staff.

It's my fault I did not ask if the dressing came on the side, but I've found that restaurants now do this automatically. So when it arrived, I didn't say anything.  The salad was very large and covered with candied walnuts, chopped eggs and bacon, sliced mushrooms and shredded cheese. The combination was perfect. Unfortunately I realized the majority of the salad was drenched in the dressing. I knew I was going to end up taking most of it home, and as we all know, a salad with dressing on it is pretty gross the next day. So I asked for a new one.   What I got back was about 2/3rds the size of the original. Had I eaten that much, I'd understand. But it was obvious I'd only taken a few bites. Also, it was littered with mushrooms and had very little of the other ingredients. My husband ended up taking several helpings of the mushrooms to put on his burger.   The dressing was warm but it was in a very small container and the bacon is actually part of the dressing. So there wasn't enough to even eat a third of the salad (and remember, the portion was small).   BTW, the shakes are awesome. Everyone who got one raved about them.",

So the next day he took us to the real Burgatory restaurant, and it was awesome. I love that you can custom build your own burger with so many different kinds of meat, chicken, crab, etc. There's at least 12 toppings to choose from, ten sauces, and a variety of sides. Also, they have boozy milkshakes, which not many places have and they are good.  If you're in the area and in the mood for great shakes, burgers, fries and service, head over to Burgatory.",

His was great.  Mine had a fantastic flavor, but the pretzels eventually got soggy and all clumped together on the bottom of the glass.  I just didnt eat that part and iy was fine.  We then ordered the Holy 'Mole which is a great guacamole and chips.  The guac had a slight spice which was very tasty.  Husband ordered the Buffalo Bison burger and really liked it.  Great flavor and HUGE portions!  I had the Morty's Steakhouse burger and it tasted like steak.  Really, really, really good.  We both ordered the sea salt and herb fries instead of chips and they were fantastic as well.  Truly, after the chips and shakes, we took a few bites of burgers and fries then had to take the rest home for later!  I think for quality burgers like tgis, it's worth the price.  We will definitely go back next time we are in town.",

The bison burger is incredible and I highly recommend you give it a go one night. Burgatory offers several selections of buns to compliment your burger, but like Chef Ramsey would say, the meat should be the hero of the dish, so I order the brioche every time.   The onion rings are wonderfully battered and huge. You need two people to scarf them down. The homemade chips that come with the meal are beyond addictive.   And just when you think it can get any better... Try one of their awesome milkshakes.   Be hungry tho, cause if you can down the onion rings, burger, chips, AND a milkshake, you belong on Man vs Food!",

We used the no wait app they use and had no problems we left with enough time to not be skipped over and when we arrived it said there was one party ahead of us. We checked in with the host and hostess and the host told me that we got there 53 minutes into a 45-60 minute wait so we expected to wait 7 minutes. 15 minutes and 4 parties (3 of which were 2 people parties like mine) later THE INCOMPETENT HOST LOOKS AT ME AND ASKS ME IF WE'D BEEN HELPED!!! We didn't leave, we didn't walk away, we were literally three feet from the host stand the entire 15 minutes. Trying to remain calm I said to them yes we came in 15 minutes ago to check in you told me that we were 53 minutes into a 45-60 minute wait and we had 1 party ahead of us yet you managed to seat 4. The hostess standing next to him rolled her eyes and asked us to follow her. The only thing keeping me from losing my cool was definitely the thought of the food. Our waitress was super nice though and everything else was great, but the host staff needs training or replaced. Their job is to keep people in their restaurant and with a five guys within walking distance they need to step their game up.",

Mine was pepper crusted aged waygu on whole wheat with farmhouse cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, house sauce, romaine, tomato, pickle, and avacado.  It was cooked rare (yes, rare), and was MELT IN MY MOUTH GOOD.  My husband had a concoction involving mushrooms, greuyre cheese, and some other stuff.  It was also to die for.  The kids got the hormone free beef with cheese and bacon, and my daughter got guacamole on hers as well.  They both BEGGED us to go back again next time we're in the Burgh.

It was so greasy it must have upset her stomach. The second time I went and I got the portabella mushroom sandwich and it too was ok. Nothing great although they did give me a side salad with it instead of those kettle chips that come with the sandwiches. I can't comment on the milkshakes because I would never pay 8$ for a milkshake. Sorry... The overall atmosphere was modern and the service wasn't spectacular but it is what I expected from a burger joint. I think it is overpriced but its the trendy place to go right now.",

    "text": "Sunday evening (~545 PM), pretty busy, trying this for the first time kind-of-a-night in a 'new to me' town, I tried this 'must-do' joint with some guarded enthusiasm.  I am, after all, enthusiastic but skeptical.    That said, the bar was my landing zone.  After a great intro by the bartenders, I ordered a Jamison neat and a Farmer Brown, medium, w/fries.    The order took about 15-20 mins to arrive and was missing the ham and egg (fried).  When alerted to the fact, the bartender promptly complained to the kitchen.  The same burger was returned w/a HARD fried egg and ham (rather than the runny yolk promised).    While quite tasty, the burger was a hot mess.  After having left the kitchen so much later than he ingredients were put together really killed the experience.  The bartenders who sold me the Farmer Brown so diligently were obviously nearly as disappointed as I, but neither one offered anything in terms of a chat to discuss the kitchen's misfire.  The bartenders were helpful and attentive, up until the adversity of two shoddy outputs were delivered.  I'll give it a second try, but will take a little while to return.",

Who has ever heard of a burger with peanut butter? But it was awesome! They got everything right. From the perfectly cooked patties, to the candied bacon to the perfect buns. Everything was great. My son inhaled his burger, so I'm assuming it was good.   I had asked them to pack the burgers desperately because is didn't want to gluten burger to mix with the gluten free. They did put them in seperate boxes. However the guy who took the order made them repack everything in new boxes again because they had put both boxes in the same bag. He didn't want us mixing them up later. Wow!  The only downside is that this place was packed at 5:30 in the evening. We really wanted to eat in but did takeout because it was packed. This place needs to open more stores.",

When it opened, I couldn't understand why people flocked there until I tried it for myself months ago. I'm hooked.   My burger of choice is the Morty's Steakhouse. Medium rare, peppercorn patty with haystack onion straws, BBQ sauce, grilled onions, and cheese. So good it's scandalous. I get it with the house chips and gorge on goodness like the glutton I am. They do a really good job of cooking to order on the burger and they taste juicy every time.   I've only eaten in once so I can't speak to the service. It wasn't bad from what I remember. The people who have taken my order for to-go service have all been polite and fast. It usually takes around 20 minutes to get my food. It's always packed at this particular location with a long wait so I don't bother eating in. I don't seem to be much for eating in anyway.   I love this place and wish desperately it was in more places. I flew in from California and this was the first place I wanted to go after I landed. 3 months pining for a good burger has to mean something.  Ps: the milkshakes are to die for!",

My dad got the Standard Deluxe burger and had not a single compliant; he said it was juicy and tasty! My burger was custom; fitty-fitty (half ground beef, half ground bacon), Buffalo cheddar cheese (good Buffalo flavor), decent sauteed mushrooms and onions (onions were falling off easy. I would do without next time), the truffled shallot aioli was great!  The only reason I give four instead of five was because of the chips and fries. The chips had no flavor...just potato. The fries are \"hand-cut\" and seasoned with sea salt and herbs. The seasoning was okkk but nothing great and I really despise hand-cut fries because they are not crunchy.  Overall definitely worth the experience!!",

    "text": "I've always sat at the bar at this location because unlike the original, there really isn't anywhere fun to pass the wait. It depends on when you go but I always end up here during busy times with a45-60 minute wait which isn't as bad as the original but this location has more seats too.  So long story short, I just go to the bar. It's first come first serve, they have a pretty decent craft beer selection and I like to banter with the bartenders.  There are TVs at the bar and it is centrally located.  I've had several specialty burgers like alligator and duck but typically build my own with either Wagyu or Bison.  I love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar. Those typically find their way onto my burger but I'm always switching it up. My advice is don't overload it because then you miss out on flavors. 4-5 toppings aside from your cheese and rub is probably good.  The fries can be hit or miss sometimes but I typically get a side of Sriracha Romulade to dip them in. The Chips that come free with the burger are excellent!  The Jalapeno Cornbread is a must try! Just make sure they warm the butter for you.  I normally get a shake to go (I can't eat a burger, fries, cornbread and shake in one sitting...I tried once and was miserable after)and really like the Fluffer Nutter Butter. You can always ask what their special is. I've had a few hard shakes and like Gran-Dad's Secret.  I was disappointed my last visit to find that they got rid of banana ketchup and Bangkok Steak Fries. They were both 2 of my favorites but didn't see them on the menu anymore. A waitress at another location suggest I try the honey habanero sauce instead and it was good.  I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and talkative. They always seem to be up for a good time and interact with patrons.  The food has always been consistent. I prefer the original only because of sentimental value.  This place isn't cheap if you go all out.  You might have to wait a decent amount of time for a seat. If either of these two things turns you off then save yourself the frustration.  If you want a truly unique experience with gourmet burgers then do yourself a solid and get to a Burgatory right now! It is my #1 place to get a burger these days!",

    "text": "I was meeting my sister for lunch when I was up in the Pittsburgh area.  We had to decide where to go near Robinson so of course we followed fellow Yelpers and said we HAVE to try out Burgatory.  Surely this is a meal that would not disappoint.  Sigh.  Oh my did it ever.  Preface:  There were three of us eating and we checked it at around 2 p.m. after the major lunch crowd and before dinner.  When we entered we were greeted by the world's most depressing hostess.  We laughed about this afterwards because each time she came to seat another group near us her angst was almost palpable...the subtle scent of bitterness wafted through the air with her every approach.  Then, my sister and I went to use the ladies room before we went to our table.  The bathrooms are so dark you almost need to use your cell phone as a night light.  They were only semi-clean and one of the two soap holders was completely empty and the other barely hanging on.  We made our way to their patio section which is open to the main bar.  It is a nice area and if the weather permits, I suggest sitting there because not only is it covered to avoid rain, but you get an excellent view of the bar/tv's, etc without being totally indoors.  We were then greeted again by one of the worst waitresses I have ever had.  I could go on and on, but she consistently rushed us and made us feel as if we were imposing on her schedule (again, not during a rush time of dining).  For example, one time when she came back to our table to see if we were ready to order, I told her that my sister was outside taking a business call (politely left the dining area not to disturb other customers) and she acted as if this was an imposition.  Food and drink.  There are only two wines that Burgatory offers.  Neither of these are listed on the drink menu; rather, they are listed within the main menu.  You are supposed to intuitively know this, otherwise your waitress will make you feel like a dummy.  At $8 per glass they do give you a generous pour (probably 6 ounces) but they brag about how many beers they have on tap and their mixed cocktails and yet only provide a \"red\" and \"white\" wine selection.  Also, I don't want to spend $4.50 for a Yeungling draft beer when I am in PA.  Down in the south where it is a domestic \"import\", yes I would.  For appetizers we ordered the onion rings and the nachos (with chicken chili on the side because I am a veg/pesc.)  The onion rings are $8 for five onion rings.  They were large and amply breaded but I thought they were not as crispy or worth the price tag in my opinion.  At $1.30/piece I expect perfection.  The nachos were a mess.  They are huge and full of wonderful toppings but by the time you receive them, all but the outer chips are soggy and a mess.  We left most of the plate uneaten.    For dinner the hubby ordered the Meat Your Maker burger ($14).  I tried one of his fries after he said they were terrible and I agreed.  They were soft, no crispiness at all.  He ordered it with the beef option and said that it was OK.  My sister and I split the Crab Shack burger (portions, beside the onion rings, are huge).  This was the saving grace of the experience.  If you go there, this is the burger to get.  Ample crab meat, few fillers and pan fried perfectly. However, the \"chips\" they serve along side were overly cooked, almost burnt.  Not at all a good accompaniment.    In total our bill was $109 for 3 people for three draft beers, two glasses of wine, 2 apps and 2 sandwiches including an 18% tip (after tax so really 20%, as opposed to my usual 25%...because of terrible service).  That price tag is right for an excellent lunch but certainly not appropriate for our experience.  In short, highly overrated and highly overpriced.  Even if my expectations were elevated by its reputation, this restaurant falls dramatically short of a 5 star rating.  P.s.  When we went back to the restroom after dinner the soap dispensers were still empty and we did not receive a thank you from the depressed hostess.  As Yelp says, \"Me thinks not.\"",

We came in at a pretty busy time but were seated immediately at a table we really enjoyed. Our waitress was incredible. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and food, was just the right degree of attentive, and quickly served us. We created our own burgers which I highly recommend! The burgers were delicious. I had a bison burger and my date had grass-fed beef. The ingredients were amazing and presentation was lovely. The atmosphere is fun and was busy when we were there, but nobody was too loud, everyone was having a wonderful time. Considering all that we ordered, it was very reasonably priced and we can't wait to come back soon!",

Even during the day there is a romantic darkness to it. The waitress was nice and patient, explaining the entire menu to us as we were newbies.  I ordered the Rosemarys Smash and a steakhouse burger. My hubby got  a nice tall draft beer with the PBJ burger. For an appetizer we ordered the frites with the truffled gorgonzola cheese.  The drink was DELICIOUS!! Nice and and refreshing. So good I ordered two of them. the appetizer was out of sight! I could have just ate that and been satisified. My burger was simply amazing! It reminds me of the steakhouse burger Red Robin has. My hubbys burger he remarked was also delicious. The sweet potato fries that came with the meal were so/so. I could have done without.    For the topoff we ordered the Grandad's Secret! Yummy alcohol infused shake that we shared and slurped down.  Great restaurant to try when visiting Pittsburgh!",

Plus, high points for having the waitlist feature. There's notoriously a long wait here during the weekends, so this is brilliant to just add your name from your house our en route and cut your wait time in half.   I'm also a fan of the fact that they carry gluten free buns. So I can have a legit burger. My go to recently has been a make your own with garlic aioli, smoked gouda cheese and pickled jalapenos. Copy me if you want, it's a killer combo! Shakes are amazing and chips are crispy. This all makes for a very tasty and satisfying trip!",

The sandwich itself was good, at first bite the pretzel bun was weird but it grew on me quickly and I loved it. The mayo they used was bomb af. the only thing is the prices of everything is a tad higher than I would think since they all serve chips instead of fries with the sandwiches default, I assumed a burger joint would automatically include French fries but I guess I'm wrong. The burgers are average size that's why I assumed they would come with fries for what the price was but no. my sandwich was 12 dollars not too high but I wish they paired with fries. I would get that sandwich again, but it's not a place I would choose to go to",

They shared the only option is no pink or lots of pink. Hmmm never heard that from a burger place before.   I said no pink then and I was happy when my burger came out and it wasn't dry. So for that I am very thankful. I asked for fries. Normally comes with chips. It cost be 1.50 more and the fries were definitely a small amount.   Good thing the burger tasted amazing otherwise I would have said skip this place. But because the burger tasted one of the best I have ever had. I will give it five stars.  Wouldn't mind the owners putting just a little more fries in there if you are going to pay more for them and teach your cooks that a little pink is called medium well.",

Both meals were delicious as well.     The complaints?   One, the food took a really long time to come out.  They were busy, but it was an exceptionally long time.    And two...we went because it was a chain.  I hate chains in general, but we had dietary restrictions and chains have nutritional info online, so we were going for ease.  Turns out that they are a small chain, so they are exempt from the requirements.   This made it more difficult to order for sure.  I also wonder about when they grow big enough to have to do this, because I don't even want to know how many calories were in the butter soaked short rib sandwich that I ate.     All in all, it's a good meal and they do have some healthier options if you seek them out.   Not my favorite though for the money.",

    "text": "Cool restaurant. Great burgers. I ordered the chicken burger. For some reason I thought it was going to be a chicken breast but when i got it i realized it was ground chicken. I wasn't disappointed, I just wasn't expecting that. I'm not sure if the menu mentioned that it was ground meat but just a heads up... Anyway, it was great! Great flavor on my chicken burger topped with garlic, mushrooms, and fried leeks. The french fries were crispy and hot. They also have a large selection of draft craft beers. Definitely a great place to try - especially if you like specialty burgers!",

    "text": "Awesome! My husband and I took a weekend trip to Pittsburgh and stopped at Burgatory on the way out of town. It was by far both of our favorite meal of the trip. The atmosphere/decor had us rooting for the food to be good before we even saw a menu and everything went up from there. I built my own chicken sandwich (chicken breast instead of burger) with fries and my husband chose the potluck burger with chips. Both sandwiches were uniquely and incredibly delicious. So good it will have me wanting to drive the three hours to cinch the craving for a while. The chips were a very thick kettle cooked chip and they weren't bad, but weren't special. The fries were fresh and had almost a sweet seasoning on them which I found okay and my husband liked. Not that we had any room left for more, but we did get a choco taco shake to go (minus the alcohol)! Yummy. It was definitely pricey, but I feel like you could see and taste the quality of the up charge. Service was great as well! This is an \"upscale\" burger bar done right.",

    "text": "People seem to love this place. We went on a Tuesday night and had a minimal wait time to be seated. Parking is a little bit tough on weekends so beware! The waitstaff was nice enough. They answered our questions politely but had the tendency to disappear for long periods of time. Still, they did their job just fine and I don't really like when waiters hover.   The food seemed pretty straightforward. Burgers taking up most of the menu. They give you the option to build your own so I took that route. I got a beef burger, wheat bun, chedder cheese, salt and pepper rub, garlic mayo, lettuce, onion, poblano peppers and greens. Their system for asking how you want the burger done is red, pink or done (I can't actually remember the word they used for well done, sorry). I chose pink.   My burger arrived and I got American cheese instead of cheddar. Kind of disappointing right off the bat but not a deal breaker by any means. The garlic mayo was fabulous. The toppings were all fresh and crisp. The wheat bun was delicious and not too thick. The actual burger patty was a huge disappointment. My burger was charred on the outside, pink in the middle, and super dry. Maybe we were just there on an off night but if they did a better job of cooking the burger it would have been a heavenly hamburger. Everything about it was great except the actual beef. Another member of our party got her burger done to \"red\" and she said hers was the same way. Charred on the outside and a bit dry though red in the middle. It was kind of disappointing. I've had better burgers but really think if the actual patty had been cooked differently it really would have been a great burger I got my burger with the standard russet and sweet potato chips. There were about three sweet potato chips to the rest russet. Kind of sad since the sweet potato ones were far superior. I'm going to give this place another chance and hope for a better outcome.",

You are so close to your neighbors that you really should not talk about anything personal as the neighbors will be able to know all about your issues.

Being Gluten Free and having to eat a burger with no bun is not the same.  It is a real treat to eat a hamburger with all the fixin's.  I always order the make your own burger and the staff is up to date on Gluten Free do's and don'ts.  Even this last time, we sat at the bar and the bartender was nice to tell me that the french fries are cross contaminated.  Its very rare to have such a knowledge staff especially since it is not a full on GF place.  It is a little pricey, but I'm use to paying more for GF food anyways.  The only complaint I have was the burger was a little too burnt on the outside, but the burger was still cooked perfectly on the inside.   Sit at the bar for quick service.  The bartenders always had our glasses full and we were in and out very quickly.  Can't wait to come again.",

We knew that  with our party of 11, on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend that we should expect a wait.  We heard the buzz, liked the concept and were looking forward to having a little family reunion to eat, drink, have some burgers and spend some money!  We were patient, flexible and told the hostess we could split up the party.  We were initially told that the wait would be 60 minutes and that they would text us when our table was ready, so we thought that was great and went out and shopped for nearly an hour.   When we checked back at the 60 minute mark, we were told they had initially quoted 60-75 minutes, then the 3rd time we checked in, we were told that they said 75-90 minutes... What?!?!  During this wait we saw (4) booths in a row open up and a 4 top with (2) 2 tops next to it that could have been pushed together.  Finally, I asked to speak to the manager who was unhelpful and insincere.  Apparently only one table was designated for large parties.  Rather than compromise or use common sense, they chose to lose customers and business.  We walked around the corner to Five Guys and received excellent food and friendly service.",

    "text": "I had heard locals discussing Burgatory while in town on business. So, after bumping across the location tucked away in the most confusing shopping complex ever conceived (Robinson Center area) I stopped in for a Sunday afternoon solo lunch.  Like others seated ahead of me, I was warmly greeted and shown to a table (unfortunately it was one of those banquette-style jobs where you're virtually forced to learn everything you didn't want to know about the in-laws of the patron sitting next to you). If you choose not to sit at the bar chances are good you'll be dealt the same hand...but I understand maximizing seating during peak operating hours. Nevertheless, the place was clean in spite of the crowd.  The server (Alec) did a good job of breaking down the menu, pointing out house specialties, options and the Custom Creation \"worksheet.\" If you're an at home burger-meister, plan on spending 10 minutes or more determining which \"standard\" or Custom Creation is for you. I went with a customized, but relatively straightforward Kona crusted, hormone-free burger with sauteed mushrooms, pickle and horseradish cream sauce. As I'm trying to watch my ever-growing profile I passed on a bun but was considering both the herbed focaccia and brioche versions.  My order arrived on a timely basis and was attractively served. If you're looking for dripping grease (as we all have at one time or another) you'll be happier at the 5 Guys located a couple doors down. The meat was fresh and the sea salt and herb fries were hot and ideally crispy. My server stopped back to check on me on a timely basis and handled his section of tables easily. By the way, all staff was very friendly and appeared to be well trained. In spite of the business levels there was no sign of the panic we've all seen elsewhere.  Regrettably, I passed on a milk shake \"to go\" (remember the growing profile?) but will definitely give it a shot when I'm less disciplined. Anyway, I was surprised to leave the restaurant with a tab of around $15...which is a True value for a well served, tasty burger of my own concoction. Give Burgatory a try. And, if you see me order a milk shake to go, give me a break, ok?",

She asked if we had been there before (we hadn't) and then haphazardly explained the menu (\"You can order one of the pre-designed burgers or make your own by filling out this form.\") and the concept.  They have all these different rubs and sauces and such.  Some of them are self-explanatory but then there are others that you have no clue what is in them (such as the angel dust).  Having never been there and the fact that my wife is pregnant and can't have gluten or lots of sugar/carbs (and I explained this to the waitress), we had a lot of questions.  Our waitress wasn't very happy about that. As for the food, I ordered the topless bison burger with horseradish cheddar, the truffle aioli, the bayou cajun rub, pickles, onions, mixed greens and banana peppers with the quinoa salad.  The wife ordered the hormone free beef burger with white american, mayo, lettuce, pickles and angel dust and the organic mixed greens (salad).  The bison burger was good, between the cheese and rub it had a nice kick to it.  There was so much mixed greens that it was impossible to see the burger.  The quinoa salad was kind of bland, if not for the bell peppers and goat cheese.  The beef burger was good, but kind of your standard burger.  The wife really would have liked to have pepper jack cheese instead of the white american, but the pepper jack isn't offered. All-in-all, we felt it was an underwhelming experience, considering the price and the hoopla associated with the place.  We probably won't go back again.  Oh, and make sure that you pay with something other than the Discover Card, they don't accept it.",

I had a strawberry shake and they are so rich, and in spite of the fact I don't tolerate sugar and fats well anymore I downed it. It tasted great both directions. My reason for three stars isn't the food. The wait is long and the price to value ratio is pretty high. It is after all a hamburger.  If you are prepared to drop 20-25 per person for a burger, go for it.",

    "text": "My wife and I went in around 9:45 pm on Friday night, only to find that it was going to be at least an hour before we got a table. We were a bit too tired to wait that long, so we came back the next night around 6. After about a 70 minute wait at the bar (at which we luckily got seats right away), we were sat. Our server, Seena, was very helpful as it was our first time there. The menu was full of some great sounding burgers, but we both decided to build our own using their cool little checklist system. I went with the wagyu beef, crusted in peppercorns, with spicy ketchup, red onion, and dill served on the standard brioche. I wanted to keep it pretty simple for my first time. I also upgraded to the fries. Glad I did, they were fresh cut, and fried perfectly. The burger was great, although I think I accidentally ordered it well done. Definitely order it medium or rare. Even so, it was still pretty juicy. The bun was soft but stable. It didn't break or mush up under the pressure. I washed it all down with a chocolate shake. Possibly one of the best shakes I've had, although there was a bit too much whipped cream.  Over all, it was a pretty great burger and dining experience. The service at the bar was so-so, but that's Pittsburgh for you.",

And yes, I have had some great burgers. My top burger spot used to be held by a pub in Vegas but this took that away. We both did the choose your own. It was fun filling out the card. There are so many neat choices, I can't wait to go back and try more. I'd love to try the crab burger, but I can't not bring myself to not get a regular burger. We both had ours cooked \"red\" and it was so juicy and the toppings were perfect. We also had a strawberry pretzel milkshake and it was out of this world. I still think about both the burger and the shake...Service was great, we didn't have to wait long and I love the text system that they text you when your table is ready so you can go shop nearby.

Burgers were not contest worthy...nearing bad. Over priced under-sized and under-cooked...I like a pink burger but this was half alive when we ate them.   Milkshake was topping overload! All it was was chopped up pretzels with a little bit of ice cream. Not pleased.  Onion rings were best part of the lunch...they were good but we were also really hungry at that point as they were apps.  For 2 burgers, 2 kids grilled cheese, 2 drinks, onion rings and one shake....we spent $80.

The straight up original burger tasted good but when the burger is so small that there is  over an inch of bun all the way around, it simply is not worth the $11.00 they charge. You would think the waitress would see that I had trimmed the bun all the way around, and would question why I did this. I'm not sure if they had a newbie in the kitchen or what, but I definitely will not return. Don't even get me going on the chips...simply awful-stale and almost burned.

The meat was good but you better like horseradish!  The sauce was slapped on quickly and so thick in some places that this was all you tasted.  The fries were uninspiring. My biggest issue is the wait.  We got there early and were seated in 20 minutes (the wait is usually over an hour).  We then waited over 30 minutes after ordering to get our food.  The food simply isn't good enough to justify an hour from when we stepped in the door to having food at our table (for those of you doing the math, I'm including the time that we waited to order).  They are so busy that the waitress doesn't have time to see how  you're doing.  And don't expect to have a quiet conversation, it is very loud there. Go across the street, the wait time is slightly less and the food is better.",

    "text": "My family and I were in Coraopolis when my father had business training. After the rest of us spent a day at the Pittsburgh zoo (and in awful city traffic) we picked him up and were at our hotel wondering what to do for dinner. We'd seen the billboard for burgatory along the highway and laughed at the clever name ( we've been known to visit restaurants because of their name many times) so I looked it up on yelp. I'm not sure why this location has fewer stars than the one in Pittsburgh, but don't head into downtown traffic if you're going to burgatory. Anyway, we wanted ice cream and had noticed that burgatory was famous for its shakes, so, being in a meaty mood, we opted to go there and get dessert there as well. Best decision of that whole trip, foodwise. It was less than ten minutes from our hotel, and easy to find in a small strip. The inside is decorated with a giant decision making quiz thing on the wall and red outlines of haloed and demon tailed cows (that sounds creepy, but it's not, I promise.) The hostess seated us right away, and a waitress arrived right behind her to take drink orders and explain the menu. As other reviewers have explained, each table has notepads on which you can mark your choices of patty, bun, sauce, dusting, cheese, and dozens of toppings to build your own burger. And not just as in one patty or two, american or swiss, but as in choose from beef, elk, crab, chicken, beef and bacon ground together, veggie burger. . . yeah. The menu lists several favorite in house burgers, one of which I got. It was the bacon and jelly and PB one, I forget the name. My parents shared the classic burger, and my brother got the kids burger, which is actually two tiny sliders. Everything comes with chips, but you can get their jalapeno cornbread, fries, side salad, or potato salad instead. They also have sandwiches and salads, but if you go here, it's a bit of a sacrilege to get anything  but a burger. Anyway, all of ours were phenomenal. I got the cornbread as my side, and it was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. And speaking of sweet. . . the milkshakes. I'm a bit of a milkshake addict. These hit the spot. They have several alcoholic flavors and several plain, all of them special creations you'll be hard pressed to discover elsewhere. Be warned: I ate my entire milkshake and three bites each of burger and cornbread. That's how huge the shakes are. Think old diner or soda fountain style, with the server bringing out the metal mixing cup with your whipped cream topped glass. I ordered the butter butter fluffernutter shake, my mom the salted caramel pretzel, my brother the chocolate chip cookie, and my dad just plain chocolate. They were all fantastic! The waitress was polite and attentive the entire time. The only itch was that the shakes were a bit slow coming out, and they mixed up my moms order. Other than that, this place was marvelous! Definitely go and get a shake - just be prepared to share!",

    "text": "Eh... I have mixed feelings on this place. I'm not exactly a fan of a big ol' burger. I like thinner patties, think Steak and Shake style (but not exactly Steak and Shake, if that makes sense). The boyfriend really wanted to go here, so I caved. The appeal for me was not having to order beef. I'm not a beef hater, like I said, I just don't care for a huge, thick burger patty. Give me a steak and I'm good to go.   I was set on ordering the crab, but when we pulled up outside the smell of the grill got me. I decided to go with Elk instead. I have had elk before, many times, but never ground. I've had it smoked, steaks, that sort, but not as a burger. I went with the build your own. I should have probably ordered the crab, but I have a feeling if I did, I would have been equally disappointed.   Let me jump around for a minute...here's what was good about my experience: 1. The appetizer and sauces. I ordered the onion rings. They were deliciously crispy, and I enjoyed the horseradish dip and the spicy ketchup.  2. The shake! I pay dearly (with nausea and a wicked stomach ache) if I eat too much ice cream/milk. I regret nothing. I ordered the carmel pretzel and it was really good. I couldn't finish it, but only because I know better.  And...that's about it. The burger...eh...it just didn't do it for me. I liked most of the components. The blue cheese was delicious, and is probably what helped me through the half I did choke down. The field greens were fresh and crisp. The brioche was pretty good, but had an odd aftertaste. I didn't care for the onion rub, and I love onion. It tasted very...I don't know...dollar store spice rack? I could say the same about the onion relish. I love onion relish. This one was weird, and very gooey. Bummer. The elk itself was the biggest disappointment. My $12 patty was way too thick, and small. There was about 3/4\" of bun all the way around the patty. I found this annoying. Rather than a big, dry, flavorless wad of meat, they could have pressed it out flatter, cooked it less time, and covered more of the bun. I think it would have tasted better. It wasn't juicy at all. And remember, I said I've had elk before. It wasn't that I just tried something new and didn't like it. It was really, really gamey, and very chewy. I just couldn't do it. Total disappointment.   I totally agree with the other comment made about the waitresses being \"frosty.\" Ours explained nothing. Didn't ask if we had questions, didn't explain the rubs, nothing. Whatever.   The boyfriend got one of the bison burgers, and he liked it, and enjoyed his alcoholic shake. If we do go back, I'll probably try the crab, or maybe just stick to appetizers.   For what you get, I think this place is really overpriced, and the main attraction, the burgers, severely overrated. As for atmosphere, the chairs are hard, metal, and uncomfortable, and the tables are really tiny. A water, a milkshake, and the tin, for 3 people (a friend had joined us) plus appetizer plates and burgers, and all the standard crap in the center of the table already, and we were knocking things over all over each other. It was loud, crowded, and just not that awesome. Unless the boy demands it, I probably won't come back.",

Landed here on a Friday night at the end of happy hour so waitress hustled us to order drinks and apps before the cut-off time.  The guacamole was exceptional but the onion rings were so, so.  I am particular about onion rings and while the dip was tasty the rings were tasteless and chewy, which happens when the green layer of the onion isn't taken away.  I like to taste the onion.  I made my own burger:  bison -pink-naked. It was barely pink on the inside and had burnt crispy edges not to my liking. Bison tends to be dry so ordered horseradish cream but it was to thin and looked like they poured a tablespoon of milk over my burger. There was no horseradish flavor either. My burger was served with chips - so browned they tasted burnt so couldn't eat them.   I did not complain because it took SO long to get our meal we thought the waitress had forgotten us and I didn't want our party to have to wait for my food.  I used the dip from the onion rings to disguise the dryness and crispy edged taste of my burger. We didn't stay to order dessert.   The Hubs had the wagu burger and said it was just ok, nothing special, and not cooked the way he requested.   I must say we had 1 person at our table who has severe allergies and the staff was accommodating and able to answer questions made to satisfaction.",

    "text": "While the rest of the Northeast and eastern US is being infested with Burger Fi's (a chain that hasn't hit Pitt yet, but likely will soon) it seems Burgatory has taken over this region, which is a good thing. Meanwhile, keep in mind, this concept isn't new. Chains like The Counter and Unami Burger (and Burger Fi, among others) started this kinda experience more than a decade ago.   It's nice to be able to now find a quality burger (in Western PA) that rivals the pricing at Five Guys (ok, maybe it's higher here), but blows away the quality and value. If you haven't been to this growing small chain yet - it's time for a visit. Burgatory is a must for those who like, yep, you guessed it: burgers.   Visitors can design their own burger or choose from a specialty burger. Rather than just traditional hamburgers you can order an elk, buffalo, turkey, chicken, veggie and others, which helps allieve the monotony of always eating a regular hamburger. Personally, I prefer the custom meal where you can choose your meat, cheese, toppings and seasonings. They do a great job with all.   One thing to keep in mind, however, is you are going to pay for quality. This isn't a cheap place to grab a quick meal. Instead, the burger alone will likely cost you $15, a small price to pay for the quality received. Add a side salad and a drink and you can expect $20 a person. (The side salad is top-notch greens, not crappy iceberg). Keep in mind, you get what you pay for. And, you won't be disappointed here.",

    "text": "After being recommended this place by my friend and hearing so many good things I decided to finally visit Burgatory.  I had read that there was an app called No Wait that helps you get into their computerized queue without actually being there so it would help you with not having to wait at the actual restaurant in person.  They set it up as a text when your table is ready.  Unfortunately I didn't get the app to work with my phone probably because my phone number is from Canada.  Perhaps their system doesn't allow texts that are outside the US?  This is a gourmet burger place that offers choices.  There is a even a choice of shakes both alcoholic and non alcoholic.  While the menu has ready made choices of burgers they do give the option to build your own creation.  That to me is absolutely intriguing!  When creating your own burger there is a pad of paper where the condiments are on the side along with pencils to fill in your choices.  Your choices are for choice of burger (meats) from beef, chicken, bison, crab, wagyu beef, elk or veggie.  You pick a bun type, dry rubs, cheese, sauces, and a very wide variety of toppings.  Depending on the extras you would like there are extra charges but the variety of choices leave you with so many possibilities.  Building your own burger is cool but having the quantity of choices they have to choose from makes it truly a customized experience.  We had started with starter of Gorgonzola fries and they were really good.   I ended up going with the bison on a brioche with bbq rub, Amish Gorgonzola, roasted garlic mayo, applewood smoked bacon, banana peppers, and arugula.  My wife had ordered the aged wagyu on a baguette with kona crust rub (coffee and chocolate), horseradish cheddar, roast garlic mayo, and guacamole.  If I could change something I would change the fact that the burgers come with chips.  It is a mix of yellow and sweet potato chips.  If the chips were say fried fresh that would be different.  They seem like they are just from a bag and ready made.  It would be a better experience if they came with fries that you could upgrade like what we ordered prior instead if you wanted to or just plain fries on the side.  I wasn't really a fan of the chips but the burgers and fries were really good.  I liked the ambiance, the drinks and the fun involved in making the choice to build our own burgers.  The burgers were very good and although it's costs more than say a Five Guys this is an experience not just a place to get full.  The ingredients and variety of choices to choose from are NOT something you will see at just about any other chain burger place whether upscale/gourmet or not.  This place really does give you something different and judging on how busy the place is... they seem to be doing something right.  I would definitely return to Burgatory.  This is a Pittsburgh success as far as I am concerned.  Well done!",

Except that they wanted to stick our party of 6 on a table for 4 that was right in the middle of a bunch of other tables. His solution was that we could fit three on the bench side (there were two seats), and they would add another chair to the other side that had two chairs. Basically, no way in heck could we fit 6 people. When I objected he told me that I could have the first available table for 6. When I asked how long that would be - the response was 'I have no idea'.  So, the wait started over again.",

    "text": "WOAH!!! This is man food.  Feminist stop reading.  This review will be a sexist, meat infested, beer soaked debauchery.  The things my body had to go through after my meal here are too perverse to write for fear of women and children reading this review but oooooh so worth it.  We got here around 6:30 on a Sunday night and were told we had a 30 minute wait so to the bar we went.  My slightly large buddy looked at the menu and said \"Gents, I think we need to slow play this meal\". I didn't understand at the time but I always take a fat man's advice when dining.  When we got to the table we ordered the beer battered onion rings and \"Just Fork It\" to split amongst us 3 to start.  The onion rings are 5 large onion rings that come with a spicy ketchup and a sauce very much like the sauce from the Blooming Onion at Outback.  These were really good despite usually only liking the very thin onion rings.  The 'Just Fork It' is a bunch of french fries topped with pot roast, gravy and cheese curds.  It's like a Gluttapoolza of flavors that only a man could appreciate.  Women should wear a perfume of this stuff.    After we ate this we sipped our beers and waited for 30-40 before ordering our burgers.  I ordered a Morty's Steakhouse burger.   It's a peppercorn crusted beef patty with horseradish cheddar cheese, onion strings(enough for a seperate side dish), and a Cabernet sauce.  SOOOOOOOO good and huge!  This comes with heated chips but for 1.50 more you can get a different side dish.  I got the pork belly smoked baked beans.  The name was better than the actual flavor but it's just a side dish.  Why worry about Sideshow Bob when you have Krusty the Klown in front of you!?!?.....wait what?  Nevermind, moving right a long. The burger is the star of the meal and the Morty's Burger is as good as any I can remember.  At this point I was damn near in a food coma while the Apps, and burger were having an MMA fight inside the caged octagon that is my belly. BUT, alas we were not done.  We had to have one of their milkshakes.  I got the Nutella Crunch shake.  I remember it having what seemed like an entrie Nestle Crunch bar in there.  Such decadence.  I blacked out after that and remember nothing more.",

Everyone made their own burger at the table and we found the hormone free beef to be too fatty. It was juicy but the grease soaked through our buns (even through the focaccia). The dry aged wagyu was super dry and over cooked.   Even with a rub on the patties I found it to be unflavorful. The burgers came with chips but mine were too soaked in grease to enjoy.   We also ordered their alcoholic bacon milkshake as a dessert. It was very yummy but super sweet. We shared one milkshake between 3 ppl  Overall we got great service and environment but the food was average. Five guys would have been a better choice next door.",

    "text": "I'm just going to come out and say it, I'm not a fan in the least of this place. I've been to several locations, and go way more often than I should but between really \"wanting\" to like it, and friends that do, I keep giving it a shot.   I really love the idea of the place. A build your own gourmet burger with a large selection of proteins, breads, seasonings, veggies and condiments as well as trendy adult shakes. Unfortunately, both typically fall short. Anyways, in no particular order, the airing of the grievances:  No burger is worth a 90 minute wait. This seems a bigger issue at Fox Chapel or the Waterfront for me. The burger is good, but not worth the wait at all.   The best sip of their milkshake is the first. Each one thereafter gets a little less good. Speaking of the milkshakes, what the hell is the \"whipped cream\" on top. It doesn't move or melt. I took a picture....  The buns/bread. You don't think about the bread until it isn't good, and i have never been impressed with the bread here. The last burger i had i took off the ciabatta. It was dry and broke to pieces while I tried to eat. It was such a waste i just left it on the plate.   The service is about a wash. I've never had bad service per se, but haven't really had exceptional either. Case in point on a recent visit, we had to wait a pretty long time to get back the receipt to sign. It was only after about 15 minutes we were told there was an issue with the credit card processing system. No back up plan, no way to expedite, just a genuine apology and still having to wait. I'm not sure what they could really do here, but at my last visit to a fast food chain, it took five minutes to receive my order and the manager comped the whole thing for what he (not me) deemed and unacceptable wait.",

Like I feel like I can't really taste the difference between angel dust, diablo dust and Kingston jerk. No difference though. As long as my burger is tasty and cooked right I won't fuss. The $1.50 upcharge on the fries is not worth it. They were hard and crispy and for all that I could have just stuck with chips for free.   I also had the chocolate milkshake. I know..how gluttonous of me. It was amazing. Everything is clearly fresh and made with quality ingredients. I think next time I will get my milkshake spiked...because they do that.   Service was great once we got to the table but they quoted us at 10-15 minutes to be seated and we didn't get to a table for about 30 minutes. A little annoyed with that only because the hostess should just properly quote the wait and then we would have just gone to eat at the bar.   Overall, delicious...great service and great ambiance. I'll be back again for sure.",

Beer selection was good, but not what everyone is blowing it up to be.    Built my own burger with the Wagu Beef, and the waitress (although cute and kind) was not overly helpfull.  I expected so much more from the beef, but it just didn't deliver.  The burger ended up being underwhelming for the price, and I expected much more.    I had no room for a milkshake although they looked and sounded delicious.    All-in-all.... An OK burger at a higher price.  Drinks were good and economical, but only because I hit it at Happy Hour.

When arriving to Burgatory, you will undoubtedly be welcomed by a line of individuals waiting for a table and complaining about the long wait.  Regardless of lunch or dinner/ weekdays or weekends, there will be a wait.  Once inside, the restaurant is tightly packed and loud.  As you can imagine, the turnover is important to keep the aforementioned line moving, so meals are served quickly and the staff seemingly pressures patrons to finish and relinquish their table.  I am a fan of Burgatory as the take-out options are of the same quality and you do not need to put up with 45 minutes of the above mentioned atmosphere.    The beer selections, however, may keep you tuned at the bar while you wait for your take out order or make the stale atmosphere more palatable.  From rotating taps, to local craft bottles, the selections will usually have a discovery for even the well traveled brew explorer.",

You can build your own burger with lots of imaginative toppings, cheeses, buns and breads, rubs, sauces, and if you're not feeling the hormone free beef, try the free range chicken, bison, lump crab, or go vegan with a grilled portobello or black bean veggie patty.   I had the grilled portobello on a whole wheat bun, grilled problano peppers, fresh spinach, arugula, and micro greens. My rub was Cajun, and I topped it off with a truffle aioli.   I thank the Burger Gods from above that the Robinson store opened because now I don't have to travel the god forsaking route 28 to go to the store near Fox Chapel. Burgatory can stand up to those burger joints you see on TV across the nation, no gimmicks here, none of that 25 pound burger challenge, just honest to goodness ingredients at a great price.",

It's not the closest to me, but it's definitely worth the drive to go to Burgatory.    The setup is well done too!  Sometimes there can be a line, but their wait list system allows you to leave a number and shop while you wait!  And when it's time to order, they have an order sheet that allows you to select and document whatever your heart desires!  There's also a decent happy hour selection, but really, I'm there for the burger!",

The wait can get long...but lately, its been under an hour, even for big groups.  I think the Wagyu burger is the best in Pittsburgh - and I've searched far and wide for the best. The meat has a nice, deep flavor to it, and I get to pick my own toppings (I usually get something similar to the \"Meat your Maker\", keeping it simple).  However, nearly every the time I've been there with more than 4 people, someones burger got messed up. They forget toppings, or switch part of the toppings of two peoples burgers, or another I-can't-understand-how-this-happened error. To their credit, they usually remake it and give us the burger for free...but we end up waiting a while. Once, they even had to remake the burger twice! On top of that, when the group is big, the burgers usually end up overcooked.  So go and enjoy a fantastic burger...but keep the groups small.  Pro-tips: Pay a little extra for the jalapeno corn bread. Comes with a slightly sweetened vanilla butter - so good! Don't order your shake before your burger!! Sweets make bad appetizers, but great desserts.",

My opinion, total BS! Started with $7 onion rings which consisted of ONLY 4 rings! Not bad, kind of bland..but, $7 for 4 onion rings...don't waste your money! The regular chocolate shake wasn't bad..nothing to write home about..but, ok...the veggie burger...one of the most BLAND tasting burgers I've ever had. I know that most meat eaters have no idea on how much seasoning it takes to make seeds and mushrooms  taste flavorful...and Burgatory proves my point. Between my wife and I, we dropped $48 on onion rings, 2 shakes and 2 burgers..Stay away from this one my Veggie friends!",

Between the hard shakes (toasted almond torte) and the bison burger I don't know where to begin. I even had the quinoa Apple salad the other day and it was surprisingly delicious! Ive stopped here for a quick meal and the sliders and some Gorgonzola truffle fries are a tasty snack. The fries alone are amazing. Don't expect to get out of here without stuffing yourself. My only complaint is that the seating is kind of odd. Lots of high tops (which I don't like) and uncomfortable chairs. Sometimes the area can be quite loud with the TVs on and a bunch of people talking in the open air environment. Overall, extremely pleased with this burger joint and will continue to return!",

    "text": "This place has a decent selection of burgers to choose from. i love that fact that the beef is hormone free and none processed and that there's more than just one kinda beef. They also serve Wagyu and crab cake and veggie.   You can customize your burger with endless combinations of toppings, sauces and spices; plus their variety of ingredients are your standard choices. I believe i tried the crab cake burger last time with arugula, tomato, red onion, spicy mayo, aioli and the memphis rub. It was just ok, they crab meat wasn't bursting with flavor but was more like a fish sandwich to me. I prefer there veggie burger which is soft but tends to fall apart to easily. I don't mind it crumbling though because all the extra toppings that tends to slide off the burger can be eaten together with a fork instead of your hands and fingers.   The milkshakes are outta this world!!! Very creamy and fattening of course. My favorite is the strawberry and the caramel pretzel...MMMHHHH!!! It's not your average milkshake and when they say heavenly shakes...they mean it!! The price is not bad for the quality of food you get but i don't think $11 for a veggie burger with basic toppings is too fair. None the less if i am in the mood for a burger this is where i will go, not to mention the milkshake too. It's about an 35 minute drive with no traffic but id still prolly go there if it was an hour away.",

Every time I go back to the city, I need to either get a burger or a shake from there, no matter how late it might make me to something. I am obsessed with its caramel pretzel shake. It is to die for -- I highly recommend it. Food-wise, I am obsessed with the 'meat your maker' burger. You cannot go wrong with it. The food is always done to perfection, and the fries are crispy and golden. You might have to wait a little while, and since they don't take reservations, I highly recommend downloading the \"nowait\" app, so you can jump in line and not have to wait in line at the restaurant if it's a long wait. I can't wait to go back to Pittsburgh and grab another shake, or meal, while I am there, from Burgatory.",

    "text": "To make a play on a Field of Dreams quote \"If you build it, they will come,\" I would like to think of the new Burgatory as \"If you build it bigger, it will still be packed.\"  My mom and I came here at 1:45 on a Monday afternoon when most places would not see every table packed, and this place was hopping and full of people.  The 10min wait gave me a chance to walk around and see the beauty and detail the owners made sure was given to the new restaurant.  I love it.  So, the food.  It is just as delicious as the other location.  The Bangkok steak fries, in my opinion, is the most delicious item on the menu.  I could order one for an appetizer and one for my meal.  I think they should start offering pieces of the fried mushrooms as a burger topping.    My custom burger was cooked perfectly with all of the toppings that I had asked for, and it was mouthwateringly good.  Is it just me, or does it get harder and harder to build a custom burger when I know whatever they serve me I am going to love.  It just makes things so difficult.  My mom's turkey sandwich had me questioning if I should stray away from my normal burger choice the next time I come here.  It was extremely good.  If you don't like burgers, I would definitely recommend Hurky's Turkey.  Finally, the shake.   Ohhhhh Burgatory shake how you do such terrible things to my stomach.  But as the board in the restaurant says: The shakes are healthy if you don't think about it, soooooo don't think about it, and enjoy their amazing shakes.  They are worth all the calories in the world.    Every time that I have come to Burgatory, I have never had a bad experience.  All of my friends who I have brought and family members who I have brought to Burgatory when they are in town all agree that this place is something special.  Even when I have had to wait over 2 and a half hours, the management staff soothed it over by giving my family and I a free appetizer for our patience.  I hope Burgatory keeps expanding their reach so I won't have to drive so far to enjoy my favorite meal, but until they do, you can bet that my last meal on this earth will be taking place in Burgatory.",

We started with the bourbon bbq wings. They were tasty, although needed a bit of salt or spice or something. But I'm not complaining. Then I got my burger, a build your own which was definitely up to Burgatory standards. I was worried about consistency over several locations but this was spot on.

I opted for the Standard Deluxe (beef, white american, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce) \"pink\".  The burger was tasty, juicy and pink as requested.  The homemade chips were crunchy and good - wished I had requested ranch on the side - that would make the chips even tastier. It was happy hour and draft beer was $2.50 - they have a good selection of draft beers - I went with the Purple Haze. Service was good and if I lived here I'd definitely go back and try a shake and make your own burger- they offer a diverse selection of bread, meats, toppings.  Burgatory may be better than Burger Fi.",

Melty, toasty, meaty goodness. It comes with au jus for dipping, and the sandwich is big enough for someone with a small appetite to take half home and enjoy later (good cold or reheated). Milkshakes are on. point. When I ate in the restaurant, I had a smores milkshake, which was excellent, and had a plain Jane chocolate when I drove home - equally delicious.   I had this for the first time when I was in the area for work, and convinced myself that stopping for to-go on my way home from the same trip was a great idea. Made for a great lunch when I needed to stop for gas, and the milkshake is a great way to pamper yourself when you're in for a long haul and don't want to think about calories. When I picked up, they had an option for car-side pick up, but I went in. Nice to have the choice though.",

I don't like how close the tables are and that customers who are waiting are hovering over you while you're trying to eat.  There's no real sense of comfort. I felt claustrophobic.  I will say the service was great.  The bartenders,  waiters, and hosts were cordial.  The atmosphere is welcoming, but the seating arrangements should be looked at.",

Service was actually great, but the food was utterly disappointing.  I opted for the build your own burger...let's review.  Impossible patty (for all typical eaters, the impossible is a vegan patty that looks and according to my carnivorous friends, tastes like beef), bbq sauce, mushrooms, spinach.  Pretty easy.  It arrives covered in cheese.  No big deal, it happens, so the server politely says it's being remade.   False.  The kitchen scraped off all the cheese.  So I had a cold (desperately under seasoned) patty and virtually none of those extra toppings, which I still paid for.  About an hour later it was obvious they didn't make a new burger because I was sick for the rest of the day.   Do yourself a favor, go to giant eagle and buy burgers to make at home.

Espresso Love and Cookie Monster seemed like popular shakes at our table.   For food my coworker and I split a Trippin' Chicken and Phat Patti's Veggie. The Veggie was alright -- I've had better veggie burgers elsewhere, though the guacamole was a yummy addition. The Trippin' Chicken was absolutely delicious, and everything from the pretzel bun to the black truffle mayo created an explosion of flavor. Highly recommend!   Servers were very attentive and friendly.

    "text": "Went on a Sunday night during prime dinner time and it was packed.  Families were waiting for tables while singles and doubles were taken to tall two-tops and the bar.  It was noisy enough to make conversation across a small two-top difficult.  We considered the make-your-own burger options but decided to try some signatures first.  We were attracted to the idea of a crab burger but had a difficult time finding make-your-own topping combos that would work.  Their signature had remoulade and coleslaw, which are creamy no-gos for my creamy-aversive other half.  I got the Trippin' Chicken with \"Magic Mushroom Crusted Chicken Burger with Creamy Brie, Crispy Fried Leeks, Wild Mushrooms & Black Truffle Mayo on a Pretzel Bun.\"  I wanted this for the mushrooms, brie, and pretzel buns.  I love pretzel bread and their was wonderful.  I also felt like the strong flavors of brie cheese could work on chicken (whereas they might conflict with beef or crab) and I was right: work well brie + chicken did.  Lotsa mushrooms = lotsa yums.  I was hesitant because the burger did not have lettuce or tomato, my favorite parts of a burger normally, but I was not disappointed: trippin' chicken met the as promised descriptor of \"flavor explosion.\"  My other half got the Phat Patti's Veggie with \"Ground Cremini Mushrooms, Lentils, Cashews & Cracked Wheat mixed with about a million secret ingredients. Topped with Smoked Gouda, Baby Arugula, Tomato & Guacamole on a Local Grains Bun.\"  It was good, decent even, but not great, and no where near as good as the Trippin' Chicken.  Here's the thing: a veggie burger is a hard thing because you take a starchy puck and put it between two slabs of starch.  It often doesn't work, and this one didn't.  The bun would have been fine on a greasy cheeseburger, but was too thick and dense for a more delicate and subtly flavored veggie burger.  The veggie patty itself was unusual in a good way: this might be one to go bunless on.  Or pretzel bun--softer bread might have worked better.  There were some flavor sparks, but, alas, no flavor explosion.  We both kept the housemade chips on our orders,  They are very good for chips!  However, next time we would take the $1.50 up charge to get organic greens after we saw platters of salad accompanying burgers to other tables.  It looked so good!  I actually personally prefer to split up my chips/burgers between meals.  If I'm going to indulge, I'd rather do it one at a time.  We walked across the street from an airport hotel and while the walking is a little dicey, we managed.  The area had cross walks and walk signals but no sidewalks.",

I had an order of French fries and the Nutella milkshake plus a cup of coffee to keep me awake for another couple hours. Everything was good and arrived quickly which surprised me since they were still rather busy at 9:30pm.  My lady friend ordered a burger and fries which she said was good and not too greasy. She did however not realize it came with a special sauce (mayo based) and therefore did not eat anything that the mayo came in contact with. I wasn't surprised by this since she can be rather persnickety.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying the impossible burger since I'm veg.",

As a lover of wine, my favorite is the MORTY'S STEAKHOUSE Burger of Peppercorn Crusted Beef with Horseradish Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Haystack Onions & Cabernet Sauce. The crispiness of the haystack onions combined with the rich savory sauce creates quite the indulgent treat. The burgers are pricey, but for the most part worth it. They come with chips which I do not care for. The french fries are an up-charge, but are not my kind of french fry, rather bland and oily. I have not tried much else on the menu, but this is a very popular spot so I'm sure I will be returning to try other things in the future.",

My husband and I enjoy Burgatory, up until Saturday 6/2/18, our server went out of her way to ask my husband if he was vegan/vegetarian, (he ordered the impossible burger)of which he is vegetarian.   She asked him if he was ok with cross contamination. We looked at each other with fear, like what is she talking about? She proceeded to tell us the French fries, of which we eat a lot of are fried in the same grease as the chicken wings and crab cakes.   I saw my husbands face, he was blown away that he had been eating them all this time. Her approach was rough to say the least, she said she was letting him know because she herself is Vegan.  I had no idea the fries bathed with meat products, they can cook however they want to, but if you offer vegetarian options, one would assume there would be vegetarian/vegan fries. Most restaurants do have veg options for fries.     I wrote to Burgatory, they said they'll make sure they convey the fryer sharing with their customers and they make sure they keep their employees up to speed. I have nothing against Burgatory, in fact we will miss them. I really wish they would invest in getting several fryers to accommodate all their customers.",

Their food quality and prep is consistently good and they get the orders out fairly quickly. My beef (no pun intended) from this visit, a business lunch I was hosting, relates to training and management. While clearing the table, our waiter abruptly lifted a tray adorned with an overhanging knife. The knife fell maybe 2 feet and cut my finger. The manager, who I had to ask to speak with, responded with \"accidents happen\" and offered me a bandaid, which I accepted. How about an apology and committing to training the staff to clear a table without injuring the customers? Pretty lame response.",

Our server Larissa was super friendly and patient with us. She checked in a few times during the meal but was never intrusive. Service was also quick.  I got the wagyu burger with pink, with angel dust rub, grilled pineapple, bacon jam, cucumbers, and roasted red peppers without a bun. Since I got so many toppings I was glad I went bunless and could just eat the burger like a steak. I also got a side of jalapeno cornbread. I'm usually pretty sensitive to spicy food, but I didn't find the cornbread spicy at all. It's possible that my burger was flavorful enough to overpower the cornbread, however.  The ladies' room is small, with just 2 stalls, but I didn't have to wait when I needed to go. There is a pretty cool outdoor-ish seating area that's covered with a tent and heated with lanterns; it was super cold the day I came here but with the lanterns, the seating area was perfectly warm.  Great burger place; I'm glad I got to come back!",

We were seated right away but we waited almost half an hour to even get a waiter at our table. Once we got our drinks, my daughter asked for a cup and it didn't come until her soda was pretty much gone. The food, like I said wasn't awful, but the service was ridiculously slow. Others came after us and still left before us. It didn't seem like an especially busy Tuesday night. I probably won't revisit the place.",

But this time mixed it up, and created my own Burger, using the crab as a base and then also got the Burnt Almond Shake (non-alcoholic version). I also substituted coleslaw for the fresh chips - I will not do this again, as found the coleslaw to be bitter to my palate.   Also when the Shake arrived, I didn't notice it a first but there was a fly in my to-go cup. However the sever switched it out when I pointed it to her - the one weird thing is she didnt say she'd comp it until I asked her and then the Mgr okayed it. So happy about that but still think server should have taken the initiative and offered rather than me asking.   Other than these two things, my burger was delightful! I used complimentary things like Cheddar cheese, Arugula, Sweet Onion Rub, Herbed Focaccia and Horseradish Cream to dress the Crab Burger and these taste combinations totally delivered!

They have a great menu of all natural, hormone free burgers. If your not feeling their signature burgers you can always build your own. I love the option of burgers from wagyu, crab, elk, bison, veggie and even a fifty fifty bacon/beef burger. And don't forget the handcrafted milkshakes to go with your burger.   We started with their fork it fries (fresh cut fries, short ribs, cheddar cheese curds and pan gravy). Boy was I in heaven. The fries stayed crispy and the short rib was melt in your mouth. Amazing! We all decided to build our burgers. While everyone chose beef and absolutly loved their burgers, I chose the elk burger and man was it delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly and it had the perfect burger to bun ratio and the brioche bun held up perfectly. This place is definitely worth a trip back. Yummy!!",

We split the \"fork em\" to start which was over the top good, and then wrapped up dinner with a \"meat your maker\".   Good service, great food, and fun crowd. Would definitely stop by again next time I'm in town!",

No thanks.   Premium burger joint... the cooking execution and customer service are poor.  Stay away and seriously go get a burger anywhere else.  +1 star for the chicken strips, they where crispy and hot.  The sweet tea!?!?

After a night of three weather delays ultimately culminating in a canceled flight and waking up on a less than ideal hotel bed situation, we found ourselves tired, angry and hungry. After a quick search of the nearby restaurants, we found ourselves walking into the \"Burgatory\".  First impression, a casual burger joint that has multiple references to their creative word-play of a name and a fun, light hearted atmosphere.   We were seated quickly and met our server, Lexie. Lexie was everything you would want in a server after a horrible night. Funny, helpful and genuine. Lexie happily answered a barrage of questions regarding the burger making process and offered a few helpful recommendations.   After much deliberation our custom burgers were ordered and our appetizer of wings was arriving.   I'll summarize the food experience: amazing.   The wings, burgers and sides are absolutely fantastic. We ended up ordering a third burger just to try an even more extravagant creation.   Between the legitimately above and beyond service provided by Lexie and the amazing food, we left in a great mood. We will be coming back next time we are in town.   I can't recommend this place enough. Try it for yourself and see. Ask for Lexie!!  TL:DR - Great food. Great service.",

When I came in around 7pm, the restaurant was pretty packed, but I didn't have to wait to be seated. However, I had to wait a little to get service.   I glanced the menu and decided to build my own burger and get a side of onion rings (See my picture for my burger). My onion rings came first and were very crispy, and I loved the sauce.  My burger was perfectly cooked. The patty was pink inside and all toppings were very good. Overall, the food was great.   Why 4 stars? The service was slow. It was hard to get attention. The staff was nice.  The portions were huge! It's not cheap (appetizers are a little pricey), but I think it's fair for the burgers you get. I didn't get shake because I was stuffed, and it would be too much sugar, but I would like to try one next time. Other than that, my experience was good. I would come back when I'm in town.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh has a right to brag about this place. It is THE best burger I have had, perhaps I haven't had a good burger yet, but these burgers are the epitome of burgers.  I may have to break it down by the building blocks of burgers. First off you have choices with the Custom Creations that include a wide variety of styles (see the pictures for a menu.) The bread is soft and fresh, warm, toasty but not crunchy or chewy. The meat is juicy, well cooked and flavorful. The toppings and additions to the burger add a flavor and style that is unmatched. The milkshakes will bring the boys to the yard. The milkshakes are thick, oozing with flavor, and a perfect portion. Burgatory isn't just a burger joint, they serve foods that aren't typical to a burger joint; it breaks the burger barrier.   The service is rather minimal since a lot of the work is done by the patron. It isn't quick but its worth the wait.   The interior is nice, dark, and my best guess would be urban. They ask for your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready, it beats carrying those vibrating discs. I have heard the wait is long, but depending on when you go, I guess the wait is different. My wait was only about 10 minutes for 2 people. They have nice art on the wall and an algorithm on the wall to help make your choices. The only downside I see here would be the density of seating. I felt the seating was too crowded. I was about 1.5 feet from my neighbor.   I don't think I've ever had a smile while eating, but this burger just made me so happy. It is definitely a unique place in Pittsburgh and a taste of larger cities that it needs. I will come back as soon as I can.",

    "text": "Holy crap. Burgatory is amazing.   The boyfriend and I flew up to Pittsburgh on a whim for the Steelers playoff game. We passed a Burgatory billboard and liked the name. After getting to the hotel, showering off the airport/airplane funk, we headed right over. We got there about 20 minutes before close, and felt bad about getting there so late, but everyone was really great about it.  Our waitress explained everything to us: you can order a burger on the menu, or create your own. We decided to create our own and used the pad and pencils on the table.   I built a regular beef burger with mushrooms, fried onions, and cheese (also, with two types of pickles on the side). Bf did a buffalo burger with mushrooms, cheese, and other various toppings. The burgers come with chips, but I subbed fries with mine. I also decided to try a side of their baked beans.   Man on man that food is DELICIOUS. My burger was definitely cooked to \"medium\" like I'd asked, and bf's was appropriately rare (I say ew, he says yum). The fries were good, but the burger was the star of the show. I tried one of the chips and those were really good too. The beans had a good flavor, but were too spicy for my wimpy wimpy mouth. I love the plastic pitchfork picks in the burgers. Not gonna lie: I kept mine. It's awesome.   Since we got to Burgatory so late, by the time we finished inhaling our amazing burgers, it was after close. We asked our server if shakes were at all possible? We didn't want anyone to have to re-clean anything on our account. She assured us that we were good to go. I was really intrigued by the Coffee and Donuts shake, but wasn't feeling adventurous enough to actually get the donuts in it. They were happy to leave them out for me, giving me an amazing chocolate-coffee shake. AMAZING HOLY CRAP. I'm drooling just thinking about it. There were small bits of coffee beans inside the shake and the shake was so thick. Oh my god. It was a PERFECT milkshake. Boyfriend got a caramel shake (normally it's caramel-pretzel, but he wasn't feeling the pretzel; again, they were happy to oblige) and he was really impressed. So thick, so creamy, so delicious.   The shake was so good, we came back the next day just to get a milkshake to go.  It was just as excellent on the second time around. Oh man.   It would be weird to fly from Texas to Pittsburgh for a hamburger and milkshake, right? Because I totally would...",

There are so many options that no matter what you crave, you can have it! I am a bit of a purist....I minimize toppings and this is terrific because the meat here is up to the challenge. Service is attentive and friendly. Be aware that there are extra charges for add-ons to your sandwich, but I consider it worth every cent!",

Plenty of options for any type of burger you can think of. They have a menu of prepared burgers or you can build your own monster. I chose the Buffalo Bison burger, and it was absolutely delicious. The meat had great flavor, the buffalo gave it a nice little kick while a little ranch cooled it back down, the veggie toppings were fresh, and the sweet potato chips were a great side. Interested in trying out the Elk burger next time!",

Over to yelp of course to check out the reviews. Definitely put it on our try list while there. You can design your own burger which I took advantage of. You fill out a slip and put what you want on it from the bun to the meat to toppings.  Hubby went with a burger from the menu as they had some interesting ones to choose from. We also ordered the truffled gorgozola pommes fries. WOW Again. I loved it all- from the little devilish stakes they put in your burger, to the atmosphere inside. I also had one of their heavenly shakes with a huge marshmallow on top.  If this is purgatory sign me up!  Hubby finished off the meal by asking if I would consider moving here just for the place. While I give it high ratings, I think I will wait until they come south and build one here in Raleigh!",

    "text": "Crab cake with shells, greasy mess of fries, and nasty beans turned a 4 star experience into just being 2.  It was a Saturday... lunch... noon... 20 min wait as advertised... text message system worked as advertised... the \"thank you\" message after we left seemed over kill.  Waitress was super fast... but when she saw we were discussing the choose your own burger pad she didn't even try to up sell us to the specials... we were half way done when a table near us sat and we heard all that we missed.  Shakes were as advertised... I wish we hadn't been driving... the alcoholic selection looked like mudslide heaven!  Straws are REALLY large in diameter and handled the pretzel bits of the Caramel Pretzel really well... 1 $6 shake was more than enough for 2 people... it was like starting a meal with dessert but the huge glasses of water carried us through the rest of the meal and were refilled promptly.  Frites with Parmesan Peppercorn - cute small bucket with a big problem... so much parm that it sweat out a TON of grease and the bottom 1/4 of the bucket was inedible... and it wasn't like you could get a handle on any of the fries... none of them were longer than 1.5 inches...so it was a bucket of ends?  Build your own burger should come with some warnings... the waitress told us that Brioche is just white bread \"in case you didn't know\"... um... no... it's not... but... um... yes... that's what it was... nothing eggy or sweet or any texture resembling Brioche... except the way the bun is formed.  You can skip the run section... we didn't taste the sweet onion rub on either a beef or a crab burger... and skip the provolone if you like that... it was kind of chewy... no taste... the cheddar was ok  Beef burger came out medium as requested... tasted great... BBQ sauce was great... baked bean side dish was straight up nasty... we couldn't decide what it was made of... and didn't care... 1 bite each... left the rest.  Crab burger... mostly bread in pockets... 2 dime size pieces of shell... more or less tasteless... the garlic mayo was nice... pickle chips were good... tried to eat just the crab cake to see if we could taste anything... and I mean anything... on it's own... nope... finished it only because of the cost... and the time... and not wanting to go somewhere else on a Saturday at 2... because by then it was 2 pm... and we were ready for any place quieter!  Jalapeno cornbread had lots of corn kernels and more pepper taste than heat... the honey butter was puzzling... the cornbread wasn't sweet on it's own... we felt like we missed something in the story behind the sides... not that there are any explanations of them on the menu.  We don't live in the area and would not give it a second try... there are literally dozens of other options that we could have spent $40 (before tip) on 2 burgers, 1 order of fries, 2 sides, and 1 milkshake.",

    "text": "We have been to other Burgatory restaurants and really enjoyed our burgers. Here we were asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. I think it was rare, some pink, or no pink. We asked for some pink similar to what we did in Red Robin and other places who usually ask do you want it done based on the rare, medium, well done standards. We all asked for some pink, but all our burgers came out cold raw in the middle. Not good. They were happy to redo but this was just a turnoff. Trying to keep up with the backlog of people waiting, my suspicion is they were cooked too fast, too high a heat, crisp on the outside, raw on the inside. The remade burgers were just as good as you could hope for. Just wish it would have been done on one take and not two. Will not fear returning and will do so, if not here then at another location.",

Our waiter (wish I remembered his name) was EXCELLENT and was always back checking on us, gave great recommendations, and showed that he really cared.  Next, the food. I'd heard rave reviews about this place so I was excited for the chance to try. We started with the gorgonzola truffle fries.....again wow. I am not usually a big fry person, but I devoured these flavor-packed bad boys. (Also great to get them 1/2 off during happy hour!) For the burger side of things, a friend and I ordered two different things and split so I got to try the Crab Cake burger (from the menu) as well as the PB burger with Habanero jelly. LOVED them both, but I think the PB burger won.   To cap it all off, the shakes are definitely worth it. I got the S'mores variety and was quite pleased.  Safe to say I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

All draft beers are quality micros, but expect to pay $6-7 for a pint.  But above all'm my biggest gripe is the noise level.  We frequent a lot of \"sports bars\" but this is by far the loudest.  The technoish music is way too loud.  I had to lean into the waitress to hear her. Forget conversation over dinner.",

I always get the Burger of the Day and it never disappoints.  If the BOD doesn't float your boat, go for the Farmer Brown - I'm a person who loves fried eggs on my sandwiches and if you're here, you already jumped off the diet bandwagon and are rolling downhill to a delicious river of craft beer and meat, so go all in.  The burgers come with homemade potato chips and I love them so much that I don't miss fries (though you can fries here); they chips are crunchy and salty with just a touch of oil still on them to give them that extra crispiness.  And the shakes... If you're old enough, spike a shake and don't look back.  I'm not sure if the shot makes a difference, but the liquor actually cuts the sweetness of the ice cream so it works really well.  Aside from one time here, I've always had to wait at least 30 minutes for dinner, but the table turnover is pretty speedy and once you're seated, the servers don't rush you through your meal.  They have great servers and fresh, unique flavors on their burgers and shakes.  I don't think it can get much better than this.",

But after our most recent flight in from Pittsburgh we stopped for a late night dinner at the bar at Burgatory and were extremely impressed.  My husband said his burger was the best he'd had (sorry, don't remember which... the one with peanut butter).  I had the chicken burger with mushrooms, truffle rub and brie.  It was delicious, but pretty intense.  So much truffle taste that my mouth went numb after eating it.  We opted for potato salad and baked beans for sides, but I sort of regret not just getting fries (I was trying to be \"healthy\"). Washed everything down with a nice cold Yuengling (which we can't get where we live :) ).  I'd definitely go back.  Great location if you're headed from the airport into the city.

I can see a lot of people LOVING this place. The service was awesome. Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly too. I made my own burger for the first time which turned out to be a decent burger so that was kinda cool. The shakes though were nothing to rave about. I mean I already had a ginormous burger + appetizers + cocktails so when you add that milkshake to the equation which I did, you bet I was in some serious pain by the end of the meal. I couldn't even walk up straight to the car. It felt like a dinner you give someone in a death row! If you're up for some gluttonous meal, the Burgatory is the perfect place for ya.

    "text": "Cool place with really good food. We were recently in Pittsburgh, passed by this place looking for somewhere to eat and liked the name, pretty clever, so we had to check it out, and so glad we did! The place had a really cool vibe to it, the burgers we got (elk and bison) were absolutely delicious, and the \"fork it\" appetizer was great! They give you fortune cookies with funny messages after your meal, which in no way makes sense but that's the point, I love it. Will definitely go again next time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I love their milkshakes!! I have been here only a handful of times, but I never really had a bad experience. The burgers are good and the bread seems to always be fresh. You get a wide range of variety when it comes to the \"build your own burger\". You get chips with your meals, so if you're a fry person heed my warning! Portions are also reasonable, but in my opinion this place is overpriced. It seems to be good quality though, so that's probably why. Milkshakes can run around $6-$9 depending if you get alcohol or not. Still good food though definitely give it a try!",

    "text": "Came here with two friends on a Friday night.   First of all, the waitress was very nice. It was my first time there, and she explained everything.  My friends love the Truffled Gorgonzola Fries. We ordered some. To be honest, I didn't love them. My female friend and I both got a customer burger- I enjoyed it. Her husband got ribs, which he absolutely loved.  The meal was average/good up until the awesome milkshake that we all shared (HUGE!)...we got the smores, and it was absolutely amazing! That pushed it to the 4 star realm!  Would definitely go back again.",
