    "text": "This is absolutely and without question one of my very favorite lunch spots in downtown Pittsburgh. It is tucked away in the Steel Building tunnel (heading to the Subway station). This is one of the best hidden gems in the burgh.    The food here is just tremendous. It is home cooked daily in small batches so it is always fresh and flavorful. You never quite know what they may have any given day, skewer chicken one day, lamb the next, meatballs tomorrow. Who knows. All I do know is that it has never let me down when it comes to flavor. It is always well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It can also be somewhat intimidating to order, but don't let that stop you. The folks are incredibly accommodating and happy to help out, though they did finally add a \"menu board\" to help out. Basically though its just an ala carte setup with several rice options, salads, vegetables, hummus, grape leaves, baba ganoush etc. Also when available the home made hot sauce is spectacular.   The real star here though is Josh, the owner and chef. He is a charming, charismatic guy who makes it a point to interact with every person who wants to eat there. Walks first timers through the whole experience and gives you more than enough reason to want to come back beyond the delicious food. Tip there, don't be afraid to mention it's your first time. Tip 2, it's cash only. Normally this would tick me off and cost a place a star, but here, i've forgotten to bring cash a few times and without exception Josh has told me, \"no worries, pay me next time\". Made me a customer for life.  Try this place!! You will not regret it.",

I know absolutely nothing about Turkish food so I cannot judge its authenticity, but regardless, I really enjoyed the food.    I told the guy (I assume he was the owner/manager based on his demeanor) I didn't know anything about Turkish food and wasn't sure what exactly to try.  He asked me if I have any allergies and proceeded to fill my tray with items he recommended.     The food was very good and great value for $10.  The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because there were no menus or labels on the food.  I understand that they recently relocated and that perhaps they didn't get a chance to fully setup their signs yet.   Either way, I won't let the lack of menus deter me from going back.  Great food and service!",

    "text": "Had lunch for the first time today at Istanbul, in the bottom of the USX building. All my coworkers have been raving about this place for weeks. My boyfriend brought up the idea of Turkish food to me just yesterday and I was super hesitant. But I'm so glad I decided to give this spot a try.  I went with my more seasoned coworker (I heard the ordering process was.... confusing, at best.... for newbies) and kind of watched how he ordered. They had choice for hot plates (if you wanted chicken you had to go outside - guess they're selling it out on the plaza), cold plates, etc. I went with the cold veggie plate and I made sure to mention it was my first time dining there.  The woman behind the counter was super great and kind of led me along all the food stations, asking if I had food allergies and inquiring what I liked. I'm not typically a fan of grape leaves but I found myself actually enjoying the one she gave me.  I think by the time she loaded up my container, I had some great salad, a grape leave, some orange rice-looking stuff that was great, killer hummus, some eggplant, a bean salad, some green bean stuff, yogurt sauce, beets and probably some other stuff I'm missing.  I forced myself to only eat half.... and trust me, I could've wolfed down the whole plate without stopping. Most of the time I didn't even know what I was eating, I just knew all the flavors were fantastic. I'm intensely looking forward to lunch tomorrow because that means leftovers. The whole meal cost me $9 - which for me, is a little high. I don't think I could make this a weekly stop.... but probably a once-a-month treat.  Check it out, even if you're hesitant. It was fabulous.",

It was fantastic. I added hummus for an extra $1 and the flavors were all exactly what I was craving. Everything looked so good I had a hard time deciding what to order!

Then one time I ask the elder lady to add more white sauce she charged me $2. $2 with no any other sides : ( .

Two things make this place truly awesome (which is the basic expectation from places you go to eat) - the food and the people. It might be a small 'fast food' shop in the basement of a corporate tower, but boy the food is good. They probably have the most perfectly cooked, juicy chicken I have ever eaten at a place where I have to struggle to push my meal cost to two digits. Add to that the Bulgar rice, side salad and a plethora of traditional sides and veges, and you have meal that will blow you away (and make it hard to finish). The sauces (especially the home-made hot sauce - which  I think is made fresh everyday) also are an excellent addition to the meal.  The place is run by a family, and you are fed like you are part of the family (read it feels like a complete home cooked meal). The owner (Josh) is a wonderful guy - he cares more about you enjoying a satisfying meal, than taking your money for it. Multiple times he has told me to pay later if his CC machine doesn't work, and keeps throwing in free stuff all the time.   Yes, this place doesn't have the best ambiance or even table service. Yes, this place has become a bit of a hole in the wall. Yes, this place runs out of food by 12:40 PM on most days. But, if you do manage to make it there on time and get your hands on a box full of delicious, you will leave leave happy and surely come back again.",

I got a chicken salad and the charming Turkish woman (totally assuming, but she seemed authentic!) hooked me up with eggplant, chick peas, and potatoes on top of my salad dressed with a creamy white yogurt dressing.  The best part was the potatoes and the eggplant.  They were flavorful, tender, and a perfect compliment to the crunchy lettuce.  The chick peas were nice and bright as well and a great counterpart to the \"heavier\" flavors.  The chicken would have been my favorite part in all of it's tender, juicy glory, but we had the bottom of the crock and some pieces were a little petrified (yknow, that crust that the edge of crock pots impart).  I would definitely return, though.",

Turns out they only take cash so I had to sprint back upstairs to the ATM. By the time I got back and was ready to order, almost all the food they had was sold out (the sign of a very popular joint!) but she was kind enough to quickly make some fresh salad for me. When she learned I had never been there before, she excitedly put together a plate of what was left, which was salad, chicken and beef meatballs, chicken shawarma, hummus and some beans.  I loved every bite!  The ingredients were so fresh and flavorful.  The food clearly made from scratch and with lots of love. I am so jealous of the lucky folks who work in this building.",

After seeing the delicious food he brought back from there occasionally he to me and some fellow co-workers over. We all went knowing we wanted to get the falafel, but were surprised to see so many delicious looking sides as well!  I had the falafel wrap. It was incredible. Like, I could eat this every day of the week increadible. Josh loaded up all of our plates with plenty of different sides as well. I'm not exactly sure what everything was, but I know i loved the garlic carrot salad and the grape leaves. He also let us sample some of the chicken, which was great. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items.   Getting to their location in the belly of the US Steel building can be a little confusing. I never would have gone had it not been for the recommendation of my co-worker. It'd be awesome to see them have their own location! My only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is having to find seating in a food court area. But I've heard they plan on opening in a new, more easily accessible location with more seating. Fingers crossed!  Can't wait to go back!",

The cashier was super nice and gifted my lunch on yesterday. The lamb was full of flavor and the red sauce added a nice kick. Although there's always a line, service is pretty fast. There's other options of salads and chicken if the lamb wrap isn't your thing. If you're ever around the area, do yourself a favor and stop by. Thanks for showing this Georgia girl lots of love!!",

I was lucky enough to try their Doner kebab (which is known as Gyro in US but Turkish version is much tasty IMO) before they open formally. I also know their meze varieties are delightful from their other location in downtown. Since they are close by I'll probably visit them very often and try their other specials.

If you don't work at the Steel Building, or you aren't familiar with the underbelly of the building like me, you might be completely lost. Especially if the security guard hasn't even heard of the business!  When finally found, it was pure joy! Although it doesn't look like they have quite the room or set-up they used to, I will admit it looks a little cleaner (which is a good thing). I was pumped to get my normal chicken salad with beets, white sauce and two grape leaves, all for $10 bucks! And the massive amount they give you, my lord, you could eat for two days!  Now, while it was still delicious, one thing I noticed was that my chicken had to be bottom of the barrel chicken. A lot of it was overcooked and too hard to even eat. Bummer. Why would I go back? Because I know it's still awesome and I'm crossing my fingers this was an \"off\" day. That's how much I love this place! Five star experience hopefully next time...",

The food is very good, authentic  and the service is very pleasant. My only piece of feedback is that their menu system is a bit confusing and it gets very busy during the lunch exacerbating the situation.  I ordered a mixed lamb & chicken pita sandwich which comes with a pre-dressed simple salad. I added a few cold items on the salad for an extra charge. I went with the baba, eggplant and white beans. I told them it was my \"highly anticipated first visit\" and they gave me smaller samples of 3 other sides. Everything was really good I thought the pita itself (and the spicy sauce they put on it) as well as the white beans were the highlights. Service was quick but if you're in a rush pass on the pita/wraps as the rice/salad platters move much faster.  As many other mention it's cash only so grab cash at the ATMs on the way down. (To find the location enter the Steel building on street level and go behind the escalators up to the next level to find another set of escalators down. Once on the next level down go around the escalators through the doors. Istanbul Grille is at the end of the hall pass the other restaurants.)",

Everything is fresh and there's enough of a selection that you probably won't get sick of it.  What I do get a little sick of, however, is the discrepancy with pricing. I always get the $8 cold plate, or the option #3, which is the salad and 3 sides. If Josh is there, you get extra sides. If someone else is there, you can get your extra sides but it's suddenly $10.  That's fine, because I would normally leave $10 anyway, I just wish it were the same no matter who took your order.   I hate to complain but at least that's the only complaint!  My favorite side is the beets, idk what they do to those beets but I often crave them! No matter what you order, make sure to get a little dollop of the white sauce on top. So good!  If you're in the area, get your cash and run to Istanbul!!",

For $10 you get a protein, rice, salad, and it is AMAZING.  The food tasted fresh and the flavors were so powerful and bright.  I think my favorite thing was the diversity of flavors and temperatures.  The rice was excellent as well as the chicken, the sides both cold and hot were eye opening to the Turkish food palate.

The hot cabbage, cauliflower, and green bean dishes ended up being my favorite, though the cold mushroom salad, eggplant salad, and many others were tasty as well.

I didn't know what a lot of the side dishes were, so they gave me a ton of them to sample FOR FREE.   Everything I've had there has been excellent. I always get the chicken. I have no idea what seasoning they use, but the meat is delicious, tender, and flavorful. The bulgur is cooked perfectly. As for the sides, get the creamed shredded beets. You won't regret it.

Literally every mouthful was make-you-cry delicious. Mentioning I was a first-timer caused the server to give me extra little tastes of all the things she liked best, and out-of-this-world begins to describe her choices. 5 stars just doesn't seem like enough, frankly.",

You will recognize both the staff and the food but you no longer have to eat from Styrofoam takeout containers using plastic utensils.  If you order the \"Little, Little Into the Middle\" for an appetizer, you will see many of the same items that you love.  It includes 9 items, Chef's Choice, but trust the Chef.  It is all wonderful.  For a main course, I had the Iskender.  It was huge.  An open face Gyro covered with tomato sauce with a side of yogurt.  I almost could not finish it but it was so good, I had to.  My companion ordered a Spring Salad.  She loved it.  We had the Three Milk Cake for dessert.  It is hard to describe.  Cake with flavored milk and caramel.  I don't know how it stays together but it works.  Service was good.  They are very friendly people who make you feel like family.",

First, the customer service here is amazing.  Every worker is very helpful and friendly.  If it is your first time they will help you and not make you feel awkward or rushed.  The first time I ever went here I didn't realize it was cash only until after my meal had been partially made.  I told the worker this and was preparing to walk away before she told me to not worry about it.  I was confused at first but she said to just make sure to come back and eat again and not to worry about paying this time.  I can't think of any other establishment in downtown Pgh that would do this.  I was sure to go back the next day, both for another meal and to thank the workers.  The options are all very fresh and authentic Turkish/Greek food.  My favorite is the gyro with white sauce and the side salad they give you.  Both the chicken and lamb gyro are delicious.  Very filling and flavorful.  The side salad is also very unique and goes perfect with their food.  I usually throw in a grape leaf or two as well.",

The tapas were all different from each other, good sized, and were very flavorful. Grape leaves are either hit or miss and Istanbul Grille hit. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Kabob. It was well cooked and fairly tasty. Overall I felt it was above average and leaned more towards Greek influences than Middle Eastern.",

Carrot salad, beet salad, hummus, beans salad, grape leaves just to name a few. All of the flavors were coming alive in your mouth. You can tell that everything is home made and fresh. We then has the lentil soup and the owner suggested we squeeze a little fresh lemon on top....it was Devine. Then for dinner I had a special Gyro made with beef and lamb..once you taste this you will never settle for a frozen Gyro again. This Gyro was so fresh and the flavors were subtle not over powering the flavor of the meat. My friend had the lamb kebab also fresh and delicious. Not gamey at all. Both dishes came with rice and lots of fresh veggies. To end we had a dessert that was out of this world. It was made with shredded wheat, a special white cheese inside, a sweet water sauce and pistachio drizzled on top. Unlike anything you have ever tasted. Not too sweet, just right way to end a perfect dinner.The atmosphere was very pleasant, soft music in the background and the owners,brother and sister, walked around to each table chatting with all of the patrons and making them feel like part of the family. You do not want to miss this gem. They have something for everyone from vegan to meat eaters and everything in between.  It is BYO and they accept credit cards. Update : they just catered my Christmas party and it was amazing! See pics.",

We started with the Chef's choice 9-item tapas platter, which is a must for the first time diner.  The meat on both the Lamb Adana and Beyti was seasoned very well throughout.  Be sure to ask for the spicy dipping sauces!  Dessert was spectacular - we had the 3-milk cake and burnt-top putting and will probably have to get both on subsequent visits.  The restaurant is currently BYOB because unfortunately they are located on the Edgewood side of Braddock which has a prohibition-era liquor license process. . .",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to get to try Istanbul Grille recently.  My friend and I wanted to try everything.  But settled on getting and sharing the babaghonush and hummus along with sharing the mix grill - so that we could try as much as possible.  The babaghonush was a pepper one - but it was fantastic.  Honestly I think it's one of my favorites I've had in a long time.  The hummus was phenomenal, of course.  There was enough for both of us to eat, and have some to take home.  The Mix grill was PERFECT to share with 2 people.  We got to try all the meats we were interested in trying.  My personal favorite was the Chicken Kebab (Honestly not what I expected to be a favorite!)  it has SO much flavor - so good.  My friend's favorite was the Kofte.  The yaprak doner was fantastic as well with deep flavors.  I have had doners all over Europe - but this was my favorite.  Istanbul Grille has a few locations - if you have a chance to try it - do it.",

We had another great meal here last Friday and tried a few more delicious menu items. This restaurant has excellent prices for such tasty and fresh food. In case anyone is wondering, this restaurant is NOT at all affiliated with the other Turkish restaurant down the street at Forbes Ave.  Well made food with quality ingredients, comfortable atmosphere, friendly wait staff, able to accommodate a variety of dietary preferences and restrictions, byob, excellent value. We tried the appetizer sampler and got to taste 10 items- all of them were delicious, as was all of the beef, lamb, and chicken on the mixed grille entree. There is no doubt that we will be back and can't wait to bring friends and family here with us.",

Everyone loved their food. We shared the vegan eggplant spread for the pita--highly recommend. They didn't have soup yet, so I just went with the falafel appetizer as my entree. It was definitely enough food even though it was a small plate. The gyro comes deconstructed and is a large portion. If you're too full for dessert, you can take some baklava home for later! I'd like to come back to try the chef's appetizer sampler other reviewers have raved about.",

Their baklava is wonderful! I can't believe we ordered this much food but you know when you're full and just can't stop eating? Yup, that's what this place will do to you. You roll out of here and just want momma to put you to bed. The owner came out and joked around with us a bit which added to the comfort of the ambiance.

We got there just after 5pm on a Friday evening and there were about 3 tables full. We got the chefs 10 tapas, zucchini pancakes, the falafel with side of rice and the baklava. Everything has a lot of flavour. Food as pretty good. One of the best Turkish restaurant I've been to. Just would have preferred a little spice. The rice oh man!! So much flavour.  Very very good. We got a mix of the white and bulger (?) wheat rice man was it amazing.  The service was so-so. Looked like there was only 1 server? Granted they weren't too busy at 5 pm but I can see they would get busy. The server was too busy even with a few tables. She never came to check how the food is or asked how the food is. Just gave us what we ordered. Also some parts of the restaurant gets pretty cold. We were sitting right next to the air vent and it was freezing.  Also missed the usual falafel rice and salad combo. Wished they had that on the menu but everything has to ordered separately.",

I ordered the tapas platter to start and was not disappointed. I then moved onto a chicken doner that was quite solid, though I could have used more rice (I love rice).   The ambiance and service is good with easy access to parking nearby. The restaurant is BYOB so you should feel free to bring your favorite adult beverage. The price is a bit high for what you get and the restaurant is a bit small. I am not sure if they take reservations, but it would be a good idea to ask if you are going to have a large party.

This is the type of restaurant that will make your day. The food is great. We had the mixed grill and all of the meats were great but the lamb chops were a blessing. They were the best lamb chops I've ever had. Expertly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully tender. You should eat these. Everything on the plate is wonderful and different from the food served in the downtown locations. They did keep all the same tappas, such as the hummus, bean salad and babba we all know and love. They have falafel and zucchini cakes too.  The best part of the experience is the owner Josh. Stay for tea.",

I ordered a meat meal of lamb with bulga rice a side of seasoned lentils, white beans and salad. Who knew lamb could be so juicy and tender??? The meal comes with two side vegetables. I had humus, finely shredded beet salad and seasoned garbanzo beans. All of this incredible food is placed in one container and topped with a spicy or mild sauce and a tzatziki type of sauce but better.  The restaurant is like Qdoba and others where you request the type of base (Meat or Veggie) then tell the person what sides and sauces you would like. You then take your food to go. For $10 - $11 you get MORE than your monies worth and the family gives warm friendly old school service with a smile which is rare.

    "text": "I've wanted to try the Istanbul grill for quite some time since it had so many great reviews.  Unfortunately,  I was duped by the common misperception by Pittsburghers that large portions means the same thing as high quality.  I ordered a lamb pita to eat out on the plaza with a Jazz band playing.  Atmosphere = A+.  They were out of salad.  Seriously?  You can't send someone downstairs to the indoor location to get more?  At least they comped a drink, fine.  The pita comes overstuffed with meat.  A very hearty portion fir $8.  The guy serving it ia quite pleasant so I sit down and bite into it with anticipation of the flavors I read about in the reviews.  That's when it becomes a disappointment.  It wasn't bad per se.  I'd actually eat it again if I were with people who wanted to eat there.   But it wasn't actually good either.  Specifically,  the meat was cut way too thick.  And then after I asked for light onions and light hot sauce, he simply drenched it in (what I assume is) yogurt sauce without asking.  Way to much, yech.  I'm not expecting world class cuisine at a stand in Steel Plaza, but this is on par with an exceeding average gyro you can get all over the place.  There are at least a dozen places in the city that are much better for this type of food - though this may be as good as it gets downtown.   If you want a very large portion of decent food for a reasonable price, this is your restaurant.   If you want above average, great tasting food, don't bother with this place.",

Their specialty is fresh Turkish cuisine - chicken shawarma, tabbouleh, bulgur and wheat rice, incredible fresh vegetables, artfully seasoned salads, grape leaves, and much more. There's no menu, you order cafeteria-style, which gives you an opportunity to sample all the options.  What really makes this place special, though, are the staff. Josh (the owner) and his colleagues are extremely friendly and caring people. I don't think I've ever had lunch there without seeing them give someone a discount or freebie. They treat regulars and \"newbies\" alike very well and are just wonderful people to be around.  Also, the tabbouleh is amazing. Now if they'd just serve Turkish coffee...!",

The owners are amazing and the food is fresh. The first time I was there, I had no idea what to order so the girl working the counter helped me out and gave me anything I wanted to try. The next time I came back, the owner, I think his name is Josh, gave my coworker and I a free slice of cheesecake. They are just the epitome of customer service. And you will definitely not go hungry. They pack the boxes so full that it's impossible to eat the whole thing. They have the best hummus I've ever tasted and I highly recommend the chickpea salad, the lentils, meatballs, and the baba ganoush. I''ve been wanting to try the chicken, but they haven't had it either time I've been there. I'll definitely be back so I'm sure I'll get to it!",

This was my first visit to Pittsburgh and I wanted to try some of the local cuisine.  I have never eaten Turkish food and the restaurant was in walking distance from my hotel, so I thought I would give it a try.  It seems to be a family owned business.  The gentleman that helped me with my order was the owner and cook.  It was close to their closing time and I told him that I was not familiar with Turkish food and wanted to know what he recommended.  He told me all of it was good, so he fixed me a plate with a little bit of several items for me to try.  When it was time to pay I realized he only accepted cash and I only had my debit card.  Instead of making a big deal about it or embarrassing me, he told me to not worry about it and just enjoy the food.  I felt bad because it was my last day in town and I went there before heading to the airport.  After eating the food I felt worse because the food was great!  The chicken was tender and well seasoned. The vegetable rice and green beans were delicious.  The food is definitely authentic and homemade.  He even makes his own hot sauce which gives the food the right amount of heat and flavor.  I want to thank the owner for his generosity and his great food.  I have sent you a check for the food and I hope you receive it soon.  I wish you and your restaurant much success in the future!! Cok tesekkur ederim!   If you are visiting Pittsburgh and in the mood for homemade Turkish food, check out Istanbul Grille.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.",
