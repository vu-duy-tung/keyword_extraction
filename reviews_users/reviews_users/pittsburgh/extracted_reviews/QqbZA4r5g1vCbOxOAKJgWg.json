She made our dining experience very uncomfortable and I couldn't wait to leave this restaurant (which took awhile because she didn't seem like she wanted to serve our table). I'm very understanding of customer service and how difficult the job is but if I hear and see you smiling and laughing with the table behind us, then I expect the same service. What a shame.",

We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations; but you will not find any of that here. They are simple burgers that have amazing taste. I repeat, do not have your hopes up for something that will dazzle you, but the quality is great. The meat was awesome, cooked to perfection. There was nothing gross about the meat, no crunchy or fatty bites.   Get the home fries.... Old school Heinz bottles where you have to hit the 57.   This place is worth trying. It seemed like a type of clientele that have been going there for years. Time for the younger hipsters to revive it?  Try it.",

It might be the inciting smell of meat wafting from the grill (home is where the meat is), or it's the way you feel welcome the second you walk through the door.   Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh legend, but I hadn't been there for the first time until about 6 month ago. The wood interior is cozy, and I've never seen the place anything but packed. That being said, it's never taken more than 10 minutes to be seated.   I can't tell you about anything on the menu but the burgers. I can tell you though, the burgers are amazing. They come on massive buns with all the fixings, and a cup or mayo or mustard. While I dabble in the breakfast burger, I almost always get a standard cheese burger. It's consistently delicious.   I think the one thing that ticks people off is that Tessaro's serves home fries instead of french fries. DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED--those sliced up potatoes are delicious, and in no way do I miss a plate full of freedom fries.    Judging by their lunch menu, Tessaro's has a decent sandwich game at lunch. I'll be the judge of that at a later time.",

This restaurant must not know that things have changed and they have competition and they need to step into the new millennium ,if they expect to maintain customers. The last time I was there I had a similar situation rude hostess ,rude waitress ,but I thought possibly that was just a bad day ,so I would give it another chance to see what happened. Walking in the door found a paper cup on the ground in front of the store, rather than can contribute to the litter already filling liberty Avenue ,thought it would be a good idea to pick it up and have it placed in the garbage. Walk in ,not greeted stood by the front door saw a menu sitting on the counter ,picked it up starting reading the menu. Before I knew it a woman approached and said \"who said you could just take a menu like that, and don't think you're bringing your garbage into our restaurant\". I found this garbage in your restaurant was trying to be nice. It was very obvious that they do not appreciate their customers we turned around and left and will never return again. Went to a restaurant on Butler Street in Lawrensville and they appreciate their customers the food was great and I suspect they know how the service business needs to be done now. Good Luck Tasarros your days are numbered.",

I had not been here since 12/2011 so it had been awhile and my hubby and I were looking to grab a late lunch yesterday since the weather had been so awful (we decided to go closer to home).    My MEDIUM (AKA pink in the center) burger was still alive.  It was mushy, bleeding and not medium for sure.  I am not a complainer, rather I just will not be back for a burger.  Chips were good.  The last time I must have had the home fries and something told me to not order them this time.  I am glad I opted for the chips as there was no way that they would have been able to ruin my meal more.    I am going to have to stick with other burgers for now.  I am utterly disappointed in the \"best burger in the 'Burgh\" according to some people.    On a positive note, the service was good... unfortunately, if you cannot get what you are famous for right, it is going to be hard to keep people coming back.",

But Tessaro's was surprisingly crowded for a Tuesday evening right after the holidays. However, the place was still fairly quiet and low key, and we only waited 5-10 mins for a table.   The 6 of us were seated in the booth in front of the kitchen, and it was pretty cozy. Most of us had burgers, and we all enjoyed our meals. I had some kind of bacon cheeseburger and it was rather delicious. The home fries were just ok, but only because I'm not crazy about home fries. Tessaro's doesn't have french fries on the menu, so home fries were my best bet. I think they also serve potato salad as a side, which I don't eat, so I didn't try any. But those who do like potato salad rave about Tessaro's.   Service was great, especially considering there were 6 of us and the place was crowded. Prices were moderate, from what I remember.   Overall, it was a great experience and I'll be back.",

    "text": "To hear Pittsburghers speak of Tessaro's in Bloomfield or to read most Pittsburgh Best-Of lists one would expect to find the worlds best burger here. What you find instead is a decent, run of the mill, average burger. The meat is pretty good and certainly juicy but rather lacking in seasoning and the toppings don't do much for the overall experience. I've had burgers that are 4 or 5 star burgers, just not here.  I was famished the last time I ate at Tessaro's and so was my husband. I'd just spent the entire day at Shadyside Hospital having a minor procedure and hadn't been able to eat since the night before. We didn't get to Tessaro's until 3pm and both of us would have literally eaten anything at that point. While I spent the day waiting, I'd read one of those infamous Best Burger in the Burgh lists online and had been daydreaming about a big juicy burger literally for hours & Tessaro's was right down the street.  The bacon bleu cheese burger was on special that day so we both jumped. Peculiar that they offer the bleu cheese wet or dry. Guessing the wet is bleu cheese dressing and I like my bleu cheese straight up, so easy decision. Side of coleslaw for me, fries for hubby.   We both remarked that we expected it to taste better than it did. The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on. At one point, I even put coleslaw on it to try and wake it up.   As mentioned, the meat itself was good but I'm sorry even the best burger needs seasoning and flavorful toppings. If the bacon and bleu cheese had been 1st rate, this would have been a completely different rating and experience.",

But there is something about the place, that doesn't make my short list of favorites.  It's usually pretty crowded, and the bar/waiting area is limited.  Leads to alot of shuffling around and awkwardness.  Also I'm always underwhelmed by their sides.  I end up ordering potato salad or something else that I'm underwhelmed by.  They have home fries, but I may just be too much of a traditionalist and want a decent french fry.  As someone that lives in the neighborhood - they do provide a lovely aroma of grilled meat almost every day of the week.  As a result - I am hungry all of the time.  But...if I want a burger and a beer - I head down the block to Lot 17 and get some options, better atmosphere and sweet potato fries.",

The host (normally the owner - check out his fantastic Heinz bottle tie that he wears every Friday) takes the number in your party and actually remembers your face.  People come here normally for the burgers.  The patty is incredibly juicy (they ground it in the restaurant, not delivered, very fresh and you can taste it).  The lettuce crisp.  Tomatoes no exception.  I can't comment on cheeseburgers since I don't like cheese in them.  I have been here for Thursday Ribs night and it's absolutely fantastic, particularly the chicken ribs.

    "text": "For the juiciest, tastiest, big-time burger in Steeltown, Tessaro's is second to none. When home I always go there with my pops and bros.  Tessaro's fires everything up on an aged hardwood grill you can smell two blocks away.  The place is a Pittsburgh classic, serving great food for as long as anyone remembers. Go with your family and you're bound to run into at least three people you know and ACTUALLY want to see. Running into friends is inevitable...that's Tessaro's old school charm.   The waitresses are awesome and have been there forever. The daily specials are a go to: fresh Fish, Salads, Sandwiches, Barbecue, Mexican, etc. Honestly, you can't go wrong!   There's typically a wait at the entrance, never more than 15 minutes. Head to the bar, enjoy a drink and start schmoozing. Good conversation starters are the Steelers kicking ass or the Pirates being shitty.",

    "text": "In theory, Tessaro's is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice, it's not very pleasant to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.  The burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.    They don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \"we have fries here!\" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?  I've come to believe that everyone at Tessaro's is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away. But you  keep going back.   Have some pity for the poor cursed Tessaro workers, and just go up the street to BRGR, or downtown to Winghart's.",

Yes, maybe it is a local institution, but it is not worthy of one of the highest yelp ratings for a restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The burger was mildly admirable.  I'll trust their word that they use high quality ground beef, but it's still ground \"beef\", not ground sirloin or anything.  It was also huge, cumbersome, greasy, expensive and flavorless.  The amount of blue cheese they gave me for 50c was almost a joke, as well.  Wish I would have gotten the steamed broccoli, my \"potato salad\" was a sea of mayonnaise.  Even given my limited experience of the burger options in Pittsburgh, I would put double-wide grill's burger above these.  Not much for atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind dirty, dark and dingy if it has character.",

It definitely was, had the BBQ chicken with a side of steamed veggies, salad and bread rolls  very simple but also the best kind of meal there is. Meat and carbs done right, lots of butter, lots of potatoes and plenty of salt. The waitress didn't hold her tongue on her opinion of various dishes and upon returning, will definitely try one of these supposed world-famous burgers.",

Last time I was here, I had the Bacon Bleu Burger, with the dry crumbled blue cheese. I like my burgers cooked medium, and it was done just as I liked it. Juicy but not so greasy that it made the bread soggy. With that, I had some sauteed mushrooms, which were absolutely fantastic. Tessaro's also sells some great pork and beef ribs which I've had a time or two. Definitely among the best places to eat in the Burgh.",

It looked crowded when we arrived but we only had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated. The server did a great job of being attentive & keeping things moving without making us feel rushed. The only downside was having other tables so close on either side--tough to have a private conversation and/or not to eavesdrop. That said, it's a bar-like atmosphere, so you know going in it's not going to be a quiet dinner for two. I would definitely go back. Home fries were DELICIOUS.",

    "text": "Reviewed as one of the best burgers in Pitt and a popular spot among many CMU students, if you have a car of course. Parking is horrendous around here, so it might be better to take the bus anyways and do a bit of walking.  After hearing so much about it, my friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Did it meet all the hype? Not so sure. The burgers good, but it wasn't anything spectacular as I thought it would be. Honestly, I like Burgatory a lot better. I ordered the Bacon Bleu Cheeseburger with dry bleu cheese. Probably mistake on my part. I thought the dry bleu cheese would be more crumbly and less creamy, but the heat of the burger melted it and it became creamy anyways (I dislike creamy things in general). Didn't enjoy the burger half as much because of that, but again mistake on my part. The home fries that came with it could have used some more seasoning, but with lots of ketchup it was tasty enough.  The service was up to par. I came with a huge party and they seated us and took our orders with no problem. They even stuck a candle into my friend's burger for her birthday. Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars.",

As to the burger, you'll like it. If you manage to be disappointed in this burger, you're simply expecting too much. Its a burger for Pete's sake, not world peace! It's a piece of ground meat between two buns. If you like burgers, you'll like this one. It's good.

Had I never heard of it before, it may have gotten an extra star. But, this restaurant was on the Pittsburgh's top 25 a few years back. This is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh. If that were the case, I'd stick to making my own.  Hubs and I stopped at T's on a recent Friday night after conducting some business in the area. Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry. Overall, Tessaro's fell flat and left me hung out to dry.",

    "text": "Facts: I am not a big meat eater.  I am not a vegan, vegetarian or any combo.  I like good food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable.    All that being said, I have searching a place that serves great burgers.  I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that I order a burger.  So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro's.  I expected a dive with somewhat gruff service.  Uh, no, Tessaro's is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight.  And the service was tremendous.  Yes it was a Thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! That makes sense to me.  No use taking up a table with a partial party who is \"faffing.\" (Google term if confused)    I had a medium rare burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  The beef was good!!  This means a lot coming from me a non-meat eater.  The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.  Mr. Handsome devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction.  Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.  Will be recommending Tessaro's to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!  PS there are options for non-meat eaters:)",

The first time and every subsequent time I have been there has held up to it's legend. Don't get me wrong, there may be better burgers in Pittsburgh, but I have yet to find them.  Tessaro's has not only great burgers but also other foods that are delicious. Their menu is similar to what you would find in a steak house. They serve a lot of fish and steak aside from their burgers. After eating several different meals at Tessaro's I can say with no doubt that my favorite thing there is the \"Bacon-Bleu\" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give you the opion). The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.  The ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats.   The only downfall with Tessaro's and this is not their fault is that they are alway's almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood bar at one point it doesn't exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro's will be a great experience, espescially for those who are a fan of the old fashion hamburger and beer.",

I love my burgers, and when someone tells me they've had the best burger ever, I have to find out for myself. Tessaro's in Bloomfield is almost the best in the Burgh, but I thought it didn't quite live up to the hype.  I went for all the fix-ins with the Gourmet Burger- a 1/2 pound patty with bacon, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. I had mine medium rare with mayo, and it was big and juicy, but something missed the mark. Maybe it was the flavor of the meat or the so-so bun. Don't get me wrong- the burger was amazing, but not the best in my opinion. I had it with a side of potato salad, which was also good, but the portion size was dissappointing. Again- great food, but not the best.   Also, I was surprised by the wait- sure, they have the \"best burger in town,\" but I didn't appreciate waiting over an hour while smashed up against other patrons in the doorway. Once we were sat, we were in a tight, cramped corner and the waitress was so-so on service. The decor has a great eclectic Pittsburgh feel, which was cool, but I didn't get to enjoy it as I felt rushed by the waitress.  Over all, the food was great and Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh fixture. Go for the burger and see if it's the best you've ever had.",

If it weren't for the blue cheese and bacon it would have been borderline inedible. There didn't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever. Bland would be an understatement.   Points for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness, but I don't know how the burger here even enter any debate regarding the best burger in the 'Burgh. I'd even say Lot 17 a few doors up has more flavorful burgers - saying nothing of places like Wingharts and Burgatory.  Service is always friendly and prompt - but the food is just...OK. I think this place is just more of a Pittsburgh tradition like the similarly overrated Primanti's.",

The service was great, we were seated within a couple minutes at prime dinner time  on Friday night. Food arrived quickly and done as we asked...perfection- good bun, good blue cheese crumbles, tasty bacon and home fries. Great experience and a definite keeper on the \"go to\" list.",

    "text": "The secret in their having one of the best burgers you will ever eat, is in the meat!  They add ground steak including filet mignon!  Another reason why the burger seals in all of those juices plus adds flavor is they are cooked over a 500 degree hardwood grill.  Tessaro's was not hard to find, but in a run down area.  They have a parking lot on the side of the building, connected with a grocery store's lot..  The place is small, with a huge bar in the middle.  It was crowded, but we were lucky enough to get a booth.    I was a bit disappointed in their not having french fries, but I tend to fill up on them, so in a way it allowed me to finish that delicious huge burger!  I hear they are known for their ribs, as well. The murals are hand painted of the owners and workers and an Irishman and his sister own the restaurant and do the cooking.  The soups are homemade as well.  Servers were older and ours was friendly and helpful!  Go and have yourself one of the best burgers you will ever have in your life and add a hot homemade bowl of soup to your check, outstanding!",

It definitely was, had the BBQ chicken with a side of steamed veggies, salad and bread rolls - very simple but also the best kind of meal there is. Meat and carbs done right, lots of butter, lots of potatoes and plenty of salt. The waitress didn't hold her tongue on her opinion of various dishes and upon returning, will definitely try one of these supposed world-famous burgers.",

It also has been voted the longest wait for a table.   This place is known a lot.  When I tell  people that I am from the area, people often go \"what is that place with those huge burgers\".   As they are using their hands, and before they finish, I say Tessaro's.  Then they go \"that's it!!!\"  I am a very very picky eater.   I generally eat my sandwiches with no bun or open faced.  (it is a calorie thing with me.).   Granted the burgers are delicious.   Granted their burgers and other sandwiches do have tons of what you ordered to be on them.  Plus the bun itself is huge.  You do need two hands to enjoy your sandwich with.  I love the way they cook their burgers on the hardwood grill.  As soon as you open the door you know that you are in the right place.",

I'm sure there are people that would disagree.  Heck, I have friends who would disagree.  But I don't care, I know I'm right.    We moved to Pittsburgh from North Carolina and Tessaro's was the first place we encountered that would cook a burger to order at anything other than well done.  And I like my beef pink.  This place serves up HUGE, tasty burgers with great toppings, and very yummy home fries-style potatoes to go with them.  You could probably substitute the side, but why would you want to?  If you're hungry when you arrive and can't wait for a burger (or if you are Catholic and grace this place on a Friday during Lent), I enjoy the Seafood Chowder -- rich and creamy with chunks of seafood and just the right combination of seasonings.    I've never had anything else here, but a friend ordered the steak salad once and I was almost tempted to trade in my burger, it looked so good.",

But after having been here four times, all I can really say is that it's very meh and very Pittsburgh.  I apologize for the bland, boring, generic tone of the rest of the review, but I'm not sure how else to describe the food here...  The portion is 'American' and the burger was really thick and as juicy as I expected done medium.  As with any BIG burgers I like to cut it in half so it's manageable...and so I can still seem somewhat ladylike.  The first half of the burger was OK/good/no complaints.  The second half just seemed to lack flavor...  I guess during the first half I was just hungry, but when you calm down and taste the order, it was so bland.  I mean of course I could taste the mayo/ketchup/mustard, but the actual meat part was just flavorless.  I was really disappointed by that...  I ordered potato salad as my side and it was good/OK too...nothing to call home about.  In all honesty I would've rather had Five Guys or In-n-Out burgers.",

After seeing 4 waitresses standing and chatting for a few minutes, who could see us waiting in clear view, we  prompted a nearby waitress, she told us it wasn't her section and said they were in the middle of a shift change.  A waitress came over served us, was pleasant, but didn't come over to check our food was OK.  When my husband waited for a soda refill after several waitresses passing by, my husband got up to go to the bar to ask for another drink.  At that point a waitress offered him a refill. If it wasn't for the food being great, I would give 2 stars.  Very disappointing.",

They do have a special lunch menu and as I was pursuing a cheesesteak sandwich my waitress came and told me they were best known for their hamburgers.  She told me that they have butcher who comes in daily and grinds fresh meat for the burgers. The staff then fire the meat on a wood burned grill. I saw that each burger was 1/2 pound and felt that would be too much to eat. She told me I could order the kid's portion for $1.00 less and would get 1/4 pound. It would come with the same sides they offer. Basic additions such as lettuce tomato, onion, and mustard come at no additional charge but if you want to prepare your burger to represent one of the ones on the menu then there is a slight upcharge.  I was in a room surrounded by pretty artwork and overlooking an outdoor eating area for better and warmer days. I had my food in no time at the sound of the \"bell\" which alerts the waitress  that the food is prepared. I ordered mine medium well and it came out as such. She brought me ketchup and the attended to my needs. I had cole slaw as my side. The burger was very good and very messy so I'm glad I ordered extra napkins.   I got to chatting with folks at the next table. The lady there told me this restaurant gets their bread from the Allegro Hearth bakery in Squirrel Hill where I had previously been. Her friend ordered what they call the breakfast burger. It comes with bacon and a fried egg on top. He told me he loves the sandwich that way. He had never eaten here so I politely asked him what he thought of his sandwich. He told me it was to die for!  I did observe the larger portion and realized there would be no way I could finish it so I'm glad I had the option of ordering the smaller burger. It was just enough for me. I was in and out within the hour. They do have a full bar. Bike parking is available and around the corner is a metered lot. Next time I'm craving a burger I'll be sure to come here!",

She made the whole trip amazing and after consuming the food- I had forgotten wanting pizza at all.  A True GEM for both food and hospitality.",

BOOM.... the beef ribs were cold inside. They had obviously been precooked and then refrigerated, and were burnt on the outside. I first visited Tessaro's in the 1980's and this was definitely a low point. I didn't plan my week and wait for Thursday and visit Tessaro's to have burnt previously cooked and refrigerated then reheated beef ribs. Sorry Tessaros', you killed this relationship, I'm going elsewhere.",

They unfortunately forgot what seasoning is. The worst  let down was that they squished out all of the juices from that poor burger, leaving it hard and dry.  The only flavor left in my mouth after a few moments was of the pickle.   Pittsburghs restaurant scene is definitely on the rise, and when a place can boast, \"the best burgers in the burg\" I definitely had to try it!  I've had Burgatory's \"meat your maker\" Kobe burger, and BRGRs steak burger and even bargain burgers like hello bistros e'mp burger. This was the most forgettable burger and, at the higher price point, truly disappointing.  With so many better options out there, save your money for a place that's worth it.   Just in case you are wondering what I got, I went with the Gourmet Kelly Burger: hardwood grilled, pepper jack, bacon, grilled onions, and the typical accoutrements of lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard.",

Also a great place to go for thick cuts of steak, fish, chicken, etc. They have an in-house butcher, source the best stuff they can, and of course the wood-fire grill.  One thing to note is that they really sear the meats, so if you're ordering red meat done medium-well or more, they'll occasionally be slightly on the drier side. Most of the time they nail the char/tenderness ratio but you can't expect anywhere to get it right 100% of the time. I recommend ordering meats with a sauce on top (e.g. bbq burger, chicken sandwich w/mayo, etc) to add some moisture for the perfect combo, but that's all personal preference.   Try the ribs on Thursdays!",

I've thought about stopping by a few times not to mention by boss' eat here atleast twice a month, but for whatver reason i just never made the trip to bloomfield to try it out. We couldn't decide where to eat last night and finally decided to drive over to Bloomfield & stop in.  The building itself is old-school looking. I feel like i took a step back in time. We were originally seated upstairs near the patio and asked the hostess to actually eat on the patio last minute. It was cloudy and chilly but it was still great to sit outside.  I couldn't decide between the Barbeque Burger (& add bacon) or the Breakfast Burger. I ultimately decided on the breakfast one with home fries. I couldn't decide between those or their infamous potato salad. Our server mentioned i could do half & half, but i love home fries Bobby went with the Gourmet Steak Sandwich and went with the potato salad as a side (score) He also enjoyed a Hoegaarden while we waited. We were completely satisfied with our meal. It had to be the largest burger i've ever had. I took a picture of it as plated but should have assembled my burger for a pic to show the True size. Next time!  Our server was Briana and she was a great server! Actually, every person i ran into (I got lost on the way to the restroom) was very friendly and kind.  I dont know why it took so long to try out Tessaro's, but it will NOT be another 4 years til we go back ;)",

I hate going to places where they serve you small burgers with an eensy weensy piece of meat in the middle. No, Tessaro's gives a really satisfying sized burger. I ordered mine well done and it did seem a little overcooked. My friend ordered hers medium rare and she also said it was cooked too much. The burgers were pretty good though not the taste I was expecting. It almost tasted like one of the burgers you make at your own barbecue. It was still good, but just not my kind of burger. I ordered the potato salad as a side and it was not bad. I would prefer french fries with my order, but what can ya do?

I went with a traditional American cheeseburger, while Christian, I mean, my husband, got the Gourmet burger. Both were cooked to our specifications (medium and rare, respectively), and were juicy and flavorful. No french fries here as sides, which is an interesting decision, and makes the experience more unique. Though we could have gotten something healthy, like steamed broccoli, we both went with the home fries. They were great: tender on the inside, crispy on the outside & flavorful. Because so many of the review focused on the burgers, we were surprised to see they have lots of other menu items, including fish & ribs. So, I plan to return and give some other menu items a try. Prices are very reasonable, and I'd say easily the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh (though it's no Vortex burger!!).   And, by the way, Mr. Bale is an excellent tipper.",

    "text": "I can understand why some people give this place 5 stars and some shrug their shoulders and say nothing special.  The burgers here are ground fresh by an in house butcher and the meat is good, not greasy and very juicy. IMHO, if you added some ground chuck you would get even better flavor but overall they have some of the best tasting burger meat out there.  They cook on a griddle that is heated by burning hard woods, an interesting concept but to be honest I could not taste any smokiness to the meat. Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.  The burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.  On the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.  I like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. Service was good.  Bottom Line:  Some of the best meat that I've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck).   If you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all American hamburger with nothing fancy you will love Tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find Tessaro's lacking.  So why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood.",

The burger is definitely as good as others have said.  I believe the menu claims it's a half pounder, but it feels bigger than that to me.  It came on a delicious and soft roll and was cooked perfectly.  They don't have french fries, but I did get a side of homefries which was kinda strange to be eating with a burger.  Still, they were pretty good.  Overall the burger was really really satisfying.  Other food I saw or tried wasn't really as impressive.

Their variety of specialty burgers is large and is accompanied by other typical American fare, sch as ribs, meatloaf, and other sandwich varieties outside of the burger. While the dress is casual, the lady who is always there to greet and seat you (I would assume an owner or manager?) along with the dark wood and long bar give the space an air of elegance. While this is a great spot for a longer work lunch, I wouldn't necessarily suggest it for parties larger than 4-6. The space is small and there might be difficulty with seating for a bigger group.  Vegetarians, for the main dish you should expect grilled cheese. It is a really good, really calorie-packed sandwich and like everything else comes with a choice out of many side dishes.",

Now, I just wonder how long that burger is going to remain in my gut.  I think I can feel the bacteria burping away in there right about now... Ugh.",

I ordered a half rack of pork ribs, which  seemed at bit expensive to me at $14 until they arrived at the table. The half rack is HUGE compared to some other places where I've tried ribs. The meat was tender and falling off the bone, and their barbecue sauce (I got the mild) was quite tasty...if they sell bottles I'm going to buy one. For the side dish I got the boiled redskin potatoes, which unfortunately are literally nothing more than boiled redskin potatoes -- no salt, pepper, butter, or seasoning of any sort. I'll remember that next time.  Husband got the black and bleu burger, which he reported was good except the bun was too small. The service was fine, nothing special. The atmosphere was friendly and the place was busy but not crowded, which is a good sign in my book. The closeness of the tables to each other is a bit bothersome to me though. We could hear the conversation of the couple next to us much more than I would have liked...I felt like we were all up in their business.  We'll definitely be back.",

Although they don't take reservations (at least not this weekend, maybe because of the holiday) our party of 11 was sat together rather quickly at 8:30. Most of us got the Gourmet Cheeseburger and it was delicious! The burger was huge! It was juicy and full of flavor. I had mine topped with blue cheese, along with the onions and mushrooms. I chose to get the chips as my side and they were not homemade, something I was hoping for since all the other food was of such high quality. Our waitress was a bit scatterbrained and when she brought our food out, had no idea who got what and kept insisting the plates were right even though we each remembered what we got. Other than that, it was a great experience and I would definitly go back.",

People ask me, \"Alli, where can I get the best burger in DC?\" I tell them that they need to take 270 to Frederick, get on 70 west, get on the PA turnpike, and get off when they're near Pittsburgh.  Ask anyone how to get to Tessaro's - I'm sure they know.  Your burger will be huge, dripping, and will be so juicy that the bottom bun will be a disgusting soggy sponge.  None of that will matter, because you will be in burger heaven, delighting in the freshly ground beef that makes Tessaro's what it is.  The restaurant itself is barely more than a bar, with mean waitresses and tiny, crammed tables.  No one would probably ever go there (besides the old, crotchety regulars) were it not for the world-famous burgers.  All testament to why you must go. Now.",

    "text": "Tessaro's is one of those quaint timeless neighborhood pubs/restaurants that so many soulless national chains spend millions of dollars trying to recreate.  It's one of my favorite weekday after-work places to visit and I come here often.  The restaurant has a real hardwood grill that is is located in full view of the main dining room and baths the neighborhood with the smokey sweet smell of grilled meats that makes you salivate and your stomach ache for food.  It's one of those things that makes you feel that this place is going to be great - you cannot wait to get inside and order.  The interior always has a great vibe.  High tin-covered ceilings, old-school wood bar, exposed red brick, and denim tablecloths cover tables that are closely-spaced and nearly always full with patrons happily eating and drinking.  Arrive at a peak time, any weekday or weekend evening, and you'll likely be getting a drink at that nice bar while you wait for a table.  That's OK - the bar is fully stocked, with local Penn Pilsner on tap (along with other good beers), and service is attentive and efficient.  Don't forget to take a look at the chalkboard on the wall to see today's specials.  What to order:  You must try a burger here - I virtually guarantee that it will be one of the best you've ever had.  Tessaro's grinds their beef for their burgers fresh daily, and they rely on their own recipe for their ground beef that mixes different cuts of beef in a predetermined proportion to achieve a balance of taste and the right amount of succulent fat - both for taste and for the right amount of drippings onto that hardwood fire which flares and sears the outside of the burger with tasty good stuff.  The burger is nicely-sized, with a great selection of cheeses and toppings, and grilled to your desired level of doneness.  This is the only restaurant where I frequently order a burger without any trimmings - just so I can taste the beef in all of its smokey goodness.  A wish:  I wish they made better side dishes to accompany their burgers.  They offer some good side dishes: potato salad, steamed fresh vegetables; and some side dishes that could be better, especially the home fries, which tend to be soggy, greasy, and/or burnt.  They don't offer french fries.  I think offering a proper french fry - made with freshly-cut potatoes, first par-fried at a lower temperature and then flash-fried at a very high temperature to order would go a very long way toward perfection.  Their soups are OK, and, strangely, a good portion of their menu is listed as \"Mexican\" fare.  They don't need it, and would be better off limiting that fantastic hardwood grill to burgers, steaks, and fish specials.  If you haven't visited yet, you will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend checking it out.",

Everything else is hit or miss but the burgers are amazing, woof fire grille, filet on the inside of the ground meat and this burger is heaven.  The service can be a little shaky at times and the woman who seats you can be a litttle grumpy, but its all worth it for the burgers.  My fav is the bleu cheese burger with creamy bleu cheese.",

Luckily we didn't have to wait long and were seated soon as they could clean off a table.    I ordered the Cajun burger (medium well) with American cheese and all the fixins.  I got the potato salad as a side after reading the rave reviews about it.  While I wasn't too fond of the potato salad (I rarely am) I did enjoy the burger.  Although I was disappointed that it didn't have more of a Cajun flavor to it.  There were some bites that snapped back with spiciness but for the most part I couldn't get much Cajun flavor.  I really enjoyed the charred bites of the burger...some folks may not really appreciate this and it wasn't overwhelming, if it was I probably wouldn't have liked it.  But overall it reminded me of a great burger cooked at a BBQ!     One thing I didn't realize is all the fixins come on the side for you to put on it such as the pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayo...it worked out though since I wanted a little of each.",

    "text": "I haven't been here in ages because I only recently moved back to Pittsburgh and was looking forward to a burger, but when my service dog and I arrived, the hostess that turned out to be the owner/manager wanted to seat me in a dark, dreary, dingy inner room - and when I saw an open table next to the window in the back and asked to sit there instead, she flat out refused to seat me there.    There was no one waiting for a table, several were empty, the table was not marked reserved, and there was no one at it.  She just said \"That table is not available; this is the one I have for you\", indicating the dark, dreary one.  So of course I asked why the better one was not available, and she just said \"Because it isn't\", and repeated pointing to the dark one, repeating that that was the one she had for me.  This happened a couple of times. I asked if the other table was reserved, and she just repeated that it was not available - *for me*.  Not not available period, but clearly not available *for me*.  I then asked her if she wanted me to sit at the bad table and wouldn't give me the other one because of my dog, and she said, no, I love dogs, and told me I could take the dreary table or leave it, but she was not going to seat me at the other one, period, *or* explain why not.    But even when people love dogs, they have been known to treat people with service dogs in restaurants poorly, *very* often trying to stick us in the most undesirable locations.  I wish I had a nickel for every time this has happened both to me and other SD handlers.   An open good table for 2 (not even a bigger table) that was not reserved, with no one waiting, and she won't seat me at it *or* give me an explanation as to why not?  It was already set, so it wasn't as if there was something obviously wrong with it that it couldn't be used, either.    That, my friends, is clear evidence of discrimination against disabled people with service dogs.  Why else would she refuse to seat me there?  And it is illegal as hell to try to make us sit in undesirable locations when better ones are available, and especially when we ask for them.  Because when restaurants have reserved the table you want, there is often a placard on the table, or at the very least, they will just say so!  Why wouldn't they?  I mean, duh!  I fully understand reserved tables, and if it *had* been reserved, or if maybe people already seated at it had, say, just gone to the restroom, and no other better table had been available, I would have certainly accepted the other table. But why in hell should I accept a really dismal table otherwise??  Needless to say, I left without eating - and will not be back.    And I'd bet anything that the next solo diner or couple to go in there got the better table.   I have a lot of friends and family who eat here often; they will all be told about this, and I know that many of them will never return as a result.",

The waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly and attentive.   Getting past the atmosphere, the drinks selection is very good and the prices are very reasonable compared to a lot of city bars. It's why you'll see so many regulars hanging out at the bar.   I got the burger with bleu cheese. It was pretty good. Not phenomenal, but very good.

The staff kindly let us hold the table while we waited for everyone else. There were several first-timers at our table, and everyone said the food lived up to its glorious reputation. (Frequently perpetuated by myself) Our waitress did a wonderful job handling the various food and drink orders/customizations, and the owner/manager even came over and chatted with us. She was a sweetie. I'm a fan for life.",

    "text": "I went on a first date here Friday evening.  It's such a strange mix of upscale and casual diner - that works perfectly. I had the regular cheeseburger and it was absolutely amazing (although messy - so probably not the best first date food). My date had the steak sandwich - he said it was delicious, but it's literally a steak on a bun, so it's hard to eat gracefully (maybe cut it up first?). We had home fries as our sides - I don't even really like home fries, but these were so yummy. Great food all around.  Our food came out lightning fast. We didn't even think it was ours because it was literally five minutes after we ordered. And the service was amazing: so friendly, attentive and efficient. The hostess is the cutest little woman as well. So helpful and sweet. Not to mention, it's so affordable. I was very happy we came across this place.  My only complaint is that the dining tables in the back are very, very, very close together when they are all split into two-person tables. We were having awkward first date conversations and the couples around us may as well have been at our table. I did not enjoy that. Aside from that, I  had a great experience and I will definitely be back again.",

The staff oozes old-school Pittsburgh.  The decorations are nothing special.  The clientele ranges from high-class businessman to the stoner down the street to mom and pop out for Friday dinner.  And all those people are typically there for one thing: the burgers.  I agree with the other reviews that tout this place as having the best burgers in Pittsburgh.  The only complaint that I have is that I reek of garlic and spices for the next 2 days after eating there- the food is that intense.  Also- it isn't necessarily worth it to get one of their more specialty burgers (cheese, bacon, etc)- the meat itself should get the job done.  If you want a good microcosm of Pittsburgh and a great burger- this is your place.",

Definitely messy, but who can knock the juiciness :). I went with simple this time, next time I will get the BBQ burger with the creamy blue cheese instead of American because I could not stop eating my partners.

And while it is certainly a good burger, I expected a little more.  The feel and menu in Tessaro's is very old school.  I do like this to an extent.  This traditional style is reflective in their menu.  There are very few options in terms of burger customization.  This is an area where I think they could innovate a little.  Some onion straws or an aioli of some sort would make the burgers here even better.  The burger itself has been cooked perfectly both times I have been here.  The burgers taste seems to have a higher lean ratio than other burger places.  Despite this, the freshness and unique meat blend still makes for a delicious taste.  Overall, Tessaro's without a doubt has a great burger.  However I cannot put it on par with the best burgers in the city.",

Will most definitely be back, clearly.",

HOW COULD I FORGET - the root beer tasted like the root beer you used to drink with your grandpa while he was drinking his beer, aka perfection!",

I think that the reason I'm withholding a fifth star is a little bit because of expectations; the Pittsburgh city mag has this on their top 50 restaurants and that brought me here, and I got done with my meal and said to myself...really?  I mean good and all that but one of the best in Pittsburgh?  Not sure.  I'd go back but I'd also keep exploring.  Maybe if they had had fries...hard to really fall in love with a burger without some fries on the side...a bar burger is crying for fries on the side!",

So whenever Lent ended, I had one thought on my mind, and that thought was a Gourmet Burger cooked at a delightful medium-rare from Tessaro's.  Not having meat for forty days and then having a Tessaro's Gourmet Burger is like dying and going to a meaty paradise, where one can eat burgers all day and all night and never ever feel full.  My first bite into my burger led me to consuming the whole burger in no less than 2 or 3 minutes. I couldn't help myself, I kept eating and eating and eating as fast as I could, because my body was deprived of meaty protein for so long.  The Gourmet Burger came with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and my choice of provolone cheese. You also have the choice of yellow mustard, dijon mustard, or spicy brown mustard. I went with Yellow mustard, and mayonnaise, of course. I lathered the bun up perfectly with mayo and mustard and licked my fingers after my burger disappeared into my belly.Their potato salad and cole slaw are top-notch as well, and go amazingly with your burger.  Tessaro's burgers are AMAZING. No doubt about it, the best burger I have ever had in my life is the Gourmet Burger from Tessaro's.",

It was so good to be back home for a few days, on business and visiting family a couple of weeks ago. After a bad night at a trendy place in the Strip, we headed to Tessaro's the next night  for great food, cozy atmosphere and the very heart of Pittsburgh.  My parents, my teenage sons and my husband and I happily squeezed into a booth together.  If you are a first time or occasional visitor to Pgh and want a sure bet on a good meal, and local atmosphere, this is your place.    I think my brother is right - this is a place that has only gotten better over the years.  Blowing you a kiss, Tessaro's.  Thanks for not changing!   See you again soon (especially if our 16 year old decides he loves Pitt!)",

I went with the bacon and bleu cheese burger.  I ordred it medium, and it was a bit overcooked, but I can't complain.  It was one of the best burger's I've ever eaten.

The wait staff was extremely friendly, as well!  Now for the burger:  It was absolutely huge!  When I bit into it I tasted the smokiness of the grill and it was nice and juicy.  The toppings, though, were your standard lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.  I would have loved to have this burger and the Burgatory toppings!  My 16 year old son finished his burger in no time flat, along with his hashbrowns, that he loved.  My father could not finish the burger, nor his coleslaw side.  I got a nice healthy side of steamed cauliflower and broccoli (like it mattered at this point), and was able to eat 3/4 of the burger and all my veggies!!

I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.  The ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \"medium rare\" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.  Though shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.

The burger definitely has that wood grill flavor.  Ordered a medium burger, it was cooked a tad to long and not as juicy as I would expect.   If you like BBQ or wood flavored meat, this is a good option.  The home fries were lacking any real flavor, needing salt and pepper, and could have used some onions or peppers when cooked.    We sat at the bar and the Bartender was on top of everything, including seating people at times.",

Large portions and a variety on the menu I could hardly decide what I wanted because everything looked so good!

The place is small with a large bar, dimly lit, you can watch the cooks make your food through a large window at the back of the dining room.  We couldn't get past the burger menu. There are other things on the menu but we came for burgers.  I has the blue cheese/bacon burger and it was fantastic.  The home fries were so good but they contain bacon in case your a vegetarian and don't expect it.  They are great.  My husband had a cheddar burger and it too was great.  Full bar service.

Let's get the positive out of the way first: The burgers are pretty big and fairly tasty, so if you want a big burger maybe this is your place.  Everything else was just not very appetizing. I got a bowl of chili that was essentially a large tub of thick marinara sauce. No flavor, couldn't even taste the meat, and only a few small kidney beans. I also got a veggie kabob, which was a plate full of uncooked zucchini, mushrooms, etc., also with no flavor. Some of them were so undercooked they were room temperature.  Maybe the moral of this story is don't go to a burger joint and get two dishes that don't feature meat!  On the plus side, they give you free refills on soda, so my teenage cousins enjoyed far too many glasses of Mountain Dew.",

    "text": "For the past few years, I've been trying to find the best burger in Pittsburgh... and I really don't understand why I didn't check this place out sooner. Tessoros is easily in the top 3 best burgers I've had in the 'bugh, and it's easy to say why. Their burgers are moist and juicy but still holds its shape and has a nice crust. There are no frills here, no pretentious octopus burger or other nonsense. The simple array of toppings really brightens the burger and lets it shine. They have a nice selection of sides that come with the burger, though no fries! The place has a charming ma' and pa' quality to it as well. The only negative I can say about the burger is that the buns were on the lower end of the equality spectrum. If they had better buns, this place would be a clear #1. I plan to come back here many times in the future.",

    "text": "Tessaro's is getting a subsidy from the butter industry, I'm pretty certain. Everything they serve comes with a glistening sheen of butter, which makes everything delicious and rich, and makes for a bit of heartburn later. Not the worst thing ever.  They make an extremely good steak, perfectly cooked. Their ingredients are excellent. Admittedly I tend to be there just about closing time, but I always get the impression that they can't decide if they are a fine dining establishment or a sports bar where the waitstaff would rather go home than deal with me.   Their steak salad with home fries and grilled onions means the potatoes, onions and sliced steak are on top of the salad. With butter. So all these delicious components don't quite work as a protein on a salad. I know Pittsburgh is famous for potatoes on sandwiches, but it's just an odd layer to work though.  Their steak sandwich and open faced steak sandwich are exactly what it says: a steak sitting on top of a slice of bread. Absolutely delicious, but not something I would pick up with my hands and eat.   Having said all that, the food is well made and they close late. The servers are nice enough without being solicitous, and they haven't turned me away yet.",

Our server was great - especially since she had a whole room to herself.  I ordered 1/2 bbq chicken with the home fries and my boyfriend got the gourmet steak sandwich. I was really happy with my chicken - it was tender, moist, and the breakfast potatoes were really good. The sauce was okay - there could've been more but I didn't want to bother the server since she was swamped.  My boyfriends steak sandwich was average. He liked the amount of beef on the sandwich but was disappointed with the texture. He said that it was a little tough for his liking.  Overall, a decent experience and I would return if someone else wanted to go. But it's not a place that I'll be dying to go back to.",

The waitress was really nice and moved as fast as she could, But unfortunately the place was mobbed and there were only 2 on duty and she was probably doing twice the normal amount of tables. It was also rib special night so they were very apologetic and said they were short staffed and that it was crazy busy besides. I would definitely go there again just not on rib night. I would also recommend Tessera's as the food was delicious.",

Plus they always tend to be upbeat, which i absolutely love.  I would like to say that I have tried all but the Kelly burger (I have an aversion to things with onions and mushrooms). The burgers are always cooked just perfectly (medium, which makes me extremely happy). But my favorite burger would honestly have to be the bacon and bleu. Literally all my favorite things put together. Definitely can't go wrong! The salads are really good to! I can honestly say these people are #1 on my list when it comes to burgers!",

To start with the decor all I can say is it feels like home. Exposed brick. Crammed in tables. Murals on the walls. Antique lighting. Lots of family mementos. I love each and every piece of it.   As far as the service goes I don't think they have hired a large portion of new staff since... ever. And that's ok with me. I love long time servers and bartenders who know everyone and treat you like family. When they get busy it may get a little slow but the service is always so pleasant I don't care.   Tessaro's does gave a full bar but don't go expecting new age hipster inspired mixology. It's definitely a simple bar from a simple time. Drink your manhattans, vodka martinis, wine and draft beer and be happy.   The big claim to Tessaro's fame is their burger. The burgers are fresh ground juicy and delicious. Also the Tuesday ribs are killer. It all comes down to the wood grill. It makes the whole neighborhood smell heavenly.   To finish up Tessaro's is a perfect example of old school. Everything about them just reeks of tradition. With all the new gourmet burger joints popping up around Pittsburgh it warms my salty red neat engorged heart to see that the original isn't just alive and kicking, but thriving.",

We didn't have to wait long for a table, and the service was fine. I do like the atmosphere, but I just had so many better burgers that I just can't rave about this place.

    "text": "After hearing about how great their burgers are by word of mouth from a few different people, my girl and I happened to be in the Bloomfield area and decided to check the place out. First off, its very old school vibe. I kinda felt like this bar should have been in a scene from the Deer Hunter movie. Dark paneling on the walls, dark ceiling, very low lighting, waiters and waitress's wearing white aprons, that sort of feeling. A nice lil old lady waited on us. We went about dinner time, though there was a snow storm that afternoon the place was pretty much empty so we were served quickly.  Of course we both ordered different burgers with home fries. The burgers were of a nice portion. I got the Cajun burger with some greasy home fries. It was good but honestly, why I gave it a 3 stars was that there is really nothing spectacular about the burger or place in my opinion. It was good but not great. I don't think I'd drive from miles around to quench my burger needs here. I can see this place being a nice lil place to visit from time to time if you live in the neighborhood though. I definitely would go and check the place out if you've never been there before just to say you where there.  Happy eatings my fellow Yelpers! Your's Truely, The Shaw...",

We stood in the corner very close to another table, and waited for about twenty minutes before being seated.  Even when we were seated, the four of us got a tiny two-person table... and people kept coming in, crowding the entrance area without proper sitting or waiting room.  Food was good -- it's keeping me from giving this place two stars.  I got the cheeseburger with medium rare meat and home fries.  The burger was aiight, I think I've had better.  It was good and had a wooden-smoke flavor to it, but I thought the meat was too oily.    Homefries on the other hand: so good. These also had buttery and wooden flavors and I loved it.",

Despite the wood grill, burgers don't arrive at the table with that \"maillard reaction\" browned exterior or with enough seasoning to make them as flavorful as they should be.  Tessaros could be a 5 star burger heaven if their grill line cooks had a solid lesson on meat flavoring and on how to get the right exterior char.  Still - it's a favorite of mine as long as you go in with not too high expectations.",

Broccoli and cauliflower and grilled onions and mushrooms. All topped with a steak or chicken. I usually go for a med rare steak.   You can get a small or large. My only complaint was that the veggies were too oily. I'll have to make sure to ask for steamed veggies with no oil.   Other than that my wife had the exact same meal.   Service is always good and friendly. And the new deck is going to be my regular spot!!",

For dinner both myself and my dining companion decided on the  bacon-bleu burger.  I ordered my burger medium and it came to me at medium rare but still tasted pretty good.  It was also nice to have the option of wet or dry blue cheese.  For sides I had the cole slaw and my dining companion had the home fires. Neither was terribly inspiring although not too bad either.  The bottom line for me that this is a decent place for a burger although it is far from the best burger in Pittsburgh as many claim.  I am sure that I will be back in the future as their wait staff is always good and the food worth the price.",

    "text": "Questions & Answers  Q) How does one fully cook a 3/4\" thick burger medium well in 3 minutes?  A) Maybe pre-cook them and then microwave them when ordered.   Q) Why do buns fall apart and appear hard and cold?  A) They are old and have been kept either frozen on in a cold box to save money.   Q) Why does a slice of cheese not melt on a burger and appear rubbery?  A) Maybe the burgers were microwaved and then a cold slice of cheese was slapped on. If you microwave the burger with the cheese on it will be completely ruined so better to apply after the re-heat.   Q) What does it mean when your tomato slice is mushy and soft?  A) Usually indicates old tomato close to rotting.   Q) When home fries are greasy and burnt, what would that indicate?  A) Usually a sign that they were leftover from an earlier service or day and over cooked.   I only ate a single small piece of potato and asked the server to take it all back and remove from my bill.   The manager removed the charge for my wife's burger and charged me only half for mine so technically I ended up paying $.50 for a burger I didn't touch and a single piece of greasy potato.   Q) Was this a bad night for a good place or is in indicative of a older restaurant trying to compete with all the new and excellent places in an up and coming area by cutting costs via inferior ingredients.   A) Only time will tell!",

    "text": "I've heard this restaurant in Bloomfield's \"Little Italy\" served up some pretty good burgers so I went and tried for my self. And... they're pretty good!   Smells great inside. On a Saturday afternoon, I could tell it probably attracts an older crowd during all business hours. It's somewhere I'd come with a date or family, not to have a couple drinks. It's appropriately in Little Italy. I got take out so I can't comment on the service.   Gourmet Kelly burger- 4.1/5 Boy, was this thing BIG. Probably half a pound of meat sits on a large bun with sauteed onions, mushroom, bacon, lettuce, pickles, and tomato, with dijon mustard and mayo, if you want it.   What do I look for in a burger? Its a pretty simple concept: the meat needs to not fall apart, bit be dry, and have a ton of flavor. How did this check out?   My medium rare temperature order came out more medium in color, but the burger was super juicy; and while the burger sort of disassembled while I ate, the meat stayed in tact. What this burger lacked was the flavor. All you need is some salt and pepper but I really could not tell if they put any on or not! Luckily, it was saved by a lot of complimentary flavors of the bacon, onion and mushroom, but I wish the meat had more of a stand-alone punch. They pride themselves on the \"hardwood grill\", but I missed those tones.   Home fries- 4.3/5 These were really solid. I like mine with more of a crispy the outside, but I enjoyed the flavors.   Final thoughts:  The burger was good enough for me to come back and try one of their other ones! Maybe I'll add more of my own salt and pepper to the patty this time.",

We came for lunch on a recent Saturday, the front bar area was busy so we sat in a back room which was about half full - not as atmospheric as the front but perfectly pleasant. Our waitress was very friendly, as was another lady who I assumed was the owner/manageress.  Burgers were great, they arrived promptly and were perfectly cooked, generously sized, and very tasty. There's no fries at Tessaro's but there are plenty of other side options which are included in the price of your burger. We had a potato salad and some home fries both of which were good. Drinks wise there is a good selection of beers on tap and bottled craft beers. Prices are very reasonable indeed.  Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh classic for good reason and I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I'd always wanted to check out Pitts-Town. Since trek ain't like a walk in a park, I needed a reason to be headed in that direction to make the pilgrimage. Place is cool. So many places you can hang out. It was full no doubt. Bar seating area. Sun room seating. Other side of the bar seating, well you get the point. You can spot the place from a mile away. Beautiful red brick lay out. So spotting wasn't an issue. Unless you're visually challenged. It is the bloody parking that is the major issue. Finding a spot was a major PITA! Luckily yours truly found one. Oh' and better polish up your parallel parking skillZ otherwise you're SOL! Ok, so now I totally made you wanna spring for this place and the town, let me tell you about the food.   Menu is good! Your typical American stuff! If you cannot find what you like on this gritty town's restaurant menu, you probably don't have a pulse. I'm a huge BURGER fan! I'll take a bacon cheeseburger over penne vodka sauce any day of the week!  Wait staff is attentive. Food is good! I went for Bacon / Blu Cheese (dry). None of that chicken wing sauce type bullshit for me. Gimme the good stuff! Lots of toppings / condiments choices. I had to ask the waitress twice. Thats because my head was stuck up my ass trying to figure out which burger to order. My fault totally. Poor waitress. But no worries, I made it up the end. Anywho- Check out the pictures for your viewing pleasure. So, if you happen to stroll through, come stop at this place. Make sure you pick a warm day, because 1) walking in cold bloody sucks. (Because of the parking situation.) And 2) pay attention while you're walking. You'll need to. You don't want to step into anything organic left by our beloved four legged companions.   Ok, if I have not reached out to you and wished you a Merry New Year, no worries we still cool! I'm just lazy!   Peace,",

This used to be my favorite spot when I lived in Bloomfield years ago. I remembered they had a great chicken sandwich and ordered that with fries. My husband had the cheesesteak that he really enjoyed. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the sandwich since the chicken was very dry. The food came out quickly so not sure if it was being kept warm since it is a popular place. It could just be that it was a busy weekend, so I will go again. I will try something else next time. I did not tell the waitstaff that may have rectified the issue since my husband would be done and we would have to wait. Will come back and I am sure it will be 4 or 5 stars next time!",

The bar was full of regulars who were extremely friendly, and everyone seemed to be saying the same thing, that this is the best place around. I had the Kelly burger and it was outstanding. At first glance I was disappointed in the concept of no french fries, but the potato salad was spot on, so I didnt even notice. Tessaro's is a must try for anyone in Pittsburgh.",

The burger itself was under-salted and over-cooked (no places in PGH seem to understand what medium looks like...) and came on a bun that looked fresh out of a $1 pack from the grocery store. The cheese was similarly uninspiring and the side of chips I'm 100% sure DID come out of a bag of wavy Lays.   Bottom line: The average person could make a much better burger at home without really trying, and it would also cost less.",

My girlfriend suffered copious \"meal envy\" when our spiky haired 21-year Tessaro's veteran waitress handed me an overflowing plate of charred (in a good way) chicken & huge chunks of red & yellow pepper, onion, zucchini, yellow squash, & mushroom. The only flavoring was the grill - no sauce or spices - which at first came off as bland but soon became enjoyable as my normally over-salted palate adjusted to the simple delights of unadorned food.  GF had a cheeseburger & boiled potatoes and she enjoyed it a lot. Their boiled red skin potatoes are another simple treat reminiscent of my Mom's Sunday dinners culled from her Germanic roots that often included new potatoes with vinegar, onions, and butter. Truly delightful!   Our waitress was really a gem - old school dame with some sass and a family tale of a sister-in-law with black & silver locks that turned heads. She made no fuss and profusely mea culped when we pointed out an extra drink on our receipt.  We ventured into the Ladies Room before leaving and found it to be clean and well maintained; adorned with antique mirrors.  Tessaro's is a longtime neighborhood meeting place that has survived on good service and two-fisted burgers.",

Burgers are adequate - nothing special. Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better.   Years ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now, forget it. Burgers are ubiquitous and great ones are everywhere. Best burger in the city is at Kaya - the Kaya burger. Tessaro's - a fading icon of days gone by.  Enjoy the crowds, convince yourself your getting the best, that you're in the know. You're  not.",

What I am a fan of is a place that can actually cook your meat to the requested temperature. By golly, Tessaro's never fails. I ask for a rare steak on the spinach salad, rare it is. Ask for a medium rare burger, done! I overheard a lady praising the kitchen on her well done steak, is that even possible?  I've eaten here MANY times, not that difficult since I've lived in the neighborhood over a decade, and I've heard just about every conversation you could expect. What I've never heard is anyone complaining about the meat temp.   That is amazing.   So is the potato salad, though I wish it had egg chunks in it.",

They do not take reservations and it often gets quite busy so be prepared to grab a drink at the bar ( seats turnover pretty quickly). They have a decent selection of drafts including a number of local brews. The menu has many other options besides burgers including salads and ribs. I always stick with a burger and my favorite is the blue cheese and bacon. You have your choice of creamy or crumbled blue cheese and lettuce, tomatoe, onion and pickle. I got the works which has that home cooked taste! You also have many sides to choose from including veggies, home fries, rice or potato salad. I highly recommend the potato salad!

Maybe we came in late on a quiet night, although many of the tables were still occupied with a few at the bar counter.

It was less juicy than some others I've tried, and the outside of the patty might have been a bit too burnt for my taste, but overall it was a good meal. The size was just right, and the price at less than $10 can't be beat, since it comes with a side as well. I think some other places have burgers that are fancier or juicier (Fatneads, Wingharts, and Butterjoint come to mind), but this is definitely the place for an inexpensive and simple option.",

It's a place that's (apparently) been around forever and just has a cool, old school vibe to it. The decor is totally out of date, just like the uniforms the servers wear. Who thinks that the white button down shirt with the little black tie works in 2012? The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.  If you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.  I chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.  The cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.  Tessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Bottom line,  Tessaro's is a solid choice if you're in the mood for meat and you want to minimize your chance of running into Bloomfield hipsters.",

My girlfriend and I went on a date she claimed when she went that their burgers were delicious and I've seen them on tv so I wanted to try it myself. Whenever we were seated we waited for 15 minutes before we got acknowledged we only ordered coffee and water for the both of us, whenever I put my cream in my coffee It curdled and ruined the fact that I wanted coffee. My girlfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and I had ordered a bacon burger and we were going to cut down the middle to have a half of each it took 20 minutes after the coffee incident for her to come back to take our order. Another 45 minutes to get our food and once the food came out my burger didn't have a bottom bun nor BACON!!!! My girlfriends sandwich was beyond dry and wasn't the actual chicken sandwich she ordered. Overall after reading reviews and seeing them in tv and experiencing it myself I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT. Such a disappointment",

Food(8.5/10) = ordered the breakfast burger, which involves half a pound of beef, an egg, and strips of bacon.  Think about that.  A chicken, a cow, and a pig in between bread.  A new holy trinity?  Lovely indeed.  The burger was definitely juicy, and the egg yolk added a velvety texture.  You have a choice of sides, and opted for the standard home fries.  Paired with beer...you've got an American meal.  Ambiance (8.0/10) = definitely a neighborhood joint.  Seemed like a lot of the customers were regulars.  Couple of TVs at the bar for sports.    Service (8.5/10) = can't remember the name of our bartender/waitress, but very sweet lady.    Overall opinion = I've heard that this place has received awards for best burger in Pgh.  Not sure if I can share that opinion yet since I'm new to the city, however, there is no question that this place serves high quality classic juicy burgers.  If you want a no-BS burger, take a trip to Tessaro's.",

    "text": "Went for a second time on a busy Friday night and had a 45 minute wait for a table.    The wait was not unexpected, so we expected to order drinks and pass the time.  However, the bar tenders were very unenthusiastic about serving drinks to us.  The two bar tenders made us feel like we were putting them out.  While waiting, we were told to stand in the rear coat rack area.  There are about ten wooden posts for coats and above those posts is a rail with an inch thick line of dust.  The dust doesn't end there.  We were sat at a booth at the front of the place under a ceiling fan and under an old phone.  The phone above us on the wall is covered in cobwebs and dust.  Each of the ceiling fan blades is covered in dust and that dust and dirt is so thick it is dripping off the sides just waiting to fall in our plates.    The food:  average.   Most of us had burgers.  One of us had the open face steak sandwich.  The steak was over charred and under seasoned.  One of us felt the same about one of the burgers.  6 of us plus drinks was $160.00.   This place needs to be closed for a few days of deep cleaning.  If they don't care about the cleanliness of the dining room, they surely don't care about safe food prep.",

    "text": "I'm assuming something has changed with Tessaro's. These burgers came so highly recommended that I immediately came here very excited when I had a burger craving. After my experience, I really don't understand what all the hype is about.  The atmosphere is potentially claustrophobic if you're seated in certain areas. There's very little space between some tables (near Liberty/the entrance) and it's a very loud place, so be prepared to listen to everyone else's conversations. I'm aware that it's not by any means a romantic spot, but yelling over the people next to you isn't ideal no matter what. If you've been to Nicky's Thai Kitchen downtown and been against the wall, the tables are even closer than that.  The wait for someone to take our drink order was rather long. The wait to get our drinks (two draft beers) was also unreasonably long. When it comes to food, I don't really mind if food takes a little longer because it's freshly prepared (as they claim on their menu). However, when we finally got our burgers, they were okay. I'd say adequate. Nothing like what was hyped to me at all, and I'm told that it's just not the same as it used to be. The home fries are a nice touch, but not incredible either.  One thing I'll commend: burgers were cooked pretty much perfectly. I ordered my burger cooked medium, my girlfriend ordered medium rare, and it was dead on. I'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least.  Over all, I might try Tessaro's again on the chance that this was just an off night, but I might aim for takeout instead and see how that goes.",

It's a good size patty, maybe 1/3 of a pound, with a signature blend of meat cuts that amounts to a juicy, flavorful burger.    Many places ask you how you'd like your burger cooked, and then no matter what you say it ends up medium or well-done. I've started ordering burgers rare just to ensure *some* pinkness to the meat. At Tessaro's, if you order your burger medium-rare, that's how you get it.  The no-frills cheeseburger is delicious, but I'd also recommend the Bacon Bleu Burger.  All the sides are good. The potato salad is a fine example of the form. The servers are unfailingly up beat and the dining areas are cozy and warm (one room has a fireplace that's always going during the winter).  This place isn't getting a Michelin star any time soon, but this is a quintessential traditional neighborhood casual dining establishment and won't let you down.",

I chose one of their specialty burgers (creamy blue cheese + bacon), but sadly, they screwed up my order giving me just a plain ol' burger instead much rarer than I cared for and they forgot my chips. By then, I was too hungry to care or make a fuss, so I just ate it and it was still delicious! Hypoglycemia does strange things to the mind.

If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \"meat,\" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \"amazing.\"  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades.",

    "text": "Kudos to Tessaro's for cooking my burger the way I ordered it.  Most places won't give you a \"medium\" burger; it usually leans toward medium well, at best.  Tessaro's took a liberal approach to medium and it fared more toward medium-rare to my surprise and delight.  So for that, hooray!  And it definitely was the plumpest, juiciest burger I've had in a looonnngg time.   That said, I really wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be.  I thought I liked my burgers pure and untainted, but here I found myself wanting a little more flavor.  I guess it just tasted a little bland.  The homefries, also a little bland.   I don't know...maybe my expectations were too high.  Despite being underwhelmed by the food (by no means dissapointed), I loved the atmosphere.  It was cozy and bustling and unpretentious, and the service was spot-on.  Once seated, we didn't have to wait for a thing.  Our orders were taken immediately, our drinks arrived at our table within a minute of ordering, and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.   Good to know: They won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  In this case, it was just my husband I was waiting on.  That was a little annoying...but understandable considering how busy they are.  Definitely a solid burger worth the praise and the totally reasonable price!  I probably won't go out of my way to go back, but I'd definitely take an out-of-town visitor for a meal there and it's a definite stop if I'm in or near the neighborhood.",

The atmosphere in Tessaro's is like that of a thousand bars I've been to, but the burger served here is better than just about anything served at more upscale places.  My burger (ordered rare) was served right around medium well, which would typically ruin it.  Somehow, it worked.  Whatever blend these guys use (we could see them grinding it right behind the window adjacent to our booth) is exceptionally good - it tasted great, overcooking and all.  The exterior had a great sear from the grill, the inside wasn't dried out at all, and it had a perfect bun-to-beef ratio.  If anything, the bacon and cheese were superfluous; this burger was good enough to stand on its own.  I ordered a 50/50 split of potato salad and home fries, each of which was superior to most fries served at burger joints (no fries served here).  Good complement to the burger.  To top off the Tessaro's experience, the four of us wandered out into daylight and realized we were covered with a light dusting of soot, evidently from the wood-fired grill we'd been sitting next to.  Ordinarily, that'd be disgusting.  After that great burger, I'll call it a unique stamp of authenticity.",

This girl grills meat outdoors in sub zero weather.   I orders the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and potato salad (no fryer, hence, no fries) LFOJ orders the same, exceptin' she gets the home fries.  I orders an iPA since I find that's the best tasting beer for wood fired grilled meat. LFOJ orders a bottle of Coors light  Our burgers are brought out and when it was put in front of me, the smell was truly a religious experience. Like a hundred and forty three angels were singing the Ava Maria.  My burger was grilled a perfect medium rare, LFOJ ordered her burger medium, the first bite was an incredible burst of grilled beef flavor, so much so, the bacon was completely overpowered. This was a burger that deserved national attention. Okay potato salad, nothing spectacular, but it was only a side, the burger was the star of this meal!",

    "text": "What a wonderful place to have a burger! From the ambiance, to the friendly staff, to the monstrous half pound burgers made from ground sirloin on site; Tessaro's really has it going on.   Now I've only ate the burgers here so I can't comment on any of the other food, but without a doubt the burgers are what Tessaro's is known for. The BBQ burger is my favorite, but all of their selections are outstanding. The toasted bun and great super fresh toppings really top it off.   Keep in mind these things are huge. For 8 dollars you will be absolutely stuffed. Pittsburgh really has it great, a burger like this in San Francisco would cost close to 15 dollars.   I must also mention the bar. Great selection of beers and they even support local East End Brewery with two of their wonderful selections on tap.   The setting is a real old school type of vibe. It almost feels like stepping foot in a time machine and going back to the Bloomfield of the 1950's. Wonderful lighting and a great place for a date or a night out with friends. Every time I stop back in Pittsburgh I grab a burger here!",

    "text": "Top contender for best burger in the 'Burgh. I understand there are a lot of new boutique burger joints popping up in and around the Steel City, but remember before Burgatory, Wingharts, BRGR, etc there was a lone champion (save maybe Piper's) in the category of best burger and that belonged to Tessaro's.  As a former resident of the small friendly neighborhood of Friendship I visited Tessaro's many times and always wondered why I ever ate a burger outside my own house anywhere else.  They are fantastic, the meat  mixture is juicy, fresh, and has tons of good beef flavor.  The buns are warm and don't mess with the top billing.  The toppings compliment, but never overpower and the side of home fries is perfect in a sublime sort of way.  By far my favorite combo for a Tessaro's burger is one with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, provolone, and mayo.  Cliches be damned this is a God send for a mouth.  Smack that sucker on a plate next to grilled home fries and pour me an imperial ale because it's go time.  If you're new to the Burgh or new to the boutique burger scene do yourself a favor and get over to Bloomfield for the reigning champ, Tessaro's.",

While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated.  When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd!  We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up.    I would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away.",

She questioned how I ordered my burger (I don't care what temp I ordered it at, I didn't ask for raw), and then she offered to have them cook my burger more. I pointed to my plate which at this point consisted of ground meat mush, laughed a little, and said \"that might be hard since it fell apart\"... her response... wait for it... \"we can take it back and re-patty it for you and then cook it more\"... RE-PATTY?!? I passed on the idea of them taking food that I had already started eating back to the kitchen and putting it back on the grill.

The burgers are huge, no doubt about that. No matter how I order it, I receive a burnt and charred burger that tastes of the grill. I tried a steak instead thr next time we went. Even worse, no seasoning whatsoever.   It's close to where I live and work so I stop in from time to time if everything else is closed. The newly remolded area is nice and quiet so that's a plus.  Would I recommend it? Probably not. Will I return? Inevitably.",

I really like the potatoes instead of fries to change up the commons burger and fry pairing.

    "text": "The Godburger has been stewing over his 3rd loss in a row from 3 years back. It still wanted a piece of me.   It taunted me via online forums, calling me \"The Workin' Stiff,\" threatening to get me \"bound up for a week\" due to its prodigious size.   \"I wanna try you one more time,\" it said. \"Come back, kid. I need to show you why I'm still on top, why I still kill Flathead's, Glurgatory, and Wingfart's. They ain't a drop of burger juice to me. Bring yer old lady too. I want her to see me beat you. Then, I'm gonna run off wit her!\"   Last night, after a bastard of a week, I decided to take out my frustrations on The Godburger once more, ignoring Kay's pleas.  \"Baby, you don't need to do this again.\"  So for the 4th time, I met The Godburger. Instead of running at me like a bull, on this occasion, it tried to psych me out with theme music, casually strolling out of the chamber and onto the darkened chessboard floor as the crowd jeered it...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Di-6jntlAWJs&s=5ceb8cf3af434819128c53b4de232d4f8e98dae01787ca812d210f0e29786295\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=i-6j...</a>  Steaming, it spat a mixture of jus and blood in my face, causing me to lose control and attack, but with first bite, I was covered with....egg yolk?  \"Ha-ha! Breakfast boy-yo!\"  Spinning out of hand quickly, I discovered that jack cheese, a sunny side up egg, and bacon were added to its arsenal. I also learned that beef doesn't always need seasoning to be tasty, the natural flavors of the chopped chuck (still done on the premises) shining through with no embellishment needed to draw them out.   Before long, all that was left of the colossus were stains of hot, yellow liquid and pieces of that chewy sourdough bun that is prepared fresh every morn by a neighboring bakery.   The sweet cream of the tender potato salad acted as a quiet epilogue, and like the burger, it sits at the highest echelon.   I needed to go back in the wake of the recent lynching of Tessaro's (anti-'Burgh bias, hatred of the venerable and traditional?), and after my latest experience, have chosen to deem those petty, negative reviews clueless and irrelevant. Tessaro's doesn't need to be hip or rely on gimmickry. They just do what they do, and they do it smashingly well.   Also, for the very first time, I tried an entree from Tessaro's expansive menu that was not a burger, their Barbeque Chicken being a tender, moist, sticky, honeybun of a clucker that thankfully for me, Kay couldn't finish.   I've beaten the Godburger in enough matches to know once and for all that it is as supreme as it has ever been. Now, to explore the remainder of the menu when next I eat there.  P.S. The service was just fine.",

The decor is rustic with plenty of wood booths and denim tablecloths. The staff is also very friendly and seems like they have been here as long as I have been coming here. The most amazing thing about this place is the kitchen. It us a tiny, and I mean tiny, open kitchen just behind the bar area. How they get such tremendous flavors from this kitchen is amazing but I can't complain. Also for as busy as they get, especially on weekends, they still get food out pretty quickly.   I highly recommend coming here to anyone who enjoys a good burger.",

The Deli Burger was good, but I was definitely jealous of that amazing looking Breakfast Burger.  As I've matured, I've gotten over the fact that they do not offer fries as a side and appreciate the potato salad, cole slaw or home fries.  I've never had a bad burger  (though sometimes they can be overcooked when I order medium) or experience here (service has always been top notch).  I respect that they continue to do what has always made them successful and hope that they can keep up with all the burger competition.",

This is not the kind of place you come for a million toppings.  This is a straight up, non-fancy, large burger.  It's not trendy, and it probably never will be.  Otherwise, I came here and personally ordered a whiskey sour and a cheesesteak with coleslaw.  The whiskey sour was spot on, and the alcohol content was spot on as well.  The cheesesteak was great, not particularly traditional, but great nonetheless.  The steak was tender and there was plenty of it.  Lots of cheese.  No complaints!  My parents' meals were great too!  If you need some meat and friendly service in your life, Tessaro's is a great place to stop.",

It also has great grilled flavor. However, it kind of tastes like something you can grill at home. The seven burgers they offer on their menu are also quite simple with average toppings, making these burgers more like your cookout burger made at home. So they taste pretty good, nothing too special aside from the fact that they're really big. My gripe with the size of the burger is that it is so large, it completely smashes the bottom bun thinner than a pancake. By the time the burger gets to you, your bottom bun has basically vanished into a soggy layer of mush. If bigger is better, these burgers are up your alley.",

Beef ribs are pretty rare and getting to enjoy both in one meal even more so. The burgers are nearly always cooked perfectly.

So the next time I ordered a burger- simple cheeseburger, and my goodness it was phenomenal. The meat is hearty and it's very juicy, so you will definitely use your napkins. They have a nice patio out back when it's warm, but the inside is cozy. The service that I've had has always been excellent. The waitress that I had last taught me the \"correct\" way to tap the glass ketchup bottle. Craving a burger? Come here. Also, the potato salad is fantastic. It's also a nice switch up from traditional fries.",

Was happy they had Magic Hat #9 on draft too! It tastes so much better on draft!  Burgers were cooked nicely, I alllmost wish mine was a tad more pink on the inside. The mayo was soooo excellent. I didn't used to like mayo on anything until I tried it on burgers, specifically theirs, and maybe one other place.  Place has been around forever, and my parents used to walk here with me for dinner when I was a kid. The kind of place where you walk in and you might see someone you knew from 10 years ago or more... but even if you don't know anyone, they're friendly and will treat you like family or at least a good friend! One of the things I miss most about living in Pittsburgh and this neighborhood in general.",

We walked through a dark alley (skurry), where we parked, into this nice little restaurant.  The building itself looked old but cozy.  Maybe a little too cozy as our seats were rather cramped.  Although known to be the best burger in the 'burgh (alliteration ftw), I went with the steak sandwich because I was on company money.  But it was just a piece of steak on a piece of rye bread.  The steak nor the fries were that memorable, but were filling.  The service was good and homely.",

It isn't a hit or miss place. I always know the food and service will be excellent. I introduced my parents to Tessaro's when they visited awhile back and now my mom asks to go every time they're in town. I worked for a long time in the service industry and I know what I'm talking about when I say Tessaro's is the epitome of well-run and well staffed. There's often a wait, but it's worth it.

The waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him. Yelp says good for kids they said we have a high chair. The waitress was about as warm and friendly as a night in spent sleeping in the snow naked. The potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par.

They were just hitting the lunch hour but when my friend arrived, we were seated right away.  The restaurant has an old-world feel without being musty or worn out. Service was prompt and friendly. The space is a bit crowded but not oppressively so.  On to the main point - burger, burger, burger. A 1/2 lb burger topped with any variety of fixings on a nice soft bun. Expertly cooked to order (I usually prefer medium to medium-well). It's True they only have home fries on offer but I felt they were a better complement than regular french fries.  All in all, a very pleasant experience. I would happily go back again... once my cholesterol recovers.",

    "text": "I've been going to Tessaro's for years. Every trip back to the 'Burgh wouldn't be complete without a lunch or dinner there. It's my go-to place for meeting friends for a meal when we want something tried and True with no froufrou. And I am never disappointed.   I have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro's partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them \"to order\" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked. She didn't seem bothered by my request. And honestly, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference. That being said, it still was the best tasting perfectly cooked burger I have had in a long, long time. With all the new specialty burger joints popping up across the country, I still dare any one of them to stand off side by side with Tessaro's. Our usual picks are the Deli and the Bacon-Blue Cheeseburger, but you can pick any burger on the menu and be satisfied, and then some. I also love their home fries. Yummy! The marinated gourmet chicken sandwich is also a winner if you aren't into red meat!   One of my other favorites at Tessaro's which I have to admit I haven't had in eons since we haven't made it there for lunch recently is the tuna melt on rye. It has been on the menu forever. If you want one, you have to go for lunch as even though its on the lunch menu, they refuse to make it at dinner :(   The atmosphere here is strictly neighborhood bar/restaurant. Nothing fancy. I am sometimes put off by the way they offer seating (first-come, first-serve) and they will try to cram four people at a table that is meant for only three. If they are not scrambling for tables to seat people waiting, I'd ask for another less cramped table and wait; but on a crowded night, take the first thing available or you could be waiting a long, long time.",

And we had to wait to be seated and it was not super cheap, so all these things combined make me less than thrilled with the experience. Perhaps if I had the burger cooked medium rare, things would be different, but I still crown Industry reigning king of all (Pitts) burgers. However, things are not bad by any means, they just aren't the absolute best, as I was hoping for. And there wasn't enough bread to hold the burger, causing me to do the unthinkable and use a knife! The highlight of the night though, was hearing a man refer to his wife as \"my darling\" when she wasn't even within earshot.",

Even with the bump-out they did about 10 years ago, it gets crowded during peak mealtimes.  That said, if the possibility of the waiting in line and maybe getting jostled or shoehorned into your chair to eat isn't off-putting, the food is great.  While the place is known for its burgers (they are some of the best I've ever had) they also have ribs on Thursday and a Mexican night as well.  Every night they have grilled seafood which is good.    The service is efficient--they get the orders right, they are pleasant, but not overly so.  I've also found them to be attentive, even when the place is crawling with customers.  As other reviewers pointed out, they don't have a deep fryer so you can't get fries with your burger.  But their home fries are really, really good.  So much so that you really will not miss the absence of fries.  Their potato salad is also good, a close second.    It's a bit sad going there these days since Kelly, the restaurant patriarch, passed away.  But the restaurant goes on!  A final note:  they do not have a dessert menu and send everyone over to Crazy Mocha next door (their desserts are only OK).",

My breakfast burger was decent--the runny egg was great and everything a runny egg should be, but the bacon was limp, soggy with its own fat, and just blended into the sandwich without a distinct flavor. The homefries were okay, but a little under-seasoned. I will say the service was excellent. If I were reviewing the service alone, I would give it 4-5 stars.

To appreciate Tessaro's you have to accept that you wont get fries with your hamburger (but the home fries are delicious).  And you have to accept that reservations are not accepted, and you will sit uncomfortably close to the party next to you. I love Tessaro's because like most Pittsburghers, I appreciate when an establishment keeps its traditions. And I always know what to expect.",

    "text": "We were in Pittsburgh for a wedding and saw this place had amazing reviews so we decided to give it a try. The tables are very close together so having a conversation feels awkward because you are sitting right next to strangers. We both ordered a cheeseburger, medium and medium well. Mine come out medium rare and my partner's came out well done. The burgers were not seasoned. I got roasted red potatoes and my partner got rice. The potatoes were not seasoned and came with melted butter, which tasted and looked like oil. The rice was soggy and also unseasoned. The decor surprised me because it is very casual and cheap looking (denim tablecloths) but the way the restaurant is described makes it sound more like a fun pub/ grill joint. They do have a full bar, but no drink menu. So if you are seated in the back like we were, you have to ask your server if they have this or that and you do not know what the price of anything will be. Our waitress was wonderful--helpful and friendly. Overall, I would not recommend this place, and encourage guests/ visitors to eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "Char-grilled burgers, big ones, that's what you'll find at Tessaro's in Bloomefield.  Besides having great hamburgers, Tessaro's has a rich history.  It's been around for years, and has enjoyed continued success.  The continued success can be attributed to the atmosphere, wood- grilled food, and the wait staff, many of whom who have been around for years. Stop by Tessaro's for a hamburger if you haven't already, it's truly an experience to behold.  If you come on a Friday night, you can expect to wait for a while.  It's even difficult to get in the door, because the bar is along the right side (as you enter) and hungry hamburger-eaters, and bar patrons are busy washing off the work week.  Tessaro's attracts an eclectic crowd; there are all types of people enjoying the interesting atmosphere that Tessaro's provides.  Expect to smell smoke when you walk in, and plenty of it.  There is ventilation in Tessaro's, but I imagine it's not as effective as it could be.  The benefit of the lack of ventilation is two-fold, first, it prepares your taste buds for tasty char-grilled meat, and secondly, it acts as cologne so you can reminisce about your meal a full day later. Tessaro's is a small establishment.  You'll have to squeeze around tables and people to get to your seat.  It's not a quiet place either, but that's ok.  It's kind of fun eating next to the people that share the same affliction you do- the need for a good burger!  The servers are good at their jobs, they have to be in order to keep up with the large crowds that pact Tessaro's during the week and weekends.   I always order the cheeseburger ($8.25) with cheddar.  It comes with slaw and home fries if you want both.  I always order my burgers medium rare; that's the perfect temperature for me.  When you bite into your first Tessaro's burger it's a fantastic experience.  You can taste the grill history, i.e. the proteins of the grilled past.  A burger cooked on a grill that has been seasoned for years is much different than eating a patty of meat from a flat grill.  The meat is succulent and delicious. The bun is soft and fresh, and the home fries and slaw perfectly complement each other.  If you're not up for a burger, try the Filet Mignon, ($25.95) New York Strip Steak ($23.95), or the Pork Chops ($14.95 for a half cut, $20.95 for a full) and a half Grilled Chicken ($15.95) . If you're a Pittsburgher, and haven't tried Tessaro's it's time to take a trip to Bloomefield.  The atmosphere, and hardwood grilled food will keep you coming back for more.",

    "text": "Tessaro's was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across America.  I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.  After it all, I still see Tessaro's as one of the best burgers I've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.  I typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro's serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you're at McDonald's.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.  My first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I'm not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro's, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.  My side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.  When you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro's you order a burger.",

The decor is a little interesting - denim tablecloth, wood and vinyl booths, and red christmas bows on the lamps? My big gripe with the place was the lack of space between tables. When we were seated, the hostess had to literally pull the table out, let me and my friend sit and then push it in, so we were nice and tight between the benches and the table.

My fears were relatively unfounded.  Tessaro's is still  the same warm, local and friendly place it's been for decades.  The new ownership retained everything that mattered -- and a few things that are problematic.  I need to say that I'm a steak fan.  Good steak.  So I'm always just a BIT disappointed because the steaks at Tessaro's have too much gristle.  My friends, however, always order the burgers and they swear by them.    What continues to disappoint me are the little things.  The bread is NEVER fresh.  It always feels and tastes a few days old.  The salads also taste packaged.  The vegetable side dishes are limp.  I once commented about this to my server at Tessaro's.  Her reply?  \"Oh, honey, this is a bar-and-grill, not a fine dinin' establishment!\"  I laughed and had to agree.  So go for the burgers.  Get the potato sides.  Have a good cold beer to go with it and you won't be disappointed.    I see others say that the tables are too tightly packed and you overhear others' conversations.  That's one of the features of a place like this.  It's like one big family meal where you're always meeting new family members.    One rule I've come to live by, though:  \"Never order fish/seafood in a steak place and never order steak in a fish/seafood restaurant.\"  That applies to Tessaro's too.  My wife has NEVER had a decent fish entree at Tessaro's.  Not a slam, but an acknowledgment that you can't be everything to everybody.    A nod of thanks to the \"new\" ownership for keeping the place comfortable and friendly.",
