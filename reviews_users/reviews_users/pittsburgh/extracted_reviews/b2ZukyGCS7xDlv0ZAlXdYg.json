I plan to come back again for a good meal but I don't don't think that it will be on my list of Lawrenceville recommendations.",

The eggplant parm needs some help. Nobody wants the skin on an eggplant and they tasted, I don't know - just not like fresh fried eggplant mom would make. I know you can't have that in a restaurant, but something needs to change with that.",

    "text": "We've been here now with kids and with friends and both kinds of experiences have been great! The atmosphere is comfortably warm with the wood fired oven on display in the corner. There are TVs showing sports, but it doesn't distract from their casual fine dining vibe. The staff all introduce themselves and really make you feel welcome. S/o to Gina, Franco, Chrissy, Maureen, & Joel. The servers are knowledgeable about all of the dishes and made some great suggestions on which ones to try. The bartenders serve up a mean Bloody Mary and there are 16 beers and ciders on tap to choose from. The Southern Tier 2x IPA was my favorite. You could easily eat a meal or just have drinks with friends at the bar area. We tried a variety of apps, main dishes, and pizzas. Pizzas were all winners and cooked right in view of the tables. They are easily big enough to share. For the rest, the stand outs were the stuffed hot peppers, calamari, gnocchi, \"bocce ball\" meatballs, ravioli, and veal scallopini. The tirimisu was delicate and delicious, but man oh man, the pecan ball was one of the best desserts that I have ever had. There is a kids menu, although mine didn't order from it, and it looks like the lasagna and chicken Caesar salad are a steal for their price, although we have yet to try them. The restaurant is right next to the Clemente Museum. There is a lot across from the restaurant, a rarity in L-vile, and street parking was also easy to get. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I really try and avoid saying anything if I do not have anything nice to say but on Saturday, July 28th we had a notably bad experience here.  It was clear that they were understaffed and the hostess didn't jump in to help until service was already going south.  After our appetizers-our drinks were never refreshed-they then brought over two drinks that were for another table.  When the order was finally taken the completed drinks sat on the side of the bar for 20 minutes (we watched) before we could stop someone to ask them to bring them over.  When the entrees arrived it was clear they had sat under the warmer for awhile but really disappointing they forgot my husbands order all together.  The rest of us ate while he sat there.  Then when his pizza was finished we watched it sit on the counter until finally we flagged someone and asked them to bring it.  They questioned if it was even the right one but then the hostess said well it is yours now.  She should've said-I am so sorry to be bringing this so late.  He asked to have it wrapped and the hostess and pizza chef thought it was because he didn't like it (yes we heard you talking).  They clearly had no idea of the timing problem.  Towards the end of the meal the hostess brought us a piece of cake and two forks when we were a party of 4-she never said \"so sorry about the service please take this for the table\".  She just put it in front of me and handed me a fork and my sister a fork.  The waitress was great and apologized several times but she was stuck in the kitchen the entire time helping.  We did enjoy the food but it is a shame that this hostess was unable to manage better under stressful circumstances and provide an appropriate front of house response when things started going bad.",

We got the calamari and stuffed banana pepper appetizers, and the banana peppers were definitely good and spicy. They also bring complimentary bread and dipping oil to the table which is nice. For entrees, the eggplant parmesean was definitely the stand out dish and was a HUGE, you get two meals out of it. As for pasta, the gnocchi themselves were good, but the only sauce our group cared for was the marinara. The bolognese tasted like taco meat and lacked flavor as did the vodka sauce. We split the prosciutto and arugula pizza, and it was way overpriced at $19. The crust was good, but flavor totally lacking. Poor quality prosciutto that tasted like lunchmeat ham. Piccolo forno and driftwood oven are where to go for pizza in the neighborhood. Overall, meh, but get the eggplant parm and skip the overpriced pizza if you go",

    "text": "I was really excited to have additional options in a neighborhood that has truly incredible food. Alida's seemed to potentially fill the much needed niche for a casual Italian restaurant/sports type of bar that is locally owned and provided an alternative to my usual favorites (Senti, Morcilla and Umami) very close to my home. I have been there 7 times since they opened for both dine in and carry out. The food is good (although it is tough when Piccolo Forno and Senti are close by) but not great, but the price point more than made up for the discrepancy. The service has been the bigger issue. I recognize that they are a new restaurant, which is why I was willing to overlook occasional lapses in service. In addition, some of the bartenders have been great when I have gone by to get food to go. However, I was taken aback by the service this evening. There was only one other person at the bar and a few patrons in The restaurant. I sat down to order -there was a bartender and a lady who may have been the manager. I recognize that they were busy but I was completely ignored, and no one even asked if I wanted a menu. In essence, they made me feel as though I was not welcome. After being ignored, I decided to go one block down the street to Senti, where I was immediately acknowledged, and had someone take my order. Granted, they are two different restaurants, but there should be a similar level of hospitality regardless of the type of establishment.   I sincerely hope the management realizes that service is important. Given the many options in Lawrenceville, I will not go back again, even if the restaurant is a block away. It's really unfortunate, since they could have filled a potential niche in the area.",

    "text": "Tried Alida's with my partner this past Friday evening and I have to admit...after years of trying to find a decent Italian restaurant, I believe that this is as close as it's ever gonna get. Newly opened, the interior is warm, great bar, very good wine list, and great service. We started out with the Calamari, which was steamed in a tomato broth and not breaded and fried like most restaurants do.  It was amazingly tender and the broth was sweet.  It was also accompanied by a portion of marinara which was home made. From there we both had Italian Wedding soup....I know, I know...who doesn't have this?  This was so smooth and flavorful and loaded with escarole, meatballs and pastini with a broth that was so flavorful, I just wanted to savor it.   As an entree I had the Alfredo Tagliatelle with scallops and shrimp.  The Alfredo sauce was rich, smooth and creamy.  The seafood was perfectly cooked.  My only criticism here would be to remove the shrimp tails so that you don't wind up with alfredo sauce all over your fingers. M partner had the Rigatoni with Rabbit Ragu.  He liked it to a point and only regretted that the rabbit was in marinara and not a brown gravy. Undaunted, we moved on to dessert.  I had peach and apple cobbler and my dining companion had the limoncello cake. The cobbler was very good.  Only criticism would be to take it out early to let it sit awhile before serving.  No criticisms at all on the cake.  When they say lemon...they mean lemon.  Great flavor and texture. Our server was wonderful, humorous, professional, personable, helpful with suggestions and above all else....human! Oh...one more thing...as everything is made from scratch in-house...the very very best is the chef's bread.  To...die...for!!!",

I think he was asked to leave shortly afterward because his singing didn't last long. I don't think that is a regular occurrence here, but the food wasn't spectacular enough to bring us back.",

First and foremost I have to say the service we received tonight was spectacular! Joel was so knowledgeable, attentive, and had an excellent personality. We ordered the fried zucchini appetizer and you can tell it was hand breaded and extremely fresh. We each got a salad with our dinner and the house balsamic was amazing! They also make their own ranch and my husband loved it. I ordered the chicken parmesan and my husband ordered the the sausage pasta with vodka sauce. Both were excellent. The chicken was so moist and the sauce was very tasty. I tried my husband's pasta and the vodka sauce was fabulous. It was such a great dining experience and the price was reasonable also. For everything we got I expected the bill to be much higher. Another plus to this place is that they have FREE PARKING!!!! That is very rare for Lawrenceville or the Strip district. They have two lots one across the street which is gravel or the lot next to the Clemente museum. I highly recommend this restaurant!!! Oh, and although we did not try the pizza we saw a few and they all looked scrumptious! We will be ordering pizza next time!",

An appetizer and a pizza was the perfect amount of food for two people to share, and the quality of the pizza was fantastic.   On top of the food being absolutely delicious, the waiter that we had (I wish I had remembered to write his name down) was probably the nicest waiter I've ever had in my life.   If anyone from the restaurant sees this, the waiter that was working around 8:30 on August 1 deserves a raise!",

I LOVED the fried zucchini appetizer. They slice the zucchini thin in long, wide strips before battering and frying and they were so much more delicious than the usual stick o' zucchini. I also love their ravioli. Parking is pretty easy at night. Lot across the street or one 3 doors down for a museum that is closed at night.",

    "text": "It was a Saturday night and we tried to order a bottle of red wine but was told the entire restaurant was out of red wine bottles.  The waitress then offered us \"mark's private stash\" with bottles starting around $120.  Why the restaurant felt no need to try to accommodate us is beyond me and why they ran out of red wine bottles on a Saturday is just totally poor management.  Along with the fact that they don't train their wait staff to offer a remedy or a discount is poor service and poor management.  It took about 15 minutes to get our single glasses of wine, 35-40 minutes to get two extremely simple appetizers and we were one of four tables in the restaurant, granted one was a large party, their inability to get out two simple appetizers while preparing dinner meals is just embarrassing.  Again, poor management.  When our food finally came, three of the four were wrong.  The baked eggplant was actually eggplant lasagna.  Two of us ordered the farfalle off the menu and asked to have vodka sauce added to it since the waitress said it's just the pasta, meat, veggies and then oil.  We were served plain farfalle with sauce, none of the meat, cheese or veggies. We sent it back to get the correct meal and had to wait while the other couple we were with had their meals.  NOTHING was offered for all the inconveniences, nor apologies offered, absolutely nothing.  I'd avoid this establishment as they clearly have a management problem and don't know how to take care of their patrons.",

The atmosphere and decor is very pleasing to the eye, very comfortable without over doing it. We started out with our usual appetizer, Zucchini which was lightly breaded and very good. I ordered  the Chicken Romano, which I highly recommend. My husband had the Veal Scallopino, which he really enjoyed. We tried a side of the Saffron Risotto, which tasted just like the Northern Italians have been making for over 50 years. We ended the meal with a pecan ball, which completed our dinner nicely.  My husband and I eat our every weekend and we are glad we found their gem of a restaurant. A nice addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood.  We are looking forward to taking friends on our next visit!",

For the appetizer we had their sauteed calamari which was excellent, and for our main we had their Autunno Bianca Pizza which was delicious. The only change I would like to see would be for them to offer a couple of draft beers with a lower alcohol content. The selection of  draft beer with 5.2 or lower alcohol content was extremely limited.   Also there are two parking lots available, one across the street and one two doors down the street.  We will definitely return to this restaurant.",

We're hard on Italian food since we've been to Italy multiple times and my husband's part Sicilian. This was some of the best Italian in the city.   Here's what we had. Decided to share two different entrees so we could try multiple things. Started off by making our own pasta with gnocchi, vodka sauce and a meatball. Gnocchi is my favorite pasta and most people do it wrong. They did it right. It was so soft and delicious that it melted in your mouth as did the meatballs. My husband's mother makes meatballs that are out of this world so he's super hard to please when it comes to meatballs. He and I both loved them. The sauce was also very good. It was a nice surprise that it came with wedding soup, which was very tasty. When I saw the wood fired oven and a man making the pizza dough in the air right in front of you, we had to also try the pizza. Their Margherita Pizza reminded us of the one we had in Sorrento, Italy.   When you go to places, it's hard to find a place that has good food and also great service. This place had both. The hostess Maureen was very nice when she sat us and came around multiple times to check on us and visit. The two servers who took care of us were also great and made sure we had enough to drink, which I love. I hate when places make you beg.   All in all, it was a great experience. We'll definitely be back. Go try it! Yum!",

The Primavera pizza (basil, mushrooms and roasted peppers) as well as the Margherita pizza are my top orders on visits. These wood-fires babies are lip-smackingly scrumptious. Couple one of these with an order of succulent balls (of the bocce persuasion) and you've got yourself a meal fit for  a queen...or king.  Other memorable menu items would be the wedding soup and Alida's salad.",

When I arrived I was told I could park there safely since they own a portion of that lot.  I came in for lunch and pretty much had the whole place to myself. They have a bar off to the side with a couple of TV sets. My waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu choices. I've always loved meatball hoagies but never ordered them since they are usually served in hoagie buns.  Here they are served in thin paninis. Along with my sandwich I got a side of French Fries and ordered a cup of wedding soup. Alida's serves free bread with dipping sauce but believe me with the portion sizes you are getting there is no way I could even finish a slice of that bread.  The soup came fairly quickly with crackers. It was spot on delicious! Shortly afterwards I got my panini and although it was huge I was glad the panini was on the thin side. Meatballs were very good and very filling! Nothing special about the fries. They are the kind you pretty much get anywhere.  My waitress showed me dinner, drink, and dessert menus but there was no way I could even order dessert after all that food. Price of my lunch was fairly reasonable too.  Alida's Woodfire Cucina sits right next to the Clemente museum and at the juncture of Penn Ave and Butler St in lower Lawrenceville. Having the free parking helps since they do have a small sign outside indicating parking with an arrow facing forward but there is nothing telling you which is their lot without going inside. I'm glad I took a chance and was able to get that matter clarified.",

In terms of the food, we only tried the pizza, but I will say that Alida's probably has one of my new favorite margherita pies. Crust, sauce, everything was spot on.

We grabbed drinks and ordered the stuffed banana peppers and primavera pizza to share. They gave us bread and oil as we waited. The spicy oil was good and bread was ehh. It wasn't warm or special on any way.  The banana peppers arrived and we were done for! They were huge!!! We each ate one and couldn't eat much more, but boy was it delicious! The was a nice blend of sausage and peppers. It was also quite spicy! We didn't think banana peppers could make us sweat like that.  The pizza came and it was really good and turned out to be a nice balance to the stuffed banana peppers. We each could muster to eat one slice and had leftovers for both of us to have lunch the following day.  The vibe is very local. People knew each other and were quite friendly. Also, as you walk in you see the wood fire oven and know they're serious about their pizza. It's cool to see the people making the pizza as you wait, too. Will be back!!",

We got the fried Calamari and Autunno Bianca. Our waitress told us that is her favorite and one of the most popular pizza. The calamari was good and  so was the pizza. When I first got it, to be honest, I was not impressed with it. I was expecting more, I felt like it was lacking flavors. At that point, I was giving this pizza a 5.5 out of 10. But shortly after I ate more of it, I realized it was much better now. I'm not sure it was the parmesan cheese + hot pepper made the difference or the hot sausage flavor started to kick in. It was very flavorful and the crust was prefect. I had some leftovers the next day and ended up loving it more! I will definitely go back there and try out some different pizza or pasta.  They do have happy hours but it is for drinks only, I think it was $1 off wine $2 off draft or the other way around. It is not a bad deal but I wish they would bring on some food specials for happy hour!",

    "text": "We had a really delightful dinner here last night.  We had just visited the Clemente Museum nearby on Penn St, did a quick Yelp search and Alida's it was!!  Upon entering, there were three large groups and all appeared to be locals.  Great!  Very nice draft beer list for a place this size; kudos to the bartender who is a True professional; checked all glasses for spots after washing.  Waitress helped us while a waiter took care of the groups.  She did a nice job helping us with questions/requests.  Soup of the day was ham/bean/potato; turned out to be green beans but this was a surprising hit.  Very rich broth was the key.  I went with old faithful, Veal Parmesan with side of spaghetti; it was excellent.  Red sauce had some depth of flavor; pasta al dente; multi benne!!  Wife had a large salad with sauteed shrimp added; she loved it.  Bread is delicious and olive oil blend was unique and delicious.  Free parking lot is next to museum.  Great experience",

They have great appetizers- the fried calamari is my favorite- and they also have homemade gnocchi and black pepper tagliatelle. I had the tagliatelle and I wasn't disappointed. It was sort of lacking salt though. The staff was super attentive and patient. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We've always wanted to try this place but unfortunately we did not enjoy. Fried Zucchinni and Fried Calamari we're not good at all. The oil seemed old and they were so greasy. The limoncello drink I ordered wasn't good at all, I'm pretty sure the egg whites should have been diluted into the drink. We will not return :/",

    "text": "An Italian restaurant starts and ends with the sauce and Alida's passes this test. Nice consistency and savory without being too spicy. Most importantly, not loaded with sugar. With that out of the way,the rest of the review. This charming new Italian spot is quaint and homey. The menu is without pretense. Just good classic Italian comfort food. In the app menu the stuffed peppers and \"bocce balls\" are all-star stand outs. That said... Get the pizza. An Italian restaurant is judged on sauce but a pizza is judged on crust. The woodfired pizza crust here is perfect. Rolled thin, it's crispy on the outside but soft and doughy in the center. The toppings just add to the overall pie after that.   The service is friendly and attentive without being a nuisance but do expect to be encouraged to eat like you're at your Italian grandmother's home. The bartenders are quick and friendly as well! Ask for Franco!  Highly encouraged spot... Just stay open later!",

    "text": "We went to dinner on a Tuesday night and had pretty incredible food. There were only two other parties the whole time we were there which makes me concerned at this restaurant will not last more than a year. There are a few too many TVs which lost a star and the wine/beer lists were ok. lasagne, fried zucchini, brownie cheese cake were awesome!   Salad/veggies were very fresh.  My kids can be a pain but they loved the pizza and liked the chicken fingers. I hope this place lasts.",
