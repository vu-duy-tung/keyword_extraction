    "text": "Nice sports bar in the burbs.    I grew up in the South Hills and have seen this location transition between a various number of restaurants.  I remember it as the South Park Inn, a Country Western Bar, some other location, I also remember it burning down.  After the variety of different places it has been, I think the South Park Club House is a place that will stick.  The place has been completely rebuilt and everything is clean, nice, and new on the inside.  There is a fairly large bar area with about 10-15 TV's surrounding it.  There is also a separate dining area which still has TVs.  There is also a small arcade area that is good for kids (I believe they host birthday parties here occasionally).    The food is standard pub grub and is decent...nothing to write home about but completely acceptable food for a sports bar setting.  The bar is nice and has a pretty good beer selection for the area.  Last time I was there they had East End, Bell's, Victory, and a few others crafts on draft in addition to the standard macros.    Overall, this is a good spot to catch a game, grab some grub, and have a beer.  The options of nice places to do this in the area are fairly limited so given the location it is a top notch place.    It has become my go-to spot when I am in town.",

OK, i did order a seasonal beer, and was well aware of how expensive it is to purchase, but when the markup is well over 100% I believe that is outrageous. I had expected it to be no more than $11 or 12 a bottle, imagine my surprise when I got my bill and I had paid $16 a bottle. I will not return to this establishment just because of this, I understand needing to make a profit, but this is just robbery. I know I can buy a case of what I drank for $83 a case meaning each bottle would cost me $6.92 each(12 bottles to a case), and I am sure since they buy product in bulk they get an even better price than I do at the distributor.",

Last Monday, we thought we would have dinner and use of Enjoy coupon. We walked in and there were 7 people in the bar and dining room. Our server walked over and never said hello, simply \"you know you need to order entrees to use that coupon\"!  Well, no we didn't know. That was never the case before. Since sandwiches cost almost as much as entrees, what's the difference?  But, we ordered a fish dinner, which disappoint in size, but was cold. I also paid extra for a small house salad. My husband had chicken stir fry and said it was a total mistake. No taste at all. He asked for soy sauce, which they don't carry. Our server seemed to get friendlier after the initial introduction. However, when my husband asked if there was a beer special (think Happy Hour), she said we have over 40 beers! So, we still don't know if there was a \"beer special\"! You would think when you're serving 7 patrons in a restaurant, you could be more accommodating. I think the main attraction of this place is pizza and sandwiches, which we've had many times. My suggestion is do not even be in the Enjoy Book next year, if you want to keep long time customers. You lost us!",

    "text": "Held a wedding rehearsal dinner here for 18 people. The room is perfect for smaller gatherings and was clean and the tables were set up nicely.  The room was a bit dark, but this actually was ok with us.  We had prime rib, stuffed chicken and pecan crusted tilapia on the menu - along with red skinned potatoes, green beans and broccoli.  Soft drinks, rolls and salad were included.  The meal was served on time, and we had a dedicated server to attend to our needs.  He was superb.  Since we did not include alcohol, he was perfectly happy running tabs for our guests and kept drinks filled.    The stuffed chicken was the group's favorite.  It was delicious.  The tilapia was also very good, and the potatoes were scrumptious.  There was plenty of food for everyone - we even took home leftovers - and some people had two helpings of everything.  The only criticism I have was the prime rib.  It was a bit overcooked and tough.  In defense of the facility, prime rib is difficult to keep warm in steamers - and as such, we understood.    I would not hesitate to use this facility again, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice and reasonably priced venue for smaller gatherings.  We were treated excellently!  In the future, we'd skip the prime rib and add a different meat from their ample catering menu.  Excellent place - easy to make reservations - great staff - delicious food - ample parking...what can I say but KUDOS!!!",

The wings are fantastic, both boneless and bone in. Ordered the quesadilla as an appetizer and it was huge. I was extremely pleased with the taste as well. Can't beat the everyday $8 Bud Light pitchers either.   I went again a second time just to be sure and again, I was very satisfied. Service was friendly, food was quick, and overall a great experience. The bar inside is huge and offers plenty of TVs for sporting events.   I will likely be regular based off of my the first couple experiences and anyone who is visiting me outside of Pittsburgh, I will be sure to bring them here.",

Stuffed chicken breast (very good),  beef in sauce (just ok, tasted like BBQ sauce), roasted red potatoes (delicious),  and green beans ( good).  What set them apart was the service.

Shame on the entire staff from management to cooks and wait staff to not know what cut of meat you have on your menu.  If you don't sell enough prime rib to keep it on hand then warn your guests that they will be receiving their own version of prime rib (aka overdone steak) and let them choose to change their mind of what they order.  ************** see picture of prime rib/NY strip *****************",

    "text": "I've been the The South Park Clubhouse several times. When I think about The South Park Clubhouse, I think of somewhere I want to be. A Clubhouse where you can get awesome food, drinks and have great atmosphere. The atmosphere was so-so, the drinks were great but the food left a lot to be desired. First things first, I believe that every restaurant featuring any type of special should give the patrons a list of those specials from the beginning. I can't see a board that is 50+ feet away and a little card on the table out of view doesn't help either. I ordered a more expensive drink when truly I was more happy with the special of the day. We ordered an appetizer of fried pierogies and sadly it was a disappointment. They came out on a sad plate in a sad pile, no garnish, no nothing. A plate of mini Mrs. T's with a container of sour cream. For the price I expected it to be a little dressed up. We ordered a Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza which was probably the best item on the table. We also ordered a steak flatbread salad. It was a sad salad to say the least. Prepackaged salad mix which was really iceberg lettuce and a few carrots, 2 pieces of onion and some lackluster steak. It did have grill marks but wasn't really worth the price in any way. Our server, Mark, was attentive and I don't blame him for the sad food. There could be so much more done with the food and it's just not there.",

But it seems recently the service quality has degraded continuously.   We were seated rather quickly but the waitress took awhile to come see us. Didn't bother to introduce herself or seemed interested in serving at all because we rarely dealt with her the rest of the night. Another server, a bus-boy and even what appeared to be the manager all helped deliver the food and serve us instead. Very bizarre and somewhat unprofessional. We had an appetizer of the spinach artichoke dip and I went for a Buffalo Chicken Wrap. The food quality was really quite nice but the service was virtually non-existent. To make matters worse, when I visited the restroom, the same girl that was supposed to be serving was chatting with her friends instead. That's probably the one thing I disliked the most, and as a result it reflected in the tip we paid her. You cannot expect a fair tip if you're not even interested in doing your job.",

Also, a well's banana bread beer was $7.50?! Nowhere is price marked for their drafts but I have had this and several high-alcohol content IPAs at places much closer to Pittsburgh and have not paid $7.50.

Drink specials vary depending on the night of the week. Thursday had a $3 Absolute deal and specials on Fat Tire.  For dinner I enjoyed the French onion soup crock and house salad with pretzel breadstick. My father in law loves the pizzas. I've also had a calzone that was delicious.",

Not the type of place you would expect to have great food.  If you like buffalo style food you will really like this place as they have a lot of different varieties.  Buffalo chicken nachos, dip, tots, buffalo shrimp, wings, sandwiches, and more.  Great buffalo flavor and great ranch to go with it.  Some of my other favorites are the Rueben, chicken bacon ranch flatbread, and chicken Caesar salad.",

Their fries are excellent and we really like the white Mac n cheese.  My kids eat really well here also. Their dining room is big and spacious, I don't feel on top of the other people in the room. They also have a separate bar area which always seems busy. Another plus when taking the kids is they have a small room with some video games.",

Came out as a three slab ground lamb with one piece of lettuce and a dribble of sauce. Last Friday, 6/15, twelve people went to slaughter! One person order a calzone, brought out a burnt and cold in the middle! They gladly replaced with a more burnt calzone but was warm! Another one of our guest ordered a fish dinner. Was brought out half hour after other dinners were served. Yep, cold, sent back. Waited another half hour. Served barely warm. What was to be a hour and half dinner turned into over two hours. Manager compted the two dinners and told us that we are not the only customers complaining tonight! I will never suggest this place to any more dinner nights to our group. OR to any one of our friends! Did not want to give a star but had to.",

I should have known something was wrong when there was no wait and the dining room was half empty on a Friday night.  Our appetizer was served without the side of ranch we requested and without any plates.  While waiting for the waitress to come back so we could ask for plates, the main dishes were served so now we had a table full of food but no plates.  We did ask the food runner for plates and the missing ranch and eventually they were brought.    The steak hoagie did not come with any dressing or mayo on it so it was very dry.  The fish hoagie also did not come with any tarter sauce.  It was just fried fish and an enormous bun. We had finished the steak hoagie and I ate my half of the fish sandwich with ketchup before we flagged down another waitress to ask her to bring us tarter sauce.   Our waitress asked \"you guys ready for your check\" as she walked past the table. Then a few minutes later she put the check on the table again as she walked past.  We needed a to-go box for the appetizer we didn't get to eat and figured the only way to get it was to not pay the check until the waitress actually stopped and paid a tiny bit of attention to us.   When she finally brought the box, we paid the check in cash as to not have to wait for her to decide to bring back my card.   Too long, didn't read... We had to ask for plates. We had to ask for ranch. We had to ask for tarter sauce. We had to ask for to-go box.  Most that we had to ask other waitresses for as ours was missing most of the time. We never got refills on our drinks.",

I got a fish sandwich with cheese fries. 2 big pieces of delicious fish, I had to get an extra bun to go, because I couldn't eat the other piece of fish. My daughter got pizza and a salad which was also very good! Staff was very nice and helpful, our waiter was Danyelle, she was awesome! Thanks for a great experience, will definitely recommend this place to others! Have no idea why others have had bad experiences in the past and left bad reviews, but we will definitely be going back there soon!",

The place was packed! Being that there was a Friday night and there was a penguins game, this was to be expected. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. The hostesses were very nice and seated us as quickly as they could. We also requested to be in the bar area so we could have a better view of the game, and they were happy to accommodate. Now, don't come here and expect a gourmet meal. It's a typical Pittsburgh bar food scene. Expect that, and you won't be disappointed. My boyfriend had a burger and fries with a side salad and enjoyed his food. We also split the mozzarella stick appetizer which was tasty. I ordered the hot buffalo boneless wings with fries and they were good as well. We didn't have alcohol, just some waters and iced tea and our total was $35. It seemed a little steep for mediocre bar food, but it wasn't super overpriced. Our server was friendly and did well for how busy it was. I was the most impressed by the hostesses, who I observed walking around, when it had slowed down, checking on the tables to see if anyone needed another drink, or needed assistance with anything else. I always appreciate great customer service and hard working employees. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will probably return again for a game.",
