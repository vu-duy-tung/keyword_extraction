I even liked the red sauce, when we usually are white sauce people. Maybe I've been converted. Also tried the fettuccine alfredo and it didn't disappoint.

(Sorry so excited about the food that I didn't take s picture ) Other friend had Penne with chicken. Flavor was great and sauce had a nice rich flavor and was not at all oily like at all like a lot of places. This was a lot of food which we all ended up sharing and still had leftovers. The new owners were both there, they were very polite and friendly. Will definitely go back next time I am in the area.",

It was kind of dark inside, and what sounded like Italian Peter Gabriel was playing from the speakers. I imagine they do mostly a takeout/delivery business. It's not set up like your typical pizzeria, as they have a closed kitchen and no pizza by the slice.  I ordered a half meatball hoagie with fries and a can of soda, came in under $10. Portion size was generous; the fries were a whole plate.   Honestly not sure what the fuss is about. Was I able to eat again that day? No. Was it tasty? Sure. But it wasn't anything special. I got the feeling that the meatballs were from a bag, and the French fries were your typical thick cut food service variety. The toasted roll was good, as was the sauce. Overall, I didn't regret eating there, but I won't be making a habit of it.",

It's probably the highest quality food that I've ever had delivered. The chicken, bacon, ranch sub is simply stunning in structure and quality. Sliced chicken breast. Sliced tomatoes. It's just not the typical hoagie. I am sure everything else is amazing but I just get this all the time.  You've absolutely got to try the Gorgonzola Gnocci. Just split it with a friend or something because it's far too rich as the primary dish. It's absolutely incredible.  Also, their pizza is good, too. They put the toppings below the cheese, which is awesome for your favorites but not so great for folks that pick off extraneous toppings from a partners favorite pie. That's not intended to be derisive. Its clearly for the best flavor but worth knowing if your SO hates mushrooms because they're fine cut, too, so you'll never get them out and you'll feel bad.  OK, so, what's above quality of food? Nothing, right? Well, maybe packaging...  This place uses great packaging. Tidy boxes. Fries kept fresh and crispy by NOT being stowed away in styofoam. Hoagie perfectly cut in tow and bedded in foil in a box.  Yes, packaging is why I absolutely adore this place. Yes, the food is great, but it's so great because of the packaging. The fries stay crisp. The hoagies hot. and the salads fresh.  Really, this is my new favorite place and I really need to try new stuff but who can argue with their Mushroom & Pepperoni pizza and a chicken, bacon, ranch hoagie? and their gnocci. Also, the quattro fomagio was really \"delicious\" she says. \"Even much better than I anticipated it to be.\"   Who can argue with that?!?",

I needed something quick and easy, so I ordered a 12\" mushroom and pepperoni pizza. There was a choice for traditional or thin crust; I chose traditional. However, when I opened the box it definitely looked like a thin crust pizza to me. If it wasn't thin crust, then the thin crust must be paper thin. Given that it was the first time I ordered from them, I don't really have anything to compare this experience with. As far as taste and flavor, I liked their pizza. I didn't love it, but I'd definitely order from them again. Their delivery charge of only .99 cents is a real bargain. What I enjoyed most about the pizza was that I didn't find it overly greasy. Everything was nice and intact every single bite.",

After we walked in we were greeted by a server who ended up being really pleasant throughout our evening and helped us to really enjoy our meals.  Since this was the dining companion that I go out with to enjoy pizza we decided on a plain cheese pizza as well as their specialty Palermo Special (Prosciutto, Chicken, Cheddar, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Pine Nuts, Garlic Olive Oil Base & Mozzarella).  Both of the pizzas ended up being really good and I thought that the soft pine nuts on a pizza made for an intriguing pizza.  Before we left the restaurant a discussion ensued about how many stars I was going to give this place.  Initially I said 4 stars but my wife and dining companion convinced me to move it up to 5 due to the pleasantness of our waitress.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  The service was awesome and the pizza was pretty good as well!",

    "text": "I had friends from out of town in for the weekend and after spending some time out at breweries we decided to head back to my place in Westview to play some games and order a pizza. I haven't been in he area long myself and have only tried a handful of pizza joints so decided to go off of a recommendation from the owner of a local game shop called Game Masters. The suggestion was Pelegrino's and it did not disappoint. I placed a delivery order for a Large Pelegrino Special and 12 Garlic Wings. I was quoted a 45 minute delivery time and that was about spot on if not a bit earlier. The Pelegrino Special was a huge hit! It not only looked amazing but tasted equally great.  I really liked the crust and sauce while the toppings were all plentiful. There was a lot of cheese as well melted to perfection. I immediately knew this was the best pie I've had since moving to this area.  The wings on the other hand while passable weren't anything special in my opinion. They were fairly dry and not much garlic flavor. I was expecting more of a wet garlic sauce but this was more of a dusting. I think next time I would try the hot wings instead.  If you are looking for something new to try, this is the place for you!",

The gentleman who both took my delivery order and delivered it (I could tell by his thick, but very enjoyable accent and personality) was very polite and entertaining on the phone. That came across even more vividly in person at the front door.   He included two of each the blue cheese  and ranch that I ordered. I \"had to try them because they're made in house\". He was right. I had to try them. The pizza was amazing because of \"the dough made fresh daily and it's more of a Chicago style, unlike that dry stuff they serve everywhere.\" He was right again.   Don't hesitate. Order this pie and enjoy. To that gentleman (the owner as well maybe?), thanks for great food and the experience to go along.",

    "text": "Whoa, I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet! Pelegrino's pizza is located on McKnight road. The same building has been 3 other pizza places in the 4 years or so I have worked on McKnight, the best lasted a few months, the worst was out of business within one month. Given the place's track record, I had low hopes for Pelegrino's.   The manager/owner personally delivered my first order, and he was so friendly and the food wasn't bad that I ordered again the next week. Since then, I've ordered at least once a week from them. I can't say I am a huge fan of their pizza- I prefer NY style and theirs is thick, but not bad. They have baked raviolis that remind me of St. Louis, and their fettuccine alfredo w/chicken is sinfully delicious. I have tried it at Italian chains, small mom and pop places, local legends like the Village Inn in Verona, I've had it in California and Missouri and Italy, and Pelegrino's, this little pizza place, is hands-down the best I have ever had.   They also go above and beyond service-wise. I ordered (via GrubHub) some alfredo last week and asked for 2 dr. pepper cans with it as well. My cell phone was dead, so when they called and left a voicemail saying they were out of DP, I didn't get it. They got here well before the delivery time said they would, and they had gone and bought-out two bottles of Dr. Pepper to make up for them being out of it. That is CRAZY good customer service- on top of the very friendly delivery staff, the decent pricing, and the delicious food, these people go out of their way to please their customers.  If you're reading this, give them a try. You will not be disappointed!",

I mostly do delivery and anytime I put any specific instructions, they always got ignored until I found Pelegrino's. Instructions were simple, like less sauce on the wings, or more wings less dings. No other place got it right or even tried until this place. Delivery people are always polite and the food always arrives like 20 minutes before the actual time it's due (which I found out the hard way the first time and had to throw on a robe over jammies I had thought I had a bit more time to change out of, but I digress ;). The food is good - not over the top amazing but good decent food coupled with attention to detail and great delivery service - makes it a trifecta for me!",

I ordered a large traditional style pizza and a dozen wings.  The pizza was the soggiest pizza I ever had.  They might as well have made the pizza on slices of white bread that were soaked in grease for 6-9 months, high school cafeteria pizza has a way better crust than this.  On top of the soggy crust, they put about 1,000 pounds of sauce and cheese. This was the heaviest, soggiest, grossest slop of a pizza I have ever eaten. The wings were done well, not too crunchy, not too gooey but the 'hot' sauce was terrible. Maybe some people would like a dark, brown sauce like this but not me.  I was hoping for an authentic 'buffalo' flavor but these wings were just smothered in some mysterious brown sauce that packed a lot of heat but zero flavor.  Maybe this was an off night, but i'd rather have had dominos 1,000,000 times over and really, that's pretty pathetic.",

One warning... their prices are a little high (15.99 for a large pepperoni) but, given the better ingredients... it may be worth the extra cash.   The high prices may be the downfall of this place because it was a ghost town when I went in for our pie.  Give the place a try... you will not likely be disappointed.",

Finally, I ordered a Tiramisu which for dessert which was only okay. I really wanted to like this place given the glowing 5-star reviews here. I probably will give it a second chance and stick to an Italian chicken and pasta dinner of some sort. Also, I might eat in the establishment to have the food nice and fresh and hot. My food selection pics are attached.",

We were hungry and spotted this little pizza place, and we are so glad we did! They don't have pizza by the slice, unfortunately, but it's worth getting a pie. They're not unreasonably expensive. We had the pepperoni rolls (8 large ones) and the hand-tossed Pellegrino Specialty pizza. They have yummy sauce and dough! Highly recommended!",

I loved that I could order right off here and most of the food had pictures beside it which was nice!   We ordered hot and garlic parm wings, the meat calzone, and steak hogie. The wings were so yummy! They came with a side of Ranch and I'm not sure what special stuff they put in it, but it's bomb Ranch, I mean bomb bomb! The hot wasn't very spicey but they had good flavor. The meat calzone.. OMG this was to die for! I could eat this for days! The steak hogie was also very yummy!   Delivery was quick and everything came piping hot. We will for sure be ordering from here again and I am so thankful this gem is so close to home! I need this in my tummy all the time!!",

It was nice to have a pizza that offered something a little different, feta cheese, fresh garlic, shredded pepperoni and an assortment of veggies.  The pizza had a great crust and a sauce that would be most comparable to Papa Johns.  I wouldn't say that the pepperoni was \"shredded\", though. I'm not sure if it's a bad thing, but the pizza may have been a little too heavy with the toppings, which made it a little difficult to eat by hand, but for you forkers out there, this may be the place for you.  They had a friendly staff, too.",

They have a parking lot and it is easy to go in and pick up your pizza. They also have some seating available so you can eat there if you prefer. Everyone there was so friendly and nice. Excellent customer service. We were going to use the Yelp check in offer ($3 off a large specialty pizza) but the guy actually told us they had a buy one get one 50% off deal which would save us more money, which was so nice of him! If you're looking for coupons they have a bunch on the back of their paper menus which are available on the counter.  For the pizza, we got a large cheese and a large Mediterranean. They were both delicious. We don't usually get plain cheese pizzas but our friend likes them the best so we decided to give it a try, and he was right, it was sooo good. They are very generous with the tomato sauce and cheese and it was perfectly melty. The Mediterranean is a good choice if you want chicken on your pizza. It also has spinach and peppers. It was very tasty and I would definitely recommend it. Two large pizzas were more than enough for five adults and a kid. We had more than half a pie left over.  This will be our go-to pizza place anytime we are in town now!",

    "text": "This used to be our go-to pizza shop, but the service and quality has diminished significantly in the past few months. We always order through the GrubHub app. The past two orders have arrived 30-60 minutes late, the pizza has been cold and soggy, and toppings have been left off or included when requested to be left off. We've called the shop regarding the late deliveries and have been told that they received a bunch of orders at once so the estimate on delivery was incorrect. While I understand this, they have our phone number, and a simple call would set the correct expectations. I'm not sure what changed, but unfortunately we will no longer be ordering from them.",

About 4 months ago I ordered pizza for delivery and it took 2 hours to be delivered . I called after about an hour and was told it was on its way. Called 45 minutes later, eventually got my pizza. The manager gave me a coupon for my next order  I ordered about 3 weeks later and again took about 90 minutes for delivery  I decided to give this place one more chance. I ordered again last night  and yep it took almost 2 hours for delivery. Sorry I am done with this place",

The taste is there but overwhelmed by the other cheese that is placed under the fresh mozzarella. The crust is  very close to the New York crunch but not there just yet, at the same time the dough is not under done. The wings are not bad at all, well prepared sauced and not too skinny or plump.",
