    "text": "HORRIBLE FOOD AND EVEN WORSE SERVICE! Lets start with the fact that when I walked in I was told that the specials were half off appetizers margaritas. I decided to order a margarita, which I have to say was great. I also got cheese dip, which although runny, did not taste bad. I ordered from the vegetarian menu for my main course, which I guess means I only eat cheese wrapped up different ways and drowned in bland, most likely canned sauce. My friend ordered the chicken taco salad, which was basically boiled chicken over lettuce. However, her tortilla bowl the salad was in was nice and crispy. Lets note that the booth behind us started raining from the ceiling. I watched several servers walk by and do nothing. I finally told my server and he put buckets around without even mopping up the existing puddle. Apon receiving the check I was told, unapologetically, that the server was mistaken and nachos were actually what was half off and I received no discount. I also had a coupon, which after much arguing I noticed that THE COUPON WAS PRINTED OFF AFTER IT SUPPOSEDLY EXPIRED, therefore it was never possible to redeem it. My check was $32 and when split between me and my friend we got our statements to sign back as $20 each...do the math (we were charged extra from the check). I asked to speak with a manager based on everything. it took 35 minutes to finally get a manager, who wanted to argue and refuse to be reasonable. After $40 minutes of ridiculousness. I decided not to sign and refuse to pay. The restaurant ended up charging me $20, without my authorization (more than I even ordered). I plan on desputing this.",

I would call this Mexican, not so much Tex-Mex; they have chips and salsa for an appetizer, but they don't have chili, and we had a large selection of items without a fajita or any beef in sight.  Great service, great portions, great food, great variety.  A+++.",

With that being said, I think El Campesino suffices as a serviceable Mexican restaurant in the North HIlls region.  When you walk in, you definitely feel a change as the decor screams Mexican.  The bar region, where I sat during my visit, was nicely appointed.  Plenty of Mexican beers on tap for those who are so inclined.  The bar service outside the immediate stools facing the bar-tender was a tad bit slow, especially with regards to food.  Speaking of the food: it's good, but nothing to write-home about.  Just your standard gringo corn-flake chips with watery salsa.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were full of goodness, but didn't necessarily pack the desired punch that I was looking for.  Despite its shortcomings, having decent Mexican food at basement prices is a fantastic thing.  And for that, I'm grateful.",

It's authentic staff hardly speaks English, hardly shows up at your table, and is hardly complimentary in any way.  The food was terribly bland for a Mexican joint and the margaritas were a little mix heavy.  If you have never eaten authentic Mexican, then this place may be just tame enough for the shy.  I was really let down that they only had one dish with chorizo and I didn't see nor taste a bit of cilantro on anything.  I'm not sure if they're lack of effort is due to the fact that Pittsburgh does not have a very heavy Mexican culture or I'm still caught up of having the excellent service and food from my old neighborhood in Chicago, but I won't be returning here.",

    "text": "This is the real deal IF you like authentic mexican food.  Now, if you are part of the taco bell army (of which I have been known to be a soldier) you are in for something very different when you enter \"El Camp\".  I've recommended this place to many a friend only to hear how disappointed they were with the food.  This is a normal response if you are used to eating a Bacon Club Chalupa and considering it Mexican gourmet.  If you like authentic Mexican or want to try authentic Mexican I've been told by many \"authentic mexicans\" this is the place to go.  This review is for the Monroeville location, located beautifully next to a paper mart and another strip mall staple (your token chinese joint), however between these two common stores lies a delicious oasis of Mole sauce and Poblanos.  They have multiple locations all over the city, but I believe this is the original.  The other locations are a bit more upscale with a bar and happy hour scene.  I go here about once a month or so usually with staff.  The meal starts with their delicious home made chips and salsa.  They have a couple varieties for those of us who like spicier foods.  Some of the more adventorous dishes I've tried were \"Chile Poblanos, Two whole poblano peppers stuffed with white Mexican cheese, topped with egg white, rice, refried beans, three tortillas (corn or flour) and ranchero sauce on top.\" and \"Mole Ranchero, Brown sauce made with Mexican spices with shredded chicken, served with rice and choice of guacamole salad or tossed salad.\".  Both were delicious and unfortunately not having tried these at other spots don't have the background to compare.  I can tell you they tasted great and the portions were good.  I usually stick to the more basic offerings such as fagitas, tacos, and burritos.  They are always cooked perfectly with a generous portion of meats and cheeses and plenty of mexican condiments.  I suggest going to this place multiple times and hopefully being a litte more adventorous than me.",

So with the right approach - i.e. don't go buck-wild ordering the enchiladas de mole and expect Rick Bayless to magically appear on your plate  - this isn't a bad option.  Just relax with a Dos Equis, some nacho cheese over a burrito, and a couple of churros and everything will be ok.",

Next I got a combination dinner and asked for a chile relleno. He asked if I had ever had them there and then explained the relleno and the poblano and how they make them. Best choice to change to the chile poblano. My boyfriend got a burrito and quesadilla. He said they were both very good. We ordered cheese dip (queso) at the beginning. It was a little spicer than most places I have had it. There was a lot of it and it was really good. The portion sizes were huge. I took home half of my dinner.

    "text": "Upfront: I'm a total jerk about Mexican food, in spite of the fact that I've never lived in Mexico, or even CA or AZ or really anywhere that gives me any cred at all. That said, my idea of decent gringo-ized Mexican food was formed in areas with large Mexican populations, and maybe Christmas tamales from kitchen coworkers.  As much as I love Pittsburgh, we've got a serious shortage of edible Mexican/Mexamerican/Tex-Mex going on. El Campesino is decent, and probably one of the better options if you're looking for fajitas or a combo plate in the Steel City.  For starters, they have the ubiquitous chips and salsa; the chips are almost always fresh, and the salsa's decent though made with canned tomatoes every time I've gone, even in late summer. Not a lot of kick, but at least there's cilantro involved.  Queso dip is OK, too, and yes -- it's white cheese, heaven forfend, so not quite the same as Velveeta + salsa in the crockpot or Chi-Chi's queso.  Their mole is decent. Nothing to write home about, but good for a fix if you don't feel like spending twelve hours with your stock pot and blender.  Enchiladas are also decent, as are the burritos, fajitas, etc. The refritos are fairly generic, and as far as I'm concerned the rice isn't worth eating, but I might be picky.  Chile verde is probably the best thing I've eaten there; tart, savory, pork-fatty and corn tortillas? Yes, please.  Guacamole is pretty seriously meh; it tastes a bit like citric acid and nothing at all like someone smashed it up fresh in the back. Still, it's avocado, and with the Iggle charging 2.50 per for Haas, it'll do.  They do have horchata if you ask, which scores a lot of bonus points in my book. I just wish the flour tortillas didn't taste like they came from a plastic bag. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I think on the whole that the bar for Mexican, \"Mexican,\" whatever, is pretty low in the 'burgh. So clearing said bar by a good margin doesn't mean a whole lot, right? Then again, it's unfair of me to wish it were a 24-hour taqueria.  Service is fast and friendly. The atmosphere (on McKnight) is standard for this type of Mexican restaurant: A bit dark, lots of booths, reasonably quiet until someone has too much tequila.",

The service was great, polite waiters and things were served timely.  The waiter also kept my drink full, which is about all you half to do to make me happy!  They do provide chips and salsa as soon as you sit down.  For me, this was the best part of the meal.  They have great salsa and the chips are light and crunchy!  I got 2 enchiladas and a taco.  They were all beef and there was no spice to the beef at all.  It tasted just like fried ground meat.  I could have made them better at home.  I realize that not all Mexican food is meant to be spicy but it should have some type of flavor to it.  My meal came with rice which was pretty good.  The rice was soft but not chewy!  The price is pretty good as well, $8 for lunch.  If you want a quick edible meal this is the place.  i probably will not go back anytime soon.

    "text": "This was by far my favorite place to get Mexican in Robinson. The prices were dirt cheap and the service was always fast. The food was ALWAYS really good.  El Campesino has the best salsa I've ever had. Maybe it's just my preference, maybe I have no idea what a good salsa is but I absolutely love it. I disagree with the rice comments and think all of their food has always been consistent and delicious. I've been to El Campesino almost weekly for a while; I like Mexican food that much.  The chips are always warm, too, which is a simple gesture but makes all the difference. Honestly, the place is pretty gringo-friendly but it has its charm. You probably wouldn't find anything on their menu in a restaurant on the other side of the US nor would you find it south of the border but you get what you can out of Pittsburgh...",

The enchilada sauce was bland and the enchilada had little filling. The tostada was stale and didn't come with sour cream. The rice was also bland and their was about a half pound of it.   As an aside, i think I've been in cleaner restrooms at gas stations. Ugh, foul.   I won't be going back. I went home and ate cereal.",

    "text": "Upon hearing how awful Mexican food is in Pittsburgh, a coworker suggested this place to me. Since its on the exact other side of the city than me, I usually assumed that I'd never check this place out (and that he was probably wrong to begin with).  Well, we were up on the North Side and decided to go a little further north. We checked this place out and, to be honest with you, I was happy that I was wrong. This place is pretty good, at least from what we sampled.  The food was great. The decor was pretty cool. They have a couple chairs with Frida's head on them. Our only complaint was the table they sat us at. It was about six feet from the kitchen, kinda just out in the open. Whenever the front door would open, we'd get a blast of cold air. Plus the table was wobbly. I don't want to sound like I'm finding fault, but there were like three other tables taken, they could have given us plenty of tables other than that one.  We ordered 2 lunch platters and an extra side of rice. Altogether, we got a quesadilla, a tostada, a burrito, a tamale and an enchilada. Everything was pretty tasty. My only gripe on the food was they poured enchilada sauce on the burrito. While it didn't ruin it for me, it would have been nice to say so on the menu.  Both the enchilada and burrito were made with ground beef. Again, it didn't ruin it for me, but it would be nice to know on the menu. The quesadilla and the enchilada were both stuffed with cheese. I won't lie, but the quesadilla was the best I've had in Pennsylvania, barring my own kitchen. Creamy cheese, a nice little crust on the bottom, it was perfect.  The chips and salsa were the friggan bomb. Honestly, I could have drank the salsa. And to be honest, I literally did (just so I could say I did it). Its a medium-consistancy tomato paste. It has a bite to it. A nice little bite. I personally like spicy, my girlfriend does not. I loved the salsa and she didn't really have any. I do think they should have a mild salsa....just in case people don't like hot ones.  Finally, the real show stopper. The rice. Simple. Fluffy. Orange rice. Some lima beans and corn in it. Its amazing. I ate all the rice and the chips and salsa pretty much to myself and I let her eat the items. I did go nuts on the tamale, though.  All this for $18...which is about what I'd have paid at California Taco Shop. Its not authentic, but it doesn't always need to be. The food is good, tasty and affordable. The salsa and the rice were exellent. If this place wasn't so far out of the way for me, I'd go back again.",

    "text": "A solid 3 star \"A-OK\" Mexican restaurant. I was craving Mexican food after shopping at Robinson Mall, and the Yelp App led me right to El Campesino. Much like everything else on McKnight Rd, it's nestled in a strip mall, and has ample parking. The decor is pretty standard kitschy Mexican restaurant but nothing that turned me off. The service was helpful, prompt and attentive.   I ordered the Hornitos 16oz margarita ($9), and the carnitas dinner ($14). The margarita was tasty: perfect amount of tequila so you don't feel ripped off, and you could tell it wasn't made from bottled margarita mix. The carnitas dinner came with rice, beans, guacamole salad, and tender pork chunks with grilled onions. For me, the carnitas could have been more strongly seasoned and the beans were a little too thick, but the guac had a nice citrus brightness. I mean, it was good, but it didn't wow me. The chips seemed... not stale, but just not light and crispy and fresh. While I loathe chunky salsa, theirs was a little too runny (though the flavor was passable). I was left with the impression that they were maybe gringo-ing everything down a little too much.   Looked like they had some pretty decent drink specials for happy hour and when Pittsburgh teams are playing. If I'm in the area, I would stop by again, but I won't be making a special trip from Sq Hill.  They accept AMEX.",

The waitress took his plate and when the manager came out, he proceeded to lecture my friend that he wasn't used to corn tortillas and sometimes they can have hard bits. Once we insisted that no, we understand what corn tortillas are and that was not at all the issue, he put in an order for a different dish for my friend and then came back out and apologized because at that point he had actually looked at the plate and saw what we were referring to. Generally we're both really forgiving if something happens with the plate of food as long as it is handled courteously, and we're not argumentative, we just want to enjoy our dinner, so we were a bit irritated to get an unnecessary lecture as part of our dining experience. This was on top of the food being not that great, and rather expensive for what it is. I really love Mexican food, and found my plate to be not very flavorful. I would not recommend it.",

    "text": "Went to this place with my wife and friend for the first time. We got seated right away and before I even had my jacket off a guy brought over fresh tortilla chips and some amazing salsa. Sadly, that's as good as our night got. We waited roughly 15 minutes before the waitress came to take our drink orders and then another 15 minutes before she took our food orders. By this time we were out of Chips so I asked for more chips and salsa. She came back 15 minutes later with chips only so we waited approximately 40 minutes to get our food as we sat there and watched the table next to us receive and finish their meals before we got ours even though they arrived 10-15 minutes after us. We asked for salsa at this time as well.  Finally the meal itself was nothing to brag about. Not bad, but not really good either. My wife got the California burrito which had tomatoes even though she asked for no tomato. My friend got the chicken quesadilla which was very small and didn't even come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream or salsa and I got the enchiladas super rancheras It was supposed to be 1 cheese, 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 shredded beef, and 1 other kind of enchilada. I only received 3 of them but instead of complaining I just ate it instead of having to wait another 30 minutes for a new dish.   We did ask to speak to a manager and we were told there was no manager so the shift leader came over and we explained how long we had to wait in which she took off 50 percent. We never had our drinks refilled either until the very end when we had to ask.   Overall, the chips and salsa were great, the food was so/so , but the service was atrocious. We got there at 6:00 and were there well after 8. We were an abandoned table just sitting there and the orders were prepared with little effort and incorrectly. We will probably go back and give it another chance maybe for lunch, but it was just a really bad experience tonight. If you go here I recommend going around 4 or for lunch and to be very specific as to what you are ordering.",

The decor suggests the familar decent but not great fare you typically find at such eateries.  El Campesino is in a word: garbage.  The salsa is watered down tomato sauce with an piece of chopped onion or two. Everything we had off the menu was just unappetizing. We eneded up leaving most of our food uneaten and finished up at Taco Bell.  Bland, bland, bland. Nothing had flavor. Nor the salsa. Not the Chimichunga. Not the Carnitas. I don't think I've ever found carnitas that I was willing to leave behind sitting on a plate.  No one should ever go here. This place takes like Chi-Chis from 1988.

You get one each of ground beef, shredded beef, shredded chicken, cheese, and bean enchiladas. Yum!  These are best eaten w/ either a house margarita on the rocks (they use Hornitos Tequila which is just okay or you can \"buy up\" to premium Tequilas) or a frosted mug filled w/ amber Dos Equis draft beer.  Their food is not very fancy nor spicy - it's very plain homestyle Mexican. Their salsa is good but a little on the bland side - it could use more layers of flavor.   The most disappointing thing was the STRONG disinfectant smell wafting past our table situated near the foyer/lavatories. Blech! Hate that!

The service here for awhile was really slow if sitting at the tables in the bar area, depending on who your server is. Sitting at the actual bar, things always seemed to move much faster. They have a decent beer selection, better liquor selection, and reasonable prices. Actually, their prices in general are quite low. Our last visit saw us order 3 plates of food, chips & salsa, one beer, and two sangrias for under $30 (sangrias were a tad pricey at $7.50 apiece).  We always seem to be in here when there's a game going on and they definitely have a good setup in the bar area for watching. The decor in this place also cracks me. Sort of feed the stereotypes, if you know what I mean, but it's all tongue-in-cheek, good humor.  The one thing I always get is a side order chicken enchilada. Always. Doesn't matter what else I'm ordering. I love that thing, yummy. The tostadas are ok, burritos and tamales are pretty good, tacos are bad (stay away from those).   If you're in the North Hills area and looking for something quick, cheap, but still pretty good to eat, I recommend this over something like Applebee's.",

When I got my tacos the meat was poorly seasoned and bland....and it's MEXICAN food, don't be afraid to use some flavor in it.     In fact the Qdoba and Chipolte up the street are even better as fast food options for Mexican.          The Emiliano's up the street is no longer open at the McKnight location but their other locations are also fantastic.",

The food tasted old, decrepit, and mundane.   The crappy Mexican music they play in the background of every Mexican restaurant kept skipping, and skipping, and skipping, over and over again. If this wasn't the seventh layer of hell, I don't know what was.  I couldn't wait to get out of there as soon as I sat down. The booths are so uncomfortable, my back hurts just thinking about sitting in that awkward, wooden bench.  Our server never ever showed up to see how our food was. He didn't suggest anything, he just took our order, disappeared, then brought out our food. Our food was served to us probably 5 minutes after we ordered it. How is food supposed to be fresh if it doesn't take longer than 5 minutes for the order to go in and the food to come out?  I will NEVER go back.",

If, however, your idea of Mexican food is a cheesy enchilada, a large margarita and possibly french fries, well, then this is right up your alley.

The prices are a little steep for what it is and the offerings are your typical very Americanized fare with a Mexican twist.

The bill came without any HH discounts - once we inquired the manager advised that the \"large\" drinks we ordered had not qualified for HH pricing - we asked for the manager to review and were offered no concession for an error that was obviously not ours. What a shame that the manager wouldn't/couldn't correct a pretty easy situation to resolve. Can't say I would be back anytime soon. Positive note I hear the place next door STOKES is awesome!

    "text": "Wow, I was thoroughly unimpressed with El Campesino. I'm honestly surprised that Mexican food could be so bland.   Our visit started with my husband and I waiting for about five minutes for someone to come to the hostess stand to seat us. We were the only people waiting & there were about 15 tables open.   Once we were seated our waitress was quick to come over & take our drink order. She was back in a flash and expected us to be ready to order, but we were not. When she came back to take our dinner order we also ordered a half order of queso to go with our tortilla chips.  After about ten minutes our dinners came out. I was impressed but how quick they were to bring out our dinners. My dinner was so bland and I was so disappointed. I had to salt my enchilada & tostada for any flavor. I kept adding salsa to my food to add some spice. I ate half my dinner and called it quits because it was so blah. I kept hoping our queso would come out l, so I could possibly add some flavor to my meal. It never came out. When we asked about it when we got our check our waitress said oh yeah, it's sitting in the microwave do you still want it to go? The waitress seemed taken aback that we wanted it removed from our check. Seriously? We never got it!?!?! Why would we pay for it??? Why would I want cheese that's microwaved?   Save yourself from a bland, boring meal and go to Emiliano's, Patron's, Chipotle, Moe's, Qdoba or heck even Taco Bell.",

I called several times & no resolution was offered. I'm just outta luck. So save yourself the aggravation & don't even go there if you don't want the hassle. They didn't even credit the incorrect amount that I was charged. I had to do it all through my bank. I will never patronize this restaurant again.",

I don't know if this is considered authentic Mexican but it is always delicious.  The margaritas are the best and their salsa goes perfectly with the fresh chips.  The staff is wonderful and attentive.  Without being told it was a birthday celebration they surprised me with a song and the perfect little sundae on a honey sweetened tortilla.  This is a great place for a quick drink and appetizer or a leisurely dinner.",

    "text": "I love this place. Went on a Sunday with a party of 3. Music was jamming on the speakers and service was so prompt.   Parking is great because it's within a shopping strip. Ample parking for the restaurant.   The menu is pretty vast. When you sit down you get free chips and some deee lisshusss salsa. Order the queso dip. It's a great addition to the free chips and salsa. I wanted a cherry Pepsi but they didn't have that, but they were able to make it for me. The server added a bit of grenadine to my Pepsi and voila it was cherry flavored!  I also wanted a little alcoholic libation. The Sangria is strong!!! But good like I like it!   I ordered the enchiladas rancheras. Loved them. You get 5 different enchiladas with 2beef, 1 chicken,  1 cheese and one filled with beans. The bean and cheese were my favorite ones. My husband got the quesadilla fajita. It's his favorite dish there.   There's tons of space in the restaurant. Saw a couple of large parties. The only con about the place are the booths. The seats aren't that comfortable to me. The backs of the booth have very little give..so you have to sit either straight up or lean over your table a bit to be comfortable. Next time, I'll probably choose a table with chairs and not a booth. Overall, food and drinks were on point!",

Me: Do you have any beer specials? Waitress: Huh? Me: ... I'll have a Tecate. Waitress: A what? Our beer have weird names. ... Me: I'll have the Pastor taco special. Waitress: I don't think we have that. Me: It's on the chalkboard in the lobby. Waitress: I've never heard of it so I don't think we do.  The food is fine. I've not had a bad meal here, despite the 12oz Tecates costing $5.50 which is absurd. However, this is one of many bad service experiences I've had.",

    "text": "This was my first time at this El Campesino location. We stopped in here for dinner on Saturday night since we were out shopping. We got there around 8 pm and were seated right away. The bar area seemed pretty packed, but the dining room area(where we sat) had some openings. We were greeted by our waitress right as we sat down. We ordered our drinks and another man came out with chips and salsa right after that. When our waitress came back she asked if we were ready to order. We placed an order for the queso, but told her we needed more time to look over the menu. She literally came back out with the queso a minute later and asked if we were ready to order. We still needed more time so we said so. She came back two more times very quickly and finally on her next time around, we were ready to order. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and i got the chicken fajita salad. Our food was out in less than 10 minutes and everything was very hot and fresh. Our food was very good- great flavor and portion sizes.   I gave El Camp four stars because the food was very food and our waitress gave us extra chips for free even though the menu says there would be a charge. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because our waitress was very pushy. I really appreciate great service, but it was to the point where i couldn't look over the menu because i kept getting interrupted to see if i was ready to order yet.   We didn't order dessert, but a table across from us did and it looked amazing. I'll have to go back to try desserts next time!",

One thing I didn't like - maybe others do - but the service was way too fast. Asked 3 times if we were ready to order just after sitting down - with an extensive menu, no, we need a little time. Food was out quick, but then so was the waiter to check, ask if we needed boxes and then the check. All in all felt rushed and there were many open tables still open.",

Overall I have had better so if you have high expectations I would not recommend.  Pros: pleasant staff. Accommodating when hubby did not like his food....Enchiladas de Mole and reordered shrimp tacos. Tortillas chips were nice and hot. Salsa flavorful.  Great atmosphere  Cons: No substitutions  No black beans Ordered Cinco de Mayo dinner. Beef tough, chicken dry Rice plain. No corn or onions or anything cooked with it. Shrimp tacos: tiny cheap shrimp. Didn't taste fresh to me. Hubby ate them. Margarita on rocks only and beer as special drink price .  This place has a great Mexican feel. Food quality is low. Food edible but nothing to brag about. I didn't take any food to go, although hubby did. Food felt generic. It would be ok if your hungry.",

    "text": "Great place and location. Food is not bad but I wouldn't exactly serenade for it. I know we're a long way from the culture and cuisine but the price is way too steep and you'd understand if you've tried any Mexican food from anywhere in the Southwest region.  Campesino means 'peasant farmer' and the dishes in my opinion should be as simple and flavorful as peasants in any culture use the simplest of ingredients to create flavorful art. Most of the dishes on the menu are quite the opposite of this.  We dined here twice at the bar area and both times the service was not great, overwhelming it seems for the staff, that can't remember to look over and see how you're doing, forgetting anything you've ordered from the a la carte menu or remember the check after you've asked for it. We were left irritated at times observing the staff finding time to chat up with regular customers long enough for us to know the entire story while waiting for a refill on our drinks.  The first time there we sat at the bar because we're 'adults' and a family with three young children disrupted the bar environment and were paid more attention because they knew the owner and staff. I ordered the Chile Verde and it was way too salty the veggie fajitas were ok but we were brought flour tortillas instead of the corn tortillas requested. Waitstaff never returned so we gave up trying to get it corrected.  The second time we sat down our drinks were not filled immediately because the staff decided to chat with the new table that came in for what seemed like forever. I ordered fajitas because it came in a cast iron-skillet, usually means its going to be sizzling from their kitchen to your table, were disappointingly, not very hot at all and we're 'marinated' and kind of dry, which means they were not fresh and the onions and peppers were plated a little early. The other plate was a shrimp quesadilla which was great except that it came before the other dish, so we dined more or less separately waiting for drinks in between.  The atmosphere could also use some music, as you can hear everyone's conversations even from the main dining area. The drink ware is not frosted, so your beer gets a little warm pretty fast, especially in a 22 Oz. mug.  The likelihood of us returning is very slim as there are other choices to explore around the city.",

I got a combo with 2 enchiladas, a taco, and rice.  Their beef meat is bland, the red sauce they put on the enchiladas, bland.  The rice was ok tasting, BUT for some reason that is beyond my comprehension, they put vegetables in the rice.  Did they get a chef that formerly worked at a Chinese restaurant?  And another BUT, the vegetables they put in the rice must have been from a can of mixed vegetables.  It was corn, carrots, peas, and LIMA BEANS!  Seriously!  Who the heck wants lima beans with their mexican food.  Not this guy.  Also, the prices were a bit higher than comparable Mexican places.  I'll give them a pass on this since the rent on Mcknight road is a little more pricey than other areas, so the food prices might need to reflect that.  But I definitely don't recommend this place, it's not like there's not hundreds of other better Mexican places in Pittsburgh.",
