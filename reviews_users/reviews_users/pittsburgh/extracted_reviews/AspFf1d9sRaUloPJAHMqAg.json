Went into sushi Kim thinking I would only order sushi, but my friend told me to order from their main menu. The short ribs are to die for! Plus they have homemade kimchi which was very tasteful. I came to this place about 5-7 times since I moved here. Love the Korean BBQ! GREAT SERVICE OVERALL! Prices are a bit to high but is worth every penny! DEFF COMING BACK!",

    "text": "A group of friends and I went to try out the Korean BBQ. Apparently that is only available on the weekends, so be warned. We started off a bit on the wrong foot, because we had made reservations in advance, only to be told when we got there that another, larger party had booked out the upstairs BBQ area, so they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. After staging a bit of a hissy fit, they were able to find a place for us, and the adventure commenced.  So, having had Korean BBQ in both New York and San Francisco, I can't say that I thought this was the best experience. The kim chi selection is pretty limited when you're used to being plied with multiple little plates of different kinds of tasty kim chi. Here, they only give you the pickled cabbage. If you're looking for vegetables, this is not your place. You can take marinated bulgolgi, kalbi, pork, and chicken, plus there's calamari and shrimp for seafood eaters. The chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. As one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from Trader Joe's is better than what we had here.  If you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. It's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though I'm not sounding like I had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves. But don't go thinking that you are going to have the culinary experience of your life.",

    "text": "My friends from North and South Carolina were craving for sushi so the seven of us decided to stop by Sushi Kim on our way to a business reception. This restaurant is Korean operated with a wide range of Korean and Japanese dishes to choose from. Although the location seemed desolate by the time we got there, the interior was spacious and festive with mini barbecue grills and bento boxes highly visible at every table. I was skeptical about the quality of either cuisine but in support of my friends I eventually chimed in with a 10-piece mixed nigiri with miso soup and mango sorbet for dessert ($41 w/tax and tip).   Among the nigiri sets, I thought the sake, ikura, and uni were decent but not fantastic or super fresh. The miso was too salty and the double scoops mango sorbet was generous but did not create a spark. With a versatile menu and spacious seating arrangements, this could be a decent place for large group gatherings. However, as someone who is spoiled rotten with fantastic Asian food from California, I thought the quality of sushi was rather bland for the price they were charging.  In short, this is how they measured up on a scale of 1-5 stars:  1.) Quality and freshness: 3 stars, everything was decent but the wow factor was missing. 2.) Creativity and presentation: 3 stars, the cuts of the fish were generous and nicely presented. 3.) Quantity and substance: 2.5 stars, the flavors were weak, unimpressive but passable. 4.) Accessibility and affordability: 2 stars, the price was very steep for the little amount of sushi I got. 5.) Service and ambiance: 4 stars, our server was unresponsive at times but the ambiance was clean and festive.  With some reluctance, 3 stars for the overall experience. I won't be coming back.",

Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice.   Maybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all.",

    "text": "Sushi Kim has long held a reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in town. However, after repeated visits, I wonder if this stems from the day when Sushi Kim was practically the only sushi restaurant in town.   Please note that this review pertains to the sushi dining only, for dinner. I've not been there for lunch or had the Korean food.  My most recent visit typifies each time I've had there. Upon arrival, the place is nearly empty. The service is attentive but indifferent, as if they realize you're a dirty dish that needs to be cleaned - you're taken care of like any other chore.  The miso soup arrived, and was very tasty. However, it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool. This is pretty normal, as well.   The most disappointing part is the sushi itself. It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar. Each and every variety is equally disappointing, with the end result being \"Meh\" to \"Yech.\"   With such a large population of sushi places in Pittsburgh these days, and even Giant Eagle in a pinch, there is not really a reason to frequent this place anymore. After a handful of visits based on reputation and the hope that this time might be better, I've made my last trip to Sushi Kim.",

I have been on a no fish kick, so usually get some vegetarian options and sometimes an extra specialty roll for the bf. Their simple rolls are nicely done - the avocado roll has big, healthy chunks of avocado (my fave) and is tightly rolled. I also love the tofu roll. Also, these are big rolls (8 pieces I think) so one could pretty much fill me up.  My order is usually ready in 15 minutes and the service is friendly. I've eaten in several times as well, sitting at the sushi bar is the best spot, in my opinion. The owners/staff are very friendly, and they have good sushi!",

FOOD: We always order the hae mul pa jun (seafood pancake) for starters. I really like this dish since it's full of seafood and chewy in texture. Then I always get the sushi 12 pc. combo, which is an array of salmon, tuna, yellow tail, clam, shrimp, and octopus. I love their sushi rice which is a bit sweet. I usually order their bi bim bap (mixed vegetables with rice) which is always good. I also got their dae goo mah one tang (spicy fish soup) which was full of fish and tofu.

    "text": "This place sucks, and I have no idea why it's on a list of Pittsburgh's best sushi restaurants (unless the sushi here really is just that bad). I guess my first mistake was probably going to a Korean place for sushi, but whatever. The service was poor, and the food was just gross. I asked for sea salt for my edamame bc it wasn't salted at all, and the waiter handed me the salt shaker that was on the table. It hadn't been used in so long that the salt was cemented together. I ate two over-priced rolls--the tempura roll with crab and shrimp and the vegetable maki roll. The tempura roll was just tempura rolled in rice and topped with roe. No sauce, no other fillers to give it taste. It was rolled poorly and fell apart in soy sauce. The veg maki didn't taste like much, either, and some pieces were too big to eat properly. Overall, this place was really sad and disappointing. Hopefully their Korean offerings are better.",

Then after my meal she was apologetic about the wait and service, of which I really had no criticisms to offer. I found the interior to be very decorative.  I've come across the other reviews that seem to be more directed at the Sushi and during non-busy hours. I went late Saturday evening and it was very busy. Also, the price was reasonable. In regards to the food my only gripe was that the ground meat seemed cold, but the rest of the meal was delicious.   In all honesty given the overall experience, I am being borderline nit-picky to dock a whole star from the rating. Regardless, the food was very good and the service excellent.",

    "text": "I didn't have the awful experience some had here based on prior reviews, but it was definitely mediocre.  I went on a Wednesday evening and the place was totally dead except maybe one couple sitting by the sushi bar part of the time I was there.  Which is sad because they have such a huge space with 2 levels, lots of seating, and great proximity to both the Strip and downtown.  A lot more could be done with this place.    The menu was printed in very poor quality with what could have been nice pictures of food options but they were super fuzzy and hard to see.  It seemed like their Korean menu was pretty varied but I had come for the sushi.  I ordered the Kim's Favorite Roll which was described as \"Tuna, Yellowtail, Broiled Eel, and Salmon\"  but what I wasn't expecting was the salmon to be cooked all the way through.  Maybe I  should have read it as \"broiled eel and salmon\" but that wasn't clear or typical of this sort of roll.  Normally eel is cooked but the other fish are raw unless specified otherwise.  Maybe you'd have a fried roll or something baked or seared on the top, but to cook one type of fish that is normally raw and mix it inside with 2 raw types just seems strange to me.  So it ended up being a really odd combination with the raw tuna and yellowtail next to the cooked sushi which wasn't so great all squished together inside the roll.  The sushi roll was quite large at 16 pieces, but I still felt that 18.95 was really pricey considering the quality of the fish was only mediocre with small portions, and they used a TON of rice. The quality of the fish was again just ok.  Not super fresh but not bad either.  The rolls (and those of my friends) kept falling apart as we tried to eat them.  It seemed they weren't properly wrapped or maybe it was just that they tried to use way too much rice.  One fun thing was that all the rolls came out on little boats, so that was a nice touch.  The roll also came with a miso soup, which was fine but nothing special.  The miso soup didn't have the awful taste some others here reported but it tasted like what I'd make from a powered package rather than made fresh.  I also got the shrimp shumai which were again just ok, and tasted like what I could get from the freezer section of an asian store and microwave myself rather than made fresh.    One person at our table got a Korean dish which came with 4 side dishes that were all vegetable except for the fish cakes.  She said her food tasted decent but the beef bul go gi dish she got just didn't look right or have the proper color it should have had.  Just liked kind of dry and plain.  When I went to the restroom I was disturbed to see trays of the Korean side dishes in the hallway just sitting out in the open not covered or anything!  It would be different if the restaurant were bustling but it was totally dead and pretty clear those wouldn't be eaten that evening (so I shudder to think that after hours sitting out uncovered unrefrigerated that they put them out again the next day and hoped someone would eat them...).  If you aren't that busy there is no reason things can't be prepared to order!  That is simply lazy.  Also I overheard part of a conversation between a waiter and a guy at the sushi bar about something being \"expired\" and what to do about that.  Unfortunately I couldn't hear all the details but it was disturbing since this was after we all had gotten our food already.  I mean it's good they are being mindful of expiration dates but it sounded like someone had to be schooled on it based on what I heard.  But granted that I only heard bits and pieces so I can't say for sure.  I don't think I'll go back here again.",

On the one hand, I should probably be more gentle considering that Pittsburgh doesn't have any other Korean bbq places, but on the other hand, it's hard for me to be nice coming from the SF bay area.  At $22 a person, the buffet is a bit more expensive than you'd usually find in a Korean bbq place. To be fair, most dishes at Korea Garden in Oakland are even higher priced. Unfortunately, I felt that the quality left a lot to be desired. The bulgogi was overall too salty for my tastes, while the galbi lacked any taste at all. In addition to spicy chicken, pork, and some seafood, this was all the meat that was available. And while they offered a good selection of vegetables, they did not offer panchan. I didn't think the limited selection was worth the price.   On the bright side, their service is pretty excellent. The Korean manager is extremely friendly, and he is willing to help if you are newcomers to doing Korean bbq.",

The rolls were disappointing, however; while the amount of fish was good, as noted by another reviewer, we both thought that the taste was bland and there were very few veggies in the rolls. As we strolled in the Strip later, we realized that Andy's Sushi at Wholey's was open on Sunday and, based on past experience, I think we would have been much more satisifed with the food there.",

    "text": "I had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to Sushi Kim. I have always heard how great this place was and the patron is immediately greeted by photos and plaque cards of the restaurant's accomplishments.   I was greeted by a non-Asian male, who was very seemingly very timid and shy. After a first glance, I noticed that some of my favorite Korean foods were no where to be found. I inquired with this male as to whether or not there was an alternative menu or whether these very common Korean dishes could be made. He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. He looked at the sushi menu and just told me to order what he thought was the closest thing.    Korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table. We had a different server cook my bulgogi. Another non-asian male who basically refused to speak with us. I could tell English was his second language, but he was extremely unpardonable. We sat in awkward silence because of his presence while cooking.   The Korean fried dumplings were very delicious, I will say that!   I will give Sushi Kim another chance because I know others rave about it.",

    "text": "Now that the weather has warmed up a bit, I don't mind venturing more than a few blocks from the office for lunch. Since today is my birthday, I thought I'd treat myself to something I haven't had in a long time, bulgogi.   I was greeted by a tiny Asian woman as soon as I walked in the door. \"Only one?\" as if I should be ashamed of being a solo diner. She wanted to seat me at a table in the front but, noticing an identical table in the back, I requested that one.  For some reason she didn't want me to sit there and lead me instead to a side room adjacent the bar as if to hide me.   The server came by shortly afterwards, with a menu and a glass of water. Although I had already made up my mind to get bulgogi before I even got here, I did take a moment to take a look at the menu and was almost tempted to get the kalbi instead. But stuck with the bulgogi when it came time to place my order.  About 15 minutes later the server brought me a bowl of soup politely confessing that he almost forgot about me. I suppose the hiding of me was a success. The soup was a salty broth with a few slices of scallion floating on top. Not much to my liking, but hey, everyone's taste is different right?  I'll admit that at this point I was starting to regret my decision to dine here for lunch in the first place but that attitude changed in about five minutes when my plate arrived.   The plate was divided into four sections. If you look at the photo that I took of it, I'll go clockwise from the top left. The salad was scrumptious containing red pepper slices, carrot slices, cucumber slices, and a slice of orange on top of a bed of lettuce. Everything was very fresh and there was something that resembled candy coated seeds sprinkled on top. This was all dressed with a delicately sweet dressing. Yum!  In the second quadrant was some of the best kimchee I've ever tasted. The fieriness of it was perfectly balanced off with cooked, yet purposely chilled, broccoli alongside two pillows of something doughy.  Below that was the main attraction; the bulgogi. I suppose I can talk with some authority here beings that I spent two years in the Republic of Korea. Granted that was about twenty five years ago but I can still detect an imposter when it comes to bulgogi. This is some of the most authentic bulgogi I've ever tasted. Masitneun!   Of course bulgogi and kimchee just wouldn't be complete without a generous serving of sticky rice. The kind of rice that you can easily pick up with chop sticks.  The total came to $10.65 which I consider a bargain for the quality of the meal that I had. Ms. Personality, the one who originally greeted me, took my check and credit card and rang me up. She didn't bother to look at me when in a halfhearted tone said, \"Thank you\".  Despite the \"hostess with the leastess\", I'm giving this place a four star based Seoul-ly on its authenticity and down-right deliciousness.  kamsahamnida",

It was pretty empty (around 2pm on a Sunday and we were the only ones there) considering what a large restaurant they have. The banchan was okay - nothing too special - but the rice and kimchi were both good. I got the kimchi jigae and it was perfect - hot, tasty, lots of tofu and pork, and the kimchi of course was great. I couldn't stop drinking the soup. I will say they were missing quite a few standard dishes (my Korean friend asked if they had certain dishes and they didn't), but I'm not familiar with this restaurant so I can't say too much with that.  We didn't try any sushi, but the menu looked good. They also have all you can eat Korean BBQ on the weekends for lunch.",

    "text": "Kay and I made a return visit  to Sushi Kim not long ago, and I must say that my 4 star rating has not wavered. I continue to find their food to be solidly appetizing.   The Pork Bulgogi is a scrumptiously smoldering heap of marinated pig and vegetables, its warm spice gently nibbling at your tongue, its sesame seed garnish adding welcome but slight crunchy textures.   Considering our boredom with sushi, we opted for the shumai as our appetizer. 6 quivering corks of steamed potsticker dough contained within them chopped shrimp. While flavorsome enough plain, the filling lacked seasoning, thereby giving purpose to the glass bottles of Asian condiments on our table.   Service-wise, there were no faux pas made.   Is the bulb in my noggin dim...for being favorable towards Sushi Kim?   Eh, who cares what you think?   I kid They Who Rant And Whine For The Sake Of It.   P.S. As I mentioned in my initial review, I thought their sushi was merely adequate in spite of their namesake (misnomer?). Stick with SK's hot Korean selections, and your meal may prove more enjoyable.",

His only complaint was that the portion was a bit small.  Cons: The side dishes were pretty sad/bland/not fresh.

Even though it's pretty easy to figure out once you messed with it, I definitely appreciated it. It's a little pricey for me because I can't eat as much as everyone else at $25 a person but everything tastes so great that I keep coming back with groups of friends. Highly recommend it for groups of people! So far everyone who visits from out of town loves it too!",

The gentleman helping us told us to make sure you get a lot of the juice/marinade, which we ended up using when we were cooking. The only downside was that there wasn't much banchan. Some of the Korean restaurants I've gone to usually have the little plates of bean sprouts, rice paper wrapper, beef soup, seaweed, or salad.  They had fresh lettuce on the side, at least. I still felt like I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant though since we filled up on the meats. And I'd come back whenever I'm in Pittsburgh again.",

That excitement didn't last for too long when I entered the place on a Monday evening at 7pm, realizing that I was the only one in a rather spacious restaurant.  Fine, I had a Sushi craving and couldn't care less. Until the Sushi arrived. I ordered my Spicy Tuna and Salmon rolls, both came within 2 minutes. Strange? Maybe, or just a super fast chef. Sadly, the rolls were falling apart as soon as I looked at them, and the Salmon even tasted... bad. I had to leave it on the plate, which has never happened to me before.  On the plus side, the miso soup was okay and the service was very attentive, which is not surprising if you're the only one in that place. As there are not too many Korean options in Pittsburgh I encourage you to try the Korean BBQ, especially as the reviews for the Korean food at Kim's on Yelp are not that bad. But for the Sushi - forget it.",

For the BBQ, it is expensive but at least you could try to eat ~$22 worth of meat and kimchi. They do ask you not to waste meat, which makes sense. I really like the kimchi and pickled daikon radishes they have on the side. To grill they have galbi, bulgolgi pork, spicy chicken, regular beef and pork, squid, shrimp, and mushrooms. You can also make your own sauces and add garlic and onion to the meat.  I would not recommend coming here for the regular food. The food is good, but the portion sizes are ridiculously small, especially for the high prices. Their bibimbap doesn't even come with rice.",

The venue is by no means impressive.  The decor is very dated and dark.  Whatever you do, do not drink the water.  My friend claims that it made him sick to his stomach.  Pittsburgh is not well known for its tap water.  I'm going to take a water bottle with me the next time I go.  The first time, I went a friend and I had the kalbi and the mandu.  It was palpable, but nothing special.  I've heard that the kalbi is one of the better things on the meal, but I personally don't like eating with my hands.  The second time, another friend of mine introduced me to soondubu.  I got the vegetable only soondubu, while my friend got the regular soondubu.  Soondubu is a spicy tofu based soup.  Traditionally, it is served with vegetables and shellfish.  My friend was kinda disappointed with the regular, because it only had shrimp. For me, the vegetable soondubu hit the spot!  On a cold winter's day, this spicy soup was absolutely perfect!  Craving to go back again!  I've heard the BBQ dinner is very good!",

(Perhaps this is the best time to go) We both ordered from their lunch special menu; Sushi sampler & spicy pork BulGoGi & also an app of shrimp dumplings.  Was not a fan of the dumplings but our pork was delicious, tender and spicy and the sushi was a nice mix and fresh.  My friend ordered the green tea ice cream and my sample of it was quite tasty.  We each had a glass of wine and with tip got out of there at around $50.00.  Not bad.   Their menu is extensive and it may be hit or miss here depending on what you order.  I have always had a hit with their BulGoGi, Korean Pancake, Hot Pots and   sushi.  Their service was attentive, but again, we were there for a late lunch and the place was not packed.  All in all, the food was very tasty, service was good and price was respectable.",

Okay, the above average...though she hovered a bit, the waitress was attentive (very).  On the plus side that meant we got anything we wanted quickly.  On the minus side...there was a 'rushed' feel.  Like...please eat and get out.    The salmon I got was great.  As was the jap chae.  The bi bim bob (sic) was a bit on the bland side, and the rice didn't have that crunch but it was fine.  The gyoza was good.  The miso was good.  The kim chi was good.  I ordered bulgogi sushi, but didn't really consider the fact that it would be basically a beef roll.  That was disappointing, but it tasted \"fine\".    The place was more or less empty and the decor had a cobbled together slightly shabby feel.  The fountain at the front of the restaurant was as empty.  They seem to have accumulated various kitschy decorative items to line the half walls that separate the dining area from the bar, and they were a bit dusty, which lent itself to that air of protracted benign neglect.    Upstairs seemed empty (korean barbecue) but I didn't venture up to see.    When the waitresses weren't actively serving patrons, they hid behind bamboo and watched, which is actually moderately amusing when you consider it.  *you can't see me...i'm invisible!!*  If there's a next time, it will probably be just for sushi.  Maybe takeout.",

Even though it was all you can eat, there's only so much you can eat of bland meat, frozen seafood, and a selection of only! 5 banchan dishes. At about 30$ a person, it seems like a pretty cheap deal for all you can eat Korean bbq, which it is. I would rather recommend not going to the bbq section of the restaurant, or just spending your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "I've come to Sushi Kim multiple times for Kbbq, and once for a sit down meal.   Honestly, this is NOTHING compared to Kbbq in the Bay Area or LA. Sushi Kim was actually my first Kbbq experience, and I'm certainly glad that I now know what real Kbbq is like. Instead of ordering meat, you get to pile your plates high with meat buffet-style. The meat often gets stuck and burned onto the grill after a while, but they won't clean it out or switch out a new one for you. The meat juices will trickle down into the middle, so I recommend cooking your vegetables there so they have some flavor. Unfortunately... the sauce also gets burned easily onto the grill.   I didn't know what Galbi tasted like for the longest time because all the meat flavors just kind of meld together into one flavor because everything is slightly burned or mushed together. They quality of meat is also pretty low, but hey, its all you can eat right?  There are also options for vegetables and seafood, which is nice. They also give you the classic kimchi, daikon side dishes. You can mix your own sauces on the side.   There aren't many Kbbq places in Pittsburgh, so the all you can eat meat here is not a terrible deal. However, I recommend that you try a better kbbq place too so you know what it's really like...  The one time I had sit down meal here was pretty average. I think the food wasn't worth the price, so I probably will never be coming back for a normal meal again.",

    "text": "When I lived in New York, people talked about how Korean food was the perfect comfort food, and there was a lot of Korean BBQ places.  One of my friends lived in Korea for two years and was dying to try this place so we came here.  I think this is the only Korean BBQ in Pittsburgh.  It is $25 per person so while it is not cheap, it is a meat buffet.  I ate a lot of things that I'm not totally sure what these things were.  Everything tasted delicious.  The Bulgogi was super delicious, as was this chicken covered in some kind of spices.  I think I had more pork too, plus some circular thing that was most likely squid.  I loved all of the different spices and the meat was good.  So you seem to get a piece of lettuce, stick some rice and a piece of meat in, add some kimchi and call it a day.  Simple and yummy.  I wouldn't come here without someone who knows Korean food because you cook Korean BBQ by yourself at your table.  This part is actually fun, but it would be difficult if you didn't know what you were doing.  There were a few odd points.  The service was a little odd and rude, as the Korean BBQ is only served upstairs.  We sat down downstairs and were treated rudely by the server when we decided for BBQ.  The place was desolate on a Friday night for dinner so maybe he was just stressed that he lost the table.  Otherwise, the service was acceptable.    I also ended up with a stomach bug for five days following this meal.  The raw meat just sits out, which in hindsight concerned me.  So while everything tasted good at the time, the illness afterwards was not good and very painful.  Maybe this is why no one came on a Friday night for dinner?  Would I try it again?  Yes...the BBQ was really good.  I just would remain a bit cautious.",

    "text": "I cringed when I saw that their BBQ buffet price went up to $24/person, considering that I can go to a seafood buffet 10 minutes away for much less. Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm.   The service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef.   There were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended).   Overall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh. For being the only Korean BBQ buffet place in the area, it deserves a standing ovation. I had a great time at Sushi Kim and would gladly recommend the Korean BBQ buffet special. Buffet price was a bit high though, so crack open that piggy bank!",

The waiters walked us through our first time and were very friendly. They are attentive and make sure you are taken care. Also, the drinks are cheap. We got a bottle of wine for $16.00.

I heard they have some barbeque on their 2nd floor but it was not available on Sunday.  Also, I used Samsung pay here. Apparently, I was the first customer used Samsung pay at this restaurant. The staff didn't really think Samsung pay works there.  But as most of you already knows, Samsung pay works almost everywhere. And Samsung pay worked very nicely and smoothly. I will use Samsung pay again when I visit this restaurant again. :)",

    "text": "Update: just tried their all you can eat BBQ. It was very good! It was different than any other Korean BBQ we had before, it was like buffet style. Pick your own meat, they have the basics selections, shredded beef, beef loins, chicken, pork, mussels, claim and shrimp, I think they also have squid. All meat were nicely seasoned, but the shrimp were frozen when they put them out and some were still frozen when we put it on the grill. I would prefer them to defrost ahead of time. But I wasn't a deal breaker.  They have some other seasonings on the table that you can assemble at your own preference. Fewer vegetable options, but plenty of lattice. Our servers was nice, he changed our grill plate couple times.   I think it is a nice option for K-BBQ if you don't want do the work at home or wanting to try the do it your self type of BBQ.",

However, it took the waiter 20 minutes to get our waters, despite the restaurant being half empty. When we got our waters, we alerted the waiter that we were ready to order. Despite this, he didn't take our orders. More time passed, and we even flagged another waiter down and alerted him that we were ready to order. However, they still didn't take our orders. Finally, roughly 35 minutes into our visit, they came to take our orders.   When we said we wanted the 34 piece sushi (their menu listed the item as 34 pieces of sushi on one page, and 32 pieces of sushi on another page), we were told that it wasn't available. Nevertheless, we continued with our modified orders.   During this time, the waiter did not take our orders and instead told us that they would be right back. They never came back. After 45 minutes, we gave up and left.",

We were expecting an authentic Korean restaurant with good banchan and food, but it was just average. :(   We ordered Kimchi Jaeyuk (kimchi pork) and beef fried rice. They first give you miso soup as an appetizer, which wasn't too bad. They only had three banchan - odeng (fish cakes), kimchi, and kongnamul (bean sprouts). The kimchi was very sour (it was \"old\") and the odeng and kongnamul was very bland.  The kimchi jaeyuk came with a bowl of white rice and it was okay (it tasted a bit sugary).  The beef fried rice was less oily than the Chinese kind but again, pretty bland. They could have at least put some sesame oil. :/   If you're looking for real soothing, Korean, umma-cooked food, this probably isn't the place. The flavors are a bit compromised and bland.",

I also love how it's served in a stoneware dish that crisps the rice that's at the bottom of the bowl.    I love the sushi here too, very great quality and the sushi chef really knows what he's doing. Today I visited and there was fatty tuna on the menu. Yum!!",

They could have more choices for meats, and also more side choices. My one thing they didn't have is japchae.

After you're seated, they bring out your grill and bowls of rice, and then bring you over to the buffet area to explain all the choices of meats, vegetables, and sauces. I liked the chicken and the calamari the most. While it's not the best quality Korean BBQ by any means (the seafood is still frozen when you grab it from the buffet station), you get what you pay for. I do wish they had more banchan - they basically just had kimchi and a couple other selections.   As one of the only Korean BBQ options in Pittsburgh and probably the only AYCE one, I would definitely recommend coming here and will be back the next time I crave some Korean BBQ!",

First thing, this is a Korean BBQ restaurant ..... enough said... it is NOT a Sushi restaurant though they DO serve \"Sushi\".  During my two-night experience:  I have posted images of what I ordered so that you the reader have some idea.  1) Sushi smelled fishy... right there a huge red flag. At first taste, the Salmon tasted fishy and a touch slimy. Added a lot of Wasabi Incase it made me sick. It did not.  2) The Miso Soup tasted good and strong but was BARELY WARM!!!!  3) Chirashi had many very thing pieces. Some were fishy smelling. The Tuna pieces were filled with tendon and horribly cut. This Chef should not be calling himself a Sushi Chef. The Tuna pieces were Hard to chew. Extremely wrong!!! The squid smelled fishy and was slimy. The other types of fish in my plate seemed okay. My salmon had a piece of sharp BONE which my gums and Tong found before I swallow it. I reported it and the Chef (via the Waiter) supposedly apologized. Could not take the time to come to my table and do it him/her self of course. It as if the Chef does not give a damn or thinks that everyone that orders his Sushi is a novice eater. No respect for his trade. Should not have served me fish in that condition.   4) Unfiltered bottle of Sake was good and so was the canned Sapporo.  6) Other plates I had were okays. Surf clam seemed old and frozen for a long time.  7) I don't know how this is one of the best Sushi places in town..... I was not impressed. Freshness on the sushi was lacking.... again, shame on the Chef!!!  8) Their Korean BBQ plates were okay, not great and not bad.  9) Service as good and attentive.  10) place was welcoming and seemed clean.  If you want Sushi go to a Sushi restaurant. Don't bother trying here. If your taste buds and stomach don't care then go right ahead...perhaps they have a different Chef on busy nights... I hope!  Overall I would avoid this place for Sushi. Come for the Korean BBQ. You be the judge.",

Inside the small chicken, where sweet rice and other ingredients were expected,was still frozen (see pic). It seemed they cooked the chicken in advance, and froze up. It was not fully thawed. Bibimbob was also bad, rice was cold. But the worst part was their customer service. When we made complain about this, one old lady, surely the owner of the place since unless would have been fired a long time ago, took our complain as if nothing. She bluntly said Bbimbob was supposed to be served cold (which is bs, I'm Korean too), and if I wanted she would recook the soup. She had not said sorry, never, which supposed to be her first response for complain like this. Our beautiful spring day was completely ruined by this bigotry and rudeness.   Simple putting, do not go this place unless you want to be terribly treated while wasting your money for nothing. I rather go to McDonalds.",

You will find Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, White Fish, Eel and Fish Egg pieces here along with Fresh Ginger and Wasabi. Many of these pieces are made with a touch of Wasabi that is a perfect ratio for your enjoyment. Not too much at all.  The presentation is also excellent.  We also received a Broth Soup with a lot of flavor, an assortment of Kimchi, Salmon Pancakes, Bean Sprouts and Raw Broccoli Medley. I am not sure if this came with the Linch Special or the SojuI mention later. I also tried the Vegetable with Ginger Dressing Salad and while it isn't the best I've had, it is quite good and larger than a normal portion for $3.95. Lastly I ordered a bottle of Soju. Yes, please know that Soju is an entire bottle of 19.3% alcohol which I must say is delicious! It reminds me of a sweet vodka. Maybe vodka with a touch of Sprite. The point is, this is shareable! I thought I was getting a glass but what you will receive at your table is a bottle and a shot glass for $13.00.  I am not complaining but they don't make that very clear. A happy mistake as myself and guest enjoyed the bottle immensely!  For right around $30 this was a ton of food and drink for the price. Skip the alcohol and you have a very nice and affordable lunch. My new spot for Sushi!  I definitely want to check out the rest of their offerings!",

Pros:  -Friendly & attentive staffs (+1 star) -Great atmosphere -Self serving station (you grab your own meat!)   Cons:  -$35 (including tax & tip) per person. In LA we have $10 AYCE kbbq, at the price of $30 you can eat beef tongue, galbi short ribs, tofu soup, kobe beef, intestines, etc... -Only few selection of meat and they weren't well flavored. I was surprised there was no beef brisket which is the minimum requirement of any kbbq place. The meats were cut too thickly. (The chicken was my favorite because it was actually well seasoned)  -Grill is weird. The center piece of the grill has a hole in it where all the juicy and sauce collects into. Half the time it felt like we were eating hotpot boiled meat rather than kbbq. We were instructed to cook the beef in the center and everything else on the side. (Okay, maybe this was our fault with putting a lot of the juice in the middle, we switched our tactic in the 2nd half and cooked everything juiceless in the middle and it finally had that crisp but we had to change the grill frequently)  TLDR;  Too expensive for what you get. I would rather spend $30 on better quality non-AYCE kbbq. I would not come here again unless it was for a special occasional (ex: friend's birthday and they wanted to come here). Great service though!",

We have been here for the all-you-can-eat Korean bbq, we have visited the sushi bar and normal table service on other occasions, this time we sat at the normal tables on the first floor.   We were shocked, The service was terrible (they were not busy) and the food was about the worst Korean food I have ever had.  We had the Beef Bulgogi, Dol-Sot BiBimBap, and a bit of sushi.  The portions have shrunk substantially, the bulgogi came out cold and oily.  The rice in the BiBimBap had no crispy edge to it.  No lettuce was provided with the bulgogi until we asked for the 3rd time.  There were only two small sides provided with the Bulgogi, sprouts and kimchi.  If this had been our first visit we would never go back.  Has something changed here?  This used to be place where you could find an excellent Korean meal.  Perhaps this was a singular bad event but It was so poor I am not sure I would try again.   Also It might actually be time for the place to do a deep cleaning.  It's been a while.",

For $8.95 and a dollar more than the vegetable udon, I'm not complaining but it was not very spicy but the noodles were hot enough to burn my mouth!  Large, good for big groups.  Lunch service was okay, but not very attentive given how slow it was.  Anyhow, I'd like to go back for the BBQ or sushi and hopefully have a 4 star experience.",

    "text": "Sushi Kim is one of those Korean restaurants you'll find in most N. American cities that don't have a really big Korean population. They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food, which is probably a good move considering the American palate and their general unawareness of Korean cuisine outside of the major Korean enclaves. It's pretty obvious by their name, they aren't trying to hide the fact they are Korean.  I've been there for both Korean BBQ on the second floor and Korean food on the main floor.  I wouldn't trek all the way from CMU to have sushi there since sushi can be more easily had, but definitely for the Korean food. Some would disagree, but I have friends from Seoul who even think Sushi Kim has the best Korean food in Pittsburgh.(Granted we are speaking for Pittsburgh) It is pricier than Korea Garden, but the atmosphere is slightly more \"upscale.\"  They also have at least 3 brands of soju(Charm, Cheoeum cheo reom, and  Jinro Chamisul), which for Pittsburgh is quite exceptional even though I would only drink the Chamisul. They also have Korean noraebang, which you have to reserve in advance. However they only have Korean songs, so if you can't read Korean you're out of luck. They charge $30/hour. I'm not sure there is any other Korean noraebang in the city. I didn't try it, so I can't say what kind of selection they have for songs.  The BBQ is a great deal and though not the best I've ever had. It may be the only Korean BBQ grill place in the city. The staff is quite attentive and is pretty good about replacing the grills. I would prefer a different sahm-jang and more variety in the non-BBQ items in the buffet. The BBQ is great for groups and seats 4 people for each grill.",

Yes, I am slightly bias because I am Korean but its great food. It's def more on the pricey side I would say compared to most Korean places. I always order the fried pork dumplings and beef bolgolgi. It's obviously cheaper during lunch but I feel that the portions are rather small in the \"box\" your food comes in. I'm not impressed with their alcohol selection, they need more mixed drinks! I have never tried the sushi so can't comment on that. I do wish it was more of the traditional Korean BBQ. They bring a small cooker to your table and make it but still isn't the same. Nonetheless food is great, this place is def worth checking out.",

    "text": "Rating Downgrade.  Over the last year I have eaten here about 2 dozen times. Today will probably be the last. Why? Well for whatever reason, they feel that they need to squeeze more margin out of each customer. Probably a contributing factor is because the size of their restaurant is like an airplane hangar for a hamster cage. The portion size of the meat dish Spicy Chicken Bul-Go-Gi (which is the only thing I have eaten here each time) has been consistently becoming a smaller part of the plate. They attempt to mask this by adding a decorative lettuce leaf or adding more onions, but c'mon, we know what you are doing. Sometime over the last several weeks they have changed to a new bento-box style format where the rice, chicken, sides and a side salad is separated into compartments on the box. Sadly, the quantity of chicken was decreased yet again. So, taking a time machine from the beginning of 2010 to 2011 would likely show that the amount of chicken provided in the dish has dropped by half. At $10 + tip, it is already a steep price to pay for lunch. According to the CPI (series ID: APU0000706111), the price of chicken has remained nearly constant over the last 2 years. With half the chicken, they can probably squeeze out an extra 0.50-$1 per customer. But when they start losing customers because of this, their net gain is NEGATIVE! I have seen this time and time again, but why is it so hard for restaurants to understand this simple concept?  So not only do they lose my business, they lose the business that I bring in by bringing my co-workers to lunch. I am very sad that Korean food will no longer be a part of my daily lunches.",

My husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.  It was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls.   We had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.  We tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.",

    "text": "This place was okay.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful.  It's someplace that I'd go to again.  Every July, I find myself in Pittsburgh, and this is one of my favorites there.  The grill is a little weird and their idea of AYCE sushi and Korean BBQ is different from most that I've experienced.  The sushi itself was not really all that good in my opinion.  I mostly stuck to the Korean BBQ and that was fairly good.  The sauces were fairly flavorful.  The meat selection, while not huge, was adequate.  The two story setup was pretty neat and it was easy enough to find on the street based on the directions that the convention (AC) gave us.  I'd definitely go here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.",

    "text": "Overall, this was pretty good Korean style cuisine, and the sushi was fresh, well prepared and reasonably priced.  If we had been in town longer, the Good Doctor and I would have checked out the weekend Korean BBQ bar upstairs. We perused, and it looked pretty good - sort of a Mongolian Beef BBC concept, except Korean style.   The first night of our conference at the nearby convention center, we were surprised it wasn't more crowded, considering the close proximity. However, by the second day of our conference, our colleagues had caught on and filled up the restaurant.  We heartily recommend - there's not much else in that neighborhood, and Sushi Kim is filling the gap nicely.",

Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!",

It was super cute in there and the waiters were reserved, but nice. At first I thought that it was a little expensive for the Pittsburgh area, but after I got my rolls, I thought otherwise! It's a realllllyyyy good deal because my sushi pieces were humongous! I got the most fish I have EVER had on a maki roll! While there were 8 pieces per roll, the sizes were so big that at any other place, there would have been at least 12 pieces per roll. The only complaint I'd have is that a few of the pieces fell apart bc they were not rolled tightly enough  In addition to the awesome portion size, they also brought us (my bf and I) two bowls of free miso soup AND free edamame!  Let's just say that I am super impressed :)",

    "text": "I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore. I had a craving for some Korean food and went to the place nearest my office - Sushi Kim in the Strip District that boasts both Korean food and sushi.  Let me say up front - the food I received was delicious. But, I was a bit disappointed with the portion size for my lunch entree. For $12.95, I received just a few portions of ribs (I ordered the kalbi), just 3 ban-chan (side dishes of kimchi, sprouts and broccoli), a small serving of white rice and a miso soup.  Delicious food, small portions and a bit overpriced.  I was thinking of coming back to try to sushi, but I think the price structure needs to be reworked before I return.",

    "text": "My family and I had the intention of visiting another restaurant in the area but they were not open of lunch so Sushi Kim was our lunch alternative.   We were pleasantly greeted when we entered the restaurant and seated in a corner table. The service was attentive, we were brought water and green tea before our meal started. Their menu is a cross of Japanese and Korean.   We ordered a mix - my brother, the Korean beef, my dad and sister shared a sushi platter and my mom and I both got beef bulogi. Portions were reasonable, I was surprised they were not American sizes. My brother enjoyed the beef, but it did not come with rice thought. My dad and sister said the sushi was average. The beef bulogi was ok, filling but have had better across the border.   Each entree was under $12 and the sushi platter was about $15. Not bad for lunch prices.   An ok place to visit if you are on Penn Ave. I would like to compare to other japanese/korean places in the area.",

    "text": "A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked).   I'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat.   Sushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience.",

    "text": "Update to my previous review: I've gone here a few times since then hoping to reclaim the initial wonderful dining experiences I've had and all three times the fish was meh to bad. It makes me sad because when it was good, it was truly something special..  Just want to voice some dissent to all the negative reviews. I think this is some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh for the price. You can always get a table and the fish is really good. The best thing to get is a combo platter and then ask for no squid or octopus. They will really hook it up. I've never really gotten any of the rolls. I did have some of the korean food and was very underwhelmed. The short ribs are pretty sub-par and if you get the spicy fish salad I think they use almost spoiled raw fish and try to mask the flavor with the spicy sauce. However, if you stick to the combo platter I think its generally pretty great (relative to the other options)",

    "text": "First off, this restaurant is absolutely HUGE. there are a ton of tables, so i'm going to say that this place is good for groups..  When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.  We came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.  My friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...  and sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again.",
