And that's the way we all like it.  I came here with some of my union brothers and sisters after a training seminar.  We all had a hankering for some good old Americanized Chinese food and few other places around here could satisfy our cravings.  We all started out with some soups (I tried the egg flower-delicious) followed by a mix of appetizers such as vegetable rolls and steamed vegetable hand-rolled dumplings.  I went for the broccoli chicken, but we all did a little family style sharing of our dishes.  So we all did a little sampling of ginger and garlic shrimp, curry roast pork, and some vegetarian dishes.  It was a great evening with some great colleagues.  Oh and my fortune cookie?  It said \"You are a person most generous.  Pay the check.\"",

The Mongolian beef looked nothing like Mongolian beef I have ever had.  It was good, but again, not spicy enough.  Additionally, there were no sticks to eat with, no soy sauce or mustard or chili paste on the table.  The food tasted good and was cooked well (plenty of places overcook Chinese food so this is a very good thing), but it wasn't flavorful enough.  I am willing to go back and try it again.  The people were extremely nice.  It was a slow night so the service was a little slow, but helpful and very friendly.",

I think that you'll be hard pressed to find a better combination for Chinese food anywhere in Pittsburgh.  I tried this place after hearing from several people that I HAD to go there.  It turns out that they were absolutely correct!  If you like Chinese cuisine, drag yourself into town and give this place a try.  Heck, even if you don't like Chinese food or are unsure if you do, give this place a try.  I liked it so much I am giving it 5 stars...    I recommend the Egg Rolls (Very fresh), General Tso's Chicken, and Chicken Fried Rice.  If you go here and don't love the place then you just don't like Chinese food... and I feel very sad for you.  ;-)",

They said the food could take an hour (which sounded like a lot, because I live on the North Shore and they're downtown). I called after an hour when the food still hadn't arrived and I was hung up on. I called 20 minutes after, to see if I needed to cancel my order and the server guessed the food went out. About 2 minutes later I got a text that read only \"Food\". I thought maybe there was a language barrier, but when I met the delivery service, the man was clearly a native speaker. I'm shocked at how bad the service was, and that no apology was offered for my wasted evening. The food ended up being good, so dining in may be an option, but I would never order delivery.",

I stumbled upon this restaurant during my walk around Downtown Pittsburgh. The building was quite striking and hard to miss. Even the next day some kids riding in my shuttle bus pointed to that restaurant from afar, mistaking it as a tourist destination. The divided interior was just as elaborated with Chinese red colored from wall to wall. I came at the height of their lunch hour. It was a packed house but I still find myself the only Asian person in a venue where chopsticks had to take a backseat to forks and knives. The overtone of traditional aesthetics, English-only menu, and western utensils rendered my assumptions about this place, but relatively speaking this place was also to closest to what I see on Broadway in LA or Grant in SF.   With $8.51 (w/tax), I opted for their lunch special combination with Szechuan shrimps and scallops with steamed rice. The dish came with a choice of soup and my bowl of decent won tons was comforting with strings of barbeque pork. After extended wait time, my dish came with a decent portion of jumbo shrimps and scallops stir fried with bell peppers, broccoli, baby corns, water chestnuts, and carrots in a brown savory sauce. The sauce reminded me of those cold winter days eating in Boston Chinatown while the combination was fresh with scallops being my favorite.   For the price, it was certainly a better meal than any place named Panda. In terms of authenticity however, this place is far from Szechuan cuisine as the typical liberal applications of chili and garlic were desperately missing in the culinary discourse. Toned down Americanized and purposely catered to their mainstream clientele, 3 stars for the passable experience.",

I placed an online order for delivery for lunch and I won't be doing it again.   I ordered a vegetable egg roll and the eggplant in garlic brown sauce and requested that the spice level be medium. The egg roll was just okay - the duck sace that was provided came in small compote cups instead of the typical packets, it was also slightly brown and was bland. The eggplant dish was also unbelieveably bland. I've never experienced bland Chinese food, and all it did was highlight how greasy the food was.

A typical lunch special for me that comes in under $10 is General Tso's chicken with white rice, and either a bowl of soup or an egg roll.  The two adjoining dining rooms are very nice and clean with a combination of booths and tables.

The chicken was juicy and flavorful but not overly salty which is perfect. The veggies mixed in were fresh and full of flavor. It was worth the bill.   While the food from here wasn't stellar, it was good enough to make me keep the menu to order takeout again in the future. They've been in business for a long time and it was packed when I dropped in-- good sign. Crowds say a lot to me so I can't wait to order something different for us next time.",

    "text": "There is a super delicious, cute little Chinese place downtown - who knew?  We didn't. For years. Until we went on a Just Ducky tour.  We found out about the Chinatown Inn when we learned, on our Ducky tour, that there used to be a full Chinatown area in Pittsburgh. Aside from a few building facades, the Chinatown Inn is the last standing remnant of that era, and it's tucked away on a side street that makes it nearly impossible to find without word-of-mouth or a wrong turn directing you there.  And it's a shame to miss this place. It's so cozy inside, quiet, carpeted, and lined with thickly upholstered booths that give you the impression you've escaped busy city streets and stepped into a magical, relaxing little cove.  We ate just about everything on the menu. The wonton soup is probably the #2 wonton soup I've had in Pittsburgh. Their wontons are not stuffed, but the egg noodles are thick, and the bowl is filled with chicken strips and scallions. Delicious!  Even with lunch, they bring you a pot of tea at no charge, and the lunch specials offer either an egg roll or a soup of your choice for under $8. (The only odd thing is that there's no pork on the lunch menu. Not sure about dinner, but it was just chicken, beef, and seafood for lunch.)  We also added on an order of the crab rangoons, which were my favorite part of the meal. They were so crispy on the outside, so creamy on the inside. If I was craving crab rangoons, I would go out of my way to stop in here for an order.  For our entrees, we got sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken. Both were excellent. Like the crab rangoons, they achieved that perfect mix of crispy outside and juicy inside. But what I was most impressed with was the balance of meat and sauce: too often, Chinese restaurants end up overdoing the sweet and sour or General Tso's sauce, but this was just right.  We also sprung for one of the 'jumbo' egg rolls. I'll say this: it was definitely jumbo! It was the size of about three regular egg rolls (picture posted in the photo section), but the problem was that with it being so gigantic, the insides were a little mushy. The outside was perfect though, but I think if we got egg rolls again, we'd go for the normal-size ones.  All in all, this place was a hit. They've got a full bar, takeout, and really prompt service. We were in and out in well under an hour, so if you work downtown and are in the mood for Chinese, this place is just right!",

It's on a random side street and not very close to anything else in downtown and from the looks of the outside, I was skeptical of the place. But from the service to the food, it was delicious enough for us to go back AGAIN before leaving Pittsburgh!   We started our order with fried pork dumplings which were pretty good. Not too doughy and ample meat inside. Then we ordered the Mongolian Beef which was fantastic, the sauce alone was tasty enough to just eat by itself with some rice! We also got Pork fried rice which was probably one of the best I've had ever (and I eat a lot of Chinese food)! I also got the General Tso's chicken which was a HUGE order and I felt so bad we couldn't take the rest home since we were staying at a hotel!   The second time we went back, we got the Mongolian beef again and Pork Egg Foo Young. The only thing I wish was improved, was the gravy for the egg foo young. I'm used to having the creamy brown gravy and they serve it with a watery dark brown base which took away from the flavor I'm used to. All in all, I would recommend this place for an inexpensive and quick fix for your Chinese takeout cravings!",

Not to mention that the room for sitting was very narrow. Sitting at the biggest table, I thought the sofa on one side could only hold one person to comfortably sit on, even we were quite fit. That meant the largest number of people that could come to the restaurant and sit gracefully was two. The waitresses were not responsive. I asked a lady for three small bowls, but she did not give me. They never smiled, looking like I owed them money. Moreover, actually I can speak Chinese. When I heard that the waitresses were talking in Chinese, I started to talk to the lady in Chinese as well. However, in many times, she replied in English. A little bit weird, right? The last thing I have to mention. When we got the check, 15% gratuity directly displayed on the check. I gave them my credit card. When they returned the receipt to me, asking for my signature, I could see that they had already written down the 15% gratuity on the receipt \"on behalf of me\", but I never approved them to do so. This was such an offence to me. I will never come again. I hope that the waitresses there could learn to be honest, and never write down the percentage of gratuity on the receipt on behalf of their customers.",

The wonton soup was a perfect balance IMHO; scallion pancakes are the best I have ever had and all of the entrees were a great blend of what you would consider \"standard American-Chinese\" food and the restaurant's individual flare.   This place rivals places like Sesame Inn. And I know I will get heat for saying that, but that is solidly my take. I have been to the Inn several times, and am actually about to go again in a few minutes.  it might be the best prepared and most evenly-balanced chinese food in the city. I say might, because I haven't eaten at every place in the city. As far as I am concerned, it is the best.   This isn't Asian Fusion, nor fine dining. 5 stars are given based on the quality of the meal...which is superb, and I think you will like it.  Cheers!",

Once I called her to say we were close she said she had to finish up something, so we parked across from this place and waited...and waited...and waited. Okay, maybe the wait wasn't that long, but the delicious smells from Chinatown Inn wafted into Alison's car and we decided we should just go there. And go there we did! Instantly I felt comfortable because this place reminded me of the Chinese places in strip malls in Northern Virginia. There were fish in a big tank, cozy booths, and rather dim lighting. They had a lot of regulars there the Friday night we went. Most people were talking to the waiters like old friends. Our waiter was young and adorable and looked like an anime character with his spiky hair. He showed us how to fold the paper bags into the triangle point. We were FASCINATED! I wish I could remember his name to give him proper props. I ate a spicy chicken dish that opened up my sinuses. I split a plain lo mein with Natalia because were just in the mood. Everything was hot and fresh. Lovely!  To note: if you happen to be an older gentleman who is bald and owns a beige sports coat, this is where your meetings are held!

I had the Kung Pao chicken and the Szechuan chicken lunch specials (both $7.44 with tax), once with the hot and sour soup and once with an egg roll (getting two reviews here). Pittsburgh has crappy Chinese food, but this is the best place that I have come across so far (I've tried about 4-5 other places now). It does mainly cater to American's in regards to taste, but the two dishes that I tried were, in fact, pretty tasty. You will have to order the dishes extra spicy if you like spicy food, because the little chili pepper is not saying much. Now the lunch specials are a great deal: The portions aren't exactly generous, but it's about the same that you would get at a Chinese fast food place for about the same price, but with higher quality.The kung pao dish was loaded with water chestnuts and mushrooms (apparently I am the only person on earth that hates these two things), and had a hearty supply of peanuts. The S-chicken had baby corn, bell peppers and broccoli. On both occasions the fried rice was nice and moist. The hot and sour soup was on par with some of the best I've ever had and the (American) egg roll may have been the best egg roll I have ever had. The second time I came here I had to wait 20 minutes in a line out the door, so be warned about this possibility. Two nice touches about this place is the service and the decor. Most Chinese places throw service out the window but this place does not. They aren't big English speakers, but they stop by a few times to make sure your beverage is topped off. The interior is very pleasant with dark red painted walls and nice pieces of soft art.  I plan on eating here more in the future.  Food Quality/Taste = 3.5 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Price = 4 Stars Service = 4 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 4 Stars",

The beef lo mein was also okay but some of the pieces of meat were flavorless. The water kind of tastes like dust lol",

Last night (middle of August, 90+ degree heat and humidity), I did not feel like cooking, so my boyfriend and I decided to get some Chinese food. He told he had been here years ago, but not recently, and I have never been, so why not give it a try?! We got to Chinatown Inn around 9 pm and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. (I did notice that a lot of people were coming in and out to get takeout.) Upon being seated, we were given water, hot green tea, and the crispy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard. *note- the duck sauce at this place is more of a brown color and tastes a little different than the duck sauce I'm used to. Not a bad different, but different. Anyways, I digress... We ordered the crab Rangoon for an appetizer. I ordered a mixed seafood Chinese hot pot and my boyfriend ordered chicken and eggplant. The menu is really diverse.. They have a little something for everyone. Our food came out quickly and was nice and hot! Everything was really delicious and the portions were generous! My hot pot had lobster tails, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and Mixed veggies in a garlic and ginger white sauce. It was so good!! I definitely will be back to try out some other items on the menu!",

Their restaurant is always clean, has a small bar area with booth seating, and the other section has more of a fine dining atmosphere. They serve you hot delicious tea and ice water upon sitting down.  If ordering delivery, they only deliver downtown during lunch hours because they deliver via bicycle. I compared the price when ordering delivery via yelp & foodler & foodler was cheaper (& also - that's a middle man to Meals Delivered - but I like my foodler points/convert to $).  The usually offer a coupon on their website.",

If it wasn't for my BFF's admiration for this place, I probably would have never gone.   The atmosphere is very cliche downtown Chinese restaurant, but it works. I definitely felt like I was legit in Chinatown.  I ordered the chicken cashew dinner. Always a safe bet for me. The meal was good, except it was 1/2 chicken and nuts and 1/2 mushrooms. I'm not a huge mushroom person so I was taken back by how many were in my dish when it showed up in front of me.   Service is okay and very average.   A big perk about the restaurant is additional parking. It's probably the only place downtown that has a (free) parking lot for guests. You may have to drive around the block a few times, but I was able to get lucky.",

Parking was a breeze as there is a small parking lot next to the restaurant- how refreshing for Downtown!

I have had lunch in , dinner in and have had take out numerous times over the years. Chinatown has NEVER disappointed me once. I love the Shrimp Eggs Rolls, Chicken & Broccoli in the white sauce with steamed rice. I live for the Won Ton Soup !! it is so unique that they shred the pork on top of the soup and not inside the wrapper, I love that. I always get a medium bowl and a medium steamed rice on the side. After I eat the won ton, I put the rice in the soup and enjoy two soups from one bowl. Won Ton, and Chicken and Rice. The Jumbo Egg Roll is a meal in itself. Everything on the menu is good.  True the downside to Chinatown if you do not live in town is driving in, street parking is not a problem for pick up, and there are many parking garages near by. A visit to Chinatown is SO worth it. Lucy is a fantastic server and I look forward to talking with her every time I visit. I Highly Recommend and will continue to support Chinatown Inn.    Just as small side note: The actress that is the voice of Mulan in the Disney movie, is Ming-Na Wen. Her step-father and mother and younger brother have owned and operated Chinatown for years and will continue too. You can find her photo on the wall near the register.",

Their \"spicy\" items lack any heat whatsoever.  I requested that my last meal be \"extra spicy,\" and the receipt verified the order, but there was zero heat in the \"House Special Spicy Crispy Chicken.\"    I will say that I was impressed with the fried rice that came with the meal.  Unlike most places, they included bamboo shoots, veggies and egg.  The fried rice was an easy 5 stars.  That's about it.",

    "text": "This is the last Chinese restaurant left standing in what used to be Pittsburgh's Chinatown. It sits on a side street next to the city county building making it kind of a hidden gem. My coworkers and I arrived as soon as they opened and it filled up pretty fast. We were in and out within 30 - 35 minutes. If you are looking for a quick spot for lunch, definitely give this place a try.   I ordered general tso chicken with white rice ($8.88). I also specified that I wanted white meat because some places make general tso with dark meat. The rice was a little hard and not as \"sticky\" soft as I hoped it would be. One thing I noticed was the batter to chicken ratio was off. There was definitely more batter than there was chicken and that could be why it was so crispy. As much as I like crispy chicken, I wish there was more chicken under all that batter. You also get your choice of soup or an egg roll. I ordered wonton soup and was very pleased with the size of the wontons. Some of my coworkers ordered egg rolls and I have to say they were probably the biggest egg rolls I have ever seen. In my opinion, the general tso was good. I can't say that it beats sesame inn or jimmy wans, but if you are looking for a nice and clean authentic Chinese restaurant I would recommend coming here.",

This place is huge--you would have no idea from the outside.   The best part is their egg rolls. They are definitely homemade and GIGANTIC. Apparently they also do jumbo egg rolls which I can only imagine are the size of a burrito since the regular ones are so hefty! I've had a few of the basic dishes here and have never been disappointed--Shrimp Lo Mein, General Tsos, Chicken & Broccoli. While I don't ever mind dark meat chicken, I know others who really appreciate that you have the option of ordering white or dark with their General Tso's platter.  Whether you want a sit-down meal, take-out or delivery--this is a great place to check out!",

I think I have tried them all in the tri-state and this is one of my favorites. My husband had the garlic vegetables. It was slightly bland but some people probably like a mild garlic taste instead of overpowering. It also had fresh, crisp vegetables.  I started with a chicken egg roll that just about filled me up. My son had a crab rangoon appetizer but it was a bit cold. We were the only table so that was odd. The taste was fine but we like them really warm.  The tea was nice. Many restaurants do not give complimentary tea anymore. When the waitress brought it out, it made our dining experience so much better. I know it's not much, but I think it is such a great compliment to dinner.  Pleasant staff and clean inside. Overall, I would love to come back.",

The egg roll came out first and it was delicious. A really nice size and packed with shrimp and veggies. The main dish came out and the sauce they use for the beef broccoli is pretty tasty.   The water was decent and they do charge gratuity for a large groups more than 5.  I will definitely be back if im in the mood for some quick and tasty Chinese Food.",

I will also try their tea. 6/5/2017: I got General Tso Chicken yesterday.  It was very soupy.  I like my sauce thicker and sticky.  I also got Chicken and Broccoli.  I liked it bc it had watercress.  I got (2) Chicken Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but I prefer the shrimp.  It was nice bc parking is free after 6PM.    4/18/2018. Tax day is over!

Now, I don't think it is fair to stack a business against the comparisons of the best in other U.S. cities, so I really only am basing this review on the moderate level expectations I had after reading the other reviews that made me want to try this restaurant.  Unfortunately my experience was so disappointing that I doubt I will try eating here again.    I tried the War Shew duck dish (BREADED) - it was tough which I've never had tough duck to this degree but the breading I didn't expect at all - expected crispy duck from duck skin not weird breadcrumb style. I should have clued in from the \"golden fried\" description on the webpage but I was thinking more along the lines of a golden fried duck skin.  I did not finish the dish.   The other dish I had was a chow mein dish with vegetables in it but I can't remember what it was because it was just glutinous uninspired slop.  Just so disappointing.",

Today however, i was in the mood for chinese but remembered that i only had enough bus fare to get home rather than an unlimited pass.. so taking a bus to my usual chinese place was out of the question. I had my mind set on chinese so i decided to try out chinatown inn since a coworker raves about it.  I ordered my usual-- general tsos lunch special. You get to choose soup or egg roll. I chose a chicken egg roll and ohmygoooooodness it was huge.. like the size of my fist. I also had the option of white or fried rice and went with fried.   The lobby as well as the dining area seemed nice.. The girl who took my order was very kind as well as the gentleman who brought it out (in 5 minutes with no call-ahead, wooh!)  The main reason for only 3 stars is i didnt really care for the food :\\ My chicken was tasty but i did not care for the general tsos sauce. It was super thin and extremely sweet. im used to a spicy, thicker(sticky) sauce. Also, the fried rice had one (tiny) piece of onion.. i didnt see any egg or carrots, ect... just rice and bean sprouts. Finally, every chinese joint i've been to i had enough for lunch + some leftover. Chinatown inn offered same food, same price but smaller portions.   I may head back to try out something else or just stick with the egg rolls. The food was not bad but it wasnt my taste. If you like sweet general tsos sauce then you will probably like it :)",

Situated right off Grant and 3rd, it nicely tucked away and has a parking lot to the side for those driving. Once inside the lights are low and it felt peaceful and inviting. Definitely not the hole-in-the-wall I was expecting to find.   We were promptly seated in a booth in the adjacent room and provided water (we didn't want tea). The menu is both extensive and interesting. My wife opted for Honey Sesame Chicken with fried rice and I got the Ma Po Tofu with steamed rice.   While we waited for our entrees we were given fried wonton wrappers and a sweet (maybe chutney?) and horseradish sauce. These weren't the highlight of the meal, but were nice to munch on.   The meals came out piping hot and with more than enough for 4 people to share. The portions are very large but everything was fresh and flavorful.   The Ma Po Tofu wasn't what I expected given I've had this in Hong Kong a number of times, but I liked the soupiness and it had some pickled vegetables much like a hot and sour soup does.   My wife's meal was very tasty as well--I liked it better than my own and the fried rice was just like I remembered it from my time in HK. Way more authentic than fried rices you will get at other Chinese places.   All around a really good meal with plenty of leftovers for the days to come. Definitely coming back :)",

It's got such a serene atmosphere and it's really a nice way to enjoy a relaxing meal, especially when ducking in from the hustle and bustle of weekday downtown life.  Dinner is a nice time as well, relaxed and peaceful.   Even if it's super busy at lunch or dinner it's still peaceful.  The food of course is the best part.

Since as long as I can remember (late 1980, early 1990s?), the folks that own it and everyone who's managed it since then have been amazing!   The atmosphere is chill, and it was the first place I went out to eat after I moved back to Pittsburgh. It's where I take (or get take-out for) friends from out of state when they visit. The food here is what I measure all other Chinese restaurants to, period.   Praying for many continued years of delicious success!",

Quite a wait for main course. But it was worth the wait. Large portion. Asparagus shrimp lunch, white rice. Good. Won ton soup, good but too salty. Will alter your order for taste",

We were seated immediately upon arrival. We ordered egg rolls for the entree which arrived lukewarm. For my entree I ordered General Tso's chicken which was again lukewarm and soggy. The fried rice was amazing, the best part of the meal. We also ordered egg foo yung. The patty itself was good but the gravy was thin and sweet, I'm used to thick savory gravy for egg foo yung. Kudos for the fried rice, I would highly recommend it but everything else was not memorable for me.",

It was kinda like Japanese curry--more liquidy and has some nice spice. They had a very good chili sauce if you want it hotter. Veggies are broccoli, carrots, potato, onion, water chestnuts, snow peas, and baby carrots.  Was a bit too salty. The curry came already poured over the rice--I'm sure you can ask to get them served separately. Lunch special comes out to $10 even, which is nice. Egg roll is HUGE! Has cabbage, onion, and maybe carrot inside. Very solid. I would def return.",

Szechuan Chicken was great as well with crispy vegetables in a light sauce!",

Those few were the ones i actually read fully. sad to say i must agree.   Went here yesterday on a sunday afternoon around 2:30 or so. The place was clean and looked really nice inside. We were seated a couple of tables from the bar, which looked awesome, nice flat screen t.v. My mom and i had the wonton soup, egg rolls and pork dumplings as an appetizer.   i thought the wonton soup and dumplings/sauce were very good. The egg rolls were okay but i think people believe theyre all that due to their size. One reviewer here said that the insides had the consistency of baby food. This was True...i had the chicken egg roll and when i opened it up everything was mashed together. im used to being able to tell whats in my egg roll, i had no clue what i was even eating.   my mom had the veggie egg roll and she had no problems with it. We did have tea  and that was good. For the main meal i had chicken/beef chow fun and my mom had chicken chow mein. i stopped getting chow mein of any kind because its always all veggies and not enough meat. when hers arrived all i could see was green and white veggies with tiny strips of chicken. Mine had flat/fat rice noodles with huge chicken pieces and i had to literally try and find the beef. Whats sad is the chicken was bland,  while the beef actually gave the dish flavor.   i could go to my local Chinese rest called No. 1 Chinese in verona and get better chicken than that. I dont agree that this place is THE best chinese place in pgh because pgh doesnt have really good chinese anywhere! maybe in other states just not here.  I would go again because im curious as to how their general tso's tastes and i really liked the chow fun. i just wont get it with chicken next time : P",

The egg rolls are always mushy.  The outside is awesome, but it's cat poop with mushrooms inside.  I think the meat/main portion of the meal is a bit slim while you get a ton of rice to try and fill you up.    The broccorri is acceptable.  The service is pretty lousy, but most Chinese places have lousy service.  Paying for your meal is actually painless and they almost always split the check automatically.  Good stuff.  It's very LOUD.  I have no idea why but it seems like the Chinese joints downtown are amplified.  I find myself yelling across the table to have a conversation.  Go down the street and hit Mandarin Goumet instead.  The food is better.  Still loud and always crowded though.",

During weekends, the next room holds a live karaoke and that's where I fell in love with this place.  The food is just as good!  I normally order the scallion pancakes, the hot won ton soup and chinese spinach and it's always tasted so good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.. highly recomended place for sure!",

I could eat a whole plate of them alone. General Tso's chicken is great. The Cantonese Style Tomato Chili Chicken was not at all what I thought it would be, but it wasn't bad. Delivery takes forever through Grub Hub, and the restaurant forgot one of our veggie rolls, which Grub Hub reimbursed. Those are my only complaints. We will probably order again.",

The cashew chicken came with a handful of large cashews on top.  Place was bustling, with everyone looking like they were enjoying their meals too.",

Well this time I got general tso, egg roll, crab wonton. General tso chicken was so mushy and the sauce was thick like it was left over from the night before. The crab wonton were so over cooked you could not rip them apart and when I finally did there was hardly any filling. Only thing that was ok was the egg roll. I called and complained because Chinatown Inn is expensive and since I was not going to eat it I wanted my money back. My Roomate got chicken Lomein and egg roll. She returned hers as well. Her Lomein was gummy and no flavor. We got back they were rude and accused us of eating half of it when there was 3 prices of chicken out of it and now in my garbage can. I told them to charge me for the egg roll because that's the only thing that's was good. They did but they were not happy about refunding us. Never returning terrible experience, terrible attitude about their own product.",

The beef and broccoli has a liquidy, mouth-watering sauce that is soaked into the broccoli and meat, providing an amazing experience for one's taste buds. Whats even more awesome, are the daily lunch specials. These give you a regular entree, along with your choice of rice and your choice of soup or egg roll, for only $8.50 or so. ALL of the food is cooked well and never failed to please me. With the extremely affordable price that can sometimes be cheaper than fast food, and the absolutely wonderful food selections, Chinatown Inn makes a spectacular meal that can't be missed.",
