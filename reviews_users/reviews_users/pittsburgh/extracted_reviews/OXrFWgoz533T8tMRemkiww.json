    "text": "Food was great. Pasta prepared perfectly, pizza, meatballs and rice balls excellent. Meatballs could have been warmer but tasted divine. I also liked that they served us 4 rice balls. 2 with meat and 2 without. We were a party of 4. Inside is a little noisy but a lively Italian restaurant feel --not stiff. Maybe some textiles would dilute the noise level. Good thing we had a reservation, it was busy. We were asked if we wanted to sit outside. It was probably 59 degrees. Outside seating was full. Noise level was better. We could hear each other talk. Great lighting and atmosphere. Another customer told me this was her favorite spot to sit. I'd suggest a few heat lamps...was cold.  Then the only weird thing is they said they had a call out and couldn't offer dessert...they were closing early. I guess stuff happens...I know they weren't going to make tiramisu fresh, figured just take it from fridge and give it to go. Maybe a little something for inconvenience like free dessert. I was visiting from 4 hours away and this was a special occasion. I would go back. Great penne. Would have liked baked ziti but this was just as good.",

    "text": "I'm a little torn on how to rate this restaurant.  There were several items that were really good, but yet there were a few areas that left a bad feeling in my mouth.  The arancini - the Sicilian and Neapolitan Fried Rice Balls - were top notch and I would get over and over.  There were four little fried balls of risotto that were so good.  We also had the insalata misticanza - which they graciously split in half for us.  It was your typical salad.  We then had the cavatelli con rapini - with sausage and rapini - as well as the bucatini all'amatriciana - with Guanciale and onions.  Both dishes had unique flavors.  However, the cavatelli came out luke warm and I had to send it back to be warmed.  It also had too much sausage - it more than dominated the pasta.  So - that's the food review.  As for the staff - it left a little to be desired.  First off - we had a reservation and I had requested an outside seating on the phone.  In essence, they told me they don't take reservations for the outside - it's first come first serve when you get there.  So - when we got to the restaurant I asked and they told me that it would be a good 30 minute wait.  So we sat inside.  Then after we ordered our drinks, I went to look at the patio b/c I had heard it was very nice...and there were several open tables.  I didn't understand where our 30 minute wait was.  Then when I get back to my table, I see the waitress seating a couple outside...who came in after us.  If it's first come first serve for the patio - how come it was a 30 minute wait for us, but not for the other couple?  I just felt that they might have catered to people who were their 'regulars'.  On top of that - our waitress wasn't always the most attentive.  While the food was good (once it was warm), I'm not sure I would come back due to the other factors.",

Beautiful night and it was a great little place to sit.  First thing I noticed was they had Nora, a great Italian beer that is hard to find in the states.  Started with the cheese plate, mussels in white wine and the arranccini(?), or rice balls.  It was all very good.  For dinner, the table had sausage, broccoli and cheese with a white sauce, that was just Ok.  The homemade Italian Wedding soup was very good.  My wife had the papperdelle pasta with mushrooms which was good.  I had the veal scaloppine which was outstanding.  All in all was a very good dinner  Solid 3.5 stars, but I rounded up for this one",

    "text": "Il Pizzaiolo means the pizza maker, in Italian.  Well, let me tell you that our pizza maker (Il Pizzaiolo restaurant in downtown Mt. Lebanon) has some pretty extraordinary food selections and spectacular brick-oven pizza.  The rustic atmosphere and the intimate summer patio complement the restaurant, while the chic wine bar gives it a modern edge.    Il Pizzaiolo is our favorite Italian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area and before I really started cooking at home it was our every other day go-to restaurant.  We are still fascinated by their commitment to always serve excellent authentic Italian food.  Il Pizzaiolo is so devoted to using the best ingredients available that they get their mozzarella di bufala straight from Napoli, Italy, every week.  They also hand-make their own pasta, meatballs, sweet fennel sausage, etc...  Some of our favorite items on the menu are the Antipasto Napoli, a delicious mixture of roasted vegetables drizzled with golden extra virgin olive oil; the light and at the same time hearty Prosciutto e Arugula Pizza; and the superb drunken pasta also known as Penne alla Vodka as listed on the menu.  Please check my full review to learn more about Il Pizzaiolo and the other 13 exquisite dishes, lunch sandwiches and drinks with pictures that we've ordered during our many visits to Il Pizzaiolo, such as Vitello alla Milanese, Antipasto Misto or Linguine alle Vongole to name just a few:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsimplyromanesco.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F02%2Fleave-gun-take-cannoli.html&s=1de41a4b0c19fb2f0a4b2826f345d2e42cd465f28db9416be9d6591bf15826ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">simplyromanesco.blogspot...</a>",

Pizza: Has become smaller with time, soggy bottomed and the price has risen.    2 adults, 1 child: 1 glass of wine, 2 small pizzas and a salad: $70 before gratuity.    \"Il Pizz\" has taken for granted the community good will by rewarding us with smaller portions, lesser quality food and a higher priced menu.

I highly recommend the pizza, just like many other reviewers. It is Neapolitan style, and is some of the best specialty pizza I've ever had. The pasta dishes are also great. Their homemade gnocchi was the first gnocchi I ever tried, about 15 years ago. I've still never found a better gnocchi. If you have room for dessert, try the cannoli. It is very large and can be shared.    I also like the wine bar out back, though I'm not sure why they call it that. It's a full bar. Like the rest of the restaurant, the bar is not cheap. If the menu were slightly more affordable, I'd probably go here every week.",

Yes, it might not be everyone's favorite pizza but it's a certain type of preparation and you have to like it in order to like it....(if you understand what I mean). Their Margherita DOC pizza is bellisimo!  The wine room and the outdoor area are both wonderful places to enjoy a meal.  The main restaurant is also very nice but if you can get into the wine room or the patio--do it.  A little tip: they have a wonderful Falanghina (white Italian wine) that tastes amazing on the patio.  Their caprese is excellent and fresh and if they have the burrata appetizer---GET IT and you will be thrilled.  Their potato croquettes are also marvelous.  The wait staff is always very nice.

I would have given this place 5 stars alone off the pizza but I was craving pasta so I ordered simple ol' spaghetti.  You can tell they make everything in house at this restaurant.  The noodles were fatter than I've seen in spaghetti but they were perfectly al dente and just so wonderful.  You could taste the love they put into making their dough.

    "text": "The original Mt. Lebanon establishment is still doing what it has done consistently well since 1996. That is, to offer food and pizza similar to what you will find in the city of Naples. While I was happy that Mr. Molinaro opened a place in the city at Market Square, I refuse to return to that restaurant for the reasons that follow. First and foremost, Mr. Molinaro is no longer involved in the Market Square operation. It is well known now that he went back to Mt. Lebo full time due to pressure from his partners who decided to cut back on the quality that has made Mr. Molinaro one of the most respected restaurateurs in Pittsburgh. Perhaps a lot of folks will not notice the difference, but when you start fooling with the pizza by switching from Italian flour to a domestic knock off, then I have a problem with that and it undermines the entire idea of the restaurant. More specifically, prices are not reduced commensurate with the cheaper ingredients. So, at Market Square, they can employ this culinary sleight of hand to an unassuming public but I will not give them a penny more of my money.  Therefore, I have been back to the Mt. Lebo original for a while now and it is still excellent. Everything from the espresso to the Pizza is infinitely better than downtown because Ron Molinaro has not deviated from his idea of offering food that is True to  Naples. His steadfast refusal to reduce quality for the sake of profit is what I respect about him. He maintains friendly and knowledgeable staff who know the food and the wine list. You cannot go wrong here and I will continue to support this place and any other that Mr. Molinaro opens.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.  The main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about the food here. On the one hand, they use very fresh ingredients, and they bring some obvious skill to the kitchen. The salads are excellent, and the toppings for the pizzas are of very good quality. These pies leave something to be desired, however, and I think it's that they're not cooking the tops of the pizzas enough. The bottom of the pies have the requisite dark char and uneven black spots that we've come to expect from a wood fired hearth oven, but the tops of the pies aren't cooked enough. I know at some places they lift the pies to the top heat source of the oven before pulling them out, and this gives them that final bubbly cheesy goodness that we all love. They don't do that here, and the pizzas lack a certain unctuous and gooey quality that I like. The dough is also a bit thick and not crispy enough.   As I mentioned, the salads are great. I especially like their Caesar, which has just the rich acid/oil balance, super fresh romaine, a bit of garlic, anchovies that aren't too fishy, and good quality cheese to top it off. I was unaware until my most recent visit that they have a patio and wine bar in the back. The patio is a courtyard, so no street traffic to bum you out on nice warm days, and the wine bar has table seating and a more adult, relaxed atmosphere than the seating in the front. It's also dark and cozy, so perfect for a cold winter night. The pizza doesn't quite hit the mark for me, and I wish it did, as I really like this spot.",

Then somehow our order was lost.  Mind you there were probably two other tables.  Appetizer consisted of two different kinds of rice balls. The one with the white sauce inside was much tastier  The tortelloni was very good.  The gnocchi was overcooked and a bit mushy.  The cannoli was delicious!  More than enough for two people to share.  Very slow service.  They were kind enough to not charge us for the appetizer since it pretty much came out with dinner.",

The hostess said we had another 20 minutes to wait.   We went up to the wine bar to wait where we met 2 other groups that had been waiting for an hour, as well.   The manager had allowed a group of 11 with a reservation inside to move to the outside patio, bumping everyone on the list. That manager explained that we didn't understand the reservation system and it was a miscommunication on our part.  The other two groups were sat immediately after they yelled at the manager -- we waited another 15 minutes.   It turns out the group of 11 was 3-4 adults and the rest of the group was children who wandered around the back patio and played video games.   The manager came over at the end of the meal to comp two pizzas ($32 off a bill of $96).",

We had a doughy (for wood fired) bland and small (fit on a plate) mushroom pizza (19) and a Caprese salad (16)which consisted of  3 balls of mozz and 4 slices of tomato.  Sodas are in a small bottle, and are 2-3 dollars for a 10 ounce bottle, no refills.    I've had much better food for a more reasonable price although I am more than happy to pay for good food!  I'm guessing the prices reflect the area but the restaurant has no character and is loud.",

    "text": "We live close by and wanted to check this place out. Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch.   I had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There were no sides, salad and even bread to go with the meal but the size of my portion was ok. The only issue I had, besides the high cost, was that my meal had no surprises.  It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, prosciutto and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it. A vegetable or anything would have improved the meal and helped me get through the overwhelming taste of the sauce.    My husband had the lasagna which was very good but cost $19 and I know it did not fill him up. Again it was simple in design and we were expecting something more coming from an Italian background.  Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous.   If prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amount you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19, one of the upscale restaurants in the area. In my opinion, they have a far better menu, it is creative, hearty and the atmosphere is trendy. We went there this summer and I loved everything about the place. Even though it's on the expensive side, Bistro 19 is definitely worth it.",

Half of us were there early and the others staggled in (which is so inappropriate, but what can ya do?), and this meant no free bread for like 45 minutes. Yes, I'm very much into the bread basket.   So let's talk about that! The bread was fresh and soft, and the olive oil was perfect with it. Yeah, we inhaled it.   We ordered the quattro formagio. It was so wonderful with great flavor and melty goodness. I asked for mushrooms on my part of the pizza and they kindly obliged with a ton of deliciously cooked mushrooms. They have to be the best I've ever had.   While I do suck at remembering what wine was ordered, it was a yummy white! I can't drink much, but I'll take little sips for special situations.   Our server was also phenomenal. He kept 16 people happy and handled various diet needs and requests like a champ.  I guess my main issues with this place that resulted in 4 stars versus 5 are:  Service was slow even for tables without 16. They should have brought the bread sooner. The bathroom had no toilet paper at one point.   I would eat here again if the opportunity presented itself! I'm glad I got to enjoy a great meal with friends at a new place!",

Fine, we went down the block to the Saloon for a couple beers( awesome). Got close to the hour mark and headed back to Pizzaiolo. Approached different hostess with our name and was told they don't have my name listed. Are you f....en kidding me. We saw many open tables so they sat us immediately. Was told hostess was new, really? Can't put in a name correctly in an IPAD! Sat for over 5 min at table before our server came over. So first and second impression are you're terrible. Pizza was very good, just disappointed in service and hostess for my first time here. Food very good, maybe I'll give them another try sometime.",

The front of the restaurant seemed like a fancy restaurant packed to the brim with people and having a classy/clean atmosphere. But the back part of the restaurant had a completely different feel to it!! Dimmed lights - light up bar - in a very tight space- but it was cozy and quant as well with a fireplace.   The waitress was super attentive and helping us decipher the menu and getting us what we wanted. One objection I have with Italian restaurants are that their menus are Italian which puts me into translation mode because I'm far from Italian- just a joke.   The food was very fresh in authentic- exactly what lasagna should taste like. Pasta was made fresh and cooked to perfection- sauce was on point- and oooohhh the cheese. I ate it all in 5 mins- may have not even used my silverware and just stuffed my face into it! I went there after working out and was starving- probably could set a world record for eating- the fact the food was soo good definitely helps.  Great place for a date night . Get a reservation- we were lucky we got a seat !",

    "text": "I rarely go to Mt. Lebanon to eat but my friend took me here on a dinner date!  First of all he made reservations online and specified he wanted seating outside on the patio. When we got there they did have seating available but not on the patio/courtyard so we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated where we wanted.  Next they guided out back to the courtyard which was beautiful. They had nice big trees covered in lights with statues and flowers around. The building had green vines growing up the side of them, was like a little slice of Italy in someone's back yard! It was romantic and quaint little area. We enjoyed it immensely! Only thing that bothered me was customers a few tables over we're obnoxiously loud and talking to the neighboring table across from them since they ran into people they knew.  Now onto the food we got served bread which was ok. Basically their pizza dough with olive oil and a small sprinkle of parsley. It was good but could of been spruced up a bit with some more flavors. My companion orders the lasagna which was delicious and cooked perfectly. It had a nice balance of cheese, sausage, and noodles. Then I ordered the gnocchi verde which was to die for!! The gnocchi has spinach and ricotta cheese mixed in it covered in a delectable sage and butter sauce. I have to say it was the best gnocchi I ever tasted!! I highly recommend trying this dish some point in your life time! The gnocchi just melted in your mouth and was so flavorful.   Overall the food was fantastic! Only reason I gave 4 stars was having to wait for the seats we wanted, the bread could of been spiced up a bit,  and I didn't like how I had to walk past the servers area ( putting in people's orders and talking ) to get out to the courtyard.",

The ingredients were good but very salty and the tomato sauce retained a canned taste. The sausage and rapini pizza was at least crisp but still a bit salty with quality ingredients. When crispy the crust was the best part - noticeable salt taste which I usually like but with the salty toppings watch your blood pressure.   Price - 1 bottle root beer and 2 pizzas (6 thin slices each) for $42 including tip. 0 stars  Bottom line - would not go 5 minutes to pay this much for this little. Sorry, Il Pizzaiolo.",

Il Pizzaiolo is the best pizza place in the city, since the deeply lamented demise of Roberto's. HOWEVER, the Margherita DOC is not right. There is no place for parmigiano in a Margherita. If you want to use parmigiano, fine, but call the pizza something else. In my opinion, it is not an improvement. (If anyone out there knows more than I do, please correct me.)   The Antipasto Napoli, a mixed plate of vegetables, is excellent and authentic. In particular the eggplant and the zucchini are outstanding. I also get cravings for the arugula and proscuitto pizza.  The wine list is good, appropriately all-Italian, and over-priced. The wine bar in back is very cute, rather dark, and just as noisy as the front room. Nothing but hard surfaces back there. It would be SO nice if there was something to absorb some sound.  Still, this is a favorite place and the only place to get - if choosing carefully - the real Neapolitan taste.",

    "text": "I live in Jersey so I know a good Italian restaurant when I eat in one, and this place is really good. We came on a slow weeknight and were seated right away. We ordered a meat and cheese platter to start, and it was excellent with different kinds of imported stuff that I can't pronounce but I can assure you did not go to waste. I had a pasta special which was made with sausage ragu and was absolutely delicious. My wife had a chicken dish which was on the plain side, but cooked perfectly and very tasty. They have a small all-Italian wine list, which I would describe as slightly north of reasonably priced ($40-50 a bottle and up), and as is the trend these days, they have a beer list with some interesting Italian \"birra artigianale\" selections. We wrapped up the evening with a cocktail in the wine bar out back which is a neat little space with a bar, a seating area with a fireplace, and a decent sized dining area.",

The caesar salad is one of the BEST I have ever had, but the pizza is one, if not the worst I have ever had. I ordered the margarita, sauce, cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar.",

Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago, but assumed it was a one-night thing.  In the era of credit and debit cards being accepted everywhere (even McDonalds and 7-11) it seems inexcusable for a decent restaurant to make patrons withdraw money from an ATM before dining there.  I'm sure we will still try Il Pizzaiolo, but at the moment I'm extremely annoyed with them!  We made the sacrifce and went to Bistro 19 next door.",

I got their Linguini vongole which was done perfectly and my brother's daily special (bucatini with braised pork) tasted fabulous. The ambiance is ok - it's romantic but definitely a bit too noisy but what do you expect out of a space so small. As nice as my waiter was, they didn't time our foods right (brought entrees out while we were still eating our appetizers) and they started to cleared the table when not everyone at the table was finished.  This wasn't that big of a deal but when you're at a trendy restaurant, you expect a bit more than what you'd see at the Olive Garden. Also, if you get annoyed with yuppy moms who bring their newborns and 3 yr old kids that 'behave really well', this place will get on your nerves. I got cut in line placing my name in for a table by some lady who felt entitled to cut in front of the several other ppl waiting bc she had a baby with her. Then I went to the back bar area where half the bar stool seating and the sofa sitting area was being taken up by children under 4 and baby carriages. Just beware of the self entitled yuppies that frequent this place and every nice restaurant on Washington Ave. the experience will lower your dining experience as it did mine!",

    "text": "After eating at Bistro 19 I was very excited when I saw that Il Pizzaiolo was right next door.  I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said, I went to Il Pizzaiolo last night with my fiance, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  We started with the Caesar salad, which was OK.  The dressing was delicious, however there was very little of it, and we found ourselves eating entire bites of dry, flavorless lettuce.  It was also an outrageous $10 dollars.  Don't get me wrong, had this been an entree sized portion, $10 would have been more than appropriate.  However it was just a starter size, and should have been no more than $6.  We then shared their margherita pizza which had delicious flavors, but was incredibly soggy.  It was also fairly small, but that was almost to be expected.  It was $12 dollars, so the size was not necessarily a problem, however it was hard to enjoy such a soggy mess of a pizza.  We also shared a pasta dish which was INCREDIBLY overpriced.  At $17 dollars, I was expecting more than a small bowl filled with dry pasta.  It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.  We finished with tiramisu which was excellent, and appropriately priced at $8.  In all, I found the flavors of their food to be excellent, however i was horribly misled.  Not only was every menu I found online roughly $2 to $3 dollars cheaper than their actual menu, but there was a table next to us who ordered pasta and received an enormous portion, prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great, however for a Tuesday night, I would have thought their kitchen could time the courses properly; we had barely started our salad when the entree's came.  In all, I don't think I will be going back to this restaurant, nor would I recommend anyone waste their time traveling out to Mt. Lebanon for average Italian.",

    "text": "Dinner& Movie: After the downpour, the thunder clapped, the lightening flashed, the skies parted and \"date night!\" arrived.  My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \"thanks a lot\" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.  I did have to hunt him down for red pepper flakes, a refill on water and our small table became quite crowed and yet he did not remove the bread basket/plates.  I grew up in Mt. Lebanon and know that sometimes the neighborhood can be a bit \"snooty-pooty\" but I would go back.  But not on a Friday night and honestly it would not be in my first choice out of the other nearby restaurants.",

Here is the magic words to unlock this experience -- Tell the hostess downstairs that you will wait for a table upstairs (you want to eat up there and you will be waiting there in the meantime) and to come find you up there when the table is ready, then go up and get a martini or glass of wine at the dimly lit blue bar and enjoy the candles and fire place, then enjoy the meal!

    "text": "My very first review, be gentle, here goes:  Confession, I joined Yelp one time specifically because of this place!  Their Margherita pizza and Penne Alla Vodka are listed as my last meal for a reason!  Whenever I come here, I don't eat the whole day so I can enjoy my carb fest!  As reviewers have stated previously, the service is hit or miss at this establishment.  I have had days where the host/hostess has seated my party promptly and had the most efficient waitress/waiter during my stay.  Then there have been times where I've felt like a nuisance for my presence.  That said, the food is so divine that I really don't care, it's worth the chance!  As Kat M. stated in a previous review, the ingredients are all authentic and high quality and it is a stand out amongst many restaurants in the area.  The crust is chewy, with that  Neapolitan type char to the bread.  The Mozzarella is creamy and floats on top of the sauce in a gooey little pockets. The sauce, goodness the sauce, it's bright and delectably simple.  In fact, it makes my mouth water to think of it.  Their pasta choices are always on par as well.  I order the Penne Alla Vodka, no fail, every time.  I actually had to learn how to make my own because I had to cut corners on my budget at one time!   They always have nice drink selections, but I love that they serve the small Coca-Cola bottles with a glass of ice, it gives the experience that European touch!  It's affordable and delicious, definitely a no-brainer for a great, casual night out with friends.  I no longer live in the area and I still crave a weekend in the Pittsburgh area just so I can get a pie!  My friend from L.A. consistently gushes about her pizza and pasta that she had whilst she visited me almost four years ago!  \"Oh, what I wouldn't do for some Il Pizzaiolo!\"  I couldn't agree more.  It makes me want to check Kayak for some cheap tickets to PIT!",

In fact, we got seated in the back corner by the fountain, which is not a normal table, but one of those stone garden tables.  Despite not being the most comfortable of seats, it was by far the most enchanting part of the patio.  I thought the pizza was \"eh.\" The dough was a little \"doughy' for my taste.  I was significantly more impressed with my pasta dish, which was incredibly delicious, but also incredibly rich, so I had to leave about half of it.  I guess that's what I get for ordering pastas with cream sauce.  In summary - a cute place for a date if you can sit outside.  I didn't find the inside half as exciting.  I'll give them another chance on the pizza, but even if you don't have that, try the pasta.",

We showed her it was black on the bottom.   It tasted like charcoal. We had Caesar salads before they were so-so.  But told our server we could not eat the burnt pizza. To our surprise they don't take the pizza off the check.....it's their policy. So we had to pay for a pizza we could not eat. We will never go back!!!",

    "text": "Margherita DOC, here I come!  After tasting this pizza, I almost told my family we had to move to the South Hills from 40 minutes away in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. I'm very happy I live in the same town, as many others have stated that they miss it from hundreds or thousands of miles away.  Service? Who cares? I've never had anything to complain about. Pizza is served quickly and another post says it's because it cooks in a 1000 degree oven in 30 seconds. I don't know if it's True but they do get it to your table in 5 minutes flat. The crust is the best anywhere. The DOC version of the Margherita has buffalo mozzarella cheese in little pools and sparse but excellent basil leaves. Google Margherita DOC or Margherita DOP and you'll see others around the world.  A great meal: Have the Margherita DOC and sit at an outside (back yard) table. You'll feel like you're in Italy.  I've found nearly exactly the same taste only twice: Once in Civitivecchia, Italy and once in Prague, Czech Republic at Ambiente Pizza Nuovo (across the street from the Palladium shopping center). I travel to Prague often and always look forward to their Margherita DOP. It is exactly the same pie as the Margherita DOC at Pizzaiolo. I guess the \"Vera Pizza\" at both the Prague and Pittsburgh restaurants is some kind of certification.  So I'm having some Pizzaiolo Margherita DOC in about 2.5 hours. Can't wait!",

The pizza is the best in the area--exquisite crust, nice ingredients. Pricey, though. And parking is a pain. Luckily, Mt Lebo parking tickets are like $7.00, which is what you'd pay at a downtown garage anyway.",

    "text": "I love this place. It gets busy on the weekends, with waits well over an hour sometimes, but that should be a sign of its exceptional quality. They have a wine bar in the back where you can grab a drink while you wait, or you can also head down the street to one of the other bars on the street until they call you to tell you your table is ready. That usually makes the wait seem very reasonable. We happen to live within walking distance so we have frequented this restaurant probably more often than we should, however, we have not had a single bad experience here and that is why we keep coming back. I lived in Italy for quite some time and have to say that the pizza at this restaurant is very much like the pizzas they make over there. They use the freshest ingredients, many of them flown in directly from Italy, and you can taste the difference. There are many good things to try on the menu, but I would recommend the insalata caprese with buffala mozzerela, arancini (rice balls filled with cheese) la margherita pizza D.O.C (this means the ingredients meet Italian standards of authenticity...make sure that's buffala mozzerella as well), the gnocchi, and most of their specials tend to be very good (ask your server). The house chianti is very good, and they have a great selection of other wines and beers. Many people may claim to have a better pizza in this city, and that's fine depending on how you like your pizza and what style is your preference, (I also like a good NY style pizza) but if you want an authentic Italian pizza, this is your place.",

However, the prices are so high for the food that I have stopped going. $17 for a indiviudal pizza? The wine selection also has gone down in quality and up in price. If you have money to burn, then head there for the Pizza and ambiance. Othwerwise let's hope they come to their senses about their pricing.",

Excellent cocktails and appetizers. We ordered 2 pasta dishes, 1 pizza and 1 calzone. The 2 other tables that sat after us received both their appetizers and their entrees were delivered before ours.  Finally our pasta dishes arrived. Then about 5 mins later our pizza arrived.  During that delivery I informed our waitress that my pasta was too hard and she took it back to the kitchen. Finally the calzone arrived.  My husband and sons finished their meals and I had yet to receive my pasta.  When I finally received it, it was good but not worth $18 for a cup of pasta.  I doubt if we would ever go back based on the poor service from the kitchen.",

    "text": "I have had two dining experiences there with extremely poor service. A restaurant at this price point must do better. I sent the following message to the managers and proprietor who could not be bothered to reply.    First let me say that I think that the food at Il Pizziaolo is outstanding. Everything is prepared perfectly. I enjoy the food so much that last night I decided to bring my mother there who is Cleveland Magazine's food Critic, Laura Taxel. The food was excellent as always but the service left much to be desired. When we arrived we were ushered to the overcrowded wine bar where the bartender was clearly overwhelmed. I had to give her my drink order three times and wait 20 minutes before we had a cocktail. When we were seated and ordered a bottle of wine we were told that the restaurant was out of wine glasses and we would have to wait for our bottle. We told the server, who did an excellent job under the circumstances,  that we would be happy to drink our wine out of table glasses but he never brought it out. Then when we got our appetizer which included a dip to be spread we were told that there was no bread. We were also offered olive oil for dipping but it was never brought out. We were almost done with the appetizer by the time the wine came out.  The most disappointing thing to me was that the manager never touched the table to apologize for running out of wine glasses and bread.   Furthermore this was the second time in a row that there were major service issues. The last time I dined there my wife and I ordered our appetizer, pizza, and entrees at the same time and all of the food was brought out at once.  We had to send the entrees back and the food was wasted.  This is one of  my wife and my favorite restaurants but to have two consecutive experiences with such poor service is very unfortunate. Thank you for your time.",

I've heard so much about this place, and wasn't sure what to expect but the food was just so good. As I walked in I was a little underwhelmed by the inside, but as you walk out the back door it opens up into a big beautiful patio. We sat on the patio and as it got dark the lights turned on and there was a huge tree with a vine right in the middle, and it was pretty magical.   They also have another building with a wine bar that you walk into from the patio with a comfy leather couch and additional seating and a small bar. The bar tender was very helpful in helping me try different Italian wines that I might enjoy.   Once we got our table on the patio, we ordered arancini's and meatballs as appetizers. Both were delicious. Then after much consideration I ordered the ravioli caprese and they were awesome. Our waitress was lovely and very helpful as well. Great experience!",

The server was amateur and quite frankly, disinterested. The food was average, at best. The portion sizes were absurdly small, and the cost was criminal. Back to the server (Chelsea)....never brought us bread, never refilled our water, never asked if we wanted sides, and clearly could have cared less. And not to mention, never told us upfront about the many items that they ran out of that evening. We only found out by asking and consequently having to study the menu and settle for third or fourth choices. That was my last visit.....best of luck with your great customer service & overpriced menu. #wherestheservice",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were searching for the perfect place for dinner and drinks in the Mt Lebanon/Bridgeville area, and this restaurant immediately came to mind! Even on a Friday afternoon, we were still able to snag an 8:30 dinner reservation that evening for two. I was so excited to return after having such a nice lunch with my sister in law several months ago.  As it was a hectic Friday evening, service was initially a little slow. It took the hostess 5-10 minutes to seat us at our table, and our waitress was also MIA for a while when we were ready to order wine. However, I quickly forgave the minor delays when I took my waitress up on her dinner recommendation. We started with the Arancini, but really, you can't go wrong with fried rice balls. I did enjoy that there were two varieties that we were both able to try. I had planned to order the Cavatelli Rapini, but my waitress so passionately recommended the Cappelletti that I had to go with her recommendation. Wow, I am so happy that I did. The pasta had a beautiful smooth texture and fresh flavor while the mortadella, prosciutto, pork, and parmigiano-reggiano filling was hearty and robust and just simply divine. This tasty homemade concoction was topped with a rich and decadent tomato sauce.   I wished that I had room for more because the heavenly lemon dessert that I shared last time was amazing. However, I was just too full and will have to return yet again to try more on the menu.",

Il Pizzaiolo totally nailed it in my opinion!   While the dining area is on the small side and it did get pretty loud (keep this in mind because it could be an issue), the food was delicious.  From my wedding soup and veggie antipasti to my pasta pomodoro and cannoli, I was completely satisfied and enjoyed every bite. Only improvement could be that the wedding soup was slightly under salted. The pomodoro was perfectly seasoned and I could eat that cannoli every day! It actually had ricotta filling as it should!   Service was fast and friendly although our waiter did struggle a bit to remember our order. Very neat and clean. Regardless, it was a fantastic experience and I will absolutely be back for another delicious meal. Totally worth the price in my opinion!",

I've been coming here for years and have tried just about everything on the menu at ll Piz- some of my favorites being the Marghertia D.O.C pizza, Panzarotti, Arancini, Insalata Caprese, Penne Alla Vodka, and of course their wide selection of wine. Their food is fresh and so simple that it melts in your mouth. It reminds me of food that you would eat while in Italy.   The restaurant atmosphere is amazing, and what's better than the court yard on a Summer day or the wine bar on a cold Winter night? The court yard is so cute, it is my mom and mine favorite thing to do in the summer! I also love the wine bar, it is the \"hidden gem\" of Il Piz, located in the building behind the restaurant. It is a cozy atmosphere with a small bar, fireplace, some couches, and a few tables to eat at. Their service is always amazing, I've never had a bad experience with a waiter here.   Il Piz has everything to offer for a True Italian girl like myself! Amazing atmosphere, Italian food, and wine!!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place because it had such great reviews and I love wood fired oven/Neapolitan pizza.  But, unfortunately, we were disappointed.  First of all, I just don't understand the design.  I think they are trying to go for a rustic look with the tables that look worn out, but it just looks out of place.  For the menu prices I had higher expectations for how things would look on the inside.  Also, this place is super small and if it's just two of you, expect to be placed at a tiny table.    On to the food.  We had a burrata appetizer special and shared a pizza.  The burrata itself was so good (how could you go wrong with burrata) but its presentation alongside thick slices of undressed tomato and whole basil leaves was strange.  At other wood fires pizza places we have had burrata (priced over $10 cheaper, but I will admit the quality of the burrata itself not as good) which they serve with dressed greens and bread toasted in the wood fired oven.  That's the way to do it - toasted bread is key!  They give everyone a bread basket but the appetizer itself should have been served with bread fresh out of the wood fire oven in my opinion - it would have helped to elevate the burrata even more.  But I did appreciate not having the extra calories and I do love tomatoes.  I still felt like something was missing.   The pizza we shared was the mushroom and it was really disappointing.  The crust was too thick.  We have been to several wood fire oven/Neapolitan  pizza places in a couple different states and one thing they usually all have in common is a thinner crust which I prefer.  I found the pizza to be average in taste too.  :( sad.....and expensive which would have been fine if everything was on point.",

I'm in Mt. Lebanon, and would like my pizza to come sliced.  And by the way, the crust gets soggy even before you slice it yourself, which never used to happen before.

It's worth what you pay, especially for the pizzas and the branzino entree. Having grown up in North Jersey, I've been around good Italian my whole life--and this is good Italian. Worth visiting, worth waiting, worth every penny. The wine bar, while tight, has a cool vibe--It gets very busy on weekends...They also don't take reservations at Lebanon locale, but it's always full on weekends, so I can understand why they don't--There's always someone willing to wait....During the nicer months, its fun to eat outside on their back patio. Get some wine, grab a Peroni, kick back and enjoy.",

    "text": "Editing my review to say that it is not \"good for kids\" as yelp indicates. They have high chairs but no changing tables in the bathrooms. When I asked a hostess about a changing table, she suggested I change my baby on the dirty bathroom floor. That might have just been the one hostess because when I told them there was no way I would put my baby on the dirty bathroom floor to change her, they offered a couch in the bar area to change her on. Also when we were seated, they took us to the very noisy wine bar out back and wanted us to leave our stroller on a different floor. Sorry but we're not leaving our expensive stroller and car seat where we can't even see it. We ended up having to carry the stroller up the stairs and into the back room of the wine bar. Very disappointing because as the rest of my review shows, I love their food and I would love to go back but every time I think of going, I hesitate because of how we were treated last time we went. NOT kid friendly.   Great Italian food! The homemade pasta was so good! My in-laws have Sicilian heritage and the arancini is some of the best they've ever had. We love coming here for the gnocchi, the linguine alla vongole, and the desserts of course. They have a great valpolicella that we always get, but I'm sure their other wines are excellent as well. The ambiance is very cozy too, you feel like you're in Italy. Definitely worth going to this restaurant!",

I lived in Philly for a long time which meant lots of excellent Italian food.  I've had some bad experiences here, so I don't exactly believe people when they tell me a place is great.  Boy was I wrong!  I loved every single dish I had here.  From the perfectly dressed Caesar salad to the magnificent pasta (mine had broccoli rabe and sausage) to the best freaking pizza I've had since moving here.  It was the middle of my work day, but I browsed the wine menu and it was lovely...not to mention the variety of dessert cordials available!  I LOVED it. The location is kind of random for me since I live on the East End, but it was good enough to always be worth a visit when I'm nearby!",

My boyfriend and I went during the busy dinner time ( a little after 6pm) and were greeted and told we could sit at the wine bar for quicker seating. We followed the waitress past the traditional dining area in the front and past the cooking/ dish area to get to the stairs for the wine bar seating. It was much darker inside and somewhat noisy (as a bar typical would be with a TV and dim lights) , but the food is ALWAYS worth the wait.    Overall, 5 star meal. 4 stars only for the walk to get from dining area #1 to #2 .",

The atmosphere was local neighborhood family restaurant. But the menu made me look around to see if we had been transported to Chicgo. The wine list was outstanding with a great variety of Italian vintages by the glass and bottle. We were pressed for time so ordered pizza while reluctantly passing on the longer to prepare Lasagna or Eggplant. All of their foods are prepared from ingredients imported from Italy. The Mahrgarita (sp) pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms was wonderful! As was the Super Tuscan wine. We will be back when we have more time to further explore the menu.",

But the waitress assured me the gnocchi here was homemade and very delicious. I took her advice and was served an incredible plate of melt in your mouth light and puffy clouds of Italian magic! Need I say more? Ok I will....   The sauce also tasted delicious and definitely homemade. I was torn between getting the gnocchi or pasta vodka. I would have been totally satisfied with that choice as well. Thankfully, my friend ordered the pasta vodka and I ws able to steal away a couple bites of it. The sauce was fantastic! It was so creamy and had a hint of Parmesan cheese flavor. Cheese makes EVERYTHING better in my eyes (and mouth)!   Our server was really fantastic and did a great job with input on our meals and also filling us in on some upcoming events. They're having cooking classes and wine pairing nights, which I'm totally into! Such a great way to get people in the door and eating, plus drinking!   Very quaint and cute inside.

I went last Saturday, and although there was a bit of a wait, it is easy to wait when you have a good glass of wine in your hand.  I wish I remembered the name of the appetizer - it was on special and was like caprese but the cheese was more \"buttery.\" I didn't really know what they meant by that when they described it, but after trying it I can say that is a great description. It was delicious. I tried the Prosciutto pizza which was a perfectly baked, authentic Neapolitan pizza. The dough was seasoned well with a sweetness to it that I loved. I also tried the Pollo alla Piccata which was also very good.  All in all, I was very happy with my experience there.",

    "text": "Alright, so I had a mixed experience at II Pizzaiolo. We went here while visiting Pittsburgh to celebrate a birthday.  The restaurant is small, seating is quite close together, and noise level is probably a little high to carry on a meaningful conversation without your table neighbor overhearing all the details.  I think we may have been a bit under dressed. I would say \"snappy casual\" would have appropriate. We were not looking quite that snappy.  Anyway, we ordered an antipasta platter with cured meat, cheese, olives, fava bean spread, and some roasted veggies. Pair that with an excellent bottle of red wine. It was amazing! Surely enough food there for both of us to eat for dinner but we wanted to try the pizza.  Unfortunately, less than 10 min after our huge appetizer came out our server delivered the pizza to our tiny table where there wasn't any more room and we were clearly not ready for the next part of our meal. So, we let the pizza sit there.  When we got ready to eat the pizza it was cold and the crust was rubbery. When our server returned we explained the trouble with the pizza and he promptly got us a fresh one. This was a very nice gesture and promptly rectified the fact he never should have delivered the first one when he did.  The crust on the second pizza was still rubbery. The platter and wine were by far the best part of the meal. Overall the evening was enjoyable but I don't think I would order the pizza again.",

When I looked at the wine list, traditional wines that I would normally order at another restaurant was about 25-40% more, so I stuck with water.  The waiting staff is excellent and know exactly what they're talking about. The ambience is also very nice. At the end of the day though, two meals without any sides, drinks, or any extras cost a whopping $54. The portions were also generally small.

Sound just bounces off the hard walls and makes it very difficult to have a conversation.   But once you taste the pizza none of it matters. The crust is a tiny bit soggy and it doesnt detract from it even a little. The sauce. That sauce. Simple.  Fresh. Mind blowingly delicious as pizza is meant to be. As close to a real deal New York old school pizza as it gets. Dont spoil it with too many toppings. Just try a simple Margherita and see what the fuss is about.",

It's half calzone half margherita pizza and it was killer.  I also got the wedding soup, and that was equally as delicious but that pizza really tied that visit with a delicious little bow. No drinks this time, but the wine selection is great.  It can get a little crowded, so I would try to plan your trip in advance. My husband and I went at like 3 on a Saturday, and we didn't have a wait but people started really coming in as we were leaving around 4ish.",

First, they brought out a large jug of water and glasses along with toasted bread and oil. I ordered the caprese salad, and the tomatoes and mozzarella both tasted extraordinarily fresh. The tomatoes truly tasted like they were freshly picked out of a garden. I also had the margharita pizza and the penne rosa pasta. Both were absolutely outstanding - and vegetarian! The portion sizes were perfect, at the end of my three course dinner I was perfectly stuffed. Overall the food was spectacular, the service was fast and polite, and the location is perfect for an evening date. I will absolutely return soon!",

After tonight's meal, it will definitely not be that long again.   Started off with the anti pasta plate that was so delish that we could have had one for each of us!   White bean dip, peppers, olives, cheese, pepperoni.   For entrees, hubs had the Ragu.  I think he's going to dream about it! I had a few bites and it was soooo scrumptious!   I had the cheese ravioli.  I normally would not order something like that, but the description of it with it being filled with mozzarella made me want to order it.   It was not a wrong decision - they were yummy with the perfect amount (read not a lot) of sauce.  The raviolis were the star, not swimming in sauce.   We were full so got dessert to go ~ cannelloni and a lemon cake.   They look good ... haven't eaten them yet.   To top off the terrific meal was amazing service by Jess.    Believe me, it will be a few weeks and we will return ~ not years!!",

Portion looked small for the price ($21!!) but I guess gnocchi is super filling so it was okay. Waiter was polite and patient with our large crowd.

We were sharing a chicken dish, the plate was dropped in the middle of the table. No one asked if we needed some plates, the server never stopped by to offer plates. Checking in to see how things are going is not done. Dirty dishes and empty glasses were never cleared. Asking if you'd like another round of drinks is not included. You have to flag the server down and then your wine never comes. We had to share a knife throughout the meal, even though we asked for a replacement. When a restaurant is charging a premium, you expect premium service, not worse than you get at Olive Garden.   The pizza is not that great. One piece of basil on an entire margarita pizza is ridiculous. The crust was thick and doughy, not thin and crispy as you would expect from a wood-fired pizza.   The manager is completely clueless and only served to make our experience worse, rather than better. We were refused dessert and left feeling sufficiently punished for voicing our feelings about the service.",

    "text": "I found this restaurant featured on the Top Restaurants in Pittsburgh 2016 and figured I should give it a go!  Let me start by saying if you are going to eat here, sit outside. The patio has a cozy, romantic feel with brick floors and trees with lights through out them. It is a perfect place for a date night.   My boyfriend started out with a golden monkey and I ordered a peach bellini. My drink was ordinary- nothing to rave about or get again, but not terrible.   The bread and oil beforehand was alright. The bread seemed like it was not made in house and we were not given more than a tablespoon of plain dipping oil for two people. I would have liked to have seen homemade bread and oil with spices and/or vinegar in it.   We forewent an appetizer (which was a mistake since our food took a little bit to come out) and decided upon the salsiccia e rapini pizza and pollo marsala. The pizza came out blazing out. When we were finally able to try it, we both agreed that it was flavorful yet we have had better pizza elsewhere. The pollo marsala on the other hand was out of this world amazing. It was be difficult to come back and not get this every single time.   The reason for the star deduction was due to three  things. The service was suboptimal- our waitress was not very present and seemed to be spending a lot of time at tables near us instead. I was also disappointed in the experience as a whole due to the positive reviews I have read. Lastly, it was a bit pricey- one round of drinks was over $20 and the (small) pizza was $19.",

The wine bar is hidden in the back area and it is such a nice place to visit during the week.  Don't even try to go there on the weekends... too crowded. In the summer, sitting outside is such a luxury.  Order the Rigatoni alla Siciliana.  Perfecto!",

    "text": "Great little place in downtown Mt Lebanon. My mother and aunt live in Mt. Lebanon and my husband and I visit a couple times a year, and on a night we had to ourselves decided to have a late dinner here.As it was a Saturday, the place was packed and had a couple groups waiting. Because we were only needing a table for 2 we were able to get seated promptly.  This was one of the evenings when the daytime temperature was over 100 degrees and was still very hot after sundown; the restaurant was boiling hot. They have a wood burning pizza oven so I am sure that they cannot keep the place as cool as some eateries (most are too cold for me). Service was very fast and very attentive, and very nice. We had cold water on our table in under 30 seconds of seating, were given just the right amount of time to look at the menu, and received our appetizer within 10 minutes of seating. Our food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering, with enough time to not be rushed through our appetizer.  I cannot remember what our appetizer's name was, but it was a dough pocket filled with mozzarella and had yellow and red tomatoes to the side. It was well done, but I felt like it was simply too huge a portion to really be an appetizer/salad. Giant mound of mozzarella + only 4 thin slices of tomatoes seemed off somehow; still tasted great though. My husband had Linguini alle Vongole- clams in a white sauce. He absolutely loved the meal, and the dish arrived with more clams than I would ever have expected.  I ordered Chicken Piccata, as I was wanting something lighter than pasta or anything packed with cheese. The lemon was so refreshing and the sauce done very nicely- not too buttery, with more of the lemon and wine coming through- definitely nice after such a seething hot day. The quality of the food shines through, even from the menu. I appreciate a place that used San Marzano tomatoes, real buffalo mozzarella, huge sprigs of basil, , etc. The prices were a little steep but I didn't leave the place lamenting over the cost. The last comment I will leave is that the place is ungodly loud when full. Now, I am not a local, and I have always noticed that in general Pittsburgh restaurants are much louder than what I am used to (San Fransisco CA, Louisville KY, Washington DC, Baltimore MD and Philly). I usually chalk it up to a Pittsburgh thing, but this place was wayyyy louder for whatever reason. There was one group of maybe 10 (noise wasn't so much from them anyway) people but otherwise all small groups. I say this merely b/c a couple people have said it's a great date spot. I would agree, but NOT FOR A FIRST or any getting-to-know-you dates- you won't hear half of what your date said and who wants to have to scream so everyone around you knows it's a first date? :)  Overall, a great restaurant and I cannot wait to come back try their DOC pizza- it looked superb.",

    "text": "WTF?  How does this place get so highly rated on Yelp?  It's not awful, but it was one of the most mediocre brick-oven pizzas I've ever eaten.  There's much better \"fancy\" pizza in Pittsburgh, and much better regular pizza, too.    The antipasto plate was good, but definitely not worth the $15 they charge for it.  Decor's not bad, but the space is a little noisy; service was pretty average, below what I'd expect for a $15/person place.    Long story short: unless you're in the neighborhood, you can get better Italian elsewhere in the 'burgh.  P.S. This is yet another Pittsburgh establishment that doesn't take credit cards.  Seriously, is the whole city in a 1995 time warp?  (...Or are all of these places just cheating on their tax bills?  It's a lot harder to hide check and credit card transactions from an auditor.  With cash, you just need to hide a few receipts.)",

I'm vegan and so is my bf so we were already limited in choices, the Napoli antipasto is awesome but our entree left much to be desired. I forget the exact name but it was basically a spaghetti w pomodoro sauce. I can't believe they charge $16 for this dish! It was cold and not a good portion. I got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip. I love spicy stuff too! Just not a good value for the $. I just moved back from nyc and my fav place there charges significantly less for significantly more. I'm so disappointed bc this was one of my go to places in Pgh! :/",

    "text": "The BEST pizza. Pizza that while eating makes you feel like you're in another country. The first bite was absurdly amazing...I wasn't expecting my taste buds to explode with delight. And the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy. The flavor of the pizza is completely different than any of our chains and independent pizza places (whose pizza I also love...this pizza is just different). I would recommend getting the pizzas with their sauce because some of the pizzas on the menu don't come with sauce and their sauce is probably what makes the pizza so good. I mean, the crust is special and the topping ingredients are fresher & a better quality than other pizza places...but the sauce has all the flavor.   The other food we had was good, but it pales in comparison. I had the mistacanza (spelling i'm not so sure on) salad, which was just ok (I would skip it next time). My boyfriend ordered one of the paninis which was pretty large & had a lot of meat and cheese, but I doubt it was nearly as good as the pizza (the pizza was finished, half the panini went home). The menu had a lot of homemade pastas, which we didn't try but are probably great. The other standout part of our meal was the complimentary bread & olive oil served at the start...the olive oil was fantastic tasting, much better than any other restaurant I've been to in the past few years and one of the breads (it was buttery & had coarse salt on the top) was delicious.   The only warning I have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes. The bottom of the menu does say \"please no substitutions\" but they really mean it...as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza (an easy & normal request at most places) and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don't like to change their dishes. So if you have kids or picky eaters with you, beware that you might not get your way.",

It's rare to find a True D.O.C. certified pizza but they've taken all the steps to make it happen. Everything else I've tried on the well-rounded (but not too long) menu is terrific as well. Very focused wine list--all Italian and perfectly matched to the food. My only complaint is that the place is so popular now that it can be very crowded at peak hours and loud in the main room. I've never had to wait very long for a seat, but sometimes there is a wait. Try to hit it in the mid-afternoon for a more quiet experience. And definitely stick your head in the upstairs wine bar even if you're not eating there. It's such a cosy place you won't want to leave.",

    "text": "Heard  GREAT things about this place.  What a let down it was.  Made reservations for our Anniversary and showed up on time.  Early evening on a Friday night. We ordered the ravioli and a personal pizza.......it took 47 MINUTES for our food to come out !!!    I was counting. Because it was rediculous. The restaraunt was half empty, and we sat there for 47 minutes with a little bread and oil--wich they refilled twice because the food was taking so long.  AND NEVER refilled our empty water glasses.  I decided at 50 minutes we were leaving.  Lo and behold at 47 minutes it comes out. Bland and soggy as we've ever tasted.  Opposite of what we expected from such an \"upscale\" Italian dining experience.    They never apologized for the long wait for our food and pretended everything was normal and fine.  We scarfed it down in a hurry to leave and asked for the bill. The waitress put it on the table and then took almost 10 minutes more to return to charge it when we were obviously packed up and ready to go.  We just walked up to the register and had someone else nearby handle it for us.  My husband went to pull the car around while I finished up with the bill.    Look, I know these are first world problems, and truthfully, my husband and I always enjoy each others company so much that we hardly notice a long wait for our food... PLUS... we were there on a gift card....     But we were trying to make it to a show that night and ended up arriving late and all for a meal that kinda sucked.  Even worse, when my husband and I got up to leave, a table of 2 next to us received their food---- they had only been seated 15 minutes earlier!!!!  I never complain about waitstaff mostly because I used to be a waitress, but what pushed me so far as to get on yelp about it is what I witnessed on the way out the door.  While I was standing by the door waiting for them to charge our card, A very elderly woman whom I had noticed was standing there a long time, asked the hostess...\"how much longer for a table?\"  and the hostess said...\"About 20 more minutes\".  The elderly woman replied..\"Thats what you said 20 minutes ago, and I see 5 empty tables.\"  The hostess got very rude with her and retorted \"Ma'am, some people plan ahead and make reservations, and its impossible to tell you the exact amount of time you will need to wait because we dont know how much longer people will be staying. They might order dessert, or more drinks. You can go to another establishment.\"  Seeing this old woman as I would my own grandmother, I stuck my neck out and spoke up to the hostess.   I said...\"Listen, I've noticed this woman standing here a very long time.  You don't have any chairs for people up here to sit in and wait, so shes just been standing here. If you told her the wait was going to be 20 minutes, you need to seat her after 20 minutes.  If you were'nt sure exactly how long the wait would be, you should have told her that in the first place instead of getting angry at her for going by what YOU SAID.  Also, it would'nt hurt to show a little more respect to your elders.\"    The hostess looked at her friend and rolled her eyes sarcasticly as to say...\"who is this bi***?\"  hahahaha.  VERY RUDE. VERY.   WORST SERVICE IN YEARS. SORRY.   Dishonorable staff.  Unimpressive food.",

Check out the patio in the summer time.  I used to live in Lebo and miss this place since moving to Charlotte, NC over four years ago.  I stop at Il Pizzaiolo every time I am back in town.

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Supposedly, they have an extensive Italian beer selection and a wood-fired oven, so off my hubby and I went. I looked over the menu and discovered they only had two (2) Italian beers (Moretti, Peroni). Disappointed but not giving up, we ordered one of each and proceeded. The waiter (Adam) comes over and tells about the specials before leaving again so we have time to make a choice. FYI - the wait staff tries to class up the place by acting as if they've lived in Italy and personally prepared the food so we played along. We ordered a few appetizers to try, salads, and I ordered a Pizza Margherita and my hub-a-bub ordered a Calzone. After we order, Adam brings us some squares of wood fired bread with EVOO. The bread was thick and doughy (clearly a filler). Then comes the appetizers along with the salads. We ordered Rice Balls (both cheese and cheese and meat), which had *no* flavor. We also ordered the the Potato Croquettes, which tasted *sour*. The salads looked fresh but was all green until you dug down to the bottom of the plate where there were two small pieces of red and orange pepper, a cherry tomato, and an olive. Said salad would have been really tasty, had the vinaigrette not been too sweet. Next came the entrees. The place is suppose to be known for their pizzas (that Adam said was a thin crust personalized pizza) but what I was served was a big blob of pizza dough with some cheese and sauce on top. My hub-a-bub's Calzone was a huge blob of thinly stuffed dough with some cheese and sauce on top. Clearly these folks haven't been to Italy or know what True Neapolitan Pizza looks like. Needless to say, I couldn't bring myself to touch or eat what amounted to a loaf of bread (aka an Il Pizzaiolo Pizza) but paid for it anyway. A $100 later, we would have been much happier, and better off to stay at home enjoying a good red wine, a fresh loaf of Italian bread, and a hunk of Parma cheese!      Later that evening, my iron stomach started to gurgle. Needless to say, I ended up riding the porcelain bus in one bathroom, with my hub-a-bub in the other, for the rest of the evening.  All I can say if you eat there, be ready for a bumpy ride. Happy eating!",

    "text": "I have been to Il Piz several times overthe past few years and I have yet to be impressed. Don't get me wrong, the food has always been good, but not fantastic and a little over priced. Yes, I've had the pizza. Yes, I've had several pasta dishes. None of which has changed my mind. I don't understand why there is always such a long wait for a table here.  My latest trip was on a warm Saturday night. I met a few friends on the patio for dinner. I arrived a llittle late and with baby in tow. I specifically asked for them to order me a glass of wine so it was on the table when I arrived. Unfortunately, for my dining companion, I miscalculated the size of baby + diaper bag and knocked over the glass of wine spilling it all over his yellow shirt. It almost looked like a tie dyed effect. The wait staff rushed to our side bringing him a glass of seltzer water and me a new glass of wine (I later found out at no charge). Seltzer water had nothing on the masterpeice I created. The shirt was officially retired. Once we got settled, I ordered the insalata misticanza. Despite the fancy name, it's a rather typical salad with balsamic, greens and some typical veggies. Nothing extravagant here, especially for 11$. For my entree, I had the fusilli ala ragu di bracioli. The pasta was cooked well. The beef was a little dry. The sauce was ok. I decided to not take home my left overs. Overall, my bill ended up being 40$. For a salad, pasta dish and 1 glass of wine. This same meal would average at least 5 dollars less at an equivalent restaurant. The best thing about the meal was the service. The server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. Overall, I will most likely go back to Il Piz because it is such a staple in the South Hills area, though it would not be by my choice.",

    "text": "PLEASE take heed of the many warnings on this website.  I too once loved this restaurant, but we have had far too many terrible experiences to ever return.  Our first bad experience was a year and a half ago.  My parents were visiting from out of town and my husband and I decided to take them here.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes.  We were lucky enough to find two seats at the wine bar so we could share a bottle of vino and take turns sitting.  An hour went by... then an hour and fifteen minutes... We began to notice that some parties coming into the bar area after us were seated before us.  Then, we were finally told our table was ready and to follow them... only for one of the hostesses to stop the waitress who was seating us.  She told the waitress that the table was for someone else.  We then watched as they sat a party who had been waiting for less than 20 minutes.  I can only presume these people were friends with one of the hostesses.  At this point, over 90 minutes had passed and we were understandably upset.  I complained to the manager, a middle aged woman who showed absolutely no concern for the situation they had caused.  We should have left, but instead we ordered another bottle and waited another 20 minutes for our table in the extremely noisy front dining room.  My husband absolutely refused to go to this location after that incident, so our next incident was not until this past week.  We made reservations for a Friday night and I specifically requested a quiet table in the wine room if one was available.  I noted that we would be willing to switch our reservation to a half hour before or after if that gave us a better chance, knowing they can't completely control such things.  When we arrived, the hostesses appeared to be the same teenage or 20-something girls who worked here a year ago.  I don't know if they were or if this restaurant simply has a steady stream of insolent young girls from which to draw.  The girls looked at each other, continued to giggle and continue whatever conversations they had already been having, and eventually pulled out a couple menus for us.  They led us to a table for 8 which already had 4 people.  They then gestured towards the table and asked \"is this okay?\".  We responded that no, we had made a reservation and there were at least two open tables in the front dining room, so we expected to be sat there, outside or at the wine bar (we checked - there was a table open in the same room as the wine bar and one outside).  The girl then informed us that it would be another 20-30 minutes if we didn't want to sit at someone else's table.  I have never known Il Pizzaiolo to be communal seating so this was completely unacceptable.  We left and gave our business to another restaurant on the same street, where we had excellent food and excellent service.   This portion is regarding the other location downtown:  Our third bad experience was the Market Square location this past Sunday.  We have had one less than favorable experience there before (they told my husband and I it would be a 2 hour wait for a table for 8, then told someone else from our party it would be 15 minutes only 10 minutes later... ), but we were willing to justify it and hoped it was an anomaly.  Sadly, they now seem to hire from the same pool as the Mt. Lebanon location.  We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for an outdoor table as 3 different 4 tops were finishing their dinner.  They said they would call us so we took a walk and returned 15 minutes later.  We waited at a public table in Market Square and WATCHED as the host and hostess cleared and then sat the 2 of the 4 tops.  When we went in to ask what was going on, we saw that all three 4 tops were actually resat.  We reminded them we were waiting and asked them when they would have our table ready.  We were told it would be another 20 minutes.  Goodbye!  Ciao, Il Pizzaiolo!  Never again.  We were able to be seated at Sienna immediately.    Ownership should be ashamed.  I don't know whether it is nepotism in the host positions or a complete lack of respect for their clientele.  I should add that on every occasion, a remark was made to at least a hostess, if not management, and no one offered even a sincere apology.  It is sad that people are willing to put up with this level of service.  There are plenty of other fine establishments in Pittsburgh, particularly Italian ones.  I have a whole list of Italian restaurants that have as good or better food, that would never treat their patrons like this.",

Here's what you need to know: This is the most authentic pizza in Pittsburgh. Hands down. There are NO other contenders. In fact, this is the ONLY place in Pennsylvania that is VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana)-certified to make a True DOC pizza, so it's not really a debatable point.  If you don't like authentic pizza, fine (but I think you're insane). For me, having the most authentic pizza also means they make the best pizza. DOC margherita pizza is one of my favorite foods in the world, and I ate it at least once a week when I was living in Florence. Il Pizzaiolo is very, very, very close to the real thing in Italy. If you call yourself a pizza snob, you need to get here, order a DOC margherita with mozzarella di bufala, and maybe a rucola e proscuitto while you're at it. You can thank me later.  The pasta is also excellent, but not as good as Dish in the South Side so I only order it if I'm with a group. Pizza, though. Mmmmm...",

I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return.",

A first timer, I was told that Il Pizzaiolo is one of a handful of pizzerias in the country certified to make authentic Neapolitan pizza.  In addition, their amazing mozzarella is flown in directly from Naples! We tried the Caprese salad (absolute heaven-- the mozzarella really makes this dish) and the Diavola pizza (spicy salumi,mozzarella, and a spicy, salty tomato sauce).  The waiter was kind enough to show us the backseat outdoor patio, which we will certainly visit the next time we're here, as well as their back lounge, which was equipped with comfy couches and a bar if you're interested in a nightcap after dinner. I'm excited to go back and try their pasta!",

    "text": "Il Pizz....to my entourage and I is a great corner stone of the MTL dining scene. Every dish I have ever had here has been nothing but excellent.   I can really appreciate the effort that this place puts into its products. If they have their homemade burrata, which has such a nice mellow flavor and texture of silk, I recommend giving it a try. If you have never had it before, it is very runny and creamy so don't be alarmed that is how it is supposed to be. They serve it with a simple side of Heirloom tomato slices with a bit of salt and pepper which makes this a refreshing summer appetizer.   I can't write enough to describe everything I have tried on their menu but most recently I had one of their many styles of pizza. The Funghi pizza had a most flavorful sauce and with tasty mushroom, mozz cheese, basil. It is cooked in a wood fired oven and fresh ingredients make these rather simple pies, gourmet.   The drink menu is vast with many tasty wines and beers, domestic and imported. I agree with some other reviews that the drink prices are a little on the steep side but I think it makes up for the more than reasonable food prices. I think that the most inexpensive wine on the list is $9 a glass.   The service is usually excellent although I have had extremely long wait times which I think is caused by the fact that this is a great place that draws plenty of people in and many folks enjoy hanging out after dinner since the ambiance is pretty nice. I have also had them tell me the wait was almost 2 hours and was seated in 20 minutes???? Don't understand that one. I recommend in the summer months seeing if you can grab a seat on their back patio and I also enjoy dining in their back dinning room (wine bar) as it is usually a little quieter and intimate feeling than the front dining area. Take some time and enjoy the experience.",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me with an early Valentine's Day dinner tonight at Il Pizzaiolo.  Neither of us had ever been before and after tonight's experience, it would be beyond fair to say we will be coming back pretty regularly.  With not much standing room to wait, without being in the way, we wound up waiting outside between the restaurant and wine bar for about 45 minutes or so for a table.  The hostess was amazing, despite the long (but completely worthwhile) wait.  She kept us updated if she happened by and found us a cozy spot in the main restaurant.  Neither of us realized we would be taken care of by a wonderful server, whom the rest of the staff kept referring to as one of the best ever.  Emily gave us suggestions, knowing that we this was our first visit and answered every menu question we had.  She gave us extra info on the dishes we ordered and never left us waiting for anything we asked for.  We started with an order of the meatballs and a caprese salad.  Everything we ordered had much fancier names than I'm remembering, so please excuse that lol.  Both appetizers were incredible.  I generally have to add salt when I order a caprese salad but there was no need this time.  Both appetizers were impeccably seasoned and delicious.  For entrees, we had a pasta sausage and rapini dish...as well as a house made tortelloni, stuffed with mascarpone cheese and spinach.  There are not words to describe how much we both enjoyed our entrees.  Again, everything was perfectly seasoned and sauced just right.  To finish, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the most decadently light lemon pastry cake I've ever had.  The saddest part of the meal was when it was over.  This is one of the longest reviews I've ever written and if you made it to the end, thank you lol.  The food was epic and Emily is truly amazing.  Give this place a try ASAP!!!",

    "text": "The perfect date night location! It's not a huge place so when you get there, there is a high chance you will have to wait awhile to be seated. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. Head to the back, go out the door, and go up the stairs of the building behind it. They have a small bar and waiting area by the fire place where you can have a drink and chat in the meantime. This cute little area was definitely my favorite part of the visit. We waited about an hour to be seated so we were definitely hungry by the time our food came. I got the gnocchi sorrentina. It was very good but I wish there would have been more protein on it. We left very satisfied with the experience. If you give this place a try, I recommend getting there earlier in the evening to avoid waiting for a long time.",

    "text": "Overall, not what I expected. No reservations are taken here, which is unusual, but we were seated immediately ~ 7:30pm -- however the minute I took my coat off I realized I couldn't bear the cold, outside draft moving through the restaurant. Looks like perhaps the front door doesn't close/seal entirely. I don't get cold easily, but I wore my coat until about half way through dinner, until the wine could warm me up. Restaurant is trendy, unique, and aesthetically cozy, but 3 stars on the cold atmosphere. In terms of service, it was 3 stars at best. The place just seemed to be in disarray. We had to ask for water, twice... replacement silverware, twice...  extra plates, twice...we also wanted to order a bottle of wine, so sampled a few -- but the samples looked more like the minuscule amount of wine that you leave in your glass when you've finished. When we decided on a bottle, the server poured me another drip to taste.... so i politely asked for a bit more to truly taste it. All in all, the server was very kind, but I think they were suffering from a general snafu around the restaurant. I also think the wine education could be improved with the servers! Actual wine was great ! The Arancini was also a great appetizer for the table. However, following we were told that our dinner check had been lost and we were asked to re-verify our order. It happens, but from there it took awhile to get our food. Tables who sat after us were served first. Following that our both of our table's pizzas came out undercooked and doughy.  It wasn't unbearable, but I certainly wasn't going to send it back after everything we had been through. With that said, i did try some pasta, sausage, and meatball from my friends dish -- the meatballs were on-point and amazing.  I'd come back, but not rushing to do so.",

It was a Saturday night and we had a 25 min wait, but were directed to the cozy wine bar which had a nice fireplace where we could wait and had an awesome wine selection. We then ordered wedding soup, lemon chicken, and sausage pizza. All of the food was fantastic. Bread and oil comes with the food. The oil was not very good in our opinion so that would be the only downside. Staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our service. The ambiance was very nice and relaxing. Perfect for our anniversary dinner.",

We started off with bread and oil and then ordered the prosciutto e arugula pizza and the gnocchi sorrentina for the two of us.   The food came pretty quickly. Also the diet coke was served in a cute little glass bottle. We started off with the pizza, which looked and tasted amazing. It was a white pizza, with cherry tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, parmesan, topped with arugula and prosciutto. It was fresh, delicious, and had a great combination of textures and flavors between the crunchy arugula and softer prosciutto. Hands down one of the best pizzas I have had in Pittsburgh. The gnocchi was also perfectly cooked. Each one was a little pocket of joy especially with the fresh mozzarella. The sauce could have been a little more flavorful but the handmade gnocchi made up for it.   For desert, we had the cannoli. It was definitely big enough to split with one end being dusted in pistachio and the other end covered in mini chocolate chips. The cannoli cream filling was decadent and I just wanted to keep on eating it. Overall, had a lovely meal here and will be back. Everything was made perfectly and tasted authentic.",

    "text": "I should start by saying I normally love this place.  That's about the only positive thing I have to say today, though.  Caesar salad for lunch in Uptown Mt. Lebo - that's all I wanted.  Seems easy enough, right?  Only one place to get it that was local and easy (not cheap).  I'm pretty excited, because it's like 1:30 pm and the lunch rush should be over.  So, I get the ball rolling.  I call Il Pizzaiolo; no answer.  Call again; no answer.  Third time, someone picks up.  I order my caesar salad with chicken.  I'm told 30 minutes (30 minutes to chop some lettuce and grate some cheese?  Pretty sure the chicken was already ready to go.  Neat.).  Fast forward 30 minutes: walk down the street (10 minute walk) and pick up my [$17] salad [that probably cost $3 to make].  Walk 10 minutes back to the office.  Get everything ready to eat... but that's when it hits me.  NO DRESSING.  A caesar salad without dressing is just chopped up lettuce and chicken.  Or, a chicken salad, if you will.  I didn't order a sad chicken salad, did I?  Nope.  So I figure ok, fine.  Things happen.  I'll call them and see if they can just have the dressing ready for me to grab.  So I call - no one answers.  Call again - \"Il Pizzaiolo, can you hold please?\"  Sure.  Sure I can.  2 minutes.  5 minutes. 7 minutes.  I've already started walking back at this point.  10 minutes.  11 minutes.  I walk in, still on hold and there are 2 people at the register.  They look at me.    I let them know I picked up my caesar salad (20 minutes ago, at this point) and there was no dressing in it.  Then I showed them my phone and asked if anyone needed to pick up the caller on hold.  I could see the red light blinking (for anyone who isn't following along: I was still on hold).  \"Who put you on hold?!?!\"  Lady, I don't work here.    Other guy goes to kitchen.  Gets dressing.  Comes back.  \"Sorry, I dunno what happened there.\"  Well, friend, if you have the time - I wrote it all out for you to review, on Yelp.  Have at it.  Did I mention I'm 7 months pregnant, and it's my birthday?  (I couldn't make this up if I tried.)  Xo.",

    "text": "Everyone I know says Il Pizzaiolo in Mount Lebanon has the best Italian in Pittsburgh, even when compared to the downtown location. From my experience at the two locations, I find it difficult to compare the two directly because they're quite different in some ways. The menus aren't exactly the same and the ambience is a complete 180. The Mt. Lebo location is quaint and is decorated in warm colors, making it feel like you're in Italy.   When my husband and I came here, we ordered the Arancini, Pollo Marsala, and Gnocchi Sorrentina. The bread they serve is their pizza dough, which was quite nice! For the arancini, we ordered two meat and two cheese. I would say the cheese were far better so I recommend getting four cheese ones. They were served in marinara sauce which made it even better. Both our entrees were delicious. The chicken marsala was so moist and flavorful, while the gnocchi were light and fluffy. Just an FYI, all their pastas are made in-house except the spaghetti, rigatoni, and penne. Maybe the linguine too, but I don't quite remember that detail.   I personally would prefer this location to the downtown location, as I much prefer the quiet atmosphere here.",

    "text": "After living in Italy for 7 months during my college years I can say that I have a voice in the discussion of what first-rate Italian should taste like. Just so you all know I have tried almost every dish on the menu but will stick to what in my opinion is the best. I did not leave 5 stars because I do think it is a bit overpriced. The last time I went my server was really impatient and snobby when I was asking questions and trying to decide on the wine.  I arrived before the dinner rush on my birthday so I could take the time to really dine with my boyfriend.   Why I crave Pizzaiolo? Mozzarella di bufala. I know for a fact that every Thursday they fly in many choice ingredients directly from Italia. This creamy delicacy is by far my best loved. It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy.  The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra. Full bodied, spicy, splashes of berry, and low in tannins.   As for the pizza, it is reminiscent of the famous brick oven pizzas of Da Michele found in only Napoli. The crust is extremely thin, light. and crispy. Follow that with my \"Piece de resistance\" mozzarella di bufala, tangy san marzano tomato sauce, and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more. (yes I know that reference is french) So mangia bene at Il Pizzaillo",

The food is always amazing, but you're probably going to wait a little bit for a table - especially if you want to sit outside on the patio, which I absolutely recommend. While you're waiting check out the quaint wine bar in the back. Servers are knowledgeable and attentive. Overall a great place to enjoy authentic Italian cuisine.",

My friend and I ordered the rice/risotto stuffed with mozarella appetizer (don't rememeber the name) and the Margherita Pizza - it was sooo good.  It's exactly what I wanted and everything was served hot and fresh.    The pizza was thin and delightfully tasteful - no one flavor really overpowered another.  And I'll tell you what, I'm not a big pizza crust eater, I actually haven't eaten the crust of a pizza for years - well that infamous night at Il Pizzaiola put a stop to that trend.  I ate every piece of that pizza slice including the crust.    If your in the mood for pizza check this place out!  It was a bit pricey just for pizza, but I thought it was worth it.",

Portions were generous and the food was excellent. The eggplant parmesean was the best I have had and rather than the frequently found thin slices of breaded eggplant, this dish had nice thick slices with fresh mozzarella and basil. In addition to a great wine list they also had some unique beer selections. Although we did not try them, the brick oven pizzas also looked worth trying. Service was very attentive. We would return in a heartbeat.",

Casual, but trendy, restaurant that was the perfect little date night.  The wine menu was good - and the server helped us pick out a few based on our tastes.  The food was VERY good. We had the Polpettini (mini meatballs) as an appetizer and they were all gone in about 5mins.  We shared two entrees: the DOC margherita pizza and a pasta special of the evening - penne with a lamb ragu.  The pizza... the pizza... the pizza.... I could eat the entire thing by myself. I forgot about the pasta, and to be honest, it couldn't stand up to the pizza.  This 5 star rating is absolutely for the best margherita pizza I've ever had - and thanks Misty for the awesome rec!",

    "text": "Full review with pictures in blog:   Greeted by our server, a friendly college age girl with an ever-present smile, our waters were filled and menus presented while we were left time to decide - time that would be welcome given the large size of the menu and the fact that I would have liked to try at least thirty items.  Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing process of deciding which option sounded best.    Baked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  With each bread a great example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.  Beginning the meal as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.   An ample portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge the plate clean of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.  Selecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right.  Complimenting the pasta were sweet and snappy peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  All balanced by a somewhat sweet cream sauce the entire dish was well thought out, well balanced, and divine.  Not to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us fighting for the last dumpling.  Simply prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet and aromatic sauce.  Topped with a quick grating of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best I've ever tasted-a skilled hand, perfect cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.  Enjoying all the previous efforts so much the \"star\" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super sweet tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice compliment of flavor.  Arriving quickly and in ample portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard example with buttery lady fingers, smooth mascarpone, high quality cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced with the rum soaking the bottom layer and cream dominating the top.  Significantly more impressive was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, and authentic.  Great service, everything expertly prepared, and prices that fit the quality of the ingredients I was very happy with every aspect of our meal.  Honestly, when the pizza, one of the best I've ever had was the \"worst\" savory...that is saying something.  Clearly I need to start paying attention to that Verace Pizza Napoletana Association list when I travel.",

    "text": "Mt. Lebanon is such a cute little town! I was so happy we chose to eat dinner there, especially when we got a great, people-watching table right next to the window. Very relaxing before our 5-hour drive home the next day.  Il Pizzaiolo has a great, rustic atmosphere. Dark wood, tan walls, delicious pizza smells. And a full bar. Very important.  The service was eh. It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, another 5 to get drinks and tepid water for the table. (Ew, chill the water. I know you're going for a Euro atmosphere but you're not in Europe. Chill the damn water.) The appetizer got there after another 5 and then the pizza took forever. I don't know how since the menu claims they're cooked in 30 seconds in the wood burning oven. But no matter. On to the review.  T got a beer and I got a mimosa. They were out of the peach juice that usually goes in a mimosa so it was made with blood orange juice instead. Delicious.   For our appetizer we ordered a sort of potato stick with cheese mixed in. Forget the exact name and they don't seem to have a website where I can check. They were ... okay. A bit bland truth be told but the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top helped a bit. There was no salt and pepper on the table and our waitress was a bit absent so we sucked it up and ate the bland potato stick things.  However, the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer. We got the Diavolo with spicy salami and chili flakes. Amazing. The crust was thin and chewy and not too black on the bottom. The cheese was salty and creamy and the salami was spicy and really tasty. Much better than pepperoni in my opinion.  I suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian. I'm sure there are better in the Pittsburgh area.",

I liked the design of this place as it's very clean and has a comfortable vibe. I also like how you can see the brick oven and some of the food being made. I wanted lasagna but it wasn't offered on the lunch menu but the server was happy to still offer it to me but with mentioning that it will take some extra time to prepare. I wasn't worried about the wait. I started with the deep fried risotto balls 2 meat and 2 cheese. I have to admit they where outstanding and loaded with flavor. As for the bread it was good but the oil for dipping was absolutely terrible and completely flavorless. Now for the lasagna it was a smaller portion then you would expect but it had decent flavor and the sauce was great. It wasn't really loaded up with sausage and meatballs but overall I enjoyed it as I'm not a big lover of Italian food. I could definitely see my self returning here to try other items on the menu.",

We where seated by 1 of 2 hosts, walked through the restaurant  and was greeted with hello's from 6 staff members. Seated outside, I took a pic of a table with a glass still with wine and plates/ not ours. We where seated at 4:25. I was excited, hungry, and ready for our dinner date to begin. I wanted the  VONGOLE POSILLIPO:  Fresh Manilla Clams, Garlic, Oil, White Wine, San Marzano D.O.P. Tomatoes To start.  Unfortunately we where not allowed to even begin the meal. No server came to us. Not to provide us with water. Not to speak to us about the specials. Not even to ask if we would like a glass or bottle of wine. NOTHING!!!! A busboy was seen, he cleaned up the table I had took a picture of earlier. After 25 minutes... I remind you, 6 staff members said hello as we where being seated, I said that's it. We walked back the way we came, where told goodbye by all the same people as we walked to the host/ bar in the front and handed our menus back to them. They asked if we enjoyed everything. I told them, \"NEVER AGAIN will I spend money or step foot in thus place again! No-one came to serve us...25 minutes, and NOTHING!!!!\" The hostess said \"Are you serious?\"   Quick note, there was one customer inside this entire time so its not like we lost in the crowd.  Service was non-existent so I cannot rate the food at this time.   We left still hungry walked across the street and ate at Totopo   That was great, Taco Tuesday!!! Great service, great Mexican food and overall a save to our night.   \"NEVER AGAIN will I spend money or step foot in thus place again!

I used to tell people to go, now I doubt if I'll ever head back unless for take out.  \"Hello, my name is Bailey and I'll be taking care of you tonight.\" That was the first sign of horrendous service.  When a server uses generic statements, you know it's going to be bad.  \"Do you want anything to drink other than water?\"  Oh crap, it's all gone done hill quickly.  \"We'll have a bottle of Etna Rosso, please!\"  10 minutes go by before a glass was put on the table.    \"Do you know what you want to eat?\" We ordered two salads to share, a pizza to share and three pastas to share.  The wine finally comes!    The wine service:  Bailey may need training on this aspect of service.  First, she didn't present the bottle. Just came to the table and proceeded to open it. She cut the foil off and was perplexed to find the wax ring and tried to cut it out. Next she broke the cork while trying to pull it out.  No big deal, but awkward nonetheless.  She finally opens the bottle and pours the wrong person.  Tip: pour the person who ordered the wine.  Then she topped off the person she poured first. Another error.   Salads come out and were pretty good.  Anchovies were quite nice.  Empty salad plates sit on the table for a good ten minutes as we finish our wine. Now empty wine glasses sit on the table. Bailey is nowhere to be seen.  We flag down another server and ask for a wine menu. He brings it promptly.    We flag down Bailey and order a Montepulciano.   Five to ten minutes go by and the food comes out.. all of it at once.  You'd think they would course it out first. Maybe the pizza followed by the pastas. Nope. Everything at once.  The pastas are all very nice and the pizza was quite good.  Where's the wine we ordered 15 minutes ago?  We're almost through the food and decided to cancel the wine order.   I put this whole experience not on Bailey, but on the management of il Pizz.  Obviously, our server wasn't trained to serve at a somewhat upscale restaurant.    I don't really recommend this place after this experience.  Go next door if you'd like better food with excellent service.",

Much better than the location in Market Square but not the high level that they once were.  My last visit I had the cappelletti and the sage/butter/tomato mix tasted sour. Prior to that on another visit the gnocchi that was once triumphant in the land of restaurants claiming to make it homemade  actually had a frozen taste to it. I feel like they still make it onsite but freeze and perhaps I had an older batch.   Not sure I'll trek back out to my old stomping grounds of Mt. Lebo for this place any time soon.",

We ordered a montaro pizza (similar to the margherita but with thicker crust), vodka penne, and two margherita pies. The margherita pizza is Il Pizzaiolo's bread and butter - I could have eaten my weight in margherita pizza. Word to the wise: an adult (and most kids these days) can easily eat a pizza themselves. We finished up dinner with tiramisu and cannoli. I'm not a fan of cannoli but the tiramisu was fantastic.  The wine selection is large and beer options surprising. Our server, Lauren, was very knowledgeable and helped guide some of our table's decisions - can't beat that. I'd recommend this place as a nice break from any of the other beaten-to-death pizza options in the city.",

Our go to meal is usually start with a small house salad and split one of the pastas and pizzas.  My favorite pasta is their vodka pasta, however I don't think they carry it anymore.  The brick oven pizza is delicious! My only complaint about the pizza is just a little too much crust at the end. But I think that's pretty typical for brick oven pizza.  In the summer I recommend sitting outside on their back patio. It's very cozy! They also allow dogs if you sit at one of their tables out front on the sidewalk. Always a plus in my book! All around good restaurant and one of my go to places that never disappoints.",

Food is really good - I recommend the Arancini (get the meatless option, definitely tastier), the Caprese salad (insalata capresa), and the Pollo Limone for sure. Tasty options. Service isn't bad either.   Pickup though, is another story. Every instance I've called for pickup, they give me a time of 30 minutes, I get there, and it takes at least 20 minutes after I get there for me to get my food. Makes me wonder what the point of calling ahead is. Every. Time.   But this time, I'm a bit annoyed - I always get the Margherita Pizza, sometimes I'll get the Margherita DOC for the fancier mozzarella. The pizza was still tasty, but I'd expect a Margherita pizza to have more than 1.5 pieces of basil leaf when the general recipe for Margherita is mozzarella, tomato and basil. Also, same instance - ordered food, waited 18 extra minutes after arrival to pick up, and then my pizza was cold.   So, dine in, don't pick up.",

Of the three options, the branzino was my favorite, delicately cooked and simply tasty. The chicken was tender and juicy. We topped it all off with tiramisu, which was packed with soft marscapone cheese and pungent coffee taste. Overall great experience!",

To be honest - everything that we had today was just average - nothing that felt great , a few things that were not right and nothing that was just outright terrible .  The positives - the service . We were well attended to and decent recommendations were made where asked for . The negatives- price is on the higher side for the food and the ambience , the restaurant does not have great decor/ does not look fancy - I believe the restaurant in warrendale is much better. We ordered the Peach Bellini - seems like there were way too many house flies around - they found their way twice into the Bellini ! Good for them and not so good for us - the first time was without drinking a sip so was instantly replaced . We were not so lucky the second time around . Were not offered a replacement neither were we in the mood for one .  And now the average: we tried the Arancini ( rice balls) as they were recommended - maybe we did not have a taste for them but they were just average and nothing to rave about .  The pizza dough was super nice but the PROSCIUTTO E ARUGULA was just ok - for a $22 pizza you expect a little more flavor . Again - it wasn't bad but maybe we had higher expectations. Boxed a Tiramisu for home - just had some of it and nothing to complain .  So overall - just average and maybe not worth a second shot - lots of other places to try ! Would have been nice if we weren't asked to pay for the Bellini though :)",

Upon further review, the 13-year-old version of me was dead wrong.  It's authentic wood-fired brick oven pizza with high-grade ingredients. The buffalo mozzarella rules, the toppings are top-notch, and the crust is the type you can only achieve with this type of prep and this kind of oven, which is to say it's perfect.    I especially recommend the patio out back if it's nice out.  Also, the cocktails are shockingly good here. In particular, I'm a fan of the negroni because they chose Carpano Antica vermouth. There simply is no better way to start an Italian feast than with THE classic aperitif drink, and Il Pizzaiolo cared enough to serve a spot-on version.",

While I thought the wine bar was cozy, the other customers there were rude and self-centered, ignoring polite \"excuse me\" by the waitstaff.   When we were finally seated, we waited about 10 minutes before a server appeared.  The food was prompt, and the salad was more than enough to share.  The pizza was simply ok.  I've had much better wood-fired pizza elsewhere.  Beware:  for just a party of five, they added a 20% tip onto the bill.  If you're going to add a tip to a bill, make it the customary 18%.  But frankly, I didn't think they needed to add the tip for us.  Also, do not use multiple credit cards.  I was charged for the entire bill on my card, even though we asked to split it between two.

One of only 16 places in the US officially certified by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, they make the official Napolitan pizza, which adheres to strict guidelines. Here are some of them:  \"The pizza has to be round. It mustn't be more than 13 inches in diameter. The crust has to be  of an inch at the most, and the center has to be less than a tenth of an inch high!  Naturally the dough must be kneaded by hand. Rolling pins and dough machines are just not acceptable.\"  Pretty frickin anal huh? But when you taste the pizza you realize the guidelines are right on. And must have been developed by some Italian dudes over several hundred years. Or you'd like to think that.  Unfortunately everyone knows about the amazing pizza, so its PACKED if you go on a weekend and I mean PACKED! Sadly they don't take reservations, its walk-in only.   On a Saturday night around 7pm it was choc full of suburbanite yuppy families and thirty-something double dates. If you are up to waiting for a long time in a tight space with these people in order to achieve pizza-heaven then go on a weekend. Otherwise I am sure lunch or a week night is less crowded.",

The Barbera d' Asti they have by the glass is excellent! We ordered the Carcuccieri pizza (or had a similar name- the one with artichokes and prosciutto) and loved every bite. Real wood-oven cooked thin crust pizza, with good quality toppings and San Marzano tomato sauce. Molto bene!  We parked on the street and were able to find a spot easily. Seemed like a pretty and safe neighborhood. When the weather is decent, dine outside on their back patio. It's gorgeous and romantic!",

But I can't in good conscience give a higher rating to 12-inch, 4-cut pizzas that run $17 or $18, no matter how tasty they are.  The dough and prep are top notch, but the toppings were pretty ordinary -- not foraged wild mushrooms, shaved truffles or anything larks'-tongues-in-aspic rare and exotic, after all.",

We've tried other combinations. But this one never disappoints and is plenty for two. The vodka sauce is the best I've had and the pizza - better than any I've had in Chicago, New York, Miami, wherever. It's THE BEST. Wood fired pizzas have become a dime a dozen these days. But Il Piz is still number 1 in my book.",

I am pretty simple, but some veggies aside without added oils, make me a mega salad or plant based plate.  I am happy to pay whatever they want for such accommodations.  The manager said it would depend on what they had left over. . .seriously!?!  I am amazed she could not arrange to put some veggies aside before they were prepped with oil.  She suggested chicken.

I consider myself to be an excellent judge of Italian food and this place was really good.  We ate dinner in the wine bar which is out back and up a set of stairs.  It was a little more intimate than the front dining area.    I'm a fan of sweet wines and there were a lot of drier options so I went with the blood orange martini and it was fruity without being overly sweet.  There were so many delicious meatless options on the menu that I was really debating what to order.  I LOOOOVE fresh mozzarella and basil, so it was like my own little slice of heaven.  I went with the rigatoni with eggplant, marinara, fresh basil and mozzarella.  I cleaned my very large plate and even used some of their bread to wipe it a little cleaner.  I'm eager to go back and try some of the other fare.  I also want to give mad props to our waiter who helped me make my choice and provided excellent descriptions of the food!  My only real complaint is the olive oil they serve with the bread.  It could use some flavor or seasonings or even just some parm and a little pepper.  The only bland item I tasted.   Also, the restaurant is a little pricey.  Not ridiculous but not cheap either (especially when you add on a drink).",

    "text": "Growing up in Mt. Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.  We were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \"we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\" She points to a small table for 4 and says \"You'll sit there.\" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused.   Paragraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant  We were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.  Our server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.  As for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food.   There are so many options in downtown Mt. Lebanon that there's no reason to put up with bad service, attitude, and mediocre, overpriced food. I won't be coming here again.",

Had to wait to be seated in the restaurant so went to the wine bar and met a few different people - the people were all very friendly and made it seem like we were regulars.  Had the Doc Margherita pizza. It was very good with fresh buffalo mozzarella and basil.  Have been here a few times and have tried some pasta's and other pizza's and have found some to be very good but others were rather bland...so the consistency may not be there.  Il Piz. does have a quite a few different specialty style pizza's and seem to have mostly fresh ingredients.  I can see why people really like this place and return.

Service was average, the server a little aloof, minimal conversation..all okay, but the pizza didn't impress me, and WAY to expensive for quality of what you receive. The pizza is cooked in wood oven, but dough still soggy, not bad, but not worth 18$ for a pizza  (all pizzas are about size of an appetizer somewhere else). Note, no fountain soda, so 2$ for 8 oz.bottle coke..so place is average at best, nothing outwardly wrong, except the price indicates a pretty decent place but quality is that of a quick cafe pizza that should be 10$, not 18$+.",

Being a beer drinker I went with a Hoegaarden.  While we waited for our entrees we were served 2 large pieces of cooked pizza dough that had salt and olive oil on them. I think they ran out of bread but this almost homemade breadstick was fantastic!  Our entrees arrived promptly and I went with the rigatoni which came with 3 meatballs. The sauce was a great combo of sweet/savory and the meatballs were delicious.  My family member ordered one of the pizzas which came with arugula and prosciutto-it was enough for 2 meals and great to take home.  The prices are reasonable for a finer Italian restaurant.

You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.\" We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15, so we walked back in and were seated right away.    Food was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.  If you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place.",

All were amazing and on par with the quality I found in Italy.  They also had a nice selection of Italian craft beers which I've never seen anywhere else in the US before.  I just wish they'd include some English descriptions of them on the menu!  All the staff there is also very friendly and attentive.

    "text": "I wanted to give this place a \"5\" but then thought \"they should be more generous with their fresh basil this time of year.\"  (After this past winter we are really craving our Summer herb garden).  This is not an indictment of the quality of the food or experience as all portions were wonderfully seasoned and the staff was overly competent and nice/non-pretentious.  I enjoyed the Italian food menu and Italian wine/beer menu.    I'm not religious but I said a quiet \"thank-you\" to the stars for not letting us walk out of the place when we were told we would have a 10 minute wait.   It was a Friday night (and we expected some congestion uptown).  We were redirected to wait in the adjacent wine bar, where we happily stayed to wait out our 10 minutes- but we decided to leave after 7 minutes (thinking we could find \"somewhere else\").  Upon exit we thanked the hostess and asked her to take our names from the wait list.  At that time the hostess informed us that we could be seated right away and that they were beginning to look for us.  We stayed, thankfully.  In addition to the Belgian beer and the Italian Summer wine we ordered the Caprese Salad and the Margherita pie.  It was wonderful to receive the appetizer with enough time to enjoy it before the pie arrived because the salad was worth savoring for awhile.  Tasty tomatoes, fresh Basil, and a wonderful, almost mushy, *Mozzarella ball.  The pie was a wonderful blend of a lively aromatic sauce, gently melted slices of Mozzarella cheese, and various stages of wood fired dough throughout.    *The Mozzarella seemed to be crafted in house.  Really fresh and ripe.     Ours was a great experience (food, service, etc.) on a hectic night.  I'm so glad we stayed.  Not too pricey.  Essentially what you would expect to pay for a fine dinner on a Friday night.  Also, the Olive Oil was remarkable, probably a mid to high end Greek.  We would have enjoyed a little more of the Olive Oil in addition to the fresh basil.",

So, when I got the chance to show up here, I was very excited!  We made a reservation for a weekend afternoon, so not necessary, BTW.  The interior is shall we say cozy?  We got our pick of tables.  Service was meh.  Our service acted bored until we mentioned that this was our first visit, then we were given her high energy sales pitch, \"delicious food created using old-world techniques and the high quality ingredients.  Most menu items are hand-made and if they are not, they are imported from the best sources\".  Did she forget anything?  I hope not!  Wait, there is more, \"the mozzarella is direct from Naples\".  That's more like it, gf, show some enthusiam!  Lots of great choices on the menu!  BJ got the Chicken Cacciatore and I got the lasgana.  Our server warned us of the extra wait time for my meal.  No problem, I was willing to wait for this classic homemade dish!  Unfortunately, it did to live up to my expectations.  First off, it was served lukewarm.  Back to the oven for my dish!  It was a little better the second time around.  Nothing special about the sauce or meat.  BJ liked his dish, too.  But really nothing special.  All in all, a decent meal.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  But we had nothing that we would make us want to go back.",

A deliciously thin and chewy crust, but not crispy, Neapolitan crusts should never be crispy. The pizza may be the star of the show, but the rest of the offerings are also delicious. The fresh burrata appetizer is wonderfully creamy. The arancini are good, but would maybe benefit from a bold and spicy saucy. Don't sleep on a classic, the chicken Marsala was seriously excellent. I hear most of the pasta is housemade and since I didn't have any, I have a reason to stop back the next time I'm in PGH.",

Since it is considered a wine bar in that particular portion of the restaurant, I would except more wine by the glass, no matter the price. I would pay $$$$ for wine by the glass, so I know I like it and then would pay $145 for a bottle.  Then there's the main restaurant that I really wasn't that impressed with. We were sat at the table with the most slant...which there were other open tables for two with No slant. Our glasses were sliding down the table so we used our silverware to stop them from sliding. No joke! The food I ordered was penne alla vodka, which was pretty tasty. But for $18, and that's all you get?! I've had better. The bread wasn't impressive, just sliced up sour dough bread with not so high end olive oil. (You can taste the difference between a really good olive oil and a bulk cheap kind).   Having said that, I will certainly return to the wine bar for maybe a glass of wine and try maybe the pizza, but not the main restaurant.",

Meanwhile looking around the restaurant empty tables everywhere. The hostess stated they were for reservations, now previously in the day I visited the website only to see that they did accept reservations so that rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to leave but the group I was with wanted to stay. Finally we asked the hostess how much longer? To which she responded \"just sit them some where\" . Which mean me feel totally awkward and totally unwelcome. The food was mediocre at best and expensive. I will never patronize  this establishment again, due to the way I was treated.

Other things I've tried here include the mussels, the lasagna (a serious choice for meat-lovers... comes with both sausage AND meatballs), and the tiramisu.  All were delicious.  I have yet to try something bad here!  The best place to dine, in my opinion, is the back patio...if you can get a seat there and the weather permits.  It is gorgeous and peaceful and has a very European feel about it.  A bonus for dog-lovers is that they will let you have your pup back there with you (leashed and on good behavior).  One of the few back patios in Pittsburgh that will allow it!  Not only that, but the staff LOVES dogs and will provide doggie water and petting ;)  The wine bar is also very cute.  It is a bit dark for dining, but it's super cozy and a great place to hang out and drink.  On busy nights, you will have an easier time getting a table here than in the main room or patio.  They have a huge selection of italian wines and a wide range of prices to suit any budget.  Service has never been short of satisfactory here in my experience, even on busy nights.",

We were able to get a table without reservations or a wait at around 6pm on a Friday which was a pleasant surprise!  The restaurant is nice and cozy inside, if a bit loud.  My friends were already dining on the fried cheese balls, which were described by the waiter as \"an explosion in your mouth of cheesy goodness.\"  cheesy goodness explosion?  sign me up.  I'm not even going to try to act like a refined foodie I will do damn near anything for cheese and brother, we had CHEESE.  they brought bread out, and it was pretty good but not interesting bc it did not contain cheese.  I ordered the chicken piccatta, one friend had chicken cacciatore, another had the lasagna, and then my healthy vegetarian friend had some dish of marinated vegetables.  who the hell cares about marinated vegetables?  that was the one dish I did not sample as it did not contain cheese.    The wine list was also very good and the waiter knew what he was talking about and I did not find the upcharge outrageous.  The chicken cacciatore was pretty good.  Here's the thing:  my friend who got it alwyas plays it cool so she was all, \"It's alright.\"  I tasted it, and it was good as hell!  Its hard to mix sausage and chicken in one dish but this was pretty good.    My friend has the lasagna and it was so good as soon as I took a bite I was so overwhelmed by how good it was I smacked him in the shoulder.  It was AMAZING.  I dont know how it is sooo good, I think it is layered with alternating layers of cocaine, love, and cheese.    In a lame attempt to be healthy, I ordered the chicken piccatta.  When a waiter says, \"you know, its good but here's what I recommend...\"  I need to learn to recognize that for the \"get something else!\" that statement is.  For some reason my entree came out 10 min after everyone elses. I ordered it bc I thought it would be healthier than heavy pasta but it was swimming in a lemon butter sauce that was not healthy but very good.  There were capers in the dish too and they were the only thing interesting about it.  This dish was pleasant but unremarkable and underwhelming.  Get something else.  Ask the waiter what to get and then trust his judgement.  I will def be back, and the next time I am back I think I'll try the pizza that they are so famous for.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you have not been there..",

However, If your planning on stopping in for early lunch with more than 5 people, prepare to play Rock Paper Scissors on who's going to pay the bill. Nowhere was it posted or was communicated to us in the beginning that parties of 6 or more will share one bill. If it was, we would have asked the waitress at the beginning on how she could accommodate us since we all had debit cards. When it came down to pay the bill, we asked if we could get the checks split into 4 different checks since it was not busy at all, but we were immediately given attitude and told no. Finally she gave in an had split the checks. Overall, our waitress did not seem like she wanted to be there or to be serving us to begin with. I suggest that ownership re-evaluate staff and how they present and represent their business..",

    "text": "This restaurant is going downhill.  I used to frequent this location years ago, and loved it!  I returned a few months ago, to get treated to an overpriced, underwhelming experience that led to both myself and my date getting food poisoning over bad mussels.  By the way, it was a first date, nothing says \"go out with this guy again\"  like being glued to your toilet the entire next day praying that you'll just die.  I called them, and told them what happened (specifically stating I wasn't looking for a handout, I just wanted to let them know that their mussels had turned, and they should check their product), and the manager told me that I had to have been mistaken, and that they only keep in fresh ingredients.  They did send me a $15 gift card, which I thought was nice even though that a $15 gift card is the middle finger of gift cards, so I decided to try them once more.  OK, so that was just a fluke, they gave me a gift card, time to put on my optimistic pants and try again.  So I took one of my long time friends out for lunch.  We walked in, and we were given the new option to sit in the \"Wine Bar\".    OOOooo, color me intrigued.    So they took us outside, up some stairs, and into what I'm guessing was a middle aged Persian's studio apartment above a garage that they converted into a dining room.  We then waited for service for an inhuman amount of time before we were given waters.  I ordered a dry red wine, and my friend ordered a cocktail.  We waited, and eventually got those, and they were actually very nice.    We ordered mussels again (cringe) and the meat and cheese plate.  First thing I knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate.  They replaced the normal wooden board, and replaced it with a plate.  A white, boring, incredibly small plate.  On top of it all, it was more of a plate of lunch meat than a charcuterie!  Blah.  The mussels were good though, and my bowels remained intact, though we asked for bread when it was dropped, and had to ask for it a second time.  What a waste, the broth was actually good, but cold by the time we actually got our bread.  So I'm sorry Il Pizzaiolo, I really tried to like you, but until the quality returns, I won't be.  TL;DR  Don't go here, there are a ton of cheaper, better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh",

    "text": "After several disappointing trips to the Il Pizzaiolo in Market Square, I had heard good things about the Mount Lebo location and decided to give it a try. I went with Turkish Engineer (TE) on a snowy weekend evening. We dined rather early, so there was no wait. Unfortunately throughout the meal, I noticed almost the same (if not more) problems with service and food.   Our drink (two sodas) and appetizer orders were taken almost immediately (great!). But we were not given silverware or napkins and for some reason could not possibly distract our waitress to obtain any. We snagged some from a nearby empty table instead. My soup and TE's frittatine arrived a short time later. The wedding soup was delicious, with savory meatballs, spinach, and orzo. I did ask for some parmesan cheese to put in the soup, and our waitress shook exactly half a teaspoon over the bowl and quickly departed. Since when is parmesan cheese a limited commodity? The way the servers at Il Pizzaiolo protect the freshly grated parm, you'd think it was made of gold flakes. But I digress. The frittatine (fried pasta with bechamel sauce and cheese) was quite bland. After a few bites, we had it wrapped to add tomatoes and herbs at home.   Then our pizzas arrived; I ordered the margherita doc (mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce)  and TE chose the funghi (mushroom). My pizza, (despite it being short on the basil), was very tasty. TE was upset to find he was served not a pizza with mushrooms, but one with sausage instead. He asked if he had ordered correctly, and I said that he had. Even the patron next to us said that TE had indeed ordered the mushrooms. The waitress seemed a little unnerved but quickly had the kitchen make a new pizza.   Overall, a disappointing dining experience. It took forever to get water and any other items we needed for our meal.  We tried to be patient, as we only saw two servers working. However, there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing. The restaurant was by no means crowded (this was a Sunday). Moreover, what is the point of having three hostesses and two overworked servers? It doesn't make sense.   I will speak up for the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Everything is freshly made, especially the pizzas. That is great. But otherwise, the food and service at Il Pizzaiolo is severely lacking.",

The pizzas took forever to come out and when they did they were soggy in the middle which meant I had to cut and scoop with a fork.  Not the way a $20 pizza (10\" diameter) should be.  The server was very nice but anytime we needed anything he was nowhere to be found and took a long time to find him.  I don't plan on being back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I loooooovvvvveeeeeed Il Pizzaiolo... my only reason for not giving it 5 stars, she did not warn us not to get two pizzas just for the two of us :)  Considering that they were not that busy, she seemed a little put off by questions so we just ordered and hoped for the best.  The food was so good though, I can see past the not so service oriented attitude.    We went here for lunch one Saturday when we were running around, and I have to say, I enjoyed it far more than I had expected that I would.  We each got a salad, and we each got a pizza.  We both were very happy and satisfied.   I think that my pizza was perfection (Margherita).  One of the best that I have ever had!    The only complaint... I had a glass of wine too and for a lunch, we spent $75... a little excessive.  Next time we would be able to get away with one pizza :)    I am excited for the downtown location to open up... and be able to go have a dinner where I can justify the expense a bit more!",

    "text": "On my second adventure to this wonderful restaurant, my expectations were met yet again.  It was a busy Friday night, but we just headed up to the wine bar to enjoy cocktails until our table was ready. I had a yummy wine, and my BF had an amazing margarita. When we were seated our server was friendly and let us know about the days specials. Throughout the meal, while he was quite busy, we were not neglected and I always had a full glass of wine. :) I decided on gnocchi and my bf went with a pizza....both we so delicious. Their food is just amazing, I could not rave about it enough.  I've seen people complain that sometimes they have to wait to be seated, but don't let this deter you from trying this amazing restaurant!",

    "text": "Okay, okay, I finally get it. I've been told about this place for years and finally stopped in on Friday night around 8 PM.  I guess I'm not the only person who likes pizza on a Friday night because it was packed.  However, we were escorted out back to a beautiful wine bar with great dark lighting, comfy furniture and additional seating.  THe bar itself was pretty small, maybe 8 seats and the place was packed.  It didn't affect our service which was quite good and no one in the group waited for a drink.  The crowd was (I hate this word) \"trendy\" and most were laughing and having fun.  THe wine seemed to be relatively reasonable priced, however I'd like more options than just italian wine.  We sampled a charcutterie platter which was amazing.  The meats were top notch and flavorful.  The hummus and olives were some of the best I've had and the buffalo mozzarrella was to die for. The best I've ever had.  After a few drinks we were able to secure a table for 6 in the front and the server was prompt and friendly.  Wow, the pizza truly the best I've had in the burgh'.  I love mineos, aiellos, and fioris as much as the next but this is in a different league.  We ordered the neoplolitan pizza which is very simple, light, thin crust and amazing flavor.  As another yelper mentioned this is one of only 16 pizza places in the states to be certified to serve authentic neopolitan pizza.  We also tried some of the other pasta dishes, which were very good but again go for the pizza.  It's one of the best pies I've had coast to coast and I'd stack up against Ray's or any other historic pizza joint in NYC.  I'd give it 5 stars if it had better parking and a better wine selection.",

    "text": "I checked out this place this evening before I went to a show at Destinta.  Yelp scores another good suggestion - this place is everything an Italian restaurant should be, with an interesting twist.  As I walked in, I saw exactly what I love to see in an Italian restaurant - tables placed relatively closely together in an intimate setting, but not close enough to feel like you're sitting on top of someone's lap.  The decor was also contemporary with a traditional flair.  What I didn't expect was the hostess informing me that I can wait at the wine bar if I'd like - what a welcome twist.  Out of the back of the restaurant and into what should have been someone's kitchen, was a wonderfully decorated wine bar and lounge, with a small seating area adjacent to it.  It was nice to sit back and relax for a few minutes and take in everything.  The wait time wasn't too bad for a Saturday night at 6:30 pm, my guess it was only like 15 minutes (but I think that was because a large party had ended up leaving, but who's counting =) )   Anyway, after being seated I ordered the pizza (like everyone else who left reviews).  and it was out of this world awesome.  I laughed because I spent as much on the wine as I did on dinner.  I ordered Tiarmisu for dinner, which was perfect.  For two people going out on a Saturday night, spending under sixty bucks to have dinner, drinks, and dessert is pretty unusual.  This place is a real find and everyone should check it out.",

    "text": "The pizza at Il Pizzaiolo was fantastic.  We ordered 3 pizzas: the Margherita, the Bianca, and the fennel sausage and rapini pizza (I forget the menu name).  My favorite was the Bianca - the ricotta cheese pushed it over the top.  The ambiance was very nice as well.  We sat in the outdoor seating in the back, which had a perfect combination of sun and shade.  The reason I gave a 4 star rating was for the somewhat slow and inattentive service.  I can't say that the service is typically like this, but we had a waitress in-service who was still learning and IMO, a bit overwhelmed.  But otherwise, I would highly recommend Il Pizzaiolo.",

    "text": "It's what you'd get in better pizzerie in Italy.  Ron has many of his ingredients shipped from Italy.  It's a light, airy artisinal 12-13\" pie that you can eat all on your own.  Our fave has been the prosciutto and arugula, but all the pies are excellent.  Pasta is also good.  We've had them all and the only one we've been disappointed was the all' amartricana.  The clam and the simpler preparations really let the pastas shine.  Wines are all Italian and feature numerous bottles from regions that are underrepresented in other Pgh restaurants.  Wines by the glass are fairly priced.  It's a definite 4.5, with the only flaws being a couple of pasta dishes that don't put the emphasis on the pasta itself.",
