There's a nice variety of foods available with a peruvian twist.  I had the chicken kabob with rice while my friend had a huge chicken quesadilla.  The chicken was a little on the dry side, but really flavorful and the rice was pretty decent.   Beverage options include mango and guava juices, Inca Cola, along with your standard Pepsi products (pretty sure it was Pepsi).  I had a piece of Tres Leches cake for dessert which was awesome!   Next time I'll try the plantains and the quarter-chicken.  Quick note about the service.  It was great!  You order your food at the counter and sit down and the food is brought out to you when it's ready.  The guys were very helpful and actually came by not only to check on our meal, but they also later cleared away our plates for us.  In addition to helping customers at the counter and in the dining room.",

Before I came here I always thought this one of those restaurants in the strips that no one ever eats at. I put it at the bottom of my list until I went there the first time.

The server also put down a squeeze bottle with a green, salsa style liquid in it. I decided to  squeeze a quarter sized amount on a chip..... BOOM!! It was flavor paradise!!! Then the heat came from out of nowhere!! That was it for me! I AM A FAN!   When the burrito came out I took a huge bite and it was awesome. The chicken had a very \"Fresh, Clean\" flavor. So I squirted some of this Green Love on my burrito...... I couldn't believe this jewel of restaurant is in my own back yard!!!

    "text": "Fans of the dearly departed George Aiken's have a new avenue for which to dine on roasted chicken.   Yeah, you wouldn't think you'd find such a thing at a Latin restaurant, but based on a recent visit, CL's cluckers are as moist, crackled, well-seasoned, and ideally prepared overall as I recall GA's being. Now that's what Kay had (1/4 of a chicken. They can be had in halves or wholes as well.).  I simply feasted on a massive deep-fried chicken burrito (named the Giant Crispy Chicken Burrito) that revealed juicy proteins, and gobs of liquefied cheddar once I got to the innards (it took a few bites). The outer tortilla resembled a sopapilla in both taste and texture. Inside was pure Mexican gastrobliss.   Dessert for me it was a square cut of Tres Leches Cake that that brought together rice pudding and tiramisu with its dairy-derived, candy-coated flavors.   Let's not omit the Soft Fried Plantains or the Yucca Fries from this narrative for they both offered a welcome diversion from standard french fries with their arch-starchiness, mild sugariness, and density.   I tried the Inka Kola as a beverage and found that it was essentially a more refreshing version of cream soda. I'll take a case of the stuff, gracias.   The service was inviting, the decor was vibrantly ethnic, and the prices were right for my budget. Try not to miss it when you're cruising through The Strip. Psst. Look for the sign with the arrow.",

I mean I love farm to table local sourced as much as any foodie but some times I don't care if it was free range raised by farmer John seasoned with 15 seasonings and slow roasted over cherry wood and lava rocks from Krakatoa. some times I just want good roast chicken with great rice and black beans and a side of plantains.",

Grocery store rotisserie chicken, I am embarrassed for you. Chicken Latino's rotisserie chicken has put you to shame.

The problem is that I usually make my way to the Strip District earlier in the morning and I'm home by 10am while Chicken Latino only opens at 11am.  But one Friday I went down a bit later than I usually do and hit up all the hot spots before ending up here for lunch promptly at 11:05am.  The menu is pretty basic, not overwhelming.  I kept it simple and went for the Giant Crispy Chicken Burrito and Yucca Fries.  The $4 price tag on the fries seemed a bit steep until I saw the portion.  After eating my deep fried burrito, I could barely touch the fries and saved most of them for later.    The staff and decor are welcoming and I thoroughly enjoyed my selections.  That burrito was delicious portions of chicken and cheese inside the most amazing crunchy goodness.  And the yucca fries, well, they were good even when reheated.  I will definitely go back to try something new and if this first taste is any indication, I shan't be disappointed.",

I actually thought the chicken was alright, slightly better than the giant eagle rotisserie chicken.  I agree with prior customers, the green chili sauce made it worth the while. I actually thought their fries were better than the fried yuca.  It was more dense and chewy than it's counterpart and lacked in flavor.  The fried plantains were amazing and I would definitely recommend getting them! The price was insanely cheap and so we left happy and significantly bloated.",

When I first moved here, I was in the phase of obsessing over Peruvian chicken and yuca fries, so this has become my goto dinner place on the weekend. The price is so reasonable, and I always leave here with my stomach happy, and have some leftover with me for the next day. I brought so many different friends to try this place, everyone seems to love it. The only suggestion I will give is I wish Yucca fries or plantain can be options for the sides. I really only want chicken and yucca fries, but I always got to pick a side so I do double rice and an order of yucca fries. Anyway, if you are hesititating on trying this place, just do it :D But make sure you read their hours first before you go, because they do close really early most days.",

I highly recommend the pulled pork (SO TENDER) and definitely coat it with the green sauce they provide. Their yuca fries are awesome, as are their quesadillas and ...well pretty much everything. If you eat the yuca fries, ask for mayo and mix it with the green sauce~best dipping sauce evaaa  That being said...does anyone know what is in the green sauce?",

The chicken had been marinated and cooked to flavorful tender perfection. I think my wife was expecting the ceviche to be diced instead of chunked but it was flavorful no less. We had a fried plantain appetizer that came very quickly.  The green sauce condiment was spicy and was a great companion for the chicken beans and rice. Prices reasonable for the large portions.

Their menu is succint and clear, a good thing for a starving diner that doesnt want to read 20 pages to figure out dinner. I cannot comment on the apps, as I ordered the 1/2 chicken dinner with rice and beans.   All of it was delicious, and you get a TON of food for what you pay. I think my meal was the same price as some sort of gastro-death that is a Wendys meal. It was also leagues better. The chicken is perfectly spiced and extremely tender. The spices permeate throughout the meat and you are given a bottle of green chili sauce to liberally pour all over everything if you choose. It is spicy and delectable.   I will return for a simple, awesome meal.",

    "text": "Peruvian chicken is one of the tastiest ways to eat chicken ever.  It's marinated overnight in a blend of herbs and seasonings and then slow roasted to result in super tender and flavorful meat.  In Pittsburgh there are two places to get Peruvian chicken; AJ's Peruvian in Oakland and Chicken Latino in the Strip District.  Both places serve up super tasty chicken, but there are slight differences in their marinade which make them slightly different.  I always get a half chicken minimum; I gotta have my dark meat!  They also have more Americanized dishes as well as Mexican dishes, but when I go to Chicken Latino I order chicken.  On weekends they also serve up roast pork and ceviche, which is suppose to be really good as well (I have yet to try them).  I would recommend not only Chicken Latino but also all Peruvian chicken out there in the world.  Check it out.",

I have been craving the rotisserie chicken and the bright green chile sauce in the squeeze bottle it comes with ever since my first visit. I've been back a few times since then and it's been perfect every single time.  The chicken is so delicious - perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. I easily took out the quarter chicken with rice and beans and plantains on the side. The green chile sauce is perfect on everything. That sauce is just as delicious as the chicken and it's a balanced tasty-hot counterpoint to the entree.  On a Sunday lunch after church with my family, we did the whole chicken, rice and beans and fried plantains. A great meal at a great price ($20 altogether).  This place is great for kids, the service is very friendly and attentive, prices are great and the food is delicious. What's not to love about this place?",

Fast service. We got our food in 2 minutes! All in all, great food, modest price, and a joint that may not be your choice for a romantic evening on the town but certainly a place where the family would eat a hearty meal.

    "text": "How did I never review this??  Seriously. I love this place!  I first hit CL at lunch with some coworkers when I was working down in the Strip.  They so raved about it - and they are not \"ethnic\" eaters - that I had to try it.  All I can say is \"oh my\".  This burrito was both quantity and quality.  It was overstuffed with rice, black beans, this fantastic Peruvian chicken, and cheese.  I realized immediately that this burrito was fantastically tasty and, unfortunately, too much for one lunch..... so I polished the entire thing off anyway.  It took twice as long to walk back to work as it did to get there.... but it was so worth it.   And, for less than the price of a fast-food burger, I was in burrito heaven.  So, of course, then it was a matter of taking DH there on a weekend.  We had been walking the strip for hours and were famished having skipped breakfast and lunch and it was late afternoon, so we ordered heartily - he got a burrito, I ordered a quesadilla, and we split a bowl of tortilla soup along with an order of nachos.  I don't know what they do to their salsa but, damn, it is tasty.  It has such a nice light kick to it - not enough to keep your tongue burning, just enough to make it tasty - and those chips. I don't know. Maybe they dust them with crack cocaine - they are totally addictive.  I don't know what makes them so good but they truly are fantastic.    The quesadilla was HUGE. And stuffed nicely with chicken, rice, black beans, and cheese .  1/2 of it came home and the teenager ate it later.  The tortilla soup was very good.  Nicely spiced.  Not too junked up with stuff (I hate when they throw so much cheese and strips on the top that you feel like you are eating the Mexican version of French onion soup).    Having hit it several times since then for lunch, we made it down again over the weekend with DH and TS before the Pittsburgh Power game - and we heartily dug in and enjoyed our meal immensely.    The waitstaff is friendly and fun - they are attentive and helpful when you are ordering.  Prices are soooo reasonable.  There are not many places where you can feed three adults - with a lot of leftovers to go home - for about $10-12 a person.  And we could have easily spent less if we didn't want the leftovers - but what fun would that be???  I hate to recommend this place because I hate to see it become crowded like that place across the street on weekends ;)  but I have to share this place - it is so good and they deserve to be a huge success.  So go and enjoy -",

    "text": "Another awesome meal at Chicken Latino!! The prices are good, the service quick and efficient, and the food...ah the food! The last time we were here we tried the whole chicken, and it was delicious. Fresh and falling off the bone, it melts in your mouth. Try it with a dribble of their special sauce (trust me, a bit is all you need!), and you will be in heaven. The chips are fresh and crispy, and the homemade salsa has just enough kick to it. We washed it down with excellent hot cinnamon tea (we were there in the winter). The second time we went we both ordered the slow roasted pork with rice, beans, and fries. The pork was amazing, and quite tender and moist. Try it with the sauce as well! The fries were also good, but the rice is just standard, so I left most of that on my plate. But, the generous helping of pork kept me happy. Definitely check this place out the next time you are in the Strip District!",

Chicken Latino has always delivered awesome food and portions for a reasonable price. The green sauce.....dont get me started, I can guzzle it! I love the burritos (sour cream& salsa inside...specify when ordering), the pgh chicken salad, yucca, lomo, and ceviche are mu favoritess. Always a friendly staff and good food. I always recommend this place to my customers and friends....if youre hungry, go here!!!!",

    "text": "On a winters day in Pittsburgh when the windchill is in the negatives and snow is falling; there are a few things more satisfying and comforting than a warm chicken dinner. Or lunch in my case. I work down the street from Chicken Latino and it is a place I have passed many times in the strip district but unfortunately had never entered. Immediately upon entering this establishment you can tell that it is somewhere that you want to dine. The signage is colorful the dining room is clean and the smell is amazing.   I ordered the 1/4 chicken with a side of rice and beans. My total came to less than $10, which admittedly made me wonder how much food I would get.  However when I receive my to go box the weight of it put those fears to rest. My food came out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes, which is appreciated when you're pressed for time during the lunch break. I requested extra of the \"green sauce\" (aji picante) and headed back to work. This is a meal that your coworkers will envy. They give you enough rice to feed a small country. The chicken is super moist, tender and delicious. And the beans are really just an extra bonus that tie the meal together. The only thing I can think to compare this meal to is a warm hug.   Chicken Latino is definitely one is Pittsburgh's not so hidden gems. It is a place that you could pretty much take anyone, because who doesn't love chicken? The speedy and attentive service makes it a great place to go on a lunch break but the size of the meals would make it a great dinner spot as well. Chicken Latino does a great job at serving up authentic Peruvian food to Pittsburghers and any tors that might visit the Strip District. I will definitely be visiting again!",

    "text": "Peruvian chicken is the focus for Chicken Latino, so unless you are vegetarian you might as well try something with chicken -- if you're not in the mood for a huge hunk of chicken, then maybe try a soft chicken burrito or chicken quesadilla. First a bit of a warning though -- the portions are huge so unless you are starving, you will have trouble finishing the quesadilla or burrito on your own. Either split, plan to take leftovers home, or eat too much and leave feeling slightly sick which is what I usually make the mistake of doing. Note that (somewhat surprisingly) the quesadilla is actually a lot more food than the burrito.  My favorite tried-and-True menu option is the soft chicken burrito, but the green hot sauce which comes in a squeeze bottle on the table is the real star of the meal. If you like spicy food,  make sure to squirt it liberally on your burrito. If not, still try a little because it is delicious. Note that the hot sauce (strangely) has bread in it, so be aware if you are gluten sensitive.  Although it's not listed on all the menus, it's also possible to get a \"naked\" burrito bowl and then add hot corn tortillas on the side. This would make a good option to split with a friend. It's also possible to add onions and peppers to your burrito or bowl.  Other standout items include the fried plantains appetizer, and tres leches cake for dessert.  Overall this is a decent restaurant, super casual, and good value for the amount of food you get.",

Such was the case last week when myself and three friends gathered here for dinner the day after Chicken Latino was closed due to their protest against the immigration ban. *sigh* We intentionally came here to support your amazing food and wonderful staff.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla and yuca fries, would recommend. Two others ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken with rice and black beans and the last person in my party ordered the giant fried burrito. We barely spoke as we ate outside of our grunts to pass the \"green sauce.\" Our waitress was so kind and gave us a tip: mix the green sauce with mayo and try it on the yuca. Delish!!   I'll echo other comments and say the portions are large and I ended up taking half my food home. Reheated two days later in the oven and just as tasty!   Thank you Chicken Latino for existing and being so consistently delicious!",

It's a mystery I keep going back to investigate!  A sanctuary for authentic, flavorful food lovers, sweet plantain fiends, and the really hungry people coming down from the rush of Strip District shopping, this festively decorated space is bright and inviting... Essentially, the effect is like walking into a fiesta. The portions suggest you could definitely share an entree; However, you probably won't want to. Go extra hungry and you MIGHT be able to polish off one of the massive burritos. I'm personally very into the bright green sauce you can request for your grub. USE CAUTION, it is the special kind of hot that sneaks up on you and embraces you in a tongue-numbing hug. If you like that sort of thing, you can get a container for home.   There's so much to love at Chicken Latino, absolutely give this hidden gem a try next time you're in the Strip!",

I came here for lunch today with a friend, and we ordered the half Peruvian rotisserie chicken, yucca fries, and fried plantains, which was more than enough for the two of us.  I also had a bottle of Inca Cola, which I hadn't had since studying abroad in Quito in 2006.  We enjoyed the chicken, which I found tender and well-seasoned, particularly on the skin, particularly with the green sauce, which we mixed with mayo to cut the spiciness.  The yucca fries were also great with the sauce.  I wasn't as much of a fan of the plantains (too sweet), but this is probably an idiosyncratic matter, since I don't really care for bananas much.  All this food set us back about $20, which is pretty inexpensive for a sit down meal, though there is cheaper street food to be had nearby.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, helping us make decisions by making  suggestions.  I also enjoyed the wall hangings, which reminded me of the textiles available at indigenous markets in Ecuador.  One suggestion for improvement would be to have mayo available in squeeze bottles, similar to the green sauce, since tearing open packets is a pain and creates unnecessary waste.  Other than that, nice job and thanks for an enjoyable lunch!",

I'm usually not to fond of thick cut fries, but these fries were fried perfectly so that there was a nice crunch throughout each bite!  If you're at Chicken Latino- get the Lomo Saltado!

My mom is a vendor in the strip and when I went to visit her one Saturday we decided to order take out from here for dinner.   We ordered 3 chicken burritos to go and I have to say they were quick with putting these together; we were out in no time. These burritos are pretty massive in size and come packed with lots of chicken, rice and cheese (i left out the beans). The price is definitely reasonable for how much food you get! The sad part of the meal was it lacked flavor and the chicken was on the dry side. I'm not sure if maybe they were having an off day or if we just ordered the wrong thing on the menu since other yelpers seem to love the rotisserie chicken. I would consider giving this restaurant another try because I do not want to rule it out just yet.",

Chicken Latino is consistently putting out simple and well executed food, even if 95% of the time I'm ordering the same thing... tender spiced chicken, expertly seasoned rice and beans, and hot 'n crispy fried yucca.  Pair that with the aji picante (and a spot of mayo mixed in for the yucca... still great even though they changed mayo packet brands recently) and you've been filled with some unbelievable food for $10-15.  If ever I do venture into the restaurant world, I can only hope to achieve the consistency and quality that I've experienced time and again.  See you again this weekend...",

    "text": "I have walked past Chicken Latino literally hundreds of times. It is usually overshadowed by two of my favorite food establishments in the strip which just so happen to be directly across the street: Pamelas and Edgars taco stand. This is probably the main reason I have never been to this establishment until recently. But that all changed when my sister and her husband (who are also foodies) kept talking about this \"Chicken Latino\" place. They explained to me where it was and it finally hit me, it's the colorful place across the street from my two favorite places to eat in the strip, no wonder I haven't ever been there!   They told me to get the chicken burrito and yukka fries, then to mix the green sauce with mayo and put it on everything. This is exactly what I ordered, plus plantains because who doesn't love plantains?!?!   The food came out extremely fast and extremely hot. I was blown away by the size of the portions. \"This can't be?\" I thought to myself... this food has to be more expensive... NOPE! You get gigantic portions for extremely reasonable prices that all taste wonderful!   The chicken burrito was one of the best I've ever had. The yukka fries were so unique and tasty, they were fluffy and crunchy, salty and savory, like nothing I have ever had before! The plantains were cooked to perfection and on the sweeter side. I usually NEVER leave food on the table but this time I had to. So I boxed up the rest of my plantains and yukka fries and took them home which happened to taste even better later on!   I can't believe I waited so long to go to this place! From now on I'm going to have to spin in a circle in the middle of 21st street with my finger out and whichever of my 3 favorite strip districs restaurants I land on will be where I eat!",

Came here on a Sunday and we were lucky enough to get the last quarter of a chicken that they had. We did come here later in the afternoon, a little before they were to close. Along with the chicken, we also ordered the Slow Roasted Pork and Fried Plantains. What makes this chicken different from other rotisserie chicken is the herbs and spices as well as the cooking method. Apparently the juices drippings of the chicken create a steam that cooks the chicken and keeps it moist. After a taste, I would say that that was True. Incredibly moist and flavorful, slightly spicy, The slow roasted pork was also moist and flavorful and great alongside the green hot sauce they have at each table. The pork came with two sides which were rather ordinary. Fried plantains were perfectly sweet and crisp, yet soft. Just how I like it.  The restaurant was rather casual with some outdoor tables. Food was great and I would definitely come back. My one critique was that I felt rather rushed. Yes, we did come in when they were preparing to close but that still wasn't a reason to make customers feel unwanted considering we ordered and finished our meals well before they closed. Though I am really glad they accommodated us anyway, even if it was obligatory.",

Its similar to a roasted chicken but their chicken comes with better sides. They have a spicy green sauce that makes your tongue sizzle.  They have fries and coleslaw but for more authentic flavor go for the rice and been. They also have sweet potato fries and plantains. Lots of yummy choices. Our family of for got a family meal with a whole roasted chicken, fries and coleslaw for $20. We added family size sides of rice and beans. I should have taken a picture of our empty plates. They do have desserts but we were stuffed. The chicken is so moist and juicy that you want to get every tiny piece off the bones. I know another chicken establishment has the saying of \"finger licking good\" but Chicken Latinos' is even better.  They have burritos and quesadillas on their menu as well as several drink options. I like the mango soda. They have a nice selection of appetizers. The service and delivery of the food to your table is quick. You won't be disappointed.",

I was a bit disappointed to find out that they charge $.50 each for red salsa and sour cream but don't tell you that.  Nonetheless, this burrito is sensational.  But the 5 star point at Chicken Latino is the green sauce.  It is mouth-watering, spicy, amazingness in a cup.

When I went I got the Ceviche which was fresh and very flavorful and my boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken with rice and beans. The rotisserie chicken is soo good! So moist and full of flavor and that spicy green sauce puts it over the edge! It tastes incredible! This is officially my go to spot when I'm in the strip district.   So happy I came across this gem! The portions are very good for the price, and the cost is very affordable and reasonable. Definitely a must try in the area! Just wish they had natural juices or made their own.",

This place isn't upscale by any means, but it has what you could possibly need. Good food, fast service, and reasonable prices.  CRISPY YUCA ($5.99): Yuca french fries. I think a bit too crispy but they did serve it to us fresh and hot, lightly salted. Tasty with ketchup and the green sauce!!! 1/2 CHICKEN W/ RICE & COLESLAW ($7.99): Pretty good. Honestly tastes like your average, juicy rotisserie chicken. But I'll say it was my first time having ~Peruvian~ chicken and they made it a delicious experience :)! Rice was yummy and definitely needed if you're having the green sauce too. Coleslaw to cool it down a bit.   They didn't have the ceviche that day (winter time, less people so they didn't get ingredients around that time) which was so disappointing so maybe when I come back and have that it'll bump up to a 5.",

Yucca fries are a delicacy but needs to be cooked precisely to ensure it's not undercooked and crispy on the outside. Price point is great. They just need to find their mojo and enthusiasm for customer service and focus on ensuring the quality of food remains high.",

Together we shared a vegetarian quesadilla, fried plantains, Peruvian chicken, rice & beans, chicha limena & passion fruit drinks. The plantains were warm, crispy, sweet and comforting. The chicken was especially tasty and may have been my favorite part of the meal. I also loved the crispy vegetarian quesadilla with the the creamy black beans, fluffy rice, melty cheese, & salsa for added freshness. It's nice to have the choice of a vegetarian option that is both satisfying and well balanced. We also really enjoyed the exotic juices as they added an interesting flavor and were not too sweet. Our friend ordered the \"Pittsburgh style\" chicken salad loaded with shredded cheese and fries. Although the salad had a generous portion it was a bit heavy on the fries and cheese based on my observation of it.  We definitely plan to come back here again and are excited to try some of the other traditional foods on the menu such as the yuca fries and seviche. Yum!",

I got the chicken quesadilla-biggest quesadilla I've ever had. I ate about half and took the other half home. It was tasty, but it was nothing special. They have a spicy cilantro sauce they bring to the table, and it is incredible- it definitely gave the quesadilla the extra flair it was needing. I  presume the Peruvian cuisine is much better than their Mexican cuisine since they specialize in it. Next time, I will be trying something from that side. Overall, the food is mediocre, the staff is very sweet, and the service is good.",

It wasn't too crowded when we arrived, so we were able to sit down pretty quickly and made our order shortly after. The food didn't take long to come out, and it smelled and tasted great! We got some roasted chicken and an order of fried sweet plantains. It looked like a good amount, but we were able to put it all down because it was delicious!

    "text": "Mediocre food and okay service.   On a Sunday afternoon, it is one of the few places in the Strip that is open. We arrived at around 3 PM and, surprisingly, all the seats were filled. There is a sign by the desk that says please take a seat, so we took a seat in the only open table in the corner of the place. There were about three servers in this small restaurant, but after about 10 minutes of sitting around (with no menu and no drinks), no one had visited our table yet. So we decided to be a bit more assertive and went up to the register to ask if we could get a menu. The server behind the register apologized for not having seen us and came over promptly to give us a menu and drinks. The three stars are not for this initial confusion though, because of course it is  understandable to have not seen us.   Unfortunately, the poor service continued after this initial confusion. Since we had never visited this place before, we asked our server what the recommendations were, and he just listed off all the specials on the menu... After looking through the Yelp review to figure out what was actually good here, we ended up ordering half a rotisserie chicken and a pulled pork special with sides of rice and beans.   The rotisserie chicken - 3.5 stars To be honest, it just tasted like a regular rotisserie chicken I can buy from the grocery store, except the meat was slightly more fatty and more tender. The spices and flavors were pretty subdued; I was not impressed.   Pulled pork - 4 stars I enjoyed the pulled pork more than the chicken. There was more flavor and it was very juicy and tender.   Side of beans - 2 stars Did they just heat up canned beans and serve it on a plate because that is what it tasted like to me...  Side of rice - 4 stars I liked the rice quite a bit. I think it had some taco seasoning or something in it. I recommend pouring the leftover juices from the pulled pork and chicken into the rice!  The food came out really fast, which we really appreciated. However, after we finished, we had some leftover and wanted to get a to go box. We talked for a bit while waiting to see if a server would come and check on us. But after about 15 minutes, there was still no server that had visited us. We then spent 10 more minutes trying to catch the attention of one of the three servers in order to get a to go box and pay. One of the servers saw us and told us that he would be there after he helped another customer but went to go talk to the other server and ignored us.   Unless you are desperate for quick food in the Strip I would not recommend this place.",

Yes, my friend this is the reality of Chicken Latino.   The yuca fries are just as delicious. They are crispy on the outside and dense on the inside and I could probably eat them for every meal and never tire of them. Do yourself a favor and mix some of the homemade green sauce with some mayo, then use that concoction as a dip for the fries.   You're welcome.",

They have a signature pepper sauce they make in-house which lets you kick things up a notch on the heat scale. The fried plantains are also highly-recommended either as an appetizer or as a dessert.

    "text": "I just had my first, and quite lovely stop at Chicken Latino.  Let me tell you why...  I got the 1/4 chicken, beans and rice as it seemed to be the house special/standard.  I must say, the Chicken was quite tasty.  Perfectly cooked with a semi-crispy skin that was full of juicy herbal flavor.  A decent side of rice and black beans with some (spicy) green salsa made for a well-rounded meal.  I wouldn't claim it be ginormous, though, as a previous poster said.  I also had a freshly made strawberry-limeade, while a bit on the pricey side it was worth it.  There were strawberry seeds in the bottom of my glass and half a squeezed lime, a good sign it was made from whole ingredients and not a syrup or some such thing.  I don't normally get anything but water, so this was a nice surprise.  I'll be back to try the pork.",

But the best dish was the Peruvian-style roasted pork. Juicy and flavorful, it can't be beat with a bit of lime & chimichurri. Plan accordingly: the pork and ceviche are typically only available on Saturdays. They also have simple items like burgers and chicken tenders, so there are alternatives for children and unreasonably picky eaters. Also, there's a BYOB sign in the window, though I've never brought alcohol.",

It's not fancy or upscale, but tremendously good food at cheap prices.  $5.00 for 1/4 chicken w/2 sides (black beans and rice). Fried Plantains were just like my grandmother's. They mainly serve chicken, but they also carry other traditional food (burgers, chicken sandwiches, etc).  Highly recommend it if you're in the mood for something cheap, something good, and something a little different.  I found Munch's column to be very accurate: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.post-gazette.com%2Fpg%2F07319%2F833891-242.stm&s=98f095c2dd0f8f496cc6894f20c3d17d70697149fa7f5f093d1c3d4bbadb882f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">post-gazette.com/pg/0731...</a>",

The chicken, which is advertised as being roasted for a day, is perfectly seasoned and still so tender. I'm a huge fan of fried chicken myself, but these roasted ones I'd say are just as equally delightful.  What really makes the chicken perfect though is the salsa verde, which when mixed with some mayo make the perfect dip for both the chicken and the yucca fries. I highly recommend it!

And if you're looking to watch some soccer its a fun place to do that in the Strip.  The service is always super friendly and quick and they make you feel like you've come home for a meal.  If home is a Peruvian mom who makes delicious chicken.  You definitely forget for a bit that you are in Pittsburgh with the decor and overall feel of the place.

I am going to go back to try to chicken kabobs as they did not have them the day I was there. The atmosphere is really laid back and the decor is very mediocre. If the kabobs are good next time I come I will probably raise it to 4/5 stars, but so far 3/5 seems fair. (I do recommend the pork tho)",

Add on $2-3 for a side of yucca fries or fried plantains, and I'm in utter food heaven.  Also for the spice lovers:  Their home-made green sauce is a MUST HAVE.  Feeling adventurous?  Try the Inca pop or purple corn drink--both are refreshing.  Shelbin (the owner) is the sweetest restauranteur I've ever met--She will make you feel at home in this undiscovered little gem on the Strip.  I moved to Pittsburgh from California about 3 months ago and Chicken Latino is by far my favorite spot to eat--There will always be a spot in my heart (and tummy) reserved for Chicken Latino.",

The side of rice was ordinary but the steak fries were surprisingly good.   They were big, crispy and generous.   The chicken quesodilla was OK.  The portion was large but contained too much dark meat for me.  FYI, tip at the register or bring some cash along because it appeared to be self serve and i didn't put a tip on my card and i carried no cash yet i was waited on and served after we sat down.

Our server was very friendly and the food came out fresh,fast and hot!  I started off with a Honey Dew slushie made with fresh fruit which was amazing! I will always, always order one of those!   We ordered the plantains, jalapeno poppers and yucca fries to start. They have this homemade green chile sauce that is really delicious. We were encouraged to mix it up in some mayo as a dip for the yucca fries. I'm not a huge fan of mayo, but it cut the spiciness of the sauce just enough to be a perfect combo! I ended up dipping a little bit of everything!  We split a whole chicken and a beef platter. One came with rice and beans, the other with fries and cole slaw. The sides were all delicious, but the meat was unbelievable! Slow roasted seasoned rotisserie chicken and chunks of beef that were so tender it was falling apart!  When I have friends or family visit the burgh, this will definitely be one of the places we take them! Can't wait to go back.",

A little back story...I'm a mediana MexiCAN AmeriCAN! My father met my mother while visiting his brother at my Mom's house as foreign exchange students. They got married and created this green eyed monster! So I have a a certain expectation when dining on south of the country eats. I stand by my Mexican breakfast that takes hours of preparation, tamales from scratch (a two day process), and mortar and pestle mole recipe! I love to cook specialty dishes!  Dad was in town, I brought him here because he loves to reminisce and try things that take him back in the day. Yes this is Peruvian but all the fundamentals of Mexican cooking can be found here. Sorry Pittsburgh, but as far as Mexican restaurants go, they do not exist here! Mad Mex please! I do like the Jumbo Margaritas but refuse to order anything else besides chips.   On a side note why do I keep coming across all this Mexican bashing this week, one reviewer said they don't eat meat in \"Mexican restaurants\" and someone else in talk was on some senseless rant about Arab and Mexican who knows what? It didn't make sense anyway. It's so off putting. These people are \"loco\"  Today as a special they had a slow roasted beef served in a burrito or soup special. Last time I was here I tried the slow roasted pork. It was sensational. The specialty of the house is a slow roasted rotisserie chicken. I thought my Dad would like that but he didn't want the chicken on the bone. I hadn't thought of that. So you can order 1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken!! woops....  I asked about the beef and how we wanted a platter and they offered to make us a platter with rice and beans! We squirted some lime over the meats and happily assembled our piping hot corn tortillas. Success! Another great experience, with tender beef and all the tasty trimmings! Plus the cilantro spicy sauce. YUM!",

    "text": "If you're up for casual, no-frills dining with absolutely delicious, filling, and inexpensive food, Chicken Latino is definitely for you!  The menu is basically built around the most delicious roasted Peruvian chicken that ever was.  I thought Boston Market chicken was made with crack, but no, this must be.  Peace out, Boston Market.  This chicken is juicy, tender, and excellently spiced and herbed.  I usually get a 1/4 or 1/2 roasted/rotisserie chicken, but you can get the chicken in other dishes like rice and bean bowls, burritos, quesadillas and sandwiches.  There are combo meals with rice and beans or coleslaw and fries.    If you like spicy, the spicy green sauce served on the side is a must.  The staff recommends adding some mayo to the sauce to dumb down the spice a little, to dip fries or yuca fries in.  It's perfect.    Speaking of, the yuca fries are very good. Fried perfectly but not heavy or oily.  Doesn't appear breaded so, since I try to avoid gluten, this seemed like a good bet.  And it was!    The staff is friendly and quick and the overall experience is quite wonderful.  I recommend to anyone with a stomach.  Truth.",

    "text": "Chicken Latino is easily my favorite place to eat in the Strip and is one of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh. Their fried burritos are crunchy and gooey on the inside and, with a splash of their verde sauce, taste like heaven.  Their rotisserie chicken is seasoned well and goes well with their black beans and spanish rice.  What really steals the show and is my undisputed favorite item on the meny is their carnitas. They're only served on the weekends but they're delicious. Fork tender and with a bit of fat for flavor, put a bit in your fresh tortilla with some rice and beans and a splash of verde for heat. What happens is what I suspect occurs right before you take your first breath; this otherworldly sense of peace.  Everyone working there is great, too. They do a good job waiting tables in what I consider a casual eatery, not a place that you'd expect such good service.  Definitely try their horchata and tres leches cake, too. Yum.

The food tasted good going down (chicken, rice, beans and plantains  although they were doused in grease) but now my stomach hates me.   Overall it was an okay experience until we noticed that we were charged an extra dollar for salsa and sour cream to accompany the burrito we ordered.  I understand that some sauces/garnishes are extra but she asked my beau if he wanted it without mentioning that there's an extra charge.  Most places will at least give you that courtesy.  Can't say we'll be back here...it was cheap but not nearly as good as the Peruvian restaurant in Shadyside.",

Tons of chicken and steak fries on top of it, and then a mountain of cheese. Simply wonderful. And the green chili sauce makes everything better, and can clear out your sinuses.",

We shared the half chicken with rice and beans and the chicken burrito. Thanks to the giant portions, it was more than enough food for two hungry adults, our active three-year-old, and a to-go box. We LOVED the Peruvian chicken. It was amazingly juicy and flavorful. The quesadilla is just packed filled of rice, beans, and chicken. It's enormous, and every bite is oozing with cheesy deliciousness.  The service is fast and seamless. The owner and servers are so nice and adorable. We chatted a little with them about their business while they cleaned up the store for the night.  We'll be back very soon!",

The location is also great--just across the street from Pamela's and 21st Coffee in the strip district.  I've met a couple of people who LOVE it.    So why only, 'A-Ok'?  It's just hard for me to give someone 4 stars for an egg burrito.  Not their fault.  And I'm not going to get excited about a place during non-rush hour when it's empty.    Service was good and the salsa was spicy.    I was on the phone the whole time while I was eating, which was rude.  And talking the whole time means I wasn't paying attention to either the place or my meal.  But again, it was an egg burrito.  I just needed to eat.  Isn't that okay?  I'll be back.  And I'm really on a crusade to say that A-Ok is perfectly honorable as a review.",

It was moist and tender and had the right amount of seasoning.  I got the quarter chicken with spanish rice and black beans as sides.  Those were also great.  The green chile sauce was amazing as it enhanced the flavor of the chicken.    We also split some homemade chips and salsa which were also very good.    I also got the inca kola which just completed the whole meal.  It is very cheap too!!

Think starchier french fries). I used to go here about 3-4 times per week when I worked in the Strip and I never once got sick of it. The staff are always friendly and amazing. Their ceviche won over my Peruvian friend who had been visiting while their lomo saltado and black beans had my other friends immediately hooked. My Mexican friend said that they were the best black beans he's ever had and I would have to agree. The plantains are perfectly cooked every time as well. The chicken is simple in theory, but in trying to duplicate it's perfection I have not once come close.  I would seriously be here every single day if I could convince the fiance that it was a good idea. They are always consistent in being delicious and the only complaint I could have would be that aren't also located in Crafton!",

Staple sides of rice and beans are also quite tasty. Atmosphere is nothing special, just the fast food standard, but that's expected for the price. We ordered take-out and they wrapped the containers in saran wrap, keeping our food extra warm. If you're feeling adventurous you can order the bubble gum-flavored, mountain dew-colored Inca Kola here. Worth trying at least once, and perhaps not more.",

Chicken was well seasoned and juicy, rice was well-prepared and beans were scratch-made.  The real surprise was the pulled pork - outstanding!  Very deep flavor and tender.  Definitely worth a look.  I do wish there was also a salad or a slaw to offset the richness, but I think it wasn't ordered in lieu of additional pork (I'm not complaining either).

I love your rotisserie chicken and its immaculate seasoning.   Okay, for real now -- this place rules. It's a no-frills kinda joint, but damn, the food is good.

I moved back from San Fran, and of course it's overflowing with great food -- especially ethnic cuisine -- but I know in my heart that Chicken Latino could open a branch right in the Mission District and thrive. THRIVE!  Bonus: They have outdoor seating so you can enjoy the warm weather while it lasts, they're dog-friendly and will bring your pup out a bowl of water, and they're now open later, so you can call ahead to order dinner and pick it up on your way home from work!",

Compared to what I was looking for, this was pretty good. It left me wondering what wasn't quite the same as I'm used to. But I ordered a half chicken intending to have leftovers. And nothing was leftover. So whatever it was, the chicken was still damn good!  The menu threw me but I guess I can wrap my brain around it. Instead of filling the rest of the menu with Peruvian dishes I was looking for, they threw in some generic \"Mexican\" items. It's like going to a french restaurant that offers Polish food too. Hell it's all European. But I bet they would have too many people griping about how it can't be authentic latin food if it isn't wrapped in a tortilla, so I get it. Kinda!  And do get the hot green stuff and pour it on everything. It would make dry toast taste good!",

The menu is on the small side, but that doesn't matter if you're looking for delicious chicken or burritos.  Their rotisserie chicken is moist, delicious, and cheap. Less than $7.00 for 1/4th rotisserie chicken with 2 sides (black beans, Spanish rice, coleslaw, fries). It is more than enough for lunch for one person.  I always get the soft chicken burrito when I go there. The chicken burrito is huge and I love it. When they serve it, it's just one foil-wrapped burrito in an empty looking basket and you think to yourself, 'that's it?\", but as soon as you unwrap it and pick it up to take a bite, you realize this thing has to weigh at lease one pound. It's a beast of a burrito. Packed with chicken, Spanish rice, black beans, and cheese.  It's difficult to eat the entire thing, but I always make sure I do. Have you ever had that feeling where you are so full that you can't possibly take another bite, but you do it anyway because the food is so delicious?

Nonetheless, we found the best view of the soccer game and ordered our food. I munched on some yuca fries while waiting for my quesadilla. (If you've never tried them, they are a lot like french fries but, with a slightly different consistency.) Within a few minutes, our entrees arrived. My quesadilla was jam packed with cheese, chicken and rice. Quite possibly the biggest quesadilla I've ever had. Hubs also raved about the Peruvian chicken.

    "text": "This is my favorite place in the Strip District. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh, the service is fast and the price is right. I've had their fried plantains, yucca fries, fried burrito and rotisserie chicken. I would recommend all of them and the chicken is extremely moist!!! And last but not least, their green hot sauce is amazing and you can buy a container to go. Two thumbs up",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my fiance for lunch after we had been shopping in the Strip District.  I have been wanting to come here since I had noticed that it opened.  Whenever we walked up to the restaurant we were sad to see that the outdoor seating was already full as it was a beautiful day outside.  As soon as we walked inside we were greeted by a host, sat down and given menus.  The inside isn't too much to look it as it has a large counter with the menu on the wall on one side of the restaurant and a number of tables with chairs on the other side that could probably sit about 30 people or so.  As we were looking over our menus one of the outdoor tables got up and was cleaned and so we quickly asked our waiter if we could move out to it and he agreed.  The seats ended up making a great place for people watching especially on a busy Saturday in the strip.   For my lunch entree I decided to order the pulled pork in peruvian spices and also tried to get a side of yucca fries with it while my fiance went with the 1/4 chicken and regular fries.  I was told that neither the yucca fries nor plantains were considered side items with the entrees and so I instead picked the steak fries while also ordering the yucca fries as an extra side.  Our meals came out within a reasonable amount of time and with it came a green chile sauce that our waiter warned us was pretty hot.  Now I am a guy that loves hot stuff and he was right, this stuff was pretty hot.  He did also tell us that a lot of people like to mix the sauce with mayo to make a great dipping sauce and his advice was spot on.  Whenever my meal arrived I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with the amount of food that I got, especially the pork.  The first few bites of the pork were moist but missing something and so I put the chili sauce on it which was nice.  However as I started getting closer to the bottom I noticed that there was a garlic type sauce underneath the pork which was absolutely fantastic.  I made sure to dip the rest of my pork and fries into that and even some of the yucca fries as well.  Having both the yucca fries and potato fries at our table made eating both sets pretty unique as it was easy to compare and contrast.  Both sets tasted pretty good but the yucca fries were much firmer while also having a little bit more taste. Whenever all was said and done my fiance and I ended up ordering too much food and had to take some of both kinds of the fries home.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Chicken Latino is more than reasonably priced and I loved everything that we ordered here.  My only regret is that I would have found that garlic sauce a bit earlier so that all of my pork would have been as good.",

    "text": "Love Chicken Latino!  I used to go here about every week when I worked in the strip.  There is something to be said about their Peruvian, but what ultimately got me hooked was their hot green chili sauce... mouth watering as I type.  I usually would just get a 1/4 a chicken and douse it with the sauce.  I seriously held the bottle for the entire duration of my meal and if I had left overs, I would get a container of it to go! Delicious... I really don't eat any of their other food, though I had friends that had their Quesadilla and it looked really good.  I have eaten their burrito and wasn't super impressed.  Too much rice and filler and not not enough chicken, so I just stick with the pure chicken and I am never disappointed, especially drenched in the green sauce!",

The fries were pretty standard and crisp, just add salt and they are pretty good.  I thought the prices were very good.  Sorry I didn't see the plantains on the menu until after I was finished, they looked pretty good.",

    "text": "Friends and I were looking for a quick bite before walking around the strip so we stopped into Chicken Latino. We entered thinking it was more of an order at the counter and go situation rather than a seated service, but that ended up not being an issue as the service was fast, friendly, and efficient.   A friend and I had the Peruvian Chicken, while other had the quesadilla's. Our food was good, but nothing mind blowing. The chicken was flavorful and tender, and the sides were fine. I tried mine with a little bit of their green salsa, which was good, but way hotter than I was ready for.   Overall I liked Chicken Latino, I just don't know that I would make a trip out of my way for it.",

    "text": "Cheery little place in the Strip District for Peruvian chicken, which I had not really heard about before. We decided to give this place a try after seeing the positive Yelp reviews, and I do think that the chicken here lives up to the acclaim. Definitely a lot more tender and less dry than a normal rotisserie chicken. We got the half and two sides, the Spanish rice and black beans. Both went well with the meal. Also ordered the jalapeno poppers separately, which were good, although a tad on the cheesy side.  This is definitely a nice place to go to if you aren't in the mood for too much food or variety. Other than chicken they also serve a few other items like burritos or sandwiches, so we might try those next time. Waiters and waitresses are very friendly, and atmosphere is in general pleasant.",

    "text": "The wraps look good, so do the burritos, the Tres Leches cake sounds amazing! Unfortunately, I can't tell you anything about them because of this old gluten issue. Let me tell you about what I can have...salad and the famous Peruvian chicken.  First, the Peruvian chicken. Maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't get what makes this any different than a rotisserie chicken at Giant Eagle or Boston Market. Don't get me wrong, not that there's anything wrong with it, it just doesn't live up to the hype. It's good chicken, just nothing to rave or write home about.   Salads? The same. Good, but not great. Perfectly acceptable to pick up on a quick trip to the Strip.  The surroundings are clean, bright and spacious!",
