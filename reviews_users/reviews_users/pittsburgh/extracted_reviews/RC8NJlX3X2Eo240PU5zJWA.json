    "text": "Ive been a fan of the Pleasure Bar from it the 60's ...it's current owners have kept some of the classic PB dishes,  along with their outstanding new menu.   My only complaint is that service is sketchy at best.  Having to ask for set ups, for water, for bread, for menus.....just turns me off.  Our party of 4 had a variety of entrees, all were good, but were missing 'something'.  Salad dressing was incorrect, soup was given to wrong person, cheese for pasta came after the dish was almost finished.  We were told that the larger beer glasses were dirty and we had to take a smaller glass!  The servers were frazzled, and surly....not a great combo.   So if you want a great meal in Bloomfield, and don't mind service that is sub par, try the PB.",

    "text": "All right, people.  Can we all please finally shake off the illusion that Bloomfield has amazing Italian restaurants?  Granted, I haven't been to *all* of them, but I've been to most of them and for the mediocre Pleasure Bar to be the best of them is just sad.    The real problem here:  This is food for fat people.  Lots of fried stuff.  Lots of oil.  Yeah, those potato balls were delicious, but dear god were they heavy.  I guess I should have expected fried balls of mashed potatoes to be heavy, but of course there wasn't just potato in there.  There was cheese and I think I even detected some mayonnaise.  This is definitely a \"sometimes food.\"  A delicious, heavy sometimes food.  Now, full disclosure:  I'm a vegetarian and restaurants are always a completely different experience for vegetarians.  So if you're not veg, you may want to take all of this with a grain of salt.  They may do meat dishes spectacularly.  But vegetarians, take note.  Italian restaurants aren't really known for making decent veg food and this place is no different.  I had the portabello mushroom sandwich.  First off, the sandwich would have been better had the bread been toasted.  However, it was very soft and airy - not something I'd expect from ciabatta.  The mushrooms tasted like they had been marinated in Kraft Zesty Italian, cooked in more Kraft Zesty Italian and then topped with Kraft Zesty Italian.  This was by far the oiliest sandwich I've ever had.  To make it worse, there was too much cheese - two thick slices of provolone.  Am I the only who has noticed that too much cheese on things is a real problem in Pittsburgh?    On the positive side, the bartender was very attentive and very polite.  Also, the beer selection was good.  I'd definitely drink here, but eating here, eh, not so much for me.",

We love the food, but since the place changed hands, the atmosphere just hasn't been the same. The new owners removed a wall between the bar and one of the main dining rooms, and now eating dinner there has become an unpleasant experience. My husband and I were recently seated in the \"barlike\" dining room and were unable to hear ourselves speak over the din of the juke box and bar patrons. I wish the owners would wise up to the fact that a bar and restaurant can co-exist, but the patrons of each have different needs. This makes me sound like some kind of elderly curmudgeon, but I'm in my late twenties. Next time we'd like to have a quiet, leisurely dinner, we'll go elsewhere.",

    "text": "In our travels back to Pittsburgh to see family whenI grew up, we would always go to the Pleasure Bar for dinner at least one night we were there.  I am sure that's where my love of Italian food came from.  Even going back farther than that, my parents went there in the 50's all the time. They knew the (owner?) Johnny Collinger and spent many a night having a good time there.  I remember Johnny still worked behind the bar when I went there as a kid in the 70's and he remembered me when I went there with my parents and would always make me a Shirley Temple with extra cherries in it.  (Good customer service is important to kids too! LOL)  So know that you know my family history with the PB, I will tell you that we just recently went back there with my mother who is now 84 on a recent trip back to PA.  The food was still very good but maybe not quite as good as I remember.  Nothing was bad and to be fair, we only split the eggplant parm sandwich and the meatball sub between the table.  The meatball sub was good, but I think the meatballs could have had a bit more flavor.  We also ordered an order of potato balls which used to be the family favorite back in the day. They were still good, but MUCH less cheese in the middle than in the past.  Pleasure Bar - add some more cheese to the potato balls and they will be a standout favorite on your menu and you could be famous for them.  I'd also like to see them bring back a past favorite sandwich called the PB Special. It was nothing more than a hamburger with Italian sauce on it and mozzarella cheese but the combination was outstanding.  I remember ordering that many times as a kid.  I like that fact that the bread is still made fresh (you can tell when you eat it).    The Pleasure Bar is still worth checking out for sure.",

Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said \"I don't know, 20 to 30 minutes.\" He was so rude and huffy. We left because of how unhelpful the staff was.

When we got here, it was a pretty long wait, but luckily they have a pretty rocking bar here equipped with many TVs and plenty of booze.  Once we sat in the classic Itlaian looking dining area, our waitress came over, and we were starving.  The greens and beans were delicious.  I was suprised to find out it was only made with lettuces rather than traditional escarole, but it was delicious.  Entrees were also great.  I ordered the half portion of salmon, so I can account for portion size there, but it was great!  Asparagus was delightful.  My parents both got a pasta dish, and there was plenty to share because these plates were packed.    I would definitley suggest this place.  You know it is a good deal when my dad gets the check and his first words are, \"That's all?!\"  So with that being said, it is pretty affordable too.",

Unfortunately, the food went down hill after the potato balls. Combinations 1,2, and 3 were ordered and everyone had the same kind of reaction toward their dish \"it's not bad\" I think would be the most accurate sentence used towards the meal. All of the sauces were kind of flavorless and boring along with the pastas all being over cooked adding to the \"meh\" effect of the meals.   At the end of the evening I gave The Pleasure Bar three stars for not necessarily being bad but not being good. I am willing to give it another shot and hope that it improves before that.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 months now and I've heard SO much about how Pleasure Bar is the greatest Italian in Bloomfield (aka the entire city, since Bloomfield IS the Little Italy here). I finally decided tonight that I had to try it for myself.  While the food is above average, the ambiance does leave a little to be desired. The evening started out with a bread basket, which was (oddly) comprised of three somewhat bland pieces of white bread and about 20 little squares of butter. Very strange. Even in my most gluttonous days, I find it impossible to average 6+ squares of butter per slice of bread, but maybe that's just me.  My dish, the linguini with house-made cream sauce and mushrooms, came with a soup or salad, of which I chose the broccoli and cheddar soup. As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see plenty of options on the menu for me to choose from. The broccoli and cheddar soup was rich and creamy, albeit a bit salty for my taste. The linguini however, was great. I could immediately tell the sauce was homemade - it had a certain fresh and rich flavor that pre-packaged sauce tends to lack. (Unfortunately, I'm sure the amount of calories I consumed in that dish reflected the amazingly rich flavor, but I'll just ignore that.) As pleased as I was with my own menu luck, I found my boyfriend's dish - the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce - to be a tad bit lackluster. The pomodoro sauce and the gnocchi itself were forgettable. While I loved my own dish, the lack of consistency throughout the menu makes ordering a bit difficult.  Overall, this is a pretty good neighborhood Italian restaurant that is priced rather decently. If you aren't adverse to a bit of cheesy mom-and-pop restaurant decor, I recommend it.",

Conversations at nearby tables could be here heard so clearly that I felt compelled to respond on several occasions. A bit of Italian music in the background would have gone a long way toward setting the mood and preventing some serious mastcation irritation. I ordered manicotti and my wife ordered the eggplant parmesan. Serving size was just about right. The food was good, the sauce was excellent. The service was great. The main point of the irritation for me came when we received the bill. The food prices were fair...$12 for the parm and $14 for the the manicotti, but my wife had also ordered a glass of house Pino without asking the price. $13.75!!  I thought surely that it had to be a mistake. I mean it wasn't even a big pour, not even a decent wine glass. Not sure what kind it was but I'm thinking Woodbridge or the one with the kangaroo on the label, certainly not top shelf. I asked the waitress about the price (appearing quite the cheapass since im sure that the entire dining room could hear me despite my attempts to the contrary given the aforementioned acoustics) and she said \"nope it's not a mistake\". So I guess the moral of the story is to ask the drink prices before ordering ......or maybe just have yourself a nice glass of iced tea",

Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \"homemade\" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated.",

The place has a large, older TV in the side dining room (which sort of smells like cat pee) - but is pretty good for watching any sporting event.  Service here is always iffy.  Do not request Molly as your server.  While she is quick to get your order, she is otherwise completely inattentive and unfriendly to the point of borderline rudeness.  I have had much better service here from other servers.  I give the food 4 stars, but the service and decor brings it way down to a two.  The place is worth the price for a lunch portions (to-go, of course), but probably not worth a sit down dinner.",

    "text": "Awful. Just awful. My boyfriend and I went to dinner here last Saturday. We were craving Italian so we agreed to try somewhere in Pittsburghs little Italy. We looked around Bloomfield and decided on this place. With a menu boasting Italian favorites, we thought this would be great. Nope. He ordered the veal parmigiana and I got the seafood Alfredo. His entree came with a wedding soup that was ok...but when the server brought it, the crackers fell to the worn, dirty carpet and she picked them up and put them on the table...gross. Our food took forever and when it got there I was highly disappointed. My Alfredo was tasteless. No salt or cheese, just a bland bechamel. The shrimp were clearly previously frozen as well as the \"scallops\" that were tiny and rubbery. The veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par. We tried to push through but couldn't. We should have turned around when we saw the dated less then clean looking decor, but didn't. We will never be back and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "We just got back from our dinner at the Pleasure Bar. I ordered eggplant parmesan, starting with wedding soup. The soup was pretty good, although a tiny bit oily and a tiny bit salty. The eggplant parmesan came in a hearty portion with penne and pomodoro sauce. Their sauce is just the right amount of sweet and I enjoyed it. The eggplant was tasty and well seasoned, but a bit chewy around the edges. The prices are very reasonable, and the wait staff was friendly and approachable. The decor is a little PIer One but that's forgivable.   I didn't deduct any stars for this since it's *technically* a special circumstance, but the only downside of the night was that the servers sat down to wrap silverware by turning the TV on really loud right behind us to the series finale of Lost, which I had planned on watching at a later date. Talk about a spoiler alert!   Is this the BEST Italian food in the area? Probably not. But I'm also no expert on Italian food. In all, I found it tasty and a definitely a good value for the price.",

    "text": "After browsing through our reviews at Pittsburgh Hot Plate, I noticed that we have been lacking in reviews of Italian restaurants!  We have done several pizza reviews (thanks Katie Lane) but have yet to let our readers know what we think of local Italian fare. Well, that's all about to change, because we did venture out to Bloomfield in search of authentic Italian cuisine.  There are so many restaurants in the Italian section of Pittsburgh that it can be difficult to choose just one.  We narrowed our search down to a few local spot,s then ultimately chose a small place by the name of The Pleasure Bar.  It's not exactly Italian sounding right?  Well, we found out that prior to being the Pleasure Bar it was called Marianni's.  Apparently some new owners decided to change the name to lure more customers in the doors.   We arrive shortly after 6pm, and were led into a private dining room in the back of the restaurant.  Along the way we passed a large bar, and another dining area to the right.  Our seating area was nice- very clean with colored carpets, several tiffany lamps, tablecloths, and black cloth napkins... so far so good.  Our waiter arrived, took the drink order and was off again.  By the time he arrived with our beverages, we had decided on entrees:  Eggplant parmesan, Chicken Parmesan, two bowls of Wedding Soup, Pesto Pasta, and a fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad.  I also ordered a dinner salad with bleu cheese.  \"Sir, would you like fries with that Chicken Parm?\"  What???  Fries with Italian food?  That's like ordering pizza at a Chinese restaurant.  We waited over 20 minutes for our salads to arrive, which was a drag because I was famished.  The greens were fresh, and the tasty bleu cheese dressing was home-made.  The salad was also topped with black and green olives, tomatoes, and shave parmesan cheese.  The soup was average. Fresh bread and butter were also served. Our entrees arrived two minutes after we had finished our salads and soup.  The portions at The Pleasure Bar are very large, so you may want to consider sharing an entree.  The Chicken Parmesan came with a thick layer of melted cheese on top, and plenty of red sauce.  The breaded chicken was tender and fried golden-brown.  The French fries were heavily seasoned, and crispy.  Pesto Pasta was next... the sauce was bright green and fresh- very tart, and full of garlic, cheese and pine nuts.  It was a good dish overall, but the pasta was overcooked.  Eggplant Parmesan is one of my favorites.  This entree is similar in preparation to the Chicken Parm, but doesn't have the heavy layer of melted cheese on top.  The eggplant was thinly sliced, deep fried, and covered with tart tomato sauce.  The portion was enormous, and we ended up taking more than half of it home.  Fresh mozzarella and tomatoes are always nice on a hot summer evening, and this dish didn't disappoint.  The cheese was soft and smoky, and the tomatoes were dark red, meaty, and full of summer zest.  The only downside; there were too many scallions on top. The Pleasure Bar is a nice place to eat.  It's a family oriented spot with soft music, and a friendly atmosphere.  The food is pleasant, but lacks authenticity at times. Entrees are between $12.00 and $15.00. Happy Cooking!

    "text": "Top of my list for a late lunch today. While  attending the Italian festival in Bloomfield last September I tried the polenta and meatballs, with a meatball sandwhich! I love meatballs and these ones were well seasoned, juicy, and soaked in a great marinara sauce. I occasionally get cravings for these meatballs and today was the day.   A couple of months ago I tried to go on a Sunday and they were closed. It was a cold, snowy Sunday so I thought they were closed because I showed up pretty late plus the bad weather. I attempted to go again today but to my dismay they are always closed on Sundays which I would have seen if I had checked my yelp app. BOOO!   Three stars so far... because of the great meatballs! Points lost for being closed on Sundays. Who is closed on Sundays?? Crucial Lazy Sunday dining revenue is being squandered! They must be busy enough and don't need the extra business day. Wait for an update because I'LL BE BACK!",

Note to self: Order something with meat next time. The hubby's meat pasta really was a lot better... and, thank goodness, he let me have a bite or my entire view would be based solely on the gnocchi.

    "text": "Some friends and I were here Friday, August 22nd. It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed really understaffed which was strange since it was Little Italy Days.  Once we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.  Two other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was a little over 2 hours. Would never consider going back.  The food was good.",

    "text": "Ah, Pleasure Bar. Yes, this place looks like it hasn't been updated for many decades. However, I find that kind of charming -- I imagine all of the steel workers of yore, boots dirty and hands ragged, gathering at the local watering hole after a long day's work to unwind with their neighbors and enjoy a cold pint and some good food.  Anyway, I digress. I've been to the Pleasure Bar several times, and I have always left relatively satisfied. I've never encountered any service issues, and the food has always been decent. Now don't get me wrong -- the food isn't super modern, light, amazing Italian cuisine. It is, however, good \"Pittsburgh Italian\" --  and by that I mean that many of their dishes are heavier, richer, and more dense. Yes, I just made up the term \"Pittsburgh Italian\", but for a city that puts french fries on its salads, I think it fits. For example, one of their more popular and delicious appetizers is their potato balls -- as the name suggests, these are deep fried balls of mashed potatoes. Delightfully crispy on the outside, and warm, smooth and creamy on the inside. Their gnocchi is delicious, but very dense -- it's not the light, pillow-y type of gnocchi that some other Italian restaurants serve. That being said, I have no problem with starchy, dense gnocchi. I often get it tossed with mafalda sauce, which is one of their signature sauces that is a combination of marinara and alfredo. Sinful!!  So yeah, their food is the type of food that is rich and delicious, but you're definitely not going to be running a 5k after eating it (then again, running a 5k is overrated anyway ;) )   So for what it is, I think Pleasure Bar's food is actually pretty good. However, the last three times that I've visited, I've had -- hmm, how to say this politely? -- \"intestinal issues.\"  The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but then I went again a few weeks later, and once again it was a gastrointestinal race to the finish home. I gave it one final try, but met the same fate.  So there is clearly something about their food that doesn't agree with me (and for the record, this doesn't ever happen anywhere else). To be fair though, it's very possible that my body is just weird, because in all cases my dining partners have not gotten ill.  So I'm kind of torn -- my brain wants to give Pleasure Bar 4 stars, maybe 4.5, because I really do like their food. But my GI tract wants to give them a 1 or a 2. So I'll split the difference and go with 3.",

Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy.   Same one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \"give me a second I have to get this for these people first\"  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing.   On the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it.",

He was very attentive when we were ordering, and why wouldn't he be there were a total of 6 other people in the restaurant.   Starting out with a few apps we went with the crab stuffed mushrooms and the Italian egg rolls. Both were delicious! We both got a side salad, nothing to write home about. and then there was the main Course. We shared a dish of their Malfalda Pasta which is a Mixed Red and white sauce. I couldn't stop eating.

    "text": "The Pleasure Bar is absolutely not a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars from me bc every time I've dined there I've left happy, full of delicious food, and not broke.  Everyone in Bloomfield knows about the Pleasure Bar, but I'm not sure anyone outside of Bloomfield knows about it.  It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.  I have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!  Is this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.  Heres what we had to eat last night:  the tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.  My friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)  I ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.  the salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.  My friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.  My friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box.   We were too full to have dessert.  Our check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.  this restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.  I highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.

It also came with the choice of french onion soup (can also get italian wedding) or salad. I had the french onion soup; tons of cheese which i love. We also ordered fried zucchini strips as an appetizer. I normally don't like zucchini but they were so thin and the breading was just right",

    "text": "I've been making an effort to try more places in the city, and I had a chance to try Pleasure Bar last week. A friend of mine is a regular there and it came highly recommended.   I have to be in the mood for Italian, but it was really good. Friend had the chicken noodle soup, which I had a taste of, and it was delicious. Ranch dressing is my default condiment, and theirs is to die for. I was dipping bread in ranch after I had finished my salad. Speaking of, the Italian bread was fresh and delicious. Even the butter was great, despite coming from those little containers with the peel off top. Then we had the potato balls. Come on, you can't go wrong with balls of fried potatoes and cheese. They were really good. I had chicken parm and couldn't believe the size of it. After bread, salad, and potato balls, I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. While it was good, I thought that my friend's carbonara was better. That's what I'll be getting next time.   I ordered stuffed shells with a meatball to take to my mom. She used to frequent Pleasure Bar in her younger days and said the food is as good as it was back then. I also got her a slice of chocolate cake, which she loved, although it's more of a dark chocolate.   Service was great, but to be fair, it wasn't busy at 6pm on a week day. I agree that the decor is a little dated. It definitely has an Old Pittsburgh feel, which I don't mind at all.   I'll be back the next time I'm in the mood for Italian!",

Nevertheless, the food is edible, but definitely not worth $20.",

I'll open with the highlights. The potato balls were yummy. Crispy on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside. There were easily the highlight of the meal. Also our desserts  were good. We had a chocolate cake, tiramisu and the lemon berry mascarpone cake. The desserts were all flavorful, sweet and yummy. The entrees, however, left much to be desired. The table order a penne Alfredo, penne malfalda, and the putenesca. I ordered the amanda pasta, which was a special. It was sauteed broccoli, zuchinni and sundried tomatoes in their aglio olio sauce. Everything tasted like nothing. I'm positive the pasta water wasn't salted. Even the putanesca, which didn't include any tomatoes, had no seasoning, which seems like an impossible feat considering its historically a salty dish. Everything was just bland and disappointing. It literally tasted like the place has given up. I likely won't go back, except maybe for some dessert, but even then, it won't be any time soon.",

We were looking to start visiting more restaurants in Bloomfield, and went last night. We always use Yelp reviews when finding a new place to eat, and ordered the potato balls. DELICIOUS! We also ordered the greens (which, in Utica, NY, is a signature dish), which had absolutely no flavor to them. The bread they served us looked unappetizing (stale). The marinara sauce for the app and raviolis tasted like it was from an industrial can. Pesto gnocchi okay, tiramisu okay (except for the canned whipped cream).",

Honestly, I don't' recall ever being displeased with service here.  It's very Pittsburgh, so if you sit at the bar you can definitely catch a game.  The dining areas can accommodate groups, and I've seen many a family in here.  When they're busy it can get noisy, but not excessive.  I have sampled just about everything on their menu.  A few of my faves:  Italian Eggrolls...mmmmm...i'm hungry just thinking about them.  Stuffed mushrooms are pretty bomb as well, and the Bruschetta Bread.  When it comes to entrees you can't go wrong with the pick your own pasta. Their sauces are homemade and oh so good.  My go-to is the pesto with angel hair.   If you're looking for a nice place, with good homemade food, this is it.  Bonus: During little Italy days they have a stand out front.  Do it.",

I could not believe the prices on the menu the first trip.  This place is CHEAP.  We started out with the bruschetta, which was ok.  Not my favorite, but I think it was four huge slices of bread and covered in garlic and tomatoes.  It was a bit greasy for my tastes but still yummy.  Then, we split the stuffed shells ($8.50) and gnocchi ($9).  Both were fantastic, I'm guessing homemade.  Other trips we have tried manicotti, deep-fried zucchini, and all sorts of other things.  The portions are a good size, and you might even have a very small portion of leftovers.  The service is slow considering we are often the only people on a Saturday at lunch time, but who cares?  We are there to talk and hang out.  This place is great, and I'll come back soon.",

The front section of this restaurant is your typical bar with great draft beer options. The back section is home to a fairly large dining room area.  The menu has your pasta and meat entree options but you can also ask for the bar menu which has many sandwich options.  On our past visit during Little Italy days we were lucky to get a seat in the dining room fairly quickly and had great service. My husband and I started with a Summer Shandy followed shortly by a bread and butter basket.  For my dinner I asked for the sandwich menu and got the meatball sub.  It comes with one side and for a small upcharge I went with the wedding soup. I was a bit disappointed with the wedding soup as it was mostly spinach and not a lot of pasta or meat. My meatball sub was terrific on a fresh roll with 2 huge meatballs topped with marinara and melted provolone cheese.  My husband ordered a pasta entree with sausage. All of the entrees come with your choice of soup or salad which is a nice bonus.   This is a great family restaurant and good for kids.",

It sounds like it should be a seedy, crude night club - and it makes it even more absurd when you walk in and find out this is an old school, old man bar with grandma's Italian dining room in the back (ruffles and floral fruit curtains included).  Aside from that (and it's a significant that) - the service was great. The food was warm and filling and homestyle just like we hoped for. A friend and I split the stuffed mushrooms appetizer, so yummy. And our salads (no iceberg - yay!) and dinners were just as good. I'm glad we checked it out. Basic Italian family dinner status, if that's what you're looking for.  But can i mention again how ill-fitting \"Pleasure Bar\" is.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here with another couple a few weeks back for a round of birthday drinks. Kyle had heard good things about Pleasure Bar from several people, so he was anxious to try it. It was a Friday night around 11:30 and this was our first stop of the night, so nobody in our group was intoxicated in either appearance or reality. (This becomes important later.)  We walked in and were greeted by a rowdy group of three men hitting on a female couple nearby and playing lots of country music on the jukebox. So far standard bar behavior for a certain demographic and nothing to be too concerned about. There was one lone female bartender and she seemed sweet enough. One friend ordered a Blue Moon and the other a Yuengling. The Blue Moon seemed super overpriced, but my boyfriend and I were undeterred and ordered up with two Dogfish Head IPAs. Score! They were significantly cheaper. (I love whoever this bar buys their beer from at least.) Around half an hour later our friends wanted a round of whiskey shots and ordered two. They handed the bartender a $20 and told her of our intention to leave immediately after. They received their two shots and nothing more. We waited fifteen or so minutes, the shots were consumed, etc. Everyone was thinking hmmm $10 shots, pricey but okay...it felt odd but we were just going to roll with it when my boyfriend stepped in and politely asked if we had any change coming. The bartender smiled, turned on her heel, went back to the register and produced the change we were owed. (I believe it was $7 total.)  I have two problems with the way things are run at Pleasure Bar. One, that bartender was all by herself and was being horribly harassed by the group of men next to us. (As in they were screaming at her, calling her a bar wench, and using sexually derogatory language.) I saw one other female staff member floating around somewhere in the back, but overall she seemed deserted. I felt terrible for her in that situation. Two, not giving polite patrons change is understandable on crazy busy nights on packed out bars, but in our situation it felt suspiciously like she'd planned on pocketing the change and I don't think that's professional. The bar had a capacity for about forty people and she only had eight or nine individuals to deal with. Nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there. With the behavior from the other group I could see her being so upset that she simply forgot our change, so I mentally tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but it still seemed pretty off. We had already tipped generously after our first round, so she had no reason to assume we wouldn't do the same for the shots. If I ever come back here I just know I'll be watching my change a lot more closely!",

    "text": "It had been 8 years or so since I last found myself in the curiously named (Mariani's) Pleasure Bar of Bloomfield, and that last dining experience was rather flat. With nothing to make for dinner, I brought Kay here one Friday afternoon for a post-workday meal and to get on with some unfinished business.  The peevish reviews the restaurant has received recently would not keep me at bay.   I'll own up to having dealt with slow service, which was inexcusable considering that the dining room was no more than half-occupied. That notwithstanding, the above average food and familial ambience made up the deficit.   Exhibit #1: The Italian Fried Greens. Amazingly, this was my first encounter with the traditional side dish. Embellished with chunky medallions of juicy sweet sausage, the wilted cabbage, chard, onions and heaven knows what else, made this a steamy salad that Kay and I shared ravenously. Adding some noodles would have turned it into haluski.   Exhibit #2: A house salad. Dressed with a properly zesty house vinaigrette, I found it cleared my palate well for what was to arrive next.   Exhibit #3: Gnocchi. Arriving at the right balance betwixt doughy and delicate, the alabaster, oval bombs of love, labor, and starch were coated with a fiendishly blood-rich tomato sauce that came close to conjuring mole, parsley also being added for effect. Customization entailed the inclusion of a mammoth of a meatball made from the purest of ground chuck with minimal filler.   Exhibit #4: Spumoni. Served sundae-style with whipped cream, it made for a delectably creamy, pistachio-hued, and generously scooped ending to what was fine Italian meal.   Kay and I basically ignored the so-so complimentary bread and the somewhat dated decor, relishing our dishes and the entertaining clientele aIike (the family sitting across from us would be good candidates for a reality television program) without a care. I suggest that my readers do the same and appreciate this venerable neighborhood eatery for what it is and for as long as it lasts.  P.S. The restaurant was clean during our visit, and we saw not one roach.",

Over the course of the next 90 minutes we received some bread,  some cabbage water with a few little meatballs,  one odd- smelling cloudy iced tea,  and numerous claims that the food would be \"right out\".  After a two-and a half hour bout of frustration we had enough and went home hungry.     I will never go here again.   The little bit of food that we had was awful,  and we never got or entrees.

While the bar area is very loud, our party was seated together in a quiet side dining room. Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable. And the kitchen can be very quick. FYI, they can't split checks for larger groups.  Now for the food. The Pleasure Bar house salad puts other restaurants' house salads to shame: mixed greens, pickled red pepper, pine nuts, mozzarella cheese, and not one but two kinds of olives. Classy. The kalamari came out hot, with a light breading and chewy center. All of the various pasta dishes we ordered were delicious, and generous servings. It's a good price if you count the leftovers.  I was pleasantly surprised and want to come back.",

We ate a light meal, as we were trying a bunch of different things from vendors at the festival. I went with a side salad, the wedding soup, and we split an order of fried zucchini. The side salad was delicious and a generous portion and the wedding soup was quite good. The fried zucchini was some of the best I've ever had! I would come back for the fried zucchini alone. Service was also wonderful during our visit. Worth a visit!",

Menu has an Italian slant and all seem to be good choices. We started with Italian egg rolls- eggplant, Capicola and mozzarella- Italian wedding soup- all excellent.  For dinner we enjoyed a salmon crab rollotini and a Capicola eggplant. Both hot, delicious and filling- good choices from a varied and lengthy menu.

Then the bill comes and the steak is still on the bill.  When I asked her about it she said she could only partially credit us because he ate the soup and broccoli that came with it.  WHAT!!!  So even though they screwed up the steak, he had to pay something.  I have never heard such a ridiculous policy.  To top off our experience, the menu said gratuity would be added for parties of 8 or more.  We had 7, and there was 20% gratuity automatically added.
