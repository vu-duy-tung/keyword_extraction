The bread and olive oil and vinegar they bring you is delicious and tempting, and the flat bread and pizza is very delectable and delicious. The pasta is fancy and tasty. The environment is welcoming and pleasant. The tiramisu is a personal favorite of mine. The tables are large and can accommodate alot of people. They also have a nice outdoor area outside the restaurant.",

I enjoy the Romano crusted chicken salad as well as the balsamic chicken salad. The Parmesan dressing is delicious, and I have even tried to recreate it at home.  I am not a big fan of the entrees here as they are loaded with salt, but I do enjoy stopping in to grab a salad while shopping at the Waterfront or catching a movie.  There is always plenty of parking, which is key.",

Big menu (which sometimes doesn't work well) offered a lil something for very different tastes.  Salmon salad was really good - I ate it pretty much without dressing - offered dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette.  Would have preferred lemon with this. But loved the crunch of the stix - sounds weird but it was good.  Daughter loved her French toast, which had a filling.  Will return if shopping in the area.  Very  reasonably priced.",

I told the waiter this is not new and improved. Last week the tiramisu looked so good I was going to try it this time.

I guess since I was so \"wrong\" about so many things, that I am just going to revoke the rating I gave you previously. Because no one likes being lied to by someone who is supposed to be inviting you in to dine with them. So yeah. Enjoy this 1 star review, you deserved it. ;)  BRB telling corporate how \"professional\" you guys act on Yelp!  Reference the following objective evidence: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foi42.tinypic.com%2F2akh2zs.jpg&s=bd7b5fdf70b1db0ea3a7cf8631f39e9c0bf4df1cc1b74251f1b4fea8b175fa78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oi42.tinypic.com/2akh2zs...</a>  PS: If you want to address a review, you make an owner account, claim this page as your own, and respond to reviews individually so that EVERYONE can see your remarks and you can't blatantly LIE to people about your products/services. Just FYI!  --------------------------  You know, I just realized--this is probably one of my only \"chain\" restaurant reviews. I usually prefer smaller, mom and pop type places or just non-chain restaurants. But Bravo! is an exception.  The food can be kinda pricey at times but my mum always saves coupons so we can all get a meal here and not break the bank too much! Also lunch menu is more reasonable prices. Just saying.  Things I have tried:  Lobster Bisque (too heavy, not worth it) Mista Salad (PERFECT salad! refreshing AND filling!) Chicken Milinase (sp?) with pomodore(sp?) sauce. (SO tasty!) \"Lobster\" and Shrimp Ravioli (not real lobster but sauce is so good!) Filet Mignon with beans and potatoes (pretty damn good but not worth the price.)  The day after, the food can be kinda oily looking which makes me wonder just HOW many calories I am consuming? LOL.  The servers are all great and friendly and they practically know us by name which is cool (or crazy, you decide.)  The desserts are amazing--I recommend the lava cake.  The alcoholic drinks seem overpriced and not worth the $ so I wouldn't really get one. Try their imported peach tea instead or a glass of lemonade. Yum!",

Rosa was my favorite. Bread and dipping sauce was ok. Nothing great. Wish I would have skipped to save the calories. Wedding soup was one of the best I have had. Calamari had no taste and was another thing I wish I could have skipped to save the calories. Service from both waiters was attentive but the table wasn't being bussed in a timely matter. The eggplant parm was bland and mediocre. One member of our party sent their food back. The service from waitstaff at the end of the evening slowed for refills of cocktails that took forever at the bar. The evening could have definitely been improved.",

Growing up in the South Hills, Bravo! was one of my favorite chains. It was fancy, it had table clothes, it was better than the Olive Garden. I recall being mildly obsessed with the chopped salad, so upon my recent return I ordered a half-sandwich and the salad for a light lunch.  I was disappointed that the salad was full of soggy ice-berg lettuce and a few off-season tomatoes. The turkey-bacon-avocado sandwich was disappointing as well, with just a few chunks of cubed avocado overwhelmed by a flavored aioli.  I guess I've been spoiled by having a huge variety of A+ Italian Bistros at my disposal,  but there is waaaay better Italian to be had in the 'burgh. Skip the big box chains and head to your local red-sauce joint. Its likely to be cheaper, more delicious, and lacking giant faux-Roman columns with doubtful structural integrity.",

I tried the call ahead before the movie started and could not get anything for a party of 5 earlier than 9. So we just walked in and got in the queue with a 1/12 - 2 hr wait. I put my name in and began using Yelp on my iPhone to find the numbers of the \"nearby' restaurants. Well darn, they all had similar wait times. So we had a drink and luckily we were seated in 1 hour. Whew. Lemon drop martinis were popular at the table last night. Everyone said they liked them. I just had a Grey Goose.  Salads were good especially the Bravo Chopped Salad which contains a delicious mix of chopped greens, cucumber, red onion, tomato, olives, Feta cheese and Italian dressing. Their Wedding soup was delicious as usual. For entrees I had Chicken Marsala which had a great tasting sauce, yummy mushrooms and moist tender chicken. I recommend this. Linda had the beef gnocchi, with slow roasted beef, which she said was wonderful and for her, there was enough to bring some home. Other had the eggplant parm, sausage tortellini and angel hair bolognese. I have had the bolognese before and I can attest to how good it is. We always enjoy Bravo even with the wait.",

We have this restaurant always as our favorite place to go when we are in the waterfront. Excellent for group gathering as it is not too loud. The only thing I always say is why don't they get the waiters a better coaching where they are not asking and interrupting all the time to ask \"  guys is all good?\", the great service of a great fine restaurant is hard to find these days. But this is the only thing I have to complain a bit about Bravo's. Always a good place to eat!!",

What I found to be unpleasant was that we were eating and the server dropped off the checks. We were not asked if we wanted dessert, which we did.  I was still eating and server asked if we were ready to pay. The  server took the money from my friend while I continued to eat my lunch.  There was no one waiting for tables so I can't understand what the rush was.  When I finished, I paid my check and we left.   My friend told me about the Bravo Rewards Card which I was interested in. I was advised that my visit today counted. Maybe I misunderstood because when I activated the card the visit wasn't on there. And since I paid cash, I didn't keep the receipt to possibly add on myself.  Word to the wise. Don't rush your clientele unless it is requested and refrain from offering inaccurate information. These are small inconveniences but it left a unfavorable impression about the establishment.",

I was not expecting the fish to be hanging off the plate like other notable restaurants, nor did not anticipate being served a barely two ounce piece of cod.  This is disgraceful.  I could have gotten a bigger fish sandwich at McDonalds for a quarter of the price.  Take it off the menu if you can't serve a larger portion than that. Otherwise you are just insulting your customers. I did not want to make a scene in front of the others or I would have sent it back.  Do not order this sandwich.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I waitressed for many years. Mistakes happen.  No problem. When it becomes an issue is when there is no effort to fix them.   I have been at this Bravo twice. My first experience was slow service and mediocre food. I didn't have water for most of meal, but maybe the waiter had too many tables or something.  My visit today however was highly unexceptable. We had a party of 8 around 7pm. The hostesses were nice and quickly worked on getting us a table. I sat in the arm chair in the waiting area and cut my elbow on the arm of the leather chair. There was a piece sticking out with a rough edge. I was literally bleeding on my dress and told the hostess what happened and asked for a bandaid. She got me one, but that seemed to be the extent of the investigation into the chair.  Our table was ready quickly, but it was missing a place setting. I asked for one as we ordered our drinks. We then ordered appetizers, and I asked again.  The appetizers came, and I still had not received silverware. I borrowed a fork from my friend to try to eat some of the stuffed peppers and flatbread, but we had not received any plates or serving utensils to share them. After 5 minutes of not seeing someone to ask for plates, we decided to eat the aps before they got cold.  They were tasty, but the manor of which we had to eat them somewhat ruined it for me.  I eventually got my sliver wear rollup between the appetizers and the meal.  The second issue was splitting the check.  The waitress asked at the beginning of the meal how we were paying, which made sense. We asked if we could split the bill or if that would be troublesome. She said it might just take a bit longer at the end, and we said that was fine. However, every time we ordered, she complained about how hard it was to keep track of who was ordering what. I understand it is difficult, and it's no problem to have to ask us for the order twice, but I felt like I was ruining her night just by ordering. I felt so guilty and uncomfortable by the end of the meal.  The third issue was the salad. My friend ordered a large salad as his meal with the dressing on the side.  The waitress said that was fine. When she brought the salad, it had dressing on it, and my friend politely got her attention to address it.  She said he did order it without dressing and that she would bring him a cup of dressing and walked away before he could respond. She brought us out more water, and still hadn't done anything for the salad a minute later. He brought up the issue again and she apologized saying she forgot the dressing. He explained that that wasn't the problem and that the issue was he eats very little dressing due to dietary concerns.  There was too much on the salad, and that is why he ordered it on the side. She started explaining how the chefs just toss it in a little dressing, but she didn't offer any help with replacing the salad.  After a extended story about the making of the salad, my friend didn't know how to respond. She then finally asked if he wanted to order something else. He said that he wanted the salad. The waitress suddenly said (jokingly?) that he better eat all the salad or she would have him order something else.  I'm not sure if she was just not understanding that all she had to do was get him a dry salad or if she just wasn't willing to, but It seemed obvious that is what he wanted.  My friend got up, left the salad, and went to the bar for the rest of the night. He is anti-confrontational, and it was just too much.  Apparently it was 1/2 off lasagna day. You also were supposed to get a $10 gift card with your lasagna.  The waitresses told us this as she served us our food. Many of us responded that we would have liked to have lasagna then.  The waitress said that it just \"popped up on the screen\" when she put the order in and she never knows when they have special days like this.  I thought it was pretty ridiculous that we were only learning this after our food came out.  I guess she really might not have known, but it was 7pm on a Sunday. I can't imagine my friend was her first customer to order lasagna. I think it is most likely that she was just lying to us because she never bother to tell us when she should have. If it was managements' direction to not tell us, that is even more ridiculous.  I had just finished my last bite when the waitress was next to our table with boxes asking everyone if they wanted one.  Apparently they don't have desert here, because she immediately brought the bill after that.  We waited a bit long for our food, but we did have 8 people, so that is understandable. However, I would expect she would give us enough to eat it. We felt very unwelcome, and my friend had already abandon the table due to the salad issue; so, we decided to pay and leave. My friend who ordered the lasagna never did get her $10 gift card. We were going to ask about it, but we decided we wouldn't be coming back anyway.",

Our server was a younger man who honestly seemed stoned to me. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and asked if I could get extra vegetables instead of mashed potatoes and he said no problem. All we had were waters to drink but it seemed as if talking to his coworkers was a bigger priority because i sat there till our food came with an empty glass. It wasn't till our food got to the table did he notice that he forgot to let the BOH know I wanted to substitute extra veggies for the mashed potatoes. He did offer to take it back and he did bring me a side of the veggies but my issue is that with only having two tables at that moment how you could forget that. I shouldn't have to ask the manager when she comes to the table if we could get more water.",

My experience was neither excellent nor disappointing.   The restaurant decor is beautiful and I'm a sucker for places with a high ceiling. Our service was quick, almost too quick? I did not have any time to revel in the surrounding or have conversation. The point being is that I felt like a number and a turnover rate for them.   For the appetizer we opted in for the chicken bacon flatbread, which was delicious! An ideal combination of savory and crunchiness. I do recommend that. I had the lobster bisque for the soup and it came out very salty. For the entree I had the sausage tortellini. It was an excellent tasting meal but the portion size seemed small. It's possible that my expectation is Olive Garden portions but for most people the portion was probably ideal.",

My dinner-mate and myself didn't have any issues hearing eachother. Bad acoustics can sour a meal.  The margarita pizza is decent, definitely not the best I've had, but I'd consider getting it again as there are not many vegetarian choices.  They will make some substitions to accommodate vegetarians.  CONS: We weren't the only ones that noticed how chilly the temperature was inside.  They don't have many healthy-ish vegetarian options. Pasta Primavera anyone?",

So, I was seated outside and the waitress was busy and she was a few minutes late. THEN, the manager came and sincerely apologized to me, which I was not actually bothered by it at all. But honestly, this place cares a lot more about customer service!!! Which I was very pleased by his kindness. So, he insisted that my lunch is free yaay !!  Thank you so much for the great service and the delicious meal. I appreciate it. I'll definitely recommended this restaurant to everyone ifIf you are in Pittsburgh and if you want to be treated right. Good job BRAVO",

Lisa went above and beyond and here's how it went, before an early movie at Loew's:  Drinks:  We each had two and they were reasonably priced and tasty.  Salad:  We split the house salad - actually Lisa split it for us, which almost never happens.  No muss, no fuss.  Pizza:  Sausage Broccoli.  It was just the right size for (2) to split, but ONLY if you split the salad, first!  It was done to perfection, perfectly spiced and the crust was just the right mix of crisp and soft.  I'm not a fan o' the food chains, but Bravo! (and Lisa) certainly delivered a great start to our weekend.",

All of Bravo's Martinis are only $5 on Wednesday evenings, and they have several good options.  The food is very dependable. I most recently ordered the Pasta Woozie as my entree. It was just the right portion size - large enough to really fill me up but small enough that I wasn't taking a mound of noodles home as leftovers.  I look forward to dining at this Bravo again and hope that I remember to come back on Wednesday!",

Yes, the decorations are nice and the waiters very attentive, but it almost feels unnatural...unauthentic. It is on the fancier end, but prices aren't too bad. Good place for birthdays and celebrations.   I wasn't too impressed by the food. The plates were huge, but portions not so huge. The dishes had a nice set up, but the taste was average. I got their signature pasta bravo with chicken. It came with this creamy tomato sauce and pasta. They forgot to give me chicken though, and I didn't even realize that until the waiter pointed it out. So I ended up eating the additional chicken by itself because almost done with my pasta. The sauce was good, but nothing memorable. The pasta a bit too tough and undercooked for my taste. The chicken...just grilled, nothing much to say about that.   Overall, I thought Bravo was just okay. Fancy on the exterior, but lacking substance.",

    "text": "Wow absolutely disappointed with my experience today. Came here expecting high quality food as I've experienced in the past. Before the meal, I used the ladies room, which was stinky, unclean and lacking toilet paper. After telling the waitress, she rudely respond that it was the host's job to clean it, not hers. Looking forward to the appetizer, I overlooked this detail.   Until... The Ceasar salad was old, yellow soggy lettuce. The lobster bisque had maybe one piece of lobster, and it was luke warm. My \" 5 Oz Bravo steak\" was the size of a 50 cent piece. I literally looked around for the hidden camera guy to jump out and say, gotcha! I forgot to take a picture. That's how appalled I was. After politely asking the waitress about the 2 bite steak, she rudely responded that, \"I could get you a new one, but it'd be the same size.\" Talk about customer service! Not. The char on the outside was way to much. Inside however, was cooked to order, medium. The veggies were burned to an inedible crisp. My mother ordered the grilled chicken marsala, also burned to a crisp! Dry as an old shoe. The manager finally came over and agreed to take our meals off the bill. At least she knew when they screwed up. Although she made a comment that i should've spoken up sooner. Umm, I tried, but your rude waitress who clearly hates her job didn't care what I had to say.  I will definitely not be returning! If you read my other reviews, you know I always have positive ones. Unfortunately this was not the case today. So sad to see a good establishment go downhill.",

    "text": "First of all, the dishes are all arranged beautifully, though for a fancy-looking (chain though, I think?) restaurant like this, I would expect no less!  I came here with my boyfriend last year and ordered the Berries and Cream French toast off the brunch menu. It wasn't particularly memorable, but much better than french toast from places like IHOP, say. It had a fluffy texture, with no sogginess. My boyfriend thought it was far too sweet, but I liked it (I have a major sweet tooth though). He also deemed the signature Pasta Bravo! that he ordered \"delicious.\"  This year, I came alone for the free appetizer loaded onto my account and sat at the bar. I ordered the Meatballs and polenta and my gosh, it tasted AMAZING! The meatballs were tender and juicy, while the polenta underneath was creamy. The bitter taste of balsamic vinegar mixed in throughout blended well with the salty and mildly sweet tones of tomato sauce. The bartender  (who was also very cordial and attentive throughout) also brought me a free bread basket with what I suppose was Bravo's special dipping oil - it looked like tomato olive oil. The bread was warm and so soft on the inside, while slightly crispy on the outside.  I will definitely be visiting more often from now on!",

The hostesses were casual, but attentive and we were seated at a comfortable booth... The menu looked great and diverse, with lots of yummy sounding Italian appetizers & dinners. Our waiter was busy & we felt very rushed throughout the entire dinner. Having been a waiter... I can tell you this guy needed a lot more training. He didn't welcome us to the restaurant, didn't give his name, didn't ask us how we were, didn't tell us what the specials were etc. No he he took our drink order and disappeared. When he returned we gave him our dinner orders, but he never asked whether we wanted an appetizer, salad, soup & literally left the table so quickly we couldn't tell him. When he came back with our drinks, we asked to place an appetizer order. He returned with my salad but forgot my clients soup... What a dope! I had no sooner put the dressing on my salad, and the entrees were at our table? Terrible timing! To add insult to injury, my entree was some of the lowest quality Italian food that I've eaten (they couldn't even get the temperature right - my chicken was cold). My client had to ask another waiter to bring her a salad, because our waiter didn't come back to check on us. When the waiter finally did return to the table he was in a rush to clear it & I was appalled how he reached over us to clear the plates. I left the waiter a 10% tip which was way more than he deserved. Once he picked up the check he never came back...terrible service! As we left the restaurant the hostesses said See ya? Really? Not I hope you have a pleasant evening. Had I not been with clients I would've 100% demanded a different waiter and to see the manager.",

Not only do they have 5 dollar drink specials but they have 4 dollar happy hour plates which are DELICIOUS and quite large for portion size.  My favorites were the fried shrimp with a really great sauce with green onions on top, Diablo shrimp, which was a really tasty dipping dish with shrimp  in the sauce and fried eggplant as a dipper, and the chicken bacon and shrimp flatbread.  A great date idea that lets you try a lot of different foods and enjoy good company.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was absolutely wonderful.  He answered all my questions easily and had fun at his job.  Place is pretty crowded so   scope out the bar to get a seat.  ENJOY!",

I ordered the chicken woozie, essentially fettuccine chicken Alfredo with spinach.. the chicken was cooked well, Alfredo was tasty, but the spinach just seemed like an afterthought.

After a few minutes I noticed that there were at least 6 to 8 empty tables. In the next 15 minutes I watched 6 to 8 parties come in and she told them all the same thing, 25 to 30 minute wait time. About half the groups left and the rest took pagers and waited with us in a tiny lobby with only 3 chairs. I see more people leave and more clear tables and still we all wait. I finally asked why are we all waiting with so many empty tables. She told me that they were giving their wait staff a break since they were very busy.  I asked, You would rather turn customers away at the door and piss off more by having them stand around in a crowded lobby all while looking at empty tables, So your employees can have a bit of a break? She said you will have to ask the manager. Ok bring him over. Same response from him. We are just giving out wait staff a little break. I asked couldn't you just seat the customers and explain that you are busy. He said I didn't want them to get seated and then ignored. So you would rather let them leave or feel like they are being ignored in the lobby staring at empty tables. That's just bad management! Seat them, give them water and a menu and work harder. Sending customers and money out the door is never the right answer! We ate next door!",

I ordered a dirty martini and it was probably the best that's ever been made. The olives were \"real\" olives... Not polluted with salt. I ordered my drink \"extra dirty\" and it was made just that. $5 was not bad for happy hour. I have to give a shout out to the bartender, who was absolutely on her A-game and sweet as pie. A 5 star experience for sure.  Once my husband came, we were seated at a table. At first though, we were told we had to wait about 20 minutes, so I grabbed another drink. Then suddenly they seated us.. I was a little confused about what was going on and felt bad for the bartender who was unsure whether we were staying or going.   We ordered a calamari appetizer and we got it steamed, not fried. I love that they were able to steam it for us. And the sauce that went with it was outrageously tasty. The marinara was good too. I wasn't a fan of the bread, though. That dipping oil didn't really do it for me. Our dishes came out in a timely manner and were literally steaming hot. I asked for extra garlic in mine and boy, they did not disappoint! Not to compare, but when I go to Olive Garden and request extra garlic in my dishes, they look at me like I have 3 heads.   The booth we were seated in was super spacious and comfortable, as well. Our server was kind and attentive. Although we didn't save room for dessert, I wish we would have because I would have loved to try one of their options. If nothing else, it is definitely worth it to come back for happy hour. I also enjoyed how there were plenty of healthy options on the menu. My husband said he walked by a salad that was enormous and looked delicious.   I noticed the managers walking around, meeting the tables and doing their best to patrol the dining room. I love waking into a place and just sensing that the reason everything runs so smoothly is because of the teamwork and leadership. We originally came here because we had a gift card, but I know we will be back soon, for the reasons listed above.",

The food is not out of this world, omg delicious, but it certainly is not bad. Had the mozerella fried ravioli and the lobster ravioli...clearly coz I love the ravioli. The appetizer was nothing real great, just about what you would think, no distinct reason to order it the next time. The lobster ravioli was good, the sauce it came in was delicate. But again nothing to write home about.  There was certainly nothing bad about the place, but nothing super awesome either apart from the decor",

We came back the second time and asked for her by name, she was such a good waitress.  The food is phenomenal.   First time visiting we had the stuffed banana peppers (fantastic!) and the pasta woozie (also great!).  The second visit was spinach and artichoke dip (very garlicky but  very good) and chicken Parmesan (fantastic as well!).  The portion sizes range from a \"decent\" amount to \"oh wow, that's a lot!\"  The deserts were great, our large group tried almost all of them.  One person in our group has Celiacs and said that the gluten free meals and the creme Brulee were the best she's had in a long time (if ever!).  The caramel cheesecake was a huge hit (but make sure you love caramel), and the chocolate cake was very rich and delicious.  Everyone in the party was more than satisfied and we left very happy both times.  Definitely a go-back, great atmosphere for families, dates...etc, and definitely a great value for the cost!!",

Rob was also helpful to me when needed, great personable skills ! Bravo is a great place to hang when you're just getting off work and need somewhere to relax and enjoy conversation . Highly recommended!!!",

    "text": "They got my husband's order wrong but made up for it, giving him what he actually ordered and letting him keep what they gave him.  I found the food to be underwhelming and overpriced. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to the Olive Garden, but that's what it reminded me of - just more expensive and no salad (boo!) - also not as good. Pretty bland.   I guess if you're a suburbanite who wants a \"fancy night out\", and you don't like complex flavor, go for it!   The atmosphere is really nice. Underwhelmed by the staff and service. The server we had was training someone that night - awkward.   Overall, would I go back? Probably not, especially given all of the other options in the area.   Try out some other options in the area!",

She immediately brought her manager, Curtis, over to speak with us. Curtis was also helpful and considerate. He kept a watchful eye over my son's meal while being prepared and had great ideas on how to accommodate him. My son said it was the best meal he ever had!",

I think they gave our table to someone who was complaining.  Not much on the menu for someone who does not eat cow cheese.  I ordered the veal parm and my wife settled on chicken.  My wife's salad came out with cheese on it.  Waiter noticed It and went to get another.  Food was good not great.  It was hard not to notice the many people waiting to be seated and those who had reservations that were upset at the delay.  We had $50 in gift cards given to us and we still paid 40 more.  A real Italian restaurant would have given us a great meal for $90.00",

My friend suggested the restaurant for dinner and wine. I made a reservation with open table to gain more points and use my $20 gift card from open table.   It was such a good night! The restaurant was mostly empty, many dinners choice to eat outside, it was a nice warm evening for it.   We started with bread and oil. I ordered the Chicken - Bacon  Flatbread, I also ordered a Caesar Salad and Wedding Soup EXCELLENT! The soup reminded  me of the Wedding Soup we used to order at Johnny Carinos, I so miss that restaurant in Monroeville.   The Moscato Wine was very tasty ! I had Two glasses.   My girlfriend ordered, The Bravo Pasta dish, she offered a taste, it was delicious  !!   The atmosphere and service I enjoyed.   I whole heartedly recommend this restaurant and I know we will return. I will return with family as well.  UPDATE:   Second dinner - Birthday celebration bring us back  Excellent service and dinner as first time.  Highly Recommend!!",

    "text": "My friend has heard great things about Bravo's brunch on Saturdays and Sundays and asked if we should give it a shot. I was reluctant because I regularly avoid Bravo at all costs due to previous visits taking hours out of my day for an 'okay' meal, but I was getting bored with the variety at the Waterfront, which my friend and I frequent regularly for our catch-up lunches every few weeks. I gave a half-hearted yes and decided to give them another try- we decided on 11AM as soon as they opened (that's a little late for brunch, no?) and were promptly seated. We had a movie across the street at Loews at 12:35 so of course this was more than enough time to eat brunch - not! We didn't get out of there until 12:15 and not because we were sitting and chatting after the meal, but the long wait for the food! More on that later...  The brunch menu has a decent selection of breakfast foods, a couple sandwiches, a couple types of pizza, a few entree salads, and quite a few pasta options. I decided on the Romano chicken salad but asked for grilled chicken instead of the breaded/fried chicken. It was delicious with chopped lettuce, chopped eggs, small pieces of bacon, Parmesan cheese (quite odd- you'd think they'd have Parmesan shavings or shredded Parmesan, but no, it's like the finely-ground Kraft Parmesan cheese from the shaker bottle); the Parmesan dressing was excellent, though I wish they tossed the dressing with the salad instead of giving cups of the dressing as it was quite thick. My friend decided on the egg white omelette that comes with a side of fruit salad. She really enjoyed hers as well.   Back to the wait time-  I haven't dined at Bravo for years even though I live in close proximity to two locations (Galleria and Waterfront). IT IS SOOOO SLOW HERE. I just don't get it! As I mentioned, we got there at 11:00 on the dot, so there weren't many other people dining around us, and our food took 45 minutes, for an omelette and an entree salad! I think that is just crazy. To be fair,  I would expect that for hearty pasta dinners if the place is completely packed and it's dinner time, but not a mostly-empty restaurant at 11:00 in the morning! It is extremely annoying. I see that nothing has changed in the service department so I am still reluctant to go again.   Maybe we'll meet again in a few more years, Bravo. And mostly for the bread and oil :)",

Well, they must do things differently in Columbus, because the food is outstanding and reasonable priced ($10-$22 per entree).  I found the Chicken Milanase to be outstanding, even if I don't know how to spell it.  The Mixed Grill of beef and chicken was also superb, with perfectly cooked meat and an excellent sauce.  Every time I've been there, service has been classy, friendly and attentive.  All Bravo restaurants I've seen are sparkling clean and immacualte, even the restrooms.  In a sense, I hate to write a review like this.  I wish I could love the local places, supposedly run by real people with heart.  But almost all the local places I've seen have sloppy service, mediocre food and restrooms so dirty even a cockroach would be appalled.  It's downright embarassing for the best Italian place in Pittsburgh to be run by an impersonal chain out of Columbus.  But they do great work, and it deserves our appreciation - and patronage.",

The best thing I have tried here was the Chicken Scaloppini. The chicken is covered in melted cheese and has a great lemon sauce. I would highly, highly recommend this dish.  For dessert, try the apple turnover thing with ice cream. You won't be disappointed.",

HOWEVER, if you are a dessert person, (a la Cheesecake factory), you may be disappointed.  it is not about the quality; it is about the quantity;  ESPECIALLY how the ice cream (gelato) is served.  it is as if someone went to munchkin land to get the smallest scoop they could find, can't \"scoop\" because of weak wrists, and is miserly as well!  I ordered the warm cookie blondie - full size - it came with 2 average (on the smaller size) blondies with an almost invisible \"scoop\" of ice cream.  I laughed!  now, was it good? absolutely!; did i feel as if i had dessert? not really, especially when compared with other restaurants including Fish Market (luscious ice cream pie) and Cheesecake (the place to go if you really love desserts)...  for the price and the quantity, well let's say I was just disappointed. . . please, manager,  up size your desserts (especially the gelato). . . then Bravo will be the best of the best.",

Just a heads up -- make sure you sign up on their website for their email list!  Just for signing up, I got a free appetizer, which we used for a delicious shrimp platter.  It was so good that my mom's considering ordering this instead of a real entree next time.  For your birthday, you get a free entree (with a generous timespan during which you can use it).",

The pasta dishes are that new-wave Italian that can be found in chains from Macaroni Grill to Carraba's - a red sauce verging on salsa.  I'm surprised they even bother to heat it.  Maybe they should sprinkle tortilla chips on top.  I guess I have a thing for comfort food;  I like mama's sauce.  And there are a lot of options around that are almost as good as mama's, if not better (although I'd never tell her that).  And they all include a salad.  But the place did do one thing I wish local restaurants would pick up on.  Waitresses are armed with pitchers of real, honest-to-goodness, brewed, unsweet iced tea.",

    "text": "Italian food is one of my favorites, right behind Mexican and Thai.  It's not easy to find an authentic Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I've tried several Italian bistros over the past few years, some good, and some not so good.  One of the better Italian restaurants in the city is Bravo Cucina Italiana, at the Waterfront. Even though it's a chain-restaurant, Bravo is authentic from the time you walk through the large glass doors.  A strong scent of garlic grabs your attention immediately.  High ceilings and marble adorn much of the restaurant.  The oversized bar is usually crowded, especially in the evenings and during the weekend.  As we entered Bravo, a nice hostess greeted us and asked, \"How many in your party?\" \"Two.\"  It was Friday night at 7pm, and we were seated immediately.  I noticed the wait staff working in a hurried manner, and were dressed in pressed black slacks, black bow-ties, and long white aprons.  Our waiter arrived, took our drink order, and was off.  My guest and I tried to have a conversation, but it was difficult to hear each other-bad acoustics!  We were served warm bread and dipping oil which was very tasty- be careful, you can easily fill up on this! I love Caesar salads, so I ordered one.  My dinner mate chose the house salad.  The romaine was crisp; the dressing was tart, with enough anchovies (I usually order extra).  The dinner salad was comprised of greens, cucumbers, and parmesan dressing-very good. For our entrees, I chose the Pepperoni Pizza ($9.99), and my dinner companion selected the Grilled Salmon served with green beans, potatoes, lemon-caper butter sauce and a parmesan crust ($19.99).  My pizza was excellent- the cheese had a smoky flavor, and the sauce was sweet, with a small kick of heat.  The crust was chewy and sweet- the cornmeal used to keep the dough from sticking to the cooking surface added extra flavor.  The salmon was tasty and not over cooked; the parmesan crust added some extra saltiness that the fish needed.  Other entrees at Bravo include: Chicken Parmesan ($15.49), Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli ($18.99), Chicken Scaloppine ($15.49), Grilled Scallops with Gnocchi ($18.79), Sauteed Crab Cakes ($19.99), and Filet Mignon Toscano, 8 ozs. ($28.99), and a New York Strip Steak, 14 ozs. ($21.00).  *Ask you server for daily specials. If you like dessert, and are one of the few people that have never tried Tiramisu, try Bravo's.  In consists of lady fingers dipped in coffee liqueur, mascarpone cheese, and cocoa ($6.99).  Excellent! If you like Italian food, you'll be pleased with Bravo's.  The good food and consistently first class service will put a smile on your face.  Chef Chuck Kerber",

    "text": "For March Break (the perks of being a teacher), I decided to drive down to North Carolina from my humble abode in Toronto. After driving for a good five hours, I found myself in Cranberry Township for the night. The hotel where I was staying had a promotional offer - as a guest at the Holiday Inn Express, I was entitled to a 10% discount on a meal from Bravo Cucina Italiana.   As previously mentioned, this is a \"chain\" and there are five locations throughout the Pittsburgh area. The restaurant is very, very clean (including the washrooms). The staff are all professional and courteous. Pricing of the food is very reasonable. Dinner for three totaled approximately $45.   We were happy with our selection and would recommend the following:  - Eggplant Parmigiana, it comes with a fettuccine Alfredo pasta side, which is delicious  - Pepperoni and Banana Pepper Pizza, it is extremely hot!  - Pasta bolognese, it is simple, but good.   I don't see myself back any time soon; however, this is purely due to the fact that I don't live in Pittsburgh nor do I go to Pittsburgh often.",

I only ate half my pasta because I knew I had to have dessert when I saw the tray being carried around ... And I wasn't disappointed. My mom has the chopped salad, baked salmon pasta and the cheesecake - she loved her food too! Also, their bread is amazing ... Amazing!",

My friend and I decided to stop here before we went to a concert. I ordered the Eggplant Parm and it was above average. For one, it wasn't drenched in sauce and it was lightly breaded. It came with a side of linguine (my favorite) in an herb sauce. It was the perfect mix and I brought half of it home.   My friend and I decided to share their Nutella Pudding.... yes you read that right....NUTELLA pudding! I LOVE anything involving Nutella, and this was amazing.   If you're heading to the Waterfront, this is a great place to stop. On the weekends it's a bit busier and a longer wait, but just like any Italian dinner, what's the rush? Mangia!!!",

    "text": "This is a solid place to find yourself eating when you need to celebrate a special occasion.  We came here to celebrate my grandmas 89th birthday, and we left feeling satisfied and full.  Real quick, just gotta say we were not too happy with the hostesses.  We had a reservation for 5 and they did not even have the table set for us.  Also they tried squeezing the 8 of us at a 6 person table even while the restaurant was completely empty.  It didnt make any sense, but we got it sorted out eventually.  The delicious food that followed the whole debacle made me forget about the whole incident.    The appitizers we ordered were super.  The bruschetta was out of this world.  We were all in agreement that it was one of the best bruschettas we have ever had.  The calimari was also very tasty.  My mother and I also split a salad that had Gorgonzola cheese in it.  It was also delicious.  Everybody's main courses were all devoured.  My mother's lobster ravioli was delicious; of course she let her boy try it.  My dad's shrimp pasta was completely finished off.  Also, I ordered the tilapia with crab, and I found myself eating it so slowly just so I could enjoy it fully.  I was even able to order which kind of veggies I wanted on the said with it, and believe me when I say they were great.  Since we were celebrating, dessert was something that had to be ordered.  They brought my grandma a cup of gelato with a candle in it; very nice gesture.  My dad ordered the big threesome plate of desserts: tiramisu, chocolate chip cake, and chocolate melting cake.  All three of them were great, so if you are the kind of person that likes sampling different desserts, go with the threesome plate.  My mom and I ordered the apple pie dessert and the cheesecake.  Both were good, but nothing too out of the ordinary with the apple pie.  The cheesecake, however, did have a sugaring glazed cooked onto the one side of it.  That was a very nice and tasty touch.    Like I said, this place is a little more upscale of a restaurant.  If you are going on a first date or celebrating some event, you gotta check this place out.",

    "text": "Decent Italian chain. We got the salmon salad, lobster ravioli alla vodka, and the lobster bisque appetizer. Nothing really stood out. But, nothing was bad, either. Lobster bisque had little lobster in it. The bread and olive oil was OK.   The interior of the restaurant was decent. High ceilings and a lot of seats.   We went in at 9pm and were out by 10:10pm to catch our 10pm movie. The service was slow at the end (we waited for our credit cards to be taken for 10 minutes), although we had notified our waitress early on.   Tastes like a chain, looks like a chain, acts like a chain, so it must be a chain. We were not disappointed, but were not thrilled either.",

Just a little more upscale than average without the crazy price. Service is pretty good, kind of depends on the waiter/waitress you get. Food is decent/average. Filet mignon is delicious. Must try their dessert. They bring you a platter of all the deserts they have for you to choose which one you'd like. Definitely worth a try to go to!",

However, we have been finding a distinct drop in quality over our recent visits with our visit today as the worst.  In particular, we experienced the following during our dinner at Bravo (at the Homestead in Pittsburgh) tonight: Service was very slow overall despite the place not being especially busy with no wait for seating; complimentary bread took 20 minutes to arrive, and then the food arrived 60 seconds later;  the waiter forgot to bring side dishes; we requested extra marinara sauce for the eggplant parmigiana, they brought about a thimbfull's worth;   They charged $3 for about three medium sliced, sauteed mushrooms; coffee was served lukewarm and had to be replaced.  So, all-in-all, it was a disappointing dinner for the family.   Time to find a new restaurant for family outings....",

    "text": "I ate at Bravo last Friday night before going over to the improv for a late night show. My husband and I arrived at 7:30 pm and were told that it would be about 10 minutes for a table. Within 10 minutes we were seated and greeted by our server. Not bad at all for a busy Friday night. This was by no means our first trip to Bravo, but we had not been there for over a year.   The service was excellent. Our waiter casually chatted with us about my pregnancy and his children while we waited for our dinner guests who were 15 minutes late. I ordered the chopped salad with italian vinagarette and the shrimp fra diavalo (sp?) for my entree. Our salads came out rather fast but there did seem to be a delay in our entrees. We happily muched on the delicious bread and dip (my favorite thing about Bravo!) while we waited. When our entrees did arrive, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of shrimp in my dish. Typically, a pasta dish will have about 4-8 good sized shrimp. My Shrimp fra Diavalo had upwards or 10 shrimp! The pasta was cooked well but, I was rather disappointed in the sauce. Based on the name of the dish, I was expecting a little spice. Unfortunately, the sauce was rather bland and tasted like a generic tomato cream sauce. For dessert, I ordered the small chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The contrast between the warm cake and the cold ice cream was delectable. The portion size was also perfect for one. All in all, a good place to eat while at the waterfront.",
