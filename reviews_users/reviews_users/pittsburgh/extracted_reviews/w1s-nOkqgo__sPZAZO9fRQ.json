    "text": "I really enjoy this place!  We have been there several times for a date night when we had a Groupon, and we have also gone there a few times with friends and family for late night food and drinks. The atmosphere is pretty cool, with high top tables and bench seats and plenty of televisions for your sports viewing pleasure. The food is upscale bar food. The wings are very good, crispy and the dry rubs are tasty.  I have had a few of their sandwiches and burgers.  Each was good, but not spectacularly memorable. The bacon blue burger was good! The prices are higher than I would expect for the food items.  The service has always been pretty good. Overall it has been a pleasant local spot to go for late night food with good company, and we keep going back!",

    "text": "Used a groupon here. Our server was nice and friendly. The place was clean and corporate looking for a sports bar. There were bench seats around bistro style tables in the center but we chose to sit at a small table for two against a wall. We arrived shortly after they opened at 4 PM and 3 other couples came in during our meal so Level 20 was not very busy. We both ordered Colin's Fish and Chips... Our food arrived quick and hot... Large and thick pieces of cod with a crisp dark brown crust and tasty fries... Everything was good and our server was attentive but not overbearing. The reason for the three stars is because of the prices. Even with our groupon which saved us 10.00 our bill seemed high for 2 orders of fish and chips and 1 yuengling.  32.17 before the discount...  In a Burgh full of places that serve excellent fried fish I feel that there are better options for the price.",

    "text": "Not your typical sports bar. Hubs and I headed over for a quick meal on a recent Friday night. The inside has a walled off bar area and a restaurant area with small tables and larger tables with leather benches in the shape of a triangle for more than 2 people. Several t.v.s in all directions. The menu really threw us for a loop, in a good way. There were several gourmet sandwiches and entrees. I was tempted by the roasted (in house!) Turkey sandwich with cranberry mayo but ultimately, I went with the grilled chicken dinner with a bourbon glaze over orzo pasta with veggies (green beans and wax beans-fresh). I also started with a salad and went with the suggested home made tomato/basil vinagerette. Everything was incredible. Not at all what I would expect from a neighborhood sports bar. I think this would be a great place to catch a game and actually have food you enjoy.",

As with other restaurants, we have found a couple menu items that we really like, so we keep ordering them and don't explore the full menu.  It's not a large menu.  It's a sports bar but we have always gone early enough to avoid the karaoke and athletic events.  I always order Colin's Fish & Chips.  Large portion of fish with good crisp breading and the fries have typically been hot when served.  Definitely the best \"fish and chips\" in the area. My wife requires gluten free and they don't have a GF menu.  They have always been able to accommodate her.  She usually orders salmon and has always enjoyed it. Some have indicated that their prices are on the high side.  Probably not out of line with popular chain restaurants and we have usually had a \"groupon\" type coupon.  They also have a \"loyalty\" card that offers a free entree with five visits.",

    "text": "A group of us decided to try this place out after getting a livingsocial deal. I won't be back. We were told that the special was $7 dollar burgers, and with only 3 burgers on the menu we thought it was any burger. The man that may have been the owner/manager didn't specify otherwise when he told us the specials. Our fault for not clarifying.  My boyfriend ended up with a mediocre 12 dollar burger. The fries were good, but he thought the meat had a strange consistency.  I got the boneless wings. The whiskey sauce may have been good, but all I could taste was how over fried and burnt the wings were. I didn't even finish them. Our friend got the buffalo wings, which he did like. However after he went through 2 little cups of ranch, I overheard the manager (I think this guy was the manager/owber) ask our server how many cups she had already given our friend. i then saw the guy add something on the order computer. We were charged 50 cents for the ranch without being told we would be. We also got a order of the Chef's fries for the table. Definitely not worth the 9 dollar price tag. The order was small, served on big plate, but not the high pile of fries you would expect for 9 bucks. There was nothing special about them either. The one and only highpoint for me was Sam Adam's Cherry Wheat on draft. Otherwise the experience was forgettable.",

The food is easily the best I've ever had in a sports bar, and they can pour a proper pint of Guinness, too.  The housemade potato chips are ideal for sharing as a table starter: fresh, abundant and substantial.  The boneless wings, caprese flatbread and fish & chips were all well above average and attractively presented, but the wild mushroom ravioli is absolutely top-notch -- it's the best value on the menu and would be right at home in any of the best restaurants in the city.  A seasonal grilled-shrimp and salad special that we tried over the summer was also a pleasant surprise.  I've heard great things about the steak and look forward to trying it next time.  Don't let the nondescript exterior fool you: this place is definitely worth a visit!",

Having never been there before, we thought we would venture to the upstairs to check it out. We were unaware that there was a comedy show that night, and the place was kind of dead. There were maybe two other groups in the room. The comedy show was pretty good until one comedian used the terms \"F'ing retard\" in the bit. At that point, my entire group was lost. As an educator of children with special needs, as well as a step parent to a child with Autism, I found this extremely offensive. My husband is a special education teacher, and works part time with adults who are disabled. I was shocked that such language would be in a routine in this day in age. I will never return for any type of entertainment at this establishment, if this is the norm.",

This place has one long bar against the side of the building with maybe 15 or so seats, some high tables in the room with the bar, a separate room with some tables, and then an upstairs area that I think is reserved for private parties. There was nothing special that attracted me about the setting or ambience, other than the fact that the bar was crowded and loud.   Seating was tight at the bar, but I was lucky to find one open spot. I sat down and waited to place a beer order while I watched some other patrons who came in after me get their orders taken. It took a while to have my existence acknowledged.   It looked like they had a few good craft beers but I settled for a Yuengling, which had a special price of $4 that night. In some bars, $4 is just about the regular price of Yuengling. I was served the beer in a plastic cup.   A Penguins game came on so they switched all three screens behind the bar to that game instead of the World Series Pre-game that they had on previously. There were no viewing choices if you sat at the bar--it was hockey or bust. They did keep the baseball game in another screen behind the bar, but I would have to turn around to watch it.   I ordered a Chicken Asiago sandwich, which was normally $11.95 but was $2 off on Saturdays. The sandwich was not too appetizing to me. It came on a generic hamburger bun and the chicken meat did not seem too good quality. It was smothered with the cheese. The sandwich came with a bunch of fries, and I didn't seen any options for sides, not even chips. I don't really think this sandwich is worth spending $11.95.   I might give this place another shot if it was closer, but don't think it's worth going out of the way for it.",

I honestly was skeptical at first to go to Level 20, but some friends suggested we go there for karaoke, and it was a blast!!!! The host was really nice and we all had such a good time. There was a good atmosphere. The drinks are reasonably priced too, I was expecting them to be more expensive from what I'd heard. Since then, we've been back for music trivia. It was fun, but I'm told that there was a substitute host that night, and tbh she was a little rude. Again, she's not the normal person so she could have just been stressed out or having a bad day. We still had fun though!   Overall- We'll definitely be back! Probably not going to try the food though based on other people's experience.",

Our waitress was the only one on the floor and had a party of at least 20 that clearly took priority. I don't blame her though, I blame the owners. Even when our drinks were ordered it took about 30 minutes to get them. When I finally got my drink it was so bad I couldn't even drink it. I stuck with water for the rest of the night and even that took a lot of time to get.   The karaoke DJ was okay. But no one there is really into it anymore. A little boy from the party of 20 kind of took over and made the whole night about him. I personally think kids need to be out of there by 11.   Needless to say they lost my business. The prices of food there is insanely high and I'm not going to pay all that money for sub par service.",

Wife was pleased with her burger, perfectly sized.  Daughter's grilled chicken salad was GONE!  Service was good.  The beer was cold!  Personally, I think the interior looks unfinished; a bit harsh.  They've been there for years, yet it still looks like they just opened; that they're waiting for some finishing touches to come in.",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in quite some time. We stopped in for a bite to eat and a drink at the bar. The bartender was inattentive and seemed a bit slow. The bartender provided almost nonexistent service and at one point a fellow customer got up and walked out because he was not being waited on. There were six people at the bar at the time. The food was mediocre at best and overpriced. Save yourself the time and aggravation and go somewhere else. I'm sure you can find better service and better food almost anywhere else.",

    "text": "I've been to Level 20 twice now. The first time was for their Saturday karaoke and the second time for a Paint Nite event. It's a fairly pricey place. One entree and one drink each for me and my wife cost over $40 before the tip and their draft beers (served in a regular drinking glass, not a large one) are easily in the $6-7 range, although there's no indication I could find of prices until they hand you the beer and request the money. The food was good, no complaints there. I had the Irish Burger, which they cooked rare according to my tastes, and my wife had the Ravioli. Karaoke was pretty decent. Two wireless mikes and two different TVs displaying lyrics, pretty typical. The rotation went quickly, and seemed pretty fair. A few people were slotted in at the beginning as regulars, but it wasn't that many. The song books are a bit out of date, and still refer to CDG numbers despite the KJ obviously using an electronic storage system.  The major caveats I have about the place are a) the expense and b) a relative lack of seating room during karaoke (although that might have been influenced by there also being a Pens game going on). But overall, it's quite adequate.  Funny story, I asked about the name of the place from one of the bartenders. Apparently the owner wanted to name the place \"Level 2\" since they have upper and lower floors. After he ordered a sign and merchandise, he found out there was already a bar by that name in the area. Rather than completely redo all of the designs, he added a \"0\" to the name.",

    "text": "Me and a group of friends went for their Saturday Karaoke Night. In terms of bartenders, the girl who was working (didn't catch her name) was doing a bulk of the work and did a great job. She was friendly and got me my drinks in a reasonable amount of time.  The other bartender was a heavy set guy who stared at me while I waited to order a couple of times and just walked away.  That was the least of his problems.    Towards the end of the night I was holding a conversation with my friends when the male bartender yelled out \"See you later Faggot\", or something to that extent.  The bar was loud to begin with, but he screamed loud enough for me to hear over all of the noise.  I confronted him about it, keeping calm to the extent of warning him about using such offensive language.  He refused to apologize and actually had the nerve to defend his use of the word.  Unfortunately I had already tipped (20% at that since the girl bartender was so nice), but I can confidently say that I will not be going back to this bar due to this rude bartender and his reluctance to apologize for using a homophobic slur.",

From the outside it didn't look like much but inside was a bit cooler. If you don't like sports bar decor, don't go. We were there to eat, have a few beers, and get some work done. We sat where we could plug in our laptops, had a few beers, too. I had chicken & she had a salad. We split the nachos which were really good & only happy hour half off. Everything was good except when the waitress kept coming to check on us every five minutes. We had our food done, we had half full beers, we were talking, and there were maybe two other tables with customers. It's not like people were waiting for the table.",

    "text": "My husband and I are new to the area and thought we would try this place out.   We bought a Groupon to use since it was offered.   I'm very disappointed with the quality of the food.     The atmosphere is definitely a sports bar which was great to watch the Pirates game.  The tables were a bit awkward since I'm pregnant.   It was hard to stay comfortable on the stool.   But the whole place seemed kinda sterile.  The food was nothing to write home about.  We had wings, a chix wrap,  and pulled pork nachos. Other than things being rediculously over pricedthe food was mediocre.   The wings were not fully cooked to a nice wing crispy skin texture.   My wrap had 1 chicken finger in it that was cut up and full of lettuce.  The meat to other ingredients ratio were completely off.   The nachos were the best part but you could tell the meat was prepackaged in a store bought sauce.  The other ingredients on the nachos was either canned liquid cheese or some thing that was so florescent in color it couldn't be fresh.     The service was ok.   Our server cared at first but then once we had our food she never stopped back.  We had to flag her down for refills and then she took my cup that was partially full while.    My husband and I are self proclaimed beer snobs and enjoy good beer.  Even having the label of church brewworks on the menu won't get us to come back.",

I didn't ask about the family and frankly don't care. You've offered excuses and never even apologized once. Why don't you unblock me from your FB page so I can put my review back up there too?

I had the mushroom ravioli, which was great, and my fiance had the turkey sandwich, which I had some bites of...and let me tell you, it was incredible. It tasted like Thanksgiving in a sandwich. I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't much busier than it was.  The service was great. The only complaint I might have is that some of the prices are a little higher than you'd expect for some things, but it's not that big of a deal for how good the food was.",
