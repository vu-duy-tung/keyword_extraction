The fried rice was dry and fairly flavorless. I got the crispy spicy tuna roll, which was made perfectly crispy and turned out to be the highlight of the meal. The general tsos and the sesame chicken tasted like the sauce was ketchup based and they were exactly the same, excepting he sesame seeds.   If it were not for the groupon I would have gone a star lower. Even if given the chance though, I will not be going back.",

That may have been our first clue. The sushi chef did, though, and dunking our sushi into ponzu made it better.   The fish could have been a bit fresher, the seaweed a bit less tough, and the rice a little more fluffy and sticky.   The edamame, however, was top-notch. Service was pretty attentive. I'd go back to try the hibachi, but the sushi didn't do it for me. The search will continue!",

The first bad experience I had was when I ordered chicken pad Thai at a spice level 10, and there was literally NO spice in it.  I'd been ordering takeout for a long time from there, so I assumed it was just an off night.  The second bad experience was very similar; there was no spice in the pad Thai, but also, the delivery was 15 minutes later than quoted.  My last order from there was also terrible.  Again, spiceless and cold.  Also, two of the items I ordered weren't delivered, so the driver had to return...with more cold food.  I don't recommend this restaurant any longer, and I definitely won't be back.",

Regarding the hibachi we went here for my sons birthday and he loved it. The chef along with the wait staff were very attentive which led to him having a great experience and we will definitely be returning as anytime we ask him where he wants to go to eat he says hibachi.",

The soba noodles got it the worst followed by my filet mignon--which if you prepare correctly, neither needs much salt at all. Sushi was pretty decent. Our hibachi chef was great, animated.

Before our rolls were served, the chef offered us a small, complementary plate of tasty treats: four little rolls of peppered, seared tuna wrapped around a little tuft of seaweed. Delicious!  Rolls were nicely sized and priced. We've been back, and had similarly tasty Udon soup as well. Still haven't tried hibachi though...",

I wanted hibachi and talked my friend into it and he was very happy that we did. The chef was great, presentation, his tricks, he shot probably 3 shots of sake into my mouth from a squirt bottle too...delicious. The food was amazing. We both had chicken hibachi with fried rice and a couple pieces of shrimp. For a drink, I had lemonade it was really good.  Highly suggest it.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for all you can eat sushi on Thursday. There were about 4 or 5 tables in the entire restaurant, most of which were doing the all you can eat option. The waitress prefaced our experience with the fact there were only two sushi chefs so there was definitely going to be a wait. We sat down at 7:40 and ordered by 7:55. We received miso soup promptly. We did not get any other food until at least 8:45. Then we waited for the remaining parts of our order which the waitress eventually admitted had been given to another table by mistake. Keep in mind, we only had soup, an order of crab Rangoon, a single roll and two pieces of eel sashimi by 9:15. We asked if we could just pay and leave, we didn't want the rest of the order. The waitress said she felt bad and didn't want us to pay so she had to talk to a manager, which we did not want to pay $50 for less than $50 worth of food. She came back over with the bill and explained that they would let us take the food to go because they were already working on the remaining roll and three pieces of sashimi.. the bill was the full price. We paid and left and will not be back. They cannot support their all you can eat sushi crowd (all of 5 tables) and apparently do not care. The worst dining experience I've ever had. The only reason I give it a  star is because the sushi quality wasn't bad and the waitress seemed sincere.",

The one roll we DID get tasted like plastic wrap and some tuna that was on top was cut terribly, there was still tendon or cartilage or whatever on it. When we got the bill, we were only charged for one \"all you can eat\". Keeping in mind that we didn't get 2 of our rolls and couldn't bring ourselves to eat the one we did get, we paid, tipped VERY well and went to leave. An employee came outside about the bill being wrong. When we went back in, I explained that we didn't get our whole order and that the roll we did get was bad, we didn't even eat it, they 100% did NOT care, Didn't ask what was wrong with it or ANYTHING.

I will say you can get better a bit cheaper elsewhere, but its still way better than that over priced garbage in the south side...you know the one I mean.   The staff is friendly and attentive and the ingredients always taste fresh. They even deliver! Sushi to the door, why, yes, please!  To the reviewer who wrote about them \"banging the utensils on the grill\" during the hibachi meal, and also mentioned that she usually chatted with guests during the cooking or \"sometimes read a book.\" Are you kidding me? All the chefs (in ANY hibachi restaurant) have different personalities, and yes, their jokes aren't always hilarious, but when you go to hibachi dinner, you go for a show. I have eaten hibachi all over the country and have never NOT seen them bang the utensils on the grill. And read a book?! Part of going to this type of dinner is to see the the chef in action. They train for months to be able to do those things. If I were the chef I would be incredibly insulted if you weren't paying attention. To me, this is a ludicrous reason to give a negative review.   FYI you can sit at a normal table and still order from the hibachi menu. Save the good seats for those of us that want to participate in the fun.",

It was so dominant I could smell it through the box and bag in the car. It was not the typical lo mein taste with the dominance of the garlic, which some people may enjoy, but I personally wouldn't get the lo mein again. The miso soup was good. It had a good bit of seaweed, but did not have much tofu, as most miso soups skimp on. It was nothing wonderful, mediocre at best. The general tsos was better than anything else I ordered. The all white chicken pieces were mostly bite size, and the sauce was good. We ordered it to be not spicy, as spicy is indicated beside it on the menu. The prices are relatively inexpensive for Chinese food, which makes Katana an appealing place to order Chinese food at! I would try Katana again and dine in to experience the in restaurant experience, but I would never order take out again.",

    "text": "Katana has added a touch of cyberpunk sleekness to West Liberty Avenue with its bold Asian cuisine, flaming teppanyaki tables, dangerously stylized neon sign, and overall modish atmosphere. Images of a motorcycle rumbling and a blade scraping against a rain-slicked black street were conjured as we drove up to Katana late last week. Fortunately, the food, which includes Japanese, Chinese, and Thai fare, matched up to the visuals, for me at least.   We opted for privacy and eschewed the hibachi spectacle for a quiet meal in the cool, calm back dining room. Beginning our meal was an appetizer of steamed dumplings that were soft as butter, meaty as a Porterhouse steak, and as moist as mid-morning summer grass.   Unsure as to what I wanted, I went with dual starters for dinner: Godzilla rolls and Tuna Tartare.   A quintet of deep-fried medallions enrobed in seaweed and filled with rice, whitefish, crabmeat, roe, and eel were plated before me and drizzled with some sort of orange sauce that recalled mayonnaise. To think that I had gotten bored with sushi. The batter provided for a crisp hide that steamed each roll's innards to delicate, delectable effect. The velvet, fluorescent dressing captured the eye and enhanced their vaguely sugary richness. It was county fair food by way of the Far East, and I could have destroyed another plate or two of it as easily as a giant, irradiated reptile would Tokyo. Roar, baby, roar, and unleash that atomic breath!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dln8-Y-fIbqM&s=c1a716f608fc8288d81fef7344e3d7d6eb830344c136a147d7eb12ee0541020e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=ln8-...</a>  The Tuna Tartare was closer to elegantly cut and presented sashimi, but complain I will not for the fish was fresh, chilly, raw, oceanic ecstasy. No ginger or wasabi was necessary.   Kay's fatty, paper-brittle Crispy Duck made me salivate, caused my stomach juices to roil, and turned my brown eyes green. I was grateful that she allowed be to finish so that I could testify to its simplistic, rotisserie-ish quality. Meat peeled from the bones, the skin became a snack in itself, and the thick, chocolatey oyster sauce became inapplicable as the duck was just too rich, toothsome, and well-prepared to be coated in condiments.  Kay had a fried banana while I went with a globe of fried ice cream that rivaled the Mexican version with a cakey, floury, nutty crust that enveloped the vanilla ice cream adequately.  With foxily displayed A-1 food, solid service, and an atmosphere that flickers with fires of a culinary origin, Katana's prospects in the South Hills look promising. Let's hope they continue to get the commerce they deserve.",

    "text": "I have been here 4 times and I have enjoyed every visit. I discovered Katana through Groupon. I was unable to use the groupon until the 4th visit because of the other specials and coupons that they offer.   The First visit I had the All you can eat Sushi 23.95. (This eliminated the use of the groupon on this visit because it is a special and no one in your party can order a special and combine it with a groupon.) I ordered lot's of rolls, Dragon, dynamite, Alaska, California, Spider, Spicy plus lots of Eel, hamachi and others I don't remember. Although you have to be careful because there is a surcharge for any sushi/sashimi that you order but do not eat. Not a problem for me. The All you can eat sushi comes with soup or salad and an appetizer. I had the house salad (good) and a spring roll that was more like an egg roll (deep fried).  The sushi is not as good as the sushi in the Pacific Northwest but I found it very good for the Burgh.  The Second visit was an early dinner and we were able to use a 15.00 off coupon for a birthday that you can get from the Katana website. I had the Dragon & Phoenix (Generals TSO's chicken and shrimp sauteed in chili sauce) Beverly had the Green Jade broccoli, snow peas and string bean (her new favorite). Good portions and very good.  Our third visit  was a lunch visit. Beverly had the Green Jade again, I had Sweet and sour chicken which was Ok not the best I have had but OK. Our third member had a shrimp ginger salad.   Our Fourth visit was for dinner. I had the Mongolian beef, Beverly the Green Jade and our third member had the beef broccoli. All good and we were able to use the groupon.  Also ordered a pint of  Hot n Sour soup to go as it is very good.   We have had good service on every one of our visits. Friendly staff, greeted promptly, thanked on our way out and always attentive.   I am puzzled as to why Katana is not busier. Each time we have gone there have only been a few others in the restaurant.   I think Katan's is a good value and worth a try.",

I even asked her if there were mushrooms in their veggie rolls - she had no ideathat is probably why they have three orders sitting on the counter nobody pick them up for the past hour-I even overheard her arguing with a guest on the phone about having to deliver an order after it sat here for the whole time I was here... wish I could've called them and told them that their food is been sitting there for an hour but they'll find out unfortunately.

I've only ever gotten take out from Katana via GrubHub (thank you GrubHub, for existing, now please expand to non-cities like Princeton or whatever more residential areas we need food too) and everything has been deLICIOUS.    Absolutely scrumptious.  I've gotten shrimp habachi and for like $18 you get salad, noodles, veggies, shrimp, and an eggroll!  This is a perfect deal.    WHAT do they put into that ginger dressing that goes on the iceberg salad?!?!?!  I've always wondered this at hibachi places that have salad bars because the dressing is always amaaaaazing.    I've also gotten sushi from here that was fresh tasting and generous.    I never expect food to arrive in less than 40-45 minutes, which seems to be the reason for all the 1 star reviews on here BUT GrubHub kind of takes care of that for you by updating you with actual time quotes of when the food is going to get there.  In any case I have definitely never waited more than an hour for food from Katana.    It's worth it for the scrumdiddilydumptious food anyways!  I'm a fan!",

The woman who answered the phone told me that it was still in the kitchen cooking.  One order of hibachi chicken was still cooking 1.5hrs later.  But she said that my order would be ready in 10-15min.  This is my guess, they never started making my order.  After I called they did. I've been there for dinner and if you've ever been to a hibachi restaurant you know that they cook it right in front of you in about 10-15min.  They cook dinner for 8 in 10-15min.  I ordered around 7pm and got my dinner around 9.  I will never order online from there again.  And I probably won't go there for dinner either based on the fact that they told me my order was still cooking and I know that was a lie.  Katana gets 1 star simply because there is a hibachi chef there that is hilarious.  That star is for him.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to write a review until I'd eaten here a few times. After eating both in the restaurant and ordering online, I can confidently say that this place has the worst service in Pittsburgh. First, if you order online: expect to wait more than 90 minutes. No matter what day of the week, you will wait an unacceptable length of time. And if you call, you will be greeted by a rude, inconsiderate hostess who tells you \"you haven't been waiting that long,\" even though the app sent you a confirmation email 90 minutes prior. My delivery service tonight topped it off- after waiting TWO HOURS for the food I ordered, I called and was told that my driver had already been there, tried to call me, and left. First, I was here the whole time- there is no way I missed the delivery. Second, they absolutely did not try to call, as I had no missed calls on my phone. What most likely happened is that I ordered online and they didn't see my order or forgot about it, then told me I was lying to try to hide their mistake. The service, attitude of the staff, and delivery quality is miserable. Blaming their customers for their inadequacy is a terrible business model.  As for eating in the restaurant, they do not have well-trainer servers who know the menu. Each time I ate there, there was a new employee who told me she'd \"just started.\" It seems as though they cannot keep a reliable staff of servers, for whatever reason. You'll wait a long time and receive, at best, sub par service. Not recommended.  If you order from here, order at your own risk.",

    "text": "So....You want the best sushi in Pittsburgh, at the best price, in a nice and convenient location yet tucked away from the business of city and also want an option of an endless amount of sushi for an amount similar to what most people have available in their sofa at home? Cool; Stop reading through reviews and go to Katana.  Their hot menu items are delicious and the intimate charm and quietness (This is a good thing.) of this restaurant make for a delightful pairing.   I am partial to the Dormont / Green Tree / Mt. Lebanon area so I am a LITTLE biased. Nothing beats a cold Winter night in Pittsburgh better than tucking away in a charming, warm and relaxing atmosphere like Katana.  The General Tsos Shrimp is delicious (out of this world, really). The portion(s) of the hot menu items could be a bit bigger for me but I eat a LOT in terms of quantity so their regular portion(s) should be just about perfect for any one else. when in doubt - Order two!!",

Regardless, with or without a discount, Katana is a safe bet for a solid meal!  I haven't tried any of their sushi, but I've heard that it's decent. My favorite, as is my go-to choice at any Asian-inspired or Chinese restaurant, is orange chicken. They do a great job with the dish. This is also a good place to get your scallion pancake fix if you crave those things like I do! My wife always gets the chicken and broccoli, which is really good.  We've never had a bad meal and the service has always been really good. My only complaint is that the restaurant never has enough people inside. This place deserves more customers than we usually see. I hope they do well, because the food and the service deserve it!",

My wife recently placed a simple $50 order that was confirmed on grub hub but after waiting an hour (30 min past est delivery time) she called to inquire about the order and was met by a hostile employee who called her a liar and refused to deliver our food. The employee stated that the order was not placed (FALSE - grub hub receipt to prove) and that they refused to accept blame for the mistake.  The employee hung up the phone while my wife was trying to settle the problem. Grub hub called and apologized for the problem, fully refunding the purchase. Once again, I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone that values customer appreciation and quality service!",

Their rolls are all delicious and a nice size. Not too small, but not so big that you can't eat a piece in one bite. I'm a huge fan of their spicy crunchy tuna and the specialty rolls like the volcano roll. They have a great \"all you can eat\" price where you can order as many appetizers and rolls that you want for around $20...order an app and two specialty rolls and you're getting more than you're money's worth. The only catch is that they reserve the right to charge you per piece on the sushi you don't eat, so don't order too much! You can always order a second round of rolls if you're not full.   My husband is also a HUGE fan of their pork dumplings and I can't resist getting an order of crab rangoons each time we visit.  A++ in my book!",

    "text": "Ever since it opened, Katana and I have had a very...interesting relationship. Over the past year my opinion of the place has often gone back and forth between \"they're ok\" and \"ugh, never again\". At this point, though, I think I can honestly say after multiple visits and take-out orders that while I enjoy the food here well enough, I just don't love actually eating at Katana itself.  Here are my pros when it comes to Katana -   *During one meal here with my family, our hibachi grill chef provided us with a fantastic meal overall, and the cook even accommodated a special request that they said they'd never been asked about before. I give credit where credit is due - this was a huge plus.  *Certain sushi selections here are certainly a little less pricey than some other places, so depending on what you order you do get more food for what you're paying then you would elsewhere.  *Many of the rolls I've eaten here have indeed been very tasty and enjoyable, especially their eel ones.  *When I've ordered take-out I've never had a major problem with my food, and the delivery has often been 20 to 30 minutes ahead of the estimated time. They're fast, that's for sure!  However, I must also admit I've also run into many downsides during my experiences with Katana. My in-house dining experiences in particular have been less than stellar:  -During one visit, my dinner companion commented that his red bean ice cream tasted like vanilla ice cream, and that he was not impressed by the crab rangoon (note that I personally thought they were okay - not great, but okay). This same night, our waiter forgot to bring us our appetizers (another one did this for them) and also forgot to subtract our Groupon amount from our check; we were fortunate enough that a manager came by to correct this, because otherwise we would have demanded a new receipt with the correction made before even handing the waiter our credit card.   -During a different visit, our hibachi chef spent the whole of the meal trying to make my dinner party laugh at horrible jokes that I don't think anyone over a certain age would find particularly entertaining, forcing us to listen to him rather than letting us engage in other conversation. At one point he also began banging his cooking utensils on the grill far more harshly than normal. I still don't know what he was trying to do. Impress us? Scare us? Either way, it was uncalled for; I left the restaurant with a huge headache and sour attitude after that experience.  -In addition to these issues with servers and comments from friends about the food, I've also had a few issues with my orders. Once an order of dumplings had both some cold and some hot dumplings mixed into the plate, as they had not been consistently heated to a specific temperature. In general I've found their appetizers to taste pretty \"meh\" and I admit that I don't particularly like their salads, which are very small and not always as tasty as what I'd find at other sushi restaurants.   It's hard for me to come up with a final verdict. I do think that when Katana gets it right, they really get it right; the problem is that you have to deal with a few 'meh' items along the way (i.e. tasteless ice cream and not-high-quality eggrolls) and choose carefully from a menu where for every reasonably priced and portioned item, there's another dish that's overpriced and tiny. And given that I've never really had a smooth in-house dining experience here, I personally think I'll be sticking to my favorite items on their delivery menu at this point.  All in all, for their food alone I do think Katana deserved 3 stars. (For my in-house experiences, I'd probably give them a 2-star rating.)",

Since it's a fusion restaurant - we ordered a mix of your regular chinese dish (General Tso, Shrimp Sechuan, Peppered Pork, Egg Plants, Fried Rice), few different sushi rolls, Tempura and some thai curry along with some soup and appetizers. The general Tso was good and so was all the sushi rolls but the rest of the dish were just okay. The peppered Pork were mostly all peppers with only few pieces of pork. Despite my hunger, the dish weren't just full filling or appetizing to say the least.  The server was new but friendly and attentive.  Would I go back again - Perhaps not.

    "text": "I strolled in to Katana on a Monday evening trying to satiate my sushi craving at a place I've often driven past but never stopped in to try. The place was empty with the exception of a couple of small groups in the upper dining area.  I ordered the maki platter... the waitress brought my water and included miso soup over, and that was the last I saw of her.  The soup was OK.  It had a different flavor to it than I've ever tasted when it comes to miso soup... it wasn't bad, just different. I couldn't put my finger on it.  The sushi chef delivered my maki platter, which was a salmon roll (8 pcs), spicy tuna roll (6 pcs), and california roll (6 pcs) -- a pretty great deal for $13 and some change.  I ate all but about 4 pieces... The rice was a little dried out, maybe because they weren't busy and it wasn't overly fresh.  There was also a huge difference in the size of these rolls.  The salmon roll was about the size of a quarter and maybe 1/2 inch thick while the other two rolls were more of your standard sushi size.  Personally I still think it was a great deal (bigger isn't always better), but I left here feeling like something was off about the whole experience.  Maybe it wasn't the food and instead was that I never saw my waitress again even after my water had been empty for 10 minutes, or that I had to get up and ask for my check after sitting there for another 10 minutes while the hostess texted on her phone. I'm used to a friendly, eager to please atmosphere at the sushi places I'm a regular at and I just didn't get that vibe here at all.",

    "text": "Katana is a solid Chinese-Japanese fusion restaurant. It lost some top marks by me that would have made it a five-star review, but it was overall a good meal.   Delivery: I ordered during a weekday and I found my order only took about 30 minutes to arrive. I sense, however, from reviews that those who order on the weekends face an over-taxed kitchen and delivery staff. That's an important distinction because it makes the difference between a good and bad meal.   The Good: The food is high quality. My shrimp, scallops and lobster meat were large and cooked well, and the vegetables were fresh and steamed perfectly. I had an excellent specialty sushi roll that was top-notch - if I were reviewing just the fish it would have been a 4.5. The sauce was light and I didn't feel like the food was drenched in it (never something fun).  The Bad: The wonton soup was simply average. It was very salty and the two or three little slices of chopped green onion looked sad. The wontons were that thick, chewy style. The pork roll was kind of smaller than I'm used to getting, and though it was crispy outside, inside the cabbage and pork were dried out. If I hadn't been hungry I might have put it aside.  The Ugly: The rice was great...except that they didn't give me enough of it. Yes, rice. The cheapest and easiest thing to make, the product that is so ubiquitous in Chinese fast food they are actually giving it away, and yet Katana did not fill the little white Chinese container all the way up. Seriously, who does that?! Usually I'm left with excess rice at the end of an order of Chinese food, yet here not only didn't they bother to pack the rice in, they didn't even fill the container up all the way. I actually ran. out. of. rice.  I suspect that Katana might be trying to be too much, which is why the basic wonton soup and pork roll were low to average. The fish and seafood is where they excel, which was evident by what stood out in my meal. I'd definitely come back here for sushi, but for average Chinese fast food? Naw, I'll keep trying.  UPDATE: I ordered again from Katana and the experience was the same. Average sushi, average meal, and NOT ENOUGH RICE! How hard is it to give a customer a fully packed container of white rice?!",

Ok, it's a Sunday evening, not happy but it happens.  We called at 8:45 to find out where our order was.  The cashier said they couldn't find it.  I was eventually put on with a manager who says the cashier was confused by my telephone number.  She said the food was on its way, but we continued to wait.  Delivery finally arrived at 8:55, where the delivery guy said he just left to bring it to us.. So it was super late.  Now about the food...  I've tried the general's, did not have the distinct flavor, tasted severely watered down. So it tried the orange chicken, where I found that they used the exact same sauce and add an orange peel.  Today I tried Pad Thai... It was the exact same sauce with noodles and steamed chicken with a side of lime.  Steamed chicken.  On Pad Thai.  Not even a hint of peanut to be found.  It wasn't even an attempt at real Pad Thai.  I have had the real deal many times.  My daughter's curry was also not even close to True Thai curry.  In all honesty I will not order here again.",

Then they took hunk of uncooked onion the size of your head, peanut dust, and squishy meat stuffs and tossed it together.  Gross.  Also ordered the gyoza appetizer.  I would bet $100 they are the frozen ones from Trader Joes.  Taste, texture, look ... all the same.  Which is fine if you spent the price you do at Trader Joe's to cook them at home.  But, nope.

    "text": "My mom loves hibachi, and after reading all of the hibachi restaurant reviews in Pittsburgh, Katana was the clear choice! Four of us dined here together around Mother's Day. Though the restaurant is located in an inconspicuous section of the south hills, I was surprised how spacious and recently renovated the interior of Katana is.  We made reservations here and were promptly seated when we arrived. We started with Crab Rangoons, which I really enjoyed. Two of us ordered hibachi while the other two of us ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken. We were told that the Sweet & Sour Chicken was not made in house, but I thought it was tasty. Our portions were large, and it was definitely the bestSweet & Sour that I've eaten in some time.   We watched a hibachi show that a young chef put on for the large group of 12 or so sitting next to us. He joked around with the children, gave everyone shots of sake, tossed around his utensils, and set an impressive fire. Our hibachi chef was just for the four of us and was not quite as skilled. He spent less time entertaining and made a few mistakes when tossing around his utensils. I did get some pretty great pictures of the fire he set though. Both my husband and mom liked their dishes, and my mom was really impressed by the quantity of food that she received.  I thought the value for the quantity and quality of food that we received was fantastic. I would definitely come back here again and would love to try some sushi next time!",

    "text": "As a new member of the Dormont hood, I was super excited to see this pop up. One because I love sushi and two because... I LOVE SUSHI!   You never know, when a new sushi joint pops up, if you'll experience the good or the bad. Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's really really bad. I am happy to report it was very really good! Was it better than my all time fave, Penn Ave Fish Co? No, the fish wasn't as fresh. But it was very tasty and I will be hittin' up this joint often... even grabbed a to go menu. Because, you know, I'll be hitting them up on the go often now!  I came on Wednesday for their all you can eat sushi special for $23.95. You know how some all you can eats are the dinky rolls only? Well, here you can get the whole shebang! Want that specialty tempura roll? You got it! Want a Rainbow roll? You can have it... all you can eat!  The Spicy Girl Roll was my fave, which is pretty much tuna on top of crunchy tuna. But a very close second, if not equal, was the Godzilla roll. Gosh darnit, it was amazeballs! It came out warm and freshly fried (totally healthy, right?) with cream cheese, white tuna, eel and crab. YUM! I also had a good old faithful philly roll and Amazing roll, which was basically tuna as well. I obviously like tuna.   I can't wait to come back and try the Hibachi. Probably stuff my face again. Let's keep it real here!  Warning: All you can eat sushi cannot be combined with a Yelp Deal. If you do not finish what's on your place you're charged upwards of a $1. So don't let your eyes be bigger then your stomach! Once you order, you can always place another one. Don't worry, either way, you'll be rolling yourself out!",

Food wasn't here for an hour. Called back after 1:15. They said it was in a few minutes late. Called back after 2 hours! Was told it was a technical difficulty. When asked if we could get a discount we were told to \"Man up and pay for food\".   Avoid this place. Try Thai spoon, tong garden, Mekong, or amazing wok. Shoot, try McDonald over this joint.   Your food isn't that good. Sayonara suckers.",

This is clearly a Chinese owned restaurant, no matter what they are trying to make ( Japanese, Thai, etc), it will be  reminiscent of Chinese food. I get their delivery and I have been there to eat. Service is fast and friendly. The food is good quality.   I typically don't care for hibachi because of the dried out meat, but the meat here is tender and juicy every time. I'm ashamed to say I do eat here at least once a week (because I should be cooking at home). The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get.   Highly recommended for just a relaxing date night in for some good Chinese or Japanese delivery!",

This is my and my husband's go-to when we want to get a lot for cheap as the Groupon never seems to expire. It's been on there for at least 3 years from what I've noticed. Note: the maximum for getting one Groupon deal is three times. I would know since I've gotten my limit of Groupons for Katana. The Chinese dishes and the sushi are not too bad, maybe a bit higher than average as far as Chinese-American dishes and sushi go. The quality is decent and better than a lot of places I've tried, but you'll have better at Sesame Inn up the street. But do not come for hibachi. Maybe not all the hibachi chefs there are bad, but the chef we had over-salted EVERYTHING. Our rice was swimming in soy sauce and it was inedible. Not even the yum yum sauce could fix it, which is hard to do since yum yum sauce is good with everything! Overall, it's very clean, you'll get good service, and the Chinese food and sushi are decent.",

    "text": "Did someone say \"All you can eat sushi\"!?!  I accept the challenge!!  I may regret this decision later, but I accept.  Another hidden gem in Dormont, Katana has the hibachi grills, handmade sushi, and (in my opinion) a great location - across from the Nissan dealership - AKA right by the Tstop.  This way you can stop in then waddle back to the T after your stuffed with deliciousness.  I've tried both their hibachi and sushi - what can I say, I love the cuisine.  The hibachi is perfect if you come with family or larger group.  However if you come as a duo, grab a seat at the grill, make some friends and enjoy the show.  If only I had the skill these chefs have...  Also before you visit, check places like Groupon for special hibachi only deals!  Sushi is always fresh and beautiful - a work of art presented to you on a plate that I find hard to consume... yet I'll attempt to work the chopsticks and dive right in!  From the standard rainbow roll to their Cowgirl, everything is delicious.    Want to try as many rolls as possible?  Come Monday through Thursday and indulge in ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!!  For under $24 per person, you can have an appetizer, sashimi, sushi, and maki rolls until you BURST!!  They do have a surcharge if you leave uneaten rolls on the plate - so make sure you only order what you can eat.  The waitstaff will provide you with order sheets, if you wish, every time you clean a plate.  If you're looking for a tasty (or glutenous) experience, stop by Katana.  If you see me in the back stuffing my face with sushi... don't judge me :)",

We decided to give it another try a few months later and we were very happy about our decision to go back! For less than $24 a person, you can order anything your heart desires. The sushi is very good and the appetizers are equally as good. My favorites are the crab rangoons and every choice of sushi on their menu. It's made to order, so everything is super fresh too!

The clear soup was just like everyone else's, delicious. The fried rice was very good, veggies were cooked in a really delicious sauce. The yum yum and the ginger sauce were very good.

It was late, but I was confident that I could put away some food in a short period of time.  The woman in the front explained that they closed at 10, which was fine - she was polite about it. The waitress was great, very attentive and sweet (even though we were officially THOSE people who showed up 40 minutes before closing time)  Food was brought out almost immediately, great flavor & quality. Sushi was MOSTLY fish, not MOSTLY rice - it's rare that you find this. My large miso soup was LARGE - enough for two days. All portions were a very nice size.  Upon checking out, the woman in the front was pretty much telling off our waitress because she forgot to add my wine to the check - ridiculous if you ask me. They made us swipe our credit card again to pay for the wine - while the woman was still yelling at our server. Honestly, that was the only thing that I could say that was an issue this evening. The waitress handled it great though - she was awesome & I would ask for her again when we come back.",

It was incredibly fresh and I found a new favorite roll that I've never seen anywhere before called the Snow White roll-made with snow crab, avocado and topped with white tuna- so good!  AYCE  was $23.95 which is a little pricier but for me and my trusty sidekick it was worth it because it was fresher and tastier than we both remembered and it was so close we could walk there.  You can also order from some soups and appetizers along with all the sushi but we focused mainly on the sushi.  I can't comment on the hibachi or Chinese food since we ate only the sushi.  P.s.  they have reasonable prices for bottles of wine too!",

We ordered our top 5  favorites: salmon roe / salmon sushi, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna roll, Philadelphia roll and TWO Snow White rolls. The Snow White roll is that good! I haven't seen that roll anywhere else, which makes Katana's worth the trip. All you can eat sushi available Mon-Thurs. Go early because the special is only available 'til 8:30. We went on a Friday because we had a Snow White craving.  Gave 4/5 stars because not most romantic date place, not the sexy sushi vibe of Umami in Lawrenceville. It is a nice comfortable place to go with good friends who want to eat good sushi and talk and laugh.",

The spicy tuna roll had a really good flavor.  The other two were also really good and fresh.  The egg rolls were not crisp and lacked any flavor.

    "text": "Nah, this place is definitely not getting any future business from me.  We came in for all you can eat sushi that a coworker recommended to us.   I'm not trying to say that restaurants should not charge for waste for AYCE. But I think it is necessary to remind/mention for the waste charge. At the end, we have some left on the plate and they told us the waste charge is $1 for a piece left on the plate. Our waitress didn't mention anything about it even after she told us,\"there is no chance that you guys will leave here hungry\"! Take one star off from there. At the end, they charged us $15 for the leftover and let us to bring them home. We definitely overestimated ourselves but there comes to my second point. Old ingredients!  All the sashimi didn't taste fresh, tuna look brown! Shrimp were cut into slices(never had shrimp like that, it look like either pressed or just slice one shrimp into 2-3pieces shrimp), eel was old/over cooked and the best of all of them was salmon which is just like 5 out of 10 grade. Ordered some gyoza and they were fine, hard to mess up with that. It just they served it warm not hot. Make me wonder if they microwaved it then fry it for a minute. I've made gyoza at home or other restaurants and I remember them being a little bit warmer than that. Fried dumplings, my husband spit it out after one bite!   Sushi! Here is the what came here for. They are not bad I have to admit. But not outstanding either. Looking at how old are their sashimi, it's hard to make me believe that the sushi are fresh.   At the end, I understand they want to close on time so everybody who work there can go home. But, is it really necessary to clean to floor by our table while we are still eating? Ah, I forgot to mention the beer was flat as well.   Overall, like I said in the beginning, not going back. But if someone is hungry for sushi, I guess it is not a bad deal to go there to eat sushi only. But there are so many places where you can spend $30 and have 2 rolls that is fresh and tasty.",

    "text": "I'll be honest, I was a little skeptical about the 3.5 star rating until I read the poor reviews- most of them were the result of the delivery service.  Now, this review is rather on the dine in service, specifically the AYCE option Sunday-Thursday.  We came in around 5:20, it was a ghost town. A row of takeout orders were laid out on the sushi bar, but we sat in a booth.  The servers were attentive, obviously with nothing to do, glanced at us from the distance. This worked out very nicely so that we could order everything in a paced manner rather than flagging down a running server.   So, we placed our order, and thus began the AYCE feast. It took maybe 20 minutes or so from when we walked in to the time we got our first round, they forgot some things, which turned out to just be on another plate that would come later. They did, however, forget the spicy tuna nigiri I had ordered, but honestly finishing most of everything was difficult for me- the person I was with was not that hungry that day and I refuse to be a victim of leftover fees!  We had six rolls and sashimi. For AYCE, this place stands out because they offer sashimi. The downside? Small, thin, sashimi. At the same time, you can order more so it's not a big deal. Just got to be wary for the next time.   The salmon and eel were phenomenal. Albacore and white tuns were not noteworthy  We had the:  Tiger roll-amazing, the mango sauce really complemented the lobster    godzilla roll x2- perfect temperature and texture. Best whole fried roll Ive had from anywhere, even SoCal  dynamite roll- Perfect temperature and texture, also really good, but godzilla had a better compilation of flavor  2 in 1 roll- very nice  fire island roll- a favorite, the tempura flakes in both the spicy tuna and spicy lobster were amazing  terrific roll- really nice! The sauce on the top was neat.",

We sat at the bar and looked over the menu. They had a lunch special for around $15 for an assortment of fish plus a roll based on the chef's pick. I wasn't sure if I wanted the fish picked for me, but my friend clarified with the waitress it wasn't going to be anything crazy. It was more along the lines of salmon and tuna, which we could totally roll with (get it..roll..ha..).  We both ended up with the lunch special and it turned out really, really good. The plate came with two pieces of salmon, two pieces of tuna, and two pieces of another fish. I think it may have been yellowtail though I'm not completely sure. Then it had three pieces of nigiri sushi with one salmon, one tuna, and one possibly yellowtail. There was a six piece crunchy type roll that tasted really good. It was definitely filling and amazing. I was really pleased with the quality of fish and the price for it all. Of course our waitress was sweet and attentive. I would hope so if we're the only customers. I did run to the bathroom to wash my hands and it was clean, which is always a plus. I would definitely come back to get more of my fish fix.",

You start by selecting what items you want off their all-you-can-eat menu which does not include everything off their regular menu, but it was still a decent selection nonetheless. There are also appetizers included like vegetable gyoza, noodles, edamame, etc. Although they have specific rolls they offer, they were open to my different customization requests which was great. The sushi served was of good quality and came out pretty quickly after we submitted our order. My favorite was the sweet potato tempura roll. SO GOOD! The overall experience was great, except for the fact that our waitress would disappear for long periods of time. Probably a sign that she wanted us to stop eating all their sushi.",

Too many options, it's overwhelming..stick to one style of food and master that style.  I could pretty much tell the food was going to be so so from the appetizer. We ordered the vegetable spring rolls. Very basic & the dipping sauce was not so great. Bland & not much flavor.  My husband & I ordered a bunch of different sushi pieces to split. We tried about 6 different ones & none of them stood out. Pretty basic, none of them had a flavor that popped.  Our waitress was nice & helpful when we had questions.

This place is awesome and needs some support in Dormont!  My husband and I went here after trying to get drinks at Cain's - which I love, but for some reason, no one would serve us.  So we headed over to Asian heaven aka Katana.  It's very pretty inside - not what you are expecting on this end of West Liberty.  They sat us in the front window near the tables for hibachi, but far enough way that the roaring cooking noises would be distracting.  We decided to get both hibachi and sushi to try it out - and we are so glad we did!  J had the special dragon roll - spicy tuna inside, lobster salad and jalepeno outside.  He also got the phoenix roll which was awesome.  I had the shrimp and scallop hibachi.  First comes the typical, but always awesome salad with ginger dressing and the bowl of miso soup.  Then comes a massive plate heaped with giant scallops, huge shrimp, more crunchy vegetables than I could handle and delicious fried rice.  The sauces were excellent and a bit different than I have had other places.    When they bring your check, they also bring some fruit sliced up which is a nice addition to the bill.   All in all - some of the best sushi in the city and some delicious hibachi make this a worthwhile place to try - and help out.  Keep Katana open and stop by :)",

For whatever reason this weekend, their excuse was that they decided to do all you can eat sushi (which is usually just a Sunday through Thursday thing) and they didn't anticipate a crowd?  It's Saturday night!  It's always busy!  So the results were it took over an hour and a half to get our food when it usually takes 20 min and when it finally arrived, they forgot half of the sushi order!  I've been to other excellent sushi places where they will put as many chefs behind the sushi counter as necessary to keep up with demand... But not with katana.  I've had dine in issues before at katana where they are slammed on a Wednesday and only have one guy to do all the sushi.  Now it's affecting the weekend orders as well?  Completely unacceptable for as place open as long as they have and really makes me feel like they are choosing profits over customer satisfaction.  If you are going to offer all you can eat sushi for dine in, open up that pocket book and HIRE some more chefs!",

Now I get that Hibachi uses butter, but I also don't like my Hibachi so greasy that I have a gut ache when I get home. Katana delivers. It was delicious and I didn't feel like I consumed a gallon of butter after wards. The sushi is also delicious. Both time that I've ordered it has been fantastic. Here's my beef. They advertise their All-You-Can-Eat sushi nights. We went on one occasion, and my friend being a huge fun a sushi ordered. They have these silly rules that you have to finish everything on your plate if you order all-you-can-eat or they surcharge you. Why? I don't understand why we could have taken a few pieces home. Also, our waiter literally stood across the room and stared at us to watch friend finish his second plate of sushi. That was super irritating. I don't like to be stared down while I eat.  Other than that I have not experienced issues with the service. It's fast and friendly. I will definitely be back to Katana, but not for all-you-can-eat sushi. I don't enjoy being the staff's show.",

    "text": "I came to Katana for the first time last Friday, January 2nd.  There were 4 people in my party. We made a reservation for the Hibachi. We were seated immediately. Our waitress came over and got our drink orders and came back with them fairly promptly. Next, she took our food orders. I personally don't like hibachi so I wanted to order Basil Noodles. I was informed that those weren't available so I ordered Lo Mein instead. The salads were brought out quickly by another member of your wait staff. This waitress was asked by multiple people for refills and chopsticks since our waitress had disappeared. Our chef, Clint, was AWESOME! Very funny guy. Very talkative. And the 3 other people in my group that got hibachi were very happy with their meals. During the \"hibachi show\" put on by Clint, our waitress came back to the table to check drinks for 5 of the other patrons at our table and one member of our group but never the 3 remaining. Not once did she try to offer us another beverage or just check to make sure we were ok(and we were the only people at the table having alcoholic beverages)! The hibachi show finished and most people at the table were nearly done with their meals and my lo mein had yet to be seen. Clint was concerned and tried to ask the girl that was at the front counter about it but she offered no assistance. Finally our waitress came over and I had to motion her over to me as she was ignoring me! She said, Oh! Your food will be done soon! And then she go away from us as quick as possible. Did she go check on my food in the kitchen? Nope! To add insult to injury, she went to the hibachi table next to us to check on their drinks. Another 10 minutes go by and everyone is done with their food and mine finally comes out. When she puts the food down and 3 of us asked for more drinks since we finally had her. She came back over with our drinks. I ate BY MYSELF. Then asked for our bill. I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT OUR SERVICE. I am NOT one of THOSE people. But, it was just not acceptable. She said, sorry after she listed a bunch of excuses as to why my food took so long.  And I said ok, but you never checked on our drinks.  She offered to take $5 off the bill. I would have expected a little more than that.  Overall, the food was good but the service was seriously disappointing!   I would give 4 Stars to the food and the Chef, Clint.  But the overall service was TERRIBLE.",

Instead of three rolls, I received two trays of sushi that looked extremely similar, instead of the three different sushi rolls that I ordered.  I asked the delivery person about this error. The delivery man said that he was unaware of what happened, but would ask at the restaurant and let me know.  I waited long enough for Katana to call and explain, but did not receive a response.  I called the restaurant and explained my concerns. The employee on the phone was aware of the situation, and said that the sushi only looked similar, but was in fact different.  When I read the description of the sushi from the menu, which clearly outlined the significant difference in each of the three sushi types I ordered, the employee said that the chef \"must have forgotten\" to put some of the vegetables on the sushi.  I asked if in the future I would need to specify exacly what I would like on each roll, to which she said, \"Yes, sometimes people do not like cucumbers.\"  Not once did the employee apologize for this error, let alone offer the delivery person to send the correct order or provide me a refund.  The sushi that was delivered tasted old, leading me to believe that the restaurant simply wanted to get rid of their inventory before the close of business.  I am very unhappy with not only the food product, but the horrible customer service as well.  I would not recommend ordering delivery from this restaurant.",

There is something on the menu for everyone - hibachi, thai, sushi, etc.  The sushi was very good, price is very competitive with Little Tokyo just up the road, though could be considered a tad on the pricey side when compared to Sushi Kim in the Strip District.  Delicious food though, can't wait to go again!",

I ordered their Hibachi for delivery a couple times and am always slightly disappointed because my vegetables and meat are usually in water? Literal water. I am never disappointed when eating it there though. Everyone is so nice and the food is always so good!",

We worry that they aren't busy but it is great for getting a quick table. I think that we like it so much because of it's convenience but there food is very good.  Everything we have had here is great, sushi, hibachi and appetizers. Their hibachi chicken is really great and the portion sizes are generous.",

Every time I've been there we sat at the hibachi table, but I like that they offer other asian varieties of food so everyone can find something they like. My new favorite thing about this place is that they deliver to my house. This is my go to place for ordering Chinese food. You can even get the hibachi menu  items delivered. Delivery is timely and the food is always good. I will continue to get delivery from Katana.  The online ordering is also a plus!",
