    "text": "A family-owned restaurant with a great wine list in my own neighborhood? Yes, please! My husband and made a reservation for 8pm and were promptly seated. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive.   We each loved our wine choices - and both were reasonable for the quality at $9/glass. We started with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with Horseradish Aoli. At $13, I feel this appetizer was a bit on the expensive side but, as I'd heard, the sauce was outstanding. We both moved on to a Spinach Salad with Peppered Strawberries, Red Onion, Goat Cheese, Egg, and Candied Walnuts. It was a delicious iteration a traditional spinach salad - and both my balsamic and my husband's raspberry vinaigrette were excellent. For dinner, I had the Twin Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese and Port Wine Demi Glaze. The meat was expertly butchered and cooked; the sauce was a good consistency and flavor; and, my portions of the two sides - green beans almondine and roasted red potatoes - were gigantic. My husband had the Stuffed Lobster Ravioli in a Cream Vodka Tomato Sauce, which looked a bit small on the portion side; however, he cleaned his plate and I didn't hear any complaints.  Our entire bill--two glasses of wine, an appetizer, $2 upcharge on the salad choices, an entrees (which included the two sides)--was only $85. I find this to be extremely reasonable for piping hot, fresh, well executed food that (1) I can walk to and (2) can support my local economy. We absolutely plan to make this our new \"spot\" for date night!",

We all had different entrees but the bartender put our order in properly and kept our glasses full. We received our food in a reasonable amount of time and it was cooked perfectly.  I had a fried chicken cutlet, served on a biscuit, with pan gravy with a salad and a side of potatoes. It reminded me of visiting my grandmother in North Carolina. It was so tasty and tender and the biscuit was soft and delicious. The other entrees were just as good. This will be a weekly stop for us from now on.",

I tried this place for dinner on a recent business trip based on the reviews. it certainly did live up to what most people say about it. I ordered grilled salmon - not a very risky choice but one that often provides a clue to the quality of the food. It was very tasty, cooked to my liking and well-seasoned. This is a small place that has definitely been there for a while. The decor is bland and during the week, seems to attract local baby boomers. My only complaint was dessert - I ordered carrot cake and it was very cold, like it had been in a refrigerator for a while to try to keep it longer. Other than that, the food and service were great. Will visit again if I have the chance...",

Great, classic hardwood bar area, TV's muted to sports channels. Service was slow at times.  Food well priced for what you get - heaping portions of healthy, modern gastropub food. Chicken and fish dishes (I sampled the tables) were tasty and well seasoned.  Sauces, condiments and dressings are PHENOMENAL. They best any $50/plate restaurant. Salads are mixed greens. Each entree comes with 2 sides. Steamed veggies were crisp and well seasoned; sweet potato fries were spot on.  Wine and beer list are extremely well priced - Woodchuck is $3/bottle.  All in all, it's a great neighborhood restaurant. It's not fine dining, it's not casual - and it hits the spot.  Two things are worth coming back for, time and time again: the sauces/dressings/condiments and the well priced alcohol list.",

The food was blah - nothing special.  My tuna was overcooked and dry.  The service was horrendous.  It was a Saturday night and not busy, yet our waitress had a very hard time keeping up with her 3 tables (2 people per table).   I asked for extra sauce for my tuna, and she brought me a tiny cup with 1/8 inch of sauce in it.  I guess that's all they felt they could spare.  It was also FREEZING inside.  I sat there with my husband's ski coat on my lap for 20 minutes before I could flag her down to see if she would turn on the heat.  The atmosphere has changed too.  It used to be dimly lit and romantic.  This time the lights were so bright it felt like we were at the dentist.  The waitress knew I was unhappy with my meal, and she said \"well, that's how it always is.\"  I was so displeased that I immediately emailed the owner when we got home.  That was 3 weeks ago.  No response.  I always think when it comes to bad service, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  The new ownership leaves a lot to be desired.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",

    "text": "Great food (seriously some of the most flavorful I've had in a long time)... great waitress... and a hostess with an attitude that gave us the \"you're not a local so we don't want you here\" vibe. We arrived tonight (a Wednesday) at 5pm for an early dinner after a long day at work. We were asked how many in our party(only 4 of us) and asked if we had a reservation; when we replied no, we were greeted with a gruff huff of attitude as she tried to figure out how to place a party of four at the only available table of four left (that didn't have customers or a reserved sign already). She then exclaimed that next time we should know to book a reservation. I get it, it's a small restaurant (10 tables max with a large bar area), they want a heads-up, but we are from out of town and had no way of knowing that. Immediately made me think I was going to leave a one or two star review. Our waitress and her upbeat personality and the amazing food bumped this up to a four star (yes, it's that good)! I ordered the tomato bisque instead of their salad to start (but heard from my coworkers that the Italian dressing was one of the best they had) and was very impressed with the flavor. Had the two filet dinner with red potatoes and broccoli (the picture doesn't do it justice)! Steak was tender and cooked perfect! Potatoes were well seasoned and garnished with basil which paired perfectly with the sauce on the steak! I would definitely recommend eating here, but would definitely recommend going early (it really started to get busy around 6) and would SERIOUSLY recommend a reservation so as to avoid the same sour note that our dining experience started with!",

Seriously high-quality appetizers and entrees for an appropriate price (a fellow diner I was with got duck, which was $22 for a smallish portion, but that's about the only overpriced offering I noticed).   I personally had the Jamaican jerk chicken, as well as a wedge salad, and both were truly phenomenal. The menu isn't huge but offers a wide variety of cultural cuisines with some sauces and sides that are a bit more elevated than your usual sit-down place, like ratatouille, green beans almandine, carrot cole slaw, etc.   Our service was outstanding. Our waiter balanced the art of checking on us too little and too much perfectly. He was very attentive , and also saved me tons of money by substituting someone else's salad for the iceberg wedge I ordered, which I greatly appreciated.   I would've dressed a little more nicely if I had known more about The Mighty Oak beforehand. It has low lighting and nuanced decoration, and is small/personal. It's a great place to bring a date! I thought it might be more of a casual place, but it definitely is more appropriate for a slow, quiet dinner with good friends.   The Mighty Oak Barrel is an all-around great restaurant with emphasis on quality and service. Definitely recommended!",

No drinks in menu, bar takes up most the space inside. Small menu and very high priced. 14 for a piece of fried chicken on a biscuit with pan gravy and 6 bucks for a Caesar salad with mostly the butt of the lettuce in it. She got the fish and it came out very light in color. Had little to no taste until one huge spot of the most rancid dirty fishy fish taste. I got the steak sandwich with Rostand red potatoes and wow was i disappointed. First bit had the hardest piece of gristle or a bone in it ever and then the rest was iffy at best. Pieces of decent steak and pieces of the worst hardest chewiest steak. The red potatoes were more like small burnt rocks on my plate. And the smell in there was weird to describe at best. Service was poor. Our waitress was more attentive to her conversation at the bar with the bartender and other server than to us. I seriously would not return there if you paid me to. The bread that came to the table was good though and while being described as from the oven it's wasn't barely room temp and was clearly just a sliced baguette, but thank god it was there!!!",

I came in alone because I am traveling on business and was greeted in an unfriendly manner, as though the server was completely shocked that a party of one would be dining in. The server stood far away from me to greet me, take my order, and pushed my food onto the table in the most literal form of \"dropping off\" rather than putting it remotely close to me. The Maryland crab cake was fried which was the biggest disappointment (but also why you don't order MD specialties outside of MD). My fries were cold by the time the server finally brought me ketchup, which I asked for three times! When my meal was totally insufficient, I asked to order a side salad and again, was met by confusion from my server. I ordered the beet salad which appeared to be sliced beets that came from a can. Unbelievably terrible service and the one compliment I was going to throw out there was the fries were decent but even that is a stretch. Unless my server was an alien who never has eaten in a restaurant, there's no explanation for why the service was so despicable. Don't bother unless you're local, I guess. I would absolutely give this place no stars if possible.",

The service was excellent, our waiter who seemed to be running the place was very friendly and gave us some great recommendations. They have a nice cocktail list. We started with the Cubanelle Peppers which were very good. I had the Beer Battered Fish of the Day Sandwich, it was cod today. The fish was great, breaded very lightly. Honestly, would've probably been fine with just the fish on it's own. Prices are very reasonable. Would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

Based on the recommendations of other reviews, I made a reservation for the 4 of us on a Friday evening. I'm really glad I did, too, because it got quite crowded!   The atmosphere was cozy. The tables in my area are close enough that navigating to the bathroom was like navigating a waist-high hedge maze, but not so close that seating was uncomfortable. There's also a bar area with several TVs.  The food was good. I honestly don't remember what I ordered, but I'm pretty sure I ate it all. The menu is larger than I expected for a place so small, and it seems like a good mix of traditionally Euro-American fare that is common in this region: burgers, fish, pasta, salads, etc. My friend took his leftover pasta home to his wife, and she told me she enjoyed it, too.  Staff was friendly, drinks were prompt, our orders were correct, and other customers were loud (as per any neighborhood bar and grill on a Friday evening) but certainly not impolite.  Everyone in the group asked me if I'd been there before, because it definitely feels like a little cozy gem of a restaurant known mostly by locals. I can thank online reviews for pointing me here!",

    "text": "Truly, this one star review was earned by The Might Oak Barrel for its grotesque decor, failures in adequate service, disappointing fare, and overall lacking quality for a restaurant in the famed downtown of Oakmont.  My colleagues and I hosted a well-respected Oakmont resident at lunch at somewhere other than the typical Hoffstots or Chelsea Grille. This was our first occasion to visit the \"Barrel.\"  Upon entry (around 1230pm) we were treated to a most disturbing collecting of horrific art, Fiesta-ware plates, and no oak barrel (a place called the \"Mighty Oak Barrel\" actually has an oak barrel, right? Nope...). On the wooden bar rested a clothes basket filled with unfolded table linens, a work-in-progress schedule of servers, and a hodgepodge of cleaning supplies. This was not during the late afternoon \"slow hours\" where you might expect to catch the staff cleaning and organizing, rather these chores were being completed on the bar, in the middle of the restaurant, during the lunch rush.  One woman acted alone as the sole bartender, hostess, waitress, table busser, and cashier. Although I do feel bad for her having to act in every possible capacity other than the cook, I do feel her employer needs to reevaluate its business plan. After an incredibly long wait, our orders were taken - but nothing served without error.  The food that was delivered was nothing to impress (see the burned beyond reason Reuben I could not bear to finish).   ...Any good review must evaluate the restroom and this is one to note. The men's restroom lacks a door on it's only toilet stall and lacks any locking mechanism on the main restroom door. Better hold it...  In the parking lot leading to the front door, a smelly and filthy grease trap sits prominently to great patrons.   I would not recommend visiting The Mighty Oak Barrel.",
