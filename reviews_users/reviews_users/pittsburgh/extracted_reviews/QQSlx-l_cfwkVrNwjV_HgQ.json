My standard order is Chicken Lo Mein and vegetable rolls and that has been constantly delicious.  There's also a variety of American and Japanese food on the menu, which is a little confusing and I've avoided trying that thus far.  I've never eaten-in, but there is a dining area if you're not a local.",

    "text": "I ate here for dinner last night with a dining companion.  The decor of the restaurant is interesting with a large fish tank dominating the room over by the kitchen and various Chinese knickknacks throughout.  Upon being seated they start you out with a bowl of fried wontons with both sweet and sour sauce and spicy mustard to complement it.  For my entree I ordered the General Tso's Chicken while my dining companion ordered the Cashew Chicken.  The General Tso's sauce here was a bit different than the sauce that you will find at most Chinese restaurants but still tasted good.  I also was able to taste some of the Cashew Chicken which was also tasted pleasantly.  One thing I would like to note is that although the servers were efficient, I had a general cold feeling from them that you normally do not get.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again.  None of the food was spectacular but the price was right.",

When an hour had passed we called back and told them that it was now 20 minutes past their quoted time and they then said the drivers was on his way and it would be another 10-20 minutes making it nearly double the amount of time they told us.  I called back and spoke to the owner and said that this was unacceptable and I wanted a partial refund of my order.  My total was $24.45 and she offered to only take 4.45 off.   Additionally, once the food did arrive it was terrible, I asked for a spice level of 2 and my entree was completely covered with red pepper flakes and I could barely eat it.   I want to make it clear that I will NEVER order from House of Lee again and urge you to avoid them too.",

Never had my drink refilled nor was asked if everything was okay. I had to seek them out so I could get my bill so I can get out of there.

    "text": "Very unsatisfied!!! ridiculously overpriced!!! Shitty customer service!! Just received my order of tofu and veggies and veggie mei fun with fried rice and steamed rice. When I opened the bag and pull out the food half the tofu and veggies meal spilled in the bag because it was not closed correctly. Both meals I ordered were small and it cost $18 including tip and a $2 dollar delivery charge! the amount of food and quality is totally not worth 18 dollars. You will not be getting the same amount of food you would at other Chinese food restaurants and the price will be much higher. Their online menu says one price that is not correct, so don't be fooled. Online both my meals were 5.95 but when I received the deliver I got charged 7.95 for each! which is ridiculous. that is a huge difference considering they were only small sizes. At any other restaurant that would be the price of a large an probably have three times the amount of food. I called to tell them about my food spilling in the bag and also complain about the change in price and the \"fried rice\" - which was just which rice with scrambled eggs inside.. not real fried rice. The owner apologized that the food spilled but did not offer to resend the food because of their mistake. She also was aware that the menu prices were different but had not changed it because its \"difficult\".. sounds like laziness to me! She also said that their fried rice is healthier because than the typical fried rice.. I don't see how since they omitted the veggies was very greasy and was not made fresh- I know this because I asked to make it without eggs and they said they are not made to order.. which means the rice they make probably once a day just sits there and is sold throughout the day. I don't see how that is healthier.. But in conclusion. I will not be ordering from this restaurant again.",

    "text": "Note: The receipt says it's in Emsworth, PA. Hmmm.   That mystical sign of theirs beckons us each time we are en route to Kay's home if she decides to take her preferred way to Boom-Chip-A-Wah-Wah (or is it Beaver Falls?).    What we found Friday night after deciding to stop in after passing it so often was a remarkably unpretentious bar-n-grill that just happens to have mostly Chinese fare on their menu along with steak, fish sandwiches and...cheeseburgers?   We were seated next to a large aquarium full of exotic fish. Speaking of exotic, the bar was packed with a motley crew of locals who were being entertained by the antics of the two high-strung little boys that ran about with action figures in their hands. Mom scolded them for going into the bar and closed the door after a while.   What is it with Asian restaurants and children? I love it, really. It's especially precious when they get you refills and ask how your meal is.   I kid you not. Prior to coming here, I'd never had Egg Fu Yung before. When I saw it on the menu, my dilemma as to what to order had been solved. I got mine with lobster.  I had no idea it was an omelet/frittata entity coated in a sort of gravy.   I also had no idea that Egg Fu Yung was so good, and the portion was titanic. I think I got 6 flaps of egg and lobster. The lobster held up well, wasn't overcooked, and tasted like lobster should.   My fried rice, which came on the side, was passable but could have used more flavor.   Kay got a seafood combo of sorts that included scallops among other things and seemed to rather enjoy it. I can attest to the scallops being quite tasty.   Our potstickers were a solid appetizer, but fell a tad short of being the best ever specimen of my favored Chinese snack. The steamed wrapper was doughy and had plenty of pork filling, and as with everything else we ordered, the portion was quite generous.   I almost ordered a banana split for dessert (I know!) but decided to share a cheesecake with Kay instead. The cheesecake tasted frozen and store-bought, but I minded not as it placated my angry sweet tooth just fine. I would have liked to have eaten a banana split at a Chinese restaurant though, just to say I did, but I didn't want to overdo it.   What is it with me and cheesecake lately?   Anyway, I enjoyed the fine food and jovial, laid-back atmosphere enough to rate House of Lee 4 stars along with everyone else who has reviewed it thus far.   P.S.  I didn't even hear one curse word uttered by any of the fellas who bellied up at the bar. Imagine that. The gal who runs this place must not take any crap from anyone.",

My only complaint was the service. The waitress rolled her eyes like a typical American teenager at the onerous chore of showing us to our table. The waitress brought us out order and muttered so badly we could not understand her. We said that is not what we ordered then she walked away saying \" you don't even know what you order?\". The portions were ample, and when we asked for some boxes, she said \"I  bring you one big one\". I said no please we have two seperate dinners\". She returned with two tiny boxes and literally threw them down on the table.      I gave them a second chance. This time I ordered general tsos chicken. She brought me sesame chicken instead. I ate it as I  had to go to work. I was pleasantly surprised. I have to give them mixed reviews as the food is better than average, but they treat you as if you were beggers looming for a handout.

    "text": "After being bombarded with front-page Pennysaver ads, I decided to give this place a try. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, but I didn't really want to eat another pizza either.  I decided on the General Tso's, which in this case is made from chicken breast. Foodie Travesty: I really hate chicken thigh meat. Don't tell anyone. It's just so gristly and... poultry-fat-tasting. Drumsticks? Bring it on. Wings? Oh yes. Thighs? ...not unless they've been slathered in barbeque sauce and cooked within an inch of their (dearly departed) lives. Anyway, the fried chunks are rather more reminiscent of sweet and sour chicken; large and with a crunchy batter. The sauce is sort of amazing: Tangy, sweet, a little spicy and worthy of serious cravings. The broccoli isn't overcooked, and there are plenty of onions to go around (a plus, if you ask me). I was kind of enchanted by my entirely inauthentic dinner.  I don't love their fried rice; it doesn't have egg, unless you ask for it specifically (and pay extra), and I think mine is better. Muhahaha.  However, my top #1 most foremost important criterion for judging Chinese places is their dumpling selection. Would you believe that, in Adrian, so few people order dumplings that most of the Chinese restaurants don't even sell them? Really. But House of Lee does, and they're delicious. The filling is decent if unremarkable, the dough is great, they're perfectly pan-fried, and the dipping sauce is excellent (if maybe a little like candy). If they had har gow, I would give them five stars, but they don't.  Definitely worth checking out, and I'll certainly order again. The phone service is friendly if a bit rushed, and delivery was quick. There's really nothing like Chinese delivery and trashy TV to make a bad night after work a whole lot better.",

The sauce was actually decent - if only there would have been more than just a tablespoon.  The breading was quite slimy and I don't think it was from the sauce because as I said, it barely covered the bottom of the container.  I also got chicken lo mein and that had a very odd flavor (not very Chinese-like) and it didn't have much chicken in it. It was mostly noodles, whole green beans, and mushrooms.  The only other time I ate there, I was a bit put-off because there were bare footed children running around the restaurant (the owners kids maybe?) and there was an older asian woman with a cigarette in her mouth;  yelling at them.  It was just very odd.   Prices are good but as the saying goes: you get what you pay for.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.",

Down in Coraopolis, finding good Chinese food can be a bit of a challenge, but if you are willing to drive down the OHR Blvd this place will not disappoint you.   It's not authentic Chinese, but it is not your typical Americanized Chinese food either. This place has character and flavor that deserve your attention, not to mention prices are dirt cheap for the portions they give you. My favorite here was always the Mu Shu Pork, which was neither greasy nor heavy, nor covered under a bed of cabbage. It was light, the pancakes were warm and just the right size, and the plum sauce accompanied it perfectly.  Vegetables were always crisp-tender just as they should be and the meat whatever the dish was surprisingly light, a real treat when eating food that can sometimes leave you feeling like a beached whale.",

HOW do you not get general tso's right?  I got Cantonese chicken.   It was pretty much a chicken finger with the same breading as the general tso's and a gravy with no flavor. Don't waste your money.",

When I ate the food, it tasted like cigarette smoke too. I had to spit it out - the smoke had seeped into the food. After calling and asking for a refund, since I would not be eating the food, the woman who answered would not do that. It is worth the drive anywhere else to get food, never eat here.",

Their General Tso chicken was soggy and lacked any flavor. Their egg rolls tasted like smoke, cigarette as did the bar when we walked in.   I called and spoke with a lady named Jackie, explained how the food was and asked for a partial refund. She kept telling me that no smoking is permitted in the building and so what I was saying didn't make sense. I kept telling her what it tasted like and she didn't budge. She did offer 20% off my next order, but I told her we wouldn't offer again. Feel frustrating to spend $20 for food we won't continue to eat. We are bummed, we wanted to eat there and enjoy it!",

    "text": "This restaurant is a solid 3-star Chinese restaurant.  We've ordered take from here several times and recently dined in the restaurant for a second time.  They have the standard offerings that you can expect from fried rice and lo mein to General Tso's Chicken and Beef with Broccoli along with a variety of sushi offerings.    On this particular occasion, we started out by ordering the Crispy Bacon Roll (crispy bacon, avocado, & carrots in a sushi roll) and a vegetable egg roll for appetizers.  The Crispy Bacon Roll was kind of bland and an odd comb of flavors for me what with the vinegar taste from the sushi rice mixed with the bacon - it just was kind of off-putting without added lots of soy sauce and wasabi, and the vegetable egg roll was also bland and required the use of sauces to make it more palatable.    For our entrees, I ordered Szechwan Beef and my boyfriend order the General Tso's Chicken with White meat.  I asked for my dish to be extra spicy and it really was probably only at the highest a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the server never even stopped back to check on us so that I could ask for additional chili or sriracha sauce.  The General Tso's Chicken with White meat was good, but again for me, it lacked heat and was rather bland, but the chicken was crispy and well-cooked so it was good, but lacked a certain something that one usually tastes when eating General Tso's.    Overall the restaurant is clean, the service is okay, but not overwhelmingly friendly but it is fast.  The prices are reasonable and the food is decent, but not my first choice for Chinese food in Pittsburgh.",

We had a huge feast and just tried a few dishes including the shrimp fried rice, subgum chicken fried rice (To Die For), wonton soup,crab rangoon, wings(crisp and very flavorful),California sushi rolls, the duck sauce was outstanding. Service was perfect and on point plus the place itself was very cute and I would say perfect for a date or even just to hit their bar.. oh that reminds me their plum wine i's KILLER!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!   I'll be back again in the future.",

Not at all like the stir fried chicken and broccoli in a brown sauce that every other Chinese restaurant serves.  We also ordered a chicken lo mein and when we opened the container we saw that they use FETTUCCINE noodles instead of lo mein noodles and used the same weird soggy grilled chicken.  The pork egg rolls were soft and mushy and literally were dripping grease, so much so that they were inedible.  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and would rather drive all the way into the city to get what I ordered.  Please see my pictures attached of the food!",

The person working, Jackie, told me I NEEDED to call and I should NOT have ordered online because I'm so far away and it goes to her personal email. We never had problems ordering before but she had attitude. Plus, we live less than 3 miles away. She only gave me a pint instead of a quart of soup and told me she didn't charge me for the quart, which in fact she did. She continually told me I was wrong and should have ordered over the phone. I asked for a refund or for the rest of my paid for soup to be delivered. She told me she would send the soup sometime today, which meant anytime between 12:15pm to close. I told her that was ridiculous and she told me I would just have to wait because she wasn't going to make a trip to my neighborhood just for soup. She continually made me feel bad, like I was the one that messed up when in fact it was her.  I decided to drive and get my soup myself. I tried to tell her to deactivate her online account but she said no. JUST CALL!!! I tried to reason with her but she continued to be the most rude service industry person I have ever encountered.  PS The food was awful. Soggy and cold, except for the soup I went and picked up myself. It was bland but hot.",

I waited in the bar while my order was being prepared.  My order took about 15 - 20 minutes to complete which I thought was long but was not worried.  I went home, opened my meal with high expectations to see it was the wrong order.   I drove back to the restaurant they provided me my order.  I checked my order and al was well.  I was happy with the food but not crazy about  the process.  I think folks should try it - but ensure you have the right food.

They always will steam my chicken and vegetables instead of frying with tempura breading.  They also put all of my sauces on side. I try to cut back on calories and use amino acids as my sauce.  Now when I call they typically recognize my order and will even offer a healthier black rice that they have at sometimes.
