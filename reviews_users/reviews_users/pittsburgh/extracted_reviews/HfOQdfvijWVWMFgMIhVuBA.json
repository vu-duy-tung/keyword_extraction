    "text": "Tootie's is not gourmet or health food. Tootie's sells 2 types of meat - spicy Italian Beef and Sausage. You can get either on a sandwich or a mix of both. The sandwiches are very dense and meaty which makes up for the fact that a 4\" Italian Beef costs more than a Subway footlong. If you get the 12\" at Tootie's, you should also invest in a bottle of Tums.   The actual storefront is tiny - with a counter and not much more. Plan to take your sandwiches in a bag to eat in the street or at home.   As others have said, these sandwiches are a good counter-balance to the hot dogs, gyros, and pizza you can get elsewhere in the South Side. So far, I've only had the sandwiches for 2 very filling lunches, but I'm looking forward to enjoying them as late-night drunk food.   Stop in if you're hungry for a filling, juicy, beef sandwich. You won't regret it.",

Over priced, skimpy on the meat and had soggy, over cooked vegtables, apparently to make up for the shortage of meat. I'd never seen Italian Beef sandwiches in Pittsburgh before so I was excited but what a let down. Italian Beef sandwiches are popular in Chicago where it is typically a big, phat, meaty sandwich that is so good, greasy, messy, FILLING and less expensive even when I order it with hot peppers and onions. No comparison!!! Tootie should go to Portillos in Chicago and learn how to make this Chicago staple, don't skimp on the meat and make us 'Burghers some good food.",

Melts in your mouth. Then the pickled veggies and peppercini give it is crunch and a little different flavor. The beef is flavorful and the perfect texture. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. The only gripe I had was I would have liked to get a bit more of a cheese flavor. I couldn't even detect it in the sandwich. I'll ask for extra next time. Overall awesome sandwich and definitely going to be a regular in my household moving forward.",

The mac n cheese was kind of so-so, but what can help but be better with bacon? And the brownie was a very nice treat as well.

I would never have noticed it were it not for the sign pointing me to \"hot Italian beef\" on Carson.   This place basically serves three different types of meats in sandwiches: chicken, beef, and sausage. Each is rather distinct, and the flavoring for all of them is not found elsewhere. One that really struck out was the usage of rosemary in the beef--very interesting. Even more appealing was the presence of all that juice that was still present in the meat and the sandwich; even before picking it up, the juice was just leaking out.  The owner there is extremely friendly, and it's obvious that he wants his customers to be satisfied. Also offered us a sample of mac and cheese without any inquiry from us--that was really nice. And checking in on Yelp or FB throws in a soda and chips for a buck more. And the fact that some very solid food is accessible until late into the night is so convenient. Definitely returning.",

    "text": "I wish I could give two reviews for this establishment.  The Italian Beef sandwich I had was quite tasty but everything else fell short.  Below is my order with details.  Italian Beef Sandwich  $12.33   Large 8 oz.   Hot Peppers   Meat and Bread Separated for Delivery Bacon Mac and Cheese L - $7 Fat Boy Soup - $15.99 $2 delivery fee  The Italian Beef Sandwich was the only highlight of this order.  It was separated for delivery (.39 up charge is worth it based on the bread they use) and I optioned to have hot peppers.  The bun wold appear to be a typical Restaurant Depot bulk roll, nothing special.  It had a 1/8\" slice of provolone on it stuck into the bread.  I'm guessing it was Lamagna provolone.  The meat had great flavor and was enough to fill the sandwich.  I would order this again or possibly go in person to try it in-house.  4/5 stars  The Bacon Mac and Cheese was not very good.  It appeared to be just oil with melted cheese and cooked bacon.  I was not impressed with this at all and definitely not worth the $7 they charge.  2/5 stars  Concerning the Fat Boy Soup, I'm not sure where to begin.  If I had only two words to describe it I would say 'hog slop'.  It was the aforementioned oil & cheese mac and cheese with some kind of over-cooked chili layered on top of it.  Now I am sure I will get the wrath of the overly sensitive owner/manager when I say this, but it was horrid.  It was DISGUSTING.  When beef is over-cooked, it turns into a somewhat sandy substance.  The protein structure is destroyed and what you are left with is little bits and pieces of what used to be meat.  This is what their chili was like that they put on top of the mac and cheese.  Tomato, beans, sandy meat over oil and cheese macaronis.  I guess that they make this in batches and keep it on heat for hours on end, possibly mixing old with new.  I had only 3 bites then tossed it.  Maybe that's why I didn't get sick?  1/5 stars because I did not throw up or have it come immediately out the other end.",

Let me disclaim with the food is DELICIOUS. I mean that but the portion was all wrong. I ordered a half order of the fat boys soup, chili and chicken over bacon mac and cheese. While each component was delicious, the mac being my favorite....however I received much much less of it, and a little too much chili. Being in the industry myself, I have to be fair and say I maybe ordered at the wrong time. Would be willing to try again but I'm kindve disappointed.",

Yeah - that's Tootie's beef and chicken! There is so much flavor infused into it that you don't need anything else on the sandwich besides the cheese and pickled vegetables.   Their chili is also fantastic. It's very different from your typical red-sauce chili as Tootie's is more like a thick, hearty soup loaded with meat, beans, veggies, nestled on top of a cornbread \"pancake\" and topped with a cornbread \"pancake\". A must-try!  Feeling non-committal? No problem, Tooties gives free samples!",

There meats on there sandwiches are very fresh and the seasoning and flavor is unique and A+ and what really makes your purchase worth the money. I guess the only very small gripe is you wind up spending around 20 bucks for a combo if you order delivery after you calculate in the delivery charge and tip. Which might be a little pricey for some folks factoring it is a meal just for one. But all in all i have enjoyed all my meals and will continue to order from this establishment the future",

    "text": "I didn't come to Tootie's Saturday night to have some grub prior to a rendezvous with Orange Goblin and Holy Grail at the Rex Theater.   Oh, food was had, namely, The Barnyard, a whammy of a sandwich that consists of shredded, slow-cooked Italian beef with chicken (also slow-cooked and shredded), provolone, diced grilled onions, diced caramelized green peppers, and a link of hot (haute?) sausage inside a luxuriously pillowy, custom-baked 6 inch hoagie roll. The innards are so generously packed inside the cut of spongy bread, a fork is provided for your convenience so that not one iota of this Midwest import can be excusably discarded.   No, I came to chat with Karl, the Chicago transplant who brazenly decided to move to Pittsburgh and bring with him to the South Side something most of us here have only seen Guy Fieri devour on television. While I munched on an egregiously toothsome hero in this closet of an eatery (luckily, the one small table in the place was unoccupied), we discussed food, bands, relationships, women, film -- we became friends. Making things especially cordial was the complimentary thimble of turkey chili Karl presented me with to gauge my opinion. \"Man, I'm not even nutters over turkey, but I dig this,\" I said to him as he slowly nodded his head while smiling like a DJ who had found his groove.  So yes, Italian Beef is a grand, gorgeous, splendid thing and not at all redundant. Eating it had me full of regret over not having traveled or lived enough. That must change. In the meantime, I have Mr. Horn to thank and his supple, humid, supremely edible grinders to serve as a reminder that Chi-Town awaits me patiently with the porchlight on and an empty seat at the table.",

The meat was on the bland side and the steamed vegetable didn't really spice things up much. I got bored after the first few bites. Maybe I didn't try the right thing.

Though Tootie's is tucked pretty inconspicuously half a block down a side street, wind carries the aroma pretty far into E. Carson.   We were across the street at Local and when we left, the smell made me so hungry all of a sudden. I HAD to have this, but if my school campus has taught me anything, it's that this smell could come from anywhere... whatever it was. My friend was brilliant enough to ask the doorman. He pointed across the street and told us to get chicken and beef.  THANK YOU MR. DOORMAN. He must get paid to direct people here or just really love this place. I mean, how can you not?   I was actually stuffed from dinner despite being fooled by the delicious scent, so we split the chicken and beef between the 3 of us. It was not cheap though. Almost $9.50 for a 6 inch. But it definitely made up for it in the flavor compartment. Also love that it wasn't just saturated with saltiness. Worth it? Maybe not $10 for a 6 inch. Some of the other items seem a bit cheaper. Ask for extra giardiniera, imo. Theirs is not spicy or acidic enough.   The owner's a real chill guy. I'd be happy to support his business again and again. They are open late, so if you've got drunk munchies in the south side, come here instead of pizza (sorry Sal's).  It's goooood.   NOTE: SMALL. 1 table, 3 seats, barely standing room.",

I would add an additional gold feather in their cap, because they even followed the delivery instructions I added to the order to a T!   Now, you might be curious as to why all of this good food and great service only elicited a four star review. Andrew Jackson is the reason for that.

Casually known to my visitors as a place of despair, consistently lame weather, and awful sports fans, I take pride in hearing the variations of \"Holy wow, I never realized Pittsburgh was so awesome\" at the end of visits.  And so, in my quest to spot out everything worth it in Pittsburgh, I stumble in to Tootie's on a Saturday afternoon. Greeted by the owner, he initiates friendly conversation before telling us that this is his mother's beef recipe straight from Chicago. I go ahead and order the smallest option, not expecting too much.  Biting into the sandwich was kind of like that part in the Wizard of Oz where all of a sudden everything bursts into vibrant color. Notice that the menu has one option: beef sandwich. Yeah, you can get a sausage, but that's just a small filler on the bottom of the delicious beef sandwich. If you really want (and I am wont to really want), you can add provolone, green pepper, onions, or even marinara sauce (they call it the Benny, named for the guy who runs the Rex and goes wild for the combination of marinara/onion/green pepper).   Tootie's is the perfect addition to my Pittsburgh tour. Convenient location, open late, friendly atmosphere, and unbelievable sandwich. Ask for it dipped. You're welcome.",

I ordered 3 so I can share with the critics back at the house. After a 15 minute drive home I tore into this gorgeous,  stacked, steak sandwich piled high with Italian beef and topped with the spiced garden mix and WOW! I think the home crowd may have to get there own! Will be back for sure!",

    "text": "I frequent the Southside a lot. So I was surprised to find out that this sandwich shop has been there for 2 years and I had never heard if it or noticed it. We tried it for lunch today and really liked it.  We realized that we actually had seen cars with their logo on top. It seems that most of their business is delivery. The place is tiny and there is one table to sit at that seats two. We sat at the table to eat. We talked to a couple of employees and they are all nice.  We ordered a 6 inch chicken sandwich, 6 inch beef sandwich, side of chili, and a side of Mac and Cheese. The chicken was incredibly moist. It is cooked for hours and shredded. It is placed on a bun with a small mixture of carrots, cauliflower, and banana peppers. They are pickled so it brings a sour note and a crunch to the sandwich. Very good. The beef is just as good as the beef. There are other types of sandwiches to choose from also. The chili was a little thin even though it had beans and ground beef. It could have used more chili powder in my opinion. It's topped with grated cheese which is a nice touch. The Mac and Cheese was my husband's favorite. It is she'll shaped noodles with a creamy cheese sauce and a bit of bacon thrown in. You can even get it on your sandwich.  It's a little place with BIG taste.",

    "text": "When all I can say is wow I think that I might need a sixth star. This place was great.   Tooties is located on 16th right off of Carson so as far as location goes it couldn't get much better. The place is slightly bigger than a mouse hole. There is space for the hot line, counter, a cooler and a single table with 3 stools. It's definitely geared toward takeout and delivery. But the space is warm and clean so I like it.   The service is awesome too. I stopped in around 10 on a Thursday and the only one there was the owner. He was incredibly friendly and had samples for is without even being asked. Big points in my book. Getting our stuff after ordering took a little while but that was due to the fact that he had to make some of the thing we ordered from scratch. I am more than ok with this. It's nice to see a business put care and effort into their food and I will never complain about waiting for fresh cooked product.   Now for the main event: the food. For me great food starts with a great aroma and the scent of slow roasted beef pervades Tooties. Your mouth starts watering as soon as you walk in. The sandwiches are awesome enough to backup the aromatic promise to boot. The beef is succulent and juicy. The bread is soft and chewy and soaks up all the juice. The giardinera is crunchy and tangy and the sandwich as a whole leaves a wonderful spicy sting on the lips for the better part of 20 minutes. I would also suggest the Mac and cheese. It is cheesy and creamy and awesome. They do use bacon in their Mac and cheese which is almost cliched nowadays but come on, bacon.   All in all I loved Tooties. I can't wait to go back. They make a Chicago staple that I feel is a welcome companion to our beloved Primanti's in the late night sandwich pantheon.",

The food was good, but my knock is how expensive this place is. The \"Large\" sandwich was only a 6 inch sub roll. I guess I am just accustomed to a large being at least a 12 inch. I paid a total of $20.53. That included a delivery charge of $2.00 and a $3.50 tip. The food itself would have been a little over $15.00, if I would have went in, which I still think is expensive. I do not mind paying that much for dinner delivery at all when I am on the road, but not for a 6 inch sandwich.....",

Let me tell you this may be the best tasting sandwich I have ever eaten. I'm kicking myself for not getting a second one to take with me only because I live about 35 minutes away.

The roast beef is delicious and the pickled veggies really add a lot to the sandwich.  The mac and cheese is even better than I anticipated. Isn't all mac and cheese delicious? Not. Like. This. Absolutely delicious and soooo flavorful.   Another key point is that they deliver to us! We live in Brookline and they deliver all the way over here which is extremely awesome!!!!   The two reasons I had to take away a star (sigh..) is because 1) we put a note on our order for GrubHub to have the meat separated from the bread just so it wasn't soggy on the ride here. That did not happen, although we can possibly blame GrubHub (not sure how the ordering system works) Luckily, the bread truly did not sacrifice too much. It wasn't a big deal. BUT we also did not get the two brownies we ordered. Also not a HUGE deal except I was really looking forward to it and especially being pregnant, I wanted that brownie. ;)  All in all, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and order form this place. You will not regret it. That was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. We are very very impressed and plan to spread the word! I'm already dreaming of my next Italian beef sandwich......  Update: changed to five stars for amazing service. They definitely made it right and it was completely unexpected. Also, brownies are delicious, too!",

I got my food, I had only ordered a 6inch Italian beef but the bag also had a container of mac and cheese!! It had bacon and it was actually really good. Pleasantly surprised.  As for the sandwich, the bread was super soggy but honestly I should've expected that as my meal was delivered and the beef is basically soaked in broth. I like my meat soaked in broth though so it's good. Probably would've been better on a harder roll, but I'm not sure if Italian beef is traditionally on a soft roll so I won't complain too much. Tooooons of beef on the bun, as well as some veggies. The veggies are why this didn't get a 5 star review, mainly because they seemed frozen or something. Also I'm not a fan of celery or peppers but I can easily pick those off.   So, not sure I'll order delivery again because of the soggy bread but if I'm near the brick and mortar location I'll drop by!",

I was really interested in trying Tootie's, as many delivery places around Oakland are the same generic pizzerias with very similar menus.  I was very interested in their combo, as it is a pretty good deal and comes with a lot of food.  First, I got the chili. It was a little small of a portion, so I have to believe that it wasn't the same size as the regular side chili not part of the combo. It was tasty, not too spicy, and had a pretty delicious cornbread/pancake (which took up half of the dish).  As my sandwich, I got the Mac on a chick. This is where my preface of delivery comes into play. The chicken was very delicious and the roll was amazingly soft, but the Mac and cheese was dry and just tasted like noodles, but again, probably because of the delivery.  The best part of the meal was the brownie. I wasn't expecting much from a brownie from a delivery place, but it was the softest, most chocolatey brownie I've ever eaten.  I would definitely like to go to Tootie's and eat it fresh, although I've seen other reviews that it's a small place. Nonetheless, it was quite refreshing and a good change of pace from Oakland eateries.",

I had a chicken/beef combo sandwich and I could barely finish the whole thing! It is PACKED with meat and provolone cheese and topped with pickled veggies. The meat was and SO tender and clearly slow-cooked with some love. They also have sausage and the option to put Mac & Cheese on any sandwich. I was quite disappointed the Mac & Cheese had bacon in it since I don't eat pork, but I imagine that will be good news for many others.  The place is SMALL, so it is not ideal for groups and honestly is best for take-out because there is only one small table that could fit 2, maybe 3 comfortably. The gentleman serving us was very friendly and nice to chat with!   Please never go to Primanti again and eat here instead. You'll get a much better bang for your buck!",

    "text": "Why have I waited so long to try this place?!  One rare night while partaking in some Carson Street livations I walk by Tootie's and noticed the short line out the door. I though of some of the Yelp reviews of the place and decided to give it a try.  Once inside I realized that it was pretty much a take out shop as there really isn't anywhere to sit other than one small table which was already taken. If you can't decide which meat to get you can ask for a free sample to help make up your mind.  Your choices are four different types of sandwiches:  Famous Italian Beef (Slow-Roasted, Shredded, Seasoned Beef) available in 4, 6 or 12\" sizes.   Hot Sausage (Uncle Charley's gourmet hot sausage) on a 6\" hoagie bun.  Tooties Famous Chicken (Slow-Roasted, Shredded, Seasoned Chicken) also available in 4, 6 or 12\" sizes.   Specialty Sandwiches which are a combination of two or more meats, available in 6 or 12\" sizes.  Since the place is called Tootie's Famous Italian Beef, that's what I decided to go with. I went with the 6\" Juicy Italian Beef hoagie filled with Italian Beef, Giardiniera, and Provolone Cheese. I flew home to eat it as the smell was intoxicating. Let me just say that it was not only the best Italian Beef sandwich I have ever had but, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had period!  Tootie's Famous Italian Beef is a great sandwich to help you sober up after a night of bar hopping on Carson Street and is something different than going to Primanti's which everyone does.   I highly recommend this place. Five stars!",

I now want to figure out how to pickle stuff just for these purposes. This place is tucked away and I feel like everyone should know about it. My boyfriend loves their Mac and cheese. I didn't have a chance to try it but being that he doesn't love Mac and cheese that's a compliment.",

The juice had no flavor as well so getting it dipped did not help anything but the staleness. The beef was a shredded pot roast instead of thinly sliced beef. The hot peppers were too big and not very spicy; they also had the wrong taste. Do not go to this place for a beef sandwich if you are expecting Chicago style beef. Any restaurant in Chicago with a beef on their menu blows this sandwich out of the water. Maybe their other sandwiches are good but if that's the case I recommend a name change.",

All it is is a counter where you get food from. Home style, local cooking. Foodies should definitely give it a try.   We tried the Italian beef, shredded chicken, bacon Mac and cheese and chili. Everything was wonderful. Half of us thought the pulled chicken was the best while others thought the Italian beef but everyone had nothing bad to say about anything. You won't regret giving this a try!",

My opinion is that the flavor, quality, and cut of meat that was used to make the sandwich was off. I feel that the sandwich was not great nor was it \"Italian beef\" by my definition. The sandwich was a made on good bread, but the meat was more a roast beef cooked in a style to be pulled. And the peppers were enormous and lacked in any flavor. All in all I would not go here again. But I will say perhaps this is Pittsburgh style Italian beef.",

That's when I decided to try Tootie's, which was a tough decision when Pittsburgh has so many 4.5-5 star restaurants. My experience can be summarized by saying Tootie's 4 star rating is underrated. I ordered a 4oz Italian beef sandwich and a side of Bacon Mac & Cheese. The Italian beef was juicy, spicy and delicious. I love how the bun soaked up all the flavor. The pickled veggies on top added a crispness and bite to the sandwich, which I loved. The polish guy working when I went was great, he struck up a great conversation. I wish we had a Tootie's in Rochester, NY. I hope one day I'll be able to return.",

My bartender introduced this place to me shortly after it opened...and we haven't stopped eating here since. Dude is friendly as heck and I can't say anything bad about food or service.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best sandwichs in Pittsburgh!! They have one flaw and that's pricing. The South Side of Pittsburgh has it share of ritzy comers and goers but consits a lot of poor college students and senior citizens who will often think twice about paying $15 for a footlong sandwhich. The prices are reasonable when you consider that it's just starting up but if they can chef up the 12'' for $7-8 in the future business will boom!",
