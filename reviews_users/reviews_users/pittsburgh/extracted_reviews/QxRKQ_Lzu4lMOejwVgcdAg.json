We ordered the fried zucchini  appetizer and was very disappointed when the plate arrived with 4 tiny strips.  The rest of our food came quickly and was just ok.  Probably won't return because of the disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Though NPL boasts an extensive menu with lots of good choices, I'm awarding a fourth star for one appetizer (which might as well be an entree): the delicious, creative, and well-executed BBQ Chicken Ranch Dip.  A multi-cheese blend is swirled with barbecue sauce and a hint of ranch dressing, topped with a generous helping of chicken chunks, and served next to a basket of tortilla chips with which to scoop the gooey and hearty symphony of salt, meat and cheese.  I haven't had the chance to explore a significant number of the offerings, but I suspect there are a few other gems scattered throughout the less impressive options--which are still not bad.",

The place is full of regulars who arrive an hour early , at least, just to get a seat at the bar and they know each other so they are watching and waiting for seats to open. It is a great crew,  a family really,  and fun if you can be so lucky to be a guest with a regular. Go anyway, but be ready to wait regardless,  it's busy and delicious!",

    "text": "NPL is a great restaurant and I go there weekly.  The good: - Tons of appetizer choices for sports bar food. Wings, Pretzels, Big fries with cheese/bacon, nachos that are good but will make you poop green, onion rings and other things. - I love their burgers. My mom hates them but I really enjoy them. - I don't eat much fish but everyone loves their big fish sandwich. - You will have something to take home, especially if you have an appetizer. - The walking manager is really a great guy. He is the heart of NPL.  The bad: - The bus boys are like hawks preying on little birds when there are empty plates or glasses around. They watch and wait and glance at you multiple times, begging you to finish. It gets annoying. - They have TV's at all the booths, however, the TV's have maybe 6-7 channels. 1 is some kind of poker game, 1 always has no audio and if there is a Pittsburgh sports game on, it will be on multiple channels, meaning you get maybe 3 different channels to choose from.  - They have new booths and there is one by the door that is only meant for people under 150lbs. It was the first booth I couldn't fit in ever in my life.  TIPS: - They take a long time to make burgers and other meats. - They \"stagger\" food and appetizers. This means that after you order an appetizer, they will wait however long they feel to put in the order. Tell them not to \"stagger it\" and you will be out of there A LOT quicker.",

Other than the bar tenders that are always wonderful. The waitress and waiter the past couple of times have been very rude to my group feeling rushed out the door. I don't want my check when I'm planning to stay and drink for the night why hire a Dj if your going to rush me out the door? Let me tell you when I'm ready. Then when things are brought to the table they have been basically tossed onto the table other than your plate of food. You have to wave them down to get a refill on your drink.

One thing is in Pittsburgh you always get fries on a dinner salad! That was something unique to here. The restaurant was very cold inside. There was 10 of us and they automatically added gratuity but the severs were still very attentive. I got a burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was good but the fries were not great they tasted like regular fries that were colored Orange...Very bland. They have huge fish sandwiches and my uncle ordered pizza. It looked lack luster as well. Like a kids pizza not cheesy at all. It's a good place to come for familiar food. Nothing special but still good. It was very busy and it's one of those restaurants everyone congregates at in the suburbs on a Friday night because there is nothing else to do. By the way the dessert options suck. We would have ordered one but they were weird. Like who doesn't have a brownie with ice cream...cheesecake...etc they had apple tart and some French thing trying to be like an upscale restaurant lol um no.",

Get the Lounge Fries (maybe with a side of Lipitor??) because they're fried, cheesy glorious-ness.  They are a must have at NPL.  As far as entrees go, I have many favorites.  The Black and Blue cheeseburger is delicious with caramelized onions and bleu cheese on a 1/2 lb quality patty of beef.  The Italian hoagie has the perfect ratio of toasted crustiness to softness of the bread.  The meat isn't that mystery meat you get at other places but lean, flavorful Italian meats.  The French Onion soup is served in a generous crock with an even more generous portion of cheese melted and gooey on top. So good on a fall or winter day.  The salads are huge.  The steak salad is one of my favorites in the area and is served \"Pittsburgh-style\" with French fries on it (of course!).  The servers are friendly and many of them have been there for years.  Always quick to refill your drink or give you a recommendation if you can't decide what to order.  There are a TON of TVs, so definitely a great place to catch a game.  They have lots of events and contests that go on (Karaoke, Trivia night, etc.) so something to check out when you're there.",

I went with with a group of 3 adults, 2 teenagers and a child  Our drink order was also quickly taken.   We started off with lounge fries and fried cheese The lounge fries were a meal in themselves and super delicious. The fries cheese was also very good.  Between us we ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, 2 taco salads, child's pizza, pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese and an order of chicken tenders.   Everything was delicious. They accidentally made my chicken wrap plain grilled without buffalo sauce...but I'm not one to fuss even though the waitress offered to fix it for me. I just had her bring me a side of buffalo sauce and all was well.  The taco salads are huge and come in a tortilla she'll as the bowl.  After we ate the youngins took off to the arcade where they played games and won tickets to exchange for prizes.  We were there for about 2 hours and most of that time was hanging out and waiting on the kids as it was not a busy time.   Our waitress was fantastic and on top of keeping our drinks filled and checking in on us.   I would recommend this place to anyone and will go back to try other things on the menu.",

My boo and I stopped in for lunch and sat ourselves, but didn't realize the table was dirty till we sat. A lady came over to wipe it and did not acknowledge our existence whatsoever ... Super awkward and she looked miserable as all hell. Lucky this woman was not our server. We were greeted shortly after and from that point the service was very commendable. My boo got the giant fish sandwich and as you see in the photos, it lived up to its namesake. I got the BBQ chicken appetizer dip as my meal because I had t before at the cranberry location and it was fantastic... This time tho it was not as delicious. Also I asked for flatbread with it instead of chips and was told it was a $1 upcharge. That didn't make sense to me because the spinach artichoke dip comes with the flatbread and it's the same price... But whatever. Chips were stale and I ended up getting the flatbread anyway which was very good. Overall a pleasant lunch experience for the most part .",

Me and my family visited the restaurant on September 5.  We were greeted by two younger girls that were accommodating when we asked to be switched from one seating area to another.  Things stated off ok.    We ordered all of our meals (5) and asked for the \"lounge fries\" as our appetizer.  The came fairly quickly and looked good, but once we ate a few we all noticed a stinky dish rag smell to the fries.  They also had a nasty taste to them.  Then we get our meals and two of us ordered the grilled chicken wrap with mild wing sauce on the side.   The wing sauce was just so bad; it was literally a droplet of Franks Hot Sauce and the rest was grease!!!  We asked the manager about it and he said that was exactly what it is and that is the way they make their mild wing sauce!  We have made a decision not to visit this place any more based on our last 5 visits it so.",

Even though it was a cold night, we were sat on the patio.  It was nice because they had a fire place and heaters and the patio is less crowded and cramped than the seats inside.    The wait staff was ok, but i was not overly impressed.  It is tough to judge on only one visit, but I don't like to have an empty drink cup for as long as we had.  The food was above average bar food.  We ended up ordering the Lounge fries and the giant fish sandwich with a side of onion rings.  The cheese sauce on the fries was delicious and much better than the neon orange cheese sauce you get at a lot of other places.  The fish was cod and was pretty good but a little greasy.  Overall, we did not leave hungry and I would order everything we did again.",

Wings are on the pricey side at $6.49 for 5 or $10.99 for 10, but this can be easily avoided by ordering the pizza (which is actually pretty good) and wings which comes with two decent sized one topping slices and 5 wings for $8.99.  Best homemade ranch dressing ever!  It's a really decent deal when combined with a $2.50 Coors light on NFL game day.  I also had the munchies platter for $12.99 which was probably almost enough for three people.  Is the food the best, probably not, but hey, it's a bar, they have the NFL ticket and cheap beer, so what more could I asked for beside some good old bar grub?  Looks like their sit down dinners are pretty decent too, but haven't had them yet.  Portion sizes are very favorable. Place is usually busy but it is big enough where space is not an issue. Oh, and FREE POPCORN at the Hostess stand.  Updated: I love this restaurant, why not give it five stars!  A few imperfections can't slight the fact that it is always a wonderful time.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about North Park Lounge (NPL).  So far my guy and I have come here twice, once for a Friday evening dinner in February and once for a Tuesday evening dinner back in March.  On both occasions my burger and sweet potato fries were solid, but other aspects of this place have left me feeling as though NPL isn't quite the place for me.  NPL was packed during our Friday night experience, and I don't doubt that's the case most Friday nights.  The wait wasn't so bad, though standing around near the bathrooms and claw machine wasn't an ideal waiting scenario.  During our wait we got a good look at the clientele situation, which is basically everyone--college kids looking to let loose, middle-agers equally letting loose, families, couples.  I noticed at least 2 toddlers in attendance, which was odd to me being that NPL seems to be just as focused on the bar/lounge aspect of the establishment as it is on the food and that most customers appeared to be enjoying more than a couple adult beverages.  Anyway, NPL seems to be a place where everyone is welcome.  During that first dinner Husband's fish sandwich was terrible--very bready with just a thin, dry fish fillet.  A shame for a region that boasts some pretty amazing big fried fish sandwiches.  (In case you're interested, I think the best fish sandwich is at no-frills Harry's Place off Route 51, about 30 minutes away.)  My burger, on the other hand, was solid.  It was cooked close to the medium-rare I had specified, and the seasoning was in-your-face but not totally overwhelming.  The sweet potato fries, which I order often at various establishments, were very good.  The White Russian I had with my dinner was the worst I've ever had.  More on NPL's White Russian in the next paragraph.  During our second dinner at NPL we kept if safe and ordered burgers.  Our waitress that day wasn't particularly pleasant, but because she was chatty I did take the opportunity to ask her about the White Russian before ordering one.  She explained that at the bar the beverage gun has a button specifically for White Russians.  In other words, the bartender pushes a button and White Russian spurts into the glass, no mixing necessary.  Needless to say my Tuesday night White Russian was just as bad as the Friday night White Russian.  Funny how some bars employ \"mixologists\" who are so into preparing pricey handcrafted cocktails with a hundred ingredients, and other bars have guns that not only measure the alcohol but that actually go a step further and mix the drink.  The dichotomy of bartending!  I prefer a happy middle ground.  I like that I can come here for a decent burger; however, I can't currently justify giving North Park Lounge more than 3 stars.",

Both wife and I picked the \"small\" fried cod fish sandwich. It was great. A thick piece of flakey cod fried to perfection. So big it stuck outside the big bun about 1inch on both sides. I can't imagine the size of the large sandwich. Actually, my wife and I could have split one sandwich and been satisfied.   Sandwich came with an over abundance of French fries and a tasty dish of Cole slaw. Service was most friendly and meal was served most promptly. We would both order the fish sandwich again at the NPL. There were many other interesting options. Place was very busy and TV's filled the walls. Will return when in town.",

    "text": "The North Park lounge will not blow your mind, but it's consistent and decent food.  The general vibe is a neighborhood bar feeling, similar cliental to an Applebee's.  But I'd rather service a local establishment.  There are tvs everywhere, which is slightly distracting.  I've never had great service here, but it's typically at least acceptable.  I usually order the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it still packs a punch.  Otherwise, I wouldn't get anything exotic here, but the standard menu fare is just fine.  My only complaint is you cannot really eat \"healthy\" here if you so chose.  The portions are outrageous, and everything comes with French Fries.  Would a fruit side without an up charge kill anyone?",

I recall the menu stating beer-battered but this hard piece of fish was breaded which gave an entirely different taste. I would have given 2 stars but the waitress was super nice and friendly which amped the rating. Draft beer was not very cold. Will likely not be returning to NPL for a long time.",

    "text": "North Park Lounge is close to home for us, so its always a good option for a dinner out when we dont want to drive outside the neighborhood.   At this North Hills location there is often a fairly long wait on weekends, but of course you can grab a drink from the bar while you wait -which makes the wait not so bad. I have never had unfriendly or bad service here and the food is always solid, although it is also fairly average. However, I have never had anything come out cold or not the way I wanted it. Their french onion soup is AMAZING and the lounge fried and burgers are really good - juicy, hot and never dry. They are always a winner.   Other menu items like their salads and other non-burger sandwiches are just OK and slightly underwhelming...Ive had the grilled chicken salad with the fries and the buffalo chicken salad- they are just average for me - Its usually just a lot of lettuce with few toppings (chicken included) - I like a lot of \"stuff\" in my salads and if I am eating a large dinner salad out, I want it to have a good lettuce to \"stuff\" ratio, which these often don't. But this is just a personal preference.   I'm not from the North Hills, nor am I from Pittsburgh originally. I find that those who grew up in the area are pretty loyal to this place and it almost has a cult-like following for them. As an outsider, its just a pretty average neighborhood place to get a burger and a beer. Still wont stop us from heading back for dinner in the area, or if the mood strikes for a crock of french onion soup close to home.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to dinner at NPL on a Thursday evening, and it was unbelievably packed! Little did we know that their special was \"Taco Thursday\" with additional Mexican dishes on the menu. Also, there was as Steelers preseason game on that will help draw a crowd.   To my surprise, we did not have to wait to be seated. The walkways between tables are very narrow and make it  difficult to pass guests/employees if you must pass them by. I like the variety of food that NPL has to offer. Anything from sandwiches, salads, and burgers, to pasta dishes, pizza, and wings. With so many options, it was hard to decide! We settled on the cheese stuffed pretzel for an appetizer - now, I expected this item to be a soft pretzel filled with cheese. Nope! It was one of the pretzel rolls that they use for the sandwiches with slices of cheese melted in between. I was not impressed, however, it tasted ok especially when dipped in honey mustard. For my dinner, I ordered the 6\" hot Italian sandwich  with a side of sweet potato fries. I was pleasantly surprised! The sandwich was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed the fries although they didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce (and I wasn't going to dip them in ketchup) which was a slight disappointment. My meal was very filling and I was able to take half of the sandwich home to have at a later date.   I'll give props to this place for the atmosphere they have developed: a popcorn machine filled to the top with freshly made buttered popcorn, a spinning wheel for entertainment, and TV's everywhere to watch any game. Of course, they have an extensive list of beverages for you to enjoy as well. A screened in porch provides an opportunity to sit outside when the weather is nice.  Every staff member we encountered was very attentive and nice.   Overall, my experience was satisfying. Decent food, reasonably priced, friendly staff, and a lot events/specials going on at all times. We will probably be back for some football this fall.",

It's the type of place where you can walk in for the first time and feel like a regular. They have all kinds of fun specials like a birthday wheel, trivia night, name that tune, and much more. They even have TVs at a lot of the booths so if you can get a seat at the bar to see the game, you don't have to worry. I really can't speak highly enough about this place.

I sat for almost 10 minutes without even eye contact from the bartender. He was talking with all the regulars, getting them drinks or just standing there. After a few minutes I did look at my watch just to see how long it would take and it was just about 7 minutes. He got my drink order, took a few minutes to make it because he stopped to talk to other people. Finally made the drink, it was fine, then started to walk away. I had to ask for a menu and then wait about 6 more minutes until he came back to get my order. The kitchen brought the food (flatbread) out fast and it was really tasty. At no point did the bartender come to see if I wanted another drink or needed anything else. I had to force eye contact to get my bill. I recommend the food but sit at a table so you don't interrupt the bartender's social hour and make him work.",

I ordered the Colossal Fish w onion rings, my son ordered the Chicken Flatbread, other son ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and my wive ordered the Cuban.  The fish could feed 2 people, the flatbread was delicious and the quesadilla was gone before I had a chance for a bite.  The Cuban was the only problem.  It came out w a full plate of fries but the sandwich was very 'wet'. Not sure if it was butter or what from putting it on the griddle but even after sipping it up w a napkin- it wasn't very appealing.  The inside filling looked great but the wet bread kinda ruined it.  Watching all the other delicious foods coming out of the Kitchen ensured we'll be back and I'll be the one to select my wife's meal.",

I heard this was the place for fish, so I went with the broiled cod cooked with fresh orange slices and side of broccoli. The dish was simple and tasty, and I left feeling very satisfied with my meal. The spinach artichoke dip is also a great item to share. Overall, you are coming here for ambiance that is lively yet relaxing at the same time.",

I've had an hour and a half wait here and I am still giving them 4 stars, because the food is that good.  This is my favorite location (although I have never been to the Cranberry location) and I am always happy with my food. The cajun steak pasta is probably my favorite meal, ever. I get it almost every time. It comes with a huge side of garlic rolls that I can share with my entire family.  The lounge fries are also something you should get every once in a while. Gigantic and delicious.   The bar is always, always crowded. I probably wouldn't give it five stars for that part of the restaurant, because I can see it being nearly impossible to get a drink.",

    "text": "I've been to the North Park Lounge in the past, but not at this location. The one I've been to before had games, and a totally different atmosphere. It wasn't until my boyfriend and I came here for my birthday this past week that we realized this one didn't have games, a little disappointing, but we got over it, it was our own faults for not googling it before coming here. This place was well decorated inside, it was all done up for Halloween and it was pretty cool. I did not like how crammed you felt in here though. Unless you sat at your own booth you're basically sitting side by side other people at other tables, and really can't have your own conversations.  Compared to the previous time I've gone here, the menu seemed different. I believe when I went years ago, I had some sort of Parmesan crusted chicken and pasta, but didn't see anything like that on this menu. We started off our meal with an order of their mozzarella bites. Which were truly fantastic. They came with a sauce that was phenomenal. My boyfriend ordered a 14inch pepperoni pizza, and it was god awful. I took two bites of it and didn't like it whatsoever. He did like it however. (Maybe it's just me?) Luckily, I ordered my own meal, which was a big juicy cheeseburger and fries. My burger was perfect, and the fries were so good. Since him and I are such gluttons, we also ordered the pepperoni roll, which came stuffed with cheese, pepperoni, and banana peppers. It was okay, nothing to brag over. There was next to no banana peppers in it, and it was 95% cheese and like 5% dough. The bread to cheese ratio was super off to me.  Overall the experience was okay. The food wasn't anything to brag over, the environment made me sort of claustrophobic. Our server was very friendly and attentive however, we definitely tipped her well for being so respectful and nice on a busy Saturday evening. My honest opinion is that I'd only come here if invited by someone and definitely not by choice, but maybe to one that has games. But more for the games than the food.",

The inside is kind of setup like a dive bar, but there are plenty of seats away from the actual bar area.    For an appetizer we had the barbecue chicken ranch dip.  I am a huge fan of buffalo chicken dip so I figured I'd give this a try.  It was delicious.  The bbq sauce had a great tangy taste.  The chips were not the best and I think flatbread or pita would go better with the dip, but I still really enjoyed it.  For my meal I had the A1 burger, which I ordered medium rare.  It came out closer to medium, but was still juicy.  It was an above average burger, but did not live up to the \"best in the burgh\" claim on their website and menu.  The meat blends just didn't seem to be a great combination, too lean a ratio possibly.  Like I said though it was juicy and had some good flavor.  The fries were your standard bar fries, they would have been just ok, but the quality ranch dressing they had made them a good side.  My wife had a chicken quesadilla which was delicious.  I definitely want to return to try some of the other things on their menu.  Great first trip though.",

The name didn't spark confidence and we feared the worst from looking up Yelp reviews but overall was not too terrible.  Our waitress was forgetful...we watched her take our beer to the opposite side of the room before bringing it back to our table for instance.  The fried zucchini appetizer was good...thick slices breaded & topped with parmesean cheese. For me it was the highlight of the evening.  Hubby had a burger that he was satisfied with. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The chicken had a nice char but needed seasoning.  They had a good selection of draft beer so we ordered. Both glasses arrived with no head. Very disappointing.   Family ordered crab cakes and they looked full of crab meat. He also ordered risotto which I did taste...it was rubbish don't waste your money. Another ordered fried chicken strips which she enjoyed.  Overall, I was fed but I don't see us returning.",

    "text": "NPL is very close to home and I have come here with my family for a quick dinner or to meet the girls for a drink and some appetizers. The food is typical bar food, fair to middlin' in taste and quality. The service has gotten worse and worse and today had to be the worst of the worst. We waited for over 5 minutes to place our order although we expressed that we were ready when we sat down. The sliders were overcooked and the buns were burnt. The soup we ordered was runny, oily and although it was wedding soup, it only had three pebble sized meatballs. To top off the visit, the server placed dirty dishes from another table on our table when we were getting ready to leave. Having been a server and bartender in the past, I would NEVER think to leave dirty dishes on a table, especially dishes from another table. Unbelievable.",

This place has an extensive menu (including lounge fries), access to every game through one of it's plethora of TVs, a decent sized bar, and a wheel of prizes that you get to spin on your birthday.  What more can you ask for?  The downside is the occasionally long wait.  not many other options in the area and you can tell.",

    "text": "I used to come here occasionally and like the wings and the sandwiches. The last three times have been progressively worse over the last year. The pasta overcooked, the sauce thick and tasteless, the salad rife with old refrigerator - you know what I mean, the wings and fish and french fries as if they came straight from the SYSCO truck and then to the freezer then to the fryer. If you don't know what I mean then by all means keep eating here. Clearly the food does not deter the masses who pack this place and Olive Garden etc. I'm sure the bar is a good time. It is too bad that even a local small chain has let the food go like this. I imagine they are resting on their reputation. The service is friendly and the outside patio is nice but I will not return because of the food.",

    "text": "After two subsequent visits we are giving this place thumbs down. Their steak sandwich' is nothing more than steak ums, piled with french fries (Pramanti's rip off), and lousy tasting overall. And for close to $9? I don't think so. 2nd visit: 'giant fish' sandwich had absolutely no flavor! Guiness beer on tap special was watered down. Wife had steak salad with wilty lettuce. Wrote to them and they told me nitrogen valve on the keg tap was faulty...maybe so but don't they taste test their tapped beer every day??? Seems like this should have been a protocol. Overall...so-so to lousy food, lack of quality control beers, noisy, crowded, and terrible to find parking. Never more.",

    "text": "I have been going to the Lounge for years with my family and it is always a place we take out of area visitors to.  Like stated before, it's a 'Cheers' type place, but almost leans towards a TGI Friday's type place, but with a friendlier staff.  The service has always been quick and prompt and the staff is friendly and treats you respectably. Any requests are normally handled without and issue. Quite often the owner, Mark, will stop by your table to either ask how things are going or even deliver your food. Its definitely a quality I like to see in a restaurant when the owner is so involved in his investment and is there to ensure that everyone is enjoying themselves.  As for the food, I doubt theres much, if anything that is not good to order. I have tried a range of their food from the Lounge fries, cheese steaks, burgers, fish sandwiches, and wraps, and have never been disappointed. Now I'm not a huge salad fan because I love sinking my teeth into some type of meat, my mother and sister always enjoy them and rarely order anything else.  There beer specials are also quite good and for a first timer, I'd suggest getting some Lounge Fries (Cheese and Bacon with Ranch dressing) along with a beer and the Giant Fish sandwich. *drool*",

    "text": "The NPL is a \"Cheers\"  type of bar/restaurant. A lot of the patrons appear to be regulars, judging by how often I hear a waitress greet a party with a Pittsburghese \"How ya doin', hon?\" They have an extensive menu with many of the expected items such as a giant fish sandwich (and I mean GIANT), hoagies and burgers, as well as a good number of full entrees featuring chicken, steak and pasta.   The walls are decorated with large pictures of golden age movie stars and Pittsburgh sports themed items.  They also serve some things you don't see everywhere else, like a sandwich with ham, fried egg, tomato and french fries. Decent beer selection. Daily dinner specials.   I'm a fan of the giant fish sandwich, the cajun pasta and the italian hoagie.  They have added an outdoor dining area to their already large seating area. Don't be apprehensive when you see a crowded parking lot - they can accommodate a lot of diners. But Friday and Saturday nights will probably mean a wait at peak dinner hours.   The service is always friendly and prompt. Prices are on the low side of the moderate range for meals.  Review based on about a dozen visits.",

NPL is a great Pittsburgh feeling stop, with tons of locals and great service.  Tons of TVs so you can always catch a current game, and they even added small TV screens to the booth tables.  The owner is very personable and you can see him checking in with tables on a regular basis.  Definitely a recommended stop if you are in the area but are not familiar with NPL.",
