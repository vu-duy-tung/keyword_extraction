I don't drink coffee, so can't comment on that, but I their teas are great (I've tried most of them) and their Chai Latte is amazing. Perhaps as importantly for me, their internet connection is free, fast, and reliable.  This is the former location of Aldo coffee and I was around for the (surprisingly smooth) transition; it seems to me like Orbis kept everything good about Aldo while infusing the place with new energy.",

The foam was thick and luxurious and the espresso was smooth and delicious. Its a little expensive for me to get more than once a week (but comparable to most large scale coffee shops), but I will defiantly be going back for a treat this weekend!",

Be warned that the made-to-order brunch food is not served unto 10 AM (although a couple that ordered right after us was somehow allowed to order their brunch food at 9:45 and was served before 10 AM).  Don't come here if you plan on ordering food and are in a hurry (unless you are said couple aforementioned).   I'd definitely come back for food and coffee when I don't need to be anywhere.",

The espresso is usually Intelligentsia (Black Cat) which is a big plus. They have a range of drinks for absolutely everyone, from coffee snobs to flavored-sugar-coffee addicts. That's a hard crowd to keep everyone happy, but Orbis does it right.  The batch brew coffee is priced well and sometimes is great, other days it is not-so-good. I wish it was more consistent so that I could count on a great cup every time. Sometimes it is very disappointing.  The snacks are great here too, and I look forward to a breakfast soon!",

I think it was partially me being slightly intimidated by their broad offering and the barista, who was working by herself, being really busy. So I gave that lackluster experience a pass and kept an open mind for giving it another shot. Glad I did because I had an excellent cappuccino. It really tasted amazing. Unfortunately they only make it in one size, but when the quality is as good as this, that's ok by me. They have a smallish selection of baked goods. Must admit, they are not at the level of the neighboring coffee house up the street, but they are still good. Also, when making that comparison, the crowd here is a more on the professional side and 30+ compared to the 20+ and moms w/babies & strollers. Neither better than the other, just an observation and nice to have two good options in the same area. Decor inside is cool with a Roman/Grecian vibe, high ornate ceillings and hardwood floors. Also, free wifi!",

Since they don't roast their own beans, they have to mark up the beans they buy from other purveyors, which makes it a more expensive spot to buy.

It's been so uncomfortable on those occasions that I've actually left the premises rather than buying another cup of coffee.  I have noticed, though, that if I \"dress up\" I am treated more civilly. This is more than a little repugnant. My apologies, Orbis, but this kind of treatment of well-paying customers is unacceptable and I would be remiss if I didn't alert others to this behavior.",

I appreciated my latte art by my barista which really matched the time and care they put into the store's decorations. It's really diverse from African masks to Japanese umbrellas to daisies to Seurat-inspired paintings. You feel more cultured just by parking your toosh there for a while.

    "text": "So let me start this review by saying that I'm not really a coffee drinker. My bar is set at Starbucks (and I just lost all the coffee snobs in the room).  Ok, for those of you still with me, because I admittedly don't like plain coffee, I am pretty much a lightweight when it comes to what I order. I have a standard toffee nut latte that I get from Starbucks on those rare occasions when I want to pump sugar and caffeine into my body, and that's about it. The thing about the toffee nut flavoring is that other than Starbucks, little local coffee shops with limited menus never seem to have it. So even though Starbucks sort of sucks (my coffee snob friend has trained me to taste how they burn their beans) I deal with it for my favorite drink.   Except for Orbis! I went in today and practically hugged the owner behind the counter when I saw that she had a bottle of toffee nut flavoring sitting there. I quickly ordered a toffee nut latte, and it was AMAZING. I finally had my favorite drink without any burned beans, so I could fully appreciate the flavors.  When you eat or drink in the cafe they serve you at your table, and I'm always impressed by the presentation. The drinks always have little hearts in the foam and the plates are served with a teensy garnish bowl of fruit - usually fresh raspberries and blueberries. They do a pretty big breakfast rush, complete with a Sunday brunch. Their quiches are always exotic and fabulous and today I had some sort of cookie with nutella in it and just about died from happiness. Oh, and I've been there before and can attest that they also have an awesome selection of loose-leaf teas (because I *am* a tea snob and understand that well).   Totally love this place's cafe atmosphere  - which is very cozy - and think the place is awesome. Come check it out!",

And yet the charm of Mount Lebanon and the approach of Orbis Cafe gave me hope, and I slyly persuaded my henchbrethren of the need to stop.   Orbis Cafe differs from your normal specialty coffee shop in that it's willing to cater to hipsters and 85 year old grandpeople alike. It's a quaint little shop with some beautiful touches but without the meticulously crafted designs of their significant friends in some other parts of the city. The baristas seemed more flustered and less calm and cool, and yet happy. It's just a place that is capable of pleasing the connoisseurs without turning off the common people. A bit hidden is the obtainability of such a quality thing as a pour-over using Ceremony or Intelligentsia coffee. But it's True! You can even spend $40 on a few ounces of rare coffees like Geisha, Eugenioides and Sudan Rume!   They also carry local 19 Coffee Roasters which I had to try, in the form of a Colombian pour-over. I was a bit skeptical but it turned out to be about a 9.5. On a scale of 1-17. Not bad, not amazing. BUT, there was the heavenly broccoli Brie quiche.   I was revived. I was awakened. I was filled.",

    "text": "Born and bread Pittsburgher now living in San Fran... So this stylish, inviting, delicious lookin coffee shop was a welcome site for a Sunday morning starter while back for a family visit. The Columbian coffee was recommended for more pour over. Good but not great. Felt like the coffee was cooler than it should be and had more bitterness than I'd expect when filtered properly for a pour over (which I make daily at home so I've scorched more than my share). The quiche on other hand were extraordinarily delicious ... Not creamy or high like a French quiche, more like an excellent frittata with a savory crust. Broc and Cheddar paired with Turkey and Saurkraut. Loved the audacity and flavor profiles. Definitely will be back this week to try other coffees and dishes!   Update: Came back on Friday of the same week... New crew so they didn't recognize me. They gained +1 star for their attentive service, new meatball quiche (WTH...crazy great butter crust), and an exceptional Honduras based Americano. Well done, Orbis! I look forward to my next visit to you when I'm back in Pittsburgh!",

I decided to have an Americano to warm up while my girlfriend went with the jasmine green tea.  The tea came in a cute little red teapot for my girlfriend to pour herself and she enjoyed the flavor.  My Americano was both smooth and strong which was nice.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again.  I loved the comforting atmosphere and warm drinks on a cold day.",

    "text": "I've been visiting this coffee house location since I was a high school student - so I've seen it under different names and enjoyed its offerings many times over the years.  As of late, as much as I hate to say it, Orbis has stopped becoming a go-to spot for me. The biggest reason for this, is that their offerings don't really \"do it\" for me. The ingredients don't feel as fresh, truthfully. For example, I thought a plate of quiche I ordered recently tasted stale; and a mocha seemed somewhat \"flat\" and lacking in that delicious flavor that separates a mocha from a standard espresso.  It really pains me to write a lower star review about a family shop, because I always want to see the little guys do well. And Orbis has always been a cute, cozy little place, perfect to meet with friends, to curl up with a book, or get some work done on a laptop. I won't pretend to know the intricacies of their behind-the-scenes process, but if I had to take a guess, a few more checks and balances on when product is shipped in - and regarding how long it's left out in their display case - might be a quick fix to my comments above.  For now, Orbis is an a-ok place that I visit on occasion. But I do still visit it, so I'll be back, and I'll be sure to write an updated review when the right time comes!",

They have a good selection of coffees, expressos, both hot and iced as well as a vast selection of teas. Hot chocolate is also available. In addition they have a small menu of lunch items including quiches. I inquired about the pastries and learned that the majority of them are made down the street from scratch by an Italian lady. Some of the others are made in house which are brought in frozen and then they prepare them. They did identify which were made in house and which were made by the lady down the street.  The counter lady let me sample a blend of coffee before purchase. I was pleased with the taste and decided to order that along with a pumpkin biscotti made by that Italian lady I previously referenced.  My coffee was served in a ceramic cup and my biscotti on a rectangular plate. Both were very good and was well pleased with service I had received. Desserts range about $1.50 give or take. Take out service is available.  Can't wait to try the quiche but will have to save it for a return visit. It looked delicious and I'm sure it is.",

    "text": "I stopped into this coffee shop to get an iced coffee before heading to get my hair done at a salon nearby by.  The cafe was busy but the they kept the line moving.  They had some great coffee offerings.  It made it hard to choose.  I went with an Iced Mocha.  I was disappointed that they didn't have a bigger size than what they had.  It was the equivalent of a medium at other coffee shops.  I put my order in and it was only a minute or two before my order was ready.  The friend I was with found us a small table to sit at to talk and enjoy our coffee.  I was hooked after taking the first sip.  I like strong coffee and this iced coffee was made with exactly that.  I usually order extra ice to cool the coffee down quicker but since I couldn't order a bigger size I just kept it as they offer it.  Next time I would order a cup of ice and just pour my coffee over that.  There was just enough mocha but it wasn't overwhelming which was nice.  I like the taste of coffee and to have the mocha enhance it, not cover it up.  I drank it so quickly that I almost ordered a second one.  If I would have had more time I would have.  The shop is nice and welcoming.  There was a variety of people inside which is always nice.  They had big tables and small tables so you could take a group in or just sit by yourself.  Everyone seemed relaxed which is always a good sign.  The cafe is in a busy shopping district so it would be a place to take a break from shopping or to go grab coffee after a meal.",

I would give it 3 stars because it is like so many other good-quality local coffee shops, but I'm adding a star because they have pastries baked right there. I had a cinnamon roll with icing, right out of the oven and warm. On a cold and rainy morning. Easily worth that 4th star, and I suspect that if I spent more mornings at this place they'd earn that star and maybe another one on their own.",

Great coffee and tea selection and the food is incredible! We always order the quiche of the day, the recipe is always very creative and surprisingly delicious!   The thing you definitely want to try here is Sunday Brunch! The menu is always changing and once again always delicious. (I could go on and on)  The atmosphere is cozy and quaint. I'm telling you, you've gotta give it a try!!!",
