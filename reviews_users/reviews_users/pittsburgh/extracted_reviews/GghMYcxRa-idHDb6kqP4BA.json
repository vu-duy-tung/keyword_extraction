Had the special for dinner, stuffed peppers with red potatoes- it was decent, not out of this world good, just OK.  We also ordered the spinach dip- the 2nd place in PA that I tried the spinach dip and it just isn't that great, I am not sure what the deal is-  the price seemed a little steep to me for what you get, but then again I was just visiting the area so not sure if that is typical price for that part of town. Service was great, and the bathroom's were clean. this place was very busy though and really loud.",

Our waitress was too busy making shots and checking her text messages to get us food or beer. Table of 2 behind us had to request a new waitress as well. Had to go to the bar to order our last round before we closed out! Not hot waitresses as everyone else says...We describe them as Completely clueless! There was no manager or owner visible in this place! Shame on whoever runs it! They are surely losing tons of money every second as we went elsewhere to watch the rest of the game and to eat dinner. They are not even worth 1 star!",

Scattered among the typical bar food choices are glamour shots of the young ladies, occasionally with local celebs (read: Steelers).  It's really kind of funny.  Pretty to look at, but hit and miss on actual service and drink mixing ability.  However, this place is always buzzing with the Chartiers Valley locals.  A good people watching place to see folks you used to go to high school with.  Parking is plentiful and they are open until a decent hour, so it's a great alternative for locals who don't want to go \"dahntahn\", but want to mix with a crowd.    They play recorded music and have lots of flat screen TVs if there's a game on that you want to see.  It's been recently remodeled and expanded, so business must be good.  Wide selection of beer as the name suggests.  Lots on tap and plenty of bottles.  Apparently it's kind of a help yourself to the coolers for bottles then wait (and hope) for your waitress to come by and open it for you.",

I'm sure it is great as a guy to have a good looking waitress or bartender, and they are,  which is their huge appeal, but the reason you are there is to have beverage or food service and I feel like that is NOT a priority here. I would say that of the few(at least 5) times we have been here, 90% of the staff is tragic when it comes to service. We were recently told, after we had a group of 12, that they couldn't do separate checks, which I know is so annoying for service staff, but we asked at the beginning and were never then told that it was not possible. A lot better places nearby!",

The waitress came to our table, refilled my drink, then saw another drink was empty and only refilled that glass while the other two drinks at the table were empty. She made 4 trips with 4 drinks.  The beer selection is great, the owner is a very nice guy, but the girls working there need to learn how to serve tables.

I have ordered take out a few times and it's hit or miss whether they act like you are bothering them with taking your order or not. When I go to pick it up I wait a good 5 to 10 mins before someone even bothers to look at me, a female, at a bar full of men. It is nice that you can help yourself at night to the cooler and pay for the beer at the bar, that keeps your beer fresh and cool.",

We met outside the place and walked in.  It's a huge place and great for watching games. Two giant projector TVs are on both sides of the bar and smaller HiDef TVs are everywhere, not a bad seat in the house. There are about 17 beers on tap including 6 pretty good IPAs, and about 150 types of bottled beer. I chose a terrific IPA, Route 113, and Jesus, er, I mean Jimmy ordered a Red Stripe Jamaican Lager. We sucked them down fast, and figured we better order something to eat.   Nice menu, the usual with some pretty amazing surprises thrown in to keep you on your toes. One of the surprises was fried duck wings, panko crusted and deep fried. I ordered the red pepper roasted hummus, served with warm pita points and a side of chopped purple onions, it was a nice crunchy topping for the smooth, garlicky, flavorful hummus. Friend Jimmy ordered the Big Texas Burger, a six ounce patty with two strips of applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, onion rings and something called Bottleshop sauce. Looked mighty tasty, even to a vegan. He had a side of smashed potatoes and a pickle.   Why only three stars? The service was sad. I had to ask our waitress three times for the check and when it did come it seemed awfully high. We did some quick arithmetic and discovered she charged us for three beers each when in actuality we each had two beers each. Padding the bill? No idea, honest mistake, no idea. Keep track of what you eat and drink here, you may save ten bucks on the tab.",

The bar looks great, but the restaurant is unbelievably neglected. Burned out overhead lights make the place seem like a dive. Easily the most filthy floor I have ever seen. Very hot waitresses that have no business waiting (they giggle a lot and say \"like, sorry I totally forgot that, he he\" way to often). Here was my dinner experience yesterday:  No lights on?! - The light from the dark day outside and T.V.s made me think I was going to sit next to an 80 year old woman chain smoking or a construction worker burping the alphabet.  Slip and Slide - The floor is disgusting. Worse than any dive in the city.squashed french fries, used napkins, spit, sticky booze, and the like. Slipped several times.  Hookers or Waitresses? - This isn't Hooters, but you wouldn't know it from the completely clueless staff with giant boobs, fresh fingernail polish and about 3 inches of cover up on their faces. Our waitress didn't know the specials and when we found it on the menu said, \"oh -- he he -- I didn't know that\". So much body spray, I smelled like her 2 hours later. Their menus are covered with photos of famous Pittsburgher's with these waitresses like they are cheap hookers. But it's okay because...  Every guy at the bar is a stereotypical douchebag. -  Baseball hats just a little askew to look cool, shell necklaces, perfectly white K-Swiss shoes and sleeveless button up dress shirts. All these guys did (about 50 of them) was drool over the waitresses and flirt drunkenly. Very loud and distracting.   Bar food or fine dining? - Bar food is average, very average. In the mood for Fillet Minion? They have it. The menu has everything, but its a mess. A joketastic mess. Also the menus are sticky torn and have many sauces all over them. Some interesting choices though and my wings were okay.  Beer - Tons in the bottle, but their taps are very lacking. As if saying we are to good for the city of Pittsburgh (this place is in Bridgeville, not the city of Pittsburgh), the have zero local beers on tap. In the real city of Pittsburgh, that is a sin.  The bill - 2 beers, three meals = $60=tip!!!!!! Crazy!!!!!! The attitude of this place goes as follows. \"Hey, we give you \"hot\" girls to look at and we have every dish ever created. And beer. So we can charge what we want because the average income in the area is over $65K a year. Did we mention the chicks? Hot chicks man!\"  Skip it...defiantly skip it!",

The food selection is typical American fare, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, salads, wings...the usual. Sadly, it really suffers in the quality dept.    They usually have decent beer specials, and since their expansion they've added more taps, so there's usually  something yummy (craft beer) on draft.  If you go to eat any time after 7:30 p.m. on the weekend you will get to enjoy to the parade of skanky-ness that comes out at dark.   The place becomes so packed with bros you will actually be able to TASTE the cologne  in the air around you. It also seems that they've upgraded their sound system. Last weekend we went after taking a long hiatus from this place and it sounded like a thumping strip club.  It's likely that you will have to wait a very long time to to get a table. We tend to go before then, so we don't have to deal with the hoards of Zack Bagginses.",

I did not order any food, went there after dinner to get a beer, so cannot comment on the food. The beer selection is good, and the service is very good. It seems like a popular place to hang out. This was my first time and I was not disappointed.",

And I have to say, I think the prices are pretty reasonable when you consider the selection carried.  Their food is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I would say it's a step above your average \"bar food\" menu, but it definitely isn't gourmet either. But with that being said, you get a good meal for what you pay for. I've never really been disappointed, just don't go expecting to rave about the food. But I've never complained about it either!",

Were is the management?  We had a large group and ordered several apps.  Took 50 minutes for the apps.  The wings are OK but about the time we were finishing the wings our waitress finally showed up with plates for everyone and napkins.  Not great to eat a wing and have no place to put the bone.  The nacho's came out cold with some of the worst cold soggy cheese. Meh.   Finally were asked if we wanted to order our meals and it took 45 minutes. Most just ordered some type of burger and most said it was well done, not the way it was ordered.  I chose the Santa Fe wrap and it was OK.  The place was so noisy, yea the football games were on.   So if you are not in a hurry or just want some beer this is an OK place.",

    "text": "Three stars is described as \"A-OK\" and that is exactly how I felt about the bottle shop. I stopped here with three girlfriends to have a dinner to catch up. It wasn't clear when you walk in but since no one approached ups it seemed fine to seat ourselves. A waitress quickly came over and told us that while she wasn't our server, she would take our drink orders until our server could make it over. This was appreciated.   They have tons of drafts and bottles (obviously), but I went with the Bell's Oberon which was on special for $3, as I thought that was a good price. We had the Yuengling Beer Cheese dip as an appetizer. It was a little small but tasty. The pretzels were hot and fried and the cheese was tasty, though it could have been a bit hotter.   For my dinner I got the brisket sandwich, which was one of the chef's specials. It was tasty but nothing to write home about. The brisket was well prepared and not overcooked, but the bun was standard grocery store hamburger bun style and I think it had some cheddar cheese and LTO. Some BBQ sauce would have complimented it well but I didn't think to ask for any. The fries were tasty but a small portion (fine with me as that's already plenty of food but some people probably would have felt shorted).   After eating, we were still talking though confirmed to our waitress we didn't want any more drinks. She didn't rush us at all, which was cool, but checked back a few times. It seems like she wasn't sure when to ask if she should bring the checks. After about an hour, I went ahead and told her she could bring them and she brought them out promptly, and even split the appetizer without asking, which I loved.   I would come back if someone invited me but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

Food: I had serious issues here. I got one of the daily specials... It was a gyro wrap. It came out after about 15 minutes, a fair and reasonable time. The fries were cold and obviously old. The wrap was missing the gyro sauce. I asked for some and got a little tiny cup of water-like gyro sauce. Their was enough meat on the entire wrap for about one good bite. The rest of it was all lettuce and tomatoes. I honestly had two bites on the meat part and it was gone. Unless I wanted a salad I was left very hungry. What a sad sandwich. Sorry I came hear for lunch. Will be my last time here when I'm hungry.",

I had a shrimp po boy, which was on special that day and it was really good. I have no complaints about the food at all. But the service is a little bit...meh. I'll agree with other reviewers that it's apparent the waitresses are probably hired based on how attractive they are. A big hint of this is that the menu features more pictures of the smiling waitresses in tiny tank tops than it does of the actual food. I get that some places just operate this way, which is fine, especially for a sports bar. But I do wish the service was better. It took our waitress about 15 minutes to take our order. Then once we had our food she never checked back until we had already been done for ten minutes.   If you're in the area I'd say it's an a-okay place to stop for lunch or a few drinks, but it's definitely not a place I'd make a special trip for.",

I had a Chicken Caesar Wrap and my chicken was a bit dry, though boyfriend said his Santa Fe Chicken Wrap was good. I brought a Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie to my father and he loved it.

    "text": "What happened to this place?  The Bottleshop used to be this unique place with an awesome beer selection.  My husband had lunch with his groomsman @ the BS the day of our wedding and we've taken out of town guests in the past... We hadn't been in about 6 months and wanted to catch the end of the Pens game after dinner with friends.  Let me just say, it'll be an even longer time before we return again.  The place was packed, which, at first, was good to see for a local business.  The waitress finally came over and took our order... she was so scantily clad that I was a little uncomfortable looking at her. The attitude just seethed out of her to the point where we felt as if our order was a bother to her.  Every time we turned around to try to find her, she was either flirting with the douche bags at every table around us or txting.    Aside from that, the beer selection has totally changed.  They used to have coolers lining the walls full of an amazing selection.  Now, their selection isn't far off from what you'd expect at, god forbid, an Applebees or TGI Fridays.  The food was never that great, but the beer selection and laid-back atmosphere made up for it.  Not sure what happened here, but pretty sure we won't be back.",

    "text": "What a disaster of a place! Wow!    A group of friends got together and decided to have drinks and dinner after work here. We made a reservation to ensure that we would have a table and collected there over a few minutes. the place looks nice. It's clean, bright, and the industrial look and feel works nicely. One side is completely occupied by the U-shaped bar and the woman working there was relatively quick in getting our orders. She did tend to disappear for long stretches of time, so getting refills was a chore.   Once our whole group arrived, we asked her to point us to our table only to find out that was not her task. She pointed to someone else .. who then pointed to a table with a piece of paper on it, so we walked over there. We were quickly provided with more menus than we could use as well as cutlery, and then left to look things over. We decided on an appetizer to share - the nachos - as well as what our main meals would be... and then we waited ... and waited ... and waited some more. About 20 minutes in, I asked a worker who walked by if we were forgotten? She gave me a startled look and ran off without saying a word. However, a few minutes later, our waitress showed up. She only wanted to take our drink order but we \"convinced\" her to take the appetizer and entree orders as well.  Drinks and the appetizer came out quickly. However, the nachos were a mess. Take tortilla chips that you get in the supermarket, pour some thinned-down Velveeta on a corner of the plate, throw some pickled Jalapenos (maybe 10 slices) over the top, and then garnish with some shredded Kraft \"Mexican blend\" cheese and serve cold. Not good.  For our entrees we had to wait another 40 minutes. Not sure why it took so long as they were on their regular menu. One of us got the fish sandwich and he said it was practically inedible as it was fried until the whole thing was a brick! Another got the Chicken Fajita Warp which was completely tasteless and room temperature. Other got the Chicken Parmesan plates... and most of it was left in the plates because of overcooking the chicken and a completely uninteresting sauce. We waited for so long and we get ... trash.  The beer menu was also a disappointment. Mostly humdrum offerings that you can pick up in any supermarket around town. Definitely a place to be avoided.",

But really, would it be so much trouble to give my family of four our own bill?  The service was poor.  Forever to get drinks, and had to literally flag down our waitress several times to even get a food order.  She walked right past us and refused to make eye contact.  The food was fair.  We had the soft pretzels with cheese dip.  For the price, it could've been a much nicer portion than the small portion we wound up with.  We also had a pizza, which was adequate, if messy.  And we were shorted utensils, so that was difficult.   Also, we were not provided with real plates- just very small, saucer shaped plates.  Not conducive to a slice of messy pizza.  No visible managers.  We will not be back, even though we live close by.",

Almost no sauce and I'm pretty sure the meat had gone bad. They had a horrible taste and i had to use blue cheese just to eat a few of them. I had them packed to go but threw them in the garbage as soon as I got outside. And I got sick about 2 hours after eating and I'm positive that's what it was from. I also need to say the \"entertainment\" went way down hill. They used to be legendary for their bartenders and waitresses but this looked like a Denny's midnight crew",

While our waitress was overly made up with a full face of makeup, yet dressed down in leggings (must be the dress code), not once did I see her smile. However, I did notice her take special attention (with smiles and batting of the eyelashes) to a table of 20-something year old men.  No joke, she did not once smile at us, in which I suppose I shouldn't be surprised since our group consisted of married couples.   While service was terrible during my visit, I did appreciate their large selection of beer. They have a large draft list and an even larger bottle offering, making this a great place to enjoy a few drinks. Unfortunately, the one beer I wanted on draft that night wasn't available during my visit. However, I was able to find it in a bottle in their cooler. A couple of my friends ordered food and everything looked decent.   I would be willing to give this place another shot on a night that isn't so busy, which may affect the level of customer service.",

Pretty nondescript sign as I drove by the place at first glance.  Inside my initial impression is that the place looks new and clean, two things you can't argue about - even though it's apparently been around for a decade.  There's really not much character. It's a sports bar and seems like it would be a good place to watch a game with two large projection screens and lots of TV's it's fairly clear what they're going for as the appeal, and they're situated behind the bar.  They have a modest selection of beer on tap and several coolers full of bottled varieties. Not a huge selection by any means but the pricing seemed very fair to me.  I ordered some cheese sticks that were very good, so I can't speak much for the menu otherwise.  Overall, it's a sports bar with friendly and attractive female bartenders. So if that's your thing, id recommend it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "When the first draft I tried to order was out, they immediately lost a star.  It looks like they have a lot of taps but the selection isn't the best.  There is a wall of coolers, though, so I eventually made my way over there for a few bottles.  We also ordered food, I had a turkey wrap and my friend a burger.  Food was average, not bad but not something I'd go back for.  I did kind of like the U-shaped bar surrounded by tables.  I was not a fan of the front wall of windows.    I had no complaints about the service however the menu cover is pictures of, I can only guess, their favorite patrons and pretty servers.  It didn't seem to go at all with the rest of the atmosphere, at least when I was there.  I can see it being a cool place to watch a game, but I don't really get that friendly neighborhood bar feel.  It's difficult to decide between 2 and 3 stars.  I mean, for the 2, yeah, I've experienced better and I don't think I'll go back.  But the 3 is A-OK.  I'm stuck in the middle but will post this review with 3 only because other than being out of my first draft choice, I did not have any other major complaints.  Pittsburgh Bottleshop needs to decide if it wants to be more upscale with better beer selections and menu entrees or more of a sports bar where it's okay to have Miller Lite on tap and lots of fried appetizer specials during Steelers games.  Right now it's somewhere in the middle, kind of like my rating.",

However the food is still very greasy, fried, unoriginal fare but honestly that's what I expect here and I am ok with that to watch a football game. There are tons of tvs and good views from all seats.  Our bottled beers were grossly warm today but the bartender realized it about 10 min later, asked us if they were warm and suggested we switch to the draft list since someone might have left the cooler open all night (gross, I hope it it only held beer) but appreciate the honesty.   All in all, don't recommend for a meal but if you live in the Immediate area decent place to meet for a beer and catch a game.",

I miss the variety of beers I could get.   Their beers do have good taste, they are not at the maturity of some the items they no longer provide.  The service was on point.   The food was good.    I will definitely go back and hope that it grows on me.",

Our waitress either woke up on the wrong side of the bed or makes it her life mission to ignore people and act like a total b!$*#&. This place could have served the best food I have ever eaten in my life and I would never go back because of her. We were there as a very large party and pretty much the entire lot of us felt the same way. People don't frequent public places to get ignored and they certainly don't enjoy spending their hard earned money on someone who things they are entitled to a tip because they took an order. The bartenders were very nice to us so that was a good thing. The management really needs to do some training with their employees unless they enjoy never having repeat customers. The fries and wings were both very good. No military discount.",

Food was great...excellent service...great drink selection.  I was coming from Moon to meet some friends from Mt. Lebo so it seemned a perfect meet up spot.  I was nervous after reading newer reviews.  No need to be nervous!  Food was great!  Drinks were good.  Service was great!  Nice spring breeze coming in the open doors.  I had a fantastic mixed grill salad and everyone else was happy with theirs.  Nothing fancy, but good and reasonably priced.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",

    "text": "This place has definitely gone downhill since the new owner took over. Every single employee who I've seen in there in the last three years is gone because he fired them all. The quality of the replacement staff is very poor.  Whereas the former owner had experienced, knowledgeable employees who were attentive and polite, these new bartenders and servers are rude and disconnected.  The only one employee left is the rudest bartender ever, Amie.  Apparently she is in a relationship with the new owner, although she is apparently married, and this creates for awkward glances and comments from the rest of the staff. It's a shame because the Bottleshop used to be a Pittsburgh institution and now it's an embarrassment.  I would highly recommend the Railyard down the road in Bridgeville which has come back as an amazing new establishment serving the locals.",

REALLY loud. I could barely hear this guy the whole night. I digress.   He ordered drinks, and I had a water. He seemed to enjoy his IPA, and we ordered a quesadilla. It was just okay. Chicken, cheese and what seemed to be canned green peppers. Their salsa was pretty good, though!   The server was rather non existent. Kind of disappointing. She would be there, and then be gone, before you could leave before you could say what you needed.   The dating game continues.   Happy Eating!",

We all had different types of Redbull mixers and LOVED them! I had the mixed grill salad and wings...OMG, the salad was HUGE and the wings were delicious. I know there under new ownership, and I have to say they did a very good job with the cooking and serving. My husband and girlfriend had the salmon, their only complaint was that her portion was considerably smaller then his. Our guy friend had the Ruben, and it was also a very generous portion, and he said it was delicious. We definitely plan to return!",

When we said something they said they were busy and the people next to us got fried food that's why it didn't take as long.   Apparently 2 chicken Caesar wraps and a fajita chicken wrap is too complicated to get out in a timely manner for them. They had no problem just printing drink checks and didn't have any problem not charging us for food. I'm unsure if our food was ever put in.  We left without receiving our food.  Will probably never go back.",

It took server 5 minutes to wait on us then once she brought the drinks, another 15 minutes to take food order.   Their beer tasted like a typical kit beer....not too tasty.  We ended up not ordering food.   They used to have a huge bottle selection (hence the name). Now they tried to brew their own and it's not working (in my opinion).  They need to perfect their beers, maybe hire more people - and keep regular menu.  Servers were pretty nice.",

Flat screens throughout give you a good view so you don't miss any of the action. The menu offers a nice selection of finger foods and entrees. Our table ordered nachos, fried zucchini, spinach artichoke dip, salad and wings. I'm not a beer drinker but they have large variety of it if that's your thing. Their frozen cocktails were yummy. The food came out fairly quickly, tasted good and prices fair for the quality and quantity.  I read complaints about the service but I didn't have a bad experience. The Steelers were playing and there was a bunch of people but the girls were working their butts off with a smile. On a side note, my squad pulled in the win so it was a good day. #gosteelers",

We loved the burgers so decided to go back for them. But this time the service was a total suck feast.  Apparently the first gal, who could not be able to smile, just ask \"what do you want to drink?\" - well let us have the drink Keanu first since there are 20 beers thanks - it seemed that her shift was ending and we were intruding on that.  And so she dropped us like a hot potato and counted her draw. Then she stands around talking to the other staff members and we still do not have drinks.  The place was not busy and the bar was at 65% filled. It just took too long for everything to happen!  The burgers were good again but I find it annoying that you have to say you want tomato and lettuce with it. Nothing on the menu states this at all. The fries are good though.   Lastly, I am not a fan of the black spandex workout pants for look the wait staff wears.",
