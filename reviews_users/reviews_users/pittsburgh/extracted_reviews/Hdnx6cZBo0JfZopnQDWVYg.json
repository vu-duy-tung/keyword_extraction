    "text": "Having never had Okonomiyaki, savory Japanese pancakes, I wasn't really sure what to expect with Teppanyaki Kyoto. Um...whoa. Even the pics here on Yelp don't do the insanity of these pancakes justice. I got the Hiroshimayaki and it was a very thin layer of pancake covered in heaps of cabbage, yaki soba, egg, beef strips, and finished with a ridiculous amount of sauce (spicy mayo and brown sauce) and bonito flakes. It actually freaked me out a little when it arrived--it was HUGE and the flakes of fish were swaying in a creepy fashion from the steam coming off the plate. It looked like it was ALIVE. Me: \"Why is it moving?\" My friend: \"Yeah, I'm just trying to ignore that.\"  Okay, so I'm not sure Okonomiyaki is my thing. I am one of those people that like their foods not to touch each other on the plate and have a phobia of casseroles, etc. Okonomiyaki was a little too much of a mess of flavors for me. I kind of scraped off the sauce/bonito because it was the most intense flavor on there, and proceeded to eat the rest of the layers separately. Each component was good, especially the beef. I could see why people would like this crazy bastard pancake.  Since the Hiroshimayaki takes an estimated 25 minutes to prepare, we did get appetizers. The calamari was really good, but I really didn't like the salsa that came with it (yes, salsa, like the Mexican stuff). The shrimp and avocado had a sweet sauce on it that I liked a lot.  It's cool that Teppanyaki Kyoto is trying to do authentic Japanese without bringing sushi into the mix and I think they are doing it very well. However, I can't help but wish that their menu was a little longer. It is very short compared to most other restaurants focused on a specific ethnic food. The majority of it is made up of Okonomiyaki variations, so if you're not a big fan of the pancake, you don't have too many other choices. But if you do like them...then awesome, totally recommended! For me, just \"A-OK.\"  Update: I've heard that they have expanded their menu beyond just Okonomiyaki, so hoping I can come back to try other dishes soon!",

    "text": "After multiple visits to Teppanyaki, I am impressed with their careful, clean preparation of wholesome food. My favorite dishes are the special okonomiyaki pancakes, featuring softened cabbage, spicy mayo, and amazing barbeque sauce, and the bacon-wrapped mochi (though I would not label this \"wholesome\", it is a delightfully chewy rice pillow wrapped in bacon with a rich, sweet, salty glaze). Many of their seasonal specials have been equally delicious, and this place is a haven for vegetarians. Excellent.",

    "text": "I want to love this restaurant- it's part of the Bryant Street revitalization, is walking distance from my house, and is reasonably priced. However, after multiple bad experiences, I will not be returning. The final straw occured when I recently had dinner here with 3 other adults and one toddler.   First, upon overhearing us discussing the menu, the waiter impatiently asked if he was going to be \"dealing with any vegetarians\". We thought he was being rude to be funny, but learned later he was in fact, just rude.  We immediately ordered simple appetizers so that my toddler would be occupied- edamame (which they store frozen so they only need to be quickly boiled) and the bacon-wrapped mochi (arguably one of the more popular menu items). We then ordered a bottle of wine. There are only 4 red wines on the menu. When we picked one the waiter said- oh, Ive never had anyone order that before- as if we had made some obscure choice. It was so odd and his tone was so accusatory. It made no sense. We tried to just laugh it off.  About 15 min later we ordered our entrees.   10 min later 2 of the 4 entrees arrived, but no sign of the apps. When we inquired, the waiter told us it was because different chefs make different dishes and the chef assigned to the 2 entrees we had received wasn't very busy at the moment so those dishes were finished first. A ridiculous explanation- appetizers are called starters on the menu for a reason- you start with them!  Another 10 min went by before the apps arrived.  10 minutes later (1 hour after we sat down) the other 2 entrees showed. 2/4 adults in our party had long since finished their meals.  At this time, my 3 year old asked if she could have some noodles. I asked the waiter if we could have a side dish of noodles (they have sides of rice on the menu). He said he \"wasn't sure\" and he would check. 25 MINUTES WENT BY- and my husband had to get up and go get the waiter to check on the status of the noodles we had ordered. The waiter told us he hadn't had a chance to ask the chef. Now, we are sitting at a table in front of the chefs. I could have asked for them by simply raising my voice! I was floored. I asked to speak with a manager and was told the manager was the chef and was too busy to talk to us.  5 minutes later the waiter returned and said he could not bring a side dish of noodles because the chefs didnt want to \"open another package of noodles\". Outraged, I told him we obviously would be paying for the noodles, there are noodles on the menu- why would he not cook them for us? The waiter had no response except to say the chef said no.  As we left, we overheard the same waiter tell a customer that he had lost her reservation and he had no tables for her available. The customer then pointed at our empty table and asked if her party could sit there and the waiter replied, \"yeah, I guess I could set it for you.\"  Are they TRYING to NOT make money here and drive customers away?   It's really unfortunate that this restaurant has such terrible customer service. On past visits I've had to wait 45 min for the check, and had another experience of 1 of 4 entrees arriving 30 min after the others (and not the Okonomiyaki which the menu clearly says takes 25 min to cook- this was a simple noodle small plate that just didnt arrive until everyone else was done eating- no explanation, no apology).  I want to like this place- the food is actually really good. But I refuse to pay for such terrible customer service again. I'll opt for noodles from Smiling Banana Leaf, or dine in at E2 or Park Bruges when out in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "When most Americans think about Japanese food and Japanese restaurants, what do they think of? Almost certainly sushi or something else with raw fish. Maybe some sort of noodle or even chicken katsu don since fried chicken is something easily recognizable to the average American palate.   It was with great excitement that I found out a new restaurant was opening in Pittsburgh showing off a different side of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant primarily serves okonomiyaki (a sort of savory pancake). My significant other and I ordered the Hiroshimayaki for a main and chicken meatballs and onigiri for an appetizer.   The chicken meatballs were perfectly cooked, vaguely crunchy on the outside and tender inside. The onigiri was more for my partner (she loved it), but it's basically just toasted rice with a bit of seaweed and soy sauce. Good, but nothing I couldn't make at home.   The real star of the meal was the Hiroshimayaki. It consists of a thin pancake, a mound of cabbage, some soba noodles with soy sauce, some beef strips (with the options of chicken, pork, or no meat at all), and a fried egg on top. Oh yeah, it's all topped with a spicy mayo. Amazing. It was a large amount of food and more than enough for the both of us, but I wanted more. It was hard to decide if I wanted to eat the various ingredients individually or a bit of each all at once. My advice: do both, alternating.  My partner asked how I liked it as we left. I responded, \"That was obscenely good.\"   A last bit of advice... Go.",

I have eaten lots of Japanese food but only in other cities do I feel as though the food is very authentic.  Teppanyaki seems very authentic, but yet comfortable.  Someone labeled it Osaka Soul Food and that sounds right.  The chef took his time in preparing the food (the menu says that the special pancakes will take 25 min but you can get a salad or beer or wine or sake while you wait).  The whole experience was quite lovely.  The whole restaurant felt very clean, esp the bathroom, which is always an indicator of how clean the whole place is.  As a side point, if you thought there was too much mayo in the past, it is now served on the side so that need not be a deterrent.  I liked everything about this place because i want to sample the whole menu!",

    "text": "I went to Teppanyaki Kyoto this week. It was a weeknight and was very quiet when we arrived-- it was about 6 PM, and we were the only people there! However, as we ate, a few more people stopped in.  The only Japanese food I'd had before was the typical, probably American-ized stuff, like teriyaki or sushi. So I was  excited to try this! We ordered a couple of appetizers--  calamari with salsa the bacon-wrapped mochi. Both were excellent. The salsa that came with the calamari was especially great! For dinner, I ordered the \"Japanese Pancake\"... I can't remember what it was called or how to spell it! For the uninitiated (like me), they look a big pile of cabbage, mixed with some batter and your meat of choice, fried it up (in a pancake shape, sort of) and topped it with all kinds of sweet and spicy sauces. Delicious! The only drawback was that I ordered it with pork, not knowing that it was actually pork belly. This could be ignorance on my part (because I know very little about this kind of food!) or something lost in translation on the menu, but I ended up picking around the pork belly, since it was just too fatty for my taste.  Like many other reviewers, they seated us at the counter. It seems like the tables were for those who had made reservations. However, I really liked being at the counter-- I enjoyed watching them cook the food, and I liked seeing what other people ordered... It gave me some ideas for next time. :) We got to talk to the chef too, who was really friendly. Overall, the service was quick and friendly, the decor was pretty cool, and the food was great! (with the exception of my mistake about the pork) I will definitely be back, but maybe order something with shrimp next time!",

I had the tofu and mushroom stake and a plate of ramen noodles. The flavor was so light and savory and the texture of the tofu was so smooth. It was like butta! Do not be fooled! These ramen noodles are not the noodles of your college years, but their grown up sophisticated (and super tasty) cousin. Prices where very reasonable and the atmosphere very welcoming.

It's bit salty too, but well within my tolerance level. This restaurant has good atmosphere but foods were not great, compared with the atmosphere.

My brother who was a somewhat known butcher in Pittsburgh(and a hell of a cook in my opinion), we always discussed the intrinsic quality of food. That when you eat a meal, you can certainly pick apart and quantify every aspect of the meal, but when something is awesome you know it immediately. Every appetizer, entree, and Sake was that way here. You must get some Sake if you drink, and take an Uber!(I really regret not doing so) I'm used to not really feeling comfortable enough to really drink, but this is a delightful place to catch a buzz.

I'm a military kid who was born in Japan so my family kept many of the traditions and food that we picked up while living there. One of the things we did was to always have traditional Japanese food on our birthdays (as my mom had learned recipes from the ladies in the area).  So going back here felt a bit like home and definitely nostalgia, especially for my birthday.  First off, we got to sit in the floor seating area towards the back of the restaurant. Complete with tatami mats, elevated area, seat cushions, and more, it was awesome :) We got a liter of sake for the five of us and our waiter gave a great recommendation based off of what he thought we might like. They give you the option of drinking the sake out of wooden square cups which was also really cool and traditional (my parents still have their wood sake set).   We all got different things, including the okonomiyaki, and shared a lot. While I guess that's not how you should techincally eat, we all really enjoyed trying all of the things. the seaweed salad is a very nice serving portion. I got the Teppanyaki Udon with beef (my waiter said to not get the chicken of this, so heads up) and it was great. We also got vegetable gyoza which was WAY better than any you could get frozen and done yourself. At the end I had green tea mochi and it was a perfect ending.  Definitely check this place out if you want an interesting and delicious experience!",

    "text": "Finally a True okonomiyaki joint. Not only that, one that serves the elusive Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki (aka hiroshimayaki)! This is the only place I've found stateside that serves this. Not the premade frozen crap you find at izakayas. The real deal. Made in front of you on a teppanyaki grill, throwing ingredients down with their bare hands and cooking it up with two spatulas, just as if you were in Japan.  As someone who makes hiroshimayaki at home at least twice a week, I'm not going to lie, I had my doubts about a place like this--especially being in Pittsburgh, which really isn't known for its culinary diversity. Expectations were high, and I watched closely as they assembled our hiroshimayakis, ready to pounce on any mistakes they were doomed to make. \"Not enough noodles,\" I whispered to my girlfriend. \"It's not supposed to be topped with bonito flakes,\" I pretentiously mumbled.  But it was futile. Despite any (insignificant) complaints I had, I was destined to love this place. TK has introduced some traditional comfort food to a region whose knowledge of Japanese cuisine likely consists of cali rolls, onion volcanos, and Sakkio Japan. The food could have been terrible, yet the movement alone would've won me over. Luckily, the food was great, and I'll probably adjust my hiroshimayaki recipe to theirs. Not only that, their shoyu ramen was delicious, as was their house salad with sesame-soy dressing.   I already straight up told my girlfriend we are eating here whenever we go to Pittsburgh. Hell, I'm gonna make up reasons to go to Pittsburgh just so I can come back. 4 stars bumped up to 5, because no one else is doing what they're doing.  P.S. I hate the term Japanese pancake or pizza. It's misleading. It's not even close to what it actually is, so if you've never had okonimiyaki before, DON'T think pancake or pizza.",

Ordered the okonomiyaki with soba noodles and cheese while sitting at the bar to watch the chef make the dish right in front of me. The dish was huge!   The taste of cheese was very faint, but the cabbage mixed with the batter and cheese throughout provided an excellent base for the noodles, which were tender yet slightly crunchy in some areas. It wasn't mind-blowing since I'm Japanese and am accustomed to yakisoba, but the entire dish tasted delicious nonetheless. The waiter was extremely attentive and courteous as well, and he did the finishing touches on my dish with the mayo, seaweed powder, and bonito flakes, which really did look alive as they swayed in front of me.  All in all, I would definitely go back and order other dishes off the menu despite this being a bit far from my university!",

They make a note to tell you the \"pancakes\" may take 25 minutes. It's not a big deal if you get some appetizer items and a beverage. Seemed normal time to me. I like the seats that face the kitchen - you can interact with the folks cooking your meal. We'll be back.",

    "text": "This review is essentially strictly limited to the okonomiyaki on Teppanyaki Kyoto's menu. I've been here twice, and each time I've just tried different varieties of the okonomiyaki because it is probably the best thing they have. Okonomiyaki is a Japanese street food made with a cabbage/egg base and a variety of other ingredients. It's super savory and delicious and has become my favorite food. If you are going to Teppanyaki, you definitely have to try their okonomiyaki or you're missing out. The okonomiyaki is the most authentic I have ever had and is definitely enough as a single person's meal (although because it's cabbage-based, you get hungry quickly).   On another note, I also had their Umeshu (Kikkoman brand plum wine) when I went the second time with a good friend. This may not be something you want to order if you are not a fan of sour tastes; the wine was more of a Asian-style dried plum flavor. Also, at $35 a bottle, it was way overpriced (like many other selections from their drink menu). I went to Roger Wilco, a liquor store in New Jersey that sells a variety of Asian booze, and found the same bottle of Kikkoman Umeshu for $13.",

We have tried almost all of their appetizers, and most of them are great, but the bacon wrapped mochi is definitely something fun to try! And we also like to try the different drinks they offer (mostly the sake). While we have never been to Japan (yet), you can still tell the quality of their food is there because they have put in the effort! Try their yakanomiaki for sure! Their rice bowl is pretty good but the portions aren't that big. But overall we go their to try their small plates since that is where all the interesting items are! I do not recommend ramen. It is not bad but it cannot compare to good ramen in large cities like NYC. But everything else I would say to try it at least once before you judge :) Dessert are great if you like mochi. Also they have this green tea dessert that is always sold out whenever we go, so if you get the chance, try it and let me know :)",

Gyudon was amazing. Gyudon is like one of my favorite food from Japan. The beef was really soft and the rice was not too hard but not too soft. Hiroshimayaki! Omg. It was wonderful!! I think it was the first Hiroshimayaki I had in my life because I usually have Okonomiyaki instead. It was a lot better than Okonomiyaki because there was Yakisoba inside of it. It really filed my hungry stomach. I couldn't eat it all so I brought it back to my hotel and ate rest of it after. There were two things I had as desserts. One was Kashiwamochi. It was so Japanese. The smell of leaf on the mochi and the sweet red beans inside were just so good together and tasty. Second one was dango. Its three pieces of matcha flavored mochi with red beans. You know. Red beans are such good material. It's tasty and makes us feel Japanese.",

That mood...it is a desire for a wholly calm and clean space (visual, mental and digestive), authenticity over eccentricity, simply delightful flavors and Sake.   I think they prefer reservations, so do call ahead if you think about it. The chef is a very friendly and helpful curator of the cuisine. The servers aren't so knowledgeable but this has no negative affect on their presence. Just be very clear if you have dietary restrictions. Try to sit at the kitchen counter at least once for a more informative experience.",

    "text": "Teppanyaki Kyoto is a newcomer to the Highland Park area serving authentic Japanese cuisine. Right now, the restaurant is in their soft-opening phase, where they serve lunch and dinner by reservation only. I called ahead prior to walking in for lunch, and they didn't seem to mind.  Entering, the space is a beautifully and minimally decorated space, with soft Japanese music playing in the background and familiar items of the culture throughout the space. There is a long bench with two-seat tables along it, and in the back it seems like low group tables. Along the side, though, is the centerpiece of the restaurant: the Teppanyaki. Teppanyaki, similar to Hibachi, is food cooked on a large steel griddle in front of the customer. The differences as far as the grills go aren't striking to me, but there are no theatrics in Teppanyaki cooking. Suffice to say, this is not another Hibachi restaurant.   There are 8 seats up against the counter of this Teppanyaki and currently only one chef. I sat at the counter and was handed a two-page menu, and a small drink menu including Japanese beers and a small sake menu. Since it was a working lunch, I had to opt myself out of the other menu. The centerpiece of the menu, and what drew me here, is the Okonomiyaki: a  savory Japanese pancake with ingredients mixed throughout. You can pick ingredients or select a style named after one of four regions throughout Japan. Additonally, the batter has fish broth in it, so vegetarians call ahead and ask if they can make vegetarian batter.  However, upon seeing yakisoba on the menu, my insatiable noodle hunger took over me. Luckily, I didn't have to opt out of trying these pancakes - they also server Hiroshimayaki, which includes noodles. This is made in a separate style, with the ingredients stacked instead of mixed. A thin layer of pancake is spread on the griddle, topped with a heaping mound of cabbage, scallions, and slices of beef. Eventually, it is flipped over and shrinks down as the cabbage cooks, while the chef cooks noodles and an egg off to the side. Finally, the pancake is put on top of the noodles, which is put on top of the egg, which is put in a plate and smothered in sriracha mayo and a thick, dark, sweet sauce and sprinkled with bonito flakes.  It was impressive to watch him work while training another chef. The preparations seem simple, but a lot goes into them. The pancake itself was excellent.  Visually, the sauces are beautifully presented and the bonito flakes silently dance in the heat rising from the pancake. The flavors blended together perfectly, with the sweet sauce complimenting the slightly bitter cabbage, and the egg and noodles giving the dish substance while the beef provided a satisfying chew. I could barely finish the whole thing, but I was able to at the end.   The bill for it with tax was $12, which was an expensive lunch, but they don't really have a lunch menu so it would be an OK dinner price. The menu is pretty much all in the $8-$14 price range with a few items(like a steak) getting closer to $20. The appetizers and salads are in the $4-8 range.  It's always interesting to me to find out that very common food items in one corner of the globe are entirely absent elsewhere. Teppanyaki Kyoto tries to remedy this by introducing Pittsburgh to the Japanese cuisine beyond sushi and udon. I think they do an excellent job, and can't wait to return.",

We got both the Okonomiyaki, as well as the very similar Hiroshimayaki.  Both of them were dominantly cabbage, and most of the flavor seemed to come from the toppings and sauces on top.  The flavor was decent, and it was fun to see it come out with the bonito flakes still moving from the heat.  If you have a problem seeing your meal move, it might not be a good idea to get this :)  Yakitori and Udon needles were decent. They also had a nice selection of sake, and for someone who is not so familiar about sake like me, it was nice to have a lot of options to choose from.  This is a nice alternative to the seemingly endless, run-of-the-mill, not quite authentic Japanese restaurants that primarily focus on sushi.  If you want other to experience other types of Japanese cuisine, give this place a shot. 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "Had my eyes set on Teppanyaki for months, and finally made a visit with a couple of friends.  I love Japanese food, and it's great to have options that are not limited to just Sushi/Sashimi and the miso soup.  Food (8.5/10) = I got hella excited when I visited and ordered quite a few dishes for a party of 3.  1) Okonomiyaki = The Chinese have scallion pancakes. The Koreans have seafood pancake.  The Japanese have Okonomiyaki.  These are pancakes made of flour, eggs, vegetables, proteins, and topped with bonito flakes, served with a mayonnaise based sauce.  There are several options for proteins.  We got the Osaka Mix which includes shrimp, squid, and beef.  The dish can be shared or can be large enough for entree sized satisfaction.  I felt the Okonomiyaki was done well, and would definitely order again. 2) Squid and King Oyster Mushrooms sauteed in white garlic sauce (from the Autumn menu) = One aspect I enjoy with Japanese food is the simplicity of some dishes, and letting the ingredients speak for itself.  This was one of those dishes.  The squid was cooked very well, which many Asian restaurants tend to screw up by overcooking it and making it tough.  The oyster mushrooms were amazing.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  Unfortunate that this dish is seasonal. 3) Korokke (curry flavor) - chopped veggies with mashed potato rolled in wheat flour, eggs, breadcrumbs, then deep fried.  Absolutely loved this.  A great vegetarian option.  The curry essence was not overwhelming.  I thought about ordering another one during my visit...as a dessert, heh. 4) Takoyaki (octopus balls, dumplings made of batter and filled with diced octopus) = Classic.  Whenever I see this at a Japanese restaurant, I order it.   5) Agedashi Tofu (cubed tofu deep fried served with tentsuyu and topped with scallion and grated daikon) = Like Takoyaki, I gravitate towards this dish if it's on the menu.  Another simple dish, but so damn delicious when done well.  The tofu is soft with a thin crispy exterior.  The flavor of the sauce is light and clean. 6) Bacon with Japanese Mochi = A unique dish for me.  Never a pig on mochi before until I came here.  Decided to try it since it was one of the more popular dishes mentioned on Yelp.  I wasn't impressed with the dish.  I usually love anything involving pork belly, but for some reason this dish was meh.     7) Yaki-Soba noodles = My vegetarian friend got this since she had a hard time finding something on the menu that was vegetarian friendly.  This dish was meh according to her, and it looked meh to me as well.  The dish was at least 30% onions.  Although she ordered the dish with just vegetables, 30% onions is disappointing.   8) Black sesame ice cream = I like black sesame anything with Asian breads or desserts.  The flavor was great, but the texture was not ice cream texture.  It was instead similar to mochi.  Stretchy.  We didn't order the mochi dessert.  Perhaps there was mix up with our order.  Who knows.  Note to vegetarians: This place didn't seem to have many vegetarian friendly dishes.  There are dishes you may think are vegetarian, such as the Agedashi tofu.  The issue with some of these dishes is the use of fish stock.  Hence my friend was limited to the Yaki-Soba with 30% onions and the Korokke.  Ambiance (8.5/10) = The decor was very inviting.  A lot of elements of wood/bamboo.  There are lanterns, and the place is well lit.  Very spacious, very clean, with several private booths in the back.  Service (8.0/10) = Timely, and not overbearing.  Our waiter was nice, and provided great recommendations, such as the Squid and King Oyster Mushroom dish.  Overall opinion = Definitely a winner if you enjoy Japanese food.  The Japanese food scene (non-Sushi type Japanese restaurants) is minimal in Pittsburgh, but at least there is one good one - Teppanyaki Kyoto.  I recommend the first 5 dishes I listed above.  The rest were just meh.",

There are certain little things that are too expensive, impractacle, or uncustomary for a Japanese restaurant to do in America, but otherwise this restaurant does their level-best to honor the Japanese culinary tradition.  The restaurant is still relatively new, and they're improving. Service has occasionally been less than perfect, but some of the servers are truly outstanding. The kitchen staff is typically very personable, and the owner is always on hand.  My advice is to go during the week and sit at the bar. It's more expensive to order small plates, but worthwhile.",

The prices are comparable to other Japanese restaurants in the city as well--that is to say don't expect to find any bargains here.  The stand out dish of my evening was the bacon-wrapped mochi--the crispy bacon combined with soft mochi are great contrasts. The flounder cooked in a miso sauce does not go well with its oddly paired side of ponzu sauce. The takoyaki was good. I would not recommend the onigiri, nor the yaki onigiri.

The FLOUNDER special was a huge disappointment and I think the chefs overlooking us could see it on our faces.  It was a soggy mess that came to us in foil covered under equally soggy vegetables.  We could definitely taste it was a frozen fillet and it tasted like a failed recipe I made a while ago in my own kitchen.      Service was good and very attentive.  Overall I would only stop by here for the okonomiyaki, I would probably not try my luck again with anything else on the menu.",

    "text": "Slowly but surely, I am surprisingly discovering a handful of authentic and awesome Japanese restaurants located in Pennsylvania. After seeing okonomiyaki as a staple on Teppanyaki's menu, I knew a visit while in Pittsburgh was a must!   Following the advice of Yelp, we made reservations for a Saturday night, but ended not needing them since the place was mostly empty when we arrived. We were seated at the bar (where you can watch the chefs prepare the orders) and ordered the gyoza appetizer, a pork yaki-udon (noodles), and custom okonomiyaki. All three dishes were flavorful and fresh! Even with the additional wait for the okonomiyaki, it was a very enjoyable meal.  The only downside was when we left. We were the last two customers at the restaurant around 9:15-30PM, and they were hustling us out the door. I checked online beforehand and after, and Yelp/Google confirmed their closing time on Saturday to be 10:30PM. I am not sure if this was a special circumstance where they were closing early, but we felt very rushed. Even as we left, someone mistook us for arriving customers and shouted \"WE ARE CLOSED!\"",

    "text": "I'm not familiar with Japanese food except for sushi. I decided to give this restaurant a try because it's nearby and I was curious to know what okonomiyaki was.   I arrived at the restaurant not too long after it opened and I was seated at the counter with a full view of the grill and the meals being prepared on it. The restaurant was nice, clean and spacious. My waiter was very kind and attentive.    For a starter, I had a glass of Spanish wine and bacon wrapped mochi. This was my first time eating mochi and it was very chewy.It could've been wrapped in more slices of bacon instead of one.   For my entree, I ordered okonomiyaki, Osaka style (shrimp, squid and pork). The top of my okonomiyaki had flakes that were swaying on it. I know it was the heat causing the flakes to move, but it was nice to pretend that the flakes were dancing along with the soft music playing in the restaurant. I don't know why okonomiyaki is referred to as a \"pancake\" because it doesn't look like any pancake I've eaten before. It looks more like a casserole.   I had mochi green tea ice cream for dessert. I thought I was going to get a huge heaping serving of ice cream, but what was presented to me looked like a tennis ball sliced into quarters with a touch of whipped cream in the center. The mochi actually tasted better with the green tea ice cream.  I am very pleased with the meal and excellent service I had at Teppanyaki Kyoto. I will be coming back in the future to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "As far as I know, this is the only place where you can get okonomiyaki in or around Pittsburgh, and done very well at that. The ingredients are all right--some people may find that they use too much cabbage or the inside is too bland, but I think the amount of sauce is seasoning is perfect. The seafood and meat inside come in generous helpings as well, and everything is super flavorful. Definitely more than enough for one person, and as you cut into it the whole thing stays together instead of breaking into pieces.  Their menu on the whole is super cute and they have quite a large selection otherwise. I don't think you can go wrong with the fish appetizers; I also remember the broiled salmon to be quite nice. Finally I've tried the oden with the beef tendon stew, both of which come from the winter menu. This item really is suited for a cold winter night--a hearty stew with all sorts of different fish cakes, many of which I had never seen before.  The ambiance is very nice and clean, and I like how they have smaller tables toward the front, larger tables toward the back, and a bar / counter area where you can watch the chefs work their magic. The decor is quite traditional and really contributes to the dining experience. Finally, the waiters and chefs all make you feel welcome as soon as you walk in.",

I'm a huge takoyaki lover so finally finding a place in Pittsburgh that has them is a blessing. They're very known locally for their okonomiyaki dishes, but to me they are okay. I would get it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I find that it has a bit too much batter for my tastes. The hiyayako is surprisingly light and refreshing. I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I did. The mackerel is delicious. It's so simple, yet so well done and seasoned. I don't have any True negatives about this restaurant, but I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 simply because my expectations were a bit higher with their specialty dishes. If you like Japanese cuisine, it's a good idea to give this place a honest try.   They have a lot of good dishes, many of which I probably haven't even tried yet.",

We made a reservation, which we found out we really didn't need to since it wasn't very busy on a Sunday night. We ordered gyoza, takoyaki, miso ramen, beef okonomiyaki, squid hiroshimayaki, and unagi donburi. We were incredibly happy with the appetizers and were getting our appetites ready for some more scrumptious Japanese food. We were a little disappointed at the entrees. The pancakes weren't what we were expecting, the pancake didn't leave you wanting more. There are huge portions where a pancake could easily feed two people, but four of us couldn't finish the beef pancake. The pancake was interesting but there were too much cabbage and the beef seemed to be pureed instead of being cut into strips or pieces.   I don't regret going and I'll probably go again but not for the pancakes...",

And it was a bit busy so we sat at the booth in front of the place they make the food. It was so interesting to see how they make it. Also, we were really hungry so we kinda binge ordered (takoyaki, koroke, okonomiyaki, and yakisoa), took two rice balls togo, and had lychee ice cream and mango mochi. We were expecting around 60-70 but all that together came out to be $48. ITS SO CHEAP AND THE QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD. And the waitress was super nice and patient cause we had a lot of questions. I definitely recommend!   You might want to call ahead just to get your name on the waitlist just in case there is a wait. There were people who came after us that had to wait a bit but we called ahead so we were able to get in right away.",

We had, Fried Squid tentacles ($7) - small starter, great with beer and sake. Raw Octopus Salad with wasabi ($4) - got what I expected.  It was great. Hiyayako Tofu ($4) - it's not bad, it's just \"I-should-have-READ-the-menu\".  It is \"tofu with chinese mustard pickles and spicy chili on top\".  The chinese mustard pickles are like a dollar per pack at Chinese grocery store.  The spicy chili can also be found in Chinese grocery store (\"spicy chili crisp\" / ).  So yes, you can totally DIY this at home. octopus balls ($7) - the highlight of the night.  We had this in Hong Kong before, but they certainly do it better here.  Highly recommended.  BTW, the order comes with 6 balls.  Hiroshimayaki with oysters ($10+$3) - my first thought was that I added $3 for 2 oysters...  well, consider an oyster is like $1 from the east coast and $2 from the west, then $3 was correctly about 2 oysters.  Am I suppose to add multiple types of meat?   The teriyaki sauce they used is certainly on the sweeter side.  Be prepared for a sweet dinner. Too bad they don't have the green-tea cheesecake that night.  Certainly will be back to try that.  Overall, it was not too expensive.  Great atmosphere and not too loud.  Great with friends or a date.",

The dishes I've tried a bit like tapas- most dishes were too small for one, so we ended up ordering a bunch:  - Takoyaki: deep-fried here. A little skimpy on the octopus, but OK - Grilled eggplant: loved the miso-BBQ sauce that goes with it, decent portions - Korokke: good vegetarian option! Kinda like a Japanese samosa if you aren't familiar - Hanbaggu steak: a ground meat patty with a special sauce without the bun; OK option - Hiroshimayaki: like the Okonomiyaki except you get a layer of yakisoba noodles  Topped off with a Sapporo.",

Wait time: No wait since we had reservations. I recommend making reservations since the place isn't that big and I've heard that it gets quite busy.   Service: Great service. The waitress was very attentive and made sure our glasses were constantly filled, and asked if we were doing okay.   Appetizers/Small dishes: Takoyaki - it was okay; not crispy enough and a bit too mushy inside. Tori no kara-age (boneless fried chicken) - just okay; still not crispy enough and felt a bit oily. Saba no shioyaki (grilled mackerel with salt) - it was good but the piece was too small for $7. I expected it to be a decent size, but it was smaller than my hand.   Main dish: Okonomiyaki - not crispy enough and the sauce was too salty. I was really expecting the okonomiyaki to be great, but I've had better and this didn't really satisfy my craving. Yaki-Udon with chicken - it was fine, nothing could go wrong with this since it's a simple stir-fry.   Dessert: Green tea cheesecake - it was okay...the flavor was sorta strange since it tasted mostly like matcha powder. Green tea ice cream - yes, perfect!  Cost: Prices were pretty normal for Japanese food.   Ambience: Casual, kid-friendly, group-friendly.   Overall: I was disappointed since I read great reviews. I thought the service was great but the food was a bit disappointing. I enjoyed the green tea ice cream the most.",

    "text": "A savoury grilled blend of cabbage, flour and bacon topped with bonito flakes, mayo and okonomiyaki sauce. That, my friends is the quintessential okonomiyaki. It's a sure classic in Japanese street food. How Pittsburgh didn't have another okonomiyaki joint before this, I cannot fathom, but Teppanyaki Kyoto makes the classic dish ohhh so sexy.   The restaurant serves a variety of other casual Japanese fare, such as rice bowls and noodle dishes, but who are we kidding, the okonomiyaki is the star dish. We tried the gyudon and it was alright - nothing too special to note. But the okonomiyaki, oh man, it was some hunk of goodness. We trekked far and wide to come to this place (it's hidden in a small neighbourhood quite far away from CMU campus) and were forewarned of the 25 minute wait, but all our worries were washed away when we dined on the okonomiyaki. I've had better for far cheaper in New York, but this is the only okonomiyaki joint in Pittsburgh. My hunger for this fat, succulent dish could no longer wait. And skimp they did not.  They're quite adventurous on their okonomiyaki too. You can opt for the regular or the hiroshimayaki (similar to okonomiyaki, but with yakisoba noodles below and a fried egg on top) and even add extra toppings for additional cost. Not sure if the authentic experience in Japan would be this liberal on the toppings, but hey, I wouldn't mind a cheesy kimchi okonomiyaki.  tl;dr: eat here, the okonomiyaki is so worth it.",

    "text": "This restaurant is tucked away in a small side street but the food here is very authentic and delicious.  They specialize in okonomiyaki but they also serve other classic Japanese dishes and interesting appetizers.    The bacon wrapped mochi is amazing, warm/salty/savory and not too heavy.  Definitely get it.  The takoyaki are little flour balls with seafood filing on the inside, crunchy on the outside but soft and warm on the inside.  We got the scallop/squid/shrimp okonomiyaki which was delicious and appropriately portioned to be shared by several adults.  It comes with a nice pan/spoon utensil to help you chop it up into pieces.  Watching the fish flakes move around in the air is always interesting!  Service was fast and friendly, the servers/owners are actually Japanese.  Price is extremely reasonable, we spent about $50 for 3 people sharing varies appetizers and entrees.  Their menu changes itself seasonally so some of the pictures you see on yelp of food may not actually be served in the restaurant (I was looking for the black sesame ice cream but they weren't serving it when I went)  Drinks: I got a 150ml bottle of unfiltered sake for $6 and it was well worth it.  They also have a variety of sweet sake and Japanese beers.  Con: No sushi or fresh fish here so don't expect to have sashimi.",

    "text": "Okonomiyaki! I've had a long history of curiosity over this particular dish, ever since reading Ranma 1/2 in elementary school. So yup. Many years later, I finally decide that since I won't get any closer to Japan than Narita airport any time soon, it's time to just go ahead and try it in Pittsburgh, since it looked promising enough...  While I can't comment on authenticity, I did enjoy the 2 my friend and I tried. We did the kyoto mix and the hiroshimayaki, and both were very tasty - the batter kind of reminds me of korean seafood pancake in a way, but made different with the topping and sauces. Their pricing on the menu is a little confusing the way it's written, but meat is an extra $2 - both ours were $12 each, and for the size, it might be a little expensive since they're not quite meals on their own. Plus, the $2 portion of meat was quite meager for an extra charge. But taste wise, yay!  We were most impressed by the takyoyaki though - though I've only ever had mediocre ones that were quite doughy. These were smaller, but had a nice dough:octopus ratio, and the texture was very pleasant - crispy on the outside, soft but not mushy on the inside.   Low points:  We wanted to snack on some onigiri while we waited the listed 25min for our mains, but the rice was plain and not seasoned and $2 each so I would skip these.  Matcha cheesecake had the worst dry texture and didn't taste of green tea at all... or anything besides just cream cheese. Too much cream cheese. We didn't finish our tiny slice. Service was very slow - friendly, but understaffed. The restaurant isn't huge, but it certainly takes more than 1 waiter and one foodrunner to man the whole place, which is what it seemed like was happening. Poor kid.   Enjoyable meal, highs an lows. Good enough for novelty's sake, but I wouldn't return often since it's a bit expensive for what you get. Worth at least a try or two though! A high 3/low 4 stars I guess",

    "text": "I went here twice during this past winter. It took me two times to figure out my feelings on this place. I studied in Japan for a year. While I was there, I prized myself as a bit of a foodie. One of my favorites was okonomiyaki, in particular Hiroshimayaki.  Between the two times I went to Teppanyaki Kyoto, I got the Hiroshimayaki and a mixture of their appetizers:  takoyaki, crochets, those rice cakes with bacon and gyoza. The appetizers were fine, but the crochets were frozen and not made from scratch. It seems a bit funny to be paying do much for frozen food ...  Hiroshimayaki is a Hiroshima's take on okonomiyaki. Rather than mixing the ingredients during preparation, the ingredients are layered with soba or udon noodles and then steamed instead of fried. Ideally, Hiroshimayaki is much lighter in taste than its Osaka cousin. Here the Hiroshimayaki was so heavy it made my stomach ache, and the pork was a little too gristly for my tastes.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, I just don't think I will go again.",

    "text": "I ate here a few Thursdays ago for dinner with my girlfriend.  We had actually tried to go here the Thursday before with a friend but were turned away since the whole restaurant was reserved for a rehearsal dinner.  After entering the restaurant we were asked if we would like to sit at a table or the bar and choose the table while in hindsight I wish that we had chosen the bar.  The reason that I say this is that you could watch the food being made if you sit at the bar while we did not have as good of a view from our seats.  As a whole the restaurant looked nice and clean place and had some good Japanese music playing in the background.  My girlfriend and I decided to start off dinner with the octopus ball appetizer.  It was surprisingly good with the outside of the ball being crunchy while the inside was creamy and contained a surprisingly large piece of octopus.  For our entrees I decided to get order one of their specialties, the Hokkaido Okonomiyaki while my girlfriend had a noodle dish.  On the menu there is a note that the Okonomiyaki take 25 minutes to cook which was not a problem for us.  My entree consisted of a Japanese wheat pancake covered in Japanese mayonnaise, seaweed powder and bonito flakes and stuffed underneath with a bunch of different seafood and cabbage.  Overall I enjoyed the taste of it as it was something that I had never had before.  It looked nice visually with the orange mayonnaise and had a bunch of different textures from the crispy cabbage to the soft pancake and thin bonito flakes.  Even though I did not do it myself I would recommend that you scrape some of the mayo off of the top as there does seem to be quite a bit of it.  My girlfriends dish also had a nice taste to it and I enjoyed it as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future.  The restaurant itself has a nice feel to it, the staff was incredibly pleasant and I really enjoyed getting some good food that I am not sure you can get elsewhere in the city.  It was also much cheaper than expected which both my girlfriend and myself were happy about.",

    "text": "I thought Salt was in the East End?!  Spending a lot of time Korea the wife and I definitely like Japanese comfort food.  There is no shortage of trendy Japanese places in Seoul and to mix t up we tried a bunch while living there.  Teppanyaki has to be my favorite type of Japanese fare with the exception of maybe Yakitori.    Ok, now that I've established some prior knowledge I'll review the restaurant.  The place is small and gets pretty noisy, we had a group of 9 including 5 kindergarten age children sitting next to us.  I swear this did not negatively sway my review, but I must say we did not enjoy sitting next to them.  The decor didn't really remind me of Japan and is very minimalistic.  We didn't get any alcohol sadly since the wife is pregnant (yeah considering that prior sentence funny huh).  I got the Oolong iced tea, and was a little miffed that there weren't free refills.  Another miff was that how our food was brought out.  We ordered 2 appetizers, ramen, and okonomiyaki.  The ramen came out first, then one appetizer, then the okonomiyaki, then the other appetizer?!  Very strange and annoying.  Now the food. Miso Ramen with pork - The noodles were good, but not the best I've had, chewy though, so good enough.  The ramen comes with fish cake, scallions, bamboo shoots, and pork.  The pork was really good, the bamboo shoots were very chewy and seemed canned and old.  And now the broth, the most important part of ramen.  It was really salty and didn't have much flavor other than salt.  Sad really, because ramen can be SO incredibly good. Butaniku no shogayaki - Grilled pork with ginger sauce and onions - This was decent, again too much salt, but good.  The pork was lean and no dry.  The onions were sweet and the sauce was full of flavor.  I finished it, but needed a lot of tea and water to do so. Bacon wrapped mochi - This was the show stealer.  I'd go back just to order this.  You get two nice sized chewy rice cakes wrapped in bacon drizzled with soy sauce reduction and sprinkled with nori.  Very good dish, could have just used a little less .....SALT! Okonomiyaki - The Japanese pancake that you kind of have to get if going to a Teppanyaki place.  We got ours with pork, PORK OVERLOAD!!!  It was good, I guess...not sure what else to say other than it was decent minus the salt yet again.  The Bento flakes didn't taste fishy at all which was also disappointing.   I don't think my blood pressure could handle another visit anytime soon, so I think I will just buy Korean rice cakes and make the only dish I really enjoyed myself.",

    "text": "I went here a few weeks back with several friends.  One is Japanese and her family owns a restaurant in Japan.  Needless to say, she knows authentic Japanese cuisine so this visit was as much for her to see if this was truly authentic as it was for me to try my first Japanese pancake.  Overall, it was a solid experience,  First, the space seems very traditional and you could tell that the owners focused on the details and put a lot of effort into the design.  You first enter a reception area, then turn right to see the hibachi kitchen with a bar in front on the right and some table and chairs on the left.  As you proceed past this area, you walk up a step to an area in the back of the restaurant that has traditional Japanese seating, i.e. large tables in separate rooms with floor seating.  Overall, the decor and layout is very appealing.  But we didnt come for the decor, we came for the food.  When we first sat down, I glanced to our neighbors plates and everything looked absolutely delicious which gave me a good feeling.  And the smell was overwhelming.  There is no other way to describe it other than fresh.  Regardless of what was on the grille, it just smelled like fresh vegetables.  This too gave me a good feeling.    My wife and I started off with an appetizer and I cant remember what it was but I do remember that it was awesome. Then for our entrees, we ordered the Japanese pancakes (yaki).  They come in two styles - OkonomiYaki which is basically an open faced pancake and HiroshimaYaki which is like a sandwich.  We got one of each - OkonomiYaki in Hokaiddo style which is scallops, shrimp and some other fish and HiroshimaYaki which we got in beef.  They were both delicious.  I have never had anything like this before and it was better than I could have expected.  We followed that up with Onogiri which is a rice ball that is toasted on each side which you then wrap in nori (seaweed) and eat.  It wasn't bad but it was just toasted rice.  I will probably pass on that next time.  Then we finished with mochi for dessert.  We split mango and green tea.  Both were delicious.  After dinner the chef came out to our table and we learned that he is Korean but studied in Japan for several years.  He was very nice and I would defintely recommend to try his restaurant.  Pittsburgh has a fairly diverse selection of eateries but this kind of place was lacking.  Teppanyaki Kyoto is a welcome addtion to the scene.",

    "text": "When we visit a restaurant, the service and attitude of the staff should be a major part of the restaurant experience.  Even if the food is good, it alone cannot rate the restaurant as good one.  I read reviews of this place and wanted to give a try.  Drove 100 miles to check out the fuss about.  I am a native Japanese and know what the Okonomiyaki is although I am not an Okomoniyaki connoisseur.    I ordered 2 appetizers and 1 entree (Tokyo style Okonomiyaki).  The food was good but not notable.  One of the appetizers was served very late; while the entree was already served.  The timing was terrible and I did not want to eat the delayed appetizer so I asked for to-go.    Here are some notes.  I sat at the counter table, right in front of the teppan plate.  This is where you can see the cooking performance and some interactions with a chef, otherwise, why do they setup a counter table?  When I arrived, there were 2 guests at the counter table and they left shortly after my arrival.  I was the only one who sat the counter and I expected a few words to converse with the owner chef... I was wrong.  His unfriendliness and rude attitude completely ignored my presence.  No greeting, no smile, no comments, no inquiries how the food was.  Seriously.  It was on Sunday night, around 8:30PM.  Do I need to worry about the closing time?  I should not have to bu I got an impression from the chef that he just wanted to get the hell out of there and close.  Instead of asking how the food was, he turned himself around and started using his laptop computer, sitting just behind the kitchen.  Really?  Is it that bad to pay some attentions to what you cooked and served?    Overall, my visit to this restaurant turned out one of the worst experiences.  I could cook Okonomiyaki mix at home instead of driving a long distance.  My expectation was very high but my disappointment was greater.  I would not repeat.  This was my first and the last visit.  BTW, after I posted my disappointment on their FB page, the owner's wife or someone whoever really argued with me that there was nothing wrong with what he did.  Really?  Instead of arguing with the unhappy customer, why don't you remorse and review your attitude and try to improve?  Please don't insult the customer.  Is it because I am a Japanese?  You don't need to treat me like an enemy.  Great job, well done.",

These stars go for the takoyaki, which was as good as the dish in japan and is exceedingly rare on American Japanese menus. The stars also go for the silken Tofu, which was also as good as restaurants in Japan. This place is as authentic as it gets outside of Japan and serves traditional homestyle food. There is no americanization and we even sat on the floor with our shoes off. As it should be. As it should be.",

The service was great and the chef came right over and talked to us for a few minutes when we were done eating.  If you are looking for a cultural experience and want to try something new, I recommend this place.",

    "text": "I have never written a review before, but just for this restaurant, I will.  For my graduation dinner, I wanted my family to eat something special. Something they wouldn't be able to get living in the Bay Area (which is notoriously good for all kinds of Asian food), and also, not so busy of a place that I wouldn't be able to quietly savor the presence of my family. I'm glad Teppanyaki Kyoto is a new restaurant, because if everyone else knew how good it was, I doubt I'd have been able to get that nice quiet atmosphere!  The restaurant is very clean, and the design reminds me the time when I went to Japan, and stayed at a small bed and breakfast. The plating is very aesthetically pleasing, and typical of the Japanese \"minimalistic\" feel. I knew I was getting good Japanese food when all the people sitting around me were speaking Japanese.  The food was delicious. I have made Okonomiyaki before, and it did not taste as good as the ones here (not that that is surprising). They taste authentically Japanese ,with the kewpie mayo, okonomiyaki sauce, the seaweed, and fish flakes. I also had the sauteed scallops, which was very good. The bacon wrapped mochi was very hard to share, and very bacon-like (so if you like bacon, this is for you!) since it is very stretchy and chewy like the texture of mochi is. The appetizers, as other reviewers have said, are very small; one person could easily finish them. But when you come here, you expect the authentic Japanese experience, and you pay for quality, not quantity. I also did not leave this place hungry, since okonomiyaki, which starts at 9 to 10 dollars, is like the size of a small pizza at Uno's (but of course, much better tasting).  I talked to the chef, and apparently he's Korean, lived in Taiwan (so he could speak with my parents in Mandarin which was very cool!), but he wanted to learn Japanese cooking so much, that he went to Japan, begged the owner of the restaurant he loved there to let him train in the kitchen without pay, and learned how to cook authentic Japanese food. If you talk to him, which I'm sure he'd be happy to, he'd tell you his story. It sounds like one of those \"I worked hard and achieved my dream\" kind of stories that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.  You can tell from talking with him that he cares about the highest standard in everything he does, whether it is preparing the food, choosing the tableware (he took a trip to NY to find the best tableware), the architecture, or how to treat his customers. His shop is clean, and he doesn't hire someone else to cook in his place but instead trains just one person to cook exactly to the same standard he does. He even stops and talks with people too.  Overall, it is a great place to eat. If it was closer to where I lived, and if I wasn't a poor college student, I would be a regular here, and bring all my friends and family here. I know the owner would treat him or her just as well as he treated me and my family, and the food will be fresh and tasty.",

We had some of their skewers, okonomiyaki, gyoza and takoyaki. I really loved the okonomiyaki here but the skewers left a bit to be desired. I didn't like that you couldn't just order the specific skewers you wanted and had to order the mix.  My SO loved this place and we definitely plan on returning here.",

We arrived a few minutes early for dinner and we saw at least 4 other people get out of their cars the same time as us. Seems like a very popular place.

    "text": "What a cool little place in Pittsburgh (that I never knew existed)! Walking past, you would think it was your run of the mill Japanese sushi restaurant. Wrong. In fact, they don't have any sushi on the menu. Based on Yelp reviews as well as our waiter, Teppanyaki Kyoto is known for its Okonomiyaki, which is like a cabbage pancake. Sounds boring on paper but in actuality, it is oh so colorful, bold and flavorful. Although delicious served alone, they also offer many different add-ons ranging from different meats, veggies and seafood.   My husband and I visited on a Friday evening. We made sure to make reservations based on other reviews stating how busy they get. At 6:30 pm, the restaurant was relatively empty but quickly filled up within a matter of minutes upon our arrival. The menu was overwhelming with items we were completely unfamiliar with, but the waiter was extremely helpful and very patient as my husband and I drilled him with our newbie questions. One thing to note, they also have a seasonal menu that changes with each season! Another plus: the menu was incredibly affordable and we could sample many items without breaking the bank.   We ended up ordering Takoyaki (octopus fritters, $7), Daigaku Imo (sugar glazed fried sweet potatoes, $3), Okonomiyaki with pork ($11) and Shogayaki Don (ginger pork rice bowl, $8). We also ordered a large size of the Karatanba sake ($14). We shared everything and it was plenty for the two of us for under $50. My favorite would definitely be the Okonomiyaki for its amazing savory blend of flavors: it was sweet from the cabbage, salty and savory from the Okonomiyaki sauce, lightly creamy from the drizzle of mayo and smoky from the bonita fish flakes. When it came out, we noticed the cool movement of the fish flakes. It looked alive, but trust me, it wasn't. The Takoyaki (octopus fritters) had a very similar taste to the Okonomiyaki since it was topped with the same ingredients but the fritter dough seemed a bit dense. Although good, I probably wouldn't order this again for the sake of trying other items from the menu. The Shogayaki Don (ginger pork rice bowl) was comforting, savory and slightly sweet. And the sweet potatoes were very much like dessert, being sweet themselves and covered in a sugar syrup. Luckily, they came out last for us and was a perfect sweet ending to our meal.  I absolutely cannot wait to come back here and try more items from the menu! I can't speak on the authenticity of their food but I certainly can say that you can't find another place serving this type of Japanese cuisine in Pittsburgh.",

The interior and overall ambience is pretty authentic, which is something I don't usually see in other Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh.   I got the takoyaki for appetizer and yakisoba. The takoyaki was really good, and made fresh, so they were served steaming hot with little octopus pieces in them. I also really liked the yakisoba! When the portion is huge and I don't end up with leftovers, you know it's good (: My boyfriend got the fried mackerel with rice and liked it too! Not too salty or bland.

We had two dishes, one of which was a pork dish with onions and cabbage in a ginger sauce, good. The second dish was the real standout though: the Okonomiyaki is delicious. We got it with egg and beef. I imagine it'd be tasty even without the supplements, but I'd recommend getting one or two. Okonomiyaki is a wheat pancake with cabbage beneath it and some tasty flavoring on top. There's quite a large portion for the price. This is a real Japanese restaurant, doing Japanese ratios--that means that the Okonomiyaki is more about the cabbage and the pancake than the meat, but it is delicious and filling.  The desserts are yummy too--we had a matcha cheesecake slice and a mochi wrapped inside an oak leaf. The desserts are small but reasonably priced.  The server was a bit hard to get a hold of but friendly and did seem to be working hard. And parking is a nightmare--that's just a Highland Park thing.",

Everything tastes very sincere and hearty, and didn't fail to sate my ever growing appetite.   We came for the big pancake teppanyaki kyoto was known for but they didn't make it for lunch. So if you're looking to get that, come during dinner time!   However, there was a silver lining. Their lunch sets were fairly priced and comes with miso soup and salad to go with your main course.   Overall, I'd say teppanyaki kyoto is another hidden gem in Pittsburgh. Pay this place a visit if you're ever in the mood for some japanese home food, you won't regret it!",

They grill the shrimp and avocado and flavor it with Wasabi Soy sauce. Takoyaki - A little small but tastes like what a takoyaki is supposed to taste like. Okonomyaki Kyoto Mix (Corn, Mochi, Tofu) - made with lots of cabbage with some people may not like but I really like it Japanese Curry with Chicken Cutlet - delicious curry with crispy chicken Yaki Soba - This was okay. A little bit bitter for some reason. Kamo Rosu - Pan-roasted Duck Breast Japanese Cheesecake -  not a big fan of cheesecake in general but this was really light. Had texture more like cake than cheesecake.",

    "text": "I love the layout of the restaurant and I love the authenticity. There are traditional floor seatings in the back for larger groups and I highly recommend taking advantage of this unique offer for the whole feel. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. For someone who is unfamiliar with Japanese cuisines, like myself, the foreign names on the menu could be a little daunting.   For appetizers, we got the \"Takoyaki squid balls\" ($7), recommended by the waiter. I love that the squid balls were actually filled with chunks of real squid. The order came with 6, drizzled with some teriyaki sauce and sprinkled with fish flakes.   The next item we tried was a noodle dish, \"yaki-udon\" with beef ($11). The udon had a nice chewy texture and smoked flavor, but it was too ordinary. Tasted like something I could throw together myself.   Next to arrive was the \"okonomiyaki pancake\" Hokkaido mix with squid, shrimp and scallops ($12). In my opinion, this was the most bang for your buck. They were super generous on the seafood and the portion. It was made fresh and still sizzling as it arrived at our table.   Like every dinning experience, there are hits and there are misses. In honor of spring, we decided to give the seasonal menu a try with the scallops and shrimps \"hoiru-yaki\" ($12, seasonal). The description called for a creamy basil sauce, but what we got was a bland and watery liquid mixed with basil. The presentation lacked sophistication in that thrown-together, crumbled-up foil tray. The whole dish was just bleh. I would never order this again in the future.   For dessert we inhaled the green tea mochi ($2), which melted away all my sorrows, and the lychee sherbet ($3), which was packed with flavors.   Despite the misses, my dinning experience here was phenomenal. For those seeking a more authentic dinning experience at very reasonable prices, I highly recommend giving Teppanyaki a chance. The service was top notch and the food was quality. If you are a noob to Japanese food like myself and is overwhelmed with the menu, I narrowed down my favorites: the \"takoyaki\" squid balls, \"okonomiyaki\" pancakes and the green tea mochi.",

I live a few blocks and make it here regularly, especially in the winter.   The atmosphere is very Japanese, even the menu has the bright ,fun vibe to it. For such a small place there's lots of different seating options, from more private, to floor seating, to my favorite of sitting right by the griddle.   I love duck, and the kamo-rosu really lets it shine. The takoyaki almost always makes it to our table. The real reason to head here, though, the the okonomiyaki and hiroshimayaki. I've had it other places since, but this is still my go-to.   The staff is always friendly and efficient, and watching them cook is a real treat.",

You will find items you recognize--kara-age (the best, here), takoyaki (also the best I've ever had)--but the real highlight are their seasonal menus and their namesake, the teppanyaki, front and center in the restaurant. On this visit, we shared Kara-age and takoyaki, as well as two seasonal dishes for summer 2018:  bang-bang chicken (a cold dish, reminiscent of a chicken salad, on a bed of quick-pickled, thinly sliced onions) and hiyashi ramen (a cold ramen soup with pork, matchstick vegetables, egg and tomatoes).  All of their food is cooked to perfection. Their service is fast and thorough. If you are new to this type of Japanese food, your server can direct you, based on preferences and comfort level. And, you need to try the signature dishes:  okonomiyaki and hiroshimayaki. These hearty dishes (only during dinner service), layer protein of your choice, cabbage and other fillings in a thin batter. Noodles are a regional addition, in the case of hiroshimayaki Pancake-like, they cone topped with rich sauces and bonito.",

But, its definitely worth it.   I went there with a group of friends and three of us shared food. Something we do often to give ourselves the chance to try multiple foods from the restaurants we visit. Here, after looking at multiple reviews we decided to go with the following:  1. Seaweed Salad for appetizer. The taste was very good. It was salty with a nice soy like salad dressing. If you don't like slimy food then you might not love it. Otherwise, I think its definitely a must try. Its different if you didn't have seaweed before.  For main dishes we got:  2. Tapoyaki, a small dish of Octopus balls. The best taste and most delicious. It was a fantastic blend of octopus meat and other ingredients. It is a must try in my opinion. The potion is a little small so make sure this is not the only thing you are ordering if you are too hungry.   3. We tried the Okonomyaki which Teppanyaki Kyoti is actually famous for. It was definitely a very tasty. Its a pancake style food with mix of cooked veggies, pancakes and meat. You have many options for toppings for extra. We tried it with shrimp and oyster and it was a great mix. I would for sure suggest it.  4. The last meal of ours was Chicken Katsu Kare. It was a nice Kare but it wasn't anything different or new. It was a fairly simple Kare and very similar to indian food. The taste was nice and good but I felt there more exciting meals to try. However, I should say the portion was really good.   For desert we got the cheese cake and the Kushi-Dango. Both were great but I personally loved the Kushi Dango. Not too sweet but yet very tasty.   I definitely would suggest this restaurant and visit here more often.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to check out Teppanyaki Kyoto for awhile now, since we discovered it while we were dining across the street at Park Bruges. We were reminiscing about our trip to Japan last year and wanted to have some okonomiyaki to ease our nostalgia.   As we stepped into the restaurant, it was as if we were being transported to Japan. The ambiance, smells, music, everything made us feel like we have left Pittsburgh entirely. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, in a little private section, which we really didn't mind, though the hostess did give us the option to sit wherever we wanted as we were tempted by the seats on the floor in the tatami room for a few seconds.   For food, we ordered a plate of takoyaki to start. We didn't take long to place our order for our main course as we were starving and on the menu, it stated that it would take 25 minutes to prepare the okonomiyaki. The takoyaki was served very quickly and it tasted pretty good, very close to what we had in Japan.    ~25 minutes later, my hokkaido mix (shrimp, scallop and squid) okonomiyaki and my husband's beef hiroshimayaki arrived. The difference between the okonomiyaki and hiroshimayaki is that the hiroshimayaki has soba noodles in it and  a fried egg on top. The 2 pancakes looked delicious and were surprisingly large and filling. I was a little disappointed in my okonomiyaki because I realized it was thick, because it was packed with cabbage. My seafood okonomiyaki, had 1 shrimp, 2 nscallops, and maybe 3 slices of squid. For the price, I can't complain, and it was still tasty nonetheless.   Our waiter was also very attentive and kept checking on us to make sure our glasses were always filled.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience.",

I've always loved the \"izakaya\" tradition, and this place brings it on - strong.  We were here a few weeks ago, and I was delighted to see the one thing that I thought had been missing from their menu: a yakitori sampler plate. We ordered one for our table, and were not disappointed. I would absolutely love it if they would expand this offering with a classic robata binchotan grill along the bar eating area, and serve an even more diverse selection of tasty skewers.  Our favorites here are still the takoyaki, the okonomiyaki, and an amazing dish called \"butaniku no shogayaki\" which is tasty thin slices of pork and onions with a light teriyaki/garlic sauce. It's awesome. That being said, we have never had anything here that was short of delicious. Another great part of the menu are the Japanese beers and a large selection of sake, anything you could possibly want! We'll keep coming back!!!",

Kevin the owner is a gracious host, always friendly and always quick with a smile.  He and his team of young chefs will from time to time change things up a bit.  This is nice because some restaurants we know will keep the same menu for years.  What we love about Kyoto is that all the dishes are freshly made, not too salty, everything just right.  The service is friendly and fast.  Everything is clean and professional, open kitchen gives me a good feeling for cleanliness.  The place is popular and does get crowded so... keep that in mind.  Nevertheless, even when you have to wait, it is worth it!",

I love how quaint this restaurant is and the fact that they don't serve sushi is awesome. It's not your typical Japanese restaurant.  They're actually known for their okonomiyaki. I remember the first time I came here and ordered the okonomiyaki, I freaked out because the bonito flakes were moving! I seriously was like, what the hell is that? And the waitress assured me that it wasn't alive and that the flakes are so thin that when exposed to heat or steam it moves around. *whew*  My husband and I split the okonomiyaki (Hiroshima style) with shrimp and ordered the dashi maki, soba, takoyaki, and the yaki onigiri.  Would love to come back to try other dishes and sit by the hibachi! Try their Japanese beer! It's refresshing! Kanpai!!",

We sat at the bar section, and we watched the chef's craft amazing dishes for everyone that was there. Sit at the bar, and enjoy the show and take in those wonderful smells coming from the griddle.  The okonomiyaki tastes like what you'll get in the finest shops in Japan. The korokke was nicely fried, and the takoyaki was scrumptious. For dessert we got the macha cheesecake, and typically I steer away from macha anything. But the flavor was subtle, and it was the perfect dessert for such a wonderful meal.  The service was outstanding, and if you're craving real authentic Japanese food (outside of sushi and ramen), this is the spot to go to. I can't wait to come back and try the yakitori, the yaki-soba, and the hanbaagu steak.",

Small space inside makes for a pretty intimate feel. We sat at a table with some bamboo overhead, which was kind of fun and well-themed. Very friendly service!  My fiance and I got the famous pancake that the restaurant is known for - Okonomiyaki. It's a mix of cabbage, noodle, egg, whatever meats you add (for $1-3 dollars each), and is topped with fish flakes. Very good flavor and an interesting dish! Haven't ever had this kind of thing before, which made it fun. The base pancake with no add-ins is just $11.  We also got a chicken katsu plate (I am surely spelling it wrong). This was more or less chicken and gravy, but with Asian-style, curry-flavored gravy, on a large bed of white rice. So very basic on one hand, but on the other hand kind of an interesting take on chicken and gravy. Pretty filling, only $13.  They have 12oz bottles of Sapporo for just $5.",

We got the tatami floor room towards the back of the restaurant and sat on the floor with cushions. That didn't phase me at all honestly, I'm used to it.  The waiter was super super nice and he made sure that we were all taken care of. We ordered a bunch of small plates here and there to share with everyone. The takoyaki was so super delicious but they were all really good. As an entree we got the chicken katsu kare and I have to say, it was really mediocre. I guess you can't really do anything fancy to the dish, but it was the same as what I could make at home.  We also got a pork okonomiyaki and that was really good. Too much cabbage but it was cooked well and hot.  I think the best part was the matcha cheesecake. Unfortunately they didn't have enough for the entire party because they only make a set amount each day, but that was fine because not everyone wanted a slice anyways. But it was so so good. They also bring out ice cream with a candle for birthdays.  It was a lot of fun and the experience and atmosphere was unlike a lot of restaurants here in Pittsburgh. Though the food wasn't WOWOWOWOW, I don't regret choosing this place for his birthday.",

    "text": "OVERALL: great Japanese place famous for their okonomiyaki (type of Japanese grilled pancake). Be prepared to wait if you order okonomiyaki because it takes a while to make, especially with a large group. Traditional setting with comfortable seating. A tad pricey, but makes sense.  At Teppanyaki Kyoto, the food is very authentic and the okonomiyaki was definitely an experience. As someone trying it for the first time, I thought it had an interesting flavor, but I liked it, and would be down to try other versions of it. The wait was long (about 40 mins), but it makes sense because of my group of 6 people. I also tried the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) appetizer, which was delicious, but portion size was a bit small.  I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Japanese food, because it's one of the best places I've found in Pittsburgh so far. Also, you have to try the okonomiyaki - it's quite unique, and I haven't found any other place here that makes it.",

    "text": "One of the best authentic Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh!  I just recently moved to Pittsburgh from Orange County, California. It's been hard finding authentic Japanese food, until I found this restaurant. You get the most legitimate type of izakaya Japanese food on the menu, ranging from yakitori, dashi-maki, takoyaki, yaki soba, etc. The portion size is a little small, depending on what you get, but its expected when you're dining in at a izakaya-style restaurant. Depending on what you get, the food takes some time as well, but worth it.  The employees are lively, greeting you in Japanese, and they make great recommendations when it comes to the food and drink.  The different type of Japanese drinks they have is pretty impressive. They have an extensive alcohol list, with different types of Japanese sake, beer, and whiskey. They even Hibiki whiskey, which is awesome.  Its not the best tasting izakaya food I've ever had, but when you don't have a lot of authentic food option, its the best option you'll get in Pittsburgh.",

Teppanyaki is like hibachi in a way (metal cook top) but much more regionally specific. I would recommend sitting at the bar in front of the grill if possible.   The menu is probably not what you are familiar with however it clearly explains what every dish is, and is also very seasonally specific with lots of pictures. All of the appetizers are very approachable and shareable which I would recommend. Entrees have a very home cooked feel and fill you up! They provide chop sticks but don't feel shy about asking for a fork if you're not adept with chop sticks.   At its core this is comfort food and you will leave full and happy!",

What I've eaten: -takoyaki is made incredibly well. Crispy on the outside, fluffy inside. They could certainly use more octopus. Sauces that go on top are well-balanced and pair well with takoyaki. - Salt-grilled mackerel is probably my favorite. It's seasoned so well, is always mouth-watering, I always have to share half (all) of it with my dates (I get the bones...) - yakisoba is sweet and savory. Noodles are cooked well, but overall I think the flavor is a bit generic i.e. nothing special. To me this is more of a comfort food  Things I liked: -Everything above about food is great -They have an open kitchen so it's fun watching them cook their dishes  Things I didn't like: -can be pricey for portion sizes, but whatever it's Japanese in mid-west.",

For our party of 7, the waitress only gave us 3 menus and no water. We had to keep flagging her or any other worker down to remind them to bring us more and also glasses of water. It seemed like she was the only waitress on the floor; she could use a little help! We had to keep calling servers over to take our order, as none seemed to approach us.  Tip: order the okonomiyaki first. It takes 25 min to make, but it's worth it! Also, the Hiroshimayaki is another dish that takes a while to make, but it tasted pretty similar to the okonomiyaki so just pick one!  The wait time for the food was not bad as the servers brought out the dishes when they were ready. The portion sizes and flavor were impressive. I'm pleasantly surprised to have found a decent Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh! The prices weren't too bad either, although one cup of green tea was $2, so I'd be wary of that.   Other than the experience with the servers, everything was up to par. I would come back for the food, maybe order through grubhub or postmates, but maybe not so much for the service.",

I ordered a pretty complete set from the menu: (sorry I forgot most of the Japanese names) - Fried potato cakes: mushy inside, which I guess is intentional but it didn't hold up well, and the texture was just too loose to taste anything. Also, the potato paste inside was too thin, and the breading on the outside didn't hold up very well. 1.5/5 - Octopus balls: Main reason to come here for me. The presentation was great, but the flavor was too salty and I felt that where the food could be savory it was somehow suppressed. Still, good amount of octopus. Didn't really like the filling though, for the same reason as the fried potato cake filling: too thin. 3/5. - Yakisoba: Presentation was not that great, because colors were really dulled and nothing was shiny. Flavor honestly was actually okay, but the chicken tasted like buffet quality, and veggies felt kinda forced---they were too soggy and contrasted with the slightly harder and dry noodles. 3/5. - Filet: Presentation was decent, but the meat quality was basically the worst you could get for filet. The meat was not tender at all and really overcooked. Also not a fan of the wasabi sauce they used---it was really strong and drowned out any meat/bbq sauce flavor. 2/5. - Green tea mochi dessert: Rice flour was not fresh, and insides were average. 3/5.  Really disappointing meal for me, and with better balance of flavors and higher quality ingredients, this restaurant could improve by a bunch.",

The octopus in the takoyaki and squid in the okonomiyaki were cooked to the point where they were rubbery and hard to eat. My friend got the teppanyaki with shrimp and I sampled her dish. The shrimp seemed like it had been pre-cooked and then added when the teppanyaki was being made. On top of that, we had to wait for a long time to get seated even though the waitress kept on saying that we would be seated in ten-fifteen minutes.",

They don't have sushi, but they have lots of other things that I've been hard-pressed to find elsewhere, like okonomiyaki (they're known for it), daigaku imo, amezake, and so forth. They have a seasonal menu that changes... seasonally, and it's always worth a look. They also have stuff you can find more easily at other Japanese restaurants like yakisoba, ramen, gyuudon if you want something more familiar (that isn't sushi) but still better than average.",

I also had the strawberry mousse for dessert, which was very good. My friend also tried the Japanese bacon mochi appetizer and green team mochi for dessert. I highly recommend you give it a try.

One appetizer is really meant for one, (or two if you are intimate with someone.)  The seaweed salad was crunchy and yummy.  The bacon wrapped mochi cake was a bit of savory lusciousness.  I guess everything is better with bacon!  My friend K. got the miso which was homemade, fresh and cleansing.  The pork dish I got as an entree was less memorable than the appetizers, but the vegetable entree that my friend R. ordered looked so great and healthy, I couldn't help but steal a few bites.  Wonderful!  I had only 2 caveats.  First, the waitress would not let us sit at a table, only at the front counter.  It was lovely to talk to our chefs, but difficult to talk to one another.  I think it was just a cultural misunderstanding.  I am sure the best seats are at the counter in Japan.  The other caveat, it is not a cheap, however, for real Japanese faire, with fresh ingredients, tastefully made, it's worth a little extra.    For a lunch that is flavorful, memorable and you can walk away from feeling healthier than when you got there, you cannot go wrong frequenting this little gem.",

When you first step in and see chefs dicing cucumbers to lightly stirfry you assume you're in for the same experience, but after my dish I felt like I had eaten a bowling ball.  (I normally have a pretty cast iron stomach, so take heed)  This was my first teppanyaki experience, so I can't compare it to other places, but while the food was tasty it was absolutely SOAKED in mayonnaise, it felt like a mayonnaise casserole.  Me and my family all got different styles of their signature teppanyaki dishes but they are wall the same mayo bathes.  Despite that, I'm still going to give them 4 stars, because I believe my problem is actually with teppanyaki, not a criticism of their preparation of it.  (No one could justifiable criticize a restaurants fried chicken for being a bit heavy)  The appetizers  (especially the bacon wrapped mochi) were all delicious and much lighter, so when I go back I'm going to stick to those instead!",

I've learned to hardly look at the menu and put our trust in the waiting staff who will treat you like family. Everything they recommend they do so with extreme pride and results which live up to the hype. I first came here on a quiet evening and was shocked at just how delicious and fresh everything was. Next, my husband and I brought a good friend of ours who had just returned from a semester abroad in Japan - she vouched for the authenticity but said that even she would've been hard-pressed to find something this good on the streets of Tokyo. Then, we came to celebrate the return of our brother from being stationed in South Korea in the military. We toasted with the Sake given to the Prime Minister of Japan as recommended by our favorite waiter, Steve. The atmosphere is unmistakable and the memories made here unforgettable. For us, this restaurant is everything that Pittsburgh is; proud, unique and unarguably wonderful. Try the eel - try the Korokke - try anything Steve recommends. You'll feel like your apart of their family and will soon be making plans for who you'll bring with you on your next stop in.",

She loved it, so we figured we would give it a shot. Service was very friendly and accommodating. Our small party had a vegetarian and they were more than happy to accommodate her with a Udon dish with vegetables and tofu. If you are a vegetarian, make sure to ask what they recommend as there are options that are not listed on the menu! Wine selection was acceptable, good quality wines and a good price point. Not a ton of a selection, but you don't really need it. I believe there were 3-4 different Sakes available as well as a few types of beer. What more do you really need? For appetizers we ordered the Gyoza, the calamari, the chicken meatballs, the scallops, and the potato cakes with vegetables. The potato cakes were a seasonal special and were fantastic. The sauce that was served with them was a perfect accompaniment! I would highly recommend them! The gyoza was also fantastic and our friend really enjoyed her scallops. I did not try the calamari but I heard it was wonderful as well. And I adored the chicken meatballs. They knocked it out of the park with the appetizers for sure.  For our meals, we were unsure about the hiroshimayaki, but don't be! It was AMAZING. My husband ordered his with beef and I am telling you I about climbed the table to eat nearly half of his meal. Wonderful stuff and so different. I had previously tried okonomiyaki from the food truck Fukuda and found it to be cloyingly rich. I just did not enjoy it, not even a little bit. But Teppanyaki Kyoto's hiroshimayaki is what Fukuda's okonomiyaki dreams of becoming one day. Perfectly balanced, and delicious. Yes the two dishes are inherently different, as the okonomiyaki doesn't have the egg or the noodles, but the flavors are essentially the same and Teppanyaki Kyoto knows better than to over power the flavors with too much mayonnaise. One of our friends also tried the green tea cheesecake and said it was also wonderful. All in all, a fantastic evening out with wonderful service and food. I would love to return! They also had a very nice selection of lunch specials! This is not a heavily trafficked area of Highland Park, but my Pittsburgh Zoo friends should definitely give this place a try!",

This is the dish that you cannot find elsewhere in Pittsburgh and, in my opinion, it alone is worth coming to the restaurant for. Since it takes 25 minutes to prepare -- order it early. Come with a group of people (maybe 4-5 in total) to get tatami seating for the best experience. As with all Asian fare, best way to enjoy your food is to order various dishes and share.   Since the portions are quite small, you'll need to order quite a few dishes or order a bowl of rice to really feel full (costs extra). I went with a friend and we got: hiyayako (silken tofu), grilled yellowtail, grilled hokke (mackerel), beef hiroshimayaki, and three servings orders of green tea ice cream for dessert. This was just enough to fill the two of us up and the total came out to about $54 in total. I found the grilled hokke to be too dry, salty, and lacking in flavor. Would not order it again.   This place gets four stars for serving delicious food that is difficult to find elsewhere in Pittsburgh, although I do wish that they offered a college special so that I could come here more often!",

Noodles - again out of little pre-packaged bags - very gummy. Come on... noodles! How to you mess up noodles?  Calamari - I think... I really think... pig (you know).

    "text": "This is my first yelp review in Pittsburgh since I've been living in this town for over a year, and there's a reason this place inspired me to. As a San Francisco Bay Area native where there's never a shortage of foodie places, I've been quite critical on Pittsburgh. However! There are a definitely a bunch of stand outs (and my list is growing!) and this is one of them.   The okonomiyaki was AMAZING. Other okonomiyakis that have graced my tummy in SF Japantown pale in comparison to this one- True story. I sat at the counter and couldn't help but respect the craft that they commanded to create this stuff.   The bacon wrapped mochi was just as yummy...they slow seared the mochi on all sides, and then did it all over again after they wrapped it in bacon.  I love bacon though so I might be biased on this one.  I went on a Wednesday night with my roomie and everyone was so friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back and plan on telling all my friends about it and dragging all my out of town visitors here. Thanks for the yummy food!",

    "text": "After wanting to go there for a long time, I finally went there a couple of months back. This isn't your typical Japanese sushi place, so be warned.  the Okonomyaki was really good, nothing like what I had tasted before and was great. The appetizers were pretty darn good as well. The service was a bit meh.  We had no idea what things were supposed to look like so we ended up getting a small plate that someone else had ordered so we just ate it. We explained our qualm to the waiter and were still charged for it at the end.  Other than that, I do want to go back again and try other things on the menu.  It is a tad bit expensive too, so do go knowing that.",

    "text": "This place is SO good, best Japaneese in Pittsburgh.  Go in and get a smattering of appitizers, the octopus balls are fantastic and the gyoza is mandatory.  Then to the pancake, as everyone is mentioning, they dance, they're delicious, etc.  I strongly recommend the one with the noodles.  And sit at the counter if you can, it's worth watching how they make the stuff up.",
