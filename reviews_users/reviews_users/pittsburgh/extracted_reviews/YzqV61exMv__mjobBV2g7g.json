The service was prompt and friendly - they were attentive without being annoying.    I got what I usually get at Thai places - Spicy Basil Noodles and they were probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  I got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8, but I can honestly say it was satisfactory level 8 spice worthy - which I truly appreciated.    It was jumping for dinner and it's BYOB so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand!",

They have a 1-10 scale for spiciness. I had a 4 with my dish and turned out perfect for me (not so spicy that I had to guzzle water, but enough to add to the flavor).",

Ended up biking over for takeout once every week or 2.  Living in CA now and haven't been back in about 4 years, and have a fantastic Thai restaurant on my corner, but I still miss Thai Cuisine. The food was great and the staff treated me very well as a regular. Decor and ambiance...lacked a bit but were in line with the prices and the neighborhood.",

The soba noodles were cooked great and the sauce was tasty. I ordered spicy level 5 but should have gone with something just a bit spicier. My fiance got a spicy basil rice dish but some of the vegetables in his rice were cold. Otherwise we really enjoyed the meal and I believe the lunch price was something like $6.95 or $7.95. The service was great and we had our waters refilled several times throughout the meal. Would definitely go back again.",

First attempt: Thai Cuisine.  It ain't so terrible.  The chicken pad thai was respectable.  The penang curry didn't quite have the rich peanut and coconut flavor I was craving, but the base curry flavors lingered in the background, which gives me hope.    Heck for $23 I'm willing to go there again.  Sad that they don't have curry puffs, but it's a great location, the people are friendly, and you can get delivery.     I'm still on my quest, but this certainly is a solid option when the craving for Thai hits.",

I give it 3 stars because I find it to be good/serviceable Thai food, but certainly not the best in the city.  I had the eggplant dish, which was hot, fresh and tasty, but what disappointed me was the lack of requested spice (level 9).  When I ask for something to be spicy, make it spicy.  Simple request, no?  Nevertheless, I still recommend this restaurant because the quality is good, the service is good and price is right.  A great spot in the Bloomfield neighborhood for sure.",

I also got the mosman curry, level 7, which was above average, but not amazing. It was not nearly as spicy as I thought a 7 would be.

    "text": "If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!  Now, I will be a tad sentimental here.  Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai.  A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since.  And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food!  Over the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC.  To be honest, it is not much to look at.  It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot.  But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little \"diner\".  Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :)  We have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had.  Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh.  BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :)  I think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for.  DH will scrape the bowl on this one.   I am a noodle junkie.  My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing.  I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can't find comparable anywhere else.  I will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.  If you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price, this is your spot.  And just remember - there is always takeout!",

My favorite go-to dish is the Roast Duck Curry entree, with a spice level of four. After reading other reviews I'll have to expand my horizons and try a few other things. On that first visit (since we hadn't planned on eating there) the name of the restaurant never registered with me, so I just started referring to it as 'Bangkok Orgasm'.  Nuf said!  Update 9/6/13: I still love this restaurant and stand by my five stars, but I will not order via Wheel Deliver anymore. I am convinced that although I specify the spice level in my online order that it does not get conveyed to Thai Cuisine by Wheel Deliver. I have had some disappointingly bland orders of roast duck curry, and this has never happened when I have eaten at the restaurant or stopped by for take-out and placed my order in person.",

With that being said I was hoping that all my stumbling around in the elements would not be in vain.     The food at Thai Cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops and calamari in a Thai chili sauce. The sauce is my favorite part of a Thai meal but Thai Cuisine came up short here. What I enjoy must about a Thai chili sauce is the complexity of flavors but this sauce in my dish was your standard thin runny brown sauce.  The kind that comes with lets say beef and broccoli.  I think the menu description was misleading and had I known it would be brown sauce I would have ordered something else.    Some of the onions in my dish were cold which leads me to believe that the food was not cooked to order or at least not all of it.  There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the calamari tasted great, but the dish lacked flavor. The carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition.  For my hubby I ordered the Thai steak , it tasted like a frozen salisbury steak dinner and salisbury steak just so happens to be one my least favorite foods.  Had I not sampled his dinner this would have been a solid three star review.   I see no reason to go back here.",

Even though I know I like the eggplant, and pick out half his vegetables- mmmmm, veggies- I can't order anything but the pad Thai I can't help it. I love it. The only change up in our routine the second time around was we ordered the pork buns. And I cannot tell you what a great move that was! They were seriously better than Noodleheads' buns, and I know that sounds sacrilegious, but they were!    Service has always been great as well. Now, we are here at lunch, and it has always been slow. I think that's just how it is in Bloomfield at that hour. Either way, everyone is polite and attentive, and the food comes in a very timely fashion.  All around, I really like this place for our mid-week-bite-for-lunch spot.

Now its clean and modern. Large decorative shades flow from the ceiling and tasteful artwork hangs on the walls. Even the flatware has been updated. It immediately felt cozier.  Now the big test: did the food get updated?  I rarely stray from the Chicken Pad Thai here so naturally it was an easy choice. It came out steaming. So hot in fact I couldn't even take an immediate bite and I have a metal mouth.  I'm happy to report after it cooled down that the dish had been prepared to match the new look and feel of Thai Cuisine. The sauce was tangy. The bean sprouts were crispy. And the chicken was sliced and cooked to perfection. The dish was drastically better than the last time I had Pad Thai here.  Now Thai Cuisine may not be my all-time favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh but this experience has most certainly put it back in the running.  Welcome back Thai Cuisine.",

I had wanted to try Thai Cuisine for a while but was held up by their remodel. Since I wasn't in before, I can't compare to the old, but I'm digging the new look! It's fresh and vibrant, with a friendly staff and comfy booths. They're winning with me already...  We were seated quickly, and almost as our butts hit the booth, there was a bowl of fried noodles and sweet n' sour sauce dropped off like lightning! Bonus points! Being totally committed to trying Pad Thai at every Thai place in the Burgh, you know what I ordered. Okay, you really want to know? Pad Thai with shrimp.  So here's the thing. I really liked the Pad Thai noodles and sauce. It was a huge portion that I ate entirely (lay off me, I'm starving!!) and it was very saucy (just the way I like it!). I was not into the shrimp. It tasted fishy. Like suspicious fishy. I couldn't put my finger on it. Was it unfrozen recently? Did it have freezer burn? Was it sitting out too long? I couldn't tell. But the one thing I knew was that it was not fresh. Bummer. It also came with this weird side salad on the plate. It was had a really thick, almost disgustingly so, peanut dressing with a touch of iceberg lettuce. I took a couple bites and gave up. Methinks not!  So mental note, next time don't order the shrimp. But seriously, this was the closest I've had to my favorite Pad Thai in the city, Spice Island in Oakland. I promise you, I'll order something different next time I go back!!",

    "text": "Leaning more towards 3.5, but that isn't currently an option...  I went here with a group on a Saturday night during Little Italy Days. I've tried getting in here before on a Saturday night and was turned away because they were so full so close to closing time, so I was thankful to find empty tables and room enough for our party of 6.    As one reviewer said before, the service was very attentive. I'd rather have a server who checks up on me too much than one who disappears for 40 minutes though, so it was no bother. I cannot complain at all about the service during the meal...she was prompt and very attentive and a water glass was never empty the entire time.  Straying away from my usual green curry, I got the spicy noodle dish at a level 5 out of 10. I can honestly say the noodle dish didn't have that much of a kick at all and despite being delicious on it's own, I added a good amount of sriracha to it.   Another dining companion said his curry wasn't hot enough either and he ordered an 8 out of 10, but he's also an absolute sadist when it comes to spice. The food was mediocre. Not the best thai I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.   I tried a piece of my friend's honey duck and it was absolutely delicious. Another diner was pretty \"meh\" about her dish as well and didn't finish it, but I liked what I had despite it not being hot enough. I would certainly come back during lunch and give this place another try.  Main problem came at the end with the check. We were a group of 6 and were told they couldn't split the check (which I expected) but they could take up to three forms of payment. No problem, we dividied up the bill according to who got what and told her which card goes with which dish.   We were then told that we have to give her the exact amount we wanted charged on each card and it had to all equal up to the total on the bill. That may sound simple, but with tax and gratuity it was RIDICULOUS sitting there like I was in math class working out who was going to charge what on their card. Left a sour taste in my mouth, as any modern day POS system could have done in seconds what I spent the better part of 10 minutes trying to figure out. Didn't help that she gave us 'tude about it, either.   Anywho, I may come back and try it, but certainly never in a large group format again.",

I have ordered the curry, pad thai, and spicy noodles and they've all been good. I usually try to choose the mock duck as the protein because you can't get it at very many places and it is delicious! As for their service, it has always been good. Yelp is so funny. One person on here rated them very low and the \"worst thai\" in Pittsburgh but in their review saying they ordered \"general tsao's chicken\"... not sure if that is a joke but I don't think a person is qualified to be rating restaurants when they rate a thai restaurant on their Chinese food. SIGH. There should be some sort of test to rate places on Yelp. I've eaten thai a lot in many cities and Thai Cuisine is one of the better ones in Pittsburgh...",

Even as a Thai-lover, I just couldn't imagine anything other than chimichangas, and I don't even LIKE chimichangas.  Well, Thai Cuisine turned my Mexican frown completely upside down.  I started with the fresh Thai rolls; a deliciously fresh spring roll that almost gave Trams' spring rolls a run for their money...almost.  For my main course I chose the day's special - Winter Curry with Shrimp.  A delightfully sweet mix of large shrimp, perfectly cooked potatoes and vegetables PLUS an amazing thai-type of squash similar to pumpkin swimming in luxurious creamy curry, this meal demands a return trip. Terrific, simply terrific (BYOB, btw).  Our server was incredible to boot, so yay for Thai Cuisine.

When it comes to Thai food, I'm a bit of a broken record. I love Pad Sew and Pad Thai dishes, and typically insist the table gets at least one. Our table ordered the Pad See Ew, a calamari special, and I ordered a bowl of the Tom Yum Soup.   The Pad See Ew was delicious, and felt like the perfect comfort food on a colder evening. We ordered it with veggies, and they were perfectly cooked--not too soggy, but also not too crunchy. I was pleasantly surprised by the Thai calamari we had, it wasn't something I'd typically order at a Thai place, but the sauce was awesome, and the little fried calamari's rivaled that of the best Italian places. The Tom Yum soup is soon to be my new go to dish. Once again, it has that feeling of comfort food. Judging on the proximity of this place to my house, I can tell I will be ordering this for take out often.   We did something very out of character for the group and ordered dessert after eating. I'm not a sweets girl, but EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THE DESSERT HERE. I can't recommend the dessert rice dishes more, they were spectacular. We had one with rice and mango--it's almost like a sweet risotto. Their desserts rotate on a seasonal basis, but they typically will have a rice one on the menu. It's a unique flavor that can't be missed.  I'm sure I will be back again soon with a bottle of wine (BYOB), and an empty stomach.",

    "text": "Elsewhere, I have bemoaned the standardization of Thai food (at least outside of NYC. NYC seems to be in the midst of a love affair with regional Thai cuisine which is exciting). When I heard that this restaurant was called simply Thai Cuisine, I was expecting more bland pad thai, more limp pad see ew.   What we got, though, well exceeded my expectations. The Viking shrimp was particularly good - a hot pot with glass noodles, prawns, carrots, onions, tons of cilantro, and quite a punch of spice (the waiter asked us how spicy we wanted the food on a scale of 1 to 10. We said 4, and I'm glad we didn't say 5 or 6 because 4 was lip burning).  The ginger root chicken, normally a hot bed of blandness was also surprisingly tasty - tons of fresh bell peppers and celery, and chicken in a delicious salty and sweet black bean sauce.    Extra points here for a gracious and friendly waitstaff, and for Pittsburgh prices - dinner for two was $27 and we have enough left over for at least one extra meal.",

    "text": "OMG! I don't know why i waited so long to do eat here? Was it the very unassuming space it occupies or the generic name? No, i think it was because I didn't want to be disappointed. After living in LA I had resisted trying Thai food in other cities because I didn't think it could compare but boy was I wrong! I ate here early evening on a Tuesday when I was the only diner. The hostess was quite charming and welcoming and asked me to sit wherever I wanted rather than ushering me to the table that would be most convenient to the server. But the server seemed quite happy to come to me and to recite the specials to me. I ordered two of them for my meal and they both were incredibly delicious and each had just the right texture. I started with the soft shell crab with two dipping sauces. The crab practically melted in my mouth and the shell gave it just a little crunch. Both dipping sauces were tasty but I preferred the hotter one. Then the roast duck in a curry sauce came and it was cut into small cutlets ( or i guess what today we call ' tenders') and they were tender with just enough crispiness on the outside of each piece. The sauce was a light curry one and not gloppy as they sometimes fan be. I had asked for a 6th degree of hot-ness on a scale of 1-10 but could have ordered a 7. I can't wait to go back with friends so I can try many more of their dishes. You should gather a couple of friends and go too!",

    "text": "Thai Cuisine is the slightly pricier of the two Thai places near my house, so for super casual takeout purposes I usually just go to Thai Gourmet. Their Pad Thai is delicious and enough for four meals. I also adore the girls who work the front of the house there. Thai Cuisine's food tends to be a bit more flavorful however, and sometimes that's just what I want without having to drive somewhere.   My boyfriend and I ordered from here the other night, and I must say I think we'll be back for a sit-down meal fairly soon! I tried their version of Pad Thai since I hadn't had that in a while, and he had spicy basil friend rice. The Pad Thai had a tamarind sauce, which I've been led to believe is more authentic. Authentic or not it had that red spicy edge that I prefer in Pad Thai, and I couldn't get enough of it! Most Pad Thai around here is a sweet brown sauce, which is fine but not as complex. The Thai place near my mother's house makes their Pad Thai the way I like it, and I've been on an unofficial hunt to track down a similar version of the dish nearer to where I live. The hunt is now over! The portions here are a bit smaller for the higher price point, but the taste and quality balances it out very well. The service has also been great whenever I've come in, something else that I really appreciate. I'll for sure be back for more takeout and with visiting friends for a proper dinner very soon.",

I've tried a few things here and I like them - their pad thai is good, as are their basil noodles. I really love their tom yum soup. The thing that makes me sad is the curry.   I have tried the panang, green and red curries here and ...they kind of taste the same, which is disappointing. I blame this on the coconut milk, because the three times I have ordered  curries from there, they were all extremely watery/milky and the coconut milk overpowered the rest of the flavor. Unfortunately, the milk seemed to dilute the spice as well (that or my level 5 green curry was spiced identically to my boyfriend's level 9 panang curry). They were still tasty, for sure, but coconut milk soup isn't what I normally expect for my curry.   I'd suggest their noodle dishes without reservation, but for curry, I'd point someone down a few blocks to Thai Gourmet.",

Great seating, with capacity for about 45 or so people. Great dinning area with access to windows allowing the sun in. Flexible hours, often open until 10\\11 at night.  I've been here a few times now and each time has been consistently delicious. A friend and I enjoyed steamed dumpling, which were delicious but alittle pricey for 4 ($4.95). I enjoyed the Red Curry (Roasted Duck, Tomatoes, Bell Peppers, Basil Leaves and Pineapple in a Coconut Curry) which was amazing. All fresh ingredients cooked to order. I had mine at a 8/10 spice level, which had a slight kick but nothing too crazy, really it depends on who is cooking that day. My friend enjoyed the Yellow Curry (Chicken, Potatoes and Carrots in a Coconut Curry) which was just as great!  This place is great and is worth checking out. About $10 a plate and offers enough food to fill you for lunch and dinner!",

My gf had the vegetarian pad thai.  She thought it was good, but a little too soupy (too much fluid).  Also, they offer most things spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  They said 5 is good, but I tasted almost no spice.  I'd go for a 10 next time.  From what I read this places is among the best in Pitt, and I can see how this might be True.

    "text": "First time at Thai Cuisine since the revamp.  When I lived in Friendship a decade ago I frequented Thai Cuisine and never had a bad meal there.  When the wife was craving some Thai food I suggested we try my old stomping grounds especially since I noticed it's been remodeled.   I realized that the place is half the size of the old set up which makes for a better atmosphere.  Everything is still new and clean.  Dark colors and somewhat dim lighting make for an intimate meal even when the bright sun is shining in through the window overlooking Liberty Avenue.  The service was great, almost too attentive.  We had our waters filled every time we took a sip.  Our meals came quickly, almost too quick, making us think too much prep work is done.  The food was really good though.  We each got a bowl of soup.  The wife got the Tom Yum with Shrimp.  It was hot and sour in a good way.  There were three nice sized shrimp in the broth and tasted fresh.  I got the Tom Kha with shrimp, which was excellent.  The coconut broth was smooth and delicious.  I always enjoy this dish and make sure I try it everywhere.  Thai Cuisine balanced this soup very well.  We then shared a massive plate of Pad Thai with veggies and tofu.  The pad thai was good, but not great.  The portion was huge, definitely shareable especially after eating a bowl of soup.  I wasn't impressed however with the amount of veggies in the dish or the amount of sauce.  It lacked both and might get to great with a bit more of each.  Also, the veggies seemed wilted and not really fresh.    So, in short. Thai Cuisine is a good, but not great Thai option in Pittsburgh.",

Their Pad See Ew, Three Flavor Chicken, and Thai Spring Rolls are our regular favorites. We also love having their Mango Sticky Rice for desert when it is in season.",

    "text": "This is my local Thai food place. It's not necessarily my favorite, or the best around but here's why I like it:  -It's good. I've liked everything I've ordered. -It's dependable. Things are consistently good, and I order here fairly often. -They usually get the spice right (of what you ask for on a scale of 1-10) - It's better than the other one that is a block away. I don't know what other people have to say about this because I hear conflicting opinions of Thai Cuisine and Thai Gourmet, but I have tried them both and can say that I just like this one more.   My favorite dish is the green curry. Most veg packed and the tofu option is a great combination (I'm not a veg, but I eat veg often). I really like the way their tofu is steamed, its creamy and delicious in the thin curry sauce. I usually prefer a thicker curry but something about this curry really works as a thin texture - pretty soupy. But it's light and delicious and I am usually drinking it out of the bottom of my bowl like soup.   I get take-out here quite often, and it is always ready fairly quickly, but I really wish they would deliver so I would not have to move my lazy, hungover ass out of my house.   The dining experience is OK. BYOB is a great plus, but the interior leaves a lot to be desired. The service is always great. Friendly and accommodating and the manager is always there to greet with a smile.",

As I knew nothing about Thai, she ordered a Thai Iced Tea for me, and it was creamy and delicious. Kinda like a Yoo-Hoo and iced tea, minus the chocolate. I ordered a second one, even though it was extra. I didn't care.   We ordered the special appetizer, Soft Shell Crab. So worth the splurge. It was perfectly cleaned, unlike what I've had from Wholey's before. There were two sauces accompanying the crab, and both suited it's crispness perfectly.   Jess made a few suggestions on what to get for the entree, (our waitress was in training, but still was awesome) and I decided on the Param, because I love peanut sauce! You could customize how hot you wanted your dish, but I was being a sissy that night, and decided to go with a 3. It was perfect. Jess got Yellow Curry Shrimp. I ate half of hers, too.  Oops. I've also never had curry before. Oh my. So good.   We sat and chatted for a while, and were kept care of well with refills on our water. They are a BYOB,  so next time, I'll bring some beer!      Happy Eating!",

Thai Cuisine has them down to a T. They were perfect and the sauce was awesome.  I wanted to try something different, so per our wonderful server's suggestion- my friend and I split the eggplant entree with beef and the spicy basil noodles with chicken. We ordered both at a whopping 11 (1-10 heat scale). After talking with our server about Thai heat levels, he informed us that if we enjoy spicy food we should order above the \"American 10\". He told us that \"Thai hot\" is a 15. We took a chance with ordering it at 11 (I normally stick with the 5-6 range) and it was a good decision! The food was AWESOME and wasn't too spicy at all. The eggplant dish was amazing- the chili garlic sauce was OUT of this world and of course, they are always generous with the sauce- which I adore. The spicy basil noodles were amazing.. I have been dreaming about those noodles ever since.  When it comes to Thai food, Thai Cuisine is where it's at. The food is AWESOME, the service is always consistent and wonderful and they are also BYOB. You can't beat it.",

If you want spicier food I suggest starting closer to 5.   All of our dishes were delicious and we agreed it was better than we've had at other Thai restaurants in pittsburgh.

As far as appetizers, I've had the steamed Pork Buns (a \"special\" that is pretty much always on the menu, as far as I know), which are phenomenal. Everyone raves about Noodlehead's Pork Buns, but I think these may be better. The chicken satay and spring rolls are great as well.  My S.O. typically gets the house noodles or one of the curries (favorites including panang, green, and yellow). My favorite dish on the menu is the hawaiian fried rice. There is such a variety of flavors and textures in the meal that combine to make a great entree overall.  Finally, the servers are all fantastic and the owner (I think she is the owner - she is almost always at the front of the house) is so sweet and sincere. Seeing her is always a pleasure!",

We walked up to Thai Gourmet, our usual go-to Thai spot, and were greeted by a \"closed\" sign on the door. They don't open until 5 on Sundays?!  But I want Thai food NOWWWWW (feeling very Veruca Salt that day). Dejected, I walked my rumbly tummy up Liberty Ave, and lo and behold, another Thai restaurant appears a few blocks up. Whine and ye shall receive.  After perusing the menu, we decide to take out some chicken pad thai and another dish called \"three flavored chicken.\" Both solid choices. The pad thai portion was huge and chock full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat or veggies in here!)  The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \"three flavored chicken\" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I've ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn't really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I'll probably order a 33. :)  Overall, this is very yummy Thai food. I'm not sure that it will replace my usual go-to Thai spot, but it'll definitely be high on my list!",

I ordered the Thai Cuisine Bird's Nest and it came in a bowl of slop. I took about two bites that looked good but I only got two crunches out of the entire dish (it was an average portion). My dad got the glass noodle salad and he said it only had two pieces of shrimp in the whole thing. My grandfather got the steamed fish, he said it tasted like it was boiled in dirty bucket water he also said it had no taste and it was over cooked, it was bland, and that the ingredients were cheap, not to mention the fact that there were uncooked carrots and chives floating in a thick mysterious liquid. My grandmother got pineapple fried rice and for the time being it was moderately good, but later she said her stomach hurt and it continued to hurt throughout the night. This will conclude my review. Keep in mind a similar experience has happened 5 times in the past year.",

My husband loves it and he convinced me to try it today. He picked this place based off of reviews and I am so happy he convinced me to step out of my comfort zone. The food was AMAZING! I seriously want to order from here once a week. We had Crab Rangoon, spring rolls, and spicy noodles with chicken. I loved everything! We decided on a spice level of 5 which was great. I would probably drop it to a 4 next time based on personal preference. The delivery driver was friendly and he arrived within 30 minutes which was 15 minutes prior to the quoted time. I have discovered the greatness of Thai food and I will be supporting this business A LOT in the future!",

I have not tried a huge variety, but the noodle dishes and curries so far have been good.  Fine quality meat, good protein/veggie ratio and flavorful sauces with the correct thickness.  The fresh spring roll is different than what I am used to and probably would not order again.",

I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)",

The food was great but, in all honesty the food has been on the decline...you want specifics? here they are: We ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup (we ordered the Hot Pot, which technically they no longer have but gave us 3 orders of the soup). guess how many pieces of tofu were in each bowl of soup....4? 3? 2? Nope. 1. So, I called and they refunded one of the cups of soup ($3.50)- honestly, i don't think this was the best remedy but, whatever. My eggplant with tofu had exactly 6 small pieces of tofu. Now, let's be real, tofu is CHEAP. the asian food store in the strip sells blocks of it for less than 30 cents...and those blocks make up 6 pieces o' tofu thai cuisine style...so, please explain this one....anyway, i'm just not happy with the price of the dishes and what's inside...it's really the beginning of the end when restaurants get this high on themselves.",

Context is, of course, that I expected very little from this town, yet I've been completely surprised. #1 - faux meat on a menu is a huge plus for me, I just love it, and I don't care to hear comments like \"if you are a vegetarian, why would you eat something that is meant to taste and look like meat?\" Shut up. I just like it. #2 - the prices are so cheap. I only looked at the vegetarian menu where every entree is about $10 for dinner, and while that's no steal nor does it compare to Thai food prices in Thailand, it's decent. #3 - cutest. waitress. ever. AND she mentioned that \"all of my cool friends have read that book\" which, by default, makes me a cool kid? Hmmm. Maybe. Then again, maybe not.",

The tables and seating look much nicer than the price, which was under $10 for me I believe for just a curry/meat/rice bowl, which was more than filling. My dad ordered the same thing and asked for \"9\" spiciness, but did not think it was spicy at all. I asked for \"5\" not really sure what the scale meant and it did not taste remotely spicy (which was fine).  We've gone a second time and both got the same thing as the first.

The competition is serious; both places have excellent food and both are a long way from pretentious dining.  After a few experiences at each, Thai Cuisine emerged as the winner.  This is mainly because 1) I had the lights turned out on me (twice) without warning at Thai Gourmet - as in \"hey we're closing but instead of telling you, we're just going to turn out the lights, hint hint\" and 2) I was served by a 10 year old on more than one occasion.  There's just something not right about a kid uncorking your wine tableside for you...   So Thai Cuisine is the place.  Like others have said, the food is excellent, but what's great in addition to that is that the service is outstanding.  The staff are knowledgeable about the menu and make great recommendations.  They are patient and friendly in handling my annoying vegan questions and have a variety of mock meats to choose from, if that's your thing.  Keep an eye out for the mango sticky rice dessert - they only serve it in season!",

I ordered the hot and sour soup which I gobbled up right away. It was delicious and super hot, just how I like it. I ordered one of the Pad Thai's I don't quite recall which one exactly but I thought it was very yummy. I enjoyed the fact that they give you a scale of spiciness from 1-10 to choose from. Usually at restaurants people just ask if you want it mild or spicy, but this gives people a nice range to choose from. My friend got one of the curry dishes they had and it was really good as well.

I love that the decor has really transformed since the remodel years ago but the food has stayed the same. I honestly love it. It is hard to just pick one thing on the menu that I love because, honestly it is all so freaking good. This trip we came because I had a friend visiting from California and was craving Thai food. Of course this was the spot that we recommended. IT is so close to my house that I come more often than I should.   Starters:  Thai Spring Rolls (fried): Fried spring rolls stuffed with vegetables, glass noodles. Served with plum sauce. I mean their fried springs rolls are fantastic. I think that they were 2 in the order so if you are looking to feed a group it would be a good idea to pick more from the menu. Filling but I could eat the order of two myself, and I am not that big of a sharer.   Thai Cuisine Rolls (fresh): Fresh rice paper stuffed with lettuce, basil leaves, and vermicelli noodles. Served with Thai Cuisine special house sauce. These were also good. We added tofu to the rolls. They also come with only two rolls but are a bit bulkier so they are more sustainable for an appetizer.  We asked for these rolls to be cut in half to help us divide them up more evenly with the group. This worked out nicely for all of us.   Fried tofu (personal favorite/fried): Crispy fried tofu. Served with a peanut sauce. Personal favorite. I love fried tofu and Thai Cuisine does a really good job. Not to crispy and not too much breading. Just the right amount of fried to make you want to come back for more but not worry about the calories.   Main Dish:  Panang Curry: Broccoli, bell peppers, and basil leaves in a coconut curry sauce. Heck yes. This is what I get all the time. I add extra veggies and chicken to mine to make it a more filling dish. I love the sauce and could drink it if that wasn't super weird or possibly give me a bad belly ache. The veggies are always crisp and tasty. I like that you also get a choice for brown or white rice. I usually like brown but sometimes will mix it up if I am feeling peckish. I would suggest a nice even spice level of 3. I do not like to not be able to enjoy what I am eating so a level 3 is just up my alley.  I love it here. I think that more people should try it out. They are also BYOB so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for a glass fee that was really reasonable. They even brought us out a nice bucket of ice to chill the wine in.   The service and the staff were excellent. The food is top notch. Come here for a nice dinner and great conversation. It really is something else.",

Honestly the food is just mediocre - it's not great, it's not awful, but you're safest going with a noodle dish or curry rather than something more complicated. Doesn't get terribly spicy and I've definitely found better Thai places in Pittsburgh - but I'll order a pad Thai for delivery from here because the price isn't bad and it's still fine.",

    "text": "For a time in Pittsburgh, I lived within walking distance of Thai Cuisine and frequented this spot on the regular. It was never usually crowded upon my visits, but after walking by multiple times after moving from Bloomfield, it looked like they had a steady stream of customers each time when I passed. One of my favorite things about many restaurants in Pittsburgh is the BYOB-so economical and allows you to bring a wine that you already know you will enjoy in addition to having paid about 1/3 or more less than what one would pay at a restaurant.   The decor is modest but service has always been warm and efficient. I definitely enjoyed the booths which I find less and less at ethnic restaurants. What you are really here, though, is for the food. I've tried a variety of options here over time: the thai spring rolls (crunchy, sufficient veggie filling), the mixed vegetables with chicken, the spicy basil with chicken (spicy but not overwhelming for my palate), the pad thai with chicken (saucy, noddles cooked perfectly, generous portion of chicken), and the spicy basil noodles with chicken (at a 7 this was perfect for me and provided some heat without overdoing it-very flavorful).   I'd definitely recommend dining at Thai Cuisine for a delicious Thai meal! Parking on the street can be difficult; I recommend the pay parking lot around the corner from the restaurant!",

The atmosphere and warm and the owners are always very pleasant. It's also BYOB which is an automatic win!  Their menu is huge. I typically always get something chicken related.

So much so that I have to limit myself to a weekly trip, cause if I had unlimited money, I'd eat here every day.  Their vegan/veg options are plentiful, and the staff are super-knowledgeable about all the ingredients in their food and how items are prepared. You can rest-assured if you have any sort of dietary restriction or allergy, Thai Cuisine will happily accommodate you. They are also BYOB will a nominal fee. I recommend popping across the street to Caliente to pick-up beer if you forget to plan ahead!  My go-to dish is the Three Flavored Tofu with brown rice. Tofu is not an easy thing to cook, and there is nothing worse than mushy tofu. I can promise that the tofu from Thai Cuisine is fried to a crispy, golden perfection. Even your most carnivorous friends would find this dish delightful.  Never change, Thai Cuisine.",

Around the city of Pittsburgh there's a lot of Thai restaurants so you really have to make yourself stand out over the other restaurants and Thai Cuisine just doesn't have that quality. I started with spring rolls and veggie Tom Kha soup. The soup was very good. The spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok, nothing special.  For my entree I ordered the veggie bird nest noodles (crispy noodles). I didn't think it was that good. There was WAY too much sauce, it was almost a soup and the sauce didn't have much flavor at all. Also the veggies were sliced too big, they should have been cut into smaller pieces, it would have made the dish more manageable to eat. I'll eat at Thai Cuisine again if it's suggested by someone else but it won't be my first choice for a thai restaurant.",

I called to be absolutely sure they can veganize menu items and to my excitement, they could! They were incredibly nice and understood my concerns, a lot of Thai restaurants have fish sauce hidden in every dish, but this place does not!   It's easy to order there and online (via grub hub), all you have to do is make a note that the dish needs to be vegan and it even prints off on the receipt, so when they drop off your order you get some additional piece of mind.  The cashew entree with tofu/veggies and the green salad are a must. The tofu is fried but not crispy amid all the veggies & comes with rice to soak up the mild chili sauce. The salad is fairly simple with greens, cucumber, onion etc. but the dressing or sauce as I would say, is stellar. It's a peanut/coconut milk sauce and I can honestly say I would gladly eat this every day for the rest of my life.",

I called Thai Cuisine around 11:30 am to figure out if/how they could do our order.  I wanted to see if they could even have our food at 5.  The gentleman I spoke with was awesome.  Let me know that while they didn't deliver, grub hub did.  He also let me know  - they could take our order over the phone so they could start - or I could submit it on grubhub with the 5p delivery request.  I asked which was easier for them as I truly did appreciate all their help.  THe order was placed via grubhub. ( I will tell you the grubhub part of the experience was terrible (delivery driver in the lobby of the hospital saying rude things about other races, phone didn't work and said our delivery was delivered 10 minutes before we received it).  But this isn't a review on grubhub!)  Thai Cuisine beautifully labeled very container so I knew who got what food.  They sent forks, plates, extra sauce and chopsticks.  Everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for an easier order.    Every.single.physician raved about their food.  Every drop was eaten.  It was delicious!  Not a single complaint.  I don't have any eating in the restaurant experience, but to go orders are amazing and will certainly happen again!  Thank you Thai Cuisine for being so helpful and accomodating!",

For appetizers, I've tried their taro roll (good!) and their thai spring rolls (good as well!).  For soups, I've tried their Tom Yum soup and it was excellent - just not served in a easy-to-ladle-and-serve container.  BUT, with that being said, head straight there and order their curry!  It's excellent!",

Aside from that, my husband and I enjoyed a great meal.  We ordered the Fresh Tofu Roll, Spicy Beef Basils and Chicken Pad Thai.  It seems that no one talks about this number system of how spicey they should make your food.  The waiter asks if how spicey it should be from 1 to 10 (being the hottest).  We picked a number 4 and the Spicy Beef Basils was still very spicy.  The Pad Thai was delicious and amazing.  All together our bill came out to be $32.  We will definitely go here again very soon!",

I was feeling ridiculously lazy tonight so I ordered delivery from them for the millionth time (available through Wheel Deliver, FYI) and I felt like they deserved some recognition since I have never had a negative experience here.  There isn't much to say about Thai Cuisine, really. The name says it all--straight-up, no frills Thai. They aren't trying to do anything creative or fusiony, they just make good food. First things first, I'm obsessed with fresh spring rolls so for a restaurant to become my primary Thai destination, it has to get those right. Thai Cuisine's are not the best I've ever had, but they are definitely up there as one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. Soft, fresh, and big...nothing's worse than a puny spring roll that is practically frozen from sitting in a refrigerator all day (ahem...Thai Place). So since Thai Cuisine passes the spring roll test, I can talk about their other food, which is all delicious. My favorite is the Pineapple Curry, but I've liked everything I've tried here. If you're one of those people who doesn't venture past Pad Thai, don't worry, that's good too. As a bonus, the portions here are pretty large so the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get.  The most reliable Thai place I've found so far in the city (although I haven't tried them all yet).",

    "text": "I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:  a) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town  b) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths  This place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed.   On the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.  The takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.  p.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality.",

I haven't tried the curries, but after reading the other reviews it is next on my list.  The decor is more 'professional' than Spice Island and its generally  quieter, so its easier to chat in a larger group.",

I always get my food with a spice level between 3-4.  3 has a nice kick to it, where you can still enjoy your food. I made the mistake once getting a 7 and couldn't really enjoy it because my nose was running.  If you're one that likes that kind of spice I suggest getting a 7.    The chicken Green Curry is also another go to item. Filled with plenty of vegetables, nice size pieces of chicken and the sauce is very good.    The owner is the friendliest person I've ever met. Always pleasant. Overall my FAVORITE Thai spot in Pittsburgh.",

The restaurant is also really clean and has nice furniture and lighting, making for a relaxing atmosphere.   The panang curry with tofu was really flavorful and the veggies were fresh and well cooked, not mushy. The tofu also had a tangy, fresh flavor and was not bland. I ordered spice level 7 - they deliver spice on a 1-10 scale. It had a good amount of heat, but I like curry HOT so I'd probably go to a 9 next time. You can also ask for a dish of spices, if you prefer to customize the spice level yourself.   This place is also BYOB so it would be perfect for a casual date or celebration.

Pittsburgh has more than a few asian noodle fusion and Thai noodle spots but NOTHING compares to the Chaing Mai at Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield.   Everything at Thai cuisine is awesome but these noodles just blew me away. Juicy chicken, perfectly crisp blanched veggies and noodles all topped in a fabulous coconut curry sauce. Finished with a few crispy fried thin noodle crispies that add a little crunch!",

I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent.",

The lunch prices here are very affordable and the service was friendly. The fried wonton pieces they gave us before our meal was sort of stale though. Anyway, I got the pad see ew and it was okay, borderline pretty good. It wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be compared to the other Thai restaurants I've been to, but again, it was still good, just not memorable. You also get a good amount of food too for the lunch specials. We ended our meal with the mango & sweet rice dessert and it was tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly and the mango was ripe and sweet. Overall the food was good (A-ok), but I sort of feel like I've had more flavorful Thai food at other restaurants. But I can see why people come here for a quick and affordable lunch especially if you are craving Thai food.",

This was it! and I was grateful!  I went with about 8 people and we BYOB'ed which was a fantastic idea. Some semi-sweet white wine went well with the flavorful light Thai food. Most of the table had the curries(I thought the red was the best), but I went with the eggplant with the vegetarian duck. Simply delicious! Highly highly recommend it. The spicy basil sauce was the highlight. My partner had one of the chef specials, which was by far the most interesting, but maybe not the tastiest.   Overall, an affordable, low-fuss, great place to eat. There also seemed to be a steady crowd there when we got there and left. It looks like a popular spot. For good reason!",

I started with Tom Yum Veggie, it was loaded wit LOTS of fresh vegetables, the broth had a little too much lime in it for me and the idea of adding extra heat with chili flakes was okay but overall the broth lacked any sort of flavor outside of base, lime, chili flakes.   I had the Spciy Basill Noodles, this dish was excellent very similar to Pad Kee Mao but it had egg and bell pepper in it. This dish alone deserved 5 stars.  My only other critique is that I had ginger tea and it was westernized version, on the sweet side and lacking the spiciness of True ginger tea.  With my little nit-picks aside I currently highly recommend this dining establishment, not that they need much help, they were very busy as they should be - go enjoy.",

I've not had a bad meal here, and everything I've tried has been delicious, with the green curry standing out in my mind as one of the best I've had anywhere. We came here with a large group of people one night, some of whom had never had Thai food, and all left happy and appreciative of my excellent taste when it comes to choosing restaurants. (pat, pat, pat). One of my friends had the springroll and liked it so much he ordered another for dinner. Service here is always good, with a friendly and professional staff that takes the time to help you with ordering. The one downside is that parking is a challenge, as this is a busy street in a bustling neighborhood. I usually find parking on a sidestreet, and would brave much more difficult hurdles to get to this food.",

Let me start with a little story.  My sister lived in Northern California and was visiting.  We were talking about places to eat and I of course mentioned and suggested Thai Cuisine, knowing how good their food is.  My sister was skeptical, to say the least, mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the San Francisco area, could a place in Pittsburgh actually be that good if not better than restaurants in CA?  I decided to let the food speak for itself  --- and it did!  My sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she LOVED it.  In fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best she had had - and that it was too bad that it was in Pittsburgh.    Me personally?  I love the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and I am not vegan or vegetarian.  I would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  The crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  The soups are all pretty great.    You should try this restaurant, it will definitely be worth your time.  And if you like your food spicy, like I do, make sure you tell them you want it thai spicey at 10 out of 10!  :)",

I've visited most of the other thai places in town (Nicky's Thai Kitchen, Bangcock Balcony, Thai Gourmet, Thai Me Up, Thai Place (fox chapel and shadyside) and they are all inferior to thai cuisine in bloomfield.  Thai cuisine's curries are always sublime.  As my husband said, their curries are like \"a party in my mouth\".  The flavors are sublimely mixed, like perfect artistry.   Since it open over 10 years ago, I have been a fan.  I know them on a first name basis as I've been going there for their curry for so long.  Their noodle dishes are good, but the curry is where they surpass everyone in town.    PS I still have to try \"the Smiling Banana Leaf\", but I'm always so disappointed by the amount of fish sauce in all of the other curries in town that I can't take trying out new thai places in town anymore.  None of them compare.   I am the poster child for this place and I tell everyone who comes to Pittsburgh, who will listen, that they must get there asap.",

The owner, Lisa, couldn't have been any nicer! So sweet!  I started off with the Fresh (not fried) Thai Cuisine roll. Not the best I've ever had, but very good (good enough that I WOULD re-order them).   I then moved on to the Spicy Basil Chicken. I ordered brown rice and for the month of February, it comes in the shape of a heart! Whimsy! This dish was very yummy! Freshly prepared, the veggies were cooked just right (tender crunchiness), the chicken was moist and the spice level (I chose 5) was just right. I would order this dish again as well.  In summary, reasonably priced, VERY friendly service (our waiter was charming), great food and a nice atmosphere. I would definitely seek this restaurant out on my next visit.",

I didn't discover it until I had lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, but since then, my friends and I have been going almost weekly--I think it's becoming an addiction.  They have a good number of tables and a couple of booths, so seating has never been an issue, even when we're with a larger group. The staff are friendly and incredibly attentive; I don't think I've ever had a glass of water that was less than three-quarters full. The food arrives at your table less than 10 minutes after the waiter takes your order. Their spice levels are pretty on point and range from 1-10, but you can always ask for the spice rack if you need an extra kick. I've tried almost all their noodle dishes and a handful of the curries and nothing has disappointed. They make one of the best Pad Thais I've ever eaten. They also have specials that are ever rotating, which makes it nice if you're looking to try something new. In general, everything is flavorful and you get what you order. Portions are sufficient for a solid meal and very reasonably priced.  I might venture and say that this is one of the best Thai places in Pittsburgh, but I know that's highly debated here. I'll just say that it's one of the most reliable Thai places I've ever gone to and I'm happy to frequent it regularly.",

I headed to Thai Cuisine with high hopes and several positive reviews from friends.  The service was good, decor so-so, and prices were great.  In fact, I double-checked the bill because I thought the waitress may have forgotten to add an entree, it was that reasonably priced!    The food was good, solid thai food.  My mind wasn't blown, nor was I disappointed.  I think all thai restaurants need to unite and decide on a single \"heat scale\" to rule them all.  Some places it's 1-5, some 1-10, and I've even seen a 1-7 thrown in here and there.  The problem is, they are all subjective to the cook.  I ordered a 7 out of 10 and got back something milder than mild buffalo wing hot.  I think I ruined the food a little by adding my own mix of chilis.  My wife loved her curry, and my pad thai wasn't bad.  I'd go back, but the search continues...",

This is in part due to proximity, but the relationship is on no small part sustained through friendly staff and consistent dining experiences.  Thai Cuisine is -- as my wife and I like to put it -- a rainy-Sunday-evening type place. Their curry broths are great, the apps are tasty, but not too filling, and the ambiance -- particularly after their recent renovations -- is warm and inviting.

    "text": "We stopped back in here on a hot Friday night for our second visit to the place, and it was just as amazing as the first, several years ago.  I like the fact that the name of this restaurant is just what they offer: Thai Cuisine.  Nothing fancy, nothing they can charge you an arm and a leg for because it's gourmet or anything like that.  It's just good, delicious, well-prepared Thai food, served by a knowledgable and friendly waitstaff.  Last night, we were starving after walking around in the 90+ degree heat for several hours, so we ordered a few plates of appetizers to split before our entrees.  They have a page of 'daily specials' with their menu, and 'shrimp blankets' were on it, so we checked them out.  Basically, it's a shrimp (tail-on) in a spring roll, served with a dipping sauce.  So very good.  We also got an order of the spring rolls, which were ever-so-slightly tangy, and the Thai toast, which was so crispy and delicious, I considered getting a second order.  Their cucumber dipping sauce comes with little chunks of fresh cucumber in it.    And since I recently discovered the magic of veggie tom-yum soup, I decided to try theirs.  Oh, so good!  On a hot day, I always crave something salty, and this was exactly what I wanted: the bowl is crammed with veggies and tofu (salty, spicy tofu - yum!), and the broth is just spicy enough to please your tastebuds but not overwhelm them.  The servers will ask how spicy you would like to have your meal prepared (the soup as well).  I tried everything at a 4, which I felt was just fine.  It wasn't bland, but I wasn't panting.  Our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy, so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave!  I had the garlic pepper pork (my favorite Thai meal) for an entree.  It was incredible, salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly-prepared way.  Lots of good chunks of veggies on the plate as well, and enough sauce to spread on your rice (and enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day!).  My husband got the pork fried rice, and it was a huge, tasty portion.  Thankfully, the servers were quick with water refills, because all that saltiness makes you thirsty!  Another perk - Thai Cuisine is BYOB!  I truly wish we'd planned on our visit last night, so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us (the closest liquor store is down on Butler Street, so a bit of a hike if you're walking), but we just happened to be in the area when my Thai food craving hit.  I am so glad Thai Cuisine was there to supply the delicious food that I needed!",

    "text": "Thai Cuisine changed us. My dining companion and I like to explore a menu, trying a bunch of different things. Yet, we both repeated our original orders (Pumpkin Green Curry for me and Spicy Noodles for him) on the second trip. We always share our meals so we get to try two instead of one. Yet, neither of us let the other have a single bite, or even asked for one.   With a fun waitstaff, no reservations needed, under $20 per person meals, BYO, and, consistently good food, we will return. Maybe next time we will explore and share... But I wouldn't count on it...",

    "text": "If you get nothing else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful.   I just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.  They were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend's and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own!   As we rolled out of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!",

The waiter introduced himself and gave his recommendations on the menu.  We ordered an appetizer, meal, and dessert.  He did not rush our meal, which was fabulous.  Dessert....we had the mango with sticky rice...delicious.  This was a new item that I tried and I was pleasantly surprised.  There isn't much that will keep me away from this wonderful place.",

The dough is soft and savory, and the slice of cucumber cuts through the other flavors for a refreshing break. I got the red curry for an entree, as well. The salad was crisp, and the peanut dressing had just the right amount of kick. The curry itself was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of coconut, and the basil mixed with the pineapple really worked well to balance out the spicyness.",

And also, you can choose brown rice instead of white rice. But remember brown rice will cost 1 dollar extra. The server did not tell us before we made that selection.  The size of the restaurant is not spacious. So it's not really a good place for a big group to go.  Overall, the food taste fine. But it's won't be my to go place next time.",
