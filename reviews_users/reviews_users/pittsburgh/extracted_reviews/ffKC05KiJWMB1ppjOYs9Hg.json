I've only ordered carry out but the decor is nice enough and I've never seen it really crowded. My daughter likes the Shrimp Pad Thai, and so far, I've had Panang Chicken and Red Curry Chicken. We have no complaints. The spice is adequate, probably a level 5 out of 10 but if you want more spice just say so and they will accommodate (I usually get 8). The employees are always friendly and food is ready quickly (10-15 min). Easy to park and convenient location.",

    "text": "A note about this area, rather than the restaurant itself: The parking in this little strip area is TERRIBLE. Be prepared to look around in the parking garage for a bit.  My friend and I got here a little after 1, slightly before the lunch rush began. We were greeted by the hostess, who was very friendly, and seated quickly; she and the server, Timmy, offered us suggestions since we had never been here before. We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, a pot of Jasmine hot tea, the Tom Kha Noodle Soup with shrimp, Spicy Basil Fried Rice with chicken, Green Curry with vegetables, and Spicy Pumpkin Curry with beef. We shared everything, and dishes and utensils for sharing were provided; the food came in \"courses\"; the drinks and soup were very prompt, and the main dishes came while we were eating our soup.  Both of us were very impressed with the quality of the food, for the most part, and my friend is VERY choosy about her Thai. The iced tea was fairly good, and the brewed tea was unremarkable, as was the fried rice--the soup and curries were where this place really shone. I especially appreciated the nicely cooked pumpkin. And the lean, tender beef that seems to be so hard to get right in restaurants. They're good at gentle, flavorful spice that doesn't hurt to eat.  Service was quick and friendly, the decor was nice but unremarkable, the place wasn't too busy, and the price was pretty good: the whole meal cost a bit over $48 with lunch prices. Some of the only Thai food my friend has actually enjoyed in years. We'll definitely be returning!",

The others at my table were all vegetarian and ordered Chiang Mai curry, and a veggies/basil sauce dish, forget what it was called on the menu.  My veggie companions don't like tofu, and it was a 2 minute conversation with our waitress before she understood that we wanted the orders made vegetarian, but without tofu.  She also left our table without a word in the middle of a small pause in us giving our order.  She went to the cashiers stand to put in what we'd placed so far, and then went to the kitchen area.  It was 5 minutes before she returned to take the rest of our order.  None of us were asked how spicy we would like our dishes, and they were universally bland.  Not a single speck of chili on my See Ew noodles.  I asked for hot sauce and was given Sriracha, while while delicious, doesn't really set the tongue on fire.    No reason to go here over the multitude of other Thai restaurants within a 5-10 minute drive.  The place was relatively full on a Friday night, I have to believe it's just people trying it out for the first time...",

The food was mediocre, the portions were small, and the prices were high. I'd be happy to forgive one of the three, but it's hard to like a place that fails on all of these. My Pad Thai, which I was requested to be spicy, was fairly bland, and the vegetables were tough. The flavor just wasn't right. I also tried the Pad Se Ew and Thai Fried Rice, which were similar. The ambiance was non-existent (hopefully, they'll eventually add some music or something). The people working were nice and fairly attentive, but that couldn't make up for the flavor, portions or prices.  Bottomline is that if you want Thai food, go to any of the places in nearby Squirrel Hill. If you're in Bakery Square and just want something to eat, go to Social where you can get some reasonable food and a beer for the same price as an entree at Asiatique.",

Both dishes were better than the rubbish that comes out of other supposedly Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh (except for the excellent Nicky's Thai). So that's a plus. However, being better than severely mediocre (or worse) places nearby isn't a good compliment.   Worth a try? Yes. Worth going out of your way? Probably not.  One thing I noticed was that the menu was relatively short and was missing some Thai mainstays like stirfry dishes. Hopefully that will come in due course. And hopefully the owner, who is from Thailand, will see an opportunity here to not only provide \"healthy\" Thai but to also introduce more authentic dishes that one would expect to eat if visiting Thailand.",

I suspect if it weren't so clean and attractive inside, there would be fewer complaints about authenticity- people tend to assume a dive is more \"real\" ;)  if you want something to be extra spicy, order it \"Thai hot\" and you won't be disappointed.",

The food is worse than grocery store thai - limp grey noodles, sorry old vegetables. Only the green beans seemed fresh - they were in everything so they must have been on sale. The lemongrass soup was OK. The papaya salad was not terrible. Noodles and curry however, take a pass. We wanted to be regulars but instead this was our one and only time in.",

The decor is fine - not spectacular, but better than average for the type of restaurant.  My only complaint was that walking in the front door, it smelled a little of bleach and mop water...not very appetizing.      The menu had a bunch of options.  We tried the King Chicken and the Lemongrass Beef.   The server didn't ask at all about spice levels and I forgot, so we got what we got.  My mom's chicken was way too spicy for her and my beef was sort of bland.  We switched dishes and were both happier.  Both meats were overcooked, but the sauces were enjoyable (again, once we switched dishes).     The service was so so.  Not horrible, but nothing to write home about.   We had to wait kind of a while for the check given that it was a weekday lunch.   It wasn't crowded even though everything around it looked to be.",

As I tend to be a little sensitive with spicy food, I asked the waitress about various dishes and their spiciness level and ended up ordering the pad thai with shrimp, which was quite tasty and had plenty of shrimp although it still had the tails .  My husband being the spice lover got the pumpkin curry with chicken, which came with some brown rice and per reports was really good.   We also ordered the spring rolls for the table and those were nice a crispy and were served with a tasty sweet sauce.  As we were finishing our dishes the owner came to our table to ensure that every one in our party was pleased, which was pretty nice. The wait staff was also very helpful in order to help me find a dish that I would like due to my lack of spice tolerance.  Overall I enjoyed the experience and would return. Oh and BTW this place is BYOB.. so bonus for that!!",

It's extremely clean and modern and I found the two clocks (one for Pittsburgh and one for Thailand) amusing because Thailand is exactly 12 hours ahead of our Eastern time zone. The service was decent, though the one waiter seemed a bit overwhelmed, the food was fresh and bright.  We ordered the avocado summer rolls, the drunken noodles, and the thai basil fried rice. All dishes were quite good, the fried rice was not as spicy as expected, but it's probably better than being too spice. Definitely better than some of the Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. As far as price goes, I paid a little more than I would've liked to, but it's Bakery Square and the rent for the restaurants are considerably higher than the run down places elsewhere in Shadyside/East Liberty.   The smoothie menu looked great, so I will have to visit when it isn't ten degrees outside. Also, it's BYOB.",

I've eaten at at least 80 Thai restaurants in my life, in different cities and countries, including in Thailand. This place was highly disappointing - disappointing enough to motivate me to get on Yelp and write a review after working a shift from 6am to 6pm. The $13.50 drunken noodle tasted super bland despite being ordered at 10/10 spiciness. They didn't even use the proper flat noodle for a drunken noodle dish. The noodle's texture felt like the ones you get from instant noodle packs. It also tasted like your average, bland fast food Chinese Chow Mei/Fun. There was no taste. They also give small proportion considering their price. There was a musty odor at the entrance of the restaurant when I went to pick up my order too. The interior design of the store was pleasant though. However, it did feel like they were overcompensating with their excessive Thai symbols in the restaurant - map of Thailand, picture of Thai king (found in almost every Thai person's house), Thai background music, and a bunch of other Thai antiques. It made me feel as if they were compensating for not really being Thai. LING Robinson is also not a Thai name and judging by the drunken noodle, I doubt that this place is Thai owned. It's common to have other nationalities capitalize off of Thai's notoriety in food and that's fine as long as the food at least resemble Thai food. On the wall of the restaurant, it said that she's made multiple appearances on TV and \"has fans approaching her at random health food markets asking her for tips.\" What a joke! Instant noodles taste better than her recipe and cost 50x less. They are abusing customers who aren't aware of how Thai food is supposed to taste.",

    "text": "Just had dinner here. I've been wanting to try this place for a while. There weren't a lot of people there which made it better to get our food quicker. The atmosphere was quiet but not bad. The place looked clean, too. I ordered the Lemon Grass soup as an appetizer with chicken and coconut milk (you have a choice of vegetable, chicken, or shrimp and with or without coconut milk). It was really good! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would've liked a big portion of it, to be honest. My main meal was the spicy basil tofu and it was good. I've had better spicy basil, but I enjoyed the veggies the most that came in the meal. It just wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked and they skimped on the Thai basil. I really enjoyed my soup better than my main course.   My friend got one of the main course soups and I tried the broth and that was tasty. I would go back for one of their noodle soups, for sure, I think that's probably what they make best.   ***I wanted to update my review to also say that no other Thai place I've been to makes better Tom Kha soup than here!",

Everyone's right: the flavors not authentic and the portion size is pitiful for the price. I love Thai food and this place is terrible, even for Pittsburgh standards (I live in DC and have even been to Thailand). This is worse than your cheap, Americanized Chinese takeout.   I got the Chang mai noodles, but there were less than 10 pieces of broken noodles in a swampy mess of tomato-paste broth and vegetables. I usually don't complain about portions because I'm a petite girl, but this was ridiculous. I requested more noodles, which they did provide.  I really wish this place could be my go-to Thai place because of the location, but there are just way too many better Thai places here for my hard earned money.",

There were actually peanut halves (vs chopped) in the pad thai which made the Pad Thai have a stronger peanut flavor. However, there were quite a few of just the shrimp tails in the pad thai in addition to actual pieces of shrimp. The green curry was good but didn't seem like the flavors were fully developed.   Not a bad thai place at all, and they are good with their quantities for the money but not one of my favorite places. But, I am glad I tried it.   I will say the inside looked like a very nice place to kick back and have a nice dinner if I was dining in inside of ordering take-out.",

The beef satay was kind of dry but still good.  Perhaps there's a reason beef satay isn't common? The white rice was definitely rinsed and cooked to perfection: a chewy bite with optimally stickiness. My only culinary suggestion for improvement was that the curry was predominantly green beans and I feel other vegetables needed greater representation.  Additionally my pickup order was ready maybe 8-10 minutes later than they predicted.  I'm still very satisfied and will go back.",

Because I was so excited to try it, I waited until it opened and ordered some takeout.   Their menu is a decent size, so of course I was contemplating ordering something different than what I normally do. I usually go with Pad Thai, or pineapple fried rice. If It ain't broke, don't fix it. I knew I couldn't go wrong with my usuals. I chose to go with the pineapple fried rice this time around. I also got some Thai egg rolls on the side.   The food was ready in about 20 minutes. It was so fresh and good. The spring rolls were nice and crispy yet, juicy and soft. The pineapple fried rice had the perfect mix of sweet and salty that I like. The only thing that I didn't like is the fact that the pineapple fried rice comes with shrimp. I hate shrimp. But I simply pushed them to the side, and continued to eat my rice because it was so good. I would definitely go here again.",

    "text": "First, I should mention that I am a Thai food fanatic. I've tried many Thai restaurants in different cities and I've tried 6 different ones in Pittsburgh so far. I was going to order dinner from my current favorite Thai restaurant in the area but decided to try Asiatique in the hopes of finding another great food place. Sadly, this has to be the most inauthentic Thai food I have ever had.   I got food to-go from here so I can't comment on their service but their food was not what I expected at all. The restaurant itself looks nice inside but ultimately if you're in the food business, the food matters most. The drunken noodles had egg noodles (not the flat rice noodles that are used in this dish) and bean sprouts (???? I've never heard of bean sprouts in drunken noodles). There were also no tomatoes and the spices used in the dish tasted like the McCormick spices you can buy at any grocery store.   It may not seem like a huge difference, but overall the dish tasted no different than an order of chicken with noodles from my neighborhood chinese fast-food.  With that being said, it wasn't absolutely terrible if you enjoy that specific taste but I couldn't give more than 1 star because they charged $12.50 for Chinese food that I can buy for 5 bucks.   If you're planning on going here with friends or on a date, keep in mind that this food isn't really Thai food and you may be disappointed with the taste, especially considering the price. I guess the only positive thing I can comment on is that the place is pretty so your instagram/Fb pictures will look nice.   P.S. If this is your first time ever trying Thai food, please try another place first. I know if I had a bad first experience with it, I probably wouldn't have a favorite cuisine today. A good way to tell if the food will taste like authentic Thai food is if either the owner or the cook is Thai.   Good luck!!",

If you're staying at the Springhill Suites in Bakery Square, you can duck in easily to this spot for really good food.  One downside: on the weekends, they only serve dinner-size portions, even at lunchtime.  That meant we had to pay a premium even for lunch, and nobody finished their entire meal. If you're traveling, that means wasted food.   So I'd say it was a 4-star meal, but lost a star for me because I had to pay more even though the menu said there was a lunch-size portion available.",

I came here for lunch after the gym to keep my metabolism up and it started well. The place is cute, decked out in minimalistic Thai decor and some ambiance music. I was seated swiftly and supplied with water.  I ordered the Sun-Penang Curry to kick up my spice level a little which came quickly and looked quite pretty. I had mine with Chicken. However that is about all that can be said about it. The spice level was adequate for my white girl taste buds, however I am disappointed to say the chicken was overcooked and hard and so, of all things, was the rice. Hard rice is not a pleasant surprise.  The chicken within the curry was a little flavorless, the saving grace was the well done broccoli, however it was seconds from being overdone as well. The portion was a good lunch size, however the price would have expected much more on the plate. For the service I have nothing to complain about.  All together, very disappointing and will not return. Even with my love/hate relationship with Social, you are much better off wandering across the parking lot for it.",
