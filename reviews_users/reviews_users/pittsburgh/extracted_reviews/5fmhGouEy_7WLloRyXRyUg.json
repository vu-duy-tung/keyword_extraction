    "text": "This place has horrible customer service. I had a sandwich delivered last weekend. When I got it, it was completely made wrong. When I called the manager basically called me a liar but said he would send out a new sandwich in return for the old one. When the second sandwich came it was wrong as well. The manager again called me a liar. They never apologized for their mistake, nor did they offer to make it better. Two hours after I originally ordered they did however come pick up the second sandwich in return for a refund. So I was left at work with no food and a bad day. It has also been about 6 days and even though they sent a piece of paper stating the refund it has yet to show on my bank account. I feel as though they basically stole my 12$ since I never actually received any edible food AND they took both sandwiches back..... I will never order from there again and I do not recommend it. They were totally rude.",

When I came to pick up our order...I learned my mistake and the staff were very nice and accommodating and made us another pizza right away...didn't charge me anything extra. This tired traveler appreciated that courtesy. Pizza itself was yummy. Toppings are very generous. Tomato sauce might have been a little light for my taste but I bet they would go a little heavier had I asked. That said - not a slice leftover. I would order from them again. Seems like they offer coupons/ deals on fliers that aren't necessarily online so you might want to call and ask before you order.",

It's a mark above Police Station only because they have a menu that goes beyond just pizza.  Their bread sticks are some of my favorite. They are very buttery and garlicky with crumbled Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Pizza Milano may be a big fish in a small pond but I still think it could compete with the pizza downtown. It's not nearly as greasy as Mineo's and the toppings are just as fresh. The types of pies they put on their menu are also very unique. The Ultimate Meat is incredible and even includes lamb as a topping!",

I have tried literally 100's of pizzas, with my preference being thin crust Napolitano style, simple, fresh with a crispy bottom and tender crust. I decided to try Pizza milano because of the reviews stating it was very good and NY style. Well I went in and sat down for what seemed to be a long time and realized that you had to place your order at the counter and they bring it to you. A sign would have been nice lol So i ordered the medium pizza with Capicolla and mushroom. Their medium is alot bigger than alot of Larges by me in MI which was good. The Pizza to me tasted more like a traditional hand tossed with a very thick outer crust ring . The sauce was freah but there was alot of it. I wish the bottom would have been more crisp however. The dough was good but didnt have the standard olive oil taste that im used to. All and all it is very good pizza and im glad i tried it. Prices seem right to me for the amount I received.",

Food - The pizza is very \"bready\" - not my favorite.     I ordered a pizza loaded and by the time I returned to my hotel it was a soggy mess.    If you like a think crust pizza (not pan but more like a pizza sitting on Focacia Bread - then this is the place for you).    My likings are more thin crust and can hold the wait (i.e. anti-soggy pizza).  Service - The service was great!   The people at the restaurant were very nice and they were very busy.  Cost - This place is a little higher than the chains but they have much more variety.  I think if I was going to eat there again, I would try some of their other itmes.  You may like as many others but I will probably follow some other recommendations on my pizza quest in Pittsburgh.",

He told me that they were SO busy tonight and that it would take over an hour and a half to get there. I said ok, and he said fine see you at 1:30 then! I said alright, I'd like to pay with a card. He then said hold.. threw the phone down and then talked about me with another employee and said \"Get her card, it's 11:30 and she wants to order food.\" To which the female employee said \"I can't believe how many people are calling in tonight.. this is ridiculous.\" So I cancelled the order when she finally got on the phone.

    "text": "I have ordered from Pizza Milano regularly since I moved into my home in 2010 from the Robinson location.    Two weeks ago upon delivery I was given a lecture by the delivery driver to order from the Greentree location instead.  I did so twice ... today being the second time.  Tonight the delivery driver said it was too far for him and to order from the Robinson location.   You don't seem to want my business anymore ... the hundreds of dollars it has been ... including MORE than generous tips. Your prices are higher than most and your recent service level seals the deal that I will take my business elsewhere.",
