Gaby Et Jules' macarons are delicious and perfectly shaped; shows True talent by the chef I think. I tried: coffee earl grey  lemon lavendar rose pistacio  Fillings are very delicious, and they're pretty sweet so while they're expensive, as dessert you probably would only have 2 max at a time (I think at least). Would be great with an indulgent tea with the girls. Best eaten same day I think, but you can refrigerate as they say and let it come back to room temp before you eat. It's not quite as snappy/crispy the next day, but it's not a big deal.",

Not being familiar with French macarons, I purchased two of most everything. My wife and I thought the filling was a bit too sweet; our opinion... not sure if they are supposed to be that sweet.  Comments on Opera and Caramelia: very rich chocolate. Nice looking and tasty... but we like the products more at La Gourmandine on Butler Street. Warmer atmosphere, greater selection (no macarons, but that's ok).  Couple of people have commented on the prices; I agree that the prices are a little high for most of the items... not that we have much to compare them with.   A problem exists with the location: Forbes Avenue area parking is difficult to find if you just want to pop in for a snack.  Gaby et Jules will benefit from heavy sidewalk traffic, but lose on drive-by traffic.   Overall, very nice... but there are other choices.",

Most of them have delightful, subtle flavors that almost melt in your mouth, but some of them are either very bland (vanilla, coffee) or really strong (rose, lemon).  Still...watch yourself... At over $2 each, your purchase will set you back. Since my palette is not always in such a \"sophisticated\" state, Trader Joe's macaroons at less than 1/6th of the price are usually just fine for me.   The staff is very professional and friendly. We met one of the chefs once, and he was adorable--clearly very dedicated to his craft.",

I was a fan, but my husband didn't like them as much.  I felt that the rose flavored macaron was overpowering, but the others such as earl grey and strawberry, were much more balanced.  We also tried on of the pretty cakes (small one). I don't remember what the name was, but it was banana and chocolate.  My husband loved this.  I found the texture too soft, but the flavors were delicious.  The last thing we tried was a pain au chocolat.  I liked it and thought the chocolat was very high quality, but I thought it was not as crunchy and flakey as I would have liked.    I can't wait to go back and try some more things",

I wanted something small, so I bought a couple of the macarons. The pistachio flavored one was good. I could actually taste the flavor of the nut, and the filling was not too sweet. The rose flavored macaron however, was way too sugary. I cringed halfway trying to finish it. A little sugar actually goes a long way people, and if the sugar overwhelms the person...how can they get a taste of the other flavors in the dessert?! I would probably come back to try some of their other desserts, which I didn't get a chance to try. Hopefully it's not just pure sugar mixed in with food dye. I still have hope for you Gaby Et Jules, please don't disappoint!",

    "text": "Yum!  Very good macarons in a cute shop in a great little neighborhood.  My brother-in-law and his family live in Squirrel Hill and said that we needed to visit this shop when we were in town, so we picked up a dozen macarons and a small orange tart for dessert one night.  The macarons were tasty--maybe not the best I've ever had, but certainly very good.  Of the ones we tried, chocolate and coffee were probably my favorites.  Peach-lavender and raspberry were also good, and I don't usually like lavender-flavored things.  Since we were there late in the day, they were out of pistachio, which is one flavor I usually judge a new macaron place by.  Wuh wuh.  The orange tart was basically dreamsicle-flavored.  Yum.  The crust was nice and light, as was the filling.  I was so bummed that I accidentally dropped the tart upside down, as they didn't offer me a bag to carry our 2 boxes.  Not sure what's up with that, but word to the wise...ask for a bag.  The macarons and tart cost just over $30 altogether, so you want your desserts to be intact when you get home!    Service was friendly, and when I made a very sad face upon being told that they were out of chocolate macarons, someone appeared from the back with more!  :)  How nice.  Got to try their baguette and pain au chocolat the next day.  Very good.  Of course, not as good as in Paris, but hey--we aren't in Paris, are we!  Overall, I'd recommend Gaby et Jules for getting your French pastry fix on.",

The flavors were good but not \"oh my god this is amazing!\". I'd go back but go out of my way to head back.

Gaby and Jules are very friendly.  This place, however, gets a 3 in my book because it is expensive. Individual macaroons are $2.25 each, a half dozen can be had for $13 .

She generously purchased the 7 for $15 for me, and the family and I tried so many flavors!  The violet was extremely strong, and I don't know if I could handle that again.  However, the chocolate, the salted caramel and the mango were all delightful!  The white chocolate basil was a little peculiar for my tastebuds as well, but I'm pleased with the texture and presentation of the macarons.

The flavors were were really pronounced, unlike a lot of other macarons I've had elsewhere where they don't really taste like anything. My favorites were the pistachio and almond. My least favorite were the earl grey (flavor was accurate, just not big on tea) and poppy (tasted like the jelly out of a jelly donut... ick).   One thing though is that these are really pricy. Probably the most expensive macarons I've had yet, but they were worth it for the most part.  Also, the amount of reviews calling these things macaroons makes my head hurt.

It's like an almost overdone, crunchy, caramelized doughy egg custard in a small bite sized form. They're super good in general and always excellent here.   In addition, their croissants, both the regular and chocolate versions, are 100% legit.   The last time I had a chocolate croissant this good was, in fact, in France, and while there are a few other French bakeries in Pittsburgh, neither of their chocolate croissants come close. Well, one does, and his shop deserves the respect it's earned over many decades. The other place, however, should stop selling them immediately, since it's ruined their credibility in my mind.

I have been to a lot better places for pastries and sweets.",

    "text": "!!Macaron tasting!!  Got 12 of the 18 available, also a canele.. very dense, moist in middle with crunchy caramelized exterior, an excellent balance between custard and dough.   The macarons are flaky, light, and balanced, at times too confectionary. By preference  1) coffee - starts doughy like phyllo, roast grows softly, warmly, growing but never overpowering, dense  2) Nutella - sweeter than chocolate, doughier in end, more complex  3) maple bacon - maple-bacon conjurs sticky images of 2000 calorie cavities. Not here! Balanced with actual bacon pieces  4) Caramel - more almond than caramel, high cream low sugar decent salt  5) Chocolate - dense but flavorful  6) Honey - not overly sweet, too much cream, light confectionary at finish  7) raspberry - heavy cream dairy overload up until late finish when raspberry bursts with seediness, then falls like a cliff  8) Pistachio - moderate confection up front, pistachio grows mid, dry medium body, moderate density  9) lemon - light density, sherbet heavy brightness mid, low sweetness but lemon inauthentic  10) almond - almond extract flavor, very sweet and synthetic, light  11) earl gray - lighter tea notes amidst confection, very creamy almost lime sherbet-like, less dense = more confectionary  12) white choc Basil - basil heavy, overwhelming, low chocolate/sugar, moderate cream, light",

They have a huge variety of different flavored macaroons, and the staff is incredibly friendly and ready to help answer any questions you might have.   I came here to pick up a pastry to surprise my fiance, but of course I couldn't leave without at least trying the macaroons. They're on the pricey side, so I decided to try three: lavender, raspberry, and almond. The lavender macaroon was very good. The flavor was okay but the macaroon itself was perfect. The inside was soft and creamy. The outside had a nice bite. My favorite, the almond one, was also perfect and the flavor was wonderful. The raspberry one missed the mark on consistency. It was sort of chewy and sticky, which isn't ideal for a macaroon. Hopefully this is an anomaly because the other macaroons were delicious.  As for the pastries, they were great. Not the best pastries I've had, but great nevertheless. My fiance's chocolate one was definitely a hit. I had the L'Opera one and the coffee flavor in the pastry was outstanding.  Definitely worth stopping in and trying a few flavors. I know I'll be back for the raspberry pastry over cream filling -- It was difficult NOT to buy it this time around!",

This place is pricey but I PROMISE, you will not regret trying any of the pastries.  I also had some Macarons and although the texture was executed well, the flavors missed the mark as they were very faint.   Macaron flavors I tried:  Raspberry  Pistachio  Almond  Poopy  Nougatine  Passion fruit White Basil Pineapple  Raspberry and Pineapple were the only flavors I could taste (slightly). Service was service. Young lady serving us looked snobbish and as if she needed a Pepsi to wake her up (I hate soda/Pepsi by the way)",

I would rather have an extra piece of meat or bread at the end of a meal, instead of dessert.  That being said, I had the honor and privilege of tasting one of Gaby et Jules macarons at a food event and they were FABULOUS!    After that tasting, my daughter, (Nicknamed Muff) begged me to take her to the actual patisserie in Squirrel Hill.  Indulgent mother that I am, we set our sights on the jewelry cases containing some of the finest macarons to be had in the country!  Yes, I said country!  I've had macarons at places said to be \"famous\" for their macarons and the macarons at Gaby et Jules outshone them by a long shot.    For someone who isn't into sweets to actually say that they dream of salty carmel or lovely raspberry macarons, is to say a lot!  To eat a whisp of flavored air and have it envelope your tongue in ethereal loveliness... Ah, what glory they are!  I can't wait to go back for more...",

    "text": "Bonjour! Permettez-moi de vous aider a vider votre portefeuille aujourd'hui!  Few pastries excite me as much as the ones at Gaby Et Jules patisserie.  I stopped by on a recent Friday afternoon.  The exterior of the shop is an incredible bright spot on Forbes Avenue.  Inside, the store is very clean, bright and tidy.  The display cases are full of carefully placed edibles, lined up like tiny jewels and magnificent works of art.  So elegant!  The shop really is quite over the top.  And I'm not just talking about the prices!  My wonderful Gaby girl patiently waited while I chose my macarons one at a time and carefully boxed them up for me.  Next came my pastry choices.  She was even too kind as to help me decide which to try.  She told me how every pastry is hand crafted in the traditional French way with no shortcuts.  I loved her accent and could have talked to her all day.  I can see that care goes into creating each puffy pastry.  Everything was perfectly packaged in bags and boxes with the super cool and very pretty GEJ insigna.  After many ohs and ahs, I was out the door.    Later, back at the ranch, it was time to enjoy my super duper indulgences.  The question was, where to start?  And who will help me?  BJ and the macarons won.  They were the right amount of crunchy goodness on the outside.  And the perfect gooey, fluffy, soft sweetness on the inside.  I am a fan of these tiny little pillows of delight-fullness. The little cookies were deliciousness in my mouth, I swear.  And well worth the splurge.  These treats seem to be straight from Heaven.  Later, came the froufrou French patisseries.  Never met a tartelette that I didn't love.  And I loved this one, topped with raspberries.  Another special treat was the Paris-brest.  I am a fan of the hazelnut flavored creme and the choux pastry was topped with powdered sliced almonds.  Another treat is their croissants.  I ordered a pain au chocolat and while they were not the very best that I have ever had, they were very good.  The crust was very flaky and shattered as I torn into it.  The interior was light as a feather, but not tough.  The layers inside were stretchy and would separate as I pulled with my fingers.  The flavor was buttery with a natural sweet goodness.   The fineries here are a wonderful splurge.  If you are craving something decidedly different, what better way to fulfilling this craving than to visit Gagy Et Jules!  Mon nouvel ami!  Je taime!",

The pastry chef must also be a pastry artist, because every item is beautifully and intricately decorated and super fancypants.  Yes, it's True, their macarons are delicious.  If you happen to pop in while they have the pumpkin macaron, make sure you try it.  It's absolutely out of this world.  I like their macarons better than Jean-Marc Chatellier's.  And yes, it's True, they will also cost you a pretty penny.  But if you are as much of a macaron enthusiast as I am, Gaby et Jules is worth the trek.  That said, I have tried one other thing here -- a pain au chocolat -- and it was much more expensive than La Gourmandine's and not as good.  Actually, I have a hard time imagining how some of their pastries could be better than the same pastries at La Gourmandine, and they are consistently at least 50% more expensive here.  So, although I have yet to give a few other \"benchmark\" items a try (I have heard that their baguettes are magnificent), I probably would not recommend getting your other pastries here unless you live in Squirrel Hill or you have a generous dessert budget.",

    "text": "Lovely little French bakery. What is it with me and French bakeries lately? Holy moly. My mum loves this place first and foremost for their macarons, it seems, but also for their pastries. Specifically those cute little cakes with the big price tags. We were just bitching about the prices earlier and then proceeded to spend about 50 clams on deliciousness. Oh well. I guess a lot of effort goes into making some of this stuff. I can understand charging a lot for macarons because I have made them before myself and yes, it's a huge PIA. lol. Oft times they don't come out right. Baking is truly a science. I am glad this place has a formula for kick-ass macarons down-pat.   Oh and the service--I have only been in once--but let me tell you, sweetest ladies working behind the counter. I love the accents and the French words and how they encourage us to attempt to pronounce words. Heehee. I am soooo bad at French. Every French person ever (particularly the linguists and teachers) are rolling in their graves every time I attempt to pronounce various words... oh well! But yeah, they were running low on macarons and were out of some flavors but when we asked, they went in the back to procure more. They are closed on Mondays and I was hellbent to try some of their delicacies. It was, of course, nearing 3:00pm today (Sunday) and that's when they close. Still, great service despite this. A+  Hard to say what things are my favorites... I know I did not like the banana cake thing but that's because I am not fond of banana to the extent that some people are... also their orange tart thingy was too orange-y for me. But if you like a certain flavor and you get a \"that\" flavor item, chances are, you will like it. A lot. E.g. I looove hazelnut and their hazelnut cake/torte/thing was FANTASTIC. Soooo good. And the pistachio cake? I devoured the entire thing in a minute. Agggh!  I had to pop a digestive enzyme after eating this rich amazingness but was totally worth any indigestion that may occur after.... their lemon macarons and the chocolate ones are my fave. Basil was freakin' delish as well as the Earl Grey macaron. How do they get such intense flavors all in one little cookie? IDK! And I wish so hard they were open Mondays as I am flying back to St. Louis tomorrow evening and they normally open quite early...I'd totally haul ass back there first thing tomorrow morning if I could and stock up for the flight home. Unffff. I guess I will have to wait until my next trip back to Pittsburgh!",

You won't find baguettes or croissants here, but that's ok because we need a place like in our lives. To show us what fine French pastry and dessert is all about! The quality of these goods is second to none, and you are getting the real deal. It's not a large bakery, and there is no indoor seating. There is some outdoor seating for when the weather allows. The interior feels fancy, but not gaudy. You walk in, peruse and take out. The bakery is visible in the back, so you can observe the chefs in action. They have a large selection of macarons, a variety of flavors.  The pastries are toward the front, with appropriate signage to tell you what they're made with and their price. This is so helpful because by looking at them you would definitely not know what kind of dessert they are- they're almost too beautiful to eat! Everything I have tried here was delicious, nothing has disappointed including the macarons. From the entrance to the packaging, the entire experience is excellent. This is the kind of store you see on high end 5th Ave. in New York City. It's pricey but worth the indulgence when you can.",

    "text": "In the past year, I have developed a bit of a love affair with macarons. Being home for Christmas, I knew I needed to see what Pittsburgh had to offer. I tried a half dozen.  White chocolate basil: basil heavy at first, but ended up being very good  Earl grey: great flavor, but I think mine had too much gel. This is not my preferred type of macaron filling, so I was a bit sad as Earl grey is usually my favorite flavor.  Le Pittsburgh: The Bailey's really comes through. Thumbs up from me. I don't know if the cookies were done differently, but they seemed especially tasty.  Lemon: strong flavor. More tart than refreshing. Not for me.  Sugar Plum (seasonal): A beautiful purple with sugar coating. Get it if you can!  A brown one: Okay, so I ate these the day after I got them and I couldn't remember my 6th flavor. There were a few tiny pieces of nut on the cookie. This was by far my favorite though!  Prices are comparable ($1 more for 6) to what I pay regularly in Cincinnati and the sizes are the same. G+J has a lot of interesting and unique flavors to keep you coming back.",

Though I haven't tried the macarons yet, I plan to do so very soon! Of the pastries I've tried, I haven't been disappointed in any one. Together with the bright, well-decorated interior, a trip to Gaby et Jules distinguishes itself from other outings in the Pittsburgh area. The price is a little bit expensive, but you really get what you pay for. Whenever I have something to celebrate, a lovely dessert from this shop is the first thing that comes to mind and I never regret it.",

I went in and picked out 6 macarons, expecting to pay for 3. When I was rung up, the server quoted me $13 and change. I asked why it was so much and only then did she tell me that the sale was only valid if I bought 12 macarons and got 12 for free. When I asked if it was too late to cancel the transaction, she told me I could either pick 18 more or pay full price for the 6 macarons. I didn't want 24 macarons, so I paid full price for the 6. If the sale was only on dozens of macarons, the sign in the window should say so! This is unethical. I'm sure the macarons will be tasty but that will not fix the bad taste in my mouth from this deceptive and frustrating experience.",

I've only tried a handful of the macaron flavors but all have been great and tasty so far. The white chocolate basil is my favorite, with the rose at a close second :) They typically also have a monthly flavor that is fun and new. The small pastries and cakes they offer are also beautifully decorated and extremely tasty. Got a white chocolate pear cake for my birthday a few months back and I almost felt bad digging in because of how perfect it looked!   One of the best things is taking someone from out of town here for the first time and seeing their face light up with the \"wow\" factor as soon as they walk in. Also gives me an excuse to splurge on a big box of macarons!",

Biting into a macarons with flavors such as salted caramel, raspberry, lemon, and earl gray while eyes closed makes you feel like you've been transported to the streets of Paris.  When you open your eyes, you're slightly disappointed, but can indulge in another treat.  Walking in, I'll be honest - I expected more... after all this is a French pastry shop.  The decor was a bit minimal, but the color of the macarons brightened things up.  I stopped in to grab dessert for myself and friends.  There was an assortment of pastries in front of me.  I asked for their preferences - the raspberry and lemon tarts were recommended.  How could I say no?  Along with the tarts, I took home 6 macarons.  The price was $27 - a bit high if I do say so.  When it came time to sample the tarts, a creamy vanilla custard was topped with fresh raspberries.  It wasn't overly sweet, but bright yet creamy.  Simply delicious.  Unfortunately the lemon tart was less desirable.  If I wanted something that tart, I would have bit straight into a lemon.  Though topped with meringue, it didn't have enough sweet or creamy to counteract that lemon flavor.  Perhaps I'll stop in again for macarons or another delicacy.  I'll partake in anything... but lemon.",

There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from! Chocolate, vanilla bean, raspberry, lemon, earl grey, salted caramel....rest assured, I tried them all.

The first thing you notice as soon as you walk in is that they have presentation down to a science--all of the pastries are super visually appealing.  Likewise, they have great packaging that dresses up the pastries nicely.  However, all of this comes at a price, since the prices here are at least 2x that of the nearby competition (La Gourmandine, Jean-Marc).  In light of that, you might ask whether the pastries are worth the price differential, esp. in terms of quality.  Unfortunately, my answer to this is no, not really.  The following three items cost me over $25: six macarons, le sensation, and plaisir sucre.  For the macarons, I ordered the following flavors: chocolate, lemon, Pittsburgh, blueberry, cherry, and sugar plum (Dec. special).  While I didn't have the problem that some reviewers had with the flavors being too subtle, the quality didn't match that of Jean-Marc's macarons.  The sensation, which consisted of white chocolate mousse and lemon creme, was light and delicious, and was the most unique pastry of the bunch.  The plaisir sucre consisted of a hazelnut sponge cake covered with chocolate mousse, which was in turn enrobed in chocolate ganache.  Despite all of the chocolate layers, it wasn't as chocolatey or as complex in flavor as I was hoping.  While all of the pastries I purchased here were good, they just didn't match the quality or the pricing of the nearby competition.  If you're looking for sweets that are visually appealing and are willing to pay a premium for that, then you'll surely enjoy Gaby et Jules.  However, if you're budget conscious like me, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere to get your French pastry fix.  3.5 stars.",

At Gaby Et Jules, I have tried 14 flavors so far, including earl grey, raspberry, almond, etc...  I find the price of these little treats average. While pricy when compared to similar treats, they are on-par for the pricing of a good macaron.  The flavor profiles are interesting, and most of the time quite good. If there was to be a complaint, it would be that sometimes (in certain macarons) the flavor is quite muted. This is a personal issue, and does not mean that they are not good by any means.   As for texture & proportion: The outside \"biscuit\" section of the macarons have the proper texture... slightly crunchy shell... and the inside cream filling was found to be a good proportion. The filling is also smooth, light, and silky in texture. As expected, a proper macaron should somewhat melt in your mouth.   The ambiance of the shop reminds me somewhat of previous french bakeries that I have been in, but perhaps just a bit more \"pretentious\" - perhaps from pride of their product. This didn't bother me at all. I rather expect it.",

I tried several flavors of the macarons including sea salt caramel, vanilla and earl gray - all of which were underwhelming. Good texture but the taste was lacking. I was most disappointed w/ the sea salt caramel (my favorite macaron flavor ever!) because the filling tasted like cheap cake frosting.   $2.25 for a tiny macaron is pretty steep, especially since I pay $1.75 in San Francisco, $2.75 in NYC (at Lauderee) and $1.25 in Columbus for a better macaron. I don't mind paying premium prices for desserts (given my huge sweet tooth) but the macarons at Gaby et Jules are just not worth it.  Also, I cannot believe the almond croissants here are $5.50! The ones over at La Gourmadine are $3.75 (?) and amazing.  I had such high hopes for this bakery especially since it is within walking distance from my apartment, but I don't think I will be back.",

Clean, small, lovely, and you can see the full kitchen and chefs baking away behind glass.  It's just wonderful. Onto the desserts...  DIVINE!  I purchased an assortment of delicacies for my holiday party, from macarons to tiny tarts and pufed pastries.  Everything was delish and decorated beautifully.    My only critique is the price.  Yes, the items are specialty, but $3+ per macaron (unless you buy in bulk, b/c the price does go down) is a bit steep. $7 avg. per pastry?  I mean, this is still Pittsburgh.  These prices rival NYC.  Macarons are such a fad dessert right now that people forget that they aren't incredibly difficult to make, and the ingredients are pretty inexpensive.  That being said, they were very good... just overpriced in my opinion.  Overall, c'est magnifique! (I couldn't resist.)",

    "text": "Authentic Parisian patisserie? Can't say for sure. But Gaby et Jules certainly wouldn't be out of place if it were transported to Manhattan. Overall, I feel mixed about this shop. On the plus side, the food tastes pretty good and looks beautiful. On the down side, the shop is rather pretentious, and, arguably, overpriced.  I braved the line on its soft opening this past Friday and got: one croissant, one dessert, and four macarons. The croissant was very nice -- flaky, buttery, not doughy at all. It is, however, Americanized  in its size: probably twice as large as the breakfast croissants in France. Gaby et Jules offers an amazing array of jewel-like macarons. Although I have not been fanatic about this confection, G&J's alluring display still got me to try some. And they are very very good. Not too sweet, and the favors generally shine through -- if it's a coffee flavored one, expect strong espresso; if it's raspberry flavored, expect intense summer berry.  While the pastries at G&J may be easy on the eyes, they are not so easy on the wallet. A croissant is $3, the dessert is about $7, and each tiny macaron is $2. One can get similarly tasty treats at Jean Marc Chatellier's for half the price (G&J's macarons are probably a little more sophisticated, but JMC's food has an authentic rustic charm). To me, the main differences are: JMC's Millevale storefront is a great deal humbler; the shop is much harder to get to; their servers, while friendly, are not cute girls who speak with a charming French accent, and your pastries won't be as prettily packaged.",

Now I can run up to Forbes and grab delicious, fresh macarons whenever I want!  Because they are in the meat of their grand opening and are now taking orders for the holidays, make sure to stop by to sample some delicious treats. Make sure to get your order in quickly as they have a five day waiting period for some of their fancier concoctions.   I am so glad Pittsburgh has a True French patisserie. The bright candy apple red exterior is both fun and inviting. I couldn't resist adding a chocolate croissant before checking out, and I wasn't disappointed! Make sure to stop in and talk to the staff. They are extremely helpful, and can point you in the right direction, no matter what flavor profile you enjoy. They have equally delicious options for chocolate lovers and fruity types.",

They are perfectly crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Some flavors were very strong (which I mean in a good way - lemon for instance), some were pretty weak and I couldn't really tell what I was eating (raspberry which was a big shock.  J said the vanilla was too sweet as well.    I would likely return to taste the pastries which were beautiful to behold.  I just hope that they pack a bit more taste then the other beautifully done macarons.",

But, my indecision made a couple of the staff very nervous for some reason.  As I tried to make up my mind, one of the staff barked at my kids, \"Don't touch the signs.\"  We finally ended up with a variety of 8 macarons and a pain au chocolat.  Total pricetag: $20.70.  Yikes, that added up in a hurry.  The macarons were good.  Not easy to find in Pittsburgh so I guess this is going to be my default place even though the service isn't great and it just seems pricey for Pittsburgh.  My pain au chocolat - what it lacked in chocolate in made up for in butter in the croissant.  Just meh.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my fiance for a light snack.  This was actually the second time that we had been here although the first time was close to closing time right after they had opened so there was not much to see or buy.  This time around though, man were the display cases decorated with some beautiful food.  Everything about this place feels warm and inviting including the workers who seem to want to help you.  On my recent visit here I ended up ordering an Almond Croissant without really looking at the price.  So you can imagine my surprise whenever it cost me $5.50!  Granted I am more than happy to pay for really good food whenever it necessary and while this was good food, it wasn't great food.  The croissant did have a nice flaky texture to it and a good buttery taste with the outside  covered in sliced almonds. However,I would have been much happier going to another Pittsburgh's French bakeries and getting a superior almond croissant for half the price.  The previous time that I was here my fiance and I got 3 macaroons to split.  While I do not remember the flavors, I do remember enjoying them even if they did cost us a little bit each (I think around $2).  So why the 3 star review for food I clearly enjoyed you ask?  Well it certainly isn't for the interior of the shop which was awesome, nor is it for the customer service which I have found to be great on both occasions.  It is strictly based upon the prices and the fact that I can get what I think is a superior item for much cheaper at a couple of places that are not that far away.  The bottom line for me is that I might be back in the future but only if I am in the Squirrel Hill area and really craving something from a French bakery.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge fan of macaroons, but since my wife is gluten-free we sometimes stop here for a little different option for dessert than the ice cream/froyo places in Squirrel Hill.  The star of this place are the macaroons. They have a variety of at least 20 different flavors, from basics like chocolate to more esoteric like rose. They are all very well made and flavorful. We've never had one that was dry. They always seem to have the right mix of moistness and bite. I tend to stick with the more traditional; my favorites are caramel and lemon.  They are not cheap, however. $2+ per macaroon. You have to be careful as you can easily walk out $30-$40 lighter.   We haven't really tried any of the other items, but they do have a nice selection of other pastries and baked goods, again all very well presented.   I think this is a great place to pick something up a little more unique for dessert, but it is definitely not an everyday treat. It's a fun dessert for a group of people to try different flavors.",

It's beautiful inside -- shiny and clean, and the staff seem friendly. There's even a full wall window where you can watch the food being made.  The croissants seem roughly on par with those from French bakeries in town, and the macaroon I had was delicious albeit a little strange since it was basil and white chocolate flavored.Their almond croissant is tougher and less sweet than the like from, La Gourmandine, but still good.  Overall, I'm not sure it's quite as good as La Gourmandine or Jean-Marc Chatellier's, but it's definitely in a more convenient location for me, and to be fair, it's trying to fill a slightly different niche than the other ones. It's also brand-new, so they may have some kinks to iron out. It's a great addition to Squirrel Hill -- check it out today!",

It tasting nothing like rose. It tasted like almond. Any low quality macaroon will taste like almond regardless of the \"named flavor\" or color. We went back to the store and talked to the staff and shared our experience. They were nice enough to offer us to try another flavor. We asked which flavor had the strongest flavor. Of all thoce choices, she said \"Vanilla\". It says it all.   Our dear friends tried six different ones after us and said \"all of the flavors were mediocre and some of them you just couldn't tell what they tasted like.\"  I feel like they have no idea what they are doing and they are getting away with it. They assume Pittsburgh does not deserve better. It does!   This store would not survive a month in NYC or Paris or another metropolitan area.  The silver lining; nice staff.",

I was never a macaron lover until I visited the famous Bouchon Bakery in NYC and tasted what a fine work of art the macaron can be.  The sales associate was very friendly, and my husband and I tried a couple tasty samples. We settled on purchasing a half dozen macarons (for $13) and selected lavender, pistachio, white chocolate basil, Le Pittsburgh (which I believe was Bailey's?), and two of the Sea Salt. My two favorite macarons were the Sea Salt - so happy we got two - and the pistachio. Unfortunately, both the lavender and the white chocolate basil macarons were pretty soft and mushy.   I really wanted to give Gaby Et Jules rave reviews, but after spending over $2 per macaron, I thought that having a couple poorly prepared macarons in the mix just wasn't acceptable.",

I would patronize Gaby et Jules more often if they did not repeatedly overdo the packaging.  Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.  P.S. I recommend Gourmandine bakery in Hazelwood or Lawrenceville as an alternative. Their almond croissants are superb, and they'll serve you on china. Less pretentious, less expensive, and greener.",

I ordered a set of 18 macaroons in a heart shaped box to be sent to my sweet as a loving Valentine's Day surprise. The delivery was your standard 2 day priority mail but sadly USPS botched my present and the cookies arrived damaged, chipped and banged up. I BLAME USPS!   I then emailed Gaby Et Jules in within hours received a reply back that a replacement order would be shipped at no extra charge. To my great surprise a second order was then hand delivered to my boyfriend's job the next day. I repeat hand delivered.  I ask you \"where they do that at\"? and on top of that a couple weeks later my boyfriend made me aware that he also got a personal phone call from Gaby Et Jules inquiring about his satisfaction with the macaroons.  I feel so valued and just amazing so much so that I sent a personal hand written thank card to expression my appreciation.",

I always bring home different desserts when I drive back home to see my family. They absolutely love it :-D",

    "text": "By far the best bakery in Pittsburgh, Gaby et Jules makes excellent macarons. I always stop in if I am in Squirrel Hill or I drop by the counter in Market Square. Earl Grey, White Chocolate Basil, and that one with apricot are my go-to favorites, but you really can't go wrong no matter what you choose. I also recommend the canele, which is caramelized on the outside and custardy on the inside. To top it all off, the quality is great, but I've never had more than one or two people ahead of me in line and the prices are very reasonable compared to macarons I've had in the $3-4 range. It's nice to have a great French bakery and not have to wait in lines - the perks of being in a smaller city!",

However, there's just something about the texture that I absolutely love, along with the unique flavors as well.   First time I actually made it into this bakery, although I have had them before. Unique setup, friendly staff, and excellent sweets outside of the macaroons. I tried the lemon tartlette which was fantastic.  Macaroons will cost you about $2.25 a piece and are relatively small, but certainly not overpriced. Market District sells larger ones for about the same price and I enjoy them as well, but these guys win on flavor options alone.",

On a recent trip to Paris (my first ever) I made the adventure to try Macaroons. It seemed like the thing to do. I loved them. They were soft, moist, and a lovely balance of even flavor throughout the pastry.   After having Macaroons in France, I was sure nothing could compare. Not even the highly coveted Gaby et Jules. Again, I was wrong.   A six pack comes at a hefty price, but in my humble opinion these Macaroons are just as good as the ones I ate in Paris.

You'd think the macaron would be flawless since that's what they specialize in but half of it was stuck on the presentation plate and it was just hard and not flakey like a macaron. I'm not saying they tried to imitate la gournandine's big macaron but I want to say if you're expecting that quality you won't get it from here. I am someone who enjoys bakeries A LOT and this is one of my least favorites. For a French bakery I am very disappointed!",

If you can't tell how EXCEPTIONAL the macaron and other pastries are then you should go to a local grocery store or somewhere else where institutional baked goods are offered. The chef is from PARIS and is a master-- clearly he puts his heart and soul into the creation of the finest pastries available and we are lucky enough to have this shop in Pittsburgh! The attention to detail and presentation is worth a little extra it seems to me and I don't mind paying a little more for a special and elegant treat that is of this caliber. I've been to Paris and love the fact that I only have to travel a short distance for an authentic French pastry (the real deal in my opinion). I highly, highly recommend and wish this particular patisserie every success because they deserve it!!!",

There were many choices and it looked like they were set up for takeout and for large orders for holiday parties.    So we got two items to go for over $9.  That seemed steep but I was in a splurging mood.  The ordering process seemed awkward and left me feeling uneasy.  The item I ordered comes in a small plastic cup similar to a shot glass.  It had a crumb topping.  It was placed in a box meant for macarons and didn't quite fit.  By the time I got it home those crumbs spilled out.  Now, why sell something to go with no way of transporting it? I would have eaten it on the way to the car if a spoon was offered.   And for the taste? Just so-so.",

But Gaby et Jules is more than macarons. They have an assortment of desserts that are *almost* to pretty to eat. But you should definitely eat them.  My boyfriend suggested going in for dessert. Everything was shiny and gorgeous and some of the colors were so vibrant they looked more like candy than pastries. Ultimately, I shied away from the technicolor gelees and opted for a poached pear cheesecake and some kind of chocolate-on-chocolate mousse but let me be clear: they didn't look like cheesecake and mousse. Each was a work of art. Although there is a cafe table out front, there is no seating inside the shop so we took our selections to-go. Both were amazing, but the chocolate-on-chocolate was a little less interesting. The pear dessert had an amazing blend of textures and was truly a delight.  It's not an every day thing, but if you are looking for something special and fun this place is worth checking out. I do kind of wish you could eat there and maybe have a coffee or tea with it, but I guess that's not really what they are going for.",

    "text": "Gaby et Jules, why have I put off coming here for so long?  The day I moved to Squirrel Hill, about a year and a half ago, I met the owners.  They were out on the corner of Shady and Forbes giving away free macarons.  This was my first experience with a macaron I actually enjoyed.  Most people seem to like them sickly sweet, and I prefer a light flavor.  It may have taken me some time to come back, but I will make up for it now.  My dad and I had lunch at Pizza Bellino, and we wanted dessert.  Usually, we just go to Commonplace for a coffee, but we decided to test Gaby et Jules out.  I started with a sample of the Le Sensation, which was lemon cream and white chocolate mousse on top of lemon-almond dacquoise.  I really enjoyed it and would consider ordering it in the future.  However, we ordered the Royal Chocolat ($5.90) and the Tartelette aux framboises ($5.50).  The Royal Chocolat contained chocolate genoise, chocolate mousse, chocolate miroir glaze, and a gold leaf.  It is basically like eating whipped dark chocolate covered in liquid dark chocolate.  There was a dark chocolate square with gold decorations on the end as well.  It was awesome.  The Tartelette was a huge number of raspberries on top of a pastry cream.  There was a Gaby et Jules logo on top made out of white chocolate, which was amazing.  While I was waiting for my order, I watched the pastry chefs in the back work on the desserts, which was super cool.  While there is no seating inside, they do have two outdoor tables and were happy to supply me with napkins and utensils.  As to the people who prefer La Gourmandine, I am in the opposite camp.  I have always found Gourmandine's goods to be dry and stale.  I also think the price point for the goods here is better than Gourmandine, despite being about double.  The desserts here are so much more beautiful, larger, and fresh in my experience.  I would rather get dessert half the time and come here than go to the competitors and not enjoy my dessert as much.  While the price tag is steep, Gaby et Jules is a great treat to honor a special event or occasion.",

    "text": "J'adore Gaby Et Jules macarons. So many different flavors to choose from with such cute packaging. I enjoyed my staple macaron flavors - coffee, salted caramel and pistachio. Great colors (especially the electric green pistachio) and excellent flavoring on the fillings. I thought it was adorable how they had their own unique Pittsburgh macaron - Le Pittsburgh - which was half yellow and half black to represent the Steeler nation. Basically all the flavors I usually get from macaron shops - I liked. Gaby Et Jules bakes their macaron cookie shells to perfection as they are moist with a delicate \"crunch\". I'm using \"crunch\" for lack of a better word because the macarons here do not actually make a \"crunch\" sound as they are pretty soft. It's always a disappointment to receive hollow shelled macarons as they are difficult to make but none of my macarons from here had that problem. I decided to be adventurous and try Earl grey, rose, and vanilla basil and hated all of them. That doesn't take away any stars though because that's more of a preference thing. I'm just meant to like the basics. I thought the rose flavored macaron was too fragrant and I really felt as if I bit into a rose flower. My simpleton tastebuds could not comprehend the combination of vanilla and basil and thought it was too strong of a macaron. The earl grey macaron was gorgeous, however, left a bad taste in my mouth.   I actually didn't get a chance to stop by this storefront but instead went to the small Gaby Et Jules inside Market Street Grocery. They get their macarons from this main storefront though so I figured it made more sense reviewing the main store as opposed to reviewing Market Street Grocery.",

My boyfriend who doesn't like desserts lives macarons since I showed them to him and he loves Gaby et Jules ! I had my first macarons in St Maarten in 2013. I've been obsessed ever since. I find them where-ever I go all over the world. Who knew this little shop in Pittsburgh pa would be such a luxury. The filing inside these macarons are really what gets me. The salted caramel in particular. It is creamy and buttery and so flavorful. I do not know how they do it. I've been to laudree in Paris and these honestly are even better. The flavor is to die for and the smooth sweet taste is just unbelievable. They are perfectly made. They have the perfect outer shell crunch with a soft inside that a True macaron is supposed to have. They aren't too thick. Always uniform in size and no bumps or bubbles. The feet are perfect on the shells. And no matter what nothing beats that filing. Whether you're a macaron fanatic like me, a dessert lover, or anyone even if you don't like desserts (like my boyfriend) you need to come here and try these because they are phenomenal and anyone will love them. Bravo!",

    "text": "Let us remove the most obvious out of the way, shall we?  Yes, the price tag is high versus going to say a Dunkin Donuts or your local coffee shop for ho-hum sweet stuff.  Gaby et Jules dishes out high quality desserts with ornate decorations that could double as works of art.  I visited Pittsburgh for a week and dropped in at least three times to sample several of their treasures.  First of all, none of these desserts should be transported and left in a hot car or left unrefrigerated.  The creme, gels, and filllings will melt down and you'll be sad to have spent your hard earned dollars on a small colorful puddle; treat them as though they are ice cream servings.  The macarons can keep longer but they too should be eaten when cool to experience the outer shell crunch and soft, inner layer of subtle flavors.  So, my selections consisted of:  1) Le Croustillant Aux 3 Chocolats - basically a combination of three different chocolates that are smooth like mousse with hints of hazelnut, and less sweet than your average chocolate milk.  Unbelievably delicious.  2) La Jolousie - soft texture, perfect blend of Bavarian creme, strawberry gel, mint panna cotta layered on a Madeleine crust with a touch of almond.  Dessert wet dream has just occurred!!   3) Bavarois - at first glance, a red velvet cake?  Nope, the fruit custard top and what I imagine is close to an airy pound cake as its base.  Good, but not my favorite.  4) Apricot and panna cotta swirl cup - not the actual name but it describes exactly what it is.  An apricot gelee and panna cotta mix never gets too sweet and hits a home run for me on the third visit.  The plastic spoon easy breaks through the layers and the two flavors are an ideal match.  It is so light that even when you are too full for dessert, it will still fit in your belly.  If you got the extra few bucks to spare and want perfection, look no further.",

    "text": "Can't believe I haven't written a review yet.  I've been here so many times, sampled the majority of what they have to offer, and every. Single. One. Is. Good. Great, even. Awesome, arguably. Probably tried just about all of the pastries. And a large percentage of their macaron flavours.  The Millefeuille is a light, flaky, custardy treat topped with a sweet sugar rush that is somehow hard to be sick of. Almost buy this thing regularly.  Le Royal is the elegance and seduction of deep, dark chocolate itself. Even it's twisted, angular, shiny body mocks me from memory.  Fruity flavours like Feronia and Bavarois (which may vary seasonally) always bring a fun tang to the tastebuds.  And this place has fun with making special treats for special events and the holidays, too. Mother's day, Christmas, sports-related et cetera. I've just finished the last slice of the pistachio-flavoured Galette des Rois they're offering for January and I am very, very satisfied. This place has mastered flakiness paired with creams and flavours.  The best part is, each little thing is still relatively affordable and comes in presentable boxes and bags, which is just the perfect balance between the sort of thing you can get once in a while when the fancy strikes, and something you reserve for special occasions.  The only thing I'm not sure they top for me are the macarons. Don't get me wrong, they're very good. And some of them have fun flavours I haven't seen elsewhere. But the cookies of the macaron were a touch underdone the last I had them here (which was quite a while ago). Wouldn't hesitate to get some here if I were in the mood though.  Service has always been warm and friendly here, sometimes even charming. For a french patisserie, it really is as good as it gets! Easy 5 stars.",

I wish I had brushed up on my French and maybe brought along a dictionary of pastry terms. After reading all of the cards, I realized, how can I go wrong as long as it looks like chocolate and doesn't have something I don't like as an ingredient.  I finally chose 2. One was a long rectangle covered in glistening chocolate. Inside was a delicate cake surrounded by mousse with just a hint of a crunch. The second was cylinder of chocolate mousse with a Carmel filling. They were Bo the kind of food you ate with very small bites, savoring each morsel and trying to identify all of the shuttle favors and textures.",

My favorite flavor I've had is the special Pittsburgh one (I suspect that it's lemon and chocolate though they're keep it a secret) all the fruit flavors are good as well.

The staff is polite, efficient, and helpful, the decoration is gourmet, the kitchen staff is visible, and the patisseries and macarons are the best we've ever had.  They also do a croissant (sold out when we went) and a simple baguette which was also the best baguette ever!  It is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  It compliments other businesses on the street.  This Saturday, we stopped first for a baguette and macarons, my wife got Tea from Margret's Tea, Pikolino shoes from Littles, John Varvatos shirt from Charles Spiegel, a Mayoral outift and Djeco puzzle from Kidz and Company, and some new Wusthof knives from Contemporary Concepts.  Gaby et Jules completed our faux vacation to Squirrel Hill, which felt like a trip to Europe!  Make sure to try the Basil Chocolate Macaron, sounds odd, but tastes AMAZING!",

Some of the more interesting flavors include Pittsburgh (baileys), Earl Grey, Rose, Nutella, and white chocolate basil. They also have a plethora of other, more common flavors like chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, lemon, pistachio, and raspberry.  I've never been disappointed by a pastry here and would definitely say this is my sweet shop of choice. I wish the prices were a tiny bit lower, but the quality is worth the splurge (and check out their occasional macaron deals).",

There are a couple tables for seating and the a large glass display full of the most beautiful desserts ever. They are literal works of art. There is also a huge variety of macarons for sale, the one we chose was of course Le Pittsburgh, which was Baileys Irish cream flavored!   The girl working the counter was so sweet, when she realized I was mesmerized by everything she helped me decide what to order. Going over the ins and outs of each dessert and whether or not to choose a chocolate item or a fruit item.   Needless to say I went with one of each lol, and my husband chose the Lemon Tart(he loves lemon). I tried all 3 when I got home tjat evening. The lemon tart was indeed good, but I felt the crust could have been a bit thinner and it was packed too tightly which made it a bit dense and tough to get through. The chocolate choice I made, Le Royal, was indeed rich. Perfect for a chocolate lover, would have enjoyed more of the crunch in it to help break up the richness. The Bavarois was my favorite bite of the day. I I loved it. A nice sponge topped with an amazing custard that was fruit flavored and a BlackBerry gelee and puree. Topped with a cute, little pretzel shaped marshmallow. If I'm in the area again I will definitely stop back in to try something else.",

    "text": "I stopped in here after a trip to Sq hill to pick up a few things just looking for a small dessert. On walking in I was greeted (that's always a plus to me) this place is pretty tiny and doesn't feel very welcoming as a sit down place. I'm not a big fan of macaroons but they did offer a lot of other stuff to suit whatever it is you may be looking for. This place is definitely a bit high for a small dessert but the presentation looks nice as it sits on the shelf. I settled on a slice of the tiramisu-Ish  lopera cake. Now the thing that was most upsetting to me is the lady asked if I wanted it for here or to go and I said for here and it seems they use the same package regardless if how you want it. You would think with wanting to sit down and eat something they would use a plate instead of a flimsy cardboard box and save on paper products. It was awkward sitting down and opening it up to eat off it as a plate with a plastic spoon but it is what it is. The flavor profiles where decent it wasn't dry and was nice and moist and dense and I like that, the chocolate it's self in the cake didn't taste fake or cheap like a lot of places do and actually had a rich taste to it and not bitter. It wasn't anything to rant about or really stand out tho over any other pastry shop. Overall I doubt I'll be returning here again because it's something I can do without.",

The cookies are dry-crumbly (not dry-flaky) with moist (almost-too-sweet) creams in the center. They are beautiful to look at and have enticing flavors, but honestly I would choose my friend Gabby's iced orange cookies over these. We will stick to the fancier desserts for special occasions and skip the macarons.",

They have such a wonderful selection of finely made macarons - there really is something for every taste here. Once you've tried them all, make sure you don't forget about their other French desserts. The mille feulles looked amazing - will definitely be picking some up next time we are around the corner.  I especially enjoyed the professionalism of the staff; they clearly take great pride in their work, and take their time to show you the different options for your selection. You most definitely get what you pay for - exceptional skill and amazing, delicious flavor. We shall definitely be back! (Soon!)",

From their sleek store exterior, to the great windows displays to their bright open interior the whole place feels fresh, clean and new. The same can be said for their many desserts.   The first thing you'll notice is that all of the desserts LOOK amazing. Half of the display case is a rainbow of macarons of every flavor you could imagine, while the other half if full of gorgeous patisseries.   But how does everything taste? My son calls Gaby Et Jules \"The Delicious Cookie Store\" and the name is appropriate. My favorite macarons are the almond, chocolate and lime (which is really refreshing). In terms of patisserie I enjoy the Opera and the Meteor - both filling and beautiful to look at.   Gaby Et Jules is not cheap, but its craftsmanship and quality make it worth it.",

I very much enjoyed it, but be warned it was very sweet  They also had free samples at the counter of one of their cheesecakes! The only downside is that macarons are so expensive. At $2+, definitely more of a rare treat than a regular spot  (by the way, my friend loved the gift!)",

Gaby Et Jules has a lot of pretty pastries but we were there to buy macarons. We got the lavender cassis, peach violet, mango saffron, white chocolate basil, and le pittsburgh. The mango was our least favorite (which was disappointing; we love mango!). There just wasn't any detectable mango nor saffron flavor. The white chocolate basil was our favorite- beautiful basil flavor! We really enjoyed the other flavors also- we've had macarons from a lot of places and we loved how the macarons here (minus the mango one) had so much flavor infused in them. We loved them so much we went back the next day to buy more for our trip back home haha.",

    "text": "Gaby Ate Jules was the title of a movie I once saw on the internet. I can't give you the link because children may be watching. However, this is not that.  It's a really lovely little clean shiny modern French bakery full of treats, with absolutely lovely service from girls that are genuinely obsessed with their own products and excited about them. The Macarons were good, and probably would have earned 5 stars if they were normally priced, but at $3 a pop, I couldn't possibly give them higher than a 4. I've had much better incarnations of them which are invariably cheaper. Not to mention that Pittsburgh is a cheap-to-mid-price city, and even New York City bakeries (except some of the more posh ones) don't charge this much for a single Macaron.  Still, the products score 5 despite the high prices. Now would you like to see my family Jules.",

Everything is laid out in an organized manner and perfectly labeled with names, descriptions and prices. I have tasted the macaroons from here before. They were good but I don't totally obsess over macaroons so I didn't realize this bakery's full potential.  I was torn between the death by chocolate log (not its real name) and the raspberry mound (also not its real name) and decided on the chocolate log after a long mental battle. I couldn't wait til I got it home so I ate it outside. And... omg!!!!!!!  It was a creamy and fluffy mousse with parts that were crunchy and other parts that seemed to be like chocolate gel. Every bite was perfect and I felt like I was on vacation. The dessert looked perfect and even had a little piece of gold on top. Also the super shiny chocolate frosting(?) made it look super sleek. It was a sexy dessert.  I will now begin to fantasize about every dessert I saw on display today and what they taste like until I return to try them all. My only issue was the prices of some of the items. (Macaroons I'm looking at YOU)",

I sampled the almond, coffee, raspberry, salted caramel, lavender, white chocolate basil, and poppy. I didn't really care for the white chocolate basil...the basil reminded me too much of Italian seasoning. The almond was delicious. The cookie shell was speckled with yummy almond pieces. My absolute favorite was the poppy, which is the April flavor of the month. It had a strong berry taste and I wish I had purchased more than one. The only downside here is the price, which is expected for macarons. $15 for 7 cookies makes them more of an occasional splurge than a regular treat, but maybe that's the way it should be!",

The macarons were fine - a little too sweet for my tastes, though - and at $2.00+ per macaron it really wasn't worth it.  The quality of each macaron half (i.e. without the filling) was the same as the macaroons that can be purchased at Moio's in Monroeville - at a much lower price.  The quality of the macarons at Gaby et Jules just didn't justify the high price - it just didn't - regardless of how much high-end packaging the pastries were wrapped in.

While waiting in line, you can watch the pastry chefs at work in the back, and its a truly unique experience.  The sample of the day was the pecan pie macaron and it did not disappoint. The other pastries are so perfect and beautiful they almost look fake.  True works of art and delicious.  The desserts here taste regal, not heavy. After trying to narrow down my selection, I chose the Creamy Pear Cheesecake it was so very good.  Light, sweet, but not too sweet, and the poached pear inside the gorgeous dome was unique.  If you are like me and need that \"little something sweet\" each day, and you happen to be passing by Gaby Et Jules, it's definitely worth going inside!  The pastries are a little pricey...my pear cheesecake was around $6, but again, the experience of this little shop reminds me that \"you get what you pay for.\"  Grab a pastry or a macaron (or six) and experience a little bit of Paris in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "This place is a little pricey but soooooo worth it!  Before I went to Gaby et Jules, I totally underestimated the power of the macaron.  But that's because I never had the right kind - the kind that you can only get from Gaby et Jules.  I do not claim to be a dessert connoisseur but these macarons are just heavenly.  They are perfectly crisp on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth chewy on the inside, with the perfect ratio of crispy to gooey/chewy.  It is hard to describe but I am trying.  Also, they are not overloaded with sugar but have just the right amount of sweetness to scintillate your taste buds.  Along with whichever flavor you choose, it will be like tasting a slice of heaven in every bite.  If you do not feel this way the first time, it may be because you did not find the right flavor for you.  Or maybe try a second or third one until you find that place inside you that goes, \"omg I can't believe I've ever lived without this dessert\"  My favorite is the champagne flavor which is seasonal.  My favorite staple flavors are pistachio and champagne.  Other than the macarons, their pastries and other desserts are also very good.  I have only tried a couple of them so I cannot speak on them, but I think the real star of the show are the macarons here which are unparalleled in their perfection. I cannot pass by this store when I'm out on Forbes without stopping by to grab a couple of them. They are also great as gifts and come packaged in cute red boxes if you buy a half dozen or a dozen!",

The interior was very bright, white, and sparkly clean, which enabled you to really center your attention to their macaron case and their other many intricate desserts. The flavors that I went with were vanilla bean & basil, pistachio, salted caramel, lavender, rose petal, and a chocolate. I ate them over a span of a few days, which all remained fresh even through the drive back home, and each flavor was amazing. Their filling is much more creamy and more whipped then other macarons I've tried, but I loved it! The most interesting flavor was the vanilla bean & basil.. I am a huge fan of basil, and although the basil was a little strong at first taste, it all pulled together really well with the sweetness of the vanilla. I would highly suggest coming here if you haven't done so yet because they are absolutely delicious!",

The dough is shipped from France and baked in the shop. They always have new and interesting flavors!  The macarons and bread get five stars from me no doubt about it!   The reason this review lacks the fifth star is because I am constantly frustrated when I want to buy many macarons and pay pretty much full price for even buying them in bulk. I think it would be totally awesome if they would offer a discount for buying in greater quantities! $2.25 per macaron is not bad, but the size of French macarons is not exactly satisfying! Any time I go I basically want to eat 15 of them and definitely not share.   Overall, this place is awesome! Love it!",

The staff is friendly and patient as folks decide on which treat to select.  I tried a canele the first time I visited and it just might be my new favorite treat.  Eventually I'm sure I'll try something else but for now the canele & macaron are enough of a reason to make a special trip :)",

From an atmosphere perspective... although the owner and staff were extremely happy to serve us... the whole white glove affair just seemed a little stuffy.  I decided to splurge and get a few different types of macaroons and a pastry.  Ignoring the sticker shock I endured (almost $3 per macaroon... really?), I was incredibly underwhelmed by quality, complexity and ingenuity of the options.  Do yourself a favor and grab some macaroons from a non-traditional spot (such as Marty's Market, or if you have the privvy...  simplified versions at the Duquesne Club) as these babies just aren't up to par.",

Out of those, I enjoyed the Pistachio and Earl Grey the most.    I've had macroons from Laduree and I can't even compare the two - Laduree is on a completely other (heavenly) level from most of the macroons I've ever tasted.  The ones from Gaby Et Jules were ok, a bit too creamy in the middle for my taste and I didn't always feel that the flavors were True to taste.  For example, I've had amazingly good Rose macaroons before but if I hadn't rememberd I ordered a Rose macroon I would have never guessed that the flavor was Rose.  Same with many of the other flavors including Lavender and Violet.    I wasn't a huge fan of the White Chocolate Basil but I thought the Pistachio and Earl Grey were 4 star worthy.  6 macrooons will set you back $13.00 - which is on par with other high end pastry places.",

My wife and I lived for a couple of years in France and frequented local neighborhood/village stores for bread and tasty pastry treats. This place is exactly what you'd expect to find tucked away on a chic little side street in Paris or on the fancy main street of the nicer villages and towns of France.  Gaby et Jules has perfectly replicated the in-store experience and, most importantly, the taste and quality of the products. We tried a baguette (which was about half-eaten by the time we had walked the 10-minute walk home!), croissant, and a pastry called Paris-Brest (a circular choux pastry, sort of in the shape of a donut, with hazelnut cream sandwiched in between). Everything was delicious and authentic.  The service was good. Efficiency is what you want in a busy store like this, and the staff moved things along quickly, even though other customers seemed to have many questions that needed to be answered.  Perhaps the coolest part of the experience is looking through the large glass panels to the kitchen where the head pastry chef (a French guy who has worked at some of the best patisserie in Paris) and his team are hard at work.   This is a great addition to Squirrel Hill. The best part is that it isn't an American bakery pretending to be French with substandard products. This is the real deal. Think what you will of the French and their often peculiar ways, but they do know how to make a great baguette (and macaron, croissant, etc, etc). Having something like this in Pittsburgh is great to see. Merci beaucoup Lori et Frederic",

Maybe others can give a more legit verdict but I'm not too crazy about them personally, at least not willing to pay for it at this price.  Lower prices would do this place wonders.

My hubby had a L'Opera pastry which was a perfect dessert that blended coffee buttercream and chocolate.  I had a seasonal dessert with berries, gel, a half of a macaron shell, and macaron filling-it was one of the best things that I've ever eaten!

    "text": "The first time I had macarons was at Laduree in New York. I didn't know what to expect. Here in my hand was a beautiful cookie that I could eat in two bites, and I paid 2.50 for it. Five bites later, I was amazed. It had a crisp and fragile outer shell. Then soft and chewy with some kind of filling. I was surprised more by the texture than the taste. Since then, I have eaten macarons as often as possible.   So what I'm getting to is that Gaby Et Jules makes the most fantabulous macarons I have tried yet. I got Rose, Pistachio, Peach Violet, Lemon, Lavender and Earl Grey. The Peach Violet was my favorite. They were bursting with flavor, and yet not too sweet. And this is coming from a person who can hardly eat anything with sugar in it without calling it too sweet. And they Nailed the texture. It was perfect. Pro tip: (I'm not a macaron eating pro, I just like to act like I am.) To get the right texture, eat 'em chilled. We got our box of 6, and then walked around in the smoldering remains of Squirrel Hill for only a brief moment before trying them. Still delightful but slightly soggy. The rest were consumed after being in an air conditioned car for awhile. That's when they were perfect.   There were other pastries sitting on the marble countertops. At least I think they were pastries. They looked like they were made of ceramic, or plastic, or Crisco. Looked like some kind of art display. So I was afraid to eat any of those because you know what they say, \"You are what you eat.\" (Don't they say that?) I was afraid if I ate one of those, some art shaped cocoon would suddenly be spun about me and I would be whisked away and hung on a wall. I actually wanted to eat everything. Ya, I think I should go back and eat some of those other pastries.",

Their pastries are always so beautiful and tasty.",

    "text": "When I stepped into the store, I was pretty excited because the desserts looked amazing. However, in a city where competition of baked goods is pretty hardcore, I felt that Gaby Et Jules under-performed. Not to mention, it was expensive.  Macarons: My opinion of a good macaron, although may well be misplaced, is good texture and pronounced, vibrant flavors. While they had good texture, I felt the flavor was pretty bland. I enjoy floral flavors and hoped to smell and taste the rose, earl grey, etc. Instead, I felt like I just had a plain, sweet macaron with maybe an afterthought of flavor. If I have to sit in my seat, squinting my already tiny eyes, focusing on the flavor, that's not a good macaron in my opinion. Nonetheless, they were okay macarons and if it were just for these, the place would've gotten a 3 stars.  French Baguette: I was extremely unimpressed with the baguette. While my girlfriend and I were getting the macarons for our expensive study break, the person working there spoke on about how they imported the flour from France and so on. In all honesty, they were kinda pushy with trying to get you to buy more than what you intend to buy. Anywho, I caved in because... bread... those seductive carbs.  Begin my rant here: doesn't matter what country your flour is from, it's not like American flour is inferior. \"Yay! Let's all hate on American stuff\" - every hipster ever. It's about the protein content, how well it's processed, and baking techniques (requiring experience and patience). TONS of bakeries in Pittsburgh use \"American flour\" and make amazing bread. Please don't use \"we use French flour\" as a selling point if the technique and final product is extremely tough, tears at the roof of your mouth, and interior is deflated and dry. End rant.  Overall, lesson learned. I went here because it was close to where I was working and hours were open late. Next time, I will plan ahead and drive to my favorite bakeries further out.",

    "text": "If you want to impress the heck out of people next time you get invited to dinner, bring a box of  little Gaby et Jules pastries for dessert.  Every time the box gets opened, people stand around and go, \"Ooh! Pretty!\"   They are simply the most beautiful-looking and artful pastries in town (the Yelp photos say it all), and they're obviously delicious to boot.  I mean, plan on paying at least $5 a piece, but it's well worth it.     The citrus-y desserts (my personal favorite type on the planet; who needs chocolate?) were fantastic-- the lemon tartlette and le sensation are the best; not to tart/sour or too sweet.  The L'opera (coffee-flavored French buttercream + almond cake + chocolate ganache) is also quite special.    Macarons-- their specialty item-- are just not my thing, so I can't really comment on those.  Why eat dry cookies and pasty meringue when you can eat a lovely pastry instead?  I just don't get it.  I am biased.  That being said, many of my friends rave about the macarons at Gaby et Jules.",

I love the red and silver exterior, it gives a modern look to the main drag of Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill.  All the white glove wearing 'Gaby Girls and Guys' were very friendly, greeting us with a pleasant 'Bonjour!' and smiling brightly while ringing up our $80 (!$!$!) worth of macarons and a pastry.  The macarons are brightly colored yet subtly flavored. Some flavors are better than others. The sea salt caramel was a little disappointing, but the white chocolate basil, almond, and rose were perfect. And yes, they do tip the scales at $2.25 for 1 with no discounts when you buy more.  You pay for high quality, which is expected. It was good to try once, and perhaps on a very special occasion, but Gaby et Jules is a little too pricey for me to become a regular.",

The shop is lovely with a window into the kitchen so you can see the chefs at work, and the displays of pastries and macaroons are really inviting!  I got a plain croissant and a little chocolate mousse cake. The croissant was nothing special-- good enough, but not any better than anywhere else. The cake however was delicious! Perfectly creamy and not overly sweet. It was just the right size to split between two or even three people if you come with friends.   I'll definitely be back in the future and I look forward to trying out more of their selection. The staff were also friendly and though there were several people in the store, I only had to wait a minute before being helped.",
