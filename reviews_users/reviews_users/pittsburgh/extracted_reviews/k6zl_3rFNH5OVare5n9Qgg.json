    "text": "A very good Jewish deli tucked in and amongst the small factories and warehouses on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret.   There were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben, turkey and Swiss on a bagel to a pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and a turkey and cheese on a bread type that escapes me. Regardless, all the sandwiches were very good to excellent. The meat was lean and adequately piled on. The vegatables on the sandwiches were very fresh. All sandwiches came with a Kosher pickle spear and we opted for bags of Snyder of Hanover chips. I haven't had Snyder chips since I left Pittsburgh eons ago.   The amount of sandwiches offered were many. The staff were efficient and three-rivers friendly.   I failed to realize that they offered Matzo ball soup. I will have to save that for a return trip to PGH. Since the in-laws live here, that's definitely going to happen.",

I grab the same two items every time I go in.  Fresh deli sliced turkey, with just a bit of thousand island (not drenched in it), and a fresh rye bread.  The only thing here that rivals it is the TOMATO BASIL TORTELLINI SOUP.  Paired with a double cheese grilled cheese and you got a winner.  Problem is they only do that soup once a month.  I 've had a few other items on the menu, all pretty good.  Just a solid place to eat lunch.",

You really cannot go wrong with the Smallman Street Deli.  Though around noon it gets pretty packed, you can call your order in ahead to avoid the line.  Whether you desire a Rueben, burger, or homemade soup, you'll leave thinking you were in NYC.  The princing is a tad on the high end for a deli, but everything is cooked to order and fresh.  There are some seats available - outdoor seating in the warmer months too.  If you're in the Strip and want a sandwich, stop by Smallman Street Deli.",

A few times I've walked in around 10:40 and asked for an egg sandwich.  The woman behind the counter gets a really serious look on her face and states they stop serving breakfast at 10:30. Mind you the place is empty. (It gets packed round noonish).    She then slowly turns around and with great flair asks the guy slicing meat if he is okay with cooking an egg.  He is fine with it and doesn't give two sh$ts.  She,however, is a stickler for breakfast rules.  Much respect.  Order your eggs before 10:30.  Lunch options are consistently good albeit a little pricey.",

Based on this and other reviews raving about their reubens, I think this deli truly excels at their corned beef!  I returned to buy roast turkey deli meat and cheese, though, and was quite disappointed.  Their turkey is $8.99/lb and a far cry from being as good as the Boar's Head turkey that Butler St. Deli sells for $7.49/lb.  I was also somewhat disappointed in the quality of the pepperjack cheese I bought there.  The service is also hit-or-miss.  I doubt anyone here is downright rude, but some guys are friendlier than others.  There are some nice tables and chairs to sit down and enjoy your sandwiches/burgers, but only outdoors as far as I can tell.  In conclusion: come for the corned beef, but skip the deli turkey/cheese!",

It was packed, there was hardly any seating and it was very warm in the restaurant. The pastrami on rye sandwiches fell flat for us and were only ok. The meat was bland and there wasn't much of it on the sandwich. All in all, I don't know that I would go back to Smallman's Deli. I'd much rather go to the Strip District and get something closer to what we envisioned!",

First off very limited seating but it wasn't too hard to grab a table. Ordered a Reuben and fries, both were very good. My only thing is that the corned beef on my sandwich was kinda tough to chew. But the sauerkraut and dressing ratio to meat was perfect. The fries! I thought the fries were seriously amazing.   I would absolutely go back and try something else since they passed the Reuben test.",

It was clear that the staff was annoyed, as they wanted to get out early. The guy making our sandwiches sneezed, did not cover his mouth or wash his hands afterward, and the gust went right on our sandwiches that were being made. I faked an emergency phone call, apologized for having to cancel our orders, and have never gone back. Terrible!!! Wish I could give negative stars!!!",

Prices were a little high for me given the experience although I'm sure I payed for freshness. My Burger from the last kitchen of the four, was great. The drinks at the bar were $2 a piece, and the bathroom was clean. I'd go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice with the kids.  Shout out to Garland who took care of me and the fan while I was there. He made my experience wonderful. Great customer service from the whole team.",

    "text": "This restraunt has great fries and sandwiches. However beware of their \"Matzo ball soup.\" Technically it's a soup as it was served in broth. However any Jewish person knows that is not real matzo ball soup. The matzo ball is bland and the soup flavorless. Lacks the parsnip, carrots, and other vegetables that really make the soup explode with that flavor your family makes during the holidays. It really needs to be removed from their menu. If you can't make it right, don't have it. ( I miss Toojays in Florida.) Don't bother calling them it will aggravate you before you step in the door. The man was quick to place you on hold before you speak and I was hung up on three times before they actually spoke to me. Parking was sucky as most of Pennsylvania consists of. So to people from here it's normal.   For people like me most of Pennsylvania needs to be torn down and rebuilt to have places with real parking lots. (No offense meant.) And to combat anyone who does take offense, living here was not by choice. Give me a million dollars and I would be happy to move. A little off topic sorry.  Nice little restraunt which if I want good fries and a ruben I wouldn't mind going again.",

My husband and I enjoyed the environment, and the workers were very nice and offered us a box for our fries when we ordered two smalls without realizing how ginormous the servings are.  I got the grilled chicken, and it was pretty tasty. The provolone and banana peppers on my sandwich were both really fresh and yummy. My husband tried the Reuben per a friend's recommendation and liked it but did say he'd had better Reubens before. Definitely would recommend stopping here for a good sandwich and good fries! Parking wasn't difficult for us despite it being a Saturday, but we also live in Pittsburgh, so we're more accustomed to city parking issues. If you're coming from the suburbs or out of town, don't come on a weekend morning. And if you get the fries, one is enough for 2-4 people.",

Everything about it was perfect, but if anything I wish they would have given me a little less meat.  I think there was 2 lbs of corned beef on this thing.  Basically the reuben is a fat bomb, but soooo worth the splurge once or twice a month.  They have indoor and outdoor seating and this place is a lot more than a lunch spot/sandwich shop, it is very much a full deli.  You can call ahead and order (for example) steaks for dinner, and they'll have them ready for you when you leave.  This is by no means the cheapest lunch spot in the strip dist.  I had a reuben and a side of potato salad and it was about $14.  But the reuben is grilled for you right as you order it.  It was freaking huge, I did not need the potato salad.    The menu is really diverse, there are a lot of soups and salads so I will def be back even on days where I dont feel like going full on fat girl.",
