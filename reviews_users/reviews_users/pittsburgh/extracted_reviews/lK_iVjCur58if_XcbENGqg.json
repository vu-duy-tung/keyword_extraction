We moved in to the neighborhood, and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that, and how it is without a doubt, the best pizza in the Burgh.  So, of course we tried it, and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.  Honestly, it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now, I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas, they aren't but, I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.  Another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it.  .",

Campiti's is a hole-in-the-wall, formica countered, 70's-paneled, Pepsi menu board behind the cash register kind of place. There's not much seating, the t.v. is a tiny tube job from the 80's, and your pie comes on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a paper bag.   And the service? Well, they're efficient. They don't care if you like them, they just want to get you your food, and fast.   But who cares? The reason I make it a personal mission to go to Camps every time I return to Pittsburgh is the pie. It's thin and crisp, yet solid. Nice browning all over. The sauce is a well-seasoned red gravy that provides a tasty base for the copious amounts of mozzarella and whatever other toppings you want. Me, I go for the pepperoni - which is the type that cups up in the oven, forming little pools of fat - and anchovies.   It's spectacular, and reasonably priced. It is, honest-to-god, my favorite pizza place.  Worth the trip to the South Hills, wherever you start in Allegheny County.",

Will I drive twenty minutes to get this pizza again?  No  I have to say this is a no frills pizza shop, and my pizza was ready to go in 10 minutes both of which I appreciate.  The cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and seasoning were delicious.  These three components are of equal quality, and the sauce may be better than the pizza powerhouses around the city (Mineo's, Fiori's, Doughboy's, Vincint's {while Vincent was still around}), but the crust is terrible.  I love the thinness and crunch of the crust, but there is no doughy-ness to it at all.  My ideal crust is thin and rigid, but once the surface is cracked when you fold it it has a little bit of dough in it.  This did not...I wouldn't say it was like a saltine, but I would say it has frozen pizza qualities.  I liked how it was served in a brown bag  (hate dealing with disposing of pizza boxes).  I also think the pizza reheat well which is an underrated, but necessary component to pizzas.",

    "text": "CASH ONLY!  In the Potomac Avenue Pizza Wars, there are but two combatants; Molly's and Campiti's. And they are at a stalemate.  When you get takeout from Campiti's, your pizza will come on a cardboard disc and will be placed in a paper bag. Be mindful of this. Fortunately, the pie survived the short trip home last night, and a crack, tidy pie it was. The crust was thin yet sturdy and gave the teeth a workout at the edges. A \"saltine\" cracker doesn't describe it at all, however.  Nor did the pizza taste like a frozen Geno's abortion. C'mon. Do you people have fun writing these whiny, inaccurate reviews?  The cheese was tangy, slippery like a Steve Vai axe solo, the pepperoni curled into small cups of meaty love, and the sauce acted as a masterly, pungent focal point. Campiti's makes a pizza that is just as excellent as Molly's, but at the same time is greatly dissimilar. Try them both and compare/contrast for yourselves. Hopefully, they'll both be around long enough to develop their own Mineo's/Aiello's-style rivalry.   The hoagie was merely adequate and skimped a bit on the meat.   After finally getting to try Campiti's, I am left with  no regrets. I've been told that Campiti's has a cult surrounding it. Based on the pizza I had, I can clearly see why as each slice inculcated my taste buds like a psychoactive drug administered by a charismatic leader with penchant for soaring rhetoric. Fortunately, I am strong-willed and thus was able to resist falling into...its trance. Is it a magnificent pizza, the best ever made? No. Is it a very good one? Absolutely.   Bring on the mob of cloaked Campiti's disciples and their ceremonial daggers. *snikt* Bub.   P.S. The guy who waited on me was far from a jagoff. I know jagoffs, plenty of 'em. He is not among their ranks.",

It's thin, light, and the sauce is perfect.  My recommendation is to combine it with a half Italian hoagie and you have one heck of a meal!  Salads are simple, but also great.

I, being pregnant and on a pizza craving kick, couldn't get in the car fast enough to hop on over to their Dormont location. We ordered a large pie, half pepperoni and sausage and half with just sausage and cheese.  Oh, and an iced tea and a Pepsi (they have cartons/cans available for purchase). The pie came, and although this could feed a family of 3-4 my husband and I demolished it. Yum! Crispy, thin crust and my sausage and pepperoni half was amazing. The ground sausage is just slightly spicy and oh so delicious. There is a small dining room with a tv and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our pizza. I'll be back for sure!",

My theory is that the people who love it grew up on it, so maybe it's a nostalgia thing? I only had it once tho so maybe it was just an off night.... or the recipe has changed? But I'll give it another chance.",

But the sauce is great and so is the cheese.   Hoagies are awesome too.  I like the steak which comes with Italian dressing. The Italian hoagie is pretty good too, but I prefer the steak.   This is a take out pizza place. Don't waste your time dining in and expect to have five star waiters and service. This isn't the place for that.",

Ordered a cheese, and sausage pizza over the weekend to have while the Steelers stunk against the Eagles. The husband ordered an Italian hoagie as well, and went to pick up the order. The pizza comes on a nice, not doughy crust, nicely crispy. The cheese and sauce were evenly distributed, and the sausage pizza was definitely a great tasting pizza. As a non pizza fan, I was impressed with Campiti's pizza, I can't say much about the hoagie since I didn't eat that, but it seemed to be just what was wanted, and was eaten without any complaints. Will definitely order again, even if we have to order wings from another shop.",

Delicious and the pizza was bubbly hot and fresh out of the oven. I didn't mind waiting as the guys behind the counter were friendly, funny and genuinely fun to talk too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the hoagies could use a little more meat on them...but still yummy! Pizza crust is perfect...not too thin, not to thick and crunchy.

The crust is a medium thickness, not to thin and not to thick, and somewhat crunchy.  One friend calls it almost like a biscuit, I really don't get that, but it is a little chewy and just a little brown around the edge.  One thing that I notice is they do not overload the pizza with sauce and toppings like some places.  Enjoyed our pizza and will be back.

    "text": "I can definitely appreciate a local spot that does extremely well. That is the reason I decided to check them out. However, their pizza crust is very crunchy and I myself like soft/chewy crust. The only thing I very much enjoyed on the pizza was the excellent crumbled sausage topping. The Italian hoagie was also very good.   I would be back for the hoagie, but not so much for pizza!",

    "text": "This place does not accomodate people with food allergies.  I am highly allergic to iceberg lettuce and made that clear upon ordering. Long story short , after i stated that i do NOT want iceberg lettuce on my hoagie they not only put it on anyhow but eventually refused to give me my money back. I have not gone back and refuse to go there ever again.",

I was very pleased with the pizza very good I haven't had a thin crust like that in a long time. Awesome toppings, they have those cool little pepperonis . Quick service. My only quarrel is weak menu, i guess keeping it simple, makes it easy. I'll update you when I try the one in Bethel Park! BONUS:They have cans of Cherokee Red how cool is that?",

    "text": "Pizza is very basic and has no flavor! The crust tastes like flour mixed with water. The sauce was decent, but I would rather eat a frozen Tostino's pizza. We ate it the shop and the staff were really nice and the place is clean.",
