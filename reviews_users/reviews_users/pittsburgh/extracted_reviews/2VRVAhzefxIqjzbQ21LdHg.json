    "text": "The Foundry is an excellent little lunch place on the North Shore. I stopped in with 3 co-workers for lunch on a dead-as-disco Friday afternoon. There was no games and the state of the dining room reflected that, with only a few occupied tables. The waitress brought us waters, and then proceeded to disappear for quite a while. This would become an unfortunate trend. Once we finally ordered, I got the chicken sandwich with fries, my coworkers got the pierogis, pulled pork sandwich and side salads. What followed was a very, very long wait for our food. So much so that we had to flag down the bar tender to ask what the deal was. Someone followed up and told us it would be out in 5 minutes and sure enough, there was the food 5 minutes later. It was, however for another table. After another round of waiting, our food came out with an apology that they \"are still getting their food times right.\"   Here is the catch, the food was ABSOLUTELY fantastic. The chicken sandwich, while a little messy, was the perfect blend of flavors. The pickles, dressing and breading all positively sung in harmony with the chicken and the bun. The perogis received very favorable reviews as well, and the pulled pork was an uncontested hit. The best thing on the table, however, were the frites. Crispy on the outside, warm and perfect inside, these taters were the stars of the show. They're lightly salted and seasoned and oh so damn good. I shared my order with the table and we all agreed they were top notch.  The waitstaff brought us our checks quickly thereafter. It's also worth mentioning that the prices here are very reasonable, especially when stacked up against Asiagos and Bar Louie, where dollar amount doesn't necessarily equal quality.   I highly recommend The Foundry. Once they get their kitchen sorted, this will be one of the best places on the North Shore to eat.",

    "text": "I found the Foundry on yelp. I was looking for a place that was different yet still had some items that a picky eater could enjoy. First off, I love that it was located in the North Shore, the atmosphere down there is always nice especially with the other new restaurants that have been added down there. Now, getting to the restaurant...The foundry had an industrial feel. It was spacious, when we went it wasn't super busy at all..however, if it was busier, you wouldn't feel crowded with other guests around you. The service was pretty good and the servers and other employers there were friendly. The menu didn't have a ton of choices to choose from which was nice because when a menu has too many choices it can be overwhelming. They have a side of mac and cheese which was great. One of my favorite parts of my meal. We also got pierogies as a starter which were incredible. This is a place everyone needs to try if you're looking for a different place to eat and not just a chain!",

The atmosphere was great too. We ordered the pork belly bites which were pretty bland in my opinion. The texture was good and they had spice from the jalapenos but heat doesn't always equal flavor. Maybe a touch of salt? Anyway I ordered the grilled cheese and fries and it was amazing! Cheesy from the cheddar, creamy from the boursin, and cooked to perfection. We probably would have stayed longer for a few drinks but like I said, it wasn't too lively for a Friday night. Great place overall!",

    "text": "Figured I would try out this new restaurant on the North Shore. We got the olives for appetizer which consisted of just a bowl of olives (no bread or anything to go with it). I got the steak frites which was just a small 6-8oz steak with french fries (no other sides). I was really disappointed with the amount of food I got for a $24 dish. The steak was okay at best. A little overcooked but the biggest turn off was the overpowering liquid smoke flavoring that was added to the steak.   It seemed like the restaurant was very understaffed with the waitress being forced to make our drinks instead of the bartender. All in all it took about 45 minutes for them to make our food. We did get a dessert for our troubles which was the banana bread dish. The dessert was pretty good but once again, to charge $7 for three small pieces of banana, a few pieces of bread, and dressing is a bit excessive.  Probably won't be coming back unless I'm in the area for a concert or sporting event but in that case I'll probably stick to drinks.",

To our surprise they were serving the Brunch menu as they do every Saturday and Sunday unless there is a game then they serve from the Game day Menu. This was a nice surprise as the Brunch menu had some unique items from which to choose. Really awesome. I had the Toad in the hole, What consists of a grilled cheese sandwich , they cut a hole in the center and fry an egg in there. I have never tasted anything like it. It was very tasty. It came with fries which were also very tasty as they have a unique seasoning on them. My husband ordered the cap't eggs Benedict which was also very tasty. Now if you don't want brunch items, the  menu also included some regular lunch items such as the Foundry Burger, Steak, Salads, Pierogis etc. We only had water to drink however they do have a lot of interesting beers on draft and very unique cocktails. The staff is friendly and courteous. We were seated promptly and our food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. The atmosphere is awesome. Lots of barn wood and metal  makes for a very unique decor. We will definitely go back and recommend it to everyone.",

They have a very nice beer selection as well as lots of cocktails. We order the Charcuterie plate, wings and the pho. Pho was spot on on flavor and nicely presented as a bowl with all the Vietnamese herbs and noodles rather than how it is served a a traditional Vietnamese restaurant.  The wings were very good, crunchy and right amount of heat. The Korean red sauce on them was different enough but not so different that I would still consider them Buffalo type wings. Charcuterie plate was just ok, fairly small and would have like to have a explanation as to what was on the place. It was very busy with little blobs of this and that but with no idea of what anything was. Service was very good and look forward to trying more menu items.",

We were dining with another couple who had picked the place so we could hardly make a scene, but the Flatiron steak was fatty and the pulled pork was dry, cold and overcooked (tasted like leftovers). The fries were salty and the German potato salad was from some other country. In short, if you want to drink this place is OK, but if you want good food then go somewhere else. Since we were the only table dining at the restaurant on this weeknight, it appears that many are doing so.",

My husband got the cod which was tasty but not filling. The only real side to it was bok choy and he only got two small bulbs. The other side it was paired with was segmented, marinated grapefruit. Should have been a garnish but there was enough of it and nothing else that it was a side. I mean this isn't an a la carte establishment. The dish would have had more value for the price if it was paired with something...anything else! Rice, perhaps? I let my husband share my salad and fries as that dish was just not enough for a fairly hungry adult male. I'd like to say I'd be back but now just not sure if we can trust the other entrees...in that they will be just as small with odd pairings. We'll see how the restaurant progresses...as North Side dwellers we are in dire need of a decent yet affordable restaurant in this area.",

Perhaps this restaurant excels when then are very busy.

    "text": "Okay. Stick with me.... Upon entrance, nobody greeted us. Even when someone did come to seat the two people in front of us, they did not acknowledge us, no \"hello we will be right with you\".  We waited in the entryway for at least 10 minutes. Bartender even walked by and did not say hello. Finally hostess sat us. We went to the back of the Restaurant.... It's overlooking the river. There's a very huge bar and it is a very huge establishment. It also has outdoor seating. Our server greeted us and we ordered the cheese spread with pickled onions, pickled cauliflower and pickles, served with Ritz crackers. Pretty damn tasty. I ordered the short ribs, a huge piece of meat, too much for me to eat, but it is currently all in my belly. My fabulous sexy husband ordered the tagliatelle pasta dish with the sage, walnuts and butternut squash. It was topped with breadcrumbs or Ritz crackers. It was OK, it was way way too salty. For cocktails I had a cahpirhinia, yay! Bartender actually knew how to make one. Sexy Husband had a Brazilian mule, made with Casacha. Server took away our appetizer and I didn't know until I looked for it . But I want you to know the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. We made our way up to the bar to watch the hockey game. I will come back again and can't wait for summer to sit outside and have a delicious cahpirinia and some more food. I love discovering new places in the city. We have only been here for six years and we have found fabulous places to eat... Rock on...",

    "text": "The North Shore has picked up its social scene quite a bit these past few years by adding more and more bars and restaurants. One place I have been itching to try, and haven't, is The Foundry. I've heard great things about it, so I wanted to experience it myself.   I ended up meeting a friend there for some drinks after work. I was pleasantly surprised with the modern/barnyard aesthetic that the place had to offer upon entry. It's very industrial looking and plays towards the \"now\" type of look, which is good in my opinion. The place has two bars and a large dining area. it also has an outdoor patio on the river, which will be ideal for the spring and summer months.   We got to the bar right before happy hour ended at 6pm. I got a beer for around $4. The bar had a $6 happy hour apps menu. However, their apps aren't your typical bar food. They have things like duck-fried nuts and pork belly bites. I opted for their duck confit haluski. Yes, there was duck in it! Tasted just like pulled pork. It was even topped with a fried egg. My buddy got the grilled cheese, which looked amazing. He then ended up getting their mac n' cheese, which I tried a bite of. Pure heaven.   The bartender was super nice and suggested some great drink choices. They had a sweeter strawberry ale, but I thought it was too sweet to drink alone, so the bartender recommended for me to get half of that mixed with half of a hefeweizen-type beer. It was dynamite. I even got the chance to talk with the owner who was super chill. He told me about their Saturday and Sunday brunches that have a bloody mary bar!   I definitely had an enjoyable experience and plan on going back soon whether that's for happy hour, dinner, or brunch. I highly recommend this place.",

We saw 90% of the people who sat down get up and leave due to lack of service.  When someone finally took (and wrote down) our order, they had to come back some time afterwards to ask for it again.  They were out of menu items, and yet still charged for them just because you asked about them.  Even the utensils came out after the food.  At that point, you're so hungry you don't notice the state of the food until you've already eaten some.  And yes, I did feel sick afterwards.    Just don't go.  I don't know how this place is still in business, and hasn't been investigated by the Health Department.",

Front bar is misleading because the back bar is larger and that's really where most of the restaurant is located, along with a larger bar.   I had average service the first time (sitting on back patio), and very poor service second time around. I sat at the bar and it was pretty slow. I had to grab my own silverware. I wasn't offered a second drink and my glass sat there on the bar empty for about a half hour. I finally was able to order a water after I ate.  I normally speak up but when the service is very poor at an establishment I become conflicted about giving the place more of my business.    It was one of those experiences where the bartenders and servers were hanging out and mostly ignoring the patrons.   Overall, good food and bad service kind of even out.  I'd go back but wouldn't recommend it to others.",

    "text": "I found this place on a whim when walking through the North Shore - I was looking for a cool place with outdoor seating and a view of the river. The Foundry checks all of those boxes. The inside decor is very trendy cool with an industrial vibe. There was a bar in the front of the restaurant with some seating, and a huge dining area with a second larger bar in the back. I feel like there might have even been more space than that - it was seriously so big.   The outdoor patio is your standard Pittsburgh patio, but the view of the river is a nice, and their chairs are comfy. They do have umbrellas, but if its too windy they will blow away so they are weather depending.   They have a lot of beer to chose from, and a list of signature cocktails that could satisfy anyone's cravings, and they have a decent wine selection as well but I didn't pay attention to that side of it. I got the whippet mixed drink, and I was so happy with it I got a second one. The food menu was sadly very small, and it was tough to chose something I wanted that wasn't like $30 for lunch. I went with the fried chicken sandwich. I was so happy that I did. I got the jalepeno slaw on the side because I am a sissy when it comes to spice, but it was SO good. It was on a poppy seed bun, which was a nice touch and the side salad I got with it was good too. Just basic greens with some edible flowers. Nothing too crazy.   All in all, this was a 4 star experience - in addition to me thoroughly enjoying my food, the service was great too. I will say, it was a little pricier than I would have expected, but we were close to Heinz Field, Stage AE, PNC park  and near the river so I'm not complaining too much.",

There's an industrial warehouse meets barn look going on and that pleases my Pinterest loving soul. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by my first experience here.   I started off with a Mediterranean Mule ($10). This was made with some delicious fig vodka. The drink was fairly sweet, so it went down easy. Very yummy.   For my meal I chose the Pickle Brined Fried Chicken Sandwich ($13). This was extremely tasty. Subtle pickle flavor and the challah bun rocked my world. I got a side of caramelized brussel sprouts (subbed them in instead of the standard fries) and they were perfect.   My heart really wanted some Mac & Cheese, but they were OUT OF Mac & Cheese! Boo! Hiss! I only got through half of my sandwich so I guess the lack of Mac & Cheese wasn't the end of the world.   Service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy, so I can forgive that.",

I had the beet salad and fries, a friend got the pork belly, and someone else had the Brussels sprouts, which I wish I would have had. SO. GOOD. I will say, not a lot of vegan/veg options, so come ready to try new things. The goat cheese in my salad was he perfect accent and although I didn't try the pork belly, my friend said she enjoyed it but it was a little spicy for her liking. My husband and I each got fries, without realizing they were $4 each...they were good, but I've had large baskets of fries cheaper than that, so I thought it to be a tad expensive.   Service was just ok- a little confusion in the end with checks, and didn't have as many beers as some places nearby,  but it's extremely spacious inside and plenty of TVs to catch a game or just hang with friends. Loved the purse hooks under the bar, and it looked like a divider would be able to close if someone were to schedule a private party off the side room. Something to keep in mind for the future.",

They were clearly really passionate about their jobs, and they made great drinks.  The general manager had spoken about the farm to table concept, and we were very excited to try it. We all ordered a bunch of different plates--we tried the pimento cheese dip, the spring veggie pho, the duck confit haluski egg noodles, the octopus appetizer, and I believe that we ordered the Foundry Burger, as well as the fried chicken sandwich.   Overall, The Foundry was a hit with everyone. The atmosphere is great, and the space is large. The food was not bad--I think that it's a more bit more experimental than most new American restaurants, so some of the dishes can be hit or miss. For example, the pho wasn't my favorite--it tasted more like traditional Asian medicinal broth, but the duck confit haluski was hands down amazing, and I would go back just for that. Everybody else loved everything else they ordered, and the service was great.   We will definitely be back for the duck confit noodles, and to also try some of the cocktails!",

The meat is packed with flavor and he bourbon glaze really gives it that something extra. The grilled cheese is also worth having, with bacon, of course. The Lancaster cheddar really sets it apart and the bread is toasted just enough. The pierogis are also very well done. I had the Yukon potato pierogis that has an excellent mustard creme fraiche and the caramelized onions were also very flavorful. I'm usually not a huge fan of sauerkraut but their crispy sauerkraut was a welcome addition to the already excellent pierogis.",

The wait is about an hour to get a table but if you walk back to the dining room you will find tons of empty tables. Apparently they are not geared up for Pittsburgh events and must not have enough cooks, so they let you just wait. But even when you patiently wait you can't even get a waitress to get you a drink!   When you are finally seated you get to wait for another ten minutes before your waitress arrives and then wait almost an hour after you have ordered for your meal to come!!!  Simply, forget about this place if going to the Steelers game. Horrendous service and you will miss the start of the game even if you are at this restaurant 2.5 to 3 hours before kickoff.   There are just too many other places close by that make a huge effort to seat you and get a quick bite to you in time for you to get to the game. Skip this place permanently.",

    "text": "Quite a lackluster experience that I'll chalk up to growing pains. Hopefully they will get their game together relatively soon.  I came here for dinner with a friend. We sat on the outside patio on a nice October day. The first problem was no hostess being there when we first walked in. So we walked back toward the bar and were confused. At that point, they had us walk all the way back to find a hostess and then walk forward again. I wish they would have been able to seat us instead of going through this dance.  Ordered the pork belly bites for the appetizer. These were alright. Quite dry, despite the nice oil at the bottom and the bits of jalapenos. The appetizer was A-OK. I ordered a burger from my entree with a side of cauliflower bites, while my friend ordered The Grouper.  My burger was fine. It was cooked medium rare, which was awesome, but the amount of meat was underwhelming. The burger was mostly bread. The buns were nice and toasted, but as you bit into the burger: the overwhelming flavor was the bun. Way too much bread and too little beef. The fries were delicious and the cauliflower bites was the highlight of the meal.  My friend ordered the Grouper. He was severely disappointed. I was even disappointed for him. They gave him like a 3oz piece of it. It was so small and the most expensive item on their menu! Such a ridiculously small portion. It was almost insulting. If they are going to serve such small portions, they should definitely either say how many oz's are going to be served on the menu or have the waiter/waitress warn you.  The side salad he asked for never came. He was under the impression it would be a side as the Grouper came on a bed of greens, but didn't really have any sides. When the side salad came, it was a bunch of measly lettuce and a few grape tomatoes with a heaping of dressing. And they charged us $5 for it. Ouch.  The coffee I asked for, the waitress spilt on our table. No big deal at all. However, the coffee was lukewarm. Which was probably a good thing because otherwise there would have been some injuries. The waitress apologized for spilling coffee and overall was pleasant, but never asked us how our meal was. We didn't bother contesting the $5 salad charge because we were in a hurry to get out of there.  Overall, I could see this place being nice once they get the kinks worked out, but my feedback would be:  1) Have a better system in place in case customers miss the hostess, especially with such a large area.  2) Uh, please fix your portion sizes, especially for your higher priced items. You're not a fine dining restaurant that serves 3oz pieces of fish for $26. Makes no sense. Even for your burger, if you're not going to increase the size of the beef -- decrease the size of the buns.  What you're doing right:  1) Burger was cooked medium rare. The beef tasted as it was fresh and high quality. Yay! Fries and cauliflower bites are delicious!  I hope this feedback is helpful. I haven't necessarily crossed this place off my list next time I visit, but I'd definitely be careful about ordering expensive plates of fish if I were you without double checking that they would feed a moderately hungry person.",

    "text": "I may have to give this place a try another time because I did not enjoy the food as much as many other reviewers have. Our waitress was great! She was friendly and personable, she was attentive, and she was quite enthusiastic about several menu items. Perhaps I just took the wrong suggestions from her.    I had the Foundry Burger, which came with the choice of a salad on the side (among other choices). I will say that the ranch dressing on the salad tasted homemade. It was delicious and unlike other \"traditional\" ranch dressings you get when you order a basic side salad at most other places. I ordered my burger medium and it came that way, but something about the mixture of ingredients did not taste great to me. It could have been the mushrooms mixed with the type of cheese, or the caramelized onions mixed with the flavor of the mushrooms.... I ate all of it because i was quite hungry and it wasn't terrible by any means. It just was not something I would order again. All in all, it was an okay dinner experience.",

Came in on a Friday night and it was dead, and it's because it was only 9 days old when we visited, not because it's terrible. Folks, check this place out!  From the outside, it looks like a tiny bar, but there are plenty of tables and another bar in the back. It's actually quite large and spacious, and well-decorated.   The drinks were awesome!! The bartender was awesome!! She created several drinks off the menu that were absolutely perfect. On top of being a great mixologist, she had a great personality and talked to us like we've all been long time friends.   Such a positive experience at the bar that I can't wait to come back to try the food!",

Food: This place has things on their menu varying from peirogis and haluski and pho and ban mi. All of which you can taste how fresh and they source locally! My husband got the ban mi and although there was a ton of pork in it, it was shredded not sliced. My grilled cheese was simple but delicious and not overly filling. The sides of garlic fries were delicious and their side salads include kale and edible flowers making me want to order a whole salad next time!   Drinks: We sat outside, but I want to come back for happy hour just to see at their awesome bar. Their happy hour is 1/2 drafts and is truthfully the only time I would come back considering the beers are pretty steep for Pittsburgh.  Atmosphere: Huge place right on North Shore with a large rustic inside with the a huge wrap around bar with plenty of TVs to watch games. There is ample outdoor seating right on the river walk for a good view and central location!  Value: They have daily specials (find on their website) and a good happy hour. But normally beers run around $8 with average food prices.",

Our dogs had the best time. The cauliflower side... get it. Just don't think. You'll never regret spending $4 on it. I had the burger medium which literally melts in your mouth and my husband had chicken sandwich with the pickles. I don't know the official names of anything but just do as I'm saying. And get the fries. Just get the fries. If you let your dogs eat table food (yolo) let them eat the meat of the burger and the pork belly. Clay (our dog) was literally IN HEAVEN. We were too.  I think that's all. I had 2 don Carlos' and I too, am in heaven.   (Posted on late summer 2016 - 5 stars )   Update ***** Made me sad to update my review on this place. I went on March 19 with my family from Texas, took an eternity to get waited on, the waiter had no knowledge on the beer on taps, on top of the beers being severely picked over. A girl at a table a couple of tables next to us puked all over herself and even then, the wait staff didn't help clean, and her poor friends had to clean it up themselves. The food was still okay, but the portions of the appetizer and quality have definitely declined. My husband wanted to go back and give them another shot but it's hard to spend money on a place which has broken my heart! I feel like a bitter ex girlfriend.",

    "text": "What a great addition to the North Shore restaurant and bar scene!  Located across from Stage AE The Foundry is a beautifully designed and decorated space that is convenient to Heinz Field and PNC Park.    I was here over a holiday weekend mid-day so I will be interested to see the place hopping before a sporting event.  The entrance is unique in that there is a small bar at the entrance of the restaurant.   Have a drink while you wait to be seated and then you'll walk down a long hallway and into the main dining area that holds a huge central bar and abundant dining space.  Additionally they have a huge sliding barn door that opens to extra seating that could also could be used for private events.  There is also ample seating available on the patio overlooking the river.  Beautiful view of downtown!    There is a nice selection of beers on tap and being an IPA lover I was NOT disappointed.  Nice West Coast (Green Flash!) selection and also one of my faves from the mid-west, Goose Island.  There is also a lengthy list of cocktails, and I tasted my sister in law's drink, The Harlow, which was very smooth and sweet.  For an appetizer we shared the duck-fried nuts - which was tasty and plentiful for the three of us.  This is a great accompaniment to your cocktail.  For my main dish I had the pulled pork, which was served on my preferred bun - pretzel, and also had a nice garnish of red cabbage.  Very tasty and a really good sized portion.  Service was friendly and quick.    The food and drinks were great but the real hero here is the space!  The entire place is lined with reclaimed barn wood and large exposed beams with contemporary lighting.  The bar has a concrete top and the ceilings are lined with cool accent tile.  I'll be back soon for a private party and look forward to enjoying the ambiance and the food.",

Everyone at the table was happy with their meal and the cocktails were also very good. I thought it was a little pricey for lunch, but we were in the city.

We were actually greeted at the door when we arrived with a \"thanks for coming in\" and the same when we left. Very pleasant. Quick, attentive. Would have been nice if we were in a hurry.  The food, to me, was just ... meh. I got really excited about the pumpkin pierogies- and they were simply not good. Grilled cheese was better, but it seems like they tried too hard to make it look special and it was just okay. Beer selections are good. If I came back in, I'd get munchies and a beer, dinner somewhere else. It's new. I'll give it a try again sometime once the kinks are worked out.",

We went  the first weekend they were open for my wife's  birthday.  We ordered  2 cocktails which were excellently crafted. The tomato pierogies were unique and light. The small plate duck fried spiced nuts were delicious. We loved the macaroni and cheese with pork BBQ. Hands down the best I have ever had. The BBQ was slightly sweet, which added to the Mac and Cheese. My wife loved the grilled cheese with 3 or 4 cheeses in it. I had the Black Cod. This is just outstanding, prepared with oranges and coconut and tamarind glaze. As good as any high end seafood restaurant preparation, if not better!  I had fresh baked corn that clearly was cut from the cob. Fresh and tasty.  For dessert we had Smores.....kind of a deconstructed version.....phenomenal. I HIGHLY recommend this place for a great meal. I imagine during a sporting event it might be loud, but we were there during a very pleasant early evening.  If they are this good their first week, I can't imagine how they will be in a couple months. Cannot  wait to go back!",

We decided we were going to be adventurous and try some things off the menu. My Caesar salad was great! My friends pickled chicken sandwich was good, her bf ordered a medium burger and it came out well done with a flag on it that said \"medium\" and missing the bacon he ordered. My bf got a grilled cheese that was awful. It was burnt, minimal cheese, covered in butter and burnt bacon. Somewhat disappointed in the food for having such a unique menu. Wouldn't recommend for food, but the decor is beautiful. We only had beer, so I can't comment on cocktails. Hope this helps",

We sat in the inside area although they have a very pleasant outside dining area. The dining room contains more televisions than you could shake a stick at. This is not necessarily a good thing. The chairs at the tables for were little bit uncomfortable. We were welcomed by our server pretty quickly. We started with the pimento cheese appetizer. It is served with pickled vegetables and a few Rittz crackers. Although the dip is served cold, it is served in ac skillet.  The pi- Mento cheese was tasty and the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to that. It was nothing special but it was good. The restaurant bills itself as a farm to table venue. Menu is reasonably diverse. They have risotto and lamb and fish and sandwiches. In that sense, we didn't really give it a fair shake, because we all ordered grilled cheese sandwiches. We had seen reviews that said they were very good. We also got macaroni and cheese and deep fried brussels sprouts. The deep fried brussels sprouts were delicious they were in kind of a hot - Asian inspired sauce and had some peanuts sprinkled over them. The macaroni and cheese was creamy and average.  Some at our table thought it tasted like Kraft macaroni and cheese and for some people that's a really good thing. The french fries that accompanied the grilled cheese were very very good not coated or anything. The grill cheese sandwichesThemselves suffer from a lack of flavor. They are made from Boursin and cheddar cheeses and somehow that does not amount to much in a grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was really good and they were cooked very well. Our server was very attentive. Although it's not a fair sampling of the menu, we all agreed that we would not go out of our way to return.",

Notified the manager at the front Justin Morgan and he just chuckled and stated \"it's after a Steelers game, what do you expect?\" Will never return.",

    "text": "I wanted to give 5 stars but our waitress ruined that... My boyfriend and I stopped here last weekend for lunch but it was during a Pitt game and the brunch menu was so limiting. So we stopped back this past Saturday night for dinner. I absolutely LOVE the decor and everything they've done to the inside - the walls, the lighting, the tables, the ceiling, everything. Our waitress brought us over waters and asked if we wanted anything else to drink but didn't have much time to look at the drink menu so she said she'd come back.... It took her about 10 minutes to come back to us. I asked for a White Lightening and again, she came back in about 10 minutes to say they were out of it and asked if wanted something else. Her excuse for taking so long is that she had a \"large party\" to take care of.... I picked a different beer and she came back much quicker. She offered to take the beer off the bill because it took so long to get... which, we came out to buy dinner and spend money so that wasn't a thought that crossed our minds, we just wanted quicker service at that point. We ordered the pork belly bites - AMAZING. We could have ordered 5 more bowls. Those came out fairly quick as someone from the kitchen brought them to us. I got the BBQ pork mac & cheese - delicious! Just the right amount of everything. My boyfriend ordered the pickle-brined fried chicken - awesome! They are spot on with all of the food. After we were done eating, we sat for what felt like 20 minutes before we had to get up and ask someone else for our check. The manager brought us our check and apologized but gave the excuse they were \"understaffed\". I understand if you don't have enough people working but it should be a priority not to ignore you guests Our waitress didn't even apologize - which isn't a huge deal but come on.... The table of 2 next to us sat after us, got their food before us, and paid/left before us as well.   I would go again but not on a Saturday night.",

Went there for my birthday and the food is fabulous. The decor is open with plenty of tables nicely spaced.  There is outside seating also. But if you're a foodie, you will not be disappointed! My husband and I had the Duck-fried nuts appetizer and the tomato pierogies and  bbq pork Mac n cheese as small plates.  Exceptional flavor!  My husband loved the cod.  Don't scoff but I had the grilled cheese sandwich  -  it melted in my mouth!  The deconstructed Smores dessert is a chocolate lovers delight!  We definitely make this our North Shore favorite!",

    "text": "A welcome addition to the North Shore that is far from the mostly sports bar that are in this area.  We went on a Saturday night before a concert at Stage AE and it was not super crowded so we were seated right away.  They had a great draft list and some awesome cocktails. I was super excited to try the pumpkin sangria and disappointed that they were out.  I then went with the Victory Sour Monkey which is one of my favorite sour beers. The dinner menu was a bit limited but they have some good options of burgers, dinner entrees, apps, and salads.  I went with the burger which came with fresh greens, an orange marmalade, some sort of cheese all on a fresh bun.  I love that you have your choice of fries or a side salad. I went with the fresh greens and picked the blue cheese dressing which was one of the best salad dressing I have had in a while-def. homemade. My friend ordered the wings which are huge and messy! She also got the mac and cheese which is highly recommended. Our waitress was fantastic and even took us an added table when our waitress was busy with a large party.  Another thing I love about this place is the decor which is very rustic and has such a cozy feeling.",

Service was so slow we ended up not making it to our event! We had to flag down the server for any attention and she was next to impossible to find. I don't know where she was hiding. We had the manager come over to answer a question about a promotional deal we got (a free drink/snack coupon from a prior visit that I got due to bad service at that visit) and, while he honored the coupon, he didn't even acknowledge our poor experience. This was the third strike, I won't be going back.",

    "text": "I always like trying new places. I never have off on a Saturday and finally did, so my boyfriend and I wanted to check out all of the new places in the North Shore, this being one of them. It was around 10 o'clock on Saturday when we walked in. There was not too many people there which is fine, we walked right to the bar to grab a beer. They have the beer listed on a chalk board to the left of the bar which is awesome so you can see what you want before even talking to a bartender. Once we both figured out what we wanted we ordered. The bartender did not seem to know what he was doing. My boyfriend ordered a Bell's Two Hearted which he poured. I ordered the 2x IPA from Southern Tier. He looked at me and said he had to go to the back to get it, but then kept staring at me. So I then proceed to tell him I will just have a Two Hearted as well. Without hesitation he poured me a Two Hearted.  1. Do not have a beer list in the front if your bartenders do not want to get the beer for their customers, regardless of the location. 2. We had no idea about the FULL BACK BAR until the bartender in the front bar said so.   Overall it was okay and laid back atmosphere, we will probably not be back. The front bar is totally unnecessary if you have a full back bar that is pretty much hidden. It was just a little weird.  We did not try the food, however, just because of the service unfortunately we will not be back.",

I work nearby on north shore drive, along with hundreds, if not a thousand other people who have no options for coffee and quick bites. All of the venues here, save for maybe burgatory, are geared toward the event crowd.  SAP just announced 242 new jobs coming to North Shore drive. Beat Starbucks to the punch and help us find a reasonably priced meal that doesn't require sit down service, crossing a river, or a delivery from jimmy johns.  Thank you.",

Simple sandwiches and salads and soup with a tasty twist!  We ordered pierogies for a starter -  best ones I have had in Pittsburgh!  Slightly crispy on the outside and soft fluffy potatoes on the inside with a burst of flavor on some bites.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it came with a pickled slaw and was delicious.  Butternut Squash soup for others was a delight on a cold rainy day.  The beer selection was quite good and service was great!  Next time hope to sit outside on the lovely patio!",

    "text": "We came to Foundry's for brunch a couple of Sundays ago.  I made reservations but it wasn't necessary.  The restaurant is very large and can accommodate big groups easily.  This particular day I believe there was a private party in the room next to the bar, as I saw the Steeler's game being projected onto the wall and several people.  We opted to sit at the huge bar in the back.  Note there are two bars.  The inside of the place is very clean, sleek, and modern.  Our bartender/waitress was very pleasant and made us aware of their bloody Mary bar that they offer on the weekends.  The bar had a decent amount of selections to doll up your bevvy, though I missed the additional hot sauce.  After I made my Bloody the bartender walked by with a tray of bacon and offered me my fill since it was supposed to be on the bar.  I don't usually eat bacon, but when I do it's at brunch with a bloody.  Such a nice salty compliment to a spicy acidic drink.  For my meal we opted to share an order of the pumpkin pierogis, and for my entree I chose Cap \"N\" Benedict.  The benny stated it came with hash browns and I inquired if they were deep fried since I don't like deep fried food.  She said they were pan fried which depending can be acceptable.  Upon delivery I felt not only the hash browns were terribly hard and tasteless and added nothing to the dish.  One bite of them and I pushed them to the side.  Not good.  The rest of the dish was pretty tasty but the portion was small for $12.00 especially since the triangle hash browns were terrible.  I was very happy we ordered the pierogis, which were different but good, otherwise I would have still been very hungry.  We spent the better part of the afternoon watching the game and indulging in a few brunch beverages.  Our check was steep, but we did have a good time.  I would like to come back especially since the place is in a great location in regards to the stadiums and it's a nice open clean space.  The food was good, but it could use some tweaking with some ingredients, portions, or price.  Service on the other hand was very good.",

I wanted to try out this place mostly because it looked like a really nice atmosphere to watch some football!       On our brunch dates we usually have no idea if the place is going to be packed or not.  So we made reservations here the day before just to make sure.  Well we didn't need to make them because there was barely anybody here at first.         We walked in and were greeted by the hostess.  There was a small bar to the right of us but I knew that there was more to this restaurant.  I told the hostess that this was the first time that we were here so she directed us to go back to their main bar and dinning area.  After getting through the long hallway we got to the bar and it was a nice layout.  They have a big bar with TV's everywhere, spacious, and very new looking.       We were really hungry so we started looking at the menu. My wife got their Bloody Mary bar to start out.  I started with a beermosa.  We ordered their roasted pumpkin pierogis to start.  They were really good and a good start to our brunch.         I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for brunch but I ended up ordering their Pickle-Brined Fried Chicken.  I usually don't order a fried chicken sandwich like this but I was in the mood for it.  I thought it was ok.  It kind of reminded me of a Chick Fila Sandwich but at a restaurant.  It was ok but I kind of wished I ordered something else.         During the game we switched over to drinking beer for the rest of the Steeler game.  Overall the brunch food was ok and the Pumpkin Pierogis were really good.  Our bartender was great and we did enjoy watching the football game here.  I think we would come back to watch a sporting event here and try out their dinner menu next time.",

The restaurant was almost entirely empty on a Sunday evening, which seemed strange, but I am used to the wildly packed dining establishments of New York; so perhaps my perceptions are a bit off here.  For appetizers, my friend and I shared the popcorn, which I LOVED. Parmesan on popcorn? Yas. While I had skepticism about the cold cheese appetizer, taking the plunge was the right move. My vegetarian entree and side were flavorful but way too salty. The food would have been fine without all of that extra salt. Also, the restaurant seemed weirdly vacant of staff. It felt as though we had arrived right before the restaurant was closing and requested an immense meal...but that wasn't the case. I think this restaurant has potential--the space is so aesthetically appealing to me, both inside and outside--but it needs some tweaks.",

We didn't taste anything on the popcorn except chipotle dust (though the menu ingredients also listed lime, salt, and cotija cheese); the popcorn was very dry and there wasn't much of it! The nut mix had almonds, cashews, peanuts, and a few walnuts, and they just tasted greasy. No flavor at all was distinguishable, not even salt, though again we were supposed to be able to taste thyme, salt, garlic, and chili flakes.   We didn't try any of the entrees as we had eaten earlier in the day but I have to say I am not even eager to try the entrees, unfortunately. Aside from the beautiful rustic decor and very attentive waitress, there wasn't much about this place that got me excited or eager to eat, especially after the disappointing snacks. There were not a ton of people there (even though neighboring places were packed with baseball fans) and a small menu. I think I'll just move on to the long list of other establishments in the area that I haven't yet tried! I had to give a couple stars for the beautiful decor & our waitress was also awesome!",

We were hoping to drink the Space Dust on tap, but it was out when we arrived.   In all, an excellent choice.",

See if you can grab a seat at the bar--otherwise, be prepared to be quoted a wait time of 1 hour before a football game.  They have a pretty decent selection of beers on tap. I tried the Rosemary's Baby Pumpkin Ale. It was pretty good but not great.  We didn't order food but the burgers and brunch food that went by on servers' platters looked really good.  We will definitely go back in a few weeks and order food. And I will remember to get there around 10:30am ish or so to make sure we get a table and have enough time to eat.  Unlike a lot of other places nearby, the Foundry doesn't get as loud as other bars and restaurants which is really nice. If you don't want to order restaurant food, they grill brats and other grab-n-go food items on the patio.  Good call.",

    "text": "Excited to try The Foundry..   Friday night happy hour..  wasnt too crowded but figured the crowd probably ranges with whatever is happening in the north shore. I was glad it wasnt packed. I love the feel of Foundry.. really like the wood and urban feel.  You dont realize how big the establishment is walking in ..  theres a bar in the front area.. very cozy feel but walking down the hall to the back area..  complete dining space with plenty of seating and nice size bar.   Sat a the bar was greeted by the bartender \"Keith\" . .. want to give a shout out for great service and being so great with answering all my questions.    FOOD:  I was surprised at the menu size and selection. I thought there would be a lot more options but not dis-crediting the menu.  Its just more typical to have more options but sometimes \"less is more\".  I had a feeling the prices would be above average and they were.   Roasted pumpkin pierogis:   very different and good. Its not a dish I would get again. The portion is very small.    I loved the grilled cheese.  This was impressive.. the cheese on it really made my taste buds sing.   The fries were good and definitely unforgettable.  There are some unique items on the menu such as a meat and cheese board! I love that.    I really wanted to try the Korean fried wings but wish they weren't the whole wing.To drain i had the the VoodooBrewing - \"GranMet\" - Belgian Tripel -oh it was so tasty.   PARKING: I parked in the lot behind Burgatory and for about three hours it was $7.00 not too bad.    It was a great first experience at The Foundry Table and Tap.  This place is so ideal for a group gathering or happy hour.  I see another visit in the future.",

    "text": "My friend was in town for a conference and was staying down the street at the Hilton. I met her for a late dinner/drinks and we didn't know where to go. As we walked down the street a few of the places called to us but we have already hit them up before and wanted to try out something new, maybe something exciting. The Foundry was where we decided to go. It was pretty empty for the time of night so we got seated outside really fast.   The first bad experience was something that maybe they had no control over but was irritating none the less. We sat outside and when I sat down there was a crack in the table and when the table moved all of the rain water that was just chilling there from the day or day before spilled all over my pants. Ok, not cool, but not terrible. Until it continued to happen every time the table was bumped. My own fault we should have moved but I honestly thought every time that it happened would be the last.   I was hungry and asked the waitress what would be here suggestion. I was between items on the menu and needed her assistance. With her assistance I went with the Bahn Mi sandwich and a side of fries.   ROAST PORK BANH MI: cucumber, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeno, baguette. This is where I went wrong. This sandwich was awful. There were little to no picked veggies,  little to no jalapenos, a ton of cilantro. The bread was WAY to thick and dry for the sandwich and it felt like it was taking all of the moisture out of my mouth. I ripped the bread in half and still felt like choking on it. I ended up just taking the meat off the bun and eating it with no bread. Ugh. The roast pork is not roasted pork as one would think it was pulled pork with a bbq like sweet sauce. Nothing like regular bahn mi's meat is usually made. It was just blah. The fries though were on point. They were garlicky and delish. I enjoyed them a lot. That sandwich though was the worst. Blah, that is a good word to describe it,  I do not know if I would come back just based upon that terrible sandwich. I mean, I always want to give places another shot but that and the fact that my pants were soaked by the end of the dinner just gave me this bad impression.   I wish that I had a better time. The location and the views were beautiful, I just need a good reason to come here.",

    "text": "Went here before a concert on the North Shore. Sat down and had multiple bartenders walk right past us and not ask us if we would like a menu or to get started with a drink. After flagging down a bartender, he gave us menus and took our drink order. It took about 10 minutes for 2 beers to be brought to us. It took another 15 minutes for him to come back to see if we wanted to place a food order. Our food came out pretty quickly and the server attempted to serve it to some ladies with low cut shirts on who were busy taking shots, when they said it wasn't there's he placed the dishes behind the bar. Multiple bartenders reached over and around our food until we again had to flag down our bartender and ask for our food to be delivered. Once delivered, my meal was wrong -- the bartender stated he would correct this and not charge me for this item. The girls next to us had 3 bartenders serving them the entire night and had multiple shots lined up. Maybe it's because they were dressed a tad provocative and the bartenders were all 20s something men. We felt terribly neglected the entire time.   This was after we had a really great first visit. We asked for our check, when he brought us the check he took $3 off of the meal they messed up and I had to question this. He tried to explain he wasn't charging me for the roast beef he failed to add but was still charging me for the entire meal. After voicing my complaints he had the bartender manager come talk to me. He was nice and pretended to listen and was able to compensate me fairly well and take a round of drinks off of the bill. However, he was also one of the bartenders who ignored us our entire visit.   I'm not sure when it became okay to not take care of all of your patrons the same but definitely felt bad leaving the bar. I'm not sure if I will be back which is sad because I appreciate their beer choices",

Everything was so delicious, I would have been happy to keep sampling appetizers. Entree orders varied around the table, with a little bit of everything. I personally had the huevos rancheros, which was among the best I've had since living in the southwest. Our son had chicken fingers and fries but there were a few other options for kids as well - so this is a great brunch option for the whole family.   A few of us did the bloody mary bar, which featured, among other additions, giant perfect slabs of pepper bacon. The other drink options are widely varied, providing something for everyone.  The decor is very clean and contemporary; and, the service was excellent. Add in the location on the North Shore, with plenty of good views and walking paths, and The Foundry is an ideal location for brunch.   We absolutely plan on going back!",

Being our party has disabilities it makes it hard to push towards the bar and fight for a seat. Treat patrons with respect as we were leaving there was an older couple (50s) that were a party of 2 and they got on the list.",

Yes, yes, I was beyond hungry so maybe any food would have been received with total pleasure but I stand by my taste buds and stomach's total satisfaction.  I ordered a burger and fries and, seriously, this was in the top echelon of burgers -- cooked to perfection and moist.  And the fries were seasoned perfectly.  I will say I cannot believe they advertise the burger with American cheese as the only option.  That seems a bit sub-par (more than sup-bar, actually).  I was bold enough to ask for cheddar, thank goodness, so I'd ask you to do the same!  Oh, and I also had a bloody mary.  It was spicy enough to my liking.  The only sad-face part -- no celery available upon my request.  Sigh....  All in all, a nice restaurant/bar, especially if you want to watch a game on TV.  (The Steelers had just finished their game prior to our arrival which was good in a way -- the place was cleared out of patrons so no wait and our choice of tables!)",

I started with the House Ale, which was a pale ale - just what I like! The table shared the pimento cheese dip. I actually liked this a lot. It was served with pickled vegetables and crackers! For my meal, I had the fried chicken breast sandwich. It was huge! But so delicious. The fries that were paired with my sandwich were also really good. I liked my meal and the atmosphere, but the rest of the menu were things I'm not crazy about ordering.",

Last time I was there it was a Thursday evening and the bartender told us that their rock-paper-scissors happy hour, if you won you got a free drink! It definitely added a bit of excitement and engagement with the bartender. At other happy hours we have hosted we order a few appetizers for the tables since we have so many guests. I was disappointed by the food options at The Foundry. They certainly have a creative menu which is great if that's what you are looking for but there weren't any good shareable options that everyone liked. A few examples were marinated olives, pork belly bites, and honey roasted bar nuts which a few people ordered but we were hoping for a more traditional chips and salsa or an appetizer plate featuring a few options which would have been great for a large party such as ours.  The beer selection is great and the restuarant sits right off the river. During the warmer months in Pittsburgh sitting outside and enjoying a cocktail would be beautiful.",

I ordered a bloody mary which I was under the impression would be built at the \"bloody mary bar\" that our waitress had mentioned. The glass was served to me very full so the point of the bloody mary bar was...confusing at best. Plus, of the few scant garnishes that were up there, there were no skewers or a small plate or even a dang napkin to put any of the garnishes on. The bloody mary had more horseradish than I would put in an entire pitcher. It was CHUNKY and nearly impossible to choke down. Service was average at best. I was just visiting Pitts so I won't be back regardless but I'd probably would patronize other places if I were a local.",

This was my first time here (actually I didn't even know this place existed before seeing the promo), and I really enjoyed the space, the drink list, and the food.  My server was very friendly, and she made some recommendations, and I ended up pairing the Sauteed trout w/cukes, potatoes, dill, and mustard seeds with a Rusty Rail Cucumber Ale, and they couldn't have complimented each other any better.  The food and drink were awesome, albeit kind of small portions on the cukes and potatoes, so I was still hungry after eating it, and then had a most wonderful dessert of Pannacotta, and it was fabulous.  Since this is a farm-to-table restaurant, the prices were a little higher than some other places in the area, but not too extravagant.  My meal with tip (including the free beer) was $40, so not outrageous.   The space itself is really nice, and felt comfortable and casual.  I'd recommend this spot, and hope to come back again some time when I am over on the North Shore . . . Cheers!",

The events took way longer than necessary due to the staff replacing food, refilling drinks, etc. I HIGHLY recommend against this restaurant as a venue for a private party.

I can't remember their \"name\" for it, though...but they were both EXCELLENT.  We went during Happy Hour, so their signature drinks were only $5 each.  I thought this was a pretty good deal.    For the delicious food, we had the Sirloin steak that was paired with swiss chard, local mushrooms and roasted potatoes.  I felt the steak dish was a little pricey for the portion and what you got, however, it was better quality ingredients, which you obviously need to pay for.  We also tried the grilled cheese sandwich (which was one of the best i've had).  The grilled cheese had a mixture of cheddar and monterey jack, and a delightful layer of locally made apple butter!  I was shocked at how good this was.  This came with some pretty awesome fries, too.  All in all, I would go back in an instant.  It was a great atmosphere, and the food and drinks were very good.",

We were greeted and seated right away. We were there early before the game so there wasn't many people in the restaurant yet. It's very spacious inside and has space to sit and eat in the front of the restaurant and in the back of the restaurant. A very large party of 15 very loud and very drunk men were seated beside us a few minutes after being sat. I mean there's a whole restaurant with lots of space and MANY tables available. So that was irritating to us since we could barely hear each other talks.  Our service was OK. Our server was very blah and a tad rude - she seemed bothered by customers and gave the vibe that she didn't really want to be there.  As far as food goes, I ordered the haluski, brussel sprouts, and pierogies. My fiance is not from Pittsburgh so I wanted him to try pierogies and I will say that I was pleased. The brussel sprouts were delicious. I liked the haluski, but wasn't the biggest fan of the flavor that the duck confit gave it. That's just my personal opinion. My dad however liked it. My fiance and I were not pleased with the Mac n cheese. It was dry and cheese was sprinkled on top. It wasn't even mixed in or anything. It's like they put noodles in a pan and sprinkled cheese on top and called it mac n cheese.",

    "text": "Review for happy hour only.  I came here with a large group for a week day happy hour. I immediately noticed the great interior and large space. There was plenty of space to sit or stand inside with the optional outside area as well. It over looks part of the city and the river. It is close (easily walkable) to Heinz Field, Stage AE, and many other restaurants and bars. They have a side room that is pretty large and looks like they reserve it for large parties and events.    During happy hour the cocktails were discounted (can't remember if it was half off or they were all $5) which I thought was a fair price and good deal. I will say that the cocktail that the waitress strongly suggested did not taste particularly good, but they had a large amount of options to choose from. She really emphasized the fresh muddled blueberries so I was envisioning something fresh and light, instead it tasted a little artificial. It might have just not been my style of drink. I would like to return to try their food and other drinks that they have.",

    "text": "Not much to complain about for a nice brunch place.  * Food: We came here on a Sunday afternoon and surprisingly, there wasn't many people (probably due to Pittsburgh weather). I couldn't resist ordering the Huevos Rancheros as our waitress said it was a restaurant favorite and it had fried eggs. I'm not a huge fan of potatoes because it's usually not seasoned well but theirs was delicious. It also had pulled pork which was just a tiny bit salty but nonetheless pretty good.       * Cost vs. Worth: Their brunch menu is about $11-$14 with the highest being $24 (steak). That range is about average for a nice brunch dish.   Will I come here again? - Yes. The brunch menu was small but I would come here again to try the main entrees!",

It's a casual and modern atmosphere that you feel comfortable hanging out in with friends. We ordered the poutine to share. Every day they have a different type, but they had buffalo chicken when we were there. It was pretty good. The fries were a bit overdone, but there was plenty of cheese and chicken on top to cover every bite. If there are more than 3 people in your group, I recommend getting a few appetizers to share, portions are small.",

    "text": "I met my family here for dinner on a Wednesday evening after they were at the Carnegie Science Center.  We weren't sure where to eat because we had 2 kids in our party and didn't know if this establishment would be kid-friendly.  We decided to try it anyhow and they do offer a kid's menu.  The restaurant wasn't very busy and I believe this made our experience so much better.  I read some of the other reviews and it seemed that patrons visited during the game and were disappointed because the service was slow.    My family & relatives arrived at the restaurant before me and said they were greeted and seated promptly. They ordered appetizers until I arrived, which were  the General Tso's Cauliflower appetizer and my son asked if they had any breadsticks appetizers, the server Codie stated that they did not.  However; when he delivered the Cauliflower appetizer they also brought out some sort of cheesy bread bites for the kids at no charge.  The boys were so excited and happy, my family was really impressed, and they said they were delicious.    When I finally arrived I was greeted immediately by Codie, who was very attentive, smiled often, and was really friendly during our entire dining experience.  He explained that happy hour was almost over and gave me the rundown of all of the happy hour specials.  I decided on a cocktail (I can't remember the name) which was only $5 and I ordered another appetizer- the Poutine of the day, which was pulled pork.  We all thought it was really good.  The fries were really crunchy and the pulled pork and cheese put the dish over the top.   For dinner I selected the Grilled Cheese, Side of Tomato Bisque, and a small side salad with the house dressing.  I really enjoyed the grilled cheese dipped in the bisque, the flavors really complimented one another.  I did not like the bisque on it's own as it was on the sweeter side, but it made a great \"dip\" for the grilled cheese.  The house dressing was good, but thicker than I expected.    My sister-in-law ordered the beet salad and she loved it.  My brother-in-law had a side of the fried Brussel sprouts and said they were some of the best he's ever eaten.  My relatives currently live in Georgia and said it was one of the best meals they've had in a long time. They were also really excited about the locally sourced ingredients, too.   The combination of the service, quality, taste of the food, and the decor has earned this 5 star review.  We all agreed that we can't wait to go back. If you visit, ask to sit in Codie's section.  He was fantastic and you won't be disappointed.",

It's also very spacious; a good place for groups to get together. Also the music is REALLY low so it's not too loud; might be a nice place for a date or just dinner so you can actually chat with your partner and hear them.   Our waitress was extremely friendly which I appreciated and quick. I got the spicy mule (pretty standard, I wasn't blown away but it was refreshing with the spicy kick I was expecting based off of the ingredients), my mother in law asked for \"half cranberry, half ginger ale with a lime\"...the presentation of this mocktail was cute, even though they put a lemon instead of the lime she asked for.  We got the Yukon potato pierogis as appetizers...not gonna lie,  these were pretty bland...so was my medium well burger. I did enjoy my fries though. My mother in law said her grilled cheese was just ok (I think it's pretty difficult to mess up grilled cheese though) but her Brussels sprouts were absolutely too salty. We couldn't eat them at all, had to switch them out for a salad (with beer vinaigrette on the side). I'm wondering if the saltiness was a fluke.   By the time we had finished, we were so underwhelmed with how blah the meal was that my mother in law didn't even want to give the dessert menu a try. I honestly was just too full. She says she absolutely will not be back but I think maybe if I'm back in town again I might give them another try....not at the top of my list though.",

It does all of this and it does it well.  The front waiting room was a little bare, so I was worried I was in the wrong place, but thankfully a host found me and led me to the back, which is where all the magic happens.  I sat at the bar, which was fully stocked with quality libations. In addition, the beer list was fairly expansive and included a nice variety of styles from both regional and national craft breweries. I visited during happy hour so all draft beers were half off which was a nice perk.  Foodwise, there are plenty of options and they're quite filling. The menu is straight forward with normal American dishes including apps, sandwiches and some main courses. The bartender recommended the pierogis, which are a Pittsburgh delicacy.  Unfortunately I didn't take her advice because I didn't want to ruin my dinner, but a gentleman down the bar made sure to let me know I was making a mistake. I'll take his word on it. I ended up ordering a special, which was a chopped up steak sandwich and a side of fries. Add in a couple of pilsners and I was a happy camper.  One quick note, I dined before a baseball game. While I enjoyed my visit, my meal and will highlight the happy hour, I'm not sure if it's the best pregame place. I will say, I do think it's a great happy hour and dinner venue. You will get your fill of food and it matches up well to the beers on tap. If you do stop before a game, I recommend eating a lighter dish.",

I could've sworn he was British also,.. but he just happened to have a deep 'New Jersey accent'.  If any of you are a fan fried chicken sandwiches, I definitely would recommend ordering one from here!! Their sweet and spicy pepper relish seemed questionable at first but after the first bite, my taste buds danced with such delicious-delight. Fries are good, but Cody also recommended to try their Mac 'n cheese... wholly smokes! I was ready to die a happy man!!!  Alright that's enough 'song and a dance'...lol you get the pic",

Lots of tables about half full so busy but not slammed. However OWNERS YOU NEED MORE SERVERS! No service for well over 15-20 minutes- we finally got up and asked for a server and a very nice BUSY young man finally took our order! That was bad, we were so hungry and got really cranky! And then in less than 10 minutes our food arrived ALL at once hot and Delicious - One of our best meals in Pitt. We had the oysters, the pulled pork and I had the grilled cheese with bacon.  Everything was Great!  Once fed I began watching the flow - we had only 2 waiters for about 20 tables - not all full but really NOT enough staff- our waiter never returned to bring our check (because he was sooooo busy getting guests fed!) that we had to go find our check - we gave him a great tip because he really was doing all he could do - so staff 10 stars Food 10+ Stars Staffing person 1 Star - note to Owners - I know your new but STAFF UP!! It's better to have to pay a few extra employees while working out the kinks than have paying guests leave because of understaffing - Your wine list is better than most - Your Beer choices are good - I love the water bottles on the table and (although I had to go to the bar to get more water) I was very happy to receive 2 pre filled, cold bottles - your FOOD is AMAZING and so nice to have several waiters deliver the entire table hot food all at once.  The Foundry is welcome option to the North side - we will defiantly be back and hope your staffing issues are fixed.",

I can't give any of the food superlatives, but it was better than many of the federal street places near PNC Park. Definitely looking for a different crowd than Asiago. We did have problems with the wait time. We didn't expect 1.5 hours for lunch, especially burgers and chicken sandwiches. Only real food fail were 2 burgers ordered medium well that came rare even after the long wait.I can't give two thumbs to the fries as they were broken pieces in a tin cup. They were cute but not worth getting out the thesaurus to describe their deliciousness.  Being perfectly fair the manager apologized and took the burger meals off the check, which was the right way to treat a customer, and appreciated.  They have only been open 5 days so I expect they need and deserve some time to work out the kitchen kinks. I'll try them again.",

The bacon was decently thick slices crunchy but not so cooked that they shattered when you bit into the sandwich. The fries were perfectly seasoned. The foundry burger with a fried egg is a must. The beef blend was cooked perfectly to medium, juicy and flavorful. I would be interested in trying out their entrees and bar snacks too. A must stop if you're on the North Shore and want locally sourced food and not garbage from a chain restaurant.",

The chef adapted the fried chicken sandwich to be dairy free, while very nice was dry and lacked flavor. It did have an unusual spice on it, maybe cardamom, which was interesting but not enough to make it good. The fries, which people rave about in other reviews, were pretty tasty but still just French fries. Pork belly bites are good and even better, when paired with the brisket hash, although both needed salt to bring out the flavors. The highlight of my wife's meal was the drink She had, The Monroe. Light and refreshing. Go for drinks not for food.",

The wait staff was super attentive and nice, considering there were about 30 of us who steadily got more and more drunk as the night progressed.

The ambiance & decor are perfect! When being sat, I love that there are multiple different settings to choose from. On a nice day the best is being able to enjoy the awesome city and river views from the outdoor patio in the back! The bar area in the front was a great spot to meet up with friends & watch the game. Afterwards we went the the back to get some food.   Every time i've gone, we always split a bunch of things with the table because we couldn't decide on just one thing. Every dish we ordered was amazing! We all especially loved the pierogis, pickle brined fried chicken sandwich & the grilled cheese sandwich!! SO GOOD! We ate until we were all stuffed and couldn't believe how inexpensive our bill was, especially for such quality food! They'll be changing the menu regularly to match what is seasonally available and best so i can't wait to come back again & see what they come up with next! This place is exactly what the North Shore needed! It's not just another chain or mediocre bar food, it's locally owned and has a more upscale feel without going overboard! I highly recommend checking it out!",

It started well with us being asked to move outside because it was unseasonably warm for October and they accommodated us.  After that though, it was all downhill.  It took us a half hour to get our drinks.  The beer menu is average for what's on tap.  No sours on tap, but whatever, I ordered a grapefruit beer that they were out of.  We ordered apps that we waited and waited for. We asked where they were and got a \"let me check\" like we were bothering our waitress.  Not 30 seconds later our entrees came out.  No one was crazy about their food.  My fish was way sweeter than the menu let on.  Another thought the chicken sandwich was overdone, my wife said the steak was just okay.  Also \"okay\" brussel sprouts. My wife thought the cauliflower was good, I thought it was just average. We thought the pork belly bites, beet salad, and meat and cheese platters were good. Not one of us loved their entree. They did comp us for the apps because they came out after the entrees so we appreciated that.  Service was below average.  Food was below average.  We won't be returning.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in here before a killer show at Stage AE last night. We chose this place because we weren't really interested in any of the others that are in that immediate area.  Atmosphere: It was about 6:00 and we were worried there might be a wait, but to our surprise the place looked empty when we walked in. Not a single person in the small dining and bar area, aside from the hostess. It was a little off putting at first, I'm not going to lie. While I don't like to wait long for a table, I also don't want to eat at a ghost town. We got seated right away, though, and the hostess led us back a hallway to the main seating area. There were a handful of other parties in the back, which was nice to see. The aesthetic of the place is rustic/industrial, which I like, even if it is over done at this point. They did some cool stuff I haven't seen before with it too, so I enjoyed peeping at those details. Pretty good tunes playing over the speakers as well. Could have done without the TV's on the wall next to my table, but I get it. Being so close to the stadiums, I'm sure they get a decent crowd of fans in there on game days. They have a really nice outdoor patio that overlooks the river, but it was cold and rainy when we were there, so maybe next time.  Food: The menu is on the smaller side, but I'm okay with that because they had several options I would have eaten, and I've  The read in other reviews that they change their offerings somewhat frequently. I ended up getting the Pickle-brined Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries and their homemade ranch (I'm assuming it was homemade because it wasn't typical and was very tasty). The sandwich was a good size, and if I wasn't going to the show directly, I probably would have only eaten half at the time, but I gorged myself instead. The chicken thick and super crispy which I dug. I was expecting more of a pickle taste, but it really wasn't there. Though, I suppose I'd rather it be too little than too much when it comes to pickle chicken. The sandwich had actual pickle chips on it and I think that's really where all the pickle flavor came from, not the \"pickle-brined chicken\". The fries we also good. Just a little too salty for me, but dipping them in that wonderful ranch helped with that. My wife got the Grilled Cheese with Bacon. I had a bite and the cheeses they used had great flavor together.   Drinks: Pretty good draft list. And they broke it all down by style, which is always super helpful to me. I got the Destihl Gose because why wouldn't I pair a sour beer with pickle chicken. Hind sight, it may have been a bit much, but since the pickle chicken wasn't all that pickly, it all worked out. They also had a large bottle selection, wine, and cocktails.   Overall, we had a good experience, and I'd probably go back again. Pricing was reasonable (totaled $31.xx plus tip) and the food was good. Hoping to check out that patio on a nice summer's eve.",

The coffee was very good, the woman even put it in a to go cup for me! She also warmed it up and added a little more before I left. We were sharing plates and the food runner brought us more plates and was very pleasant.   Tonight we walked in with a party of seven, the hostess basically said we cannot seat you tonight. That is all she said, we asked if we were allowed to go to the back bar and her reply was \"yeah, I guess\". I was just disappointed, I thought she would have presented us with options as like splitting up our party and so forth. But she did not. We went to the back back and it was totally empty, which was great! We all sat down and the man bartending was super nice, friendly, had great recommendations and never left us with an empty drink. He even split the checks for us and didn't blink an eye when we asked. Tonight the food did not come out as perfect as the first time, I understand it was wayyyy busier than the first time but it was still good. The one girl who joined us for dinner said it was the best grilled cheese she ever had. I had pumpkin pierogies, and the market salad. My fiance had the pulled pork, he loved it as well!  I was surprised a 16 oz blue moon was $7.00, quite honestly the most I've ever seen blue moon be charged.   I understand we were in a high traffic area and they were busy, but the servers were running in front of guests and basically pushing them aside. I found that quite rude.   Definitely worth a try and I will look forward to coming back to give this place 5 stars!",

The sandwich was just fine and local greens was literally a bowl of spinach. A bowl of spinach. Nothing on it, nothing in it. Who likes to eat plain spinach?? Our waitress was attempting to be nice but she ended up just having a bad attitude the entire time. She argued with one of my friend's beer choice, insisting it was tapped when my friend just had a sample of it at the bar. Instead of checking for him he made him go back up to the bar to verify that they indeed had the beer he wanted. She asked in the beginning how we wanted our checks split, and verified that there were three separate checks. Once our bills came back they were completely messed up. We politely told her and she apologized and said she'd fix it, but instead of fixing it she came back, threw one bill on the table and told us to figure it out. This could have been a good experience but it definitely fell short.",

    "text": "Stopped into the Foundry before the Pitt home opener. The place is gorgeous. Small bar upfront with a rustic/industrial feel. Follow the hallway down and The Foundry just keeps revealing more of its awesome atmosphere. For such a large place, it feels quite intimate. Rotating beers on tap, wine and cocktail menu.  I ordered a Bloody Mary** which was mixed very well and my friend ordered a glass of wine. Nice selections to choose on the menu.  We opted for three small plates so we could maximize what we were trying. The roasted tomato pierogis were delicious. I never would have paired tomato in a pierogi. The sauerkraut side with it was a nice touch. I think adding two more pierogis to the dish for the price would be optimal.  The duck fried nuts...oh my. Totally decadent. A real treat! The thyme was a nice compliment. A little sea salt added to the dish would make that really pop! The pork belly bites. Let me tell you this...when there is pork (especially the belly) on a menu, I'm ordering it. These were definitely my favorite. The crispy edges topped with the fresh jalapeno made the perfect marriage! We sat at the bar and our service was excellent and I think the prices are somewhat fair.   Not bad at all for only being open a week! Can't wait to try more on the menu. If you're looking for great food and drink that's not going to break the bank in the North Shore, get here!   **The Bloody Mary was really good, but I think needs a signature garnish. Topping one of those with a lemon/lime, jalapeno, pork belly bite and either hot, pickled green bean or okra would really knock it out of the park!",

It cost $67.60. The portions were *tiny* and tasted mediocre. We waited an hour to get our entrees. The beef was a small piece of over cooked and slightly dry meat. No sauce. No carbs. The pasta was a small bowl of pasta with pesto sauce. The dessert was a teaspoon of ice cream and a quarter of a cold peach with grill marks. The servers were brisk and inattentive. An hour and a half later all we had done was waste a lot of money. We stopped by taco bell to get food on our way home.",

It has a nice spicy balance to the greasy pork with the jalapenos.  Next was the pimento cheese dip.  I expected it to be warm but it was not.  It was good but not amazing.  The pickled onions on the side did kick it up a notch but not enough to order again.  Last was the clams.  These were under whelming and had an overpowering pork taste.  It was so strong you could not taste anything else.  We also tried the deserts.  We had the ricotta cheese cake and the chocolate tart.  Both fell flat and lacked flavor and did not deliver on  the sweet that o crave after a meal.  The service was fine as to be expected.  A plus was the space.  This is a large place with nice outside seating.",

Really impressed with their flexibility too; I had to call on three separate occasions to change the time for my ridiculously indecisive family members. :p This kindness extended into our dining experience: our server was the absolute best! She was very personable and acutely sensitive to a family member's special needs. Unfortunately, her name escapes me-otherwise I would shower her with compliments in this review. Regardless, I hope the management can use this as encouragement for their servers in the ongoing battle of customer service. :) All in all, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was chill.

HOWEVER, I'm here for the Pitt vs Penn St game and this place is HORRIBLY mismanaged. There is one poor bartender at a bar of about 300 customers. The crowd is way, way past Fire Marshall capacity! Like 'if something happens people will die' past capacity. It's ridiculous. We got here early enough to get a table and ordered food and drinks. The waitress said she couldn't get our second round because of the crowd, and doesn't see that changing anytime soon. It's been 30 mins... It's unfortunate to say, but places run this poorly never stay in business. Idk who spent all the money to open this place just to throw it away with mismanagement, but they did. Epic fail!

The Korean Fried Chicken was my personal favorite- the flavor was fantastic although I could see why some would say the prices are high for the portions. But when a place calls itself a gastropub I don't think that should be a surprise. The pickle-brined chicken was awesome (but definitely not enough chicken on that huge bun) and the french fries were some of the best around.  The beer selection was great from a visitor's perspective with quite a few local beers but a lot of the taps are full of the typical big breweries masquerading as craft brew. The major downside was that service took forever when we came in on a Monday at 1:30 and didn't get out of there until 3... I would hate to see what it would be like on a game day or any typical dining period.",
