After that she came and took our food order, we got the Monday special - $5 burger and fries. Then we saw her sitting a few tables over on her phone. We waited longer than we should've on a slow night and she was still sitting there. I told my husband, \"I bet our food is sitting in the back and when she goes to check on it, it'll be out.\" Sure enough, when she finally went back to the kitchen, she brought our order out. The temperature was luke-warm. The food was fine, the specials are pretty cheap, but the service was very sub-par. If you're going to be on your phone, at least go to the back or something to do it, not right in front of the customers. 2.5 stars.",

You can't bring food for 14 out in an hour an a half, and you comped me for my food that I never got..... Thanks for not charging me for the food I didn't receive.... I went to Spoonwood brewery and got my food and beer in 16 minutes. Thanks even though the food at your establishment good(this is why I picked this venue for my birthday) , I hope you close soon...there are way better places that don't waste your time...",

We weren't sure of the food so we decided to test the pretzel. It was incredible. So, we ordered the pot roast nachos at the recommendation of the bartender, along with a flatbread. Within minutes a waitress asked if ordered nachos with a sandwich. We told her no we ordered a flatbread with nachos. So, she set them both on the far end of the bar. Ten minutes later, the same server came back out of the kitchen, retrieved those old nachos, and served them to us stating that they were made in error but they would give them to us since it's what we ordered. WTF? Great. We didn't want to complain. Just nachos. But, they were cold and gotten nasty. Then came out the flatbread. Forgetting the 8 inch hair on top, we ate one little piece and said forget it. It was gross. This place should not serve old food to customers. This place should not serve flatbread AT ALL.",

I wanted their Cuban sandwich, which was from the correct menu, and was told they never have that item. So I ended up just ordering the same meal as my boyfriend. We ordered barbecue bacon cheeseburgers, weren't asked how we wanted them cooked and they arrived about 45 minutes after ordering. Upon arriving, they did not come with bacon or barbecue. When we told the waitress about the missing ingredients (she had to ask us what was supposed to come on the burger after we told her the name of the burger), she said that she would just bring the ingredients on the side. So once we assembled our burgers, we were pretty over it. If it were during a game or a large concert, I would totally give some leniency in the situation. But this was not a busy night. Speaking of games, the Pens game was going on across town and wasn't even playing on the tv. We definitely will not be going back.",

Negative: pretty inattentive waitress. We ordered, got the drinks fast, and that was about it. The appetizer took forever to come and so did the food. When the food did come, I asked for ranch and never received it. I couldn't even ask again because our waitress didn't check on us until she brought the bill. I got the California Chicken Club. Bacon was only on one half of the sandwich, the bread was soggy, and the chicken was kind of tough.  My boyfriend ordered a burger that he said was only okay at best.  Next, our waters weren't refilled until after the bill, cause like I said, she only came to check on us once she asked if we were done.  Once she brought the bill, it took her 10-15 more minutes to come pick up the debit card. Then another 5-7 minutes to get our own debit card back to us. I'm not one to complain much cause I used to be a waitress too and understand how it can be, but I felt this review was necessary since the food and service was not good.   Probably wouldn't go back again.",

We were next door at the Beerhead bar and ordered food from Local Brewhouse.  I get more and more excited every time the Amp'd group opens up a new restaurant because they never seem to disappoint.  They are very good at providing good food and a fun atmosphere in whatever they venture to do and Local Brewhouse is no exception.  We were ordering during game 5 of the stanley cup finals and during an intermission, so I imagine there was a lot of food orders being put in.  Fortunately, the wait for our food was only about 20-30 minutes, and everyone enjoyed what they got.  Their sweet potato fries might be a little bit too sweet though, and I was disappointed they didn't have a menu item for loaded fries.  Luckily, nobody had anything bad to say about their food and it came quick considering the event and environment of the evening.",

My friend went with the pretzel appetizer and she said she wasn't very impressed with it. After much debating I went with the Buffalo chicken dip because you can't really go wrong with Buffalo chicken dip right? The dip came out with puddles of grease and oil on the top. Not just little spots but actual puddles. Right off the bat I was pretty hesitant to eat a lot of it with the amount of oil I could already see. Thankfully appetizers were half off for happy hour so it was only $4 but I would never pay the full price for something like that. If you looking for a spot to grab drinks on the north shore i would recommend it but I recommend you stay clear of the food.",

I think that the Local brewhouse is confused that this location is on Federal Street (on a non game day/ baseball season) not Carson Street.

Maybe i am too old for the \"clubbin\" scene, but I thought that 6 pm was a little early for \"Country Grammar\" by Nelly to be the background music.  And as I glanced around, it seemed like the demographic (skewing a little older) thought the same.    Food was average, service was average.    At one point, at about 7:30, i looked over to the server station and every one of the 5 servers were on their phones, one was even just sitting at the bar.  I get the new generation and love of technology, but at least try to hide it from the customers.  It just reads \"I will get to you when I am done checking my social media\".

I'll get straight to it, our waitress was quite unprofessional she kept having to pull her pants up because clearly they were too small for her. I asked if a specific television can be changed to a specific football game and she replied with \"that TV don't change channels\", then about 5 minutes later another waitress was able to change the channel on the exact same television. We ordered the nachos with meat, the issue here is that the meat wasn't shredded so whenever I picked up a piece of meat a long string of meat would be pulled which was quite annoying for eating nachos and there were only 2 pieces of stringy meat in the whole thing. The worse part was finding a piece of body hair in the sour cream, after that was spotted I requested for our check and left, I didn't bother with informing the staff because with such horrible service I figured not a thing would be done plus I was already grossed out. The plan was to sit through the football game and drink plenty of beers, but after all that I ended up at the bar down the street; which, was much more pleasant. So much business was lossed that day.

Great wings especially for 60 cents. It was a nice day so they had the large patio doors/windows open which was nice. The bartender Justin was friendly, and attentive.",

It was a warmer day and a Corona sounded good, however, they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar. The only thing that I thought was off was that we asked for limes and the bartender had one left. It was only 1pm, so I wasn't sure if they were going to get more or the bartender was just too lazy to cut a fresh one. That really annoyed me. Other than that we had great service. We ordered the spinach dip with Pita. It was really good. The couple next to us got sandwiches that looked delicious and they seemed to enjoy. I can see why some people would complain about slow service as this is directly across the street from PNC Park, so I'm sure it gets insane when there is a home game. I always take these complaints with a grain of salt b/c the restaurants get so slammed and the staff tries their best to keep up with the craziness.  I will definitely be back to check out more of their menu options.",

We only had water to drink so I can't comment on the drinks, though it looks like they had a good selection.   We shared a number of appetizers including the pretzel duo, the buffalo chicken dip, the pot roast nachos and side orders of fries. The fries were like thick cut steak fries and were good when they were hot but quickly got soggy with grease.   The pot roast nachos were just ok. I think they would have been better served hot but when they came out they were totally cold. Not sure if they were meant to be served cold. The taste was still good but I would have preferred them hot. The buffalo chicken dip was the best item, a generous portion served hot and just the right amount of spiciness and creaminess.   Probably would come back to drink but wouldn't seek this place out to eat again.",

Finally when we were ready to leave we flagged down our serve who just looked at us and didn't even acknowledging us. Finally got the other server to at least get our checks.

We all got drinks, but there was no chance for any of us to get second drinks. We were there around an hour and 15 minutes. With how slow service seemed, about 20 minutes before we wanted to leave, we made sure to grab the check since we thought it might be a while before we saw the waitress again. They did have some good craft beer options and I loved that they had Arsenal ciders.  If you want a place to grab a drink before a baseball game, this is a good location, but it's slow. I don't think I'd go back, but it wasn't bad. So, if you have a lot of time and want to grab a cheap drink, check it out.",

YUM!   Food was awful. Cheesesteak on a hot dog bun. Couldn't find the peppers or onion that was supposed to be on it. Meat tasted freezer burned... wife's salad was good as was the soup. There are so many better places in the Burgh to eat. How this place stays open is beyond me... Try Southern Tier, the Foundry, hell Tequila Cowboy has better food.",

I had The Douglas sandwich with sweet potato fries and my wife had the Turkey Avocado BLT Wrap with chips. We both enjoyed our food and it came in a relatively timely manner. I didn't find out that the sweet potato fries had an up charge until I got the bill though. It took a pretty long time to get the check once we were finished but overall service was average and it was a nice experience. On another note, it is rather misleading to have Brewhouse in the name because no beers are brewed there and it isn't a brewery or brewpub.",

Being so close to PNC Park makes it a great place to get a bite to eat before a game but be forewarned, it's overpriced. They essentially serve good bar food but charge you twice what you would expect. The wait staff is friendly but every time I've gone, they seem to be short handed (or permanently understaffed?) so service is slow. There's obviously bad communication between the host & the servers. If you're looking for a quick drink, you might be ok at the bar but be warned the drink specials aren't what they seem. Game day - No specials. And if they say all drafts are $4, they apparently don't mean ALL drafts. They do have a decent happy hour appetizer special but again, game day - no deal. Idk who came up with that marketing strategy...    Pros: good food, nice staff, & prime location  Cons: slow service, ambiguous specials, & overpriced",

Note to self: if a restaurant is rather empty, but you still have to seat yourself.... and then ask at the bar (twice!) if someone is going to take your order.... it's probably not going to be a great experience. And then if utensils and napkins have to practically be begged for, it just adds insult to injury.   There's a great (!!!!) beer menu.... and the appetizer menu has all of the usual wings and nachos and chipy dippy thingies. I had a delicious hard cider (on tap) and the Pretzel Duo (two baked soft pretzels served with beer cheese & honey mustard). The cider was delicious, but it would have been even better if served in a glass rather than a plastic cup. The pretzels were drenched in butter, but nice and warm. The honey mustard was nothing more than a salad dressing or a sandwich spread.... and the cheese (while super tasty with little bits of hot peppers in it) was not warm enough for actual dipping.",

Gave us the wrong appetizer, my salad was a totally different one, and when the correct one came it had a diff lettuce than the one he told us it had, and my husband had to ask 3 times for silverware - before getting up and getting it himself.  Once we got the right food and something to eat it with, the Brussel Sprouts appetizer was amazing, everything else was okay.     Then my husband took a bite of the hummus with olives appetizer and bit into an approx 1 inch X ..5 inch piece of glass.  Not cool.   Took us a while to get the waiter to come back, we showed it to him, and he went to get the manager, then he came back without the manager and said she said to ask what you want instead.   NOTHING, we were done with our meal at that point - very silly question.   The Manager then came and apologized and said she was looking into the glass (good).     She took the $9.00 off our bill for the Hummus!    Bad experience, mediocre food, and only 9.00 off our bill for a serious piece of glass.  Diners beware!",

    "text": "Great first visit to Local Brewhouse (LB)!  Before LB there was BZ bar and then before that - Firewater's I think?  I hope LB sticks around because its perfect fit for the location and Pittsburgh/Yinzers of course!   The menu contains plenty of \"Pittsburgh\" personality and is quite extensive. I love the names of some of the burgers \"Three Rivers Stadium\" and \"The Steelworker\".  Very clever!~   Parking:   Off street parking is available nearby definitely within walking distance but tough to find.  The lots around PNC are pricey.  Just a few blocks away (short walk) I parked at the General Robinson Street Garage and it was only $4.00!   The duration of my visit was over an hour too.     Ok let's talk about the food!   Spinach Artichoke Dip:  I was skeptical about the tip by the appearance of it.. it looks as if it was dip I would have made at home in my microwave and it was all cheese.  It was ok; you can taste the spinach and artichokes, cheese and plenty of butter.    Wings:  I really liked the selection of the wings offered.  It's refreshing to see new flavors and not the same old standard boring flavors such like bbq, garlic parm etc.  Flavors on the menu:  Spicy Sriracha, Mango Habanero, Spicy Thai, Spicy Parm etc.  There are a dozen of flavors to choose from and even some rubs too! I decided to try the \"spicy parm\" since its one of my favorite blends and they exceeded my expectations.  My friend Jennie even liked the wings - and she doesn't usually like spicy food.  I have found that \"spicy\" is often labeled as \"hot\" and that is not the case.    Aidan Steak Sandwich:  Steak, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, blue cheese, and spring mix on ciabatta bread.  Sandwiches come with \"homemade\" chips, but I prefer Fries and there was no substitution, so I had to pay extra for fries.   The fries were interesting, thick square cut and very tasty.   Atmosphere: Modern with a rustic feel.  The bar is spacious and so is the dining area.  Restrooms are located in the basement and were clean.     Service:  It was good. The food didn't take long to arrive and we received our check right after asking for it.  The prices are slightly above average but because of the location that is to be expected.  It was a TERRIFIC first visit and looking forward to heading back and trying one of their burgers.    Thanks Local Brewhouse!",

The Buffalo chicken dip was the most interesting thing I've ever seen as it was very oily and it was very hard to find any chicken. The cocktails on the other hand were yummy. I enjoyed this special Girls Night Out made with Firefly Spiked Tea and it was delicious. This is more of a place you end up at not somewhere you plan to go.",

Here you'll find typical bar fare with exceptional burgers and sandwiches that will surely satisfy your appetite. My husband and I watch Pirates and Pens games here often. His favorite indulgences are the Stella Artois battered pickle chips and any of the burgers. You'll find monster burgers such as the Steelworker, which boasts 4 cheese Mac n cheese sandwiched between two 1/4 pound patties, wrapped in bacon, deep fried in cider batter, topped with queso and jalapeno relish. Yup. That's the level of burger we're talking about here. Bring your appetite and your Pittsburgh spirit to this joint!  Also, they have a decent numerous of beers on tap, a good bottle list, and a surprisingly decent wine by the bottle list (for a sports bar). They are generally lacking in the wines by the glass, though.  They lost a star for me due to lack of general food allergy options and wines by the glass. Still, that's small potatoes for the usual clientele. Come and enjoy the new Local Brewhouse!",

    "text": "We came here on a whim, just looking for something to eat. We managed to luck out and arrive just after the pirates rush had cleared out, so we were seated almost immediately. There were a few tables still lingering in the restaurant, and the bar was fairly full.   Not sure if the place was recovering from after the pirates rush (though, not sure how much damage that could do on a weeknight), or what, but everything was slow. That's the only reason why I didn't do five stars. Our waiter took a little while to greet us, so we were all ready to order once he did. Food took a while to get out, but was still warm and tasted good.   I ordered the California club with regular house chips. Like I said, it took a while to make the food (only for a four top), but it came out nice and hot. I thought the club was really good- I would highly recommend it. The default side is the house chips and you can add on fries for an up-charge. I opted out of that, but the server brought us over fries anyway. I think next time I will opt-in for the fries, because they were really good. Another person at our party added sweet potato fries. They are waffle sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar on top- definitely recommend!  Overall, aside from just staying at the restaurant a lot longer than planned, we were really satisfied with the experience. The server was a really nice guy, cracking jokes, and the food was really good. Would recommend coming back, though maybe not after the pirates game rush",

The kids meal stated it came w a drink. Despite ordering one with the meal, it turned out that even though it was offered, that it is not included in to go issues. So basically we spent what equals to about $1.25 for each Mrs. T pierogis without any butter on it, ect.  Just 5 sad boiled, plain piergies that each cost as much as an entire box in the grocery store.   It was not good.   We also ordered soup. This is not at all what is served at the restaurant. Just take a look at the picture. I know soup to go isn't going to be perfect, however one expects some broth in soup.  It just a half container of vegetables and topping. The amount served for the price is shocking. Beyond shocking. A total rip off.   Lastly, our pizza flatbread. It was cut up into pieces and stacked on top of each other in a small box. This created a lump of mushy bread, sauce, and cheese that was completely stuck together. As my kid put it \"Gross, really gross\".  None of them would eat it. And they'll eat anything that halfway resembles flatbread or pizza.    This was horrible. Not what is served in the restaurant. What's advertised for the kids meal is incorrect. I won't be returning to the restaurant after being ripped off like this.    Please see the photos. It's bad. Really bad.",

If you don't step up and get a good kitchen manager this place will be closed in a year. The lunch staff is so slow. You need to realize that we ALL have to go back to work!   I can't even bother to review the food.",

I can't vouch for all the food, but I CAN say that when I first perused the menu looking for something that said, \"Steelers Victory\" the Pittsburgh Pretzel stood out.  It is a pierogie, sauerkraut and kielbasa sandwich on a pretzel bun.  It is Pittsburgh on a pretzel bun.  It is victory.  I'm not saying it's a lock, but I am saying that I've eaten that sandwich the last three consecutive home games...win, win, and win.    I didn't experience slow service despite it being gameday with a packed house.  Maybe I just got lucky.  But the service was good, the Pittsburgh Pretzel was good, and their beer offering was good.  Nice atmosphere and great location for the game makes this place my go to for prefunctioning.    Get there early on game day, or expect a 20-30 minute wait.",

If you can't clean your bathroom which people see, I can't imagine your kitchen!!!! Every toilet was filled with urine to the point that each one needs plunged. There was not a shred of toilet paper available, the only thing I am thankful for is that there was paper towels. I immediately told the waitress and asked to speak to a manager. He refused to come over. If you are planning on eating in the north shore please go elsewhere, I'm beyond horrified by what I saw. I wish zero stars was an option!!!!!!",

Arsenal (which is a cider made in Lawrenceville - local) and Fat Heads (Which is made in Ohio - not local). So in reality, they have one dedicated local tap. You could throw I.C. Light on there and make it two, but it's still wrong to call the place Local Brewhouse if you really don't have local brews. Pittsburgh is a great craft beer scene with a bunch of really good local beers. If you are looking for local go next door to Beerhead or across the river to Proper Brick Oven Pizza.",

After coming in and waiting to be seated I talked to three staff members one telling me that they were not serving food the other two saying yes so my group and I sat down waited 15 min just to get a server , when she finally came it took 15 more min to get our drinks , everyone around me was complaining about there service as well so against my better judgement I we ordered our food, after another 45 min and not able to order another drink during that time . I will not be returning there are many other places on the births hire to eat and this will not be one.",

Ridiculous. And my soup came with the flat bread - why not first?! And everything was just luke warm. I guess sitting for 30 minutes waiting to be delivered cools things down a bit. And the flat bread wasn't fully cooked. Ugh. Just bad bad!!! It's been bad all 3 times!!! I kept hoping it was just a fluke and would be better. It's not a fluke. It's just bad. Won't be back.",
