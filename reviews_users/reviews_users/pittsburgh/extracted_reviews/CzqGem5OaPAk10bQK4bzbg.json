I was told that lunch was over at 4 and was seated by an extremely rude host in the main dining room!!!!  Who continued to be abrupt while seating me!!! I then asked the server if there was any way way to get a burger. She said oh yes if you would have sat in the bar you could get one!!!!!!!! The host never told me this before I was seated!!!!! They're only concerned about getting a higher price point on their dinner menu!!!! Their food may be good but not worth the poor customer service. Will not return!!!",

    "text": "Una sera in DeLallo's  DeLallo's is a classy, homestyle Italian restaurant with white shirted, black bottom waiters and a roomy interior.  An evening at this fine restaurant begins by entering the doors and you will see the hostess  to the left and see a wide expanse of restaurant. You go to the right and you enter the bar. You go straight down the bar, hang a right and that's where we sat on Saturday with quite a few other tables. My dad and I were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and my uncle made us reservations for DeLallo's.  I was excited to visit after reading the menu in the car ride up.  Th evening continues with your water glass being promply filled and will remain filled throughout your meal.  The waitress comes to take orders, and the evenly paced meal begins with the ordering of our appetizers and meals. The menu is varied, but thorough and I had the impression that they would do a good job with anything you order.   We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the greens and beans for appetizers.  The mushrooms were cooked well and stuffed with crab meat and sat in a light lemon butter sauce. The beans in the greens and beans were perfectly cooked and were dressed in a garlic slightly buttery sauce that is also good for dipping bread in.  The bread came slightly after and it was fine. It was soft and thick, but it was like a thick sandwich bread (I wasn't too impressed with that).  I ordered their ravioli for my entree and I could choose a salad or soup to go with it.  I choose the Italian Wedding Soup and it was quite tasty. The pasta and vegetables were cooked well and sat in a flavorful broth with tiny meatballs. I possibly could have had a big bowl of soup as my meal! It was delicious.  I ordered the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. The ravioli were cooked well, the cheese had a good texture and the meat sauce had a good flavor of spices; extra red pepper never hurt anyone though!  Overall, a delightful way to spend a Saturday night.  The Evening Breakdown,  The Food: Very good. I felt a lot of care went into the food and the soup was really good. Honestly, everything was really good. The Experience: Very good. The waitstaff was attentive, the atmosphere was nice, the bathrooms were clean. The Value: Well, my ravioli was $13 if I recall, the appetizers vary in price depending on what you get.  For the classy type of restaurant DeLallo's wants to be, I think the prices are fair and just. Would I return?: If I was in Pittsburgh and my uncle wanted to go again then sure! 5 stars?: I can't think of any reason to give them 4 stars. DeLallo's does a good job and if you are thinking about giving them a try after a visit to South Hills Village, I think you'd be glad you did.  Grazie!",

We had no idea the bar area was larger than the dining room!  What a surprise.  Found the last 2 seats.  Ordered drinks.  Ordered an appetizer, the bruschetta.  What a garlic mess.  I can eat bread with tomatoes falling off at home.  Then upon leaving, I went to the dirty ladies room.  Came out and stuck my  head in the dining room to see how busy, or if we knew anyone.  A rude waitress came and very harshly said \"CAn I HELP YOU!!??\"  I said \"no, just looking\"  She yelled back \"I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOST\"!! Honey, my mom was a server all her life, would have never treated anyone like that.  Then to try to talk to my husband and tell him you just thought I was lost!! Seriously, chickadee, I know how to tip.  And if you were ever my server and treated us right, you would have a had a big tip.  But, now you'll never know, because we wouldn't grace the front doorstep of DeLallo's again!!  Get some manners!",

Their dinner menu is your basic steaks, chicken, veal, pasta, and pizza.  But I guess it still works 'cos the place is still pretty popular.   So before heading out on the road with my Cousin Cindy (who lives nearby), I stopped in here for lunch.   I'd seen this place many times from the \"T\" while on my way to South Hills Village.  I tried the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which was decent enough.  The Italian Wedding Soup was really good though.  And I topped my lunch off with a good  espresso.",

Long story short, one of my friends ordered something and after being sent back twice, was still wrong. Our waitress was no where to be found, therefore, we asked for manager who is actually the owner, waste of time. He didn't listen to problem ,was very abrupt, argumentative , and asked if she wanted something else. By this time the rest of party was done with meals and would have been the third time our friend would wait for a meal. No apology, no free dessert, nada, just an attitude and abrupt, I suppose in his little kingdom the customer is never right, only he is. Shortly afterwards, he was talking to a table with two of his loyal subjects about us since he was clearly pointing to us and the slick guy at table was talking with hand on face like a baseball coach discussing strategy on the pitching mound , was so obvious, juvenile, and pathetic with imp like behaviors. I've been here before, food is just ok, nothing outstanding, however, will never be back again, and will share this debacle with everyone I know.",

I cannot overstate how amazing their food is..it's fresh, delicious, and the staff is always courteous and attentive. We honestly must eat here at least 3-4 times a month. If you are looking for authentic, flavorful, and high-quality Italian food, then you must give these guys a try.   Their fried zucchini appetizer is out-of-this-world amazing! The zucchini is hot, crispy, well-season and never greasy. And it's served with a side of their famous marinara. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little taste of Italy before their meal.   For a main course, I'm always torn between my two favorite meals: the Chicken DeLallo and the Chicken Parmesan. The Chicken DeLallo is a chicken breast stuffed with crab, prosciutto and an Italian cheese with a white wine sauce. And the Chicken Parm is always cooked to perfection! It's crispy, yet moist on the inside and their marinara sauce is just absolutely amazing.   For dessert: my family always get's the Tiramisu. You must try the Tiramisu, I'm so serious. It's totally the trifecta to a complete meal at DeLallo's.   The service staff goes above and beyond their duty. Our waiter, whose name I'm blanking on (and I apologize, because you totally deserve a raise) was amiable and attentive. Overall the best customer service I've seen in years!   Recommendation: call ahead for reservations. This restaurant is extremely popular every day of the week, I swear, unless you arrive just as their opening you'll likely have to wait for seating.   10/10 would definitely recommend!",

My boyfriend ordered the blackened chicken alfredo and I had linguine pasta with lump crab meat, plum tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic and oil.  Both meals were delicious and filling! I ordered a strawberry shortcake to go which was also really yummy :)",

We love the balsamic dressing, I could probably drink it. For light lunch options we often get the trio-salad or the chopped salad. For dinner I always get the Chicken Maremana (gluten-free).",

Being our anniversary we started with a bottle of wine - a Chianti Ruffino, $26.00 not so bad for a restaurant. As an appetizer we ordered one of our favorites here - Green's and Beans with extra garlic. Basically they take a green, escarole, kale or turnip greens (what is in season), saute until wilted with garlic and olive oil and a bit of chicken broth. Toss in some cannellini beans (white kidney beans). Have a hearty Italian bread (Mancini's preferred) with butter on the side to sop up the flavor. YUMMY...  For dinner we both ordered the Virginia Spots done English Style. Virginia spots is a sweet, delicate fish. Not readily available in other parts of the country - to small and labor intensive. Leiostomus Xanthurus - Spot. They pan fry with flavored panko bread crumbs on top and a very delicate lemon cream sauce. This with the pasta of the day (bowties) is an awesome meal at any time. Never fishy or tough - delicate.  I really like there veal romano or crepe manicotti... Judee loves their veal saltimboca, they also make a chicken version - both are very good.  Another dish which they no longer have on the menu is the Mafalda Pasta - a wider noodle with a sauce to die for...  Do yourself a favor and stop here to eat.",

As a vegetarian, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of options. The online menu lists pizza, but when we arrived, the menu didn't have pizza. I was disappointed that the noodles with my marinara sauce weren't al dente, but were on the mushy side. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. We all enjoyed pecan balls for dessert. The service was really good. The crowd is a bit older, but we actually appreciated that it was quiet and we could hear and converse with one another.   I hope they update their online menu soon and I'd love to see more vegetarian options.",

I had broiled spots which I figured was a safe choice to eat and sounded delicious, while my boyfriend had the chicken. They were both delicious and we both agreed that the \"spots\" was probably the best fish we have ever had! Yum! I will definitely be going back to get more. We also both had the wedding soup which was also very delicious. It was a Wednesday night and not super busy, but it seemed to take a while to even get our order taken, so that is my only complaint. Other than that the food was excellent and staff was very friendly. We will be back again for sure. I would love to try their dessert next time because I heard it is great as well.",

I had the Italian hot sausage sandwich, which came with a choice of fries, coleslaw, or soup.  I went with the wedding soup and loved it so much I picked up a quart of it to go. The sandwich was great- really nice authentic homemade Italian sausage and fresh bread.  My grandmother had coleslaw with her sandwich and remarked on how fresh it was as well.

It's family run, clean, semi-formal, and a very nicely laid out, comfortable place to eat. Service is always outstanding, and they have a lot of long time waitresses, which speaks well of the ownership.  The food leans toward Italian, which is no surprise, and it's far and away the best Italian food in the South Hills. Ravioli is excellent - try it with their authentic marinara sauce. It's a chunky type sauce with olive oil, tomatoes, and vegetables. Really fresh tasting and different. Goes great with the meat or cheese ravioli's. Also recommended is the seafood ravioli! Try it with the Tomato Basil cram sauce. Outstanding!  Seafood dishes are also top notch. Love their Spots. I'm not sure if they're always available, but if they are, order them. Also have a high quality fish sandwich - I do wish they went to regular fries though instead of the thick wedge fries they serve.   I've never had anything but an outstanding meal at DeLallo's!",

The decor and atmosphere was nothing innovative, but it was clean and the tables were clothed.  The service was pleasant and our orders were completed accurately.  Our meals were delicious and proportioned above averagely.   This isn't your 'take-a-companion-you-really-want-to-impress' type of joint.  It's more of an 'I'm-in-an-established-relationship-and-we-just-want-a-hearty-meal' spot.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Food is consistently good and servings are generous. We typically have take home bags. The Virginia Spots with crab are simply fabulous and are hard not to order every visit, but the Chicken DeLallo in Madeira Sauce with goat cheese is a worthy choice when not in the mood for fish.  Mussels were tasty, but a bit too salty for our liking.  Desserts are amazing, but the old traditional Pecan Ball with hot fudge, caramel or both is a tough choice too. In this case, why choose? Be like me and get both! You will thank me.   Our server, Mike, was extremely friendly and efficient. He made our meal a very pleasant dining experience.   Although the restaurant may be a bit dated, it is a well run establishment and appears very clean. Older clientele mostly, but carries it's linen tablecloth old school Italian kinda charm throughout the generations that choose to visit. Mangia tutti!",

As far as the service goes, we were greeted kindly by the hosts, the bartenders as we waited for a table ( very busy on a Thursday night- good sign!) , and our lovely server Carole. Very down to earth people working here but also professional and everyone seemed very happy to be at work in this fine place! While we waited, i \"spotted\" a dish on a nearby table that looked like a delicately breaded something or other that just looked delicious whatever it was I was looking at. When we got seated I asked our waitress what I saw on that table, as it looked so beautifully cooked and good, and she said it was the Spots with lump crab on top. After much deliberation, I just couldn't pass up this dish- even though I've never had spots in my life and didn't know what to expect, I took the risk of ordering something new.. and I'm very happy to say I've found my new favorite dish at a new favorite restaurant in the south hills. I may get this ever time we come here, which will be often! Outstanding dinner for a random Thursday night out! Glad we stumbled upon DeLallo's!   Ps- if you have a bit of a sweet tooth post dinner, just go with the tiramisu... beautiful house made dessert!",

Nothing worse than getting those frozen cheese sticks from a box at a restaurant! I had the special, sword fish steak over sweet potato hash. The fish was great, but the sweet potatoes were just blahhhh. They weren't cooked all the way through and weren't seasoned enough. My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs and really enjoyed his meal. We split the peanut butter pie (again made in house) and both loved it. I would love to try the tiramisu next time! I should also mention the service was wonderful! We had a really great time at DeLallo's and will certainly be back!",

Maybe I haven't been to enough Italian restaurants, but I've never seen spots on the menu at any other place. It's a delicate white fish that is served in a buttery sauce and topped with crispy panko bread crumbs. So so good. Another tasty dish is the Pasta Farlenese, which has a tomato cream sauce. We've also tried the homemade ravioli and while they were ok, probably not the best I've tried. The dough seemed a little tough, but maybe it was just my batch? But their sauce served with it was pretty good.   I definitely recommend DeLallo's if you're in the area and looking for simple Italian.",

I chose the meatball sandwich and a side of the crab & corn chowder. The sandwich was piping hot when it came out, and our waiter graciously gave me a small bowl of the marinara sauce to dip my sandwich into. It was the perfect comfort food! The chowder was a tad salty, but I still enjoyed it because I was starving.   Other dishes that my family ordered were the chicken salad sandwich, eggplant parmesan (super cheesy), and the spots (most popular fish dish).   I'd recommend stopping by this place if you're looking for a locally homemade, soul-warming meal!",

Walking in, the restaurant is very outdated and old looking so we weren't impressed with the decor. Luckily though, the host and waiter were very nice and gave us excellent service. Scott was our waiter and was very accommodating. We tried their eggplant parmesan, chicken salad sandwich, meatball sandwich, and their broiled spots. The broiled spots was definitely the favorite as it was crispy from the panko crust, well seasoned, covered in lemon butter sauce, and served with tasty green beans & mushrooms. We also opted for their soups as appetizers, and enjoyed their Italian wedding soup and corn and crab bisque. Overall DeLallo's is a solid place for lunch, and I recommend stopping by if you're in the area.",

Even in the late 90s, this was the predominate style of restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It's not like the place is bad, but it's not exactly good either.    Don't expect any unique or interesting dishes - this is a standard Italian menu.  The pasta tastes like boxed pasta, the marsala is lacking any oomph, the bread tastes like it came from Giant Eagle, pretty much everything is just OK.  You won't run out saying its awful, you'll just wonder why you decided to eat here when there are so many better restaurants in town.    Are there reasons to eat here?  Sure, you can go on a Saturday night without a reservation.  You know the food will be edible.  Or maybe you are planning a night out with Grandma and Grandpa -- they will LOVE this place.",

For my main entree, I had the Linguine Salmon, which was covered in a creamy tomato and basil sauce. I was apprehensive of the salmon being mixed with that particular sauce, but it was so delicious! They serve you so much pasta that I have leftovers, which is nice! Collectively, everyone enjoyed their meals! I didn't hear any complaints! I would come back here again.",

We had calamari and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers and entrees of veal piccata and filet both with salad and baked potato.   The calamari was cooked perfectly with a light breading and none of the overcooked \"rubber\" texture that is sadly the norm at most places.   The crab stuffed mushrooms were also excellent with generous amounts of crab meat, again cooked perfectly and delicious.  Nice salads that took full advantage of Delallo's produce were served after the appetizers.  The veal picatta was cut with a fork tender, and the sauce had a great balance of flavor with the capers.   My wife's filet was also fork tender and cooked to a perfect medium / medium rare.  Both entrees  showed what high quality ingredients, cooked correctly can produce.  The service was also above reproach, the staff were attentive when needed but not overly so. The the meal was served in order, at the correct temperatures and with time between to enjoy each course, all indicative of professional staff that can properly service customers even with a full house.  All in all, a great little place with great food and excellent staff.",

I choose the main room and sat down at a booth.  I was immediately served and shown the specials of the day. With today being Ash Wednesday those specials were all seafood related. I opted for the salmon salad and since I had heard so much about their wedding soup requested a cup. I got both my soup with a nice bread roll and crackers in no time flat. The soup was out of this world good! I highly recommend it if you are coming to visit.  My waitress was gracious and very attending to my needs. While I was only halfway done with my soup my salmon salad was ready. It too was good except I felt that they have over-drenched it in Italian dressing. Still it did not stop me from enjoying my salad. It was one of the Lenten specials so there is no guarantee I would see it again next time I visit.  They specialize in both Italian and seafood dishes but they also have burgers,salads, sandwiches and pizza along with full course  meals. Take out is also available if you want to phone ahead or just pick up something on your way out the door. I noticed among those take out items was biscotti. Looked good but I was too full from my meal to buy any.  Speaking of desserts I was shown a dessert menu but it does not list prices on it. Among the offerings was my favorite strawberry shortcake. I learned that all cake desserts are $7.00. If you prefer ice cream you are paying about $2.75 or if you want pecan ball for $3.75. Believe me it was tempting but I was stuffed from my soup, bread, and salad that I decided to pass.  I also noticed that there is a plate charge if you decide you want to split your meal with someone. It is best to get here early because this place gets packed fairly quickly. It is located on Fort Couch Road if you are approaching South Hills Village from Bethel Church road. A definite return to check out some of their other offerings.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place given the reviews. Sadly it is nothing more than a mediocre Italian restaurant. Here's the run down. I ordered the calamari since so many people raved about it. Well it is greasy and flavorless while heavy handed on the breading. The marinara was tasteless to boot. Salad was tasteless which is surprising since it had peppers, onions, and olives. Tasted like bagged salad and canned olives. The Italian dressing tasted like water with some Italian seasoning thrown in. I ordered the angel hair pasta with seafood. The seafood was inedible -- shrimp was only cooked on one side (???) and the scallops were over cooked on half and properly cooked on the other half of the same scallop. How is that possible? The clams were too large for a pasta - better for a chowder - so chewy and unappetizing. The only saving grace was the house Cab that nicely numbed my mouth. Sorry, not the best Italian. More like a diner's attempt at Italian. Didn't bother with dessert.  Needed to edit for my husband's addition - service has been lacking as well. Our waitress Gabby was rude when we arrived and didn't win us over through the meal. They left our appetizer and salad plates in the table through dinner service so everything is crowded and messy. They were generous with drink refills so that's a plus. Finally my 12-year-old ordered the crab cakes and commented, \"I've had better.\" Will not return next time we visit the Burgh.",

    "text": "Came here on Sunday evening. Would recommend reservations, because it is quite busy. Their menu consists of classic Italian dishes for reasonable prices. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, because I had it before and remember it being wonderful. It came with either soup or salad. My friend ordered the prime rib.   After bread and salad, the eggplant parm came out. It was steaming hot with a layer of melted cheese on top. Their eggplant parm is amazing because it is layers of breaded eggplant, their homemade sauce, and small bits of italian sausage. The eggplant is not too thick and there is not too much breading. Their sauce is also wonderful. It is a hearty portion. The prime rib was also huge and cooked well. For desert, I had the tiramisu. It was very good, but a bit bitter for my liking.",

    "text": "It's fun to visit a new city and find a classic like DeLallo's!   We entered on a bustling Friday night at about 8:00pm and were quickly seated though the restaurant was still quite full.  Our waitress was a petite women who you could tell had been here for years!  What a treasure!  We began with a bottle of Chianti and the stuffed peppers with a plentiful basket of bread (the 'salt sticks' were a big hit). The peppers were really spicy and we found out later that the sausage is make in house.  Excellent start to the meal.  Next came salads, crispy, with house made Caesar and Italian dressings.    For our main courses, Schweety stayed traditional and enjoyed a large bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and I went for the veal Saltimbuca.  Four thin cutlets seared in thick prosciutto.   Overall we enjoyed our visit and would come here again if in the area.",

    "text": "Another reason I miss living in Scott Township, being able to come here on a whim. It's been around since I was a kid and a South Hills mainstay. Shopping at the mall always means lunch or dinner. Ravioli and wedding soup are authentic and remind me of my Nana's kitchen.  If you order the chicken Parmesan I suggest getting it to share with someone else because the meal is huge enough to share and still take some home. Salads are my lunch favorites. Lettuce is crisp and all the veggies are fresh.",
