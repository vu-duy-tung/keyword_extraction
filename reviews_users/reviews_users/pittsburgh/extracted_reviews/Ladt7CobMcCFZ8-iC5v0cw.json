It is cash only but who cares, stop by an ATM on the way.  3 full breakfasts including drinks was  20 bucks, what a deal.",

I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.  It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.",

Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.    Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a True cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!  Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.  Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.  Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.",

    "text": "On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat. We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking. Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food. The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient. After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor.  His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful. The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough? Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix. My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference. It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices. Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions. While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.",

Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It's a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what's to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and \"Hey Rayed\" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well. I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty fantastic! Always a great place to travel to, always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great and friendly. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "We came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured we'd give it another shot since it's pretty close to our home. It's still just OK. We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change. There are a lot of good diners in the area, so I doubt we'll be going back.",

If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made.   Here are the highlights:  -Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same. -Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm) -Cash only -Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack -About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products. -My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo",

The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!",

What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.

    "text": "Note #1: Gab & Eat is strictly CASH ONLY! An ATM can be found inside the CVS next door.   Note: #2: If you come by, you will likely have a wait in front of you as the small joint is very busy, particularly on a weekend morning. Be patient.   I almost ordered the \"mixed grill\".   That was until we spoke with a local gentleman during our wait who swore by their various burgers.   Afterwards, I caught a glimpse of that pulchritudinous, fat-marbled minced beef being pulled out of a deep, stainless steel pan in unsparing clumps with a top-heavy, thick-handled, coruscating disher only to be smashed upon an inexorably torrid, tabular, metallic surface.   Mine was ordered with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, mayonnaise, an adorningly wilted square of American cheese, and a fried egg.   Word of a good burger will always deflect my plans.   My only grouse with the burger is that it was a tad overdone, but it appears that G&E cooks them \"French Style\" like Steak N Shake does since I wasn't asked how I wanted it prepared. In spite of that, it was a pretty admirable burger, the best part of it being the flaky crust of what must have been a fresh-baked bun.   As I side, I ignored the seductive crackling noise the bubbling, churning fat made and decided on their potato salad, which made for an easy field goal. \"Just how mom used to make\" is SUCH a cliche, but I can honestly tell you all that as a potato salad cognoscente whose very alive mother makes what in his opinion is the best tuber salad ever, THIS very much approached Mum's own. It was warm (made to order?), fluffy, sublimely seasoned, had that blend of softness/crunch/savory/sweet I always look for, and was just effortlessly edible.  Gimme a bucket of it, and a glazed donut...to go!   For dessert, Kay and I shared a cut of their Cherry Walnut pie, the only confection they had left for the day. One could merely deduce from first glance alone that the most affectionate archetypical grandmother made it...from scratch with its brown, sugar-encrusted dough and pasty, tart filling. Upon digging in though, I found that it was almost as toothsome as it looked. Not that anything was terribly wrong with it, mind you. It was very good, in fact, but there was just something missing that I cannot finger at the moment.   Some people might complain about the Polaroid-strewn, graffiti-laden walls, narrow structure, and olden decor, but damn it, that's one reason why people, myself included, are in love with diners; they're familiar, comforting, intimate, offer the basics we all crave, and if they've been around as long as the trees have, then you know they must be doing something right, and G&E does a whole bevy of things right.   P.S. I still like The Dor-Stop more, but G&E is worthy. I will come back for that mixed grill monstrosity and will vanquish it.   P.P.S. As we waited, we saw a massive, bald man with a Bat-insignia of shaved hair right above his neck sitting with his back turned to us. When he stood up and walked towards us to exit the establishment with a young companion, he looked even more imposing with his long fur coat, ebony/ivory beard, and gold chain. As soon as we sat down in the booth the two men had just vacated, our lovely elderly server said to us, \"You know, that fella is a wrestler!\"  Being that I know a bit about pro wrestling, I asked what his name was since he did look familiar.  It turns out that we had a brush with Tony Marino, a local grappler who at one time performed in the ring as \"Battman\" and tag-teamed with the legendary Bruno Sammartino!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shawnblanchard.com%2Fdursowith%2F100_1624.JPG&s=3a3e64d5304d767a85fdc0bba82d681d9e17cca8427786d3902f3d9d0e252f06\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shawnblanchard.com/durso...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onlineworldofwrestling.com%2Fprofiles%2Ft%2Ftony-marino.html&s=9645b7e4db8f46352bd7c6b5b11004942d3b46a7288729c356e26600aeab1ccb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">onlineworldofwrestling.c...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTony_Marino&s=f00490050fb547daf5a4f9df3c70057a314c402c646b983bbd1a1902c32f2adb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onlineworldofwrestling.com%2Fpictures%2Ft%2Ftonymarino%2F05.jpg&s=5ede30200b4908338b06ca8aaff14366efcf559abce02c69341cf985386712f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">onlineworldofwrestling.c...</a>  Yikes!",

I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place.   Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!  My first impression is \"Eh.\"  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:    \"2 eggs and toast $x.xx\" \"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\" \"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\"  I'd rather go to a Denny's and order the \"create your own Grand Slam!\"",

The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!  Great diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it.

I walk in to a nasty glare by one of the waitresses before seating myself at a table covered in advertisements and a woman throwing menus at us before walking away. The waitress was a sweet old woman. She was nice, but hard of hearing and unattentive. Here's what I ordered: Two egg whites scrambled, links, Italian toast, and a half order of home fries. Here's what I got: Two scrambled whole eggs, Italian toast, and home fries. I addressed the missing links with the waitress and she asked me if I still wanted them. I was starved by this point and said yes. I heard her to go the chef and ask for them, to which the woman behind the grill screamed, \"For what? Do you have the slip? Where is it? Where does it say links?\" in a considerably nasty tone. The eggs were mediocre, the home fries were unevenly cooked (mostly uncooked potato chunks, some practically ash), the links were so tasteless I stopped eating them as soon as I recognized I was full, but the toast was lovely. The prices are ok, but I'd prefer a college student's hungover cooking to coming back here.  Update: 30 minutes after leaving I got a vicious headache. 500 milligrams of acetaminophen later, my headache has gotten worse, new unpleasant symptoms have come along, and I may have contracted food poisoning.  Update 2: I have food poisoning. 100% definitely food poisoning. I haven't eaten anything but pretzel rods and nutrition bars before breakfast here since 1pm the day before. I obviously haven't eaten since. There's actually no other place I could have contracted it.",

There's something so nice about hearing the eggs hit the griddle and waffles being made while you sip your coffee from a random old mug that someone probably donated that the atmosphere is a comfort unto itself.  The menu is pretty standard for breakfast diner food, but excellently prepared. On top of the standard menu there are always specials that aren't quite seasonally contrived but still closer to having fresh ingredients in season which is always a joy. Prices are also as good as they come in the Pittsburgh region which is another great selling point.  It can get a little crowded if you're waiting for a table but in my eyes, you can't beat the bar that overlooks the work station but I know that's not for everyone.  It is cash only with an ATM on site which isn't a bad thing just something should be known.",

    "text": "Gab & Eat...two things I am very proficient at.  Having been told how great Gab & Eat was by my better half we went and checked it out this weekend. It's in a little strip mall next to a Barber Shop in Carnegie. Barber Shop's and a greasy spoon. Say no more!  The restaurant is long and narrow inside and there is a bar which you can sit at and watch the cooks produce their goods, and goods they are. We had to wait a few minutes for a seat to open and we sat ourselves promptly. Our server took our order for beverages while we checked out the menu. I had coffee as did she. Their coffee is a bit on the weak side, so if you're expecting a pick me up, look elsewhere. It's diner coffee.  I chose to have two eggs over medium, home fries, sausage patties(one of each, hot and sweet) and Italian toast. The toast was easily 1-1/2\" thick. Evidently the sausage is made specifically for Gab & Eat from what I gather. It's good. In fact it's probably some of the best breakfast sausage I'd ever ate in a restaurant. The seasoning was perfect. My eggs were a hair underdone for over medium, but they were still very good. The home-fries were both soft and crispy at the same time. They were fantastic.   I also ordered two pancakes. Being as I'd never been I figured I'd better try them, you know, for science sake. They were good. Nice and fluffy, good flavor and not burnt. Definitely should've just ordered one.  She had the 1/2 Mixed Grill add mushrooms and half of a Belgian waffle. She loved it. The Belgian waffle remained crispy even after applying the necessary maple syrup.   Gab & Eat is everything that I like. It's been there for a long time. It's a very local place. It has a history. It's not a fly by night diner or an experimental breakfast joint. What they make stands the test of time and it's just plain good.",

The toast was more than an inch thick and was honestly more like four slices. My wife couldn't even finish hers. It was a meal in itself. The omelet was weird - by far the most amount of ham I have ever seen in a breakfast, AT LEAST half a pound. But instead of being included in the omelet, it was just thrown on the plate, with a circular egg patty and cheese thrown on top. It was good, just not what you would expect for an omelet. Regardless, with the huge serving of toast, it was the most food we have ever gotten, all for only $15. The \"lazy\" omelet construction - and lack of a side of fruit - brought it down to four stars. But the price and flavor of the food, to go with the huge quantities, means we will probably go back.",

I didn't see anything on my way in stating that, but I could have missed it. It doesn't say Cash Only anywhere inside or on the menu either. There is an ATM, but it has a $2 charge to use.

Finally 2 seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.  Surprisingly we both ordered the same thing.. mixed grill. Mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon.   It was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes. Giant club sandwiches, super thick pancakes, eggs eggs and more eggs.. it was a fun time.   The restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food.   My only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese.

We would definitely recommend eating here to anyone who wants an outstanding breakfast and a friendly atmosphere!!!",

    "text": "Yum - freaking - me!  As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:  - Don't eat early in the week  - I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave   I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.  My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.  Food -   The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.       Portion -  This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.  Service -   My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.  Price -   The cost ranges $5 - 10.  I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants.",

    "text": "Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.  I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?    When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.     In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.  A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!",

I got a mushroom & cheese omelet with Italian bread. It was not what I was expecting at all - basically an egg taco filled with what looked like a mountain of canned mushrooms. It was actually pretty hilarious! The toast was so so so good though: grilled and buttery!  Also - even the half portion of the mixed grille was HUUUGE! And if you decide to get onion be prepared for what appeared to be an entire spiralized cooked onion thrown in the middle.   Good prices, big portions, I wouldn't get the omelet again but I'd go back!",

On the right side there's pictures of friends and family's dining and I thought that was cool. The left side had cool trivia questions so it's fun to quiz each other at the table.   For the food I ordered two eggs poached and they where cooked wonderfully. I got the homemade sausage one spicy and one regular to try both and I was impressed with how much flavor they had. Not to much spice and very balanced I put maple syrup on them and it was so mouth watering. I got Italian toast for the bread and was not impressed very thick slices and the crust was super hard but the center was soft. As for the French toast it didn't taste like it was cooked all the way and had Aton of butter on it and just like the toast the crust was super hard.   Overall I'll definitely come back to try it one more time but I'm not as impressed as I was hoping for. The staff here is wonderful and made sure she checked in a few times. One big thing that I liked was the tables are pre set and the waiter makes sure to put down 2/3 napkins so there already available as needed.",

Instead I typically get Italian toast with a side of omelette ;). Seriously though, I've only had omelettes and they aren't bad.  Straightforward.  I think my favorite is just a simple cheese omelette.  I'd skip the mushrooms though as they are canned.  I think canned mushrooms taste gross.  Once I just got peppers and onions which started off tasty but I think they just put too much.    The place itself is nothing special to look at.  I like the diner seating style, it's kind of nostalgic.  My OCD tendencies make me slightly bothered by the hodge podge of mismatching mugs.  But it gives the place character!  Anyway, back to the bread.  It's heavenly.  And they are generous.  Sometimes I day dream about the bread.  My husband thinks I'm crazy.  I think he's just jealous :)",

The food here is really good (try the hot sausage), the wait staff is wonderful and the price is better than Denny's. Even the coffee is really good. I can't believe I forgot about you guy's for so long. I'm sorry about that & I will be coming back. PS. NO loud and obnoxious music.. maybe a few loud customers , but that's not the restaurants fault. nobody uses their indoor voices anymore. 5 Stars Guy's !",

    "text": "I stopped in here due to a change in luncheon plans. Upon arrival the wait to be seated was horrific! Someone pointed to an empty counter stool so I sat there. I perused the menu fairly quick and decided to order half portions. I hadn't had a waffle in ages and I love home fries.  Since they both came in half portions I went with those. My waitress made sure I always had a fresh cup of hot tea since I was sitting near the entrance. It seemed like a long production line to wait for your order but it did not disappoint. When I got my half orders I was overwhelmed at the size!  The waffle was thick and fluffy and the home fries which bore a resemblance to hash browns were hot and greasy. Ketchup is on the counter as well as syrup. Yes they use real butter here since I could observe one of the chefs using a giant slab of it in preparation of orders.  I definitely plan to revisit this place when I have more time to try different things. My advice would be to prepare to take home a doggy bag since they give huge portions even if they are half size. The best part is that prices here are very reasonable and you can get a lot of food for what you order.  Gab and Eat is located in a small strip mall just on the cusp of the entrance to Carnegie. It is easy to miss if you are looking for a particular building.",

    "text": "Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.  Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.",

My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive.",

The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have \"dippy\" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a \"dippy\" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!",

    "text": "I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).",

Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.",

I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.  HUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.  I've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.  Cramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination.",
