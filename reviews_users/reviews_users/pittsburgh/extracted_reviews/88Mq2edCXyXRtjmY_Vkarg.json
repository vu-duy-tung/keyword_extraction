When I was 18, he catered my high school graduation party at my house. The food is delicious and comforting, the bartenders are great and really know how to make a nice, big Pittsburgh cocktail, and it really does not get any better for authentic Italian food, considering Rico has lived in the country for \"I don't know how many years\" and still has retained his accent!  I love his entire family  - they are all talented, beautiful, caring and you can taste the love in the food - which is the best kind.  I miss you, Rico!",

Sort of pricy, in my opinion, so go for lunch when it's cheaper or reserve this place for a special occasion dinner.  I really love the salad here, and try the fried zucchini as an appetizer.  Seafood ala Rico, the Virginia spots, and the scallops have always been good.",

The atmosphere is like walking into Goodfellas. Don greeted us at the podium and literally became a friend by the end of the night.  The food is out of this world!!  We had the ceasar salad for two ( which is tableside created by Don of course) ..best I've ever had.  I had the Walleye stuffed with crab meat and hubby had the lamb chops.  Unreal.  Their wine selection is on an IPAD, which is a cool way to look at their huge selection.  At the end, Don gave us a tour of the restaurant.  We felt like real VIP's there.  I can't want to come back with our friends and family.  Thanks Don!!",

Service very poor and slow even though we were one of three tables. Food was just okay. My husband had strip steak. Chewy and not well seasoned. Brussels sprouts were frozen and steamed - no seasoning.   My seafood dish was hot but not even on par with Olive Garden. Bread was cold and stale.   No attention given to presentation. Overall - overpriced and disappointing. Too bad because my husband was checking it out as a corporate dinner location.",

From the moment that we pulled in the driveway, everything about this place makes you wonder if Tony Soprano is going to walk around the corner. Most of the cars in the parking lot are Cadillac, the host knows most of the customers by name and most of the dishes are traditional Italian dishes. The food is delicious and you don't have to worry that the chef has a new interpretation of chicken piccata. They do traditional Italian really good. If you used to go to the Primadonna on a regular basis, this place makes you feel the same exact way. However, this place is not infant friendly. They have booster seats but no highchairs. The prices are also good, just a little more than chain restaurants but so much more delicious. As soon as my kid can sit in a booster, we will be here on a regular basis.",

The potatoes were just yummy and great vegetable medley. and the Biscuit Tortoni!   David, one of the owners helped us in our time of great need, for that we will be forever grateful. (Ask him how he went above and beyond for us,  what a guy!)  As newcomers, it is so nice to find and support a family owned restaurant, especially one that has been so successful all these years.

    "text": "I love old school, nostalgic restaurants.  In fact, I get a little teary-eyed when I walk into places like Rico's because it reminds me of having dinner with my Dad.  My fiance and I started off with a drink in the bar since it was Valentine's Day.  Bar service was slow in terms of acknowledging us at the bar as well as bringing us our drinks.  There were only 2 other people seated at the bar.  We were seated for dinner.  Service was very attentive--probably the highlight of the night aside from my glass of Nebbiolo.  We opted for table side Caesar to start.  Hellloooo garlic.  Yowza.  I love a good Caesar but I still tasted the garlic 7 hours later when I brushed my teeth.  We ordered the Roquefort filet and the Chicken Piccata.  The filet was good, not great.  The Chicken Piccata was the most disappointing thing I have ordered in a restaurant in years, and I LOVE chicken Piccata.  The chicken is poached and STARK WHITE in color.  Not appetizing-looking at all and it was extremely bland.  Had the capers not been on the plate it would have had no taste at all.  The saddest part was 1/3 of my fiance's baked potato had a huge black section on it.  He grew up on a farm, and he recognized it as a big block of mold in the potato.  How could that happen?  The side of pasta with pink sauce was just okay.  In all, we were very disappointed in our experience at Rico's and it pains me to say that because we were so looking forward to having an old school, special dinner together.  Major bummer.  Valet parking was excellent.",

I really liked the house salad dressing which is a flavorful Italian that isn't over-powered with garlic or vinegar.  The tiramisu and carrot cake were good too.  The waitress, Diane, was terrific.

I definitely could not have done it without the guidance and expertise from David!  He was able to find just the right wine for the banquet, talk me through an delicious, but not over the top menu and work with me on keeping my costs down without \"cheeping out\" on anything.  Every team member was so professional, kind and made an effort to be invisible.  Once I walked in and the banquet started, everything was handled without my guidance and I was able to enjoy!  The food - Oh!  Appetizers were fabulous.  My favorite was the Zucchini Fritti - so light!  Some in my party commented that the Filet was the best they ever had.  My Eggplant Parm was amazing and HUGE!  As well the Caprice salad was fresh and sizable.   Thanks Rico's, David and the entire team for sending my Mom out with the party she deserved!",

They have the Pittsburgh zucchini appetizer - I've never seen it anywhere else - of zucchini cut length-wise, very thin, lightly battered and fried, and it's perfect with just a little bit of lemon (although my mom and dad like it with marinara sauce and grated Parmesan cheese). The calamari are just as good and I dare you to eat just one!  Pastas are great, and classic - alfredos, marinara, tomato basil, and pink sauces, all of which are wonderful. Rico's has amazing seafood - strange for a restaurant so far from the ocean, but I would put the softshell crabs I've had here up against any I've ever had. Chicken and veal are also great here.  The one negative (and this is True of many otherwise wonderful Pittsburgh restaurants) is the quality of the dessert. Most Pittsburgh restaurants haven't bought into the idea of a pastry chef, and Rico's is no different. Skip the frozen Mississippi mud cake, cheesecake, and tiramisu, and head to Squirrel Hill (or home) for dessert.",

    "text": "Also visited with a different group of 13 on New Years Eve 2013. Stopped in my tracks when I saw the menu prices even after having recently returned from a week of eating the signature restaurants in Walt Di$ney World.  Service was slooooowwww. Reservation were for 7:30. Sat down at 8:00. Received menus at 8:30. Appetizer order taken for two people at one end of the table at about 9:00 but the rest of the table was ignored. Entree order taken about 9:30. Food arrived after 10:30. Ouch.  Waitress said there were 3 stuffed peppers on the appetizer plate so we order two of them to cover the six of us wanting one. When they arrived about an hour later there were two per order and this was explained that the kitchen changes things at whim. Waitresses were generally not pleasant.  The food was generally fine, but by no means worth $32-$58 per entree for ONLY the protein and one side (vegetable or potato), and nothing special. Baked potatoes were undercooked. The so-called 'supreme salad' was an up charge for a small house salad with a slice of cucumber, one olive, an one tomato wedge. The least expensive entree was a $31.95 pasta dish.  To be fair, my $35 cajun swordfish was nicely cooked and seasoned.  The owner/manager was everywhere trying to placate what appeared to be generally unhappy patrons. While we waiting for our table we overhead the manager confront more than a few patrons leaving in the lobby asking why they left such small tips--after our experience we knew the answer to the question.  Wine prices were steep (typically $13-15 a glass) and soft drinks ($2.50) each included only one re-fill. The table bread was generic rolls.  Not impressed at all. Sky-high prices for middling food and mediocre service. I would avoid this place. For about half the prices consider nearby Mediterraneo or for a True splurge there are better options.",

It's definitely \"old school\" with the average customer twice my age, but I liked it.  I first visited this place about ten years ago when I was starting my career and I remember the veteran guys I was with having dirty martini's with there five course lunches.  I remember at that time thinking \"I'm gonna love this career\".  They have probably the best ceasar salad in town prepared tableside.  Last night we only had a few appetizers at the bar, but they were very good.  The food begins with a nice selection of bread.  It was nothing special, but good quality.  We sampled the crab hoezel (sp?).  This was several large chunks of lump crabmeat with lemon and butter.  The price was very reasonable ($14.50) for the large amount of crabmeat.  We all enjoyed very much.  We also tried a calamari and sausage appetizer.  This was surprisingly good.  It was not fried and it was served with a delicious red sauce.  I was really impressed with this traditional appetizer.  We also had the fried zucchini which was lightly fried and quite good with a little red sauce and a bit of parmasan.  The bartender was really good and professional. One of the things I like about this place is that the staff are pro's and not just college kids working until they find something else to do.  I probably should give this place four stars, but it really is in need of a remodeling of the interior.  The interior probably is the same as when the doors opened 30+ years ago.  The owners son also came over and visited with us.  He was really nice and certainly made you feel at home.  This is a good place.  Take your parents. \"",

And she wrote in the total as well.  This makes a big difference when the prices are higher.  Was it just this waitress or is this policy at this restaurant now?",

    "text": "Long story short: Save yourself the trip.  It is overpriced canned and fried food served by a wait staff that is completely ill prepared to do much of anything. It took 3 separate visits by the waiter just to get a drink order - incompetence epitomized. Moreover, there was a severe language barrier between our server and our table. Oh and the table was very wobbly, which just pissed me off. Finally, they force your car to be valeted and incessantly ask you to check your coat. I can only imagine why this is done, if only to extract more money from patrons.  The height of the evening was when a third party, apparently a worker from the kitchen (for all we know this could have been another patron), spent over 10 minutes mixing a Caesar Salad adjacent to the table. Not only did the process resemble and sound like the mixing of cement in a truck, we were surprised to find human hair amongst the lettuce. In reflection of the night, I have come to realize this is likely par for the course at Rico's.  The price of Rico's is also an issue. One of our party had the salmon, which was prepared and tasted as though it was caught directly out of the Monogahela earlier in the day. $30 for disgusting and gamey fish? No thanks. Furthermore, our server assured us that the side \"of beans are wonderful this evening.\" This is interesting as it was without doubt the beans themselves came directly from a pre-packaged can of vegetables. $4.50. Finally, Rico's insists upon serving Caesar Salad in increments of 2, outlawing the ability to share the salad with 3 or more people from a common dish that sits tableside. This is just very confusing.  I give Rico's 1 star on Yelp because there is no way to grade a restaurant any lower. Our experience was overall terrible and with luck we will never return.",

If you are not splitting the check your be charged an automatic 20 percent tip, no one should ever determine how much you pay for a tip unless your in a large party. This I found to be ridiculous. Also you must use the valet parking for dinner and there is no reason why you need to when there is a large parking lot.",

Rico's is a classic Italian restaurant with very high-quality ingredients, expertly prepared.  Do try the zucchini -paper thin, crisp and hot, they are delightful with lemon and Parmesan cheese.  I had the delicious veal piccata and it was perfectly cooked, tender and satisfying. My wife enjoyed the Pittsburgh fillet, charred on the outside and near raw inside. No bother !  Our wonderful server took it back and had them prepare it medium rare. Word to the wise unless you want a raw fillet, do  go with medium rare.   We won't go here every night, but wow was it wonderful! A great place for a special occasion or a wonderfully old-fashioned, high quality Italian meal.",

The zucchini appetizer the best zucchini I've eaten in a restaurant, thin thin slices crisp & cleanly fried. Table side Caesar a fine show and tasty. Can't escape the classy, nostalgia of the place. the excellent open architecture. Angel hair with creamy garlic, pine nuts & crab. Wide noodles with white sauce & huge scallops.

    "text": "This was the first time my fiancee and I dined at Rico's (Friday, 3 November 2017).  The offering of only valet parking is a drawback for me and something which I do not like. The patron gets off to a great start with the welcome that is received from the distinguished gentleman host. The restaurant is enormous, attractive, comfortable, and elegant. The standout of the entire staff is host Lisa Rose, who immediately caused us to feel that we were with a friend.  She is a dynamo: charming, gracious, friendly, smiling, and ingratiating, one of the finest people I have encountered in the hospitality industry.  The restaurant is elegant and comfortable.  The policy of not taking reservations was not a problem, given the large seating capacity. We were seated immediately. Unfortunately, we were placed between two loud parties, including one with about eight guests whose members had no idea that their talking over each other could be heard throughout the restaurant.  Our server, Francis, has an accent, rendering him not easy to understand, but he is a consummate professional: gracious, pleasant, attentive, and knowledgeable.  Our food was delicious.  We were taken aback by the high prices and the fact that dinners do not include side dishes or salad.  The gentleman who prepares salads tableside was loud and was overheard talking about menopause and diapers as he prepared a salad for the loud couple next to us.  Our fried zucchini, veal parmigiana, and pasta rotolo were delicious and portions standard size. Our glasses of wine were enjoyable, but tiny for the $8 price. We were not bowled over by the bread and roll selection and these should be served warm in a restaurant of this stature: they were not. Soft whipped butter would be more appealing than hard pats of it.  We were taken aback by the high prices, significantly greater than two of our favorites for this type of cuisine: Scoglio and Franco's Trattoria.  I dine at a wide variety of fine restaurants.  I have never before encountered one which charges $4.50 for blue cheese or gorogonzola dressing, more than twice the price of the salad when ordered with a dinner.  I realize how fortunate I am to have Franco's in my community, where I can make a reservation and for $17 receive a huge portion of delicious chicken parmigiana, large bowl of chicken pastina soup, large side dish of daily changing chef-inspired mashed potatoes or pasta, and an assortment of Breadworks products served with whipped butter.  Additionally, Franco's offers many opportunities throughout the year for 10% off or more when one purchases gift cards: unbeatable.  As we departed, I stopped at the host stand to tell Lisa Rose to tell her how enjoyable she made the evening for us and how wonderful she is: she was deeply touched.  She walked out to the foyer with us and told us how we had made her day.  She asked my fiancee her name and hugged her.  She left us glowing.",

The only thing that was actually good was the fried zuchinni.  The batter was PERFECT.  I ordered a steak that rivaled the cost of a good steakhouse.  It was bland.  It was cooked properly but I have had better steaks from a local grocer for $9.  The veggies for both meals weren't nearly as good as steam in bag frozen.  Our rolls were cold and hard, as was the butter.  My wife's meal was quite good unless you count appearance.  I have seen diners with better presentation.  At many points throughout the meal we caught wiffs of what smelled like someone smoking indoors.  I contacted Rico's two different ways and have not gotten a response.  Frankly the place wouldn't be worth the time for a free meal if they were concerned about this review.  There are much better places for a lot less in the area.  Still no reply despite another attempt to see if our poor experience was a fluke.",

Really, that's too bad, because if the atmosphere matched up with the surroundings, it'd make a nice restaurant with a good reputation even better.  We started with the zucchini - yes, you've got to have it if you go to Rico's!  For my main plate, I had a special, swordfish, with spinach on the side - the markup for the spinach side was insane -- another $7?  That's like a whole box of spinach at Restaurant Depot!  And with the prices, the fact that salad is not included borders on unacceptable.  I had creme caramel for dessert - which was not very good, also outdated, and saturated with caramel like someone had too much fun with their squeeze bottle back in the kitchen.  Service was very attentive, even as it filled up over the course of the evening - I'd either show up kind of early or make reservations to make sure to get a table with views of the trees and not the internal room with no views.  Overall, I think that Rico's is coasting on its reputation instead of doing anything innovative, creative or interesting.  Updated food with slightly more reasonable prices would make me go back, and keep coming back, but for the time being, I wouldn't.",

Chef Rico uses fresh quality ingredients prepared simply just the way I like... his seafood is fresh, Veal is tender (try the medallions) and the angel hair pasta with pignoli nuts is lite and simply fantastic!   The place is a throwback to the old days of great service and food, where they know you by name and care about every customer.",

The bar is classic with an extensive wine list. Try the filet, Caesar salad, stuffed banana peppers and tiramisu.   You won't be disappointed with this classic establishment.",

We had a party of 12 served by two waitresses who couldn't seem to get their act together. They were rude and made several mistakes with our orders. The whole wait staff were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. David, the owner, verbally scolded a young bus boy in the middle of the dining room in front of all of the guests. To top it off, they charged $33 to cut our cake into 12 pieces! Yes you read that correctly...$33 cake cutting charge! Again, David the owner, was not only unapologetic about the service and the charges but he was actually indignant. He stated \"your party of 12 was served in 2.5 hours by two waitresses, what's the problem\".  Well David maybe YOU are the problem!",

Is the food the most hipster modern? Nope, but it is old school, elegant DELICIOUS fine dining. The staff is exemplary, especially the pillars of the restaurant Lisa Rose & David. Everyone is friendly & accommodating. Their seafood and tiramisu is worth an hour + drive. This will continue to be our big night out (and chill Thursday evening) spot. :-)",

    "text": "We took our three sons all in early 20's. I was taken by surprise when the owner leaned over my son's shoulder telling him that he needed to twist the pepper grinder after seeing him shake it. What the owner hadn't seen was my son had already twisted the grinder and was just shaking the loose pepper off before setting it back on the table. This was an embarrassing comment to make at a table full of people regardless if someone was having difficulty. We have a pepper grinder at home and know how to use it. Needless to say we won't be back along with my three professional sons whom all have begun their professional careers!  And the service was absolutely horrible!   The waitresses were annoyed by us also.  Reason? Because they had been there for years and are not appreciative of their jobs!  Never again!!!!",

    "text": "Update:  Unfortunately, I had to return due to family obligations.  I had hopes that maybe, this year would be different.  I could literally copy and paste my review from last year.  We had the same miserable server and the same issues were had.  My favorite part of the evening is when she brought us 3 orders (which aren't cheap) of escargot and when we told her we didn't order it, she proceeded to argue with us.  She informed us that we had to have ordered it since she \"wrote it down\".  Another favorite was when, in the middle of taking our table's orders, she abruptly left.  We didn't know where she went until we saw her bringing salads to an adjacent table.  What?  Again, the food is too expensive to maintain staff on the payroll that clearly don't give a care about service quality.  I pray that I'm not stuck coming back here next Christmas.    My family and I made reservations here for Christmas Eve.  I have worked many holidays and can appreciate that it can be challenging to be \"all in\" when others are able to be at home.  With that being said, it helps nothing to be miserable and acting as if engaging with customers is a huge burden.  Any questions that we asked of our waitress was met with attitude.  Someone in our party asked if they served an item and her response was \"you'll have to look at the menu\".  Upon arrival of our meals, someone in my group received something that he didn't order.  The waitress proceeded to argue with him about it to the point that he just went with it.  For a more expensive restaurant, I would have definitely expected a better quality of service.  I will not be returning.",

    "text": "This was our first time at Ricos - it was a delightful experience! The restaurant feels like it's on top of a mountain and in a strange location, but once you get up the hill, your met with a private parking area and the valet!   The restaurant is very large and classy with multiple rooms. The greeters are kind and professional taking your coat and escorting you to your table. There is a bar area and fine dining areas. The waitress we had was kind and prompt but not as helpful as I would have liked in choosing a meal. Other waitresses seemed more talkative and explanatory with the nearby guests. The ambience is very nice - calm, comfortable, and romantic. It definitely reminded me if an old school Italian joint.  The menu is pretty diverse with plenty of options - it changes daily. Remember it's an Italian steakhouse, so the options reflect. My wife got the broiled seafood platter (fish, shrimp, clams, oysters, scallops) that was coated in bread crumbs and butter, a side salad, and Brussels sprouts and I got the 12oz peppercorn steak with sauteed hot peppers in tomato sauce, a twice baked potato, and side salad. My wife enjoyed her dish and I thought it was tasty too. My steak was tasty, but was a little more done that I requested (I asked for med.). The sauteed hot peppers were outstanding - very spicy. The twice baked potato was very dry - I had to add my own butter. I ended up dipping it in the steak juices... Bread was brought out before our meals, but it was hard and so was the butter - it was average. The salad was great.  We each got coffee and dessert, wife had creme Brule and I had the chocolate fudge cake - creme Brule and coffee was just ok, the cake awesome.  All in all my wife and I were pleased with the taste, quality, and portions of our meals for the price ($2 for a side salad that was larger than expected and tasty!). I'd say this place is less pricey than other similar \"fancy\" restaurant without sacrificing quality - all that food for $108. I definitely recommend Ricos and plan to go back.",

    "text": "A Justifiable Rave Review to Whet Your Appetite @ Rico's Gangbusters Italian Restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA According to others I'm someone considered relatively a gourmet rather than a gourmand, and invariably one who carefully discerns the number and types of restaurants most worthy of a personal review, e.g., on Yelp, TripAdvisor and Facebook.  Justifiable kudos and two thumbs way-way-up, therefore, extend to the entire graciously customer-oriented and very professional staff at Rico's restaurant an iconic fine Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Why? My spouse and I and our immediate family had the distinct pleasure of dining at venerable Rico's on Christmas Eve. [12-24-2017] My first visit to Rico's was a considerable number of years ago, and this was my spouse's first memorable treat.  Whether you're a native Penguins, Pirates or Steelers fan, or a first-time visitor to Pittsburgh, therefore, please make it a point to treat yourself to dine and imbibe at Rico's restaurant because we feel confident you'll be pleasantly satisfied and pleasurably satiated with Rico's scrumptious restaurant fare and thirst-quenching libations. During dinner hours after you drop-off your vehicle with the attentive valet parking attendants as you enter the vestibule at Rico's there's a panoply of photos on the walls replete with numerous prior Rico's diners who are/were celebrities or sports stars an added substantiating testament to the popularity and successful longevity of Rico's.   For your added convenience often there's also a cloak room attendant greeting you very invitingly with an infectious smile just to your right after you enter the restaurant.  Our entire party was greeted most warmly by Mr. David Lorenzini, plus Don, Rico's affable and proficient Maitre d, and Tiffany one of Rico's very charming baristas who pleasantly prepared Christmas Mimosas for most of us.  Shortly thereafter we were promptly seated.  After exchanging pleasantries with our delightful and very proficient and professional server Dede and Don, we initiated our dinner with memorable appetizers consisting primarily of escargot and lump crabmeat Hoelzel accompanied by plentiful warm rolls and butter.  Next, we all thoroughly relished very thinly-sliced fried zucchini squash sliced lengthwise accompanied by tantalizing marinara sauce served on the side.  Afterwards, we had a memorable Caesar salad that Don deftly prepared from scratch table side with his usual utmost pizzazz and aplomb, My spouse savored a delicious swordfish steak with garlic butter and capers sauce, plus I chose a generous portion of plump sea scallops a la Rico topped with garlic butter and bread crumbs all perfectly cooked scrumptiously to perfection. We each also had a mouth-watering side of Rico's signature creamed angel hair garnished with pignoli nuts plus spinach. Throughout our meal we imbibed very delicious Cabernet Sauvignon wine.  Just prior to our ordering desert, attractive and very personable Lisa Rose an integral key member of Rico's very customer-oriented staff also stopped by our table to say hello and to wish us a very Merry Christmas too.  For dessert we had delicious classic pecan balls with hot fudge and caramel and a moist carrot cake. Bottom line:  Please make it a point to visit Rico's whenever you're in Pittsburgh.  Predicated upon our thoroughly delightful dining experience we respectfully believe you'll agree you'll not only be captivated with your dining experience but Rico's surely will also exceed your most discriminating expectations.  Each and every member of Rico's staff makes you feel as if you're the most important person in the restaurant. Fred Harden III  San Diego, California P.S.  Constructive suggestions/comments for patrons of Rico's:  Rico's normal business hours are 11:00 a.m. to 10 p.m. six (6)  days per week except Rico's is closed on Sundays, [Open Mother's Day] On festive holidays such as Christmas Eve, however, Rico's is (officially) open from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Last year on Christmas Eve it was very crowded during the evening; thus, this year our party opted to dine earlier commencing around 4:45 p.m.  Accordingly, to facilitate a win-win situation for both Rico's patrons and Rico's entire dedicated staff who certainly are also entitled to spend some quality time on Christmas Eve and other festive holidays too with their friends and families, patrons of Rico's may want to opt to dine earlier than usual to ensure that everything runs smoothly because when we exited Rico's around 7 p.m., e.g., there was still a throng of people waiting to be seated for dinner. In all probability, therefore, many of Rico's Christmas Eve patrons finished their meals later than 8 p.m. While Rico's caters to all groups, the core clientele especially during holidays is predominantly gentrified so proverbially \"When in Rome do as the Romans do,\" and while it isn't absolutely necessary to dress to the nines dress comfortably yet appropriately.",
