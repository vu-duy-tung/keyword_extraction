    "text": "Wow!  What happened to this place!  It used to be a great place to go to to enjoy a really good fresh fish meal.  Not any more!  I have 2 reviews.  1) My Dad and I recently went for lunch on a Thursday.  There were maybe 10 groups in the whole restaurant.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant.  It was stinky, & hot.  No air circulation at all.  We told our waitress, they did try to solve that problem by turning down the air conditioning.    It was almost comfortable by the time we left.  I had to call our waitress over from another part of the restaurant to place our order after a 15 minute wait after that.   As for our food, really just mediocre at best.  I always order iced tea for lunch, it tasted old.  The cobb salad was really just chopped fish in a mayonaise mess served over lettuce. I ddn't expect mayonaise!  My fathers gumbo was good, he was satisfied.  Waitress was nice, just unattentive.   Also, kitchen and restaurant were very noisey.  Dishes breaking, things dropping right next to us at least twice, no appoligies for noise.   2)This past Sunday my husband wanted to go to sit at the bar and grab a quick meal, which is something we often did on a weekend night with no hesitation.  I strongly tried to persuade him to go elsewhere after my last experience with my Dad.   We love when Terrie is working there, she gives great service and is great to talk to.   She was not there this Sunday.  Our bartender was really unattentive and seemed bored to be there.  Never talks to you, short quick answers.  The restaurant was not very crowded, we got a seat at the bar right away, it was early also, before six.  It started to fill up as we were sitting there.  Maybe six more people came while we were there.  Bar was still more than half empty.  It took a long time to get our drinks (15 minutes), and a long time to get our order in, (20 more minutes) and a long time to get our food (25/30 minutes).   The bartender spent a lot of time talking to other employees with her back to us.  My husbands shrimp tasted fishy, salad tasted old.  My salmon was just ok, nothing special, not bad though.  All in all, It used to be a great place to go to for a nice meal.  Now its too pricey for just mediocre food and mediocre service.  We will definitely go elsewhere.  Mitchells has gotten old and tired!!",

The bartender took our order and waited on us. Although it seemed she worked here for a long time, she was very flustered and got our order wrong. She even forget our drinks at one point and we had to remind her. The bar area was not very crowded and we noticed that she made the same mistakes with other patrons. Not sure what the problem was  Decor..1 star.  As previously said we sat in bar to watch a football game. There are four tv's placed in very strange places with made it almost impossible to watch them. The tv's were old and needed updated.",

Seriously though, there's nothing better on a thirsty Thursday night than rolling into the bar area, scoping out a cozy, dark booth with my husband, ordering a strong martini and enjoying the evening.  The fish is always cooked to perfection, and the wait staff never minds if you have a special request.  Feel like eating healthy? Order your tuna steak blackened with a side of steamed asparagus (double up and forgo the starch). A great neighborhood stand by for the Lebo/South Hills area.",

    "text": "We went here for my Mother's birthday, and the experience was overwhelmingly--BAD! From the time I picked up the phone till the time we left, we dealt with a company that could care less about what garbage it puts out in the world.  I will start with the confusing reservation, we had a semi-large party (10), and it took about seven phone calls (I just counted from my call log) to actually get a reservation. After finally speaking to some \"party planner woman\", who when I finally got to speak with her went off on an anti-government tangent like the ramblings of a nutcase (any sane person would be ashamed). I actually had to ask the woman a second time to repeat her story so as to make sense of her crazy anti-government taxation narrative. After a second run with the story (I THINK) that she was blaming the government because we needed to pay a 3% charge on the room we reserved, and the tip could not be included because of the government.  It was literally the ramblings of craziness, I personally try to keep my politics out of making reservations. After that I almost cancelled, but being I live in New York I really did not have the knowledge to keep looking around for another place to have the birthday. We finally confirmed this reservation, but not without two messages being left on my phone by other staff members that sufficiently lacked phone skills. It sounded like a message left by an angry high schooler that was trying to bully me. The only person that I spoke to with any restaurant or phone skills was a man named Jay.   We got to the place and the one hostess made the only gesture of kindness from this entire experience; she took the cake that we had brought so that we were not standing there with it in front of the place. When we got to the room, it was called the \"captain's quarters\", and it smelled like a dirty mop. I asked the waitress to get us some candles to mask the smell, but of course she could not find any.   Our waitress was horrible, one of our party guests never got a refill on his drink, nor were others asked if they wanted more cocktails. She left appetizer plates on our table for way too long, even when our main dishes came up; YUP still have those appetizer plates sitting in front of me.   If you can get your waitress to help you at all you might order some very AVERAGE food. If you're into mid-grade nothing-special cocktails and food, then here you go, this is your place.   I was so upset as the night came to an end that I almost thought about leaving a below 15% tip (cause you know the government is going to take it all any way, so why even leave it--right?) But my good conscious said, no, you could leave 18%, and that was more than kind!",

He substituted fries for the potatoes, and received a small handful of fries.  Needless to say he was also still hungry.  His meal was also around 27.

    "text": "My wife and I dined here for the first time despite living nearby for more than thirteen years.  Our meals and dining experience were good, nothing extraordinary, nothing that grabbed us to want to return soon.  We were early for our reservation, but were seated right away.  It saddens me to see the slovenly attire of many of the diners, including a backwards baseball cap worn throughout the meal, at a fine restaurant like this.  We were not asked whether we wanted to dine outside, which would have been nice on this beautiful Easter late afternoon.  My wife ordered a gin martini that she is convinced was made with vodka.  I ordered a bottle of Penn Dark beer, which was predictable and good, full of flavor.  My iceberg wedge lettuce salad, $6.99, was delicious and a nice portion for one person.  It contained grape tomatoes, a tiny amount of tasty bacon chips, and the creamy bleu cheese dressing was ample and good.  My parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair pasta in garlic sauce, $16.99, was a nice portion: three chicken cutlets and a fair amount of pasta, but the dish was on the dry side.  The sauce was tasty, but scarce.  In an effort to keep from drenching the dish in liquid, the restaurant erred on the side of dry.  The description of the dish reminded me of Pollo Alla Italiano which was offered by Poli Restaurant, of blessed memory.  It was not nearly as good as the rendiition by Poli.  My wife's chef feature seafood at $22 was enjoyable and was served with a pyramid of seasoned rice.  The sourdough bread was served quite warm with softened butter:  very good.  The service was unobtrusive and fine.  The waiter tended to our needs.  For $62.31 for two plus tip, and this without one of the restaurant's $9.99 desserts, there are restaurants at which I would rather dine.",

We started w cup of Maine Lobster Bisque you could taste the lobster broth butter and cream& dry Sherry( Im a retired Sous Chef) it was better than bonefish's which tasted like tomato soup! Paid $5.96 a cup but worth it! My friend had Stuff shrimp w crab meat and six nice size shrimps w lump crab in it. And hers came w buttered smashed reds potatoes&?fresh Broccoli melody which were all fresh veggies seasoned right. She had extra take home. I had the Sam Adams seafood platter- just right for lunchtime. 2 pieces if beer battered cod was so fresh like they cut it off the fish.& 3 medium battered fried Shrimps tasted sweet fresh like shrimps do fresh& 2 diver dried scallops size of silver dollars- they brought us a fresh hot Bread loaf w softened butter! Mine was $14.95 hers was same plus 2 glasses Ice tea w Tip it was $50.00. But it was worth it! If you want fresh good seafood or fish you pay it! Im going back to try dinner menu! We really were full and couldn't have their Shark Fin pie desert! Really an enjoyable time w better co& food!",

We sat in the parking lot for a while waiting to ensure that we were dressed appropriately, but it was a Tuesday night so it was quiet, and we figured we would give it a go. Overall, the dress for the resturant is business causal, but there were several people sitting at tables in jeans.   Food was incredible! I had the salmon which is sushi grade salmon and melted in your mouth. My boyfriend had a platter with three different types of seafood in three different preparations... he said it was incredible. I was able to steal one of his Shang-hi Scallops which was perfectly cooked and the shang-hi sauce was a great salty balance to the sweet and savory scallops.  I was surprised none of our meals came with a starter salad, but only a small basket of bread... but to be honest, once our meals came we hardly noticed since the main dish was so large.  I just wish there was a location closer to DC.",

They have a sizable menu of fresh seafood with relatively creative recipes and multicultural inspiration. They also have great complimentary sourdough table bread. Food tends to be more buttery than necessary. My one major complaint is that their cocktails are TERRIBLE. For $10 a cocktail should not taste like a watered-down cheap mix drink. I ordered the \"pomegranate cosmopolitan\" and asked specifically for it to be \"not too sweet,\" and it came out tasting like daquiri mix and even had sugar around the rim.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriend went to Mitchell's for valentine's day dinner. We chose Mitchell's because it was close, we both like seafood, and we were easily able to get a reservation.  When we showed up at 7:00, there was a line to get in, which I figure is normal when everyone is making reservations for the same time. The line went quickly as everyone had a reservation and was promptly seated in the restaurant.  for some reason, me and my girlfriend were seated \"outside\" rather than in dining room or at the bar. I use quotes because outside in this context is basically in the middle of the mall. Couples before and after us were seated in dining area so I'm not sure why were had to sit in the mall. It felt weird because they seated us by the hostess station and there were people waiting in line to get in about two feet away from us. It was also a little strange to spend this much money on dinner while staring at the Panera from across the hall.   What I did like was that when I made my reservation, I told them I had a peanut allergy and the seating hostess was aware when she sat us without me needing to say anything. She told us she would tell our waiter for us. Just to be sure though, I told the waiter about my allergy and it seemed like he was hearing it for the first time. But maybe she just had not spoken with him yet. Our waiter was very nice and attentive.   I ordered the Shang Hai Sampler. It was pretty good. My girlfriend ordered the cod stuffed with lobster and shrimp. She loved it. We were given complimentary chocolates and also ordered creme brule and a cappuccino. My girlfriend loved the dessert but my cappuccino had no foam by the time it came so essentially it was a latte.  We will probably give this place another chance since the food was pretty good and we were given a coupon to come back. Otherwise this place is a little too expensive for the food. It is really too expensive if you are eating in the middle of a shopping mall.",

Was told by the girl out front \"we're running behind on our reservations, please take this pager and just hang out.\" --ok, I thought, it's New Year's Eve, I can understand the delay. However, while standing within 10 feet of the hostess podium I watch 2 parties (4 & 6 people) walk up immediately after me and get seated. One of which didn't even have reservations. I finally became vocal made a tiny fuss and was promptly seated. WTF?  Next, we are never given silverware until our main course comes. We're forced to eat our pan-seared ahi tuna with bare hands. Getting our drinks also took 20 minutes after ordering them. Ok, whatever, the Sam Adams winter ale I'm drinking makes me friendly and forgiving.  Next, 3 out of 4 from our party order lobster bisque, but all 4 are given lobster bisque. We're told no charge for that fourth bowl... Guess what happens? Yea, you guessed right.  Next, our main dishes are served. I ordered filet shrimp & scallops with asparagus. My main entree has 2 asparagus spears, two rather small shrimp accompanied by 2 nice ( the only thing \"nice\" during the entire evening) scallops, with a baked potato. My filet was ordered \"medium\" and was served not just rare, but RAW. When cut into, it was actually ice cold in the middle and close to the surface. Waiter apologizes, takes it back to the chef and brings my baked potato back to the table so \"I at least have something to eat\". Gee. Thanks. Steak comes back 20 minutes later, cold and untouched, like it sat there on the counter, nobody touched it, and it was brought back out to me. I refused to eat it, I became mean and was told \"let me see if I can just get this \"taken care of\". Thankfully, for the sake of a huge embarrassing scene they took the stupid crappy looking filet off of my bill. Boy, What a favor.   Verdict? Absolutely horrible service, lousy cold food (which would have made someone sick if they ate it) that was just thrown on a plate for a ridiculous price. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem paying for something in return. The only thing I got from Mitchell's was frustration and probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in quite some time. I can see this kind of stuff at Applebee's, but this is supposedly a True restaurant with ridiculously fresh fish and a great atmosphere. I should have used my darden restaurant gift card for dinner at Longhorn Steakhouse. At least I would have left having actually been able to FINISH my entree.  Avoid this glorified (and overpriced) Garfield's and goto McCormick and Shmick for fish, unless you like paying $145 for absolutely nothing.",

We all had wine and beer, and shared plates of calamari, ceviche, and crab cakes.  All were very fresh, and the dipping sauce for the calamari was awesome - something different from traditional marinara that had an Asian spin.  The crab cakes were full of fresh crab, and the ceviche was light and refreshing, served with plenty of chips.  Overall we were very pleased with the food and service, and even though my husband and I only dined here once, my parents visited three times during their stay in the area.

We had Cara as our waitress and she was just naturally pleasant, professional, and really skilled with people, from our 86 yr old dad to our 4 yr old.  The seats were comfortable and there was plenty of room for us to eat.   Let me start by saying they have the best clam chowder I've EVER tasted.   Our dishes ranged from perfectly cooked NY strips to bourbon salmon to the trio and everyone raved about their dinners.   We also got appetizers; everyone loved the civiche and the spicy crispy shrimp!  And desserts, the shark fin pie was delicious.    The only slight negative was the bread. It's sourdough and people in this area might not be used to how sour it is. That being said, it was fresh, hot, and crusty. I didn't care for it, but that's a personal taste issue. There's plenty of food without the bread.   I'd come back here in a heartbeat for another family dinner. Everything was fantastic and perfectly executed. :)",

I always order the same tilapia Shanghai style and this time the sauce was watery, the rice was undercook and the veggies were just nasty. So, the food is 1/2 bad...how about the place in general...? I was always impressed by the restrooms...oh...wow...mouth wash, great soap, and nice toiletries. Today, all gone, just a roll of brown paper remains. According to management \"customers\" do not need that. Even the mints and toothpicks are gone...and good luck finding a prompt hostess...as she is always on the phone taking care of take-outs. On the plus side, service is trying very hard to keep the standards.  If you want an overprice place with medium quality food that does not care for its customers....Mitchell Fish Market galleria is the place to go. Save your money and visit BRGR.  sorry guys....you are not special anymore....",

We waited quite awhile for our drink orders and some had to ask for water three times before it was delivered.  The salads were good but for the price the portions were a bit mediocre. Our dinners arrived and were not hot.  I had the salmon, scallop, shrimp soy ginger dish and all of my seafood was overcooked and cold and the rice was barely warm. Another at our table ordered scallops and they were cold and overcooked also. We were a party of 10 and everyone's dish was not hot. Our water glasses were never refilled. The restaurant was not very busy and I feel like they could have done a much better job on our food for the prices charged.",

    "text": "My friend suggested Mitchell's for our traditional New Year's eve dinner.  What a great idea I initially thought and we met there at 8:30 pm.  On our way to the booth in the corner where my friend and her husband were already seated I noticed that even though my shoes had some rubber-type treading on the bottom, the floor was slick with grease from the kitchen.  The constant traffic of servers through the kitchen across this section of flooring had created quite the build-up of grease on the floor.  I noted to myself to walk extremely carefully.  We safely arrived in the booth.  As we sat down we all discussed the slick floor before we turned our attention to the menu.  We had a good waiter who was attentive to our needs.  The food was good although honestly after what happened after dinner I can't even remember what I ordered.  For those of you who may think what happened next was caused by alcohol, let me state that I did order 1 moscow mule.  My friend and her husband had never had one and I wanted them to try it.  They each drank some of it and I sipped the remainder.  That was before dinner.  1 partial drink.  I did not get a chance to finish the drink before dinner came because the food was served promptly.  I intended to finish it after dinner.  When we had finished eating dinner and had ordered desert I decided to visit the ladies room.  I got up from the booth and carefully made my way taking literal baby steps across the slick section of floor to the restroom.  I finally made it and noticed that the floor in the restroom was not slippery at all.   As I left the restroom I walked first on the carpeted hallway section that runs front to rear.  As I took that first step back onto the grease-slicked tile section the edge of my heel slid and I could not control the fall that followed.  I hit my left hip and then broke the fall will my left cheekbone.  It was quite violent.  In order to hit my left side and the front of my face my body must have twisted as I fell.  I was initially stunned and could not get up.  The General Manager, Michael Shebeck, was apparently standing nearby as he was the first person I heard.  In that moment I was very angry.  I felt this was their responsibility to prevent this type of situation.  Simply cleaning the floor on a regular basis could have prevented my fall.  After I was raised to sit on a nearby chair, I showed him by sliding my shoes back and forth without any resistance how slick the floor was.  After limping back to the booth and applying ice to my cheekbone I sat there wondering if anything was broken.  (I subsequently went to the hospital and had my femur x-rayed and had a Ct scan to my face and neck.  Nothing was broken. Though, I have Physical Therapy twice a week to address the problems caused to my joints by such a violent fall on concrete.)  Honestly, when the check came I thought just maybe that they might comp my meal or the whole check.  That did not happen.  I guess that would have been some type of indication that they took ownership of what happened.  We paid our $111.38 check (for the 2 of us) plus tipped our waiter. Several weeks later I got a call from Landry's the parent company (Tony Lazenby, Risk Assessment Department).  She asked for my 'side of the story'.  At the end of the call she said she would get back with me after she finished her investigation.  Weeks went by and Tony would not return my phone calls.  Finally she did.  'Landry's would not be offering any compensation', she stated flatly.  They would not cover hospital bills or physical therapy costs. NOTHING!  When I asked why, she told me that the investigation is confidential and she could not tell me anything further.  I did receive a letter in the mail stating that they were 'unable to establish any negligence on their part'. Hmmmm.  Apparently, a dangerous, grease-slicked floor, easily preventable by regular cleaning did not constitute negligence.  I wish I knew what Mr. Shebeck had told his corporate office.  Please be careful at this location and at the location in the Waterfront.  My friend tells me that the floor there is also not cared for properly and it just as slick. In fact, try Bonefish Grill or anywhere else where the safety of the consumer is important.",

    "text": "Indifferent service (server forgot my beer order and dining room was not crowded at 6 pm) and food, while claimed to be \"fresh\", tastes the same as Red Lobster - just much smaller portions at higher prices. (You will never need to order a doggie bag at Mitchell's.) And they have raised drink prices again - $15 for a watered down cocktail after tax + tips.  That said, happy hour at the bar remains a pretty good deal. Otherwise, mediocre in most respects. Yes, this is my 1st Yelp review - but I'm a real person who lives in the neighborhood and have visited this establishment about a dozen times in the past 5 years. As I said, I like their Happy Hour proposition - so I'm never disappointed if I stick to that fairly low bar.",

I ordered the trip with a small piece of salmon, 6 shrimp, and a crab cake. It came with a vegetable side. The salmon was great and well prepared. The crab cake was ok. The shrimp, however, were a little rubbery and dry. For 30 dollars, I probably wouldn't get that again. I would, however, try something else here. My family members got steak and all of them were cooked perfectly. They were all very satisfied with their desserts as well, which were shareable!",

With a fabulous hey-I-just-caught-this-ahi-let's-cook-this-up mentality. When I moved in the dead of winter, I wanted fish like in Hawaii. Whatdoyouknow, they had ahi from Hawaii. Let me just set up my tent and live in this restaurant! Fantastic preparations, fabulous sides and seafood flown in from Hawaii. Served up by great bartenders and waiters and I'm sold.   I have been going there at least every 2 weeks since February. Now they have wahoo from Hawaii on the menu. There is a word in Hawaiian for delicious, it's ono. Ono is also the name used for wahoo. Seriously delicious. If you can, go to Mitchell's for any fresh fish, but make sure to try the ono-I mean wahoo. All the fresh fish is amazingly ono!!!",

    "text": "Great Experience!  Was looking for seafood dinner - haven't been to Mitchell's for years - and only visited the Waterfront location in the past.  We really weren't impressed with that location enough to go ever back again.    We went early for happy hour and were impressed with the drink and appetizers offered!  I love the moscato sangria!  yummm!  Also Calamari was fantastic and my husband loved the fresh oysters (not on a special, but delicious!)    We stayed for dinner, ate at a hightop in the bar area - service was EXCELLENT!  (Jae)  We tried New England Chowder & Lobster Bisque - enjoyed them both with the warm bread they offered.  Husband had pan seared scallops (cooked perfect) - I had the Shang Hai Combo - also enjoyed.   Can't say anything negative about this experience and we are pretty tough on restaurants.    Also- being in the business - we noticed something that impressed us too.  A server broke a glass by the bar, shattered everywhere - This happens a lot.  You should remove all the glassware that in close range and re-wash.  Most places won't do  that honestly, especially during a busy happy hour at the bar.  BUT, they did - we watched as someone carefully took all the glasses out and had them washed.  Great job Mitchells.  Clearly they have a GM who knows what's up here.   We love how close this location is to our home and will continue to go here!  They have a new regular customer.  Thanks for a great experience.",

We ordered a few drinks which were good. We then ordered dinner. The waitress took or order but did not deliver any of the meals.  The person who brought the food to our table just set it down and o handed it out to the two others in our party.  I ordered a lobster bisque and it was all cream. Which was very good but there was not one piece of lobster in it.  I asked the waitress why there was no pieces of lobster and she said because sometimes that's how it is. So I just ate it.  Then one of my friends ordered a salad. The salad looked great.  But as he was eating it he pulled a long piece of hair out of his mouth. Well that totally grossed everyone out at the table.  I asked for the manager and he said well the kitchen is clean not sure where that came from.  He did not really give an apology.  We ordered a few more drinks after that.  Our bill total was $95 and the manager did take the salad off of the bill.  My question is how could I have spent $95 and received the worst meal and worst service ever?   I won't be returning.  Too bad because every meal I have had there prior was really good.  Mitchell's won't see me eating there ever again.",

The food was good - some better than others - and there was a ton of it! Shrimp and oysters were fresh and the seafood tower was awesome. Deviled eggs, crab cakes, sliders, spinach dip and sesame beef were delish. Could have done without the crudites and cheese platters as well as the fried calamari.   Overall I would highly recommend Mitchell's if you're hosting an event in the South Hills.   Great job guys!",

Restaurant is attached to some kind of shopping plaza but didn't even realize till halfway through the meal.   Food was AMAZING!!!!  Served hot and fresh and at daily market prices (this is a treat for us) a little bit more expensive then your normal TGIF & Applebee's.   We ordered :   Two cold water lobsters served with smashed red potatoes and asparagus.  DELICIOUS and appropriate serving amount to fill you but not overstuff you. You get a personal butter warmer which is cute and a nice little detailed touch.   Mega Sizzling seafood combo which included : king crab legs/mussels/clams/shrimp/ potato wedges - served on a huge sizzling platter (food was grilled and lightly seasoned) at $58 a platter it was awesome to be served food not drowned in seasoning and butter !!!   Our waitress was a gem and very accommodating! We will most definitely come back!!!   ***only downside is where we were sitting - near the kitchen /take out area and all we could head under the candlelight glow was most of the young staff complaining/dropping/ and talking about things I wish not to hear if I'm spending $150 for dinner *** sit somewhere near a window or away from the kitchen area ***",

Bisque was good.  Gumbo was pathetically just rice & sauce.   We love mussels and were looking forward to our order.  They looked good and were tasty but had no broth to go with it.   We like to dip the bread in the broth. So we requested more broth.  It came out right away and the waitress dumped it all over the mussels.   It was straight up salt.   Made the mussels completely inedible.   After the disappointing 2nd round of drinks, the disappointing gumbo and disappointing salad, we were just done.    $83 hard earned dollars down the drain.

    "text": "The ginormous carrot cake. That's what comes to mind when I think of Mitchell's. It's huge. Split it between 4 people. If you like normal carrot cake though, this may not be for you, since it's particularly sweet and moist and tastes like actual cake, instead of y'know.. healthy. Instead of like carrots. 90% of my trips here have been just to split this slice of cake among several people. You MUST end your dinner with this, especially if you don't normally consider yourself a fan of carrot cake.  I have eaten here a couple of times outside of that, as well as other Mitchell's locations over the years. I will say that the restaurants are pretty consistent across that board as far as I've seen in terms of execution and friendly service (with the exception of one server here who I believe I saw still working here last week somehow - but it's good enough chances to be worth taking). It's nice to have a decently good chain to rely on if there's nothing else that strikes your fancy in a new city or middle of nowhere somewhere.  The seafood here is pretty good - always cooked well, fresh, and seasoned properly, but some entree portions I've seen are on the small side, and it's not very consistent across the menu. But again, there's good service from waiters who can probably make a good recommendation in terms of size.  If the seafood craving strikes on a tight budget, happy hour is a great deal. I believe it's weekdays 5-7pm here. Can stuff self for as low as $6 (ie 2 decently sized tacos + plate of fries) with pretty delicious food in the lounge/bar area, which is quite spacious and has comfortable booths along the wall.",

Can't go too wrong with a Landry's restaurant, right? I certainly recommend joining. It's $25 to join, however, you get $25 off your next bill, so it pays for itself.  Mitchell's has a wide selection on their menu. The spicy Asian shrimp appetizer is one of my favorites. For my entree, I usually opt for seabass. You can have it prepared several different ways. Their drinks are pretty decent too, but a little pricy. For dessert, the carrot cake is a must.  I love this location in the galleria. They have a little section where you can sit \"outside\" but not actually outdoors, it's in the mall. Employees are always friendly & the atmosphere in the bar area is nice. Be sure to make a reservation if you plan to go on a weekend as their is usually a wait. You can make one on opentable, which makes reserving a spot super easy. I haven't been to Mitchell's in a while but writing this review has me wanting to go back ASAP! Highly recommenced.",

I love Chilean sea bass and it's delicious here- I'd recommend preparing it simply grilled because it's so flavorful if there were any sauces on it - it would mask how delicious it is on it's own.  I love that Mitchell's is on open table so you can reserve a table quickly and easily.  They also are part of the Landry's group of restaurants (Mitchell's, grand concourse, joe's crab shack, McCormick and schmick and Morton's are all a part of it) and they have a rewards type program and on your birthday they give you $25 toward your meal!     Service is good, fresh seafood, nice wine list and close to my house -so a thumbs up!",

    "text": "My boyfriend INSISTED that we went to Mitchell's for our anniversary dinner and I couldn't argue it. I'm so glad we did.  We ordered SO much food. We started with some salads, he got the house salad, but he wasn't real fond of the dressing - it was like a ginger-y vinaigrette. Honestly I couldn't eat too much of it. I got the Ceasar salad which was delicious! Then we moved to an appetizer - mussels! First off, the size of this app is huge! Not too big that you can't eat afterwards, but definitely share with 1 or two people! The mussels were incredible and tasted so fresh! I also sipped from a strawberry mule, which had fresh strawberries in it - YUM!  Now, the entrees - I got the Shanghai Shrimp + Salmon + Sea Scallops and wow, I cannot emphasize enough how fresh the seafood tastes. It's such a difference! This dish was amazing! Has a little spice to it, but it's a large portion and you get the fantastic trio! I probably could've done without so much spinach piled under the salmon, but definitely not a deal breaker (eat your spinach kids!). My boyfriend got the swordfish of course! He finished his whole dish so that's all I have to say about that.  Previous to coming to Mitchell's, I was told to save room for dessert, or at least order it. GUYS, the sizes of these desserts! Dining in, we split a mini shark fin pie because we previously saw one go by which was full sized and I'm pretty sure it could feed a civilization! I had to take a piece of carrot cake home, which weighed about 50lbs! (Not really but it's the size of a mini cake!) Although these desserts sound terrifying, I highly recommend getting something to take!  I cannot wait for another excuse to go to Mitchell's. I do recommend reserving a table online or call ahead of time because it does get crowded. We reserved ahead of time, arrived, and were seating instantly. The service was great and it was just a really nice dinner.",

    "text": "I'm so glad Mitchell's participated in restaurant week. I'd never been to either location and we didn't know the location closer to us existed until Bryan noticed them on restaurant week.  The food was AMAZING. Bryan warned me to save room for the shark fin pie, thankfully. I don't eat dessert at restaurants often, but the shark fin pie is worth it!  I tried the gumbo and tuna bowl, which were both good. I loved my jambalaya and the asparagus took a while to get used to (a bit softer than I prefer), but it was good. The shark fin pie was beyond amazing, but I'd recommend getting the SMALLER portion unless you have a table of 4 or more. Splitting the big one with two people was too much. Delicious, but too much - even when I saved half my jambalaya for lunch.  The service was wonderful. Our waitress, Lisa, was so fast & stealthy that I didn't always realize she'd filled my water until I'd look down and see that it was full. The manager was also very friendly.  We'll definitely be repeat customers and look forward to many more delicious meals at Mitchell's. I wanted to try almost everything on the menu, so I'm sure I'll eat there many times before repeating a dish (other than getting the mini shark fin pie to share).",

Fish seems fresh and not over cooked, not dry, very tasty.   - My wife tried a seafood pasta that she liked very well. The calamari appetizer is great, too - lightly fried with just a little crispy batter.   - They've updated their menu and there's good variety here. Entries, soups, entree salads, and even some non-seafood pastas and sandwiches.   - SERVICE:  I'm seated quickly and the wait staff are good.   - SETTING:  It's a little bit worn; a little in need of a makeover, but it's not egregious.  It just feels a little 1998 in there.   My most recent visit (May, '18) was better than my previous, so I'll be back, and may add a star if it's really good again.",

I had the Shanghai salmon which is that one of my favorites it was prepared as I was used to at my first Mitchell's experience in Wisconsin many years ago. My husband have a broiled cod and enjoyed it as well. I topped off our dinner with a mini shark fin pie which is a delicious ice cream pie with an Oreo cookie crust.

Once we saw who we think was the manager, we requested a booth and he had mentioned that it wouldn't be an issue since there were plenty of seats available.   Once we were seated I had noticed that the table was dirty and I wiped it off in front of him. He then stated that he was sorry but they were still getting the tables cleaned off.....but did not clean it off for us in that moment.   Food was good however service was not.  We ordered the King Crab legs $45 and Dynamic Duo $35. We had a few questions for our waitress and she could care less as she walked away a few times in the midst of the question.  The king crab was provided with the right tools however the seafood cracker ended up breaking and our waitress was no where in sight to request a new one.  We grabbed another waiter as he passed and then he scurried around looking for another one.  Then he mentioned there were not any more and that they have been breaking.  I asked him how in the world are we going to break these crab legs opened..he then just apologized for not having anymore.  It took around 5 minutes for us to contact who again we think was the manager and then he found another set to use.  Also had to wait on getting another water for an unreasonable amount of time because again our waitress was no where in sight.  For the price of the items here - it is not worth the experience.  We definitely will not be back here.",

We had the Beets and Burrata as well as the Crispy Shrimp appetizers, soooo good!!!  For dinner, we all got fish, since hey it's Mitchell's Fish Market!!! Everything was amazing. Salmon, blackened cod, Swordfish Romesco - oh so yummy!  Couldn't even finish it, so lunch tomorrow. We did of course save room for Sharkfin Pie desert. Can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again and return to Mitchell's. Thanks to the staff for making our Thsnksgiving and great day!!",

    "text": "Went there with my family and the only one of us who liked their food was my nephew, who got a hamburger.  My fried fish was tasteless and my brother's lobster and shrimp stuffed cod was clearly frozen and microwaved...for $24.00.  He hated it.  My mom chose to have asparagus with her meal and got 3 or 4 shrivelled up over cooked pieces that were not edible.  She also had the fried fish and didn't like it.  Another at the table ordered chicken tacos and got fish, so he had to watch us eat our meals while he waited for the right order.  What a waste of $250.00 - for 6 of us.  They say that they serve fresh fish, but fail to mention the dishes that are microwaved, which is deceptive in my opinion, hence the 1 star review.  Probably won't go back.  I wish there were better choices in the South Hills.  These mediocre  restaurants stay busy because that is mostly what is available in the area.  If you decide to try it, be sure to ask what fish, if any, is fresh and cooked, not microwaved.",

    "text": "Updating my review of Mitchell's.   After my review I was contacted by 3 different members of Mitchell's management to tell my experience. They were very apologetic and said they would mail me gift certificates that I could use at any of their restaurant's since I did not live in the Pittsburgh area.    It has been over 2 months and I have not received them or any correspondence.    Apparently the problem with this chain goes higher than the local employees in Pittsburgh.",

Mixed vegetable  Bread fresh from the oven  Potatoes were red skinned mashed / The young lady who was the server  bright ,friendly great attitude . She kept refilling my empty glass with Diet Coke lots of ice it was a very hot day . The price was what I expected to pay for upscale sea food in a major US city. The gentleman's room neat clean . This is a place I plan to come again the music from the bar area was not real loud  but if you wanted to listen a person can enjoy it. The team leader at my table to make sure everything was to my satisfaction it was and paying was seamless , Thanks for having  maybe a Little REO Speedwagon  music would make it prefect so till next time. I am going to keep on loving you!",
