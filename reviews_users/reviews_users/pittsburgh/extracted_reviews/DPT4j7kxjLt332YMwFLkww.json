Dinner here can be a bit pricey, but if you go during the afternoon, the lunch menu is the way to go.  Prices are much lower, the selection is almost the same as dinner and portion sizes are still good.  Of course one of the best reasons for going here is to experience the meal preparations at the table.  It can become a fun performance, but they can vary depending on the chef assigned to you.  The food is usually excellent and the experience is great.",

Our 8:30 reservation was not met with any food until at least 9:30. Really crazy. However, it was made alllll better by our chef, Tito. When we go back and we *will* go back -- we will ask for Tito.  Is he Japanese? No, but he is awesome.   To apologize the manager did comp our entire meal... We were a party of 10 -- and we took good care of our servers...it really wasn't their fault. Happy Xmas eve Tito you know how to do it right. Thanks.",

The waitress  wasn't very good at explaining the menu, we then sat and waited at least a half hour before a chef arrived -only to tell us that he was taking another table and we're getting a new chef...the chicken was chewy and undercooked, and 2 people at our table didn't receive what they ordered. When it was time for checks the waitress became standoff - ish with us telling us that someone needed to pay for the food that wasn't received because she has nothing to do with the chefs. We requested the manager and explained that our chicken was undercooked. He actually ate the chicken off of a plate and told us it was fine! !!! At the end of it all, the waitress didn't even know her managers name and was bashing him to our party. Very unprofessional.  I won't eat there again, and will be sure to advise others to do the same",

So it may suprise some that locally two chains never failed to bring me back again and again. Benihana was one of them. Sometimes I ate there 4 or 5 times a month. Imagine my disappointment when twice I order my \"go to\" chicken and shrimp only to find shrimp is now colossal shrimp that had the consistency of shoe leather and mushrooms apparently don't apply. Service consisted of being scorned by an older Asian lady and told \"it will be a while\" to get my order corrected because they are busy! Then while I wait at the bar I ask about my favorite bartender I'm told oh they fired is ass! Truly more info than I needed! Especially from the new bartender with no personality that took forever (I was alone empty bar) to serve me my ten dollar gin and tonic. Looks like I'll be sampling one of the many Japanese steak houses not called benihana in the future. W h at a shame. How can someone take a restaurant that was so good and ruin it so fast? It really must take some effort. I just hate to see it. I used to love this place.",

There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF?",

The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at.",

Over the past 20 years or so that we've been coming here, I haven't had a single bad experience. Yes, sometimes you meet some \"unique\" people at your table, but I think that's part of the fun. Whatever you do, don't be that person who sits there with other people and never says hello. Doesn't mean you have to be BFFs the whole meal, but it makes it really uncomfortable if you don't at least try and be a little friendly. The staff here who have worked here for years (like Heidi), are some of the nicest people around, and if you are a good customer, they definitely appreciate it. The shrimp sauce here is far better than Ichiban, Saga, or Nakama. They don't do noodles and rice, but for me that is too many starches anyways. They recently switched to the jumbo shrimp, but if you want the regular size, just ask. They will also still do the \"Samurai Triple\" if you want it, though it isn't on the menu. Overall, they're very accommodating. It's pricey, but the quality is worth it. Also, sign up for the birthday club for a free meal on your birthday!",

    "text": "My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday.   I made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30.   We arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders.   This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations.   We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm.   Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.",

    "text": "Benihana is good, yes, but it is not updated as other hibachi restaurants. The furnishings, carpet, set up hasn't changed in years and the staff/food isn't always up to par. I can eat Paleo here though, which was a new discovery. I've always appreciated sushi, but I never ordered it raw without the fun additions of tempura, sesame seeds, soy sauce, cream cheese, and everything else that makes sushi AWESOME, so this was a new experience. I ordered the Tuna Tatiki, which was 10 chunks of raw tuna. I ordered it without sauce or seeds. It was a little tough to get down because there were so many pieces and after a couple raw pieces, I needed some extra searing, which they did for me no problem! The server was wonderful- she was helpful and had no problem going to extra mile for someone with diet restrictions! I was very happy about this because the last time we sat in the bar, our waiter was really odd. He didn't explain the foods and extra charges (our waiter last night did) and he seemed like we were bothering him. I was happy to have a better experience last night, but I do think that Benihana needs to monitor their staff better. I had negative experiences twice related to incompetent staff, which really made my overall feeling of Benihana go from positive to neutral. Not to mention, the last time I was there, perhaps because we got hibachi at the bar, but it was not very good at all, and I got the most expensive dinner on the menu: \"Ocean's Treasure.\" More recently when I visited Benihana though (the same time I got the raw tuna), I had a better experience- I ordered salmon and yellowtail sashimi. I was very nervous to bite into a raw cut of fish by itself, but was pleasantly surprised at how good the cuts of fish were. The yellowtail had a sweeter taste and the salmon was less sweet, but more flavorful. It was a great to jump outside of my comfort zone and appreciate the rawest of the raw food! I would definitely recommend Benihana due to its location- I love that it is on a hill all to itself, and it's unique mark in Pittsburgh, but I would choose other hibachi restaurants before I would choose this one.",

You go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \"no, you never served me any.\" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them.  I don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No.  The best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money.",

    "text": "I swore that Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in Orlando was the best one I had ever been to, but I think they may have some competition with this one.  My boyfriend and I tried them out on Labor Day, just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.  Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.  The food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan.   After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.",

No, unfortunately <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnot.at&s=73ac579d3e01814e05e957dd00a187a518d6a3289038f513d4b730ecbedbe18a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">not.at</a>.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?  Tuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \"I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\"  Upon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.    Our chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \"waiting for the rice.\"  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.    Two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.    My final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come...",

Our chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag?  I guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good.   We are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga, but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste.",

    "text": "It was very sad to see how Benihana has changed. I've been going to this restaurant since before it was Benihana. The atmosphere was definitely not the same feeling of a Japanese steakhouse.   We didn't have a reservation and supposedly there were two large parties coming in. Ok, so we decided to get dinner in the bar area.   The food has definitely changed. First, the signature shrimp sauce. The sauce that caused a frenzy in all of Pittsburgh when Benihana removed it shortly after taking it over from the Samurai. It likely saved the business by bringing it back. Now they changed it. It was almost the color of honey mustard and it definitely tasted more like a mustard.   Our meals were served warm at best. I don't know how they cooked it in the kitchen, but it makes me wonder what items were prepared ahead of time. The soup was very beefy tasting and usually dark in color. The fried rice was dry like it came out of a steam table. I was not expecting the same taste as if it was prepared right in front of me, but I didn't expect the quality to suffer so much.   My meal alone was not worth the $35 for filet and shrimp. And unless the portion sizes changed, everything was much smaller than I remember from sitting at the hibachi tables.   I didn't have any issues with the bartender or the server. With two large parties coming in, there was not a lot of business for them. Makes me wonder...  The old Samurai era is all gone now. I honestly think that was what the business was based on. You remove that...then you have to compete with places like Ichiban. You can try to match it with Nakama, but you might as well change the name and start over.   So long old friend...we've had some great memories but times have changed you.",

Our drinks were comped and the GM came over more than once to ensure the rest of the meal went well. Our chef, Frank, was funny and cooked our food to perfection. The brown sauce was much better here than other hibachi places we have been to in Pittsburgh.

No explanation, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even close to being busy.    After being seated our conversation was interrupted by two issues.  One the door to the kitchen squeaks, loudly.  Now you can just imagine how many times during a dinner that door is used.  Buy some WD40 please.  The open hibachi station/seating area next to us was being vacuumed.  Which I found rather ironic since the carpeted hallways that surround the bar were so dirty it made me think about leaving.  All of this compounded by the hostess being more concerned with takeout orders, a manager walking in circles and not doing a thing.   Overall, very dissappointing experience.  There are much better and cleaner options.    I am not commenting on our chef/cook because I could tell he was new and not well trained.",

The thing I don't like about hibachi is waiting for a table, so I definitely recommend making a reservation (can be done on their website) and going on a weeknight. I also don't like crowds and I was surprised at the fact that it wasn't very busy on a Thursday night. The wait time for our table was surprisingly very fast, too! We had 6 in our party and I appreciate that they didn't throw 2 strangers at our table.

The restaurant itself is nice and we were seated pretty quickly.  Our waitress showed up 2 seconds later to take drink orders and appetizer/sushi orders. I just asked for water and some time to actually look at the menu. several min later out waitress came back with drinks and asked to take orders. I ordered chicken and steak along with a cranberry mojito. Quickly after taking orders our waitress brought out our soup. I liked it but it lacked salt. Before I even finished the salad course came out. I was able to enjoy both before the chef came out to prepare our meal. What did bother me was all the dishes in our area. I can't stand a dirty table and I wish our waitress would have removed them sooner. Our chef Penny wasn't the best hibachi chef I've seen but she was great with my son and he really enjoyed watching her. She was honestly a lot of fun. The hibachi itself was pretty good. I liked the fried rice which is an up charge. The steak was good and so was the chicken. I honestly don't think it was anything special. Dessert was ice cream also nothing special.   So to sum it up our waitress seemed overwhelmed and managed to make me feel rushed even though I feel she could have visited our table a few more times then she did. That along with being overpriced is why only the 3 stars.",

While I was at the bar the take out employee came over and recommended that I eat in because of happy hour specials, which was so nice and rare (most restaurants just want to get the most money out of you). I decided to take out anyway, just wanted to get home. I paid for my take out and my drink and as I was leaving, two employees came running out to talk to me before I left. They informed me that my card was ran for the wrong amount but it was fixed and handed me two receipts to show they had charged me the original amount. One was a manager and he gave me his name and said to call if there were any issues with the card. So nice and considerate. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand these things happen but they really showed how much they care with how they handled it.",

The waitress came back and moved it back on top of my plate. I had to ask for a new plate. This was last week. We went again this weekend and I noticed that this was happening again.

Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.  We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few \"laps\" of the restaurant, without us asking, the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.    Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.  We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better Benihaha was.",

Mmmmm  I could eat here everyday but I'd be broke, lol.   I first encountered this hibachi steakhouse when I lived in San Diego, CA and was super excited to find out there was one in Pittsburgh, PA.   Reservations are advised to sit at the hibachi tables, which I think everyone should at least once.  If I'm going out after I usually just sit in the bar area at a regular table and skip the hibachi show.  I've NEVER had a bad experience at either location I've gone to in over 10 years.  I'm not normally a fan of fried rice, however, Beni fried rice is phenom and I always get an extra side to take home. Its worth the extra $$ and it re-heats perfectly.",

The hood over the grill has seen better days and we all got enveloped with smoke at some point during the meal.  The meal did not move along at a nice pace.  The appetizer (ordered sushi, but served sashimi) arrived after the soup and salad, and my daughter's brown rice was served just as we were finishing up.

When we arrived, after the confusion of where it was actually located which is atop a small hill that it seemingly shares with apartment buildings.  We come in and are hit with stifling smoke. I'm thinking they need to replace their filters there. Our entire party wasn't there so we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They arrive and we are seated at a congested table setting that hadn't been cleaned (grill) mind you we had to wait.  The area between the two table settings had food and debris on the floor and even egg shells, wow!!!  We asked the waitress could we move to another table and she asked WHY? Really? So we move to a cleaner table but still food and debris on the floor. This time it was shrimp tails and onion or calamari I'm not sure it was round lol.   The Chef Isaiah was friendly and engaging. He did plenty of neat tricks too. He also engaged with my young grand daughter the entire time.  The food was good and well seasoned. Best yum yum sauce I've ever had at any hibachi restaurant.  There was a mistake with my order but no big deal they took off the portion they charged me.  The place is way too expensive . The atmosphere alone isn't appealing or clean enough to be charged what they charge. Furthermore, they do not give you enough portions, rice, noodles, or vegetables to charge patrons those prices.  I gave the 2 stars because of the Chef and the seasoning of the food.  By the way, I had scallop and calamari.",

My bf and I decided to dine in after he found out that there was one in Pgh. He is from florida where Benihana has its headquarters and thought it was only in that state. He was surprised to find this location didn't include all glass windows while on the beach, but hey whatever. its Pittsburgh man!  For you birthday, Benihana emails you a $30 coupon. (valid Mon-Thurs) It is a great coupon considering the basic hibachi dishes are $19 and the entrees with 2 meats costs about $25-40 depending on what you get. I ordered the Benihana Delight-- chicken & shrimp. It was a '6 course meal'-- soup, salad, veggies, rice, chicken+shrimp & ice cream. My boyfriend with the chefs special, steak & lobster.  Our hibachi table only had one other couple at it, so it was very nice. Bob did the cooking for us. He was kind & friendly. We made casual conversation. He didn't do any special tricks but that was probably because there were only 4 (adults) at the table. When kids are there, they seem to do more.   Everything tasted really good. For dessert, I went with green tea ice cream. It was delicious. I expected a heavy flavor and to actually not like it, but it wasn't overpowering & heavy... more like refreshing.   Our server disappeared during our meal despite needing refills. Eventually she did come over but then took awhile for boxes and checks. Also 2 people (including me) were celebrating birthdays and no one sang to us lol. which is a good thing but they went around to every other table. We noticed severs on their phones at a table near the door. Managers should hide them a little better lol. at least it explained where she was most of the time...  I would rate 3.5 stars but I rounded up to 4 :)",

    "text": "No. NO. Run, don't walk, AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  I went there on a random weekday night for a birthday dinner (not mine, thank God). First off just getting into the place was a trial. The \"front\" entrance shares property with a high-rise condominium building, so if you can find your way in, all of the parking at the front is permit-only, and the \"back\" entrance is a super-steep road that leaves you thinking, \"Oh shit, am I going to get trapped in some random dead-end\" right until you hit the crest of an ugly parking lot with broke-down asphalt. Also, the front doors face the back, so it shares a wall with its dumpsters, which is just weird and not appetizing.   When I got there I had to fight my way through a group of people at the front doors smoking (seriously, in 2017). Stepping into the restaurant, the first thing I was hit with was a thick, greasy haze in the air. It was smokier inside than out, and for a moment I had a flashback to the '80s, when smoking was still allowed inside the restaurant. Clearly they just have really crappy fryer vents that probably haven't been updated since the '80s. I started looking around for windows, desperate to crack one. I would have left if I hadn't been there with other people.  I LEGITIMATELY HAD TO GO HOME AND TAKE A SHOWER AFTERWARDS. That's how gross it was.  So we're sitting there, bathing in the greasy air, sharing a table with a bunch of other random people, like you usually do at hibachi places. The people that work at this run-down Benihana were an interesting mix. Our waitress had a deadpan nasal tone and while she was perfectly nice, I half-expected her to snap her gum in my face and ask if \"that was all I needed, sugar.\" Honestly, I would have appreciated her more at a diner where I was only paying $10 for a milkshake and a burger. Ditto for the \"hibachi chef\" who did an acceptable, perfunctory job of cooking everything up. He looked and acted like a short-order cook they'd pulled out of the back in a pinch.  The whole menu is essentially a rip-off. There are 20 or 30 different menu items, and they have exotic names like \"Treasure of the Ocean\" or \"Benihana Special Delight\" but it's ridiculous because they are all the SAME. EXACT. THING. It's just different meats mixed together in random combinations and then seared in front of you to eventually make what looks like a stirfry on your plate. Yes, that's right, ONE BASIC STIRFRY is just about the whole menu. They have two different \"dipping sauces\" - one mayo-based for poultry and beef and one ginger-based for seafood - and that's it. For the price I was paying, I might as well have gone to a local Chinese restaurant, where they actually have a slew of 5 or 6 basic sauces in the back and can make a real stirfry.  Oh, and the menu makes a big deal about the \"5-course\" or \"6-course\" meals. The \"courses\" start with a tiny bowl of light broth and a tiny bowl of shredded iceberg salad, which is pretty standard when you go out to eat at a sushi place. Then the other \"courses \"are a random bit of shrimp that they fry up for you at the beginning of the hibachi grilling session (seriously, how is this a whole appetizer?) and then \"mushrooms.\" Literally just \"mushrooms\" is what the menu says. We eventually figured out that means they add mushrooms to your hibachi meal. Annoyingly, the waitress and cook kept asking if we wanted these \"courses\" added to our plates, like it was optional instead of standard. They also upcharge $3.40 for fried rice, and $3.80 for noodles. Only white rice is included.  Oh, and then the \"courses\" are capped off by a terrible dessert dish of something frozen they called ice cream. I could buy better ice cream from Breyer's at the grocery store. I honestly only ate the ice cream because I was so pissed at that point that I wanted to get my money's worth. The whole menu was literally like 1987 with 2017 pricing - and I want my $35 back.  The only reason there is more than one star is because the meats and veggies they served were of a good quality. When they are cooking everything right in front of you its easy to tell if beef or shrimp is low-quality, and that wasn't the case here.  Oh, and let me just say that when I left the restaurant, thankful to be gone, I took a wrong turn and found their additional lower parking lot.  Turns out the whole restaurant's foundation, because it's on a hillside, doesn't actually rest on the ground. Nope, the whole place is propped up on cement posts with parking underneath the place. I had to back my car up to get out from under there, and when I looked up I saw that the \"roof\" of the lot was an indoor dropped ceiling (office-style), with the rectangular plastic tiles peeling and dangling. I could not leave fast enough.  Honestly, they should just raze this place, sell it to the condominiums and turn it into additional parking for the residents. And that's the nicest thing I can think of to say about my experience at Benihana. Never again.",

    "text": "We went here for my birthday and it was a fun time. The waitress was excellent and was on top of everything, we never had to wait long or even ask for refills. We sat at a table where they cook the food in front of you and the chef was fun. The food was great. The only thing that was a little weird is that it did take a while to get all of the food on our plates, but we did get a lot of food. It started with a little appetizer portion of shrimp for everyone, even those who didn't order shrimp, then vegetables, then rice then the main food. Steak was out last. Before the meal you're given soup and salad and both were great. I would've liked the sushi to be out with the soup and salad but it instead came right before the meal so we were a bit distracted while the chef was cooking. It was an overall good experience and their $30 off coupon for birthdays (check our their website for it) made it very enticing.",

    "text": "I ate here today with a group of five coworkers. We were one of maybe three tables of diners when we arrived, yet the service was the worst I can remember.   We were first told it would be a 20-minute wait for a hibachi table. None were occupied, but we accepted a different table and ordered, assuming the wait would have been based on chef availability. More than 45 minutes after we ordered we saw them cooking rice at a still-unoccupied hibachi table below us; it was for our meals, which finally arrived more an hour after ordering. It's worth noting we all ordered directly off of the lunch menu, and we were even told \"no changes or substitutions,\" making our order even simpler.   Then, we had two errors with the meals.   Aside from the long wait, our server was inattentive and brusque. Questions were sometimes ignored, sometimes answered with one word; it at times seemed like we were an irritant rather than customers, despite being a friendly and polite group that made no special requests and never attempted to flag them down despite the long waits between each stage of the meal. I'm baffled by the overall experience and will not plan to return any time soon.",

I will say the scallops were good, but the \"filet\" was pathetic. I am not sure of the exact cut of meat, but it was unlike any filet I've ever had. Almost seemed like stew meat (photo included). Upon ordering, the waitress asked if you'd like white or fried rice, but never mentions there is a $4 up-charge for the fried until the bill comes. For $39 I could have had a far superior meal elsewhere. To top it off, we applied a coupon to the meal and it came off the post-tax amount. Guessing they just pocket the difference. Upon leaving the place, our clothes had a very strong smell of grease. Honestly would have rather paid $10 for food court style Asian cuisine.",

    "text": "My older brother is special needs and has some personal dietary restrictions. He lives in a care home a few hours away, so when he visited us in Pittsburgh a little while back, I really thought it would be fun for him to experience Hibachi for the first time. I had read some rave reviews about how accommodating Benihana had been in other locations, so we decided to visit Benihana in Greentree. My brother was so excited.  It was almost 10 pm, so we called first to see if they were still seating. They said yes. The place was completely empty. Our waitress was lovely. We told her we wanted to try and make sure my brother had the closest Hibachi experience he could with his dietary limits. One part of my brother's disability is that he only eats the same foods every day and cannot deviate.   I asked if we could substitute chicken for shrimp for the appetizer (assuming there would probably be a small up-charge). We also asked that instead of rice or noodles, if, with his steak dinner, he could just have extra vegetables (again, assuming that there may be a small up-charge). Our waitress was very understanding, but said that she had to check with the manager first. She came back and said the manager said they couldn't accommodate.  I asked to see manager. Directly in front of my brother, the manager said that they weren't able to accommodate and crassly explained that if \"he\" \"wanted\" a chicken appetizer instead of shrimp, we would have to buy a whole chicken dinner and if \"he\" \"wanted\" extra vegetables instead of rice or noodles, we would just have to buy another dinner. I was mortified, my boyfriend was mortified, the waitress looked mortified. My brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down.  This was not the experience I was hoping my brother to have ... a gross display of disgusting and careless discrimination that has made me hurt for him his entire life. He shouldn't have been put in that position.  In case there was any confusion, I calmly made one last ditch effort to privately explain to the manager about my brother, but it was to no avail. I was livid. We paid for our one round of drinks, tipped the waitress - whose compassion touched my heart - and left.  I have to admit, I contemplated escalating this.   Shame on you Benihana. If that manager still has his job, I would suggest some kind of training on how to be a decent human being and not make others feel like they are a second class citizen just because they may be a little different from you. It's 2016. Get with the program.  ***Also, in case you're wondering, my brother has since been back to Pittsburgh for a visit and did get to have his first Hibachi at Saga in Robinson. They were wonderful, accommodating and respectful.",

Turn it up all the way and tell your kid keep the iPad in the car, it's time to hang with the family and stop actin like a humanoid. Benihana ain't got time for that.

    "text": "I just want to update that my opinion on Benihana has definitely gone down after my visit last night for my birthday. It has changed a lot over the years and I think after this visit - I won't be back despite going at least 1-2 times a year.  The only thing great about my visit was the chef (Tommy) was really cool and the meat/seafood cooked well. The greeter at the front desk seemed miserable and not really friendly as you are walking in, the server at our table didn't seem like a people person - both her and the woman cleaning up our area barely acknowledged my guest and I but did with the other young chicks at our table. Were we invisible? I don't know but it was annoying. They usually give you a complimentary photo for your birthday with your guest - we seen them go to other tables doing this but never came to ours as they have done in the past.  One of my biggest complaints is the new up charge of $4 for fried rice. No other hibachi place does this (the meal is already high and more than pays for the fried rice vs white). Benihana never had this upcharge before - not sure if it changed this year but last fall it wasn't the case. The quality of food and friendly service at Benihana is what I liked over the years coming here however similar hibachi restaurants will now be my go-to as the service is not what it used to be here and it is more expensive compared to those other establishments as well - Saga, Ichiban, etc.   There is no benefit to go to Benihana rather than the others now. The other places also do more tricks and have more of a show than the chefs here - the most they do here is throw utensils in the air and light the onions. Saga/Ichiban makes a train out of food, flickers the lights, shoots sake in your mouth, tell jokes, etc.   My tip is to go to any other hibachi but here - where prior years I would prefer it here. They have poor service now, the cleaning staff really had no professionalism, and they have gotten greedy about fried rice. You are already paying $49 for your meal, come on right? How much is the eggs and veggies really costing them? Not cool.",

It's a show and you can reserve a table for 8 or you  can share a table and be mystified by the chefs skills and setting food ablaze. If that's not your jam you can get a regular table and order from the menu. They do fish, chicken, beef and etc. This is a Japanese restaurant so.. if you have an MGS issue the soup has it everything else does not but make sure you ask ok. The food is pretty standard fare, tastes good but could be hotter. Most of us got the lunch specials which came with a protein, vegetables and rice. With lunch you can have the soup or salad. I also ordered the beef dumplings but we had to send them back as they were cold. In all honesty they only had two groups doing Habachi at the tables and us? It was whatever.. our server was good but seemed a little busy considering. Due to my dumpling issue I got hot ones and she took it off the bill. The food was pretty good.. but not memorable. This place is not exactly easy to get to and or find as it shares a parking lot/space with a condo building. Will I be back here probably not or any other Benihana. They have parking..",

It wasn't overly busy but I'm guessing there were waiting for more people to come in so that we could all sit at the hibachi table together. Once we were seated, a waitress came around and took our drink orders. Not long after that, she came around and took our food orders. There was a mix of sushi and hibachi entrees on the menu to choose  from. We opted for the 5 course hibachi entree. It started with onion soup, then a house salad with ginger dressing. After that, our hibachi chef came out and cooked our food right in front of us. He was very entertaining. He cooks different parts of the meal at a time (i.e. did the rice and noodles, then cooked the veggies, then cooked the seafood, then the steaks, then the chicken). So in order for your food to not get cold, we ate as he cooked. They offer two sauces: a housemade red sauce and yum yum sauce. The yum yum sauce was seriously the best I've ever had (and I've been to other hibachi restaurants before). Something in that sauce... lol so good. After dinner, you could get hot tea, ice cream or sorbet. Overall, I thought the food was good- not overly excellent but not terrible. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because they upcharge for almost everything... so it's very easy to rack up an expensive bill. The overall experience was great... I would definitely come back again!",

I've never personally been inside the bathroom of Goodwill on Route 51 but I'm willing to bet cold hard cash that it doesn't smell like a combination of asparagus and eel left out to defrost. If I wanted to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder I am certain that enlisting in the military and liberating the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan would be a much more viable option than undergoing a gas attack in the bathroom of my favorite Japanese restaurant.

We had chicken and rice with a couple sushi rolls. Everything was good and warm. Plenty of food and nothing different than you'd expect. The food was good and there was plenty of it. Nothing really will wow you but you will be satisfied.  We would come here again because we didn't have any issues and it's close to where we live. If you are hungry for decent sushi or hibachi, this should be a good stop for you.",

The   Manager Henry used his hands and touched my mom's food so my dad complained. He didn't like it that my dad complained and my dad wrote a bad Yelp review. Now my dad is banned from eating here. It really sucks because this use to be my favorite restaurant. I mean come on REALLY someone can't have their own opinion about a bad and wrong incident? I wish that all of this will get resolved eventually so me and my dad and my family can eat here again someday.",

My taste buds were immature last time I visited, apparently, as I ordered their veggie sushi again this time and LOVED it. The prices here may seem a little steep, but they are pretty moderate for the quantity you are receiving. Coming here for dinner is not just a regular dinner- it's for entertainment and pure amazement at the talent of the chefs. Our whole party loved the food we received and the show that was put on for us. I recommend always getting the fried rice (over the plain rice) and the spicy hibachi chicken over the regular chicken option... you won't be disappointed!",

It took an hour to get our meals after ordering them. Then only 1 came out. So obviously im not going to eat in front of my date. Hers eventually came out aporox 15 mins later, by then my food was cold.  Everytime i have bern here something similar has happened. I strongly recommend going to one of the other japanese steak houses in the area. The other places are much better. Every one. I have tried them. I learned my lesson and will not be back to this one.",

Once the chef came, he had to keep sending people to the kitchen for food that he forgot. Finally, the food came. The food had no flavor and the chef served raw chicken. Too much bad to type but I know I will definitely never eat here again. I'll drive the extra 15 minutes to Robinson for Ichiban!!! This place needs shut down!",

First, we were given miso soup and then the classic ginger salad. The ginger dressing was very refreshing. Once the chef came out, we were given a little shrimp. Next, was the chicken fried rice which was great especially with the shrimp sauce. Finally, I got the spicy chicken which was given with green onions and mushrooms. The chicken just had a spicy sauce put on it. It was ok nothing great. The sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle. It was also served with grilled onions and zucchini.   Overall, the food was standard nothing special. Also, they ask everyone if they want chicken in their fried rice, but they don't tell you that it is an extra $3.55 per person. Definitely not the best hibachi place, the chef had very little enthusiasm.",

A few positives are that you get a free $30 meal when you sign up online for your birthday and the portions are extremely filling. My dad decided to use his last month and while he enjoyed the food at the time, he immediately got sick as soon as he arrived home and his entire meal came up. I just went here the other night and used my free birthday dinner and the same exact thing happened to me. We also received our check and had gave the waitress our card, then she forgot about everyone at our table and we had to wait 25 min just to get it back until one of us went to ask the manager where she went. Staff was friendly, but unfortunately it is not something we will be looking forward to coming back to.",
