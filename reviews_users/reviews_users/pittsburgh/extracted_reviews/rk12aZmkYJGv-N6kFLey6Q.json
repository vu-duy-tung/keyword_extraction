The service has always been great and polite, they just redid the inside to include better seating, and the best part is that they can split your check to any number of members.  We're going to miss the one server they had there though as she would know our usual order and bring us a round of Mt. Dews, 2 8th Wonders, and a side of bread sticks without even asking if we needed menus.",

    "text": "It's hard to believe I'm the first to review this incredible North Hills pizza destination.  The Luciano family has been serving up delicious, hand-tossed pizzas for dine-in, take-out, and delivery in McCandless Township for over 20 years. As far as I am concerned, they serve the best stuffed pizza (spinach or sausage) in the Pittsburgh area, while their traditional pizza is on par with some of best pizzerias in the region.  But the reason that I return to Luciano's is for their pan pizza with Chicago sauce, an incredibly zesty, wonderfully garlicky, red sauce that stands out as one of the very best pizza sauces I have ever tasted!  We first learned about Luciano's when we had friends living just off McKnight Road, but became addicted to their Chicago-style pan pizzas when I was working up the road in Warrendale and would stop down and pick up a pie to take home at least 2-3 times per month.  It's actually even better if you dine in, but the crust is robust enough to survive transport without becoming a liability.",

However when I received the check I was charged $7.50 for this half order of ziti. When I asked the waitress if I was charged incorrectly I was told that there was a mistake on the menu and that $7.50 was the actual price. Apparently they raised the prices across the board (and very noticeable price increases) and the printer made a mistake with the ziti which is what I was told. I was not informed of this \"typo\" when I ordered the dish and for $7.50 for a half order of ziti with sauce I wouldn't have done so in the first place. When I voiced my concern they didn't offer to honor the printed price on the menu which is what I would have done as a business owner. I was very disappointed with the customer service I experienced tonight and will likely not return. Not to mention a 56% price increase for a half order of ziti. What a shame...",

    "text": "Sorry Luciano's.   I used to love you and order here a few times a month but you picked a bad day to have poor customer service.   I ordered delivery and requested two sides of dressing with my buffalo chicken pizza which you charge additional money for.   When my order showed up an hour later sans dressing you told me you were too busy to correct it (even though it was your error and you charged me for it) and couldn't have someone deliver it on their next delivery run because of how busy you were.  While you offered to refund the charge for the dressing via phone, I really had no interest in my pizza without the blue cheese and you refused to refund the delivery charge or the pizza via phone because the error wasn't large enough to warrant you eating the 11.30 you charged me for the pizza itself.  When I do delivery for convenience and pay to tip the driver and for a delivery charge (a combined extra $5 on my pizza charge) and am a regular customer, you could have treated me a little better instead of calling my request ridiculous.   Being in the customer service industry myself, I can tell you it takes much less effort and cost to retain an existing customer than it does to attract a new customer.   Also, I'm pretty sure making the effort to fix my one order, was worth the several hundreds if not thousands of dollars or more in business that I and the family I've recommended to you have contributed since I moved here.  Plus I previously raved about you on yelp and gave you free advertising!  And to top it all off, I was aggravated enough to drive there, return the pizza and get my full refund so you lost the entire sale anyway plus my future sales!",

The crust on good pizza is supposed to show signs of flour. If you like it loaded with sauce and cheese, with crust thats always crispy and brown but not burnt, this is the place to try in the north hills.  The menu is full of classic Italian dishes that will not disappoint.  I almost dont want to sumit this post because I consider Lucianos the best kept secret in the McCand/Shal/Hamp area.  This I a fine family business that I am glad to patronize.  The owner employs several people in this small family restaurant.  He can be seen during the busiest times of day, working alongside of them.  Its a great place to order takeout and beer, or have a quiet, casual meal in the small dining room.   You need to order the cheesy garlic bread next time you call or stop.",

A large pizza with 2 toppings will be at least $20 but its worth it.  Slices are large and toppings are plentiful.  If the pizza is delivered in a timely manner and the cheese is still warm you will be delighted.  Should your delivery driver stop a smoke a dubbie with his friends (most of the delivery guys are high school seniors) you may be a little let down.  Regardless of temperature, lucianos is still the best around!!!",

The pizza is consistently good and never stale or burnt.  If you're ordering their basic and traditional pizza, expect thin style pizza.  For the pasta, you can opt to order a half order of it instead of the full size and it's a decent sized portion.  If you're ordering something with specific alterations, be sure to emphasize what you want and repeat it because otherwise the people on the phone may get your order messed up.    The actual venue itself could be better.  The dining room is so tiny.

The dining room was crowded , but nothing unusual for dinner time.  Order a hoagie and my wife eggplant parm along with drinks and salads.  The drinks and salads came in a timely manner, but after that things turned bad.  After waiting approximately 45 minutes the waitress informed us that one of the fryers were down.  This would delay our order for the chicken parm.  Next we were told that the printer that send the orders to the kitchen were not working properly which might be the reason our order wasn't complete as of 6:45pm. At no time did anyone suggest that we alter the order so that we could eat a little faster, possibly change the chicken parm if the fryers were down.  We were about to leave mentioning this to the waitress, who told us our order just came up.  We decided to stay, but we're very surprised that the owner who was reportedly there at no time came up to our table and tried to make a bad situation better.  No offer of breadsticks or another beverage until the order came out, no apology or attempt to make a bad situation better.  We asked to speak to the manager, to which we were told what he looked like if we wanted to go talk to him.  We watched another table leave in disgust, part of the table receiving their order, part never did.  In this situation I feel the owner should take a minute and seek out the customer, not the other way around to try to make a very poor experience a little better. I then proceeded to write an email to the owner on their website and have gotten NO RESPONSE!!  Shame on you......",

Went in to place an order for take out and while I was waiting (30 min) for my food, I had the pleasure of listening to the staff complain relentlessly about their customers. One girl shouting out \"how can people call and expect their pizza on time when the order at 7pm on a Friday!\". Ummmmmm....customers call, place an order, you give a time, and they expect their food.... isnt that how it works????  The amount of complaining and banter that went on was entirely unprofessional and it has really changed my view of this business. I can't patronize an establishment that shows such public disrespect of their customers.",

I live out of town now, but whenever I come home to visit, Luciano's is at the top of my to-do list. The toppings are fresh and the crust is excellent. (Their breadsticks are delicious, too!)

    "text": "Let me clarify the star rating. The rating is really only based on the pizza/food because customer service gets ZERO stars. Too bad Yelp doesn't have negative stars.   Absolutely miserable customer service here. We've been to Luciano's four times this summer. They have a pretty tasty pan pizza and good pizza in the North Hills is like finding a needle in haystack. Our third trip - the pizza was ready long before the 20 minutes we were told, so when we picked it up and got home (literally, a mile away) the pizza was COLD.  Tonight was probably the worst trip thus far. Here's the timeline: 7:00 - order pizza and wings. Told 25 minutes. 7:20 - arrive and pay for pizza. The pizza is done and sitting on top of the oven. Wings are not ready. 7:30 - I asked a man who I believe is the manager, how much longer our wings will be. They just went into the fryer - 3 more minutes. 7:35 - Wings are done.   I asked the 'manager' why my pizza was done long before the wings. It doesn't make sense that wings take longer than pizza. He mumbled something about the fryer sometimes backing up and walked away from me. HE TOTALLY BLEW ME OFF! Irate? Oh, yes.   So they hand me the pizza and wings, and the bottom of the pizza box is cold. I said, so when I get home and open this and the pizza is cold, can I come back and get my money back? They offered to reheat it in the oven - but as expected - re-heating it also dried out the crust and cheese.  Fail.   There was no apology. No empathy. Just plain terrible customer service. Is it really that hard to time cooking pizza and wings?!",

They told me 30 minutes. So I went to pick it up at 7:15...I did not receive my order until 7:45. For reference I ordered a small pizza and a chicken salad, so it was not a large order. It was clear upon my arrival that they were backed up with a long line of customers waiting to pick up orders. Obviously they severely under estimated the amount of time needed to make their orders. I have never waited that long for a pizza during pickup and I don't know if I'll order again from them for this reason. I am only giving them 3 stars because the food was indeed very good.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday night with my fiance and a friend for dinner.  We arrived to a mostly empty dining and were told that we could sit anywhere.  The dining room is quite small, maybe 10 or so tables but was very bright and clean.  There weren't really any decorations to speak of but I will mention that I really enjoyed the cheese and red pepper flake shakers that they had on the table.  They had replaced the traditional caps that are at every other pizzeria with much better versions that while still controlling the flow allowed you to put on the right amount without getting clogged.  For dinner the three of us decided to split both a large pan pizza with no toppings and then a large traditional pizza with chicken as a topping.   As with most pizzas, they can be broken down into the major components, cheese, sauce and crust.  Both the cheese and the sauce were the same for both of the pizzas that we had ordered.  The cheese was actually pretty good and I enjoyed whenever I got a large amount of it on the piece that I was eating.  The sauce was, well, different.  Its not that it was bad as it was certainly acceptable but I couldn't put my finger on what made it different.  Finally the crust.  The pan pizza came out looking much like what you would get at a Pizza Hut but it certainly had a better texture and flavor.. While a Pizza Hut pizza is dense and greasy this pan pizza crust was crispy throughout and yet still kept a light and airy interior which was nice.  The traditional pie also had a good crust where the outside was crispy and the inside was warm and slightly doughy.  The chicken on the traditional pie was also good and as our friend said, \"not rubbery\".  I guess she has been to too many places that cook the heck of the chicken but this was not one of them.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again in the future.  While it is not at the top of my list for a traditional pizza I also would not stay away from it but if I was really craving a pan pizza, this is where I would head.",

    "text": "I ordered takeout on a Friday night. The guy at the front desk was not so friendly! Maybe he dad had a rough day. Thy were fast and timely. I ordered a large pizza and a chicken salad.  The pizza was OK. Not what you expect from a professional pizza place. The crust was not cooked enough. The toppings were not attached to the surface and the vegetables were almost raw. It was OK but. I didn't like it.  The salad was good. It has a Pittsburghese touch by adding a few fries.  Their beer collection also is a positive point.",

    "text": "This review is based on a takeout order of eggplant parm!  Luciano's is super close to my house, and while we haven't gotten their pizza yet, I was excited to get some eggplant parm last week. my husband went to pick it up and they were super quick, which was great.   But when I finally got to taste my meal, it was INCREDIBLY bland. I wasn't a fan of the sauce. I tend to like sweeter sauces and this wasn't one that sit well with me. Eggplant parm is also usually very cheesy and they went very light on the cheese. I would actually rather have eggplant parm at Olive Garden, which is a shame, because I would much rather order from a local business.  That being said, I have heard great things about their pizza and am still looking forward to trying it!",

    "text": "We order Luciano's for delivery quite frequently. We have been patrons of the restaurant for over 15 years and the reason why we continue to order from them is their consistency. We always know what to expect from them and we love it. Their pizza is great; the ratio of crust to sauce to cheese is so important since too much cheese makes a pizza gummy, too much crust makes it too dry and too much sauce makes it, well, too saucy. You will not find any of those issues from Luciano's pizza.  We usually order a hoagie as well, we usually get the Italian which is always good but today we got the steak and it was fine but I think the Italian is better. Just my personal preference though.   I've also had their wings which are always just the way I like them too.   Delivery is fast and the food is always hot when it arrives. Affordable, fair prices. Maybe someday we will try something else new, but we just love our regular spread so much that it's hard to branch out. I'm sure we wouldn't be disappointed whenever we do decide to try a specialty pizza or another different menu item. I definitely recommend this place and we will continue to order from them!",

She seemed very annoyed that I was even ordering. When she repeated the order back to me wrong And I corrected her she got very irritated again stating that she had to start all over. I asked her what was wrong and she stated she was in a lot of shoulder pain. Doesn't matter, as a manager in customer service myself, none of how she handled herself was ok.   Then I called back to cancel it because I was concerned about someone tampering with our food. She got on the phone and apologized and said that's just how she talks and people think she's mad all the time. I didn't buy it at all. In a service industry you can not conduct yourself so unprofessionally ever. She swore my food would be fine.   Our food arrived 15 minutes late and was cold. I'm so disappointed. Never again.",

The cheese pie was so very cheesy and yummy- could have been done just a little bit more, the next time I'll order well done and it'll be perfect.

Also, prices are very reasonable and delivery was very quick. Ny style with pepperoni was good and the Chicago style although it was kind of just a thick pizza (no butter crust) was very flavorful.   I will get from here now on. Never crossed my mind to try them because I usually order from eat24 or GrubHub.
