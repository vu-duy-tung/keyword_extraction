We get there and they had made the wrong items and gave us hoagies instead.  Had we not been in a time crunch, it wouldn't have bothered me but really, don't make it seem like it's our fault!  It was good, but not as great as I had once imagined.  Basically a wedgie is similar to a calzone but think of it as a sandwich enclosed in pizza dough and then you eat it with italian dressing.  Pretty much a pick up and go type of joint, no tables inside.",

I tried ordering from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fallmenus.com&s=fc06c95fb79ed04cecf8a34f2a1fe0af54e720572c6b7050d5a229da4d84cb5c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">allmenus.com</a> (which is fantastic).  Before I try a new place, I always look at their info FIRST to make sure I'm in their delivery range and check the delivery cost.  This included ALL of the triangle in their range and said no delivery fee.  I placed an order, with the delivery time in 45-60 minutes.    OVER an hour later, allmenus called to tell me that the restaurant had called them, cancelled my order, and said I was out of their delivery range.  I told the rep that that was not the case on their website, and he said he could only tell me what the restaurant said.  I should have been EATING by now, and now I had absolutely nothing coming.  I called the restaurant and asked for the manager.  I explained what had happened and he said that they won't deliver downtown.  I told him that if that's the case, they need to inform the website of it so that people like me don't get screwed over later.  Instead of asking me to hold on, he just started talking to other people in the restaurant asking if they had called.  Well of course they had - or I wouldn't have called him - I was talking about calling them for something else!  I repeated myself, and then told him that waiting over an HOUR to inform me of the problem was completely unprofessional, and he told me that if I was going to criticize him then he would cancel his account.  HAHAHA what account?  His listing on allmenus? Go ahead, buddy, I don't own that website, you only lost a customer, and any other potential customer who knows me or reads the reviews online about them.   Unbelievable.  PLEASE do not give these people your money - it is better spent elsewhere.",

This review is for the old Larry and Carol's under the previous owners. So the star rating is not to be seen as that accurate.  Back when I lived in Souf oakland this was my favorite pizza place from 1994-1999/2000. They use to have this pizza on the menu called the pizza duo.  It was the most amazing pizza I had ever had.  It was a pizza on top of a pizza.  A co-worker of mine was the cousin of the then manager?  He passed and the duo passed with him.  After his passing the duo was never cooked in the center properly.  I see that it is no longer on the new owners menu. So sad since this was such a great invention. I turned many friends, including culinary students on to L&C. Their duo and specialty pizzas were the best and impressed my chef friends. After 99-2000 and the passing of the cousin we started going to Say Cheese. The question remains since the menu and the hours of operation have changed so much (no longer open till 3-4 A.M.) should they really be allowed to keep this historic name the same? In my opinion no.  This is not the Larry and Carols of yesteryear. Those years you shlepped (and sometimes friends even rollerbladed) through the dark alleyways of souf Oakland in the wee hours of the night to get an amazing creation are long gone. The memory and my copy of the old paper menu will live forever.  As for the new owners I wish them good luck in their business.",

So I placed an order with them online for two deluxe calzones and it arrived 45 minutes late. Understandably, the restaurant can be short-staffed on a Sunday night but not only was the delivery late, the delivery man addressed me very rudely and cursed me out. This was inexcusable behavior and bore a bad name for the restaurant. I called the restaurant's night manager who gave me nothing more than a snappy apology.  The calzones themselves were decently sized and filled with good oily ingredients but the crust was too thick for my liking.  I will remember to not tip the driver beforehand next time, IF I will even consider ordering from such an establishment.  *Update* I gave them another try a year later and when I undertipped the driver (~10% on a $7 delivery) he later sent me a very rude text message calling me an \"ignorant a**\" and finished it off with \"don't order food anymore a**hole\"  Ok, I'll take your advice. You just lost my business and everyone in my apartment after I told them this story.",

The two virtues of Larry & Carols is that they are open until really late, and the food is fairly cheap. On the other hand, the food is average at best, and downright terrible at worst. Everything is overly greasy, and their pizza and calzones could charitably be called 'unique.' They often leave out items when delivering, and take a pretty long time to do so.  All in all, probably the worst option for late night food. I would highly recommend finding somewhere else. On the other hand, they avoid getting a single star because they are open later than any delivery joint other than Domino's and Vocelli's, and because nothing there has made me physically ill.",

I ordered delivery and I live only a few blocks away, and my meal came almost 45 minutes later than I expected. In addition, I paid extra for a nice salad and they gave me not what I ordered, but a cheaper salad. When I called with this complaint, the manager basically said \"what do you want me to do about it? Bring you a whole new salad?\". So, I ended up getting ripped off and paying for more than i received, and I waited far longer than I should have. With all this being said, what I did receive was tasty so you won't see me criticizing the food.",

Cheese steak wedgies with extra cheese and add banana peppers is the way to go.  Italian dressing comes on the side.  Wedgies are like a pizza that they flipped half over and didn't seal so you can get in there and add the dressing (and anything else you want).

The quality of the Larry and Carols' pizza would probably hit a 5-6/10 if you ask me. It's a satisfying, yummy pie with good distribution of sauce, cheese and crust. So while the pizza is just average, the fact that the menu offers a \"King Kong\" 30 inch pizza option should be enough to satisfy any pizza lover's passion. The King Kong is a great option for game days, campus events or just some 'ol American gluttony.  I never did the King Kong Pizza Challenge in store, but my buddies and I tried to eat one in a hour by ourselves in an, it didn't go well. I've attached the photos for your sadistic entertainment.  Also, King Kong is a dope movie. 1933 was a weird year and that movie really helped turn things around and establish legitimacy in American sci-fi/disaster movie making, so thanks for doing cinema some justice, Larry and Carols.",

    "text": "Let me add to the horrible reviews this place seems to amass.  Bad customer service, bad menu, and worst of all, bland tasting food.  I have heard many people say to steer clear of this place and I have done so until recently.  My coworkers were ordering food and since I was without I decided to order with them as well.  I mean, what else can you do when you are kind of stuck and hungry.  Once I read over the menu I opted for an item.  I am not a total grammar nazi, but I do get a little irked when a grammatical error messes with the food I order.  The item I ordered off their menu (a menu that they sent to the printer and then handed out to their customers) is listed as follows:  \"Italian, Sausage, Meatball, Roni.\"  Now, if you are like me, seeing the comma, you assume that all that is included in the Calzone.  I thought awesome, basically a meat lovers calzone.  When the order went in I got a meatball calzone.    Upon inquiry of why this was so they told me that it was only one meat in this calzone.  So the question that instantly came to my head is why list them all on one line.  If you have no meat lover style calzone, make sure your menu doesn't make the customer think that.  If you have a Italian, sausage, meatball, and roni calzone separately; list it that way.  Everything else is listed separately on the menu, it obviously isn't that hard to do.  As for the taste of the food, I have definitely had better.  Nothing to write home about there.  In fact the food tasted kind of dry.  Not sure how you can make cheese taste dry, but they were able to do so here.",

The food arrives, the delivery boy doesn't say a word to me but gives me the box and walks away. I open the box-- the pizza is covered in saran wrap??? Upon closer inspection the mushroom and onion toppings I ordered appear to be completely raw. They just threw 'em on top of the pizza, I guess.
