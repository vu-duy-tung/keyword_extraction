    "text": "I've had CPK twice now, first time was takeout and the second was dine in. I am obsessed with fish tacos and so of course when I saw that on their menu that's what I ordered for the takeout. I loved that you can do it all online and it's pretty easy. The tacos were good, kind of similar to the ones you can get from Houlihans, but not as good.  For my dine in experience, my friend and I ordered an appetizer... she is kinda picky so we just got the Spinach Artichoke dip... I thought it was very plain, not very many chunks of actual artichoke (which made me sad). I ordered the White Pizza (my other choice would have been the one with artichokes... but since we ordered the dip I opted not to). Every other place I have ever had white pizza at has had tomatoes on it. So I was super disappointed when it arrived and there was none. I even asked because I really just assumed it was meant to be on there! Nope... they don't do that. Awkward. It lacked taste for that reason. I wouldn't order it again. (And I know its partly my fault, I should have read menu more thorough... but seriously... NO TOMATOES?)  I'll go back, hopefully I'm happier next time.",

And the sauce was sweet to the point of cloying. The cheese had already begun to congeal and harden by the time it came out. The wait staff dissapeared and were impossible to get a hold of. Its as if they knew we'd send it back if they made eye contact.  The appetizers were pretty good but the portions were so paltry that they barely provided more than three bites. The description in the menu was that they were \"great for sharing\" Um.... no, methinks not.   Honestly this is the worst pizza I've had in years. I don't understand the hype, perhaps just the Pittsburgh Ross Park location is bad. But I know I won't waste my time or money there again. If you want good pizza pretty much any other place will give you a better meal and for a lot less.   My recommendation for amazing wood fired pizza (and far cheaper) is Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville. I'm sure there are tons of great places in da burgh for Pizza. CPK is NOT one of them.",

The appetizers were okay but so tiny that they were barely a couple bites each. It was expensive, the food was cold. It was one of the worst meals I've had in years. I honestly cannot believe that this chain has been successful, A Trib review claimed that this was a  taste of California. Putting California in your name doesn't make that come True. Perhaps we're not as cosmopolitan in Pittsburgh as our counterparts in the sunny West. But we're not complete rubes either. A taste of California would mean fresh, well prepared meals with fresh veggies and bright flavors. Garbage pizza with bottle barbeque sauce poured all over it and topped with cheese that makes government cheese look good isn't it.",

It is a fairly small location so expect at least a 30 to 45 minute wait on weekends. There is also about 50 more seats outside for when the weather is nicer. You can always call ahead and get your food to go.   The service was pretty good given that the place was packed. I had the Korean BBQ Steak Tacos as a appetizer and my wife had the Wedge Salad. My tacos were delicious with just enough heat and kick. My only complaint was that the portion was small. (you get two) I could have easily downed two more. Our daughter had the Kids Cheeseburger Pizza and loved it!   My wife and I had the Meat Cravers Pizza which consisted of sausage, pepperoni, bacon, Capicola ham, salami, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. We got it on a honey wheat whole grain crust.  IT WAS EPIC! The pizzas are six cut which is plenty for two people.  I had the Mango Iced Tea and my wife had the Mango Lemonade. They were both very tasty. The lemonade is extremely sweet so I would let it water down a bit before drinking it.   I'm really happy California Pizza Kitchen is here and will be going back often. I still have to try the Butter Cake and White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake.  Hopefully we'll get more locations in the Pittsburgh area. Cough!, Monroeville!, Cough! Waterfront! Cough!",

I had lunch there today after over a year. The husband got what he always loved here, the pear & gorgonzola pizza and I got the veggie grilled sandwich with tortilla soup and Mediterranean veggie rolls for appetizers. I have to say, the food was nearly inedible. The soup was a thick mushy blend of something that didn't sit right with me every time I took a bite, as if they put whatever leftovers they had and blended it. The sandwich was soggy. The med veggie rolls were just baked tortillas rolled up with cheese inside and served with marinara sauce from a jar, and the pear & gorgonzola pizza also didn't taste fresh. Needless to say, we will no longer be returning to cpk...ever!",

My favorite appetizers there are the Asparagus & Arugula Salad (so light yet so tasty!), White Corn Guacamole & Chips (super delicious!), Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (seriously so good), and Lettuce Wraps. Sometimes I just order all four of those instead of a meal.  Outside of those apps/small plates, I have only had a few of their pizzas: the Margherita and Roasted Garlic Chicken are the only two I remember lol (hey, it's been awhile!). The margherita has been great majority of the times that I have ordered it. The roasted garlic chicken did not sit well with me. The garlic taste was way overpowering because they have rather large pieces of cloves scattered throughout the pizza. Imo, I love garlic, but it should be kept to a minimum as the flavor is incredibly intense.  Drinks-wise CPK does alright, nothing special. I wouldn't go just for drinks, I should say. There are a few places I would put ahead of them. Anyway, if you're in Ross Park Mall and hungry this is definitely a better pick than anything else in the mall, including the Cheesecake Factory.",

Yummy blue cheese dressing with bacon, chopped egg and fresh diced tomatoes.  We also got a Hawaiian Bar-be-que pizza with whole wheat crust to share.  I love their fresh pineapple, BBQ chicken, Gouda & mozzarella cheeses, yummy barbecue sauce, sliced red onions and cilantro.  The chicken on this pizza is so tender.  Love this pizza!  I wish I could make this crust at home!    We decided to share a red velvet cake for dessert.  The cake was amazing.  The cake is very moist and the vanilla bean cream cheese frosting is not too sweet.  It was served on vanilla bean sauce with a big scoop of Haagen-Dazs.  It's a little pricey, but SO worth it!

The bad news is that this gets a bit of a wait during peak shopping times.   I've been seated inside several times but last night I had the pleasure of sitting outside and really enjoyed it.  The weather was perfect and while the service was a little slow, they were very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the white sangria which has a hint of mango in it and is sooo delicious that I've never managed to make it any further down the drink menu.     I've tried several pizzas over the past few months and have enjoyed all but one.  The chipotle chicken was very good although spicy and I also liked the roasted artichoke and spinach and the california club (minus the bacon).  I know.  I know.  I'm probably one of the few people in Pittsburgh who doesn't believe bacon makes everything better.  The only one I haven't liked to date was the five cheese and fresh tomato.  It was very blah and there are so many local pizzerias and Italian eateries that make a much better version.  I think the pizzas are a perfect size to split between two people (3 slices each) and still leave a little room for dessert.  Yes, dessert.  Be sure to save room for the butter cake w/vanilla ice cream.  It melts in your mouth although the calories and fat content must be through the roof.  It's big enough that I'd recommending sharing rather than getting your own.",

This is a good location and a welcome addition to the rather dried-up selection of places to eat in the north hills. The environment is welcoming and friendly. Typically we will each order a pizza of our own - don't expect a single to feed two. I can't think of a pizza that we've ordered that I didn't enjoy.   If you haven't been here, definitely give it a try. You may find that parking on this side of the mall is difficult to say the least.

I will say that I was never offered a refill on my drink, which was a bit disappointing.  The traditional pizza was great.  I really like the flaky crust.

She no longer works at the mall so we don't have a change to visit as much as we used too.  This location has always been busy. I suggest getting there early and expect to wait in a short line, because they do not take reservations. For being here several times, I find nothing impressive nor disappointing, average experience at best. We order mostly pizza and salad. We do love the crispy Mac-Cheese appetizer. It was the first time we tried it and loved it, sadly every restaurant now offers it and makes it not a novelty any longer.  We have had the Pepperoni hand tossed pizza. We have ordered the \"Works\" as well; Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Mozzarella Cheese, Onion, Green Peppers, NO Olives. We have ordered the Mushroom, Peppers, Sausage. We have always had our pizza with a Field Green half Salad to split.  I love Key Lime Pie, I make it a mission to seek out the very best. I don't care for California Pizza Oven's pie. I can't speck of the Pasta, I have never tried it, other have said it was good but nothing special about it. I do agree with others post, it is a bit overpriced for what you receive. The food is good without a doubt, but not worth the price. We have used gift cards, which has helped to offset some of the price. The service is good and friendly and I have never had a bad experience. It does take forever to get a refill or a box or your check, we learned the first time to ask for the check as soon as they drop off the food, and remind them of a box when they bring back the bill. They do offer a mobile app which looks interesting, but I have no need for it, we don't visit often. It's pricey but worth the visit with a gift card.",

    "text": "I know it's a chain, but man, did I have some good food here.  For me, the only problem I ran into here was that when we entered the hostess was MIA.  Making us stand in a line for only about five minutes.  After that little hold up, it was smooth sailing.  My friend and I opted to sit at the bar instead of taking up a table...good choice on our part.  Upon sitting down we were greeted by the bartender promptly, I believe his name was Brian (if I'm wrong, I apologize to you sir).  We were asked what we wanted to drink and given some menus.  While looking over the menus my friend and I decided to partake in an adult beverage.  I stayed with what I knew and had a beer, my friend had their berry sangria.  His words for the taste, \"It's like drinking Kool-Aid.\"  After that we ordered an appetizer.  Opting for the sesame ginger chicken dumplings.  The mixture of flavors were very good.  The addition of scallions to a bite made the flavors pop even more.  We were still debating on what pizza to get when our appetizer had arrived.  Upon asking the bartender what his thoughts were about ordering just one pizza and he said that with an appetizer, it should be enough; he was right.  We got the Sicilian, and my god was it good.  It was a mixture of meats, mozzarella, and a spicy marinara sauce.  I believe we had it made sitting at the bar too.  Once the pizza arrived the bartender said since we were sitting there, the pizza chef put a little extra toppings on there for us.  I mean, when you sit at the bar, you get to see all the food being made.  So thumbs up to you pizza chef (he had also said that making the Sicilian was one of his favorites to make).    Overall, the experience I had here will definitely warrant a return visit.  Points to note: outdoor seating during warmer months, they take reservations (so call ahead if you know it will be busy), Entrances from both outside and inside the mall.",

But this review is for today, and today's experience has been the best so far.  Todd is a friendly and gracious waiter. He stopped by our table enough, not to absent and not smothering. Very happy with him.  The food portions are pretty large, the half-sized pear salad and the white pizza filled myself and my make companion, no room for dessert. Everything was tasty. We ordered a plain white pizza (not on the menu) to take home for a picky teen, and it came in time, but with a burn sport so they gave us an additonal pizza to take on the house! What service!  We plan to come back.",

Sharing is caring after all, ha!  Anywho, we got a thin-crust wild mushroom pizza, the BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a $30 lunch special for two (one app:  spinach-artichoke dip, two entrees: the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza & the Original BBQ Chicken pizza, and a dessert:  Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake).    Everything was SO good.  The Wild Mushroom and BBQ Chicken pizzas were especially delicious.  I don't know how other CPK chains are, but the one in Ross Park Mall is legit.  If you're looking for a good meal after shoppin' up a storm, hit this place up.  This CPK is WAY better than the Cheesecake Factory next door.  Trust me, you'll thank me later!    Oh, and the service here was great!  Our waitress was super nice AND quick.",

Sorry, CPK lovers, I dont get the obsession with this place. It is mediocre at best. I got a California club pizza, one of their \"signature\" items. It was a white pizza with some chicken and avocado on top. Underwhelming is an understatement. When it came to the table I instantly thought \"I just paid for this?\". Fiance got the ravioli - one giant bowl with about 6 pieces of pasta in it that he ate in about 15 minutes. We walked out the door with an almost $50.00 bill when the tip was all said and done. Totally overpriced for sub-par chain food. I would rather eat at the food court.   I will most likely never be back here unless I am forced in a group of people who want to eat here and I dont want to be rude and make a fuss. Otherwise, I think I'll steer clear.",

This is the only location I know of in Pittsburgh, so we have visited a decent amount of times. I'm semi-ashamed to say (no I'm not) that I've only ever ordered the BLT pizza! I cannot stray from it! Sadly, they took it off of the menu, but they are still able to make it, thank goodness! I could truly eat it every week it's so good. Everything tastes fresh, not like it was frozen and full of preservatives. Whether it is or isn't, it at least doesn't taste like it!   As far as the restaurant itself, it has always been clean and the staff has been friendly. The most recent time we were there we had one of the most friendly servers I've ever experienced. He was extremely nice, helpful, and attentive. Thank you for making our dinner enjoyable!",

From the minute we sat down our waitress seemed like she was in a hurry to get home. The food was not as good either, cold salad which was supposed to be warm, 5 shrimp in each (15 bucks for the same salad but 5 bucks extra with shrimp...5 bucks per shrimp per salad...a buck a shrimp?) Really??? Skimpy on the shrimp. Overpriced, some ingredients missing since first visit, cold not warm as it should be, etc. Service again was rushed and abrupt. She practically slammed the plates down in front of us and not in a way to uncrowd the table as we were sharing some of the pizza, (which is pretty good, the cauliflower veggie) but again way overpriced for a small 6 cut pizza at almost $18. Nope. Decent food and service 1st visit, but no so good on the 2nd. And again...ABSOLUTELY OVERPRICED for the quality and portions. Doubtful we'll return. I'd rather take the 65 bucks and go to Sesame Inn.",

I believe that I've eaten at this location three times over the last several years. I've only ever had pizza here - Pear Gorgonzola, Hawaiian BBQ, and White Cheese. All three of these pizzas were delicious. I'm actually dreaming of the White Pizza right now!   Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait... maybe 30 minutes or so.   Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price. And since I like consistency, and am dreaming of their pizza right now, I give them 4 stars!",

    "text": "I had always had this impression that they only served pizza, and nothing else. I was totally wrong! I recently moved by the Ross Park Mall so I decided to finally give them a shot. First time I had the meat cravers thin crust pizza. This was delicious! For some reason I just love salami on pizza. It goes so good with pepperoni, and this pizza has that! It was a very unique taste and look of the pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I give that pizza 5 stars!! I would go back for more of the thin crust options, as I love a crispy thin pizza and not many places have that!  Second time I was here was a little less appetizing. I ordered the original BBQ chicken chopped salad. The actual salad part with all the yummy veggies, cheese, and dressing was delicious and I would certainly get it again, but the \"chicken\" was completely gross. I don't really know what they did to it or where it came from but I honestly don't think it was fresh chicken breast, it was almost comparable to a subway quality chicken. Don't get me wrong, that type of chicken is fine, but for a $12-$14 salad, I would expect warm, freshly grilled chicken. This chicken was cold and just not appetizing. So word of advise, ask for fresh grilled chicken if that's what you really want on your salad!  Service and atmosphere is good and it is a nice bright restaurant. Always very clean!   I am sure I will give them another try in the future, as that pizza was good, and I will remember to ask for the good chicken!",

From an overview of the other reviews, it seems that service here can be a give or take, but coming in on a Sunday afternoon revealed a pretty calm atmosphere and overall attentive service by our waiter.   From the start we were taken in, as the manager, upon finding out it was our first time there, offered us a flat bread on the house. They had several kinds, and the spinach and mushroom that we got was delicious. As for the pizza, we only tried the California Club this time, which was almost like a salad on top of the pie, and a very hearty one at that. Will definitely return for another pizza next time.",

Although I didn't get a glass this time, I would like to say that their white sangria is AMAZING. It might be the best I've ever tasted! I crave it regularly!  We were seated by a manager, who told us to grab him if we needed anything. He was friendly and professional. Normally, the servers here are super attentive and very professional, too. They are trained to pour in front of you, which is a nice touch. Our waiter this time was very Spanish, spoke a hundred miles a minute, and was very hard to understand. He was very nice though, but not completely attentive. He looked a little overwhelmed even though there weren't many tables in his section. I have had better service at this location before.  I got a 5 cheese pizza and Tom got a California Club sandwich, which he loved. My pizza was good, as usual. Ate the whole thing! I also signed up for their rewards by getting the app on my phone. I got a free small plate (like a smaller appetizer) just for signing up!   I have heard that they are known for their butter cake dessert, but I prefer to go next door to the Cheesecake Factory and get a piece of cheesecake to go instead! :)  Overall: Go check it out! And try the butter cake and let me know if it's better than cheesecake! :)",

My husband was able to choose from 13 different items on a special Veterans Day menu. He went with the Hawaiian Pizza. Surprisingly (not!) he ate the whole thing. Said it was good. I never tried so I'm going to go with that! I was so looking forward to getting my favorite pizza of all time, the Pear and Gorgonzola. I almost cried when it wasn't on the menu!! Our waiter said it had been gone for a few months already. If the powers that be are reading this review I demand you bring that pizza back. PLEASE BRING BACK THE PEAR AND GORGONZOLA PIZZA!!!! I went with the spinach and roasted artichoke pizza instead. It was good, but not as good as the other one. It had a very, very thin and crispy crust and there was one piece of artichoke on each slice of the pizza. I would have preferred more, but that's what I got. That as well as the spinach was layered over a well thin spread of CPK's spinach artichoke dip which is one of their appetizers. I did like it though and wouldn't hesitate to reorder. For an app we went with the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. People, these are amazing. Every time I get them I think they couldn't be this good, but they are. I insist you try them. My husband is not really an avocado fan and even he thinks they are awesome!  The are stuffed with amazing goodness and deep fried in a crispy wonton. Dip these puppies in the ranchito sauce, a little bit spicy, and you have one of these best bites to go in your mouth. Love them so much!",

I would say that the food is a little bit on the heavier side though, especially the avocado spring rolls I got (which were good btw...but still really oily and heavy). But besides that, the pizza was delicious, a nice thin crust and really nice combination of toppings. I really liked the chicken bbq pizza because it had a nice blend of sweet and smoked flavor, along with good accessory toppings. Would definitely come back to this place because it's convenient and in the mall, and also because the food is just comforting.",

I ended up having the soup and salad combo (Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley with the Spinach + Quinoa Power Salad) and not only was it delicious, it was the perfect portion size.

Then I remembered I have a 14-month old child in tow, there is no respite EVER. All kidding aside, they staff were very accommodating with us and our feisty toddler. Our waiter was also super sweet with our little girl. We made a lunch out of appetizers and ordered a plain cheese pizza off the kids menu for the baby.  I had flatbread with Brussels sprouts and bacon which was DELISH.  The crispy mac n' cheese was enjoyed by both adults and baby. AND the kids cheese pizza was very good, even if baby girl preferred her cheerios and milk, I enjoyed it. Would definitely go back next time we're at the mall and in the mood for table service. No lie, husband and I both got a beer, you can't get that kind of comfort at the food court!",

This was our first visit and it took us a couple minutes to decide what we wanted.  We came to CPK for the pizza, but honestly, it was a little disappointing that their pizza section in the menu looked like the smallest part and hard to find, I'm pretty sure you can find more of their pizza in the frozen food section at Kroger.  When we were ready, we ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, which was my impression it came with a crispy thin crust, per the menu.  Our waiter was nice at this point, keeping up with our table, he brought out some bread and oil after we ordered.  The bread though, was like looking for a needle in a haystack on the plate, two tiny pieces, what's the point of serving bread if your bread slices aren't bigger than a half dollar.  Finally when our pizza came out, just looking at it was disappointing, the edges were all burnt, charred so much the crust burned off.  As far as a crispy thin crust, not quite, it was a workout to chew through.  The rest of the pizza, the insides with all the ingredients, was actually very tasty, so I definitely enjoyed that.  A couple minutes after we finished eating, the manager was walking around, he took our dishes and asked how it was, we responded that things were good.  After the manager left, we were sitting at the table for at least 20 minutes before our waiter decided to come back and offered the check, our drinks were dry, and I would've liked another water, but I was just ready to leave at that point.",

They do offer salads, desserts, and drinks but unless you are sharing expect to pay a bit more for your pizza. Sharing is permitted with no additional fee.  On this visit my friend and I shared a vegetable topped pizza. Before you get it you are served 4 small breads with dipping sauce. They do not give you an extra plate for your pizza. While the food was average we usually end up taking the rest of it home.  Service is good. They are located right inside the main entrance of Ross Park Mall. You can choose to eat indoor or outdoor. It is really not a place I would go out of my way for but have to be in the mood for it.  They have WiFi but a very poor one to say the least. The place is clean and nice rest rooms.    I feel the pizza is overpriced but you are in a sit down restaurant so there's no much else you can do about it. I am usually able to get in without a long wait.",

I also love the pesto cream pasta.  Unfortunately, the service is a bit inconsistent at times. However, today we had a phenomenal server named Emily.  My mom & I waited about 15 minutes for my cousin to join us. Emily made sure we had enough to drink & even gave us bread to tied us over. My mom is very chatty & Emily was always willing to listen & has a great personality. You never had to beg for more drinks & she checked on us multiple times. She is definitely the best server we had here & most other places.",

We ordered the silician pizza on cauliflower crust and fettuccine with shrimp and chicken.  It didn't take long for the pizza to come out but the past took an extra 15-20min which they explained they ran out and had to make it fresh  Once we got both our dishes we asked for avocado and extra marinara sauce. Which then took and 30 min when our food was basically cold and almost done.  They did rectify the situation by covering our meals. So we only paid for our drinks.  The pasta was delicious and full of flavor.  The pizza toppings were delicious but the cauliflower crust was chewy.   I am glad they rectified there situation but it was still annoying.",

Bonus is that it shaves off a few calories. Plus it's available in personal size. I had the lunch duo and the salad was delicious. No boring \"house salads\" here. My coworker had a shrimp scampi dish that had both zoodles and regular pasta. She said it was a little watery but tasty. CPK gets extra kudos for having Certified Gluten-Free menu items, which is a rarity because of the expense and strict standards.",

Then because our food took so long they gave us a coupon for a free small plate on our next visit.  Um, we won't be going back.  They have changed their menu and not much remains. My pizza actually needed to be salted. That should not be.  I am so disappointed and by the number of people eating in there I wouldn't be surprised if they don't make it another year.  Service was not great. Food was mediocre at best. And it is WAY overpriced for what we got tonight. It is absurd!!! And I hate to say it,  we won't be back!",

There is a bar at the back of the restaurant that could've been an option as well. My waitress was excellent; extremely kind and personable. I ordered the Red Berry Sangria which was beautiful in color and taste. Between the Sangria and my pizza, my waitress brought out a small plate of bread and dipping oil. That dipping oil though...I wanted more and the recipe! I also wished I had more bread! I ended up using the dipping oil on the crust of my Five Cheese Tomato Pizza. The pizza was excellent as well. The blend of cheeses was something to remember. I'll definitely be back to try other drinks and pizzas on the menu. While I love tasty and unique independent restaurants, I'm never above a good chain restaurant.",

Service has, at times, left something to be desired, but every food item I have had here has been tasty, especially for a chain. Consistency in food is something this particular location does well, which is always important.   Non-pizza items I have enjoyed: asparagus & arugula salad, bianco flatbread (ok, sort of pizza-y), chicken lettuce wraps, California fields salad (Fresh watermelon, strawberries and field greens with our housemade Champagne vinaigrette, Feta, basil and California pistachios), oven-roasted turkey and brie sandwich (Roasted turkey breast, warm Brie, shaved Bosc pears and baby greens with housemade honey-mustard), and the California club sandwich. I like the option of the lunch duo (half sandwich or small pizza and choice of a cup of soup or salad) as well. Definitely a solid choice for lunch while at the mall!",

You know EPKs can be cool but this one never will be.  CPK is wickedly overpriced, for a start. It's popular in towns with sh** pizza like Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and Seattle. That should tell you a lot. It's some of the less good pizza I've had. It's actually more like NY Style, but a bad version of it. It's overpriced, overrated, and a corporate national chain taking business away from the little local places, such as in this case, Fiori's and Aiello's.  I don't get why people like it so much, but they do, so maybe you will too. All 3 of the people I ate it here in Pitt with, it was their first time trying it. It was not my first time. They all liked it. I never have. I still don't.",

We were greeted promptly by our server who was fantastic throughout the whole meal. Very courteous and attentive!  I started with a small plate of Asparagus + Arugula Salad which was too good to be only 180 calories. I love anything that's healthy and delicious! The vinaigrette was great - sweet but not overpowering. The Shaved Mushroom + Spinach Flatbread was tasty but average quality, in my opinion. It was very crispy and the veggies were cooked well, but it was a bit oily.   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal; however, I would agree that their food is overpriced for the quantity and quality. Sure, it's not the best food you'll ever taste in your life but it sure hits the spot if you need a quick pizza fix.",

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, but probably because we came in between lunch and dinner so I imagine we just missed the rush. We were seated by the entrance right by the host/hostess table and we could hear all the loud conversations of the recently out of school college kids who work there. Not ideal but you can't really blame them since it was a slow afternoon.  My husband and I each got our own pizzas. I got the Hawaiian and he got The Works, each around $15. The size of the pizzas were pretty large, but not large enough to share between two people. If you were to share a pie, I would highly recommend also getting appetizers. But getting a pie to yourself will probably be enough with maybe a few slices to take home. My favorite part of the pizza was the crust, which was thin, but not too thin, and crispy yet slightly chewy. Otherwise, the flavor was kind of average. For $15 a pie, I was expecting a bit more than average.   I enjoyed the pizza but probably not enough to justify spending that much. However, it's a nice option when you've spent a long day shopping and need a sit down meal.",

Both were good although the flavor of the fettuccini dish wasn't as light as it should have been.  Although it wasn't a cream sauce it came off as needlessly heavy. We wouldn't order that again.   Service: Initially was good until I received a refill that was a Diet Coke instead of regular. Then it took about 10 minutes to get my pizza boxed. But the worst part of the experience was paying for the check. Within minutes of initially sitting down I informed my waiter I would be using Mobile Pay, CPK's new feature where you can create a tab via the app and pay for your meal right from the table. He acknowledged it, I gave him the code to link to my tab in-app, and I thought we were set. Once we were finished, paid, then exited, he comes running out accusing (not asking) me of not paying. I told him I used the app, and he says, 'no, you didn't.' At this point I'm getting angry because 1) don't tell me what I didn't do. He may not have seen or been privy (even though he should have been), but he cannot attest to what I did. 2) I showed him the receipt in the app and all of a sudden it comes to him. It was embarrassing and never should have occurred.",
