Simple but excellent burritos that are better than the ones they serve at Round Corner Cantina (same owners). No frills, but delicious.  I'm a big fan of the shrimp burritos, but really, you can't go wrong with any of them. And very reasonably priced! Definitely get the chips... they aren't necessarily freshly fried right there and then, but they are definitely fried on premises, and are addictive.",

As a result, El Burro is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh and the epic poems I would write in honor of their rice, bean, and cheese burrito would feature whole stanzas about how delicious their rice is or how the only thing that comes close to comparing is their nachos with soyrizo. It may end with a battle between the nachos and burritos where everyone wins and celebrates with delicious and fresh Mexican food.  Also, El Burro needs to deliver to the East End so I can eat it all of the time and attain my wish of always having easy access to delicious burritos.",

Tasty.  The rice, bean and cheese burrito hit the spot.  I impulsively made the decision to drive over from the East End after work to check out this place.  Glad I did.  What you'll find when you get here is a small take-out establishment that's pretty bare bones both in terms of decor, space and menu options.  You could chose to sit and eat here, though I wouldn't plan on it during peak hours as seating is limited.  What it lacks in appearance and food variety is more than made up for in execution.  I found my burrito to be 1.) gigantic 2.) fresh 3.) incredibly tasty and 4.) nicely appointed with hot-sauce that was actually hot.  Woah.  I'm docking one star because there is an extra charge for guacamole on your burrito.  That's a bunch of BS.  For what it's worth, the guac is indeed amazing.  Some of the best I've had in the city.  Nevertheless, it's a crime to charge extra for such a thing, especially with a burrito that's already priced at $7.",

The beef chunks were cold, hard, and incredibly salty and it was basically like eating beef jerky in a sea of guacamole. The guacamole was full of onions and green bell peppers(?!) I couldn't finish it.   The salsa was good but all I had to put it on was the burrito. It didn't help the burrito at all.  I was disappointed. I had high hopes for this place given that I really enjoy the food at Round Corner Cantina and Mr. J's first visit here was followed by rave reviews. He was disappointed during this trip, as well.  Make sure you ask questions about the menu, otherwise you may get zinged as I did!",

    "text": "Thank God - actual street tacos here in Pittsburgh!  A friend caught this place on Yelp and got me and an officemate here for lunch.  What a great find.  I have been longing for street tacos since a couple of trips to Cancun and then finding a taco stand in Michigan of all places that did an amazing job with them.  Here, they are about $2.50 each and a choice of shredded beef, carne asada, shredded chicken, potato and chorizo.  I think I may have missed an option or two but they are perfect.  Just the right amount of meat, on two freshly made corn tortillas with a delicious pico de gallo and two hot sauces on the side with a slice of lime - you are set.    I got 3 street tacos (shredded beef, carne asade and shredded chicken) and a fountain drink for a little under $10.  Just the right amount of food and it was fast.  There are just a handful of seats and a lunch counter that runs all along the wall.  If you expect to eat in, get there before noon like we did.  Otherwise, not sure how the tacos will make the trip back to your home or office.  The others with me went with the burrito of shredded chicken and the extra $1 for guacamole.  They enjoyed their selection but both were a little disappointed with the light spread of guac on their burrito.  Other than that, this place was a crowdpleaser!  Maybe I'll branch out and try some of the other offerings.  But maybe not for a while until I get tired of their street tacos - this has been a long time coming to see a craving being satiated!",

The cheese was good but the beans were sort of off. I think they had a spice in them that I'm not used to being in refried beans. It reminded me of the beans at Tito's Tacos in LA. Not bad just sort of funky. I was super excited that they had Jarritos. yum.  My friend accidentally ordered a burrito with pico in it and when she realized she asked them, politely, if they could keep it off. Well it was already made and she was very apologetic but still asked if they could make another one. Obviously this sucks for them and they weren't rude about it but they did keep trying to get her to take the one with pico. I know it's a pain to have to remake something, I do get that, but it just started to get kind of weird. The kept saying, \"Are you sure you don't like pico? when was the last time you had it? Don't want to try it again?\" Yeah, she made a mistake and it's inconvenient and again, they weren't rude, but by the time he finally acquiesced he could have finished the burrito already.   It's an okay burrito but there's room for improvement.",

    "text": "My first trip to El Burro, my neighborhood's new burrito shop/taqueria, was this afternoon.  I won't say much about the speed and service, which wasn't the greatest in the world, because it's really only their first day open to the public.  They had a \"soft opening\" last night, and their full menu isn't even in production yet.  But it's worth waiting for them to work the kinks out because the food is FANTASTIC.  My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it.  It was gigantic. I got the rolled potato tacos (wanted street tacos, but they aren't yet available), and they ended up being AMAZING.  I was surprised when I opened my take-out container and found four giant taquitos smothered in guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese.  We also shared an order of chips and salsa.  Both are homemade.  Seriously, is there anything better than fresh, homemade tortilla chips straight out of the fryer?  I think not.  Heaven.  Their salsa is mild, with a cilantro-y kick.  I liked it, but ended up adding hot sauce.  Right now, this is pretty much take-out only, which is fine with me since it's a block from my house.  However, the inside of the restaurant is lined with bar counters so I think they will probably add stools eventually for an eat-in option, but even now, you could stand and eat at the counter if you wanted.  I am so, so excited to welcome El Burro to the neighborhood!  If you're on the north side, give them a try!",

I ended up going with the chorizo burrito with crumbly cheese and their habanero salsa. The burrito was underwhelming in my opinion. It's a tad pricey, has too much Spanish rice for filler, and minimal chorizo. Overall, it was a bit too bland and dry for me. Also, I'm not positive the cheese made it into my burrito. The habanero sauce was tasty though. It was not extremely hot and therefore manageable for anyone who likes some heat, but I only got enough on the side for half my burrito. I will try again at some point, but I'll be honest, I went to Chipotle for dinner to get the fix I was looking for later that day.",

The meat was seasoned differently than I'm used to (no heat or mild chili flavor, very little cumin or garlic, instead it was almost sweet and cinnamon-y). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't terribly flavorful. There were no beans or cheese inside, literally just bland rice and a tiny bit of Pico. This is as the menu described, but I somehow thought there had to be more to this burrito. It was pretty small considering it was almost $9. The hot salsa on the side was good, though, and made the burrito somewhat enjoyable.  I decided to try El Burro again, and ordered the California burrito, as it had many positive mentions on Yelp. This was not at all good. The \"carne\" was greasy, unseasoned hamburger meat. I mean, REALLY greasy, like pouring-all-over-the-place greasy. There were literally 3 fries on it, the cheese was somehow not melted, and the guacamole was the bland kind that makes me never want to eat guacamole again. The salsa Verde I got with this did little to add flavor.  I might try this place one more time, because it is one of the few options near where I work, and I want so badly to like it. I'll update my review if the tacos outshine the burritos.",

I got the soft shell version, which I would recommend considering the fish is already fried and crispy.  Fast and friendly service.  I also tried the carnitas, pulled beef, and pulled chicken tacos in the fried shell version.  All were pretty good, but not as wonderful or as large as the fish tacos.  Can't wait to head back for the best fish tacos I have found in Pittsburgh!!!  Probably not a place to dine with a large group, as the only place to sit is counter seating, but plenty of space for a few friends if they're not too busy.

While I do wish that someone would come up with another food inspiration, I can't help but understand why the taco is the obvious choice. A good tortilla can hold an endless amount of imaginative food combinations and, if done right, can really satisfy any hunger your body may encounter.  That being said, I have been hearing delicious things about El Burro for a really long time. Despite how often I'm in the Northside (read Parkhouse), I had yet to have gone until recently. Waiting this long was a huge mistake! All of these years I could have been feasting on delicious burritos and tacos instead of getting drinking ginger beers down the street! I had their special of the day which consisted of two chicken empanadas, rice and refried beans. The rice was ok. The beans were awesome and definitely fresh. But the empanadas were, by far, the best part. They were so simple and almost elegant. Chicken and cheese in a crispy corn meal shell, topped with lettuce and cilantro. There was also fresh (and very hot) salsa that made the meal perfect. Both myself and my guest devoured our meals in mere moments. I can't wait to go back and try more! This might become a problem. At least it's healthier than drugs.",

    "text": "Full disclosure, I have not actually been in the El Burro establishment - I've only had food delivered to my desk at work. I can't comment on the appearance or state of the actual building.  I CAN say, though, that wooooow, these guys make big things! It's a silly line to type, I know, but for my most recent meal I just ordered one burrito that was about $6 or $7, and it was massive - as big as and maybe bigger than a Chipotle burrito. I didn't even eat dinner that day, I was still so full from lunch!  I'd ordered the shredded beef burrito and I really liked it; the rice had been mixed in with vegetables that had been marinated in a mildly flavored sauce, so it had the teeniest of spicy kicks. I'm not a big spice person but I thought it was reasonable and mild enough that I still enjoyed it. My only complaint is that whoever made the burrito did not evenly distribute the meat. I bit into one corner and thought, \"Wow, I have a ton of shredded beef on this thing!\" And I was in heaven - that tangy beef mixing with the slightly spicy rice and veggies? Awesome! Alas, 3/4 to the end of the burrito, the meat trail ended, and I only found a few wisps of beef at the very end. It was still delicious eating the rice and veggies, but I would've loved to have a more even distribution of meat in that burrito since the beef was easily the best part of the whole ensemble.   Still, good food = I'm not going to gripe too much! Since people at work order here frequently I'm sure I'll have the chance to try more on this menu soon - if it's as good as the burrito was, I'm sure I won't have many complaints. I definitely recommend El Burro!",

California burrito is one of the best, but the burritos are all wonderful, and the tacos as well. They have some other menu items that are good too, like the Tj street dog, or the chilaquiles. I personally love the breakfast burrito with chorizo or bacon. Just found out recently you can get the burritos as a bowl, which I'll have to try more. Also, it seems like every other week they have a special that is vegan for those interested.  The price is a little more than you'd pay for chipotle, but it's also better. They have that new online order system which is pretty convenient. I wouldn't be concerned about them not following hours, that has never happened to me and I have been here many, many times.   Overall, it's a great local burrito joint that you have to try at some point. I'm getting hungry just thinking about all this.",

I've been here multiple times and often boast about its friendly owner and it's legitimately good tacos. I can't eat beans so I cannot attest for the burritos, but the tacos are on point. All of them. The only thing keeping this from five stars is the consistency in taste and quality. There will be times where the carne asada tacos are the best and times where they weren't as good(this goes for the churizzo as well). This often happens when the chef is \"eyeing up\" the recipe and not keeping it consistent, or when they have to quickly make a new batch because they ran out of the first. Those feeling aside, I would say the food is reasonably priced (would be perfect if they were consistent) and I would recommend El burro to anyone.  (Keep in mind North Shore can get shady at times so visiting during reasonable hours and with a friend is probably a good idea)",

    "text": "I'm from Southern California and my boyfriend lived in San Diego for a couple decades, so it's safe to say we have some pretty strong opinions on Mexican food. But my boyfriend actually grew up in Pittsburgh, so we make somewhat regular visits to see his family. Over the summer we were with his brother and needed lunch on the North Side. His brother took us to this place without really telling us anything about it. Imagine our surprise when we walked in and saw a menu plucked directly out of San Diego. It's all there: California burrito, carne asada fries, rolled tacos (the latter would be called taquitos nearly anywhere else). They even had a TJ hot dog on the menu--which is not necessarily a taco shop staple, but you'd see it at food stands in Tijuana and some SD shops had started incorporating it. And it's not just the menu items that were making us homesick--even the lettering was in True San Diego fashion.  On my first visit, I just ordered a bean and cheese burrito, which is comfort food to me. I basically hold it on par with grilled cheese sandwiches in terms of simple pleasures. And the burrito was pretty nice. It is weirdly difficult to find a decent bean and cheese burrito at a taco shop in Louisville. On that visit Matt got a couple of street tacos and a TJ hot dog. They were solid as well.  On our more recent visit Matt ordered carne asada fries. I asked for potato rolled tacos but they were out, and I wasn't feeling the other rolled taco options so I ordered a carnitas street taco, a carne asada street taco, and a shredded beef hard shell taco. The street tacos were nice. Good quality tortilla (corn, obvs), cilantro, onion. The carnitas wasn't the best ever but it was solid. I didn't like the carne asada though. It was a weird texture? And it kind of tasted like seasoning more than meat. Matt's fries were still amazing despite the mediocre meat. I pretty much only ever ordered carne asada fries while intoxicated but these were tasty sober. The carne asada just wasn't good enough to stand alone in a taco, but it worked with all the goodies on the fries. My hard shell taco was ordered on a whim; I hardly ever get hard shell tacos but I knew this place would make their own shells. It wasn't the greasy perfection for which I had hoped--I like a shell that is fried moments before consumption and still oily, which I guess is super bad for you so maybe it's better that's not what they do here. Anyway, I'm not going to fault them for that, because you really shouldn't order a hard taco at this place anyway.  Overall, although the carne asada itself was disappointing, the novelty of getting carne asada fries in Pittsburgh is enjoyable enough that this place gets a solid four stars from me. I also like that they have vegetarian and vegan items on the menu.",

The eggs in my breakfast burrito were extremely overcooked, and I didn't really like the pico de gallo... it was basically just some bland mushy tomatoes inside the burrito. Also didn't understand the sprinkling of clearly old, dried out chopped cilantro they put on top of the burrito.  It was also a pretty big hassle to get extra containers of salsa. The guy at the register pointed us to some sriracha sauce when we asked what their hottest salsa was, definitely not what I had in mind! I think it would be much better if they had a little salsa/toppings bar to let people serve themselves.",

However, I ordered the chorizo burrito with beans instead of rice and spicy salsa, Jeff ordered the same but with the rice.   $8 - ok, keep that in mind and an up charge for beans instead of rice. Canned, refried beans.   It showed up looking decent enough and fast food-y but maybe it was going to be great - nope.   First bite and I tried to chew but it was like doing the cinnamon challenge - google if you don't know this. It was literally SO dry I couldn't physically swallow it. I had to ask the gal at the counter for something wet to put on it - there's nothing you can do other than put more salsa on it.   So, I emptied the tortilla, mixed up the beans with the chorizo and ate the 1/3 cup of the interior of this blight.   I am a bodybuilder training for a competition and I had to eat something at that point but never ever again will I be going back. Sad to report.   Twice, homeless folks came in to beg as well which is fine but I think that it should be a concerted effort by management to keep their clientele comfortable when possible. I come from a big city and know this is part of a \"rough\" neighbourhood but it was kind of surprising that it seemed like it was commonplace for less fortunate folks to come in as a regular stop to ask people eating for cash.

Being New Years Eve day, we called first and the girl at the register told us they were closing in an hour, so we hightailed it over there and man we are glad we did!  My brother is a vegetarian and he was delighted to see the strictly veggie/vegan board on the wall. He got the veggie chilaquiles with fried egg and I got a hard shredded beef taco and soft carnitas taco. He loved his chilaquiles, it was too big to finish so he took it home and ate it before starting NYE partying. The meats in my tacos were delicious, tender and moist with great flavor with spices that didn't overwhelm the beefy/porky goodness.   Also got an order of chips, salsa, and guac...everything was super fresh! The salsa is very mild but still has flavor, and their specialty salsas have a kick! I got the medium and had a good tingle going on, while my bro got the habanero pineapple and devoured it while noting he'll regret it in the morning.  The service was wonderful, I wish I had caught the name of the girl at the register, because she was so nice and welcoming! Usually when you come in an hour before close, restaurant staff can get surly, but she was genuinely nice and explained various things on the menu. She even indulged my brother's need to wear the taco suit for a pic. If I'm ever back in the area, will definitely visit again!",

I went there a third time to get a potato rolled taco and they were out, and I was flustered because I'm vegan and gluten free and that was one of my go to foods. The cashier suggested a potato taco, since it was vegan and has a corn shell. I ordered what she suggested and added vegan cheese to it and it was honestly one of the most offensive things I've ever eaten. I received it cold first of all. It was just straight starch and nothing else. Half cooked potato chunks, the cheese wasn't even melted and there was barely any salsa on it. The potato chunks were so big you couldn't even bite the taco without most of the filling falling out. Weird pieces of corn were scattered throughout that easily could've been ANY other vegetable. Corn, potato chunks, and unmelted vegan cheese on a cold soft corn tortilla. I ended up eating the tacos with a fork before I couldn't even swallow anymore because the tacos were so dry and starchy. I just think it's ridiculous that you can have such an expansive menu for everything else but the second you try to make it vegan all of a sudden it needs to be dry and bare and half-assed.",

I've said it before and I'll say it again, but I think I could eat Mexican every day without getting tired of it... and I actually have had weeks that came pretty close to that being a reality. Oops.  I will admit that I am a newbie when it comes to the North Side. I am rarely there, with exception to a few visits to 21+ events at the Children's Museum, and visits to the Mattress Factory and the Aviary. I know very little about the food scene. My friend recommended that we try this place before going to look at cats at the Humane Society. Burritos AND cats all in one afternoon--this was a great day!  I had the chorizo burrito which included rice and pico, and I added sour cream. I also had the spicy salsa on the side. The burrito was huge! I was starving and did manage to finish it, but on a normal day I would definitely have had leftovers. The chorizo was spicy and packed with flavor. Everything tasted very fresh, even down to the sour cream. The salsa was very spicy (which I love), so I would recommend pico or the medium salsa if you're not a huge fan of spice.  The space is small but bright and clean. I'm excited to make a return trip to try some tacos!",

Carnitas has pretty strong ... cinnamon? Anise? That spice flavoring they probably used to marinate/braise the meat. Just..somewhat overpowering esp for someone who isn't a huge fan of cinnamon (ikik, im weird - dont like pumpkin spice latte for the same reason). I had to slather their hot salsa on the taco to mask that flavor.  Their sauces were rly good.",

    "text": "I stopped by with CM this past Sat. around 5pm after a visit to the Mattress Factory for a quick snack.  We were a bit hungry, but weren't necessarily up for a full dinner. I whipped out my trusty Yelp app and saw that El Burro was an establishment nearby that I'd bookmarked, and CM said he was up for Mexican. Thus, we decided to brave the quasi-sketchiness of this end of Federal St. to check it out.    The first thing that immediately became apparent upon walking in was that there were no tables--only a handful of counter seats on either side.  Between that and observing other customers, it's pretty clear that most of El Burro's business is take out.  Undaunted, we decided to get a few tacos and settle in to eat them at the counter.  CM and I both ordered two chicken tacos in hard shells ($3.75 each), and I also got a bottle of Tamarind El Jarritos soda ($2.29).  The tacos were served about 5 min. after ordering.  Unfortunately, though they had appropriate textural variation, I found them bland in flavor.  The skimpy portion of red salsa served on the side, while hot, added little flavor to them.  No guac or sour cream was included, which was disappointing--apparently, you have to pay extra for it.   Unfortunately, I feel that El Burro epitomizes what's wrong with the Mexican food scene in PGH--Mexican food is supposed to be bold and flavorful, not bland!  Between the blandness of the tacos and the price that we paid (over $16), it just wasn't worth it.  In retrospect, after looking at the photos, we would have been better off ordering two flying saucers instead of the tacos.  If you're looking for delicious, inexpensive tacos, I recommend Edgar's in the Strip or Las Palmas in Oakland.  TBH, I probably wouldn't return unless someone insisted on it--or unless I was stuck in the North Side without cash, as was the case on Sat.",

Carne asada burrito was full of onions from guacamole and the meat chunks were chewy, tasteless and too big  The fresh salsa was made from  un ripened tomatoes, had no heat or cilantro   Too bad the $8 per burrito locks you into buying the whole thing.  Casta rasa, round corner cantina and the taco stand in front of Reyna foods has way better casual tacos  They charge for chips and salsa.

Also, I'm not a fan of food made \"pittsburgh,\" which apparently literally just means you add french fries to something that doesn't need it. Yet, if you ask them for any sort of vegetable they are VEHEMENTLY against that sort of addition. What type of mex-american place doesn't have at least sauteed onions and peppers? Again, this place is fine - especially for the north side - but if I didn't live a few blocks away I would never seek it out. If I'm going to get white people Mexican food I might as well choose Chipotle, where I know the ingredients are responsibly sourced and they have a standard of consistency. Also, it's not cheap. It's not expensive, but the prices are like panera or chipotle or any other chain. Again, eh.",

Not great but good enough. Then the quality started to slip.  Burritos were sometimes too greasy, not every time but too often. The consistency in quality is nonexistent. One time the beans are super and the next time they have no seasoning at all.  More often then not the beans are in the bottom and everything else is in the top. Their Carne is of poor quality with a lot of gristle. The chile relleno tonight was not lightly battered and deep fried like usual. There was a big gloppy  mess of  batter in the bottom of my burrito not even attached to the pepper which was of course in the top of the burrito.  I had to return while my whole family was eating at home to get my money back and the cook felt he could justify why I was sent home with a really poor quality burrito instead of just apologizing and saying that the issue would be corrected in the future.",

I had the shrimp diablo burrito, which I've had in the past, but this time it was just kind of meh. The carnitas tacos were still delicious however, and the guacamole is quite good. The chips are way too greasy in my opinion, but that's not super surprising since they're homemade. In the future, I think I'd stick to the tacos here, rather than the namesake burritos.",

    "text": "I'd like to make my deep love for El Burro known. I would write love letters to these incredible tacos if I wasn't fearful of spilling salsa on them. What a fantastic neighborhood find, thanks again to Yelp! Lots of vegetarian choices and variations of those choices. The potato tacos are mouth watering, with flaky flour tortillas, fresh veggies, and chunks of potatoes cooked in some magical spice that makes me crave them nightly. The rolled potato tacos are a surprisingly huge portion of 4 taquito type goodies with loads of cheese and fresh pico. There are tons of different burrito options, I think 11 in all, many vegetarian or having veggie friendly possibilities. Oh, and some have french fries, which makes my inner fat kid squeal with delight and feel naughty at the same time. I adore that they have vegan chorizo and the breakfast burrito is definitely worth tasting, even though those potato tacos are difficult to pass up!  El Burro has the best salsa I've ever tasted. I guess this is controversial since other reviewers seem to find it too thin or even runny. I don't care about chunks, apparently, just flavor. And this stuff has it! Perfect amount of kick to compliment those homemade chips. The guacamole is good, although they don't give you much of it on the side. They carry Mexican Coke (sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup) and other south of the border bottled beverages which only adds to the El Burro vibe and experience. This is primarily a take out joint, although I suppose you could eat there if you wanted. There just isn't much seating, just a handful of stools at a couple counters. Order at the counter or call ahead. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. And it's cheap! $2.95 per taco, $5-$6 for rolled tacos, $6.95 for burritos, $2.95 for chips and a huge container of salsa.  I'm so delighted to have El Burro as my new neighbor. Definitely crave-worthy food has come to Federal Street, and I could not be happier!",

    "text": "This is one of those places where I have been dying to try but the random 1 & 2 star reviews people have deterred me from making it a point to make a trip to the North Side to do so. Now, after actually being a block away and starving after a long day at AGH, I want to kick myself for putting it off.  This place is small, not air conditioned and with not a whole lot of seating.  You order at the counter and then they call you up when food is ready - maybe not the best place for a sit down date, but the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to get amazing taco takeout and stuff our faces in the comfort of our own home.  The menu is on a chalkboard behind the register.  I opted for the mahi mahi street tacos, chips and salsa and a side of guac.  My food was ready in about 5 minutes and I always say Las Palmas has my favorite tacos in Pgh (ok I said this about round corner cantinas tacos too) and I want to kick myself again for making that claim now that I've tried El Burro's fish taco.  It was served on a white corn tortilla with cabbage, cilantro and a creamy white sauce with lime on the side.  I added their salsa which I thought was a little bit smokey and their guac that was clearly fresh.  It was perfect mix of flavors and texture.  The man working the counter was very friendly.  The prices aren't as cheap as Las Palmas, but from my first time here, I have no problem paying.  I can't wait to go back this weekend.  I'm Tori and I have a taco problem.",

The woman at the register was very confused about her customers order. She kept asking him to repeat it, I think she was writing up his invoice. She was doing math on a piece of paper, next to the cash register and it took her about 10 minutes. She didn't acknowledge anybody in line behind him. As the line didn't move and no one else was helping, I left and went to Pizza Badamo next door.  I ordered two slices, waited till they heated them up. Spent less than half that I would have on my tacos, and was in and out before the next person in line was waited on.",

With so many excellent restaurants within walking distance to choose from, none posed a more welcome threat than El Burro.  Burritos. That's what you need to know about El Burro. They serve a wide array of burritos including Carne Asada, Chile Relleno and breakfast. They also offer vegetarian and vegan options, which never, ever skimp on the flavor. My go to, despite never being vegetarian or vegan, is the vegan chorizo burrito. Magical, filling and oh so delicious. Include some of their in-house hot sauce and you're set.  Not in the mood for a burrito? No problem. They also offer an array of tacos (both street and crunchy,) Tons of delicious sides including chips and guac that will change your life, and the elusive Tijuana Street Dog, a hot dog wrapped in bacon, topped with queso fresco, avocado salsa, pico de gallo, and jalapenos. The prices are good and the service has always been, without exception, excellent, fast and friendly.  El Burro, my friends, is worth the trip. Always.",

It was more like a greasy rolled corn tortilla the size of a taquito.  El Burro is a small, hole in the wall, Mexican street food inspired type of restaurant.   Seating is limited so this is more of a grab and go place.  But if you choose to stick around you're transported by the authentic art and community events adorning the walls.

No frijoles on a burrito should be a crime! So: white rice and dry pork and some tomatoes. Just awful. After tax and tip it was $11. The decor tricks you into thinking you're going to get good, cheap southwestern street food, and it's very deceiving. I'm not going back to see if their tacos are any good.",

As far as seating goes, there's not many options, but it's perfect if you're looking to get a quick and super casual bite.   The staff was very friendly!

The wait was a little over 5 minutes ..but it went fast..  took some pics of the cute-themed decor - sent some texts and then my order was up.  Your first name is called out for each order which adds a personal touch.  I tried the chicken and beef soft taco.  They both were equally delicious.  It was a light meal. The hard/soft tacos are not too large in size- rather small.  The meat was slightly on the dry side, however; after a spritz of lime (that was provided) and a little hot sauce.. my taste buds were singing.   When I arrived I was able to find parking right in front but when I left which was a little after Noon there wasn't a parking spot in sight.   El Burro offers little bit of counter seating along the walls - but not really \"dine in\".  The homemade salsa was fresh and flavorful.  The menu has something for everyone... even for vegan lovers!  And get this.. even French fries are even on the menu... I just love that!   I can't wait to go back and try something else.

The food was very tasty but the portions were so tiny; I have Dachshund and I think even he would bark about the portions. Honestly guys I could eat 15-20 of these tacos no problem.   If you are down to drop $30 on tacos you could probably leave this joint without being hungry.  I actually went to chipotle 20 minutes after this meal because my three tacos were so unfulfilling.  I hate to leave a two star review for a place that served delicious food, but the portions were microscopic and the prices were astronomical.    Not a good value, overhyped, and overrated.  If you want an authentic taco, you are better off taking a trip up the road to the Strip district!",

    "text": "I got the shrimp taco, the shreddded beef taco, and the carnitas taco.  The shrimp was well cooked, but i didnt like the flavor of the taco at all. It had a warm, somewhat spicy salsa and grilled bell peppers. It made the tortilla soggy.  I couldn't tell which one was carnitas and which one was shredded beef, but one of them was very good and one of them was very ok. Both of them had a lot of meat and the traditional cilantro and onions on it. The tortillas on these didn't get soggy.  Overall, i found the tacos to be a little disappointing aside from the one unidentified taco. The burritos look good though, so i want to come back and try one.  Edit: The shrimp taco is served fajita style, so everything makes perfect sense. I guess that's just not my style. The one on the far right of my picture was the one I liked a lot, and it turns out that that was the carnitas taco.  Edit: Upgrading to 4 stars because the burritos are fire. I got a california with carnitas. The juicy meat with the rich guac and fries plus tangy cheese and salsa in a chewy tortilla with a grilled crispy exterior? Great burrito! I didnt like the TJ dog too much though.",

    "text": "I went to undergrad in San Diego so I know my burritos. Carne asada to me means one thing only: grilled steak, pico de gallo, and guac! This holy trifecta is what defines a carne asada burrito, and, due to the simplicity of the components, each one must be prepared and executed perfectly. At El Burro, the tortilla lacks the chewy freshness I would normally expect in a burrito and the steak is too tough -- likely because they use the wrong cut. However, the salsas are pretty good and I always have to remember not to compare the best burritos in the world to the ones in Pittsburgh. El Burro gets a 3 from me because although I would choose Chipotle over it on most days, sometimes I want a slightly more authentic experience which El Burro provides. Also, there is a nice park across the street which offers a nice place to enjoy the burritos.",

The portions are pretty sweet and could probably feed two people. I got the potato tacos as I don't eat beef or pork and wasn't in the mood for meat. Their vegan/vegetarian menu is impressive. But back to the tacos at hand, they were good. On Tuesdays they have a Taco special. The flavor in the tacos were there. I've just tried a lot of veggie tacos and I know what to expect. The potatoes were a bit spicy (love it) and the corn was a good. I know the tacos were supposed to be the star but I really really liked their rice and beans. The customer service was awesome, the atmosphere was quaint and it didn't take long to get my food. Will I be back to try a different vegetarian option or a shrimp taco? Most definitely! It's definitely a not so hidden gem.",

I was in the neighborhood and stumbled upon El Burro using the 'nearby' feature on Yelp. I visited on a warm, sunny, Saturday and the door and windows were open, resulting in a nice breeze throughout the small restaurant. There is not a whole lot of space there, so if you are coming with a big group I would suggest getting your order to go. Also, there are no tables, just counters, so keep that in mind. Anyway, I chose to keep it simple with the bean and cheese burrito. I added tomatoes and lettuce (no charge) and cream cheese (50 cent charge). Several other toppings are available for a la carte charges.   The service was inviting and quick, and I really enjoyed the burrito. For $8, I got a large burrito and fountain pop. In the future, I would probably get the tomatoes on the side, as it resulted in the burrito being a little too \"wet,\" but all in all, a delicious lunch!",

Though gave it 5 stars, I will must warn you... There are a lot of homeless people congregating and drinking on the street. One of which came in the restaurant, attempting to get a free meal.

So I know from my burritos and tacos.  I opted for the special burrito, a chile relleno.  I was pleasantly surprised by how big, filling, and delicious it was.  Also, when I see a burrito that has that nice translucent property when its heated, I get excited.  That means I'm going to get a nice, chewy experience.  I also had the chips and guacamole.  The price point on the latter was pretty high for the serving size, I think.  As is the jump from the smaller to the larger size--I'd consider what they call a large a medium.  And it was pricey.  It was at least decent guac, and the chips were admittedly greasy, but that's not necessarily a turn-off for me.  Especially since it was clear that they were made in-house.  The space is cute because they definitely keep with the Burro theme, as they are all over the restaurant.  It's small and casual; just counter seating. So it's a great place to end a night, or start one where you want to eat well for cheap and them move on to someplace else like my date and I did, haha.  If I lived closer, I could see myself coming here regularly.",

I stopped in here one day so I could basically grab and go.  This place, at least to me, that is what you should do.  You can eat inside, but it's not your typical restaurant.  There is a bar like area along the wall with stools, but if you are expecting to have a full meal here comfortably, it's not going to happen.    After struggling with the menu, and not in a bad way, I finally made my choice on what I wanted.  I needed a burrito.  There are plenty of different types of burritos here that you can come back everyday of the week and still have a new adventure each day.  Just to be safe I asked what the tortilla was made from...flour if you are wondering.  I went with the shredded beef burrito which, if you were wondering, is much better than a ground beef burrito.  With this you get rice and pico.  Now, just so you know, this will have corn in it.  Not a problem for some of you, but it is for me as I have an allergy to it.  I even mentioned that I had this allergy when ordering.  But I suffered through it anyway.  It was that good.  I suppose you could gauge how good it was if I was going to take the risk of having to use my epi-pen.  Would I attempt this again, absolutely, but I do not advise to others.

The prices here are also pretty reasonable (about $8 for a burrito, $5 for chips and salsa). The chips, albeit cheap, are extremely oily and don't do much to enhance the burrito experience. I do like their homemade mild salsa, which tastes really fresh and has a great color as well as texture. I wish they could put a bit more salsa in the burritos, however, because they are served a bit on the dry side.  The tortilla has more of a bite to it than most other flour tortillas and I wish they incorporated a bit more moisture when they heat them up. The other complaint is the carne asada burrito I had included a lot of steak pieces that still had tendon in them so that ruined the texture a bit for me.  Overall, this place is deserving of 3-stars for the value and for existing in a Mexican food-barren Pittsburgh.",

The vegan chorizo itself had no heat to it.  The burrito is mostly white rice that is not seasoned.  Tiny amount of pico de gallo, and a little bit of shredded carrots.  The hot sauce was very nice, with a hint of habanero without being too hot.  Not sure I would go back, but I may try a different menu item for comparison.",

Adding beans are an up charge of .50 the carnitas burrito is cheaper did not receive the difference. Then the chorizo burrito also added beans for .50 did not get any beans but paid for them. The chili relleno burrito was good so out of all three burritos one was correct and good.. look I would over look the .50 thing but it's adds up they could have offered chips and salsa or something... anyway being from California I just wanted a really good burrito that reminded me of home ...

    "text": "A great place to pig out. I came here with my family and we got to try a bit of everything - calif burrito, shrimp diablo burrito, chilaquiles, carne asada fries, and a chorizo taco. everything was great and the portions were huge. We got way too much food for the four of us. Standouts were the calif burrito (yes it has fries!) and the carne asade fries, which were fries loaded up like nachos.  They also had a bunch of salsas ranging in spiciness and they were all really fresh and good! There's a array of sodas, but it's BYO for beer and such.  The space is small and there's no wait service, but the person working was very sweet and attentive. She actually even spoke Chinese, which my Chinese parents thought was very cool haha.  I definitely recommend this place and look forward to coming back some time!",

    "text": "They used to have the best steak tacos in Pittsburgh until they swapped out the real chunks of steak to basically Taco Bell meat. I was extremely disappointed when I learned of this transition. I actually have not returned since... Dont get me wrong, the tacos are top notch. I love the soft greasy shells and the authentic Mexican feel this place has. They also give you lime for the tacos which gives it that extra zesty taste! I also have had the pittsburgh burrito which has french fries mixed in with the burrito, it was ok but when I go to a place like this I am looking for as authentic as I can get. Still good food besides substituting the best tacos they had. I have to give it 3 stars because that was the only thing I really kept me coming back. Disappointed :-/",

Yes, it's a little pricey...but if you want cheap/mediocre/quasi-Mexican, you should go to Taco Bell around the corner.  My favorites:  shredded beef hard shell tacos, shrimp diablo burrito, and the carne asada fries.  I don't mind that there's only counter seating - Federal Street is not somewhere you want to sit and eat, anyway (not much in the way of a view and there's still some sketchy characters roaming about - the area is improving greatly and undergoing a renaissance of sorts).  I always phone in my order and pick it up on my way home from work.  I've never waited and never had a wrong/messed up order.  It's consistently fresh and yummy :-)  So glad El Burro is in my neighborhood!",

They could have really perked this place up with a sit-in area- however, obviously the space is small and carry-out is pretty much the only way to go here. I have to say the food was good, but as other people have said the quality is not much of a step-up compared to the Taco Bell down the road. I got a rice and beans burrito, which was almost 6 bucks. The fact that even lettuce and tomato are extra ad-ons is ridiculous. I don't think I've ever seen that in any comparable food chain/restaurant. As other people have said as well, the people behind the counter were not very friendly. There is a fine line between fast service with no bullshit attitude and rudeness, and the couple of people who took my order there were right on the line. I do have to recommend trying their home-made salsa that they offered me, although there is almost no spice to it. Bottom line, one should go to the Taco Bell a few blocks away for similar quality food at a cheaper price.",

    "text": "Meh. That's my description based on my first visit. I have been wanting to try El Burro for quite a while since the place is literally just a few blocks away. I love LOVE Mexican food. Usually you can find me salivating over the menus of Casa Renya, El Campesino, Chipotle, etc. You get the point.  I finally tried it out this afternoon for lunch and decided on the Carnitas Burrito. My significant other ordered the chile relleno burrito. Upon holding the burrito, I was impressed - it felt like a significant portion. When I took it out of the foil it looked good, lightly grilled even, and smelled nice. Then I cut it in half, and rice spilled out everywhere. I looked - where's the meat? Upon further inspection and subsequent eating I found the meat, but not very much. And to boot - it tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all. Very bland. All that weight of the burrito? Pretty much all white rice with a couple of corn kernels and peas and TWO cilantro leaves.... And it all tasted like... well, nothing! I had to drown it in my hot sauce here at home.  At other establishments I can barely eat an entire burrito. Here, I ate the whole thing and was very disappointed, especially after reading all these rave reviews and the price point. Now, I did have a bite of my husband's Chile Relleno burrito, and it was more flavorful than mine, but of course a pepper like that is going to have more flavor than what I had. He said it was just ok, and that for the price he expected a bit more inside the burrito other than the mass quantity of rice. I don't see myself being a regular here. Too pricy for too much rice and very little flavor.",

I got home and opened the bag to see the chips were drenched in oil. I mean like everytime I touched a chip my fingers were glistening! I will post a pick of the bag of chips an 2hours later. i love homemade chips but they need to lay these out in a draining bin before they bag them. Very disappointing.

    "text": "My husband ate here once before, probably almost a year ago.  He seemed impressed then, so I figured we'd give it a try for dinner.  My husband got the carne asada burrito, and I got chicken tacos.  We also shared chips and salsa, which I think should come free with the meal, considering how expensive it is for the lack in quality and quantity.  Looking back, I wish we would have had Taco Bell for dinner, and that's saying something.  I ordered three chicken tacos, and didn't even finish one.  The soft shell was bland, as was the chicken and onions.  The chicken also tasted like it had been reheated.  It was not fresh at all.  The only thing I could really taste was cilantro.  It was just too much.  I took off as much as I could, and it was still quite gross.  Thankfully we got the chips because that ended up being my dinner.  It's just too bad that I ended up getting sick about an hour after I ate.  The chips were so greasy and the salsa was like water.  It had almost no flavor.  I took one bite of the burrito my husband got, and it was okay.  It just tasted like guacamole, which was probably the best part of the whole experience.  The worst part is when my husband ate my last two tacos for me and bit into a bone.  It was at least about an inch long.  One of us could have easily chipped a tooth or choked on that.  I gagged when he set the bone down on the table.  I've never written a review before on any restaurant, but I figured I should at least warn customers to check their food before they eat it.  I'm just really disappointed, as I have lived in the neighborhood for almost seven years, and want to support local businesses.  My husband and I will never eat there again.",

It's within walking distance from my office and the perfect little treat for when I am lazy over the weekend and don't manage to pack anything for lunch.   It's very small inside. There's some seating along the walls and the window facing the street but it's all bar seating and there are no tables. You order at the counter. I got the California burrito - fulled with shredded steak, pico, cheese, guacamole, and French fries. It came quickly and I tossed it in my purse to walk back to the office. You have the option to eat there but I wasn't in the mood. They normally ask you if you want some salsa to go but I had to ask, they're the two little containers you can see in my pictures. Definitely a must. I also recommend asking for a fork and knife - this is one of those burritos that you'll need it for.   When I got back to the office and cut the burrito in half, I was so delighted by the bright, beautiful colors of the vegetables inside. The burrito tasted just as good as it looked. I wanted to some for later but I couldn't resist and ate the whole thing in a sitting.   My coworker got the chips and salsa as well. They were so good. The chips are greasy but freshly made. Honestly some of the best I've ever had and a new standard for tortilla chips in my book. The salsa was fresh and tasty - not spicy, and there's more than enough to share. I highly recommend the chips.   I'll be back for another easy lunch one day soon!",

Adorned in Mexican cultural items on the walls and classic mariachi music on the speakers, the place screams authenticity and I did not catch a \"gimmicky\" feel.   Carne Asada taco: 2.4/5 The meat was super dry and totally lacked any carne asada flavor. Just seemed like overlooked dry chipped beef. There was a decent cream sauce on it.   Chorizo taco: 2.9/5 Proper chorizo taste with another kind of sauce but otherwise underwhelming again. Standard by all means.  Value: 3.2/5 So you get a good amount of meat on the tacos and while they are $3.50 each, the taste doesn't do it for me. $7 for two tacos was fair and I left hungry, but I didn't enjoy as much as I would have liked.",

I do like their habanero sauce(spicy fresh and a little sweet)  They took out the Carne Asada taco, I remember it was my favorite when I came back to Pittsburgh in December. But since it's so close to the house it was an easy place to get Tacos. I moved to Arizona, so I have found way too many authentic mexican street food that are better.   Will give this place another try when I come back to visit though!",

I loved the shredded chicken tacos.  Being from California I have very high taco standards, and the chicken were very flavorful and a little spicy - right up my alley!  My husband and I agreed the carne asada was lacking flavor but the chips & gauc and all the salsa were really great! (We tried all three: rojo, verde, and habanero).  If we're in the north shore and craving tacos, we'd definitely be back.  Overall two thumbs up!",

It was a little challenging to order because they essentially ask you the same question twice in regard to the toppings for the burritos but regardless our food was processed and delivered quickly.  We both ordered the carne asado burrito with chips and salsa. The chips were greasy and the salsa was bland. My carne was so salty it was inedible. It also may have been over cooked because it was quite dry. I'm really only giving 2 stars because the tortilla was chewy and crispy on the outside which I always look for in a burrito.  Maybe it was a bad batch, but I can't imagine I'll be ordering again any time soon. Bummer",

It was pretty good, but had more cheese than I cared and there was an element of friedness. It was quite heavy and a filling option. By dinner time, I still wasn't hungry.   Tip: there are several hot sauce varieties on the table, but not salsa. I didn't get any for my burrito. Hubs got two small containers of hot salsa for his tacos.  The spot itself is small, with various barstool spots. It is better suited for grab and go.",

First, the fact that they have many options including vegetarian and vegan in this little place is amazing. Then, let's talk about the way they crank food out FAST so that you don't have to wait in hunger. Now onto the food... I ordered a chicken taco and the carne asada fries. The taco could've used some cheese but authentic Mexican style is usually just onions and cilantro which is how they did it. It was a tiny bit spicy but I still liked it. But the carne asada fries.... I ate every bite until I was sick. It was loaded to perfection with meat, cheese, pico, jalapenos, and just enough of sour cream. It was amazing. My sister got a burrito with vegan chorizo and she loved it, but after watching me eat the loaded fries, she wished she would've gotten them too with the vegan chorizo substituted. And they are flexible about changing ingredients! Lastly we got chips and guacamole, both of which were amazing! The guacamole is a good size so I might invest in 2 bags of tasty chips next time. There are only 4 chairs in the restaurant so we took it home to eat, but I wasn't mad about that at all. I will definitely be going back!",

El Burro is a small little taco shop.  Window seating and wall seating (holds about ten people total). $3.25 for a taco which is a little pricey in my book.  They were all out of carne asada tacos so I had one shredded beef and one potato taco.  They were both very bland.  The potatoes had no seasoning. It tasted like someone literally just chopped and steamed potatoes. I love onion on my tacos but they put way to big of a scoop of raw yellow onions.  So definitely not fond of the potato taco.  The shredded beef taco was just okay. Nothing special, like I said before, it needed way for seasoning.  Oh boy the salsa.  Sadly their homemade red salsa was not good. It tasted like pureed canned tomatoes with a hint of spice.  I really really wanted some good tacos and sadly this place just didn't measure up.  Of course I will give it another try, need to have the carne asada tacos.  Hopefully they were just having an off day!",

    "text": "LOVE. Seriously, this place is delish.  We've been eating El Burro once a week for the last couple of months and we're not even close to being sick of it - if anything, we're becoming even more addicted.  The breakfast burrito (with chorizo added) is the most insanely delicious thing I've eaten in a long time - eggs, a few fries (because why not?) salsa, spicy chorizo, all wrapped in a tasty tortilla. Rich and filling enough to share.   The chicken soft tacos are consistently good, with slow-cooked white and dark meat and a thick green sauce. Topped with onions and cilantro, the only thing that makes them better is a squeeze from the lime wedge that comes alongside.  Finally, the chips and salsa steal the show, in my opinion. Chips are actual deep-fried flour tortillas (presumably their leftovers) with just the right amount of salt. They're flakey and oily and oh so good. The salsa is thin (which I love) and bright and fresh tasting - a good counterpoint to the richness of the chip.  Highly recommended. Local delivery service is a bonus for those of us living on the North Side.",

If it's your first time, I recommend the carne asada fries. Parking could be better, but honestly it's not big deal to drop a few quarters to feed a meter.  They also do large orders, which is great for parties. I recently called in for 80 tacos and that fed about 30-35 people. They hooked it up with bags of chips and three big tubs of salsa. It was a big hit and I plan on doing it again.  It's been a little slow my past few visits. Hopefully I was just there on off days and we don't see any change in portion size or food quality.",

The older recipe nicely combined soft corn tortillas with fresh sweet corn, succulent shrimp, and cilantro. These new ones are apparently a \"fajita style taco\" (huh?)  loaded with greasy fried onions, bitter peppers, and lime wedges. It's an assault to the taste buds, very unappealing, and nonsensical.",

SO delicious. We also really enjoyed the vegan chorizo burrito and the sweet potato and cauliflower tacos. We asked for recommendations from the vegan menu, and we were not steered wrong. Excellent customer service too - I wanted to order one item, and the person said that that particular item was not that great that day, so maybe try something else. Talk about great service. It was clear she wanted us to have a good meal we'd enjoy. We missed from the website that it is a counter-service type restaurant, so be aware of that when you go. And you should definitely go.  We were visiting from out of town, and mostly tried vegan places, but we were drawn to El Burro for its interesting vegan menu. We were not disappointed.",

Mine was not freshly made, perhaps since I stopped in shortly after three, so I excuse that a little. That aside, I immediately took notice of the fake shredded cheese they use. The meat did have good flavor, the guac was fine, and I did like their salsa verde. For a mediocre burrito, I'm most taken aback by the price: nine bucks for a pretty small burrito! I noticed two tacos were the same price, which I thought there's no way two tacos would be that much. After what I received, I fear that might be exactly what you get. I've had much better for half the price! I'll come back if I'm desperate, but otherwise would get more bang for my buck elsewhere.",

It was--literally--80% rice and very little meat. Totally dry, hardly any pico, and the little meat that was there was not carnitas.  Also had rolled tacos...which are actually taquitos.  Fried to the point of very, very well done. Did not come with the avocado that was advertised.   The regular $3 tacos are solid, but the other stuff is overpriced and barely mediocre. $25 for two meals, thought we might get chips or salsa as well, but nothin.

The burritos are huge and filling, especially the California, which is stuffed with fries among the other goods.  Cons: -I think it's a little overpriced. The cheapest, most basic burrito (bean & cheese) starts at $5.49, and that's without frills like rice, guacamole, etc. Most of the items are over $7, with my favorites costing $8.49. A small side of guac is $1.49, and pretty standard sides (like sour cream) are also extra. I don't know where they get their ingredients from, but I could see this being justified if they're working with local providers. I know they're a small business and I'm not expecting chain restaurant prices, so I'm happy to support them regardless. I just can't eat here nearly as much as I'd like!  -Call ahead during the lunch rush; it get's pretty busy during the week, and it's pretty much a standing-room-only venue anyway.  -In my experience, they run out of carne asada on a regular basis--sometimes early in the lunch hours.  But the giant PRO is that it's delicious. Check their Facebook page for daily specials.",

The rice is on the harder side, for that better mouth feel. The meats are so well cooked and seasoned. The veggies are crisp!  Wes is one of the owners of the shop and he's very friendly and expedient. He'll recommend a few good hot sauces he has for you to try with the burrito.  The burritos here are definitely not on the heavy & sloppy side - they're not loaded with cheese or fats just to get flavour in. No, everything is prepared in a super clean-tasting way that I just would never expect when I have a burrito. Would definietly come back here when I visit Pittsburgh again.",

    "text": "I got two words. \"Tijuana. Hotdog.\" It is a delightful, gravity defying, awe inspiring, bacon wrapped pork stick, deep fried, and lovingly dressed with diced tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos.  I shared one with my wife, thinking that it would be too heavy and greasy to have along with my meal.   I deeply regret offering to do so.    It was so good I wanted it all to myself!  I expected to fall into a deep coma after eating it, but I felt energetic and lively.  Could it have been the bacon induced hypertension kicking it?  Quite possibly, but it tasted much lighter and less greasy than I would have expected.  I also enjoyed a shrimp diablo burrito and my wife got fish tacos which were all excellent.  Normally  I associate Sriracha with asian food.  My shrimp weren't as spicy as their name would suggest, so I gave their Sriracha a try and it complemented the Mexican food perfectly.  They also have house made sauces which were good, but get a few as the containers are small.  It's a bit of a hole, light on atmosphere, but generous with great freshly made, inventive Mexican food, low prices, friendly knowledgeable staff, and every reason to come again soon.  Only a donkey would not love El Burro!",

Were they trying to skimp out on ingredients and make their product last longer, or the salsa was not refrigerated and just went bad? Who knows...",

If you like the sort of taco you'd get in the southwest or in mexico--I'm pretty sure you will like these.  If you're expecting tacos to be dirt cheap, pre-made, and have a pile of random shredded extras on them, you may be happier at the taco bell a mile or so away. (Or get a burrito. It's 6 hours since I ate one, and I'm still comfortably full.)  I'm told some of the veg options are also pretty good (though others are a bit bland until you dose them generously with the excellent salsa). Did I mention the salsa? (And real guac.)",

Food is either very good (with the addition of their hottest salsa) or just average. This last trip, we both got the California burrito and enjoyed it. Lots of steak that was flavorful and juicy. Neither of us could finish it. But their sizes seem to be inconsistent depending on who is in the kitchen. Their rolled tacos are also good. Only 3 stars because I think with Tako and Condado opening, El Burro's prices just don't match the flavors. $8 for a container of guacamole at a takeout place is a little crazy. Also, it'd be great if they had a list of their salsas on the menu - I think people are missing out on some of the spicy options that add flavor.",

But something is different. Maybe it's that I can actually see my taco (considering it's so freakin' dark in Cantina!). Maybe it's that they seem a little bigger. Or a little more thought thrown into them. I don't know... but they may have been even better!  I ordered the shrimp tacos in a pair for $8 and they were just fresh and grilled perfectly. With incredible corn tortillas. Drool. Best decision I made (along with my taco choice) was getting the chips, salsa and gauc. Oh man. It's a huge portion!

El Burro caters to that deep longing that every burrito lover has yet doesn't know exists. El Burro makes Qdoba laughable, puts Chipotle to shame, and hits you smack in the face with what a real burrito should taste like. The guy who runs the place makes his own hot sauces, which are pretty dope. If you need hotter, he buys some pretty good hot sauces you can use, too. The carne asada French fries come loaded with everything you didn't know you wanted on French fries, and the chips are fresh and delicious.  Now, it isn't the Mission or anything, but it's damn reminiscent. And if you don't want a pop with corn syrup, they also sell Mexican Coke (made with cane sugar for that real, rot-your-teeth-in-the-best-ways adventure).",

Chips/salsa the bomb. His carne asada burrito amazing. My potato tacos delicious.   The second time we went my husband ordered the same exact burrito - carne asada. The meat was not the same. It was a ground meat? We asked about it and they said they had recently changed it.   I went back today. For a business lunch order. 6 people. I ordered a little bit of everything, which included two orders of chips and salsa and five orders of guacamole. They did not send the chips/salsa or guac, or plates, silverware, napkins etc. Since the meeting was in the area, I called them and spoke with the manager and I explained that part of my order was missing. He said he'd deliver it within about 1/2 hour.   About an hour and a half later nothing. I called again. The manager asked me if he could just give me a credit. I said no, I prefer the food to be delivered as promised. Then he asked me what time they close. That shouldn't matter considering the food should all have been there 2 hours ago. Then he begrudgingly agreed to deliver it.   I don't know about you, but I understand it was a simple mistake, which would have normally been fine. The problem was the attitude and lack of follow through. Not to mention this was a pretty large-sized order. If this is the service they give to a customer who spends a lot, I can't imagine the service you'd get for 2.   No thank you El Burro. I'll go eat my Mexican food at some of the other great places in the city like La Palapa, Casa Reyna or Las Velas, where they appreciate you.",

Their menu is pretty straightforward, mostly in the way of burritos and tacos. When we came in they had $1 specials off the carnitas and chicken burritos. I am not sure if they have this kind of thing on rotation regularly, but it was enough motivation for us to get one of each.   The burritos were definitely a decent size for the reasonable price. They were very photogenic too, nicely wrapped with cilantro sprinkled around a lightly grilled tortilla wrap. Lots of good filling, with cheese, beans, rice, and some veggies. They offer a number of sauces/fillings that you can add for no extra charge, so those were a nice bonus. I'd say that the flavor here is just slightly less than what you'd typically find for Mexican food, but that's fine if that's what you're after sometimes. In terms of burritos though, I'm pretty happy to say that I found my go-to place in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Finally was able to try this restaurant today and my belly is happy about that. I had the chorizo soft taco and the chicken hard taco. Both were good, but the chorizo was so full of flavor and was my favorite of the two. The soft tacos come on white corn tortillas that are soft and warm and such a great complement to the chorizo. The chicken is good, a great base for cheese and salsa and whatever else you may choose. The hard taco shell was wonderfully crispy and hot. I tried both the medium and mild salsas and liked the flavor of both.   The special today, though I didn't try it, sounded interesting....goat meat tacos.   The service was very friendly, the prices are reasonable to me, and I can not wait to go back again and try some more of their menu items.",

    "text": "El Burro is a nice lunch option in the North Side.  The menu reminded me of some of my favorite Tucson-based, super authentic taco shops.  Nothing fancy, just the real deal on a menu board.  I went with the shredded beef burrito and some medium salsa on the side.    The burritos are huge! It was a brick of Mexican goodness, ready to destroy my hopes and dreams of making through an afternoon of training in Allegheny Center.  The medium salsa had just the right amount of kick to it.  The burrito itself was tasty, but something about it just didn't knock it out of the park for me.  It was definitely a more authentic flavor, but still missing something.  I'd like to go back and give the tacos a try.  Corn tortillas always amp up the authenticity and flavor, and I want to see what this guac is all about.",
