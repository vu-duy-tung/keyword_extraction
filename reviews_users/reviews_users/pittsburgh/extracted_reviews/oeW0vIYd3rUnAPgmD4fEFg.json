Waitresses had attitudes that you can see with each other just sitting at the bench area. Totally dis functional.   Once the food finally came, we had burnt but yet undercooked potatoes and burnt with undercooked bacon.   How is that possible ? Not evenly cooked at all!!!  While watching the waitresses, they would take orders touch everything then go and put bread on the toaster!! No hand washing!!!!  Needless to say we didn't eat our toast once arrived.  Once we are done it took 5 mins standings at the register for someone to check us out since they seem to not help each other.   Sorry delucas but we will not be back. For 30 dollar breakfast I expected a lot more.",

    "text": "After reading some of the negative  remarks I had to chime in.  First and foremost please realize this is a local, greasy spoon, neighborhood, breakfast like dinner with history, reputation and the Burg flare.  Is that a run-on sentence? Anyway, I doubt anyone from California will \"get it\".  Although I would expect those from the east coast or even the great lake cities to be able to identify with it.  This isn't a bad thing.  I appreciate trendy light food as much as the next Yelper, but don't go here looking for a fusion dinner with wi-fi and a coffee bar.  Yes, bring cash, be willing to wait in line, and it is a little dirty.   I am a coffee snob, so they could improve their coffee.  But, the staff is fun, the kitchen is quick and the portions are big.  The food is good hardy breakfast food.  My son particularly likes to get the waffles with ice cream.  Being an athlete who can't consumes enough calories in a day, I say go for it!  The other  kids like the pancakes while my wife and I like the omelets...   Enjoy before heading out to the strip to buy some fresh food!   Or, if its been a long night,  enjoy before heading home to bed...You decide.",

    "text": "Deluca's is the other famous breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  Like Pamela's, its independently owned, but offers amazing breakfast/brunch/lunch foods.  On weekends they have Lobser Bisque!  Every time I went to Strip District I've always seen kajillion people outside waiting in line, so I decided that I want to try it.  Like Pamela's, they offer a variety of breakfast foods, although more.  The options range from omelets to pancakes to hot cakes and crepes and waffles, and then sandwiches and soups.  I ordered Nutella Chocolate Banana Crepe, and the Sheep ordered their special for today, Cheeseburger Omelets which came with homefries.  I really loved my crepe.  It was wrapped around creamy ricotta cheese, a banana, chocolate chips, and Nutella spread.  However, the crepe itself was thicker than I expected - I would say it was more like a hotcake.  However, they also have hotcakes and pancakes, so I'm assuming hotcakes are even thicker (or greasier, since the Pamela's ones are).  The thing that I loved about the meal was that it was not greasy.  Pamela's is too greasy for me; it makes me feel like I just chugged a bottle of oil by the time I finish the meal.  Also, the ricotta cheese inside the crepe was amazing.  It was creamy, and went really well to balance out the sweetness of Nutella and chocolate chips.  Overall, this is possibly the best crepe I have ever had.  The Sheep really liked the cheeseburger omelet too.  He said that it just tasted like hamburger meat and eggs at first, but as he ate closer to the center it became really cheesey, and he loved it.  The home fries were crispy and was good.  He really loved his meal too.  The only problem with this diner is that the wait was very long.  It took us probably 20 minutes to get in, which was around 9:30am.  By the time we left, probably 10:30 ish the line was still as long.  I would say it is very much worth the wait, even under the hot sun.  =)",

My wife, her friend, and I got there early, around 8:00 on a Saturday morning, which was a bit painful on the weekend, but I am very glad we came when we did. Although we were seated immediately upon our arrival, by the time we left, an hour later, the line to get in was half way around the block!  Our waitress was extremely friendly, which was reassuring, because I think that waitstaff in popular, crowded establishments can be off-putting at times. However, ours was prompt and helpful. The coffee and water refills kept on coming.  I ordered the grilled vegetable platter with chorizo, which was absolutely humongous! The chorizo was in patty form, nicely browned, and just a bit spicy. I got some hot sauce and poured it on. The vegetables were amazingly not greasy, but steamed on the griddle. It was mostly onions and peppers, as far as I can recall. I thought, \"My God. This is ridiculous.\" However, a few minutes later, I had thoroughly disgusted myself by eating  the entire thing! I may have loosened by belt by the time I was done.  My recommendation: Go early. Go big. There is a \"healthy options\" portion in the very extensive menu, but why do this to yourself? It would be like ordering a hot dog in a seafood restaurant. This is Deluca's. It's busy, legendary, and unique. Live it up!",

I had the lobster and shrimp eggs benedict and my friend and I split a short stack of the Apples and Cream pancakes. The eggs benedict was amazing - the texture and flavors worked so well together. Also, dipping the amazing bread into the sauce and egg yolks is DEFINITELY the move. Pancakes were out of this world too. Only thing is that the place is really hectic - not very organized, which probably contributes to the long lines. Also, it's cash only (no fear, there's an ATM right next door). Finally, it's like super greasy in there. Like they need better air ventilation or something. The fact that they have an open kitchen means that I left feeling like there was oil on my hair, face, and clothing, which is kind of gross.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to come to Deluca's for a morning breakfast.  After seeing it on Man vs Food and hearing that it is one of Pittsburgh's best places for breakfast, how can I not be excited.  However, leaving the bustling breakfast place, I found myself very disappointed.  I did my research before I came here.  My mother and I only had one more day together before I went back to school, and I wanted the meal to be great.  I knew what I wanted to order before I even opened the front door to the place: the Seafood Omelette.  I made this decision based mostly off of my love for seafood and avocado.  However, when I got the dish, I was saddened  To start off with, there were only 3 little slivers of avocado spaced on top of the massive omelette.  You would think for the $13 I would get a little more, but I let it go.  I then started eating the omelette.  My first bite was shrimp; then, my next bite was shrimp; then, my next bite was once again, you guessed it, shrimp.  After I was done eating, I recalled only tasted one bite of crab.  Never did my taste buds or my eyes even see any lobster.  Very Very disappointing for the most expensive omelette on the menu.  Also, the restaurant messed up my order and gave me hash browns when I wanted the tomatoes.  The hash browns were not good at all either.  My mother and I didn't even eat either side order (which is really rare that we don't eat something).  Finally, when the waitress set down my plate she said, \"Oh, I will be right back with your toast.\"  Well, she never came back.  When she did, she was apologetic, but my mother and I had already finished our meals.    In the place's defense, the omelette was good, but it just was not what anyone should expect from one of the most expensive items on the menu; especially when there is suppose to be lobster and crab inside.  My mothers Eggs Benedict was also very good, so no complaints with her meal, except the bad hash browns.  Like I told my mom, the 3 star rating means that I would go back and eat, but I would defiantly try somewhere else in the area before I go back.",

    "text": "I waited a long time before wading into the whole Deluca's vs. Pamela's dispute, choosing to bring some friends to Deluca's because it was closest to our other errands.  I must also admit that the descriptions of Pamela's pancakes as \"crepes-like\" had some effect on my choosing to try Deluca's first.  Of course, since we come into the city from the boondocks, we arrived at the peak of Saturday morning rush, and waited about 45 minutes to get in the door, but it was a nice, crisp, sunny autumn morning and there were lots of interesting folks to look at and speak with--everyone in line was convivial, anticipating our pending feast.  Inside, the atmosphere was perfect--lots of worn formica, narrow aisles, cramped seats.  This was no showplace but a restaurant that works for a living, a diner.  The gorgeous hostess was efficient verging on brusque, and the waitstaff seemed predominantly hipster in appearnace, but once we were inside the service was swift and attentive, despite the crowds.  Not overly friendly, mind you, but I'm not here to make friends--the priority is eternally full cups of coffee and orders accurate and on time.  They rocked it.    I did traditional: pancakes, bacon, and home fries.  The pancakes taste exactly how diner pancakes are supposed to taste, the bacon was crisp but not too crisp, and the home fries were decadent and delicious.  Others in our party had the blueberry pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, the Moab, and the famous breakfast burrito.  I snuck my fork into just about all of it and found the Moab to be especially good.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat.  I departed feeling full from the generous servings, but would gladly have gorged myself further--I'll probably get the Moab next time, Deluca's has a good thing going for it and they know it.  The prices are a little higher than similar places I've visited, but are by no means excessive--part of what you're paying for is the atmosphere in the strip as well as in the diner.  It's definitely worth the hype.",

    "text": "Friends and I came here after a good workout at the gym, so we were definitely hungry. We came on a Friday at 1:30pm, so there was no wait and lots of empty tables. You would think that since they weren't busy at all, we would get our water and be able to place our orders in quickly, but that was not the case. We sat there for at least 5 minutes before being asked what we wanted to drink. After we got our water, we had to wait another 10+ minutes for her to come back and take our orders. My friend asked for a diet coke which never came so he asked again and they brought him a regular coke. I ordered the California Benedict and thought overall the taste was good, but I wasn't really a fan of the home fries that came with it. It was more than enough to eat even after the gym, so I brought what I couldn't finish home. One friend ordered the chicken & waffle which he didn't like (thought it was undercooked) and therefore didn't finish and the other ordered eggs, bacon, and home fries, which she thought was okay. I was looking forward to this place, but it didn't live up to expectations so unfortunately I won't be coming back.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 1.5 OVERALL | 3",

That didn't stop a line of people from standing outside to get in.  We, however, had reservations and walked right in much to chagrin of said folks waiting in the 5 degree weather. A table was waiting with a reserved table tent on us and we were immediately approached by our friendly server.  Two people had bailed (due to weather) and a few of our friends were running behind (due to weather) but the server had no qualms about telling us not to worry and to keep the extra two seats for our purses.   Once the entire crew arrived we ordered and received our dishes promptly.  I had the Super Bowl omelet which contained mashed potatoes, kielbasa and onions.  And that may seem a little odd to some but I tell you this was the most delicious breakfast I've ever eaten.  It came with a side of hot baked apples which I added to the omelet and it complimented it beautifully.  This also came with toast.   So, so, so very good.  There was not one complaint at the table and we all pledged to come back again soon.",

Any later and you'll be playing the extended edition of the waiting game in a queue out the door and halfway down the block. What maybe lacks in quality, is made up in quantity with manly meals such as the oh-so-famous Mixed Grill + Toast (Thanks, Adam Richman!) or Steel City Breakfast of Champs to satisfy your sweet & savory soul and then some. The Breakfast Burrito is built for two, but you might be distracted by the half melted American cheese slice and quasi tomato sauce on top. But as a potato pro, their home fries are among the best in the 412. Seek this spot out for a bountiful breakfast and nothing more. Then, head to La Prima around the corner for a proper espresso and get on w/ your morning.",

I would never spend 20+ minutes in line waiting for a spot.  Ordered a omelette, which was massive, but I prefer diced veggies, and theirs were sliced and overly sauteed.

The only thing that could make pancakes better is ice cream, really. They were light and fluffy and so sweet I couldn't finish them. Fab.  T had a Greek wrap that was AWESOME. It was served hot with chicken fresh off the flat top. It was grilled before being served so the spinach was wilted and the feta was heated through. Really awesome. I had a tad of food envy. The wrap was served with onion rings that were also pretty good.  A great local spot in the Strip!",

Had the cinnamon french toast with scrambled eggs - the french toast was hot and chewy and sweet, but the eggs... OMG, the eggs.   Best I've ever had.  Seems silly, but very few know how to make them well.  All the dishes looked great - smelled yummy and were HUGE.  Long wait in line, and cash only - but definitely will be back",

    "text": "Whoa! This place takes breakfast and goes to town with it. Awesome old school diner in Pittsburgh's Strip District. You walk inside and its like stepping back into the 1950s. Personable waitresses abound there to greet you. You can sit at the old fashioned counter or grab a booth. They have a pretty elaborate menu that offers breakfast and lunch but the breakfast is what you're here for. I ordered the Bionic Omelette not really realizing what I was getting myself into. This thing was mammoth and has practically everything in it you would eat for breakfast. Bacon, fresh sausage, onions, hash browns and more! After this meal I ate nothing else for the whole day. I was eating off of this thing for three days and believe me when I say I have a big appetite so that tells you how big it is. The coolest thing about eating here was watching the guy behind the counter cook the meal on the big fryer like someone cooking a homemade breakfast at home in their kitchen. Food comes out pretty fast and prices are okay. The bionic omelette was $13 and like I said it fed me for a few days. You can't miss this place if you're looking for it because its the place with the giant rooster on the roof. Also, theres a booth here marked where Tom Cruise sat during filming the movie Jack Reacher.",

Try the seafood eggs benedict or any of the other items as I do not think you will be unhappy.  Another nice aspect of eating here is the ability to burn some of the calories you consumed by visiting the many shops and businesses nearby- they go on for blocks  Vibe:  It is a diner!  Check out the pics on Yelp Service:  No complaints- cooked as requested Food:  Not gourmet, but very good!",

I think the perception is overrated and if folks had to do a blind taste test that this place would not come in as the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. The menu items are creatively Pittsburgh. The kielbasa omelet is one item that sticks out in my head. I ended up ordering the spinach and feta omelet. It was huge and properly cooked. My wife ordered a corn beef sandwich which also came out as expected. Everything was good and I would definitely go back again, but not so good that I would wait 30 minutes for a table.",

    "text": "My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I went down to the Strip District one very warm Saturday morning on a whim.  We didn't know where or what we wanted to eat and down there, there are more than a few options to pick from.  Dizzy from all of the choices (and perhaps low blood sugar), we walked past Deluca's.  My PIC commented on the fact that he heard that place was \"good\" and it was featured on the Food Network.  He had me at \"good\" (granted, I don't watch Food Network).  Anywho, apparently we got there at just the right time between breakfast and lunch because we got seated immediately.  We were greeted by a detached if not surly waiter.  He was efficient in taking our orders and getting our food.  Unfortunately, we never saw him again after that (except to get our bill of course).    Despite the mediocre service, the food iteself was excellent.  The True diner menu, with its seemingly hundreds of selections, had a breakfast highlight as all diners do.  My PIC and I happily obliged the menu and ordered two different breakfasts.  I got the biscuits and sausage gravy and he got a breakfast with gigantic pancakes.  The portions were huge and the food was tasty.  The people next to us had breakfast burritos that made our breakfasts look puny in comparison.  Or maybe it was me being star struck by the \"Tom Cruise's ass was here\" plaque.  We agreed that our next trip would include those (burritos, not Tom Cruise).   Unfortunately, the last time my PIC and I tried to go to Deluca's, there was a line around the block.  We didn't feel like waiting, so we went elsewhere.  I do have to say though, that I wish we had waited in line for Deluca's instead of going \"elsewhere\".  That's a regret I will take to my grave.  Just wait in line at Deluca's.  It's worth it.",

I got a Greek omelette that was mostly egg with one tomato slice, two leaves of spinach, and some bland chicken thrown in for good measure. I don't eat a lot of salt but had to add a ton. The salt shaker holes were crusted shut so I actually had to open it up and dump salt on the food. Next time I'll just make one at home.

Perfect amount of seafood, avocado, and runny yolk to cover the toasted bread underneath.   The coffee is bomb. The hot cake sundae is a perfect dessert to share for 2-3 people. And the banana praline crepe is decent (the banana is just cold wrapped in a hot crepe with a touch of sweet ricotta and yummy pralines. I would have liked it more with sliced cooked bananas)",

The wall is pleasantly filled with movie posters featuring films that used this photogenic location.",

I always get the steel city breakfast of champions-eggs, pancakes or waffles, home fries, bacon, sausage & toast for $11.95. You can't beat it. The breakfast burritos are Huge with many vegetarian options. Service is fast & friendly, honey. A real diner atmosphere. Food comes quick. Don't be intimidated if there's a line; it moves quickly.",

There's another location in Robinson but I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet. If you're here for the first time, just a heads up - the menu can be very overwhelming to look at. It had so many different options - from the pancakes and french toasts to your traditional omelets or steak & eggs. My boyfriend always order their T-bone steak and egg along with their home fries. It comes out perfect every single time. My go-to breakfast is eggs, turkey sausages & home fries. Yes it sounds so little & simple but trust me... it WILL fill you up! :) Overall I love this breakfast joint. But be ready to stand in a long line if you come here on the weekend (extra long if there's a Steelers or Pirates game)!   *CASH ONLY*",

    "text": "Went back and forth on my rating decision here. The food is certainly a five, the service a three (only somewhat fast, not particularly friendly, and expect to have to ask for refills on anything). The overall experience is in the middle as you are dealing with a ton of tasty options, a comfortable environment, a nice location for a Saturday brunch (outside of the wait and the parking challenges) and solid classic diner experience.   The price also is only decent, and though it's a single dollar sign option many of the menu items will push closer to the upper end. I had the breakfast burrito with their special sauce and yes that sauce was special, absolutely delicious. Couldn't find the breakfast menu anywhere online, so giving that as a personal recommendation.  Worth a stop if you happen to be in the Strip.",

We went early Tuesday morning and there was no wait (thankfully).  I came in from out of town and was told by several people that I had to go to Deluca's. I got the country breakfast and I was less than wowed by what I got. My meal came out to me in portions as they were ready at separate times. The fried chicken is merely a chicken tender with gravy and shredded cheese poured on top (not enough to put any on my biscuit that came out halfway through). The homefries were good.   Apparently, it is a seat yourself and grab your own menu kind of place. Another customer paying ended up handing us two menus before any staffers acknowledged our existence.  Our waitress was very nice, so I kept them at 3 stars.",

We couldn't decide between this one and another restaurant around the corner but this had more unique selections.  It was a quit turn around, seated, served, eat, and out. They were vey efficient and obviously have been opened for a while. It was all cash only though so I hope they will get with the times soon. I would've ordered more food if I could've used my card but alas I only had $10.   I ordered the apple cinnamon bun crepe. It was a good decision! So good. It had ricotta cheese melted in it and whipped cream on top. It was delicious and full of sugar so be warned. My friend got an omelet and she also loved it. The portions are big. Everything looked delicious around us too.  I enjoyed the venue, it was packed but not cramped. Old feeling but clean. It was a diner, so don't expect anything crazy. Will be back one day to try the other foods.",

    "text": "Saturday morning last weekend we were in Pittsburgh for a Pens game the night before (yay they won!)  And my husband took me to Deluca's on the strip.  We were lucky since there was no line at 830 in the morning and we got a table right away.  Decluca's first impressions are not great.  Considering it as a \"hole in the wall\" joint, the place still needs some serious TLC.  The ceilings look terrible and the walls look like they didnt know what they wanted to do - fix it or otherwise.  I like dives and hole in the walls to eat at, but I still want a complete ceiling up top, not one that looks like its under construction or caving in on me.   The service is decent.  A small place with lots of tables close to one another, you'll be able to get someone's attention for sure.  However, its the food and the reason why people are there right?  My husband had a Mexican omelet - or the like and I had a corned beef hash plate.  Even with my healthy appetite, I couldn't eat but a third of the food.  He didn't care much for his entree so he actually helped me eat mine.  Even so, there was leftover food.     There were lots of pancakes and similar items on the menu that looked tempting.  But with portion sizes so big, there was no way for me to even suggest trying to get something in addition to our plates.   I would suggest going there with big appetites and possibly consider sharing!  It's ok and I would consider going back if I don't have to wait in line.  But nothing so amazing that I'd stand outside on a cold winter day to get inside.",

I had eggs over medium, bacon, etc. which was good for the price but my eggs were more on the over easy side.  Others had the special - French toast with strawberries and got fudge.  I was told it was wonderful.  A definite Pittsburgh dive - and a must try.  Just beware of the stairs to the restroom.",

    "text": "We stayed in downtown Pittsburgh to get the full city experience. This place was supposed to have the best breakfast, but I didn't find anything special about it. I got the Italian Vegetarian Fritatta. Some of the veggies were cooked okay, but the onions were not. They ruined the dish by the bitter flavor (which I have found are usually reflective of 'old' onions). Others had the full stack of pancakes, blueberry french toast, raspberry crepes, and kid's chocolate chip pancakes.nothing really amazing there either. Nobody finished their food. That is either because they gave us a lot (in most cases) or the person did not like it enough to over stuff themselves to finish it. We ended up leaving with lots of leftovers, and my son who wasn't with us when we went enjoyed eating them. But he also is a very hungry teenager with a large appetite :).  Also only takes cash. No checks or credit.",

Had to give her a Pittsburgh experience of the strip district. My sister got eggs Benedict, she loved it on the Mancini's toast. My friend got the man vs food special (can't recall the name) but everything was mixed together in a heavenly mix. Stepmom got a classic breakfast, raved about the bacon. I had the moad, pronounced moe ad. It was a breakfast burrito with Spanish style sauce and chorizo. We then shared a banana split crepe. Yes, we went all out! Everything was amazing!",

I have visited on weekdays and weekends. The former is always better. Lines are short to non-existent on those day's. Weekends always has lines out the door that provides wait times of up to 30 minutes. On this Tuesday morning I walked right in and was seated straight away. Drinks were quickly served; no coffee for me but some of the orange juice. It was good but I prefer fresh squeezed. So I decided on a short stack of buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs and some bacon. Everything was tasty, as always and served quickly. The service was great and everyone was super friendly. I have visited a handful of times in each of my prior visits and will make it a point to continue that tradition as long as they are around when I am in the 'burgh. Prices are always fair and comparable to fast-food and chain style restaurants. Parking is on the street and can be limited, especially on the weekends.",

I had a MOAB (mother of all burritos) and my friend got the bionic omelet (should be called \"freak of nature\"). We waited about 30 minutes outside before getting in and now understand why. It takes extra time to make your way out of the restaurant due to all the food you eat here, thus slowing down the line. We had a great time and will be headed back soon. I will try Pamela's (a rival breakfast shop) sometime and then compare them. This place is highly recommended.  Cash only.",

Much shorter though, so we got breakfast here and it was just what we needed.  I got the corned beef hash, well done/crispy, and was super satisfied. It still looks like the canned hash rather than homemade, but cooked perfectly and there was plenty of food. I didn't even need my toast, which he actually brought much later.  My one negative point was he never checked on our water or coffee. I put my empty coffee cup at the edge of my table, and he walked by briskly a few times with coffee but only served the table he was getting orders from. He was so busy if I missed him while he ran by, I wouldn't see him for a while unless I only paid attention to him. I'd rather eat than stare at a waiter. In the end I didn't get more coffee because it was such a hassle. I guess you can't have everything! And they can't have five stars.",

What I got for my 8.79 was milk gravy that tasted like they scraped the griddle after making sausage patties and added them to the gravy and it was starting to congeal. The eggs were gone in 3 bites and the hash browns were mushy white paste on the plate.  My sister ordered eggs meat hash browns with a side of sourdough toast. Toast was 2.79 for 2 pieces of  toast so coldthat it wouldn't even melt her butter. The hash browns again, were white paste.  The only good part of this meal was the coffee.

We were in a party of 8, and were willing to split into two parties of 4. However, the hostess was able to get us all sitting together! Score!  The place is a pretty authentic diner. Cash only, several tables, booth and counter seating, and an open kitchen so you can smell the bacon and eggs that gets everyone in good spirits. It also has very tight and narrow spaces, so be careful going to your seat! The menu has many, many options, so I just stayed on the first page. I ordered the breakfast burrito with corned beef hash and home fries. And coffee. Coffee is always necessary. Others ordered crepes, benedicts, and the turkey club. The breakfast burrito was as large as my plate, and satisfied my hunger.   Thankfully, the wait for our food was not as long as the wait outside. Service is efficient, and our coffee and water glasses were never empty.  I'd come here again if I was back in town! It's located in the Strip district with a parking lot close by!",

There's almost always a line out the door. We did have to wait a while, but it didn't seem long at all. I ordered an ordinary breakfast with over medium eggs, bacon, and toast. It was good and satisfied my appetite. My mom ordered the mixed grill. It's not the most pretty thing, but it sure is yummy. My aunt, however, ordered their cinnamon French toast, and I had to try a few bites. It was delicious. That's for sure what I'm going to order the next time I'm there.  The only thing that sort of bothered me is how packed the restaurant gets, and I was feeling a bit claustrophobic. That's not such a big deal when their food is good though, and I forgot all about it when I was eating. I also hardly saw anyone on staff smile other than the cooks who seem to be the only people who were happy.  All in all, its a great breakfast and lunch spot. While the experience didn't wow me, there's plenty of items on the menu for everyone to find something they'll enjoy.",

The eggs were good, and the pancakes and kielbasa were great. I was expecting house pancakes smeared with peanut butter but received pancakes infused with peanut butter flavor; they were soft and fluffy yet concrete in flavor; thus, the pancakes sufficed all of the principles I seeks in pancakes. The kielbasa was crispy; it was well done but not overcooked.  Previously, I've had an omelette and home fries, and I can verify that these dishes are  tasty and generously portioned.  The service was great too. As I mentioned, our larger group was quickly accommodated, our orders were taken promptly, and the food was delivered warm.

It seemed like the rest of the city had the same idea, but I was committed to visiting here and leaving satisfied. Done.  Yes, you'll wait for a table (and probably even wait outside), but the cooks, servers and bus boys moved very efficiently, knocking out orders for all the small booths and tables. Once we were seated, one menu item called out to me: Texas Cinnamon French Toast with eggs and bacon. Oh, and coffee, of course.  In no time at all, it was all sitting in front of me and in no time at all, it was all gone. The scrambled eggs were pretty standard, the bacon was perfectly cooked (not fatty and not burnt to a crisp) and the French toast was sweet and delicious, even without adding any syrup.  As already mentioned, the service was prompt and the prices were reasonable. However, this is a \"Cash Only\" spot, so keep the plastic in your wallet.",

I won't be able to review about their lunch and dinner as my fiance stopped by to eat breakfast. I got the grilled mixed, amazing especially if you love veggies! I had fresh veggies with over easy egg with a slice of ham. I loved the atmosphere of the place. I was pretty jealous my fiance got the country fried chicken.  I wanted to eat all of his food. The fried chicken was fried and seasoned to perfection!! The gravy tasted just like biscuits and gravy. This is an absolute place you have to check out in Pittsburgh.",

I was worried the table of 7 would take a long time, but a table had opened up in 10 minutes. It was fantastic! Great place to take friends with all sorts of food preferences. I ordered the 2 eggs with homefries and bacon. BACON was so good. Thick enough and crispy. Wasn't a huge fan of the homefries, I would like them crunchier. The fried chicken was really good though. Super tender and savory. We also shared the pumpkin filled crepes and sundae waffle with strawberries. OH MY... it was soooo loaded. I really like both desserts and we even finished the pumpkin crepe. Not overly sweet!",

    "text": "I stopped by here today with my parents and sister for breakfast.  We were debating over a place to eat in the Strip District and I offered up DeLuca's as I have had decent experiences there before and there is always a line out the door waiting for seats.  We arrived at around 9:15 and walked right into the restaurant and were seated in the upstairs portion.  The inside of this place is nothing special and looks like many other diners.  They did have a t shirt from man v food (circa 2006) on the wall above us.  For my breakfast I decided to start off with a coffee which was poured within seconds of ordering and delivered to our table.  Then after a few minutes of deliberating over the huge menu I ended up going with the Huevos Rancheros for my breakfast.  After ordering our waitress disappeared and I am pretty sure that I never saw her again until we had to ask another waitress to get her for our check.  That meant that after about 10 minutes of waiting with an empty cup of coffee, I ended up helping myself to the pot that was sitting nearby.  I never did get a third cup which would have been nice.  Anyways, after a reasonable amount of time our food made it out to our table and my Huevos Rancheros looked pretty good.  The egg was sunny side up and whenever I cut through it, the yolk dripped nicely onto the tortilla, cheese, salsa and chorizo underneath it.  It tasted decently enough although I would have personally liked it quite a bit spicier.  After I was about half way through my my meal the avocado that was supposed to come on it materialized to our table.  It was maybe 1/4 of a total avocado cut into 4 very small slices which were quickly gone.  Whenever my family and I had finished our meals we proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table.  Finally giving up on that we asked another waitress to ask our waitress for the bill.  She did and about 10 minutes later and after again asking our waitress for the bill, we were able to pay.  The sad thing is that we were trying to get out of there and there was a huge line of people outside waiting to get in.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably avoid coming here in the future.  While the food was decent tasting I found it to be overpriced and our service was just miserable.",

Having said that--We just went again and the service was terrible. It was a slow day, and there were a ton of staff on, and we still waited 10-15 minutes to have our order taken. My food didn't come as described in the menu, and the mashed potatoes came in a gigantic flavorless mound. If you want a ton of mediocre food, in a fun, old-school diner atmosphere, this is your spot. If you want something truly delicious, look elsewhere.",

I went just this past Friday....and I absolutely love it there!! We didn't have to wait at all at the time we went around 11..I was so surprised it wasn't busier, but I think it just all depends on the times and day it is. First off, I do want to mention the staff is not very friendly at all there! They almost seemed bothered that there are people eating at this place. That's the only negative thing I have to say. The atmosphere is cute, typical diner, I love how it looks like an old fashioned diner. We sat at the booth where Tom Cruise sat at during a scene filmed at Deluca's for Jack Reacher. I think that adds a cool touch to the place! Their menu has to be the biggest menu I have ever seen! There are so many options, it's a little overwhelming to be honest. They don't just have breakfast items, they have lunch and dessert items. There food is absolutely delicious!! I can not wait to go back!",

Well, for one, the breakfast burrito that barely fits on the plate.  For another, the Steel City Breakfast of Champions that includes all the breakfast food staples.  Need more?  The Bionic Omelet made of 6 eggs and as many fillings.  I've taken on all of these challenges (not at once) and triumphed 2 of the 3 times.  (The Bionic Omelet's onions got the better of me and I just couldn't finish.)  And I just have to love any place that serves Mancini's Italian toast.  This place can get busy, but it runs like a machine.  Sit at the counter by the grill on a Saturday or Sunday morning and just watch in amazement at how quickly and efficiently orders are filled when there's a line out the door.  Sometimes the wait service can be a little slow.  And it is still a cash only establishment.  But it is still my go-to breakfast spot in the Strip.  The prices I sometimes feel can be a little steep, but then I see the portion size and it makes sense.  Deluca's is always, in a word, dependable.",

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it literally came out in less than 30 seconds.  I was sitting next to the grill so I saw that they really made it and didn't just reheat something and their speed is impressive!  The food was pretty tasty but it had a bit too much chorizo (and I love meat).  Huge portion sizes and definitely a very Pittsburgh sort of place.  Don't go here if you are looking for something healthy ;)  I went back again later with a couple of friends and we all had a great experience.  The portions are HUGE and everything was delicious.  I think my friend's omelet had like 6 eggs and at least a pound of meat.",

Eggs, spicy sausage, and cheese on Mancini's bread. Just do it.  - Service is very quick and efficient. Try to run out of coffee. You can't! - The menu is huge, lots of good stuff to try.   CONS: - Its CASH ONLY, and it's now year 2018...  And that's all I can offer on the negative side.   If you've had this on your list but still haven't tried it, DO IT NOW!

The experience is always a bit hectic but the food makes it worth it. The portions at Deluca's are huge and so far everything I've tasted has been delicious.  My boyfriend makes sure to always order the cinnamon roll pancake which is a pancake with cinnamon and frosting glaze on it and it's amazingggg!

I'm not a big sweets person, but I have taken large bites of my sister's chocolate chip pancakes. They're absolutely delicious, and enough to feed the whole family. However, I am a savory omelette type of morning gal. I've had both the Super Bowl and the Seafood omelettes, and they're amazing. I especially love the seafood omelette because for $13.99, you receive an omelette the size of a newborn child and it is STUFFED with seafood. It is such a good deal! Besides the omelettes, my favorite item is the seafood Benedict. Their hollandaise sauce is incredible and of course, you have a solid 3-4 meals out of it.  Ugh, I'm sad I won't get my Deluca's fix until next month. If you're in Pittsburgh and have some cash (no cards!), definitely stop by. It's worth the hype.",

We arrived early Thursday morning and did not wait, we were seated immediately. It is cash only but atms are all around and we didn't mind stopping and getting cash out. We are from California, but if we return to Pittsburgh we would definitely return to DeLucas",

    "text": "Ok, so up until this point, I would say Deluca's gets 4 stars. However, yesterday I had an experience to give them that extra star. I always get one of the eggs Benedict or something in the sandwich section or a regular breakfast with pancakes.   But wait so back to yesterday, we had multiple servers come up and wait on us and try to fill our water or get us stuff. On top of that, my friend doesn't eat pork so he asked for all turkey sausage with his meal. Unfortunately it came out with bacon piled on it. However, the waitress immediately took it back once we said it wouldn't have been a big deal but he doesn't eat pork and they started making a whole new plate of everything.   I decided to branch out and get the chicken and waffle. I'm picky about chicken and waffles no matter where I go because I've had some great ones and some ok ones. But let me tell you, this no frills chicken and waffle was amazing. It's nothing fancy, which is what I expected. But the chicken was soooo juicy and breaded and fried perfectly and the waffle had just enough sweetness to it to balance it out and was dense but fluffy at the same time. And the best part is it comes with a side of eggs. Usually when I get chicken and waffles I want eggs and get them as a side but this one it comes with it and I got them over easy and it was great.   Honestly I can't wait to go get it again.",

I had the California Dreamin salad: greens, chicken, feta, pecans, strawberries and blueberries. When it came out, the strawberries and blueberries were not fresh - they were thawed out frozen fruit, that were very soggy and wet in my salad. If you can't have fresh fruit in your restaurant... WHY PUT IT ON THE MENU? After removing the fruit from my salad, I did enjoy it - it was tasty without it. Two more things that made me uneasy: watching a member of staff prep vegetables... she was sitting at the counter slicing tomatoes with her bare hands. These were obviously not going to be cooked (which would sanitize them), because they were sliced to fit on sandwiches.  Next, another woman emerged from downstairs and immediately started a screaming match with coworkers across the room. She was right next to our table. Awkward.  Needless to say, this place has gone downhill. I feel like it needs a health inspection.",

    "text": "I genuinely do not understand the hype about this place. I'm all for waiting in line for 30-45 minutes if the place is \"worth the wait\", but sadly this is not the case.   My family of 5 was split into two tables, we were told they were not allowed to seat 5 people in a booth, even though we voiced our preference was to be together. That's fine, everyone has rules. Their entire back section was reserved for a party of 20, which was expected to show up about 10 minutes after our arrival. This party of 20 never showed up and the diner staff never offered that we be moved to those tables where we would've been able to sit altogether. Minor detail, but it would've been greatly appreciated.   When I ordered my breakfast, I paused waiting for the waitress to ask me how I like my eggs, bacon or sausage, etc. When I paused, she snapped back and said, \"You have to tell me how you want your eggs.\" It was so short & so rude.   The food was subpar, it was at least cheap but so was the quality.   These instances are small in nature, but they were not countered with any redeeming qualities. All in all, this place was not worth it: the line was long, the service was horrific, and the food was terrible. After years working in hospitality, I tend to be pretty lenient and understanding of the different struggles that go into a restaurant. This place does not deserve leniency or your time.",

Employees are focused, happy and active participants regarding service and quality of experience.   The crepes are fabulous, we the apple and the lingonberry. Both generous, sweet and flavorful.

The meat and eggs were cooked to perfection and the cost is reasonable for the amount of great food you get. Other family members ordered pancakes that covered the platters, not plates.

    "text": "This review was brought to you by the letter P.  P is for patience and I hope you have some if you're choosing DeLuca's.  My friends alerted me to the fact that they've never been to the Pittsburgh staple, DeLuca's.  So after a rough previous day/night we decided we'd venture down to the Strip and get our fill on diner breakfast at noon on a Sunday.  The line out of the door didn't sway our choice.  We were in it for the long haul and what else can you expect, it was a beautiful Sunday and people were hungry.  The four of us waited probably 20 minutes to get in and by this time we were very hungry and in desperate need of caffeine.    The first \"problem\" with DeLuca's is that their menu is too expansive.  Some would view this as a problem, myself included in that I have too much of a hard time deciding what I want to shove down my gullet.  The waitress, a nice enough lady, swung by after a few minutes to get our drink orders.  A round of water and coffee please.  The drinks arrived soon there after and we finally figured out what we'd have to eat.  The place was packed so expected to wait a bit for our food and we did probably another 20-30 minutes, which was fine.  However, after finishing our coffees we weren't pleased with having to wait and wait for fill ups.  As a former waiter this is a red x with me and coupled with the black grease encased around some of my homefries knocked this heavy weight in the Pittsburgh food scene down a peg.    I enjoyed my meal though and it was definitely a huge portion as were all my buddy's.  The fried chicken and biscuits with gravy, homefries, and eggs was exactly what I needed after a long day of brew festing and staying up way later than I am used to.  The chicken was fried very well, moist on the inside, crispy exterior even with the gravy.  Eggs were over easy as I ordered.  The biscuits were warm and tasted homemade.  And aside from a few homefries swimming in black grease from the griddle were exactly what you want in a homefry.  Some crisp with that griddle fried skin and some mushy.    DeLuca's doesn't need any help from Yelp and won't go out of business because of this review or any other review, it's a giant because of their portions, location, and history so go if you're patient and have a hunger for something greasy.",

AMAZING food, INCREDIBLE service, and that small time diner feel with food that surpassed expectations. Before I talk about food, I have to mention the management. My dad grew up here, and when we came to eat here in November (we were visiting from Texas) they were already closed. Well the owner was outside and she heard we had friends that liked this place, she let us in and fed us a HUGE meal for a perfect price. We were the only ones in the diner but she made us feel so welcome. She was so nice and easy to talk to. It was really cool. The portions here are huge so come in hungry! Their French Toast and I believe other bread items on the menu are from Mancini's bread shop next door, which is the best Italian bread ever, so the French Toast was literally THE BEST French Toast I've ever had. That's saying a lot because I love french toast and try it at every breakfast place I go to. I still have dreams about it.  I can't wait to visit The Strip again and come to Deluca's for a huge meal at a great price surrounded by friendly, caring people. Great experience all around.",

A place where one meal can get you through the day, with the help of some antacids of course.  Servings are large, hearty, and filling.

It is not the easiest place to get to via the bus and parking is near impossible on a Saturday or Sunday. So if it is at all a possibility, go to Deluca's during the week and you will eliminate this hassle from your experience.   That out of the way this place is definitive of Pittsburgh through and through. It is a great greasy diner and the service is great! I have only ever had the breakfast burrito and the pancakes -- both of which are delicious. The only knock my friends have on the food is that it is so \"predictable.\" To that I say: IT IS A DINER PEOPLE!   I don't know if people are expecting gourmet cuisine, but if that is what you are looking for do not go to Deluca's. Go to Deluca's if you want an awesome diner breakfast and do not want to be hungry for the remainder of the day.",

The portion sizes are pretty decent, I had a 6 egg omelet with a lot of meat in it. It tasted good enough, and filled me up. Like most diner food, I felt pretty queasy later on in the day from all of the grease.   There were 2 huge negatives to this place. First was the price. It wasn't out of this world expensive, but just not worth what they charge. It came to about 25 dollars for 2 people. We only drank water and there were no add on sides.   The second was, some nasty waiter walking around putting his fingers on everything. I saw this guy working at some desk, rummaging through drawers then back to serving the food. He was touching a lot of peoples foods with his bare hands, not washing or sanitizing. It seemed very needless to touch them the way he was.

Probably no longer related to the original DeLuca.  At any rate, they were prepared for a long wait; had just hunkered down to weather the blowhard frat type behind them bellowing into his iPhone about the difference between a wine and beer hangover and repeatedly declaring his determination to see what waiting in line for breakfast was all about; when the angel of breakfast mercy, a rotund little bespectacled woman, called out for two people willing to sit at the counter.  Counter, you say?  This particular couple *loves* counter-sitting at greasy spoons, watching short order cooks literally sling hash, fry eggs and flip flapjacks with deft precision and enviable speed.  And so the counter is exactly where they landed this Saturday morning, entranced by the choreography behind it, ignoring the sticky Linoleum floors.  He had Chicken and Waffles -- buckwheat waffle, to be exact -- she the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes.  And, oh.  They were both so happy.  Crisped, crunchy white meat chicken atop a flavorful and toothsome waffle, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with syrup; cinnamon-studded hotcakes with swirls of icing and swaths of maple syrup.  Washed down by the requisite *okay* drip coffee.  Served by a manager with his finger on the pulse of every server, line cook and bus boy in the joint.  Cash only, dear reader.

I saw people standing in line waiting to eat while jackhammers were chipping up the sidewalk a few feet away. That kind of devotion says it all!  The food was good, the service was great. The food isn't greasy or nasty. The menu choices are unique. I would eat there again. I would recommend eating there on weekdays to avoid the crowds.   Pittsburgh's Strip District has some great places to shop and wonderful foods to purchase. I can't wait to go back.",

My family of 6 fell in love and we went here 2 times on our vacation in just 4 days. The coffee and their breakfast sausage was just amazing. We liked them so much we went next door a few stores down and bought the coffee, and a few blocks down we bought 5 pounds of sausage to bring home.  Service was excellent, staff was very pleasant.",

    "text": "Now for the conclusion of my Deluca's adventure...                        Insomnia, Daylight Savings Time, The Devil, and I  \"Springing Forward,\" a lack of Kay around (she was visiting relatives out of town for the weekend), and a looming Monday morn cursed me with a fitful night of near-sleeplessness. There was however a brief, tortured dreamtime interlude in which I had a second encounter with The Adversary, he who caused me to gorge and involuntarily purge at Burgatory over 2 years ago...                Delusions of Grandeur, The Great Beast, and Growling, Animate Grub   From a ring of black smoke, The Adversary  introduced me to The MOAB, the MUTHA of all Burritos, and there is nothing maternal about it. The Fallen Angel and his emissary of stuffed tortilla belitted me, spat at me, and became intangible when I attempted to thrash them. \"You'll never finish it,\" The Adversary derisively shouted, his voice sounding like broken glass as the lumpen ogre that is the MOAB uttered gutteral, gutter epithets.                                           Destroy My Digestive System At Dawn  My skin clammy, and my stomach somewhat queasy, I foolishly leapt from my bed, washed up, dressed and headed to The Strip to defeat a burrito. I arrived ten minutes early and waited patiently to enter. Once I did, however, MOAB and The Adversary decided to play mindgames with me, telling me that I could get my hands on either of them IF I bested both an omelet and a dessert pancake. It would be a handicap match with a stipulation too gratifying to resist.   \"In this corner, weighing in at a combined weight of err...several pounds, and seconded by The Adversary and MUTHA of All Burritos, the team of Captain Drew's Seafood Omelet and The Funky Monkey Pancakes.\"  The crowd jeered, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the hero...  *Entrance music*  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUu4emT6btH4&s=5cf65ddbf8c7665c7485a379706b951df7432331f7f9f43ce23f3be6728511ff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Uu4e...</a>  \"Coming to the ring and weighing in at 210 pounds, he is Proletarian Steel, ladies and gentleman, Darren W!\"   The crowd stands and collectively roar like a turbine. 10,000 feet meet the arena floor, making the sound of a marching army. The pancake dish is a tower of terror constructed from 3 chocolate-chip banana pancakes, whipped cream, hot fudge, and golden vanilla ice cream, and it attacked first, punishing me with carbohydrates, sludgy cocoa, cream, and frozen dairy products. As I was halfway finished with it, in came Captain Drew's Seafood Omelet to blindside me. Topped with avocado chunks, a buttery Hollandaise (one of the better Hollaindaise sauces I've had at area restaurants) and suffused with garlic sauteed Langostinos, lump crabmeat, phat-ass shrimp, and an Asiago/Swiss cheese blend, the newspaper-roll omelete threatened to engulf me in eggy, yellow oblivion, yet I munched and chomped my way to victory, hitting Captain Drew with a quick spear to get the pinfall while Funky Monkey was dumped outside of the ring via a fireman's carry.   Those pancakes however...  Perhaps it was that I was running out of time or that the ice cream was heavy and rich enough on its own, but I was only able to eat 2/3 of it. Call it a non-contest after The Adversary and MOAB interfered and TV time expired, but not being able to fight them all off, I was quadruple-teamed, taking The Adversary's cane in the stomach along with several splashes. The Adversary and MOAB would then \"cut a promo\" promising to clog and crush my \"working-class chump heart\" as I was carried away by officials.   \"You did good,\" said my spry, affable, and conscientous waitress (she reheated my sourdough toast when it had gotten cold). \"Most people would never be able to eat all that food.\"   \"Eh, I wish I hadn't,\" I told her. \"It was real good, though.\"  But I'll be back. I've a vendetta on my shoulders.",

That is a compliment for me... sometimes we just want a breakfast that does not cry out to be healthy and DeLuca's offered me just that on my day off this past Monday.    Any time I have been in the Strip, I have wanted to go but the lines were too crazy and out of control.  So being down in the Strip when it was not nearly as busy finally allowed me the opportunity to finally have the Mixed Grill that I had been yearning for.   This amazing home fries covered in grilled mixed veggies and then eggs with toast was scrumptious!  My coffee was always full, and my stomach left full so I was very much a happy camper.    If you hate lines and waiting, come here during the week... it is a definite must have!",

So please understand that my rating is serious! as a serious breakfast connoisseur. Deluca's gets hype because it's awesome. It's not fancy. but it is some serious down to earth good breakfast foods. no pomp, no circumstance. just food. and a good amount of it also. I can often be found here eating eggs benedict, with reckless abandon, a big grin on my face, and a side of bacon well done.   Favorite foods: Greek Eggs benedict! steak tomato and feta? INSANE. Seafood benedict! equally insane Any of their pancakes (I don't even like pancakes, but I like theirs)  There is some times a wait, but they really do their best to keep it moving, and the staff are all super nice and speedy at getting you your future food coma. I'm not a fan of their coffee (read my reviews about my coffee snobbery elsewhere) but it will get the job done, eyes bright and alert! - their proximity to 21st street coffee as well as all of the other wonderful places in the strip makes a visit here a great start to all days that end in Y.   They are cash only but there is a PNC ATM 2-3 doors down. I'm a repeat customer, a fan, and I'm sure you will be too.",

It didn't take long for us to get a table, maybe 15 minutes.  Our waitress came over shortly afterwards and took our order.  It then took about 15-20 minutes for her to bring our drinks.  The food was just mediocre.  I had a waffle that was undercooked.  Someone else had the oatmeal that was not very hot. The last person got eggs, bacon and hotcakes which was maybe the best choice.  The food came out pretty quick, considering how long it took for drinks.  It was just so-so, possibly even less than so-so.  I'd recommend Pamelas's over Delucas.",

They put it on some sort of French bread instead of a biscuit, and it didn't get soggy fast, which made all the difference. The avocado on it was fresh on the eggs - and the sauce on top was perfect. Our waitress was also super helpful and nice. She did a fantastic job. The only downside is that they are cash only. Oh well - small price to pay for being so delicious!

I always get a sweet stuff such as pancakes or waffles, and a savory entree. I usually got either omelette or egg Benedict. They have a huge selection on breakfast food, they also serve lunch food but I've never tried them before. The only reason I didn't give them a five stars is that they don't take credit cards, and also sometimes the servers are too busy to check on you as often as I wanted to. Other than that, de Lucas never fail to satisfy :) it is a great place to take your friends or out of town visitors. Oh, and it's worth the long wait ;)",

This is why I wake up in the morning, this is what we all have in common, and this is why I would wait on a line for 45 minutes, for good food. The local people outside waiting like us said this place is amazing. The couple being older told us about all the local spots, but insisted we picked the right one. They also mentioned Deluca's was featured in \"Jack Reacher\" and on \"Man vs. Food\". There are other famous people that dined here, but I don't have the time to name them all. When we finally got inside we had to wait to be seated. There were empty tables but the staff moved slow. I was surprised by that, but not everyone moves like a New Yorker. My brother asked if they could hurry up and seat us but the waitress was rude and kept walking. I didn't worry about it as we were seated next. When I walked to my seat I noticed a plaque which stated \"Tom Cruise\" sat here. Oh boy, now I felt like I was lucky. The rude waitress ended up being our  server, how's that for Irony. She was still rude but it was ok, I am here to eat! They had so much food already cooked the wait wasn't that bad. When my meal finally came I had to wait because the waitress forgot my bacon. But when it arrived I dug right in. I am running out of words to use to describe incredible food. This breakfast was by far the best meal I have ever eaten. Words can't be put together the right way to explain the full measure on how amazing this meal was. I have no negative other then the packaged butter being to hard. I am so annoyed with finding these gems and not having them in New York. If I come to Pittsburgh again this will be my number one breakfast stop. I just need to bring a bigger pair of jeans.",

    "text": "I'm so in between 4 & 5 stars. Maybe I'll decide by the end of this review.   We stopped in after I've been patiently waiting to have breakfast here. There was a party in front of us, but we were fine sitting at the counter.   We took a little while to look over the menu. It had so many options. Multiple choices for omelets, french toast, pancakes (AND crepes), breakfast sandwiches ect.  I even noticed a dessert-type of pancakes which had chocolate sauce for example and whip cream-- again multiple choices in that section as well. We took a little while to decide. Note: This is just the breakfast menu that I'm referring too ^^  I ordered the steel city breakfast of champions. It came with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, sausage patty, home fries, toast plus my choice of pancakes, waffle or french toast. I chose the french toast. My breakfast definitely satisfied me and filled me up! The french toast was extremely fluffy and had powdered sugar on it :D Loved the home fries by the way! It was fun to witness the cooks make them from the counter (if you're counting calories, don't watch them make the home fries, fyi!)  Bobby started ordering an omelet with whatever he wanted in it.. The kind server suggested the Bionic Omelet which has 5 eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, pepperoni, onions, cheddar & provolone. This omelet was huge (take a look at the picture I added) I'm not exaggerating. I should have shown my little hand compared to it. I wouldn't have guessed 5 eggs, it looked like maybe 8. He was only able to finish half the omelet. His words \"I need to finish this to feel like a man\" haha.   We had a great time & I'm excited to head back. Next time we may try the Robinson location since he works up that way. I believe they have longer hours as well.   okay, 5 stars :) I don't even care that I have to stop at the ATM before heading here (cash only)",

But the wait wasn't too too bad, even if it was out in the cold for about 15 minutes. Totally worth it once you're warm inside and a hot plate of breakfast food is staring at you!  I'm going to do the thing you shouldn't do but everyone does, compare it to Pamela's. I mean, it's one of the most popular breakfast spots in Pittsburgh, how can I not!? And happily I'd say it was totally on par. Would I say it's better? Probably the same, but for different reasons.   They looked to have a bigger menu than Pamela's, serving hotcakes (what Pamela's is famous for) and regular pancakes. Although I'm a huge pancake fan and most of the options looked amazing, I really wanted a regular down home eggs, homefires, sausage and toast breakfast.  And with an expanded menu they have so many choices beyond the menu! When I asked for sausage she was like, patty, turkey, hot, veggie... the list went on! I had to hear them twice! My homefries were good, I added onion and pepper to the mix, I just wish they would have been a tad crispier.   The place really does have it's own identity, with the red vinyl booths and memorabilia on the walls. Service was friendly, but remember they are CASH ONLY!",

I had been wanting to try here for ages, and as someone who is unimpressed with Pamela's, I wasn't sure if Deluca's would be a big disappointment too.  I am happy to report that I really enjoyed this place, and it is significantly better than Pamela's.  Let me start with the decor.  It is so tacky and wonderful.  It is totally bizarre and gives this place a unique vibe, considering it is just a diner.  It fascinated the group throughout breakfast.  I ordered the Western Omelette ($10.29).  It came with toast and hash browns, but I don't eat potatoes so I just opted for toast.  The omelette was good and loaded up nicely.  They also threw in both red and green peppers which was a nice treat.  There are lots of toast options to choose from, and I enjoyed the sour dough.  The biscuits and gravy one of my friends ordered were yummy as well.  The price was a touch high, but the food was good.  After seeing the pancakes go by, though, I would have to try them next time.  Overall, it's not worth waiting in line for more than a few minutes, but this place is good.",

Friend of Joe's, Kevin was in town for some R&R and called me on a cold Thursday morning for breakfast, I offered Deluca's as a choice since I've never been there and neither has he. After he accepted, I got to thinking how bad parking was in the strip. Low and behold a spot opened about a half block away. We walked in and immediately were seated in the same booth Adam Richman sat in filming a spot for Man Vs Food some years back. Once seated, a waitress zoomed in with menus, coffee cups and a hot pot of coffee, almost reading my mind. The coffee was okay, nothing special, think the same coffee at Eat N Park or Kings, a little disappointing. Looking over the menu it was loaded with Pittsburgh favorites and gluttonous offerings. I choose the thin, crepe like pancakes served with loganberry preserves. Kevin on the other hand chose the Steel City breakfast, 2 hot cakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, and toast made from Macinie's bread. It was huge amount of food. My crepe like pancakes were lite, airy and delicious. The loganberry preserves with the perfect compliment for them, adding a touch of sweetness, a perfect foil for the savory crepes. The bill came to under 16 bucks which isn't too bad, about the same as Eat N Park or King's. the only trouble is parking, and would derail me from making this one of my go to places.",

    "text": "Whenever I visit a city that I haven't been to before, I insist on eating at a place that is True to the character of that city.  After my visit to Deluca's, I have no hesitation in claiming that this restaurant is Pittsburgh at its finest.  This efficient and popular greasy-spoon joint serves up hearty meals at a decent price.    They claim to offer the \"best breakfast in town,\" and I wouldn't argue with that statement...nor would the millions of other people who waited 30+ minutes to even get into the restaurant on the cold, wet, and snowy Saturday morning I went.  I ordered the seasonal pumpkin pancake special, and I was pleasantly surprised that they gave me the option of ordering kielbasa as the side meat instead of just the usual ham or breakfast sausage.  I almost feel bad giving this place just 4 stars because I really liked it.  But alas, it just wasn't my favorite type of food, and as much as the long wait and cash-only policy is characteristic of this diner-style restaurant, it wasn't exactly pleasant.  Beware that if you come during a busy time with a large group (5+ people), expect to wait a bit longer than smaller groups.",

My cousins are vegetarian and were able to find things on the menu that they liked. Rather than going for a sandwich, or breakfast, went for one of the their wraps. It was big, sloppy to eat, and very tasty. I had their Southwest Chicken melt..gooey cheese, chicken, avocado, and more. It hit the spot and provided plenty of energy for a whirlwind tour of Pittsburgh. Look forward to returning to share the place with my husband.",

    "text": "If you are a fan of breakfast food, you will be a fan of Deluca's Restaurant. That is really all that needs to be said about this iconic Pittsburgh breakfast spot. If you are reading this however, I am sure you would probably like a little bit more information on what is actually happening here.  Located in the Strip District, and featured on Man v. Food, Deluca's Restaurant is the top choice for those looking for some grub to start their day off. During our visit, we arrived later in the morning and were greeted with a line that went out of the building and extended onto the cold sidewalk outside. However, the line moved very fast, and the employees did everything they could to get people in and out in the most productive way possible.  After being seated, and looking over the menu, I decided to get the Steel City breakfast, which is basically a little bit of everything on the menu. In fact, I felt a little glutenous when they brought out my three plates of food, but hey, I needed to get my foodie on. From the eggs, to the french toast, everything I ate was absolutely delicious. Greasy, and delicious. It was one of those meals that is just so delicious, that you don't even take the time to make conversation with your fellow diners because you are too busy stuffing your face.  I wish that Deluca's was here in Cincinnati. I would go to this wonderful restaurant every morning if I could. If you live in Pittsburgh, don't take this gift for granted. To do so, would be a great dishonor.",

This looks like a traditional Pittsburgh diner but once you enter you will see how amazing the menu is and will get a diner experience unlike no other.

This past visit my date ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes complete with whipped cream with caramel drizzle, ice cream and hot baked applies. It was to die for!!  I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  For a True breakfast sandwich I had them hold the tomatoes, lettuce and mayo.  It was on fresh baked bread from the local bread company, Manconi, with cheddar cheese, scrambled egg and tasty bacon delicious!  The service is quick and they only take cash (PNC mac machine right outside).  There is always a line around the block on weekends so expect to wait although the line does usually move quickly.",

Just in case you forgot, the parking in the strip is terrible to say the least. We got there about 9:00 am. Sunday morning. The line was out the door and down the street. It took us about 30 minutes to get a seat. The portions were large and if you wanted huge portions, they had those options on the menu too. The sausage biscuit and gravy was lacking the sausage. There was only two small crumbles of sausage. The lobster bisque was lacking substance too. The taste was really good except that the few  pieces of seafood that were in it, were smaller than a grain of rice. I expected more. Our silverware was sad looking. I had to straighten my fork so all the prongs were even. It just seems like they are so busy that they quit caring about the quality. I don't know how this restaurant has been here so long and is still this busy.",

    "text": "Super greasy, dive inspired diner located in the strip district.  The choices are vast, but everything mostly tastes like low quality fat soaked all purpose man feed.  Yea, so there is some culture/history/tradition of greasy spoon diners of Pittsburgh, of which Deluca's may be the best, but in my opinion it is still not worth it.  Visit the spot, buy a t-shirt, take a picture, then go get some food somewhere else.  I went with some sort of sloppy breakfast option, with biscuits that came out rock hard and tasted like stale Bisquik.  The eggs were runny (not in the good way) and the cheese was plastic-esq American that had somehow managed to not melt, but instead quickly congeal into one stringy mass on top of my potatoes.   The coffee (while refilled many a time, my mug never saw the bottom) was watery and quite bitter.   So you may be thinking why the 2nd star, well the upsides of Delucas are the massive amount of food on the plate (quantity over quality should be the tagline), and the service was efficient and prompt, if not overly friendly. So this place is famous for something, I am not quite sure what, but it certainly isn't because they have good food.  If you manage to find out what makes Deluca's famous please let me know, until then I will not be returning.",

To make up for it our food came out quickly...I got the mixed grill with turkey sausage and my lady got the strawberry fields pancakes. Very rarely do we leave food on our plates but there was a little breakfast graveyard at the end of this meal. Everything was superb and we wanted to eat every last bite but it was impossible. 3 of us ate for less than $30 which rocks my socks!

    "text": "I've really wanted to like Deluca's but I just can't.  I've been here twice and it's been the same experience both times.  The wait to get into this place on the weekends is nuts.  I've gone during the week and while there isn't a line out the door, the staff inside always seems a bit disorganized.  Folks coming in are left standing between the register and the door while diners are trying to pay and get around you to leave.  That's logistical based on the layout of the place, so that's forgivable.  The food is my real issue here.  The portions are ridiculously huge and I feel like they opt for size rather than taste.  On this last visit, I ordered eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns tasted as though they'd been sprinkled with onion powder and then over cooked, which made the onion powder taste burnt.  Other than that, the only thing on my order with any flavor was the jelly I put on the toast.  My hubs ordered the mixed grill (again, ridiculously large) and a coffee.  The grill comes with a pound of veggies, and the hubs said the flavor was good.  However, he sat with an empty coffee cup for quite a while.  The service was sparse and the servers all looked like they'd rather be someplace else.  Which is understandable because about halfway through the meal, I wished the same.  I'm not planning on giving Deluca's another shot.  2 times is enough for me.  There are several other great breakfast places in the Strip (Kellly's and Pamela's to name a couple) and I think I'll stick to those spots.",

Those who know about Deluca's consider this time to be a miracle. The breakfast choices are a lot cheaper than any place I've been for brunch/breakfast in Pittsburgh. I ended up getting an omelette (avocado, sour cream) which came with hash browns. The omelette was very tasty and I probably will get it again when I go back. The hash browns were a nice addition as a side, not too soft. The waiter kept our waters full and the food came out quickly. Pro tip: restaurant is cash only to keep the prices low!",

We didn't want to wait for hours, so we called and got the food picked up. There was still a bit of wait, but nothing compared to standing in line. We got the food, and ate them in the car.   I would always lower my expectations about half a Yelp star for take outs, simply because it takes away the whole \"display food on plate\" and \"serving it glamorously to the customers\" thing. And also, food in a box doesn't always taste amazing. Surprisingly, everything we ordered was bomb. The portions were massive, and they were simply satisfying, perfect brunch material food. Only thing that went wrong was, they messed up our order.",

Coffee was good and kept coming while we waited and they have Franks hot sauce which is a huge plus for us. When the food came out everything seemed like big portions for the price which is good as well. Syrup went great with the pancakes and the chorizo in the omelette was amazing! Some things I wished could have been better was home fries could have been better or the server forgetting my toast for my omelette. Not deal breakers for any means just things left for wanting more. Overall I would say good experience for breakfast food in Pitts.",

Most recently, my boyfriend and I stopped in while doing some shopping in the Strip. We got there a little after 1, so it seemed like the breakfast/brunch crowd was done - in the mornings, the line can go out the door & down the block quite a bit! The menu is large and they have a selection of savory and sweet options, as well as breakfast & lunch items. For sweet, I like to get a short stack of pancakes with a fun topping (apples & cream = amazing!). Otherwise, omelettes are always a solid choice for a savory option. Never had a bad meal here!   Other info: cash only, ample seating inside, very pittsburgh-y decor!",

If you are in Pittsburgh, make your way down to Deluca's and enjoy some good food at a very reasonable price).

I was recognized immediately once I walked in nd everything my waitress offered was delicious. I orderd the Steel City Breakfast of Champs breakfast and it was soooooo good. Not to mention I got my money worth. I feel great and satisfied. They were very attentive with my order and I appreciated the conversation.

So we came later in the afternoon after walking around the Strip District.  As I was already full from our previous meal before coming here, my boyfriend was still hungry and decided to go for the bionic omelet.  He's not a small guy, but this omelet completely put him in a food coma. It was so big and filling, he was only able to finish about a third of it before throwing in the white flag.  Services is what you would expect at a diner.  We got there around 2:00pm and closing time was at 3. So it was pretty quiet in there.  Bathrooms were downstairs.  There were 3 stalls in the ladies room, but tell me why the bathroom door was open???  Prices were great. Would love to be back with an appetite and try out other items on the menu.

    "text": "I've driven past Deluca's Diner for over a year now, each time with the intention of eating there. Because I usually visit the Strip on the weekends, however, there would always be a (long) line outside of Deluca's. After asking a few potential patrons how long they have been waiting, to which their responses would be between 30 and 45 minutes, I just walked away.  Sorry, while I consider myself a patient guy, I can only last so long before I hulk out from hanger.  This is why I make a point of avoiding diners on weekend mornings, unless I have a snack before surrendering myself to the dreaded line.  Anyway, I finally had the chance to come here on a Wednesday morning with a friend for brunch. We found street parking without needing to circle around the area for half an hour and fume silently over endless pedestrians crossing the streets. As expected, there was a line, but it was nowhere near as long as that on weekend mornings. The people in front of us said that they've been waiting for 5-10 minutes. Not bad.  Within 10 minutes, the hostess seated me and my friend at a table near the back of the diner. The wall to which our table stood adjacent proudly displayed their achievements of being recognized by former Steelers players, and of being featured in movies and on \"Man vs. Food.\" Miscellaneous posters pertaining to Pittsburgh and diner-esque themes covered the rest of the walls.  Our waiter promptly introduced himself, gave us our menus, and asked if we'd like anything to drink. My friend requested water; I requested water and coffee. Within a few minutes, we had some water and I had my steaming mug of coffee. I usually take my coffee black, and this coffee was pretty good. After perusing the menu and debating whether we should get omelettes, pancakes or waffles or French toast, or breakfast sandwiches for almost 10 minutes, we finally made our decision. By this time, a waiter would have checked up on us at least twice; our waiter hadn't come by. We waited a few more minutes and eventually he came and took our orders briskly.  Within 10 minutes, we got our food. I got the Italian Veggie Frittata, my friend got the \"Da Burgh\" Philly Cheesesteak omelette, and we got full stack of French toast with strawberries. Our omelettes were excellent. Both of ours came with homefries and biscuits. My omelette with stuffed with veggies and a good amount of cheese, while my friend's was stuffed with juicy, tender steak, onions, and peppers. The homefries were all right. I came across several pieces that were undercooked and several pieces that were charred. I thought the biscuits tasted great but my friend thought that it must have been made using Bisquick because of their texture and taste. I didn't care; I just slathered my strawberry jam on them and stuffed my face.  According to the menu, the French toast is made using bread from Mancini's bakery. The toast itself was good, but the \"fresh\" strawberries on top brought down the dish. Upon arriving at our table, the strawberries lacked their vibrant red color; instead, they looked wilted and gray-red. I tasted one and I immediately thought \"defrosted frozen strawberries.\" It was so mushy and lacked any taste. I then proceeded to slide the strawberries off my piece of French toast before finishing it.  I guess I was loving the coffee because by the end of our meal, I had downed almost four cups of coffee! Whew, I knew I was going to be jittery today (with an overactive bladder).  Overall, our meal was good, but nothing really impressed me. I found the quality of the food to be that of a typical diner. Even the breadth of the menu wasn't too impressive. I've been to several diners with similarly extensive, if not more, menus. Nevertheless, I suppose DeLuca's gets a lot of attention and praise because it is a historical venue and a staple of Pittsburgh, just like Pamela's Diner.  Anyway, as for any diner, I would come here again if I woke up in the late morning with a hangover after a night of heavy drinking and couldn't will myself to cook my own breakfast/brunch. Just remember to be prepared for a long line and a long wait if you decide to go on a weekend morning. Bring a snack or a sports drink (and a sleeping bag for those who partied a bit too hard the previous night) to tide you over during your wait.",

That reason is because it's one of the best breakfast diners you'll ever have the privilege of sitting down at. The good far outweighs the bad, especially since you should already expect lines, and the fact that they only accept cash (which fits in perfectly with the old school diner ambience).  They. Have. The. Best. French. Toast. I. Have. Ever. Tasted.   Please don't think I'm exaggerating. I try not to do that when it comes to recommendations. I know that it sets people up for huge let downs. But the french toast here is on another level, in my opinion. Maybe I don't get out enough but I've never had such amazing french toast. You have to try it at least once. If you don't agree then I respect that. I'm also a breakfast food lover. I can eat it at all times of day. Please trust me!  Everything I had on my plate was good. I don't have any complaints because I knew exactly what to expect. Service was fast and courteous. It's been far too long since I've been back.",

We finally get in and to be honest I was ready for a let down another over hyped place that relied on its name rather than its food.  Thankfully I was wrong!  Menu is quite large there are alot of breakfast staples and some new twists on classics so there is something for everyone.  People are packed in a bit tight but I guess it beats waiting in line longer.  I got a eggs bacon and pancakes and my companion got the California omelette and a milkshake.  Food came out pretty quick and was really good and the portions were generous.    Definitely lived up to the hype and was high quality diner food.  Only let down was it being cash only.  I know its Pittsburgh and some places that still dont accept credit cards but for a place that is pretty centrally located and has people flock to from out of town I think they need to get with the times and fork over that 2% to the credit card companies.",

    "text": "I stopped by DeLuca's yesterday with CM for brunch at around 11am.  Initially, I tried to call and make a reservation, but they told me that they only accept reservations for parties of at least 5.  However, they also told me that business was a bit slower than usual yesterday.  I believe CM and I waited about 20-30 min. to be seated.  Neither of us had been before, despite having lived in PGH for 3.5 and 1.5 years, respectively.  For my entree, I debated between the fancy french toast and a heavenly pancake sundae, but I ultimately decided on the latter, due to the recommendations of other Yelpers and its Man vs. Food fame.  Despite not being someone who's super into apple pie, I decided to get the apple cinnamon roll pancakes, again due to others' recommendations.  When it came out, it looked impressive, and when I dug in, I was quite pleased with it.  The warmth of the canned apples complimented the cool creaminess of the ice cream perfectly, with the zest of the cinnamon taking it to another level.  Despite being an apple pie naysayer, this dish was delicious!  Obviously, it was very sweet, so if you're not into sweet breakfast foods, you may want to order something else.  CM was less adventurous than me and went with the short stack of pancakes with bacon.  I tried a bite of the bacon, and it was very crispy and minimally greasy, and was bursting with the smoked savoriness of well-made bacon.  This was certainly basic diner breakfast fare, perfected.  What impresses me about DeLuca's is the breadth and interesting options of the menu.  Although they have all of the usual breakfast standbys, they also have a variety of creative options for the more adventurously-minded, such as the heavenly pancake sundaes and the fancy french toast.  They also have some interesting options on the savory side, too, such as the bionic omelette.  Speaking of which, I love the sci fi-themed names that they give the items (out-of-this-world omelettes, sonic sides, etc.).  My only caveat is that if you're trying to eat on the healthier side, there aren't many options in that vein here.  (I'd recommend the Square Cafe in Regent Square for a more health-conscious breakfast.)  Despite the slight annoyances of the wait and the cash only policy, I'd recommend DeLuca's over Pamela's for a quintessential Pittsburgh breakfast--though I do enjoy Pamela's crepes.  Needless to say, it's a strong contender for one of the best traditional breakfasts in PGH.  Do your visiting friends a favor and be sure to take them here for a hearty meal before browsing the Strip or visiting Heinz History Center!",

I'm not sure whether I just have bad luck or if my expectations for food and service are high, but I don't think I'm asking too much when all I'm looking for is quality food and attentive waiters.  The first time I came to Deluca's I ordered one of their extravagant sweet pancakes. I was so excited for it, but was incredibly disappointed when I was instead served a burnt pancake that was barely edible... I'm not sure why you would even think it's okay to serve burnt pancakes, but needless to say, I was not impressed with Deluca's since then.   Fast forward to 2013 when I decided to give the place another try since there's always so much hype about this place. This time around, I tried the california eggs benedict. Was it hands down the most delicious eggs benedict I've ever had? Definitely not, but it was decent enough. I also ordered a strawberry banana milkshake, which was a great disappointment. I thought it tasted watery and expensive for the quality of the drink--I'm never getting that again.  There's always been a small line on Saturday mornings and they're cash only, so by no means am I itching to come back anytime soon. Also, they're always so busy that the service is subpar. Waiters are only there to grab your orders and have no interest in showing any appreciation for their customers. The wait for our check took forever as well because our server was inattentive.   Deluca's will do the trick if you need a breakfast place to go to but I've placed it dead last on my list. I've had much better experiences and great food in other places like Pamela's and the Original Pancake House.",

We got there around 10:30 a.m. on Sunday and were seated within about 15 minutes.  Not bad.  The menu was overwhelming.  So many omelettes! So many options!  I had no idea what to pick.  My friend saw Man v. Food and went for the mixed grill and I designed my own omelette.  The mixed grill was MASSIVE...pounds and pounds of veggies.  My omelette was pretty giant as well.  We ate and ate and barely made dents in our plates.  The food was decent for diner food.  I can't say it was the best I'd ever had but it's definitely a cool place to people watch and you can feel the history there.  The service was fast.  All in all a nice stop to try in the Burgh if you're super hungry.",

    "text": "I am in love with this place.   If you just want to get to the review about the food, skip this paragraph. If you enjoy the long, drawn out nostalgic reviews, read on:  Let me preface this by saying I have very mixed feelings on living in Pittsburgh. I find it hot or cold, and that goes for everything. The people, the night life, the restaurants, it's all a love/hate relationship for me. I rarely encounter anything where I'm just like, \"eh.\" There are things that make me love it here, there are things that make me hate it. I find people as nice as I found them back home in WV or absolutely the rudest EVER. The weather...ugh...don't get me started. So why am I telling you this? Because when I debate packing my things, selling my house, and moving away, I have a list of things I love (which are usually very simple things because that's the kind of person I am) that keep me here. They are things I know I'll never find anywhere else and things that make me love it here; the things I imagine give Pittsburgh it's awesome city rep, and this place is at the very top of that list.   This wasn't my first visit. The boyfriend and I walked in around 8am. We had just been to Home Depot and had a long day of yard work ahead. The last thing I wanted was to cook breakfast. We hopped onto 2 seats at the bar, as usual, and I ordered my usual, the Banana Split Crepe with a side of well done sweet sausage, and a coffee, and a water with lemon. It was astounding, and it always is. I take 2 bites of the sausage and take it home, every time. It's sweet and as lean as sausage could be and cooked to perfection. The coffee is perfectly brewed. The crepe is golden and delicious. The fruit is perfectly warm, the cheese too, and the toppings abundant. It's my favorite breakfast. I want to go on about the atmosphere though, because if the food were stellar and everything else sucked, I probably wouldn't return. The flip side is, the food could be mediocre (it isn't) and the rest would probably still bring me back.   We were greeted by a friendly tattooed waitress. We are tattooey too, and are always happy to patronize places that allow employees to look the way they choose (side note, that's why we Home Depot over Lowes, but that's another review).  Most of the staff here is sporting some ink, and black and white work side by side laughing and looking like they enjoy their job. I know Pittsburgh is known for it's diversity, so it may surprise you I mention that, but sometimes I find it to be quite the opposite. Not here. Not ever. Everyone smiles, everyone is friends, everyone is nice.  I was sitting next to a Jewish man, a table of young Asian students behind me, business men to my right, and old ladies dressed to the 9's across the way. Next to my boyfriend sat the waitress' well behaved young daughter, eating cut up banana and a milkshake. Cartoons were on, and I was cool with that. This is a place for everyone. I dig that the most.   As I'm drinking my coffee, waiting on my crepe, the restaurant is noisy. The radio is on. Prince comes on, and employee wiping down tables walks over and cranks it up. He's wiping and dancing, a few waitresses are dancing, too. We are laughing and dancing in our seats. The cooks on the line are nodding their heads.   Breakfast is delicious, the place has a pulse, and life is good. There isn't a face in the place without a smile on it. The boyfriend looks over and says \"this is the best f*cking omlette I have ever had.\" Our waitress laughs and tops off the coffee.   This is the Pittsburgh I was told about, and this is the Pittsburgh I love.",

    "text": "When a place has a line out the door on a cold January Sunday morning, it's a good sign about the food. We did end up waiting a while to be seated, but it was worth it to enjoy an old-school breakfast in this Pittsburg institution.  I got a veggie omelet which I thoroughly enjoyed; others in my party ordered diverse items from their extensive breakfast menu. From eggs to pancakes to the biggest ham slice any of us had ever seen, everything was well prepared and the service was great as well.  The atmosphere here is unique; the place is a bit (or a lot) of a time warp, which was fantastic in and of itself. This place knows what works, and has apparently just stuck with that, for decades.  Do check this place out- it's worth the wait!",

It is my favorite meal of the day so I get excited when I find a place that does it right.... unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed.   But, to be fair, I wasn't terribly disappointed either. I ordered chocolate chip and strawberry pancakes with whipped cream on them, scrambled eggs, and sweet sausage. My wife got that massive veggie and egg plate that they showed on MvF (I can't recall what it was). Both were acceptable, but underwhelming. My wife makes better pancakes and eggs, and the plate she ordered tasted under-seasoned.   It wasn't terribly expensive so I didn't feel that it was a total waste, but surely didn't think it was worthy of its claim of \"Best Breakfast in Pittsburg\". I also felt that the inconvenience of cash-only would make it not worth a return visit.  Also, the dining room is definitely not built for comfort. The tables were packed in so tight that we literally had to climb through another booth to get to our table and the benches were incredibly uncomfortable.",

I tried some of the hub's waffle with ice cream and whatnot on top...delish.

I am firmly in the latter camp, and I will be pleased to challenge Pamela's patrons to a duel, as long as I have been fueled by a breakfast burrito the size of my head and innumerable rounds of coffee.  Deluca's has quirks: It takes forever to get a table (because everyone's trying to eat there), the ambiance is old-school funky diner (weird mural, propensity for stickiness on the formica tabletop), and you should not expect to be pampered by the waitstaff (they do their job well, for the most part, but the restaurant is always busy, it's not a high-end place, and they aren't going to make enough in tip money off your $10 breakfast to put up with a snotty attitude from their customers).  Personally, I like this in a diner, and it is something I actively seek out.  I like to come here kind of hungover, devour a massive burrito and a huge orange juice and about three cups of coffee when the waitress has time to refill my cup.  My favorite diner is still that diner under the 16th street bridge, which I forget the name of it but it makes kick-ass biscuits and gravy.",

It took us at least a half hour or more to get in the door.  Every employee was running around like crazy and the kitchen floor was covered in food.  It was so busy that there was no time for them to clean.    The seating is cramped and there really is no ambiance.  I recommend ordering the pancakes featured on Man vs. Food to experience what the place is famous for.    The low score is due to the wait-time, cramped feeling when entering and sitting down at a table, and the overall craziness all around you while eating.

    "text": "After reading the reviews about the line and wait, we got here at about 8:00 on a Saturday morning and were seated right away. The menu is extensive and I was having a hard time choosing what to get. After some thought, I went with the strawberry pancakes and scrambled eggs. Breakfast sausage came with it but that went to my husband. He ordered a breakfast sandwich, after seeing the amazing bread it came on. One thing I liked was that they were really accommodating with making things just the way you want. My husband wanted scrambled eggs on his breakfast sandwich and that wasn't a problem! Service was quick and our food arrived shortly.  My pancakes were delicious, however I was disappointed with the strawberries-they were FROZEN! Well, thawed out but a mushy, pre-frozen strawberry mess! I understand this is a diner, but I guess in June I was just expecting some fresh strawberries. The eggs were good, nothing spectacular. My husband enjoyed his breakfast sandwich but said the sausage that came with mine was tough and he didn't eat much of it. We were in and out in less than 30 minutes.  Overall, it was a decent breakfast, but I would definitely order something different if I were to return. The service was fast and friendly, but I would have been disappointed if we had waited awhile for that breakfast.",

The sandwhich bread was well buttered but small compared to the large portion of egg, ham and cheese. The ham slab was overwelming so I removed at least half. Next time I will stick with just the egg and cheese sandwhich.  Cash only policy was a totally let down but the prices were good since its a dinner.",

There were tons of banana peppers but the amount of meat paled in comparison so I wasn't super happy about that. But it was good, just not good enough.   While we were seated very quickly, the food took a while to come out or I imagined it to be longer than it was b/c I was ravenously hungry...who knows. But maybe that's normal for this place.   I would like to check this place out again and try one of the pancake specialties. I saw folks around us getting what looked to be a pancake sundae - mmmm...sugar rush!   They had a ton of options which made it hard to choose what I wanted. Also the menu is quite busy (with graphics and colors and nonsense) which made it even more difficult to focus. When presented with so many options, I just feel scattered and couple that with visual distractions and I feel ADD.   While I may not opt for the omelet next time around I will be stopping by this place again to give it another try.",

    "text": "Deluca's is the ideal delicious, greasy spoon breakfast establishment.  It is not quite a diner, but it has that kind of vibe to it.  It's busy and a bit worn, but the menu encompasses a wide variety of breakfast and lunch items that has quite a following in Pittsburgh.  The weekend I went, the line crept out the door just after 10:00 am and was extremely long once my coworker and I got settled into our seats at the counter.  Who even has a legitimate counter space anymore to serve people?  The kitchen separates the two sections of counter seating and this is the heart of Deluca's.  If you can grab a seat there, do it.  From what I have read, this place has been featured on both the Food and Travel Networks and the whole time in which I was eating there, I felt like there should be a show devoted to this place's operation.  It was totally intruiging.  Up above the fryer and griddles was a huge plate of bacon to plate and send out with orders.  Egg shells were discarded wherever was away from a cooking surface and pancakes were shot out with a little dispenser to get them to a big, even size for the griddle.  It was magical.  How this place keeps orders straight, I have no idea.  Papers with orders are all over, but my meal came out correctly and so did my coworker's.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?  Service was extremely amiable even though they were swamped.  From the host to the counter girl, everyone was attentive and kind.  My coffee was literally bottomless--at no point was I sitting waiting for a fill up.  The coffee is not fantastic (a bit bitter) but it hits the spot and considering how many cups you can get in a sitting, it's the only flaw that I found of the place.   I orderd a short stack (two) of specialty pancakes: pumpkin.  The flavor was ever present without being overwhelming.  I also ordered scrambled eggs and they were pretty good as well.  They were not perfect, a bit moist, and I prefer eggs to be cooked a bit drier.  My coworker had kielbasa and really enjoyed it.  The meat looked so juicy and I regretted not getting some as well since I love that Polish sausage ohsomuch,  Overall, service is prompt and food is delicious.  I'm still thinking about it and would be willing to also wait on that really long line should I ever need to again to get some of that delicious breakfast again.  Oh, and if you're into cramming as much food as possible into you for a low price for breakfast, get one of the breakfast burritos.  They are bigger than your arm and filled with all sorts of good things.  The guy next to me had one and it was unreal.",

    "text": "De Luca's was featured on Man V Food - Pittsburgh. I had been going to this place since my junior year at CMU and I find it to be the best breakfast place I have ever eaten at. Whenever I go back to Pittsburgh to visit friends or for Steelers games, I always try and hit up Pramanti Brothers, William Penn for the the Kitchen Sink Wings and De Luca's for their breakfast.  Well. There is always a line to this place. I've seen it go around the block sometimes but there are also times when you can be the first in line. It all depends on what the crowd is like. This place specializes in breakfast but you can also get lunch food as well. You have to pay cash and you will most likely not find street parking anywhere near there so look for a lot or try the streets around it. The place is ALWAYS crowded so if you see some seats open at the bar, grab them cuz those are first come first serve.  Onto breakfast, I've tried a lot of their options but I love their Steak Mixed Grill. This gets me a sliced medium rare steak, 2 eggs over easy, veggies, sweet roast peppers, tomatoes and home fries. This meal was one of the dishes that Adam Richmond ate when he went there for Man V Food. I'll usually get this with a strawberry milkshake (which is enormeous) and that will completely fill me up.  I've also had the eggs benedict which is really good, the famous breakfast burrito (best breakfast burrito I've ever eaten), the buttermilk pancakes (better than Pamela's short cakes) and a Greek Omelette.  However, I now that I only go back to Pittsburgh once or twice a year, I usually just get the steak mixed grill. De Luca's is so much better than Pamela's and Pamela's is a really good breakfast place too. I definitely love coming here.",

Survive the line at the door? No sweat. 20 min is nothing to me. I live in Asia now, people. It's the land of queues. Hell, people wait in line simply because there is one, even if they have no idea what it's for.   Order the massive breakfast burrito? Of course.  Was it bigger than my face? Check.  Was it delicious? Double check.  (Although, if I had one criticism, it would be put less potatoes inside and more egg. And that slice o' American cheese on top added nothing...)  Ice cream for breakfast? Yessssss!  Cinnamon bun hotcakes offered a delicious sugar rush, with fluffy pancakes topped with ice cream, whipped cream and delicious gooey apples and pecans. I only wish there were more apples. And pecans... And pancakes. 2 was not enough.   Okay, the breakfast was tasty but not as amazing as Adam made it seem. But maybe Adam makes everything look tastier...  (oh, you know you love him too!!!)",

I watched them systematically clean up, re-seat, and keep it moving. Their hustle and bustle is an art in itself.  But for them to be as attentive, letting us know the status of the table, just kept sort of checking up with us as we stood there, it was pretty impressive... Then our Waitress was smiling thru my kids changing their minds and all their city slicker requests for this and that on the side. Appreciated her patience... She checked up during meal at the right times. And she had a quick chat with us before she handed the check over. She was just real nice.... Some of the best restaurants in the world could learn from this pretty humble easygoing waitstaff.   Food: it was everything you expected, wanted and more. Everything was pretty much perfect for a diner. Waffles were fluffy and perfectly cooked. Home fries were delicious. And their version of eggs Benedict was amazing.

Aside from that I got the pumpkin pie crepe which was great!  Overall, it's too expensive. The bill was $21.00 for eggs, bacon, and a filled crepe.  I will not be coming back.",

Also the size is so large, so it's suitable for hungry people! Really awesome!  If you can come here on weekdays, the restaurant is very good for you to have breakfast or brunch. If you are only available on weekend, come here as early as possible (maybe before 7:00am), because I don't think it's worth to wait for more than 30 mins even though I give it 4 stars.",

Trying to be healthy, I ordered the Greek omelette and asked to make it with egg whites. For $11.99 (+$1 for egg whites), this delicious creation comes with spinach, tomato, feta and asiago cheese, and choice of steak or chicken; I went with the chicken. Wow, this thing was good! One of the best omelets I've had in a long time, and I don't usually do the egg white thing. The home fries, cooked to crispy perfection, were also excellent.  Service was top notch  and the old school diner ambiance is a fun experience. 5 stars for an excellent breakfast.",

We sort of expected something special but it was more like Alice's Diner. Old booths, old equipment and old grease mist floating in the air making it hard to breath.      To be honest the food was good but average. Not worth all the TV excitement or driving more than a mile or two for. And not as good as other places near by.      The service was good and pretty fast.       All in all it was an average meal, in an average diner. I will say that some of the lunch menu items sounded more interesting.",

Likewise, I can never decide on the sweet sausage or the hot sausage, and typically just order a side of whichever I don't get with my mixed grill breakfast.  There is ALWAYS a line up here so plan accordingly. As well, service can be extremely slow (as it was this past Saturday) but some things are worth the wait.

Decided to go all protein first and leave the carbs for last, which ended up being the best option; I had to get a to-go-box, hoping to encounter a hungry homeless man.

I ordered the Huevos Ranchero with refried beans and was NOT disappointed. Massive serving and the taste was fantastic.

    "text": "This is the ultimate diner, from the intimidating long but quickly moving line that sprawled several store lengths along the sidewalk to the frazzled hostess and the no-nonsense wait staff. This cash-only establishment harkens back to the time when people entered a diner to eat and keep going with their busy day rather than to lollygag while Instagraming pretty but quickly cooling plates of food.   We walked to The Strip from our hotel to check out the scene with two establishments in mind for breakfast. We were starving. So we initially passed by the long line at Deluca's to find our other option. But when chaos was the order of the day there, we hightailed it back to the end of the line at Deluca's. All in all, we waited roughly 25 minutes and met some very nice people with whom to chat.   Upon being seated, our waitress immediately served us coffee and water and then gave us plenty of time to peruse the huge menu of offerings. I ended up choosing the Veggie Burrito, even though I wasn't particularly in the mood for Mexican(ish) food and Loverboy ordered his go-to - a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich with a side of hash browns. The bustling diner has all of the expected cliches; the nice waitresses spare few words of conversation beyond taking your order, line cooks call out plates when completed, and the food is served piping hot on plates that are likely older than me. Our coffee cups were never empty thanks to an attentive waitress and we dug into our meals happily.  Loverboy polished off his sandwich in record time. He clearly was hungry and appreciated the local bread. I was very pleased with the Veggie Burrito; although, I was initially intimidated by the sheer size of it. Do not expect a dainty dish. It's a huge flour tortilla chocked full of grilled veggies, scrambled eggs and potatoes, topped with a slice of cheese and a mysterious red sauce that was slightly spicy and to-die-for! After some persistence and a break or two, I managed to clean my plate. Granted, there were a lot of veggies. So I wasn't bursting at the seams. But I certainly had no intention of eating lunch anytime soon.  The check was left on our table after a final check-in from our waitress and we paid at the register prior to leaving. This was one of the best diners we've visited. It's plain, simple, no-frills food that tasted great. Stop in if you get a chance. Don't let the line scare you away. It's worth a short wait.",

I was pleasantly surprised to find open since it was a holiday.  This is definitely a greasy spoon type joint which is definitely part of the charm. However, the prices didn't reflect this.  When I think dirty little diner I normally think affordable food.   I ordered blackberry pancakes and bacon. I was surprised when I was just given a normal short stack and some blackberry jam on the side. The food was just okay. Nothing special. I did appreciate that the portions are HUGE. But for the price I paid for the meal I could have spent that same money somewhere else got a higher quality dish.  Over all I was disappointed in Delucas but if you're in the strip District and want over priced diner food this is the place for you.",

There's no waiting space inside, so it's not as long as you'd think, but it's usually a wait.  Once inside, the place is dark and diner-y.   While that was what I was looking for, it was also really hot in there, which was a downer.  My area was also quite sticky, which didn't really work for me either.    Service was quick and efficient - what you would expect of a busy diner.  When it's time to pay, you have to go to the front, where it is Cash Only.   Annoying, but ok.      The food was where they really lost me though.   I ordered the eggs, kielbasa, home fries, and toast.  The toast was the best thing I got.  The eggs were overdone.  The potatoes underdone.  The kielbasa was browned on the outside, but cold on the inside.  Overall, a poor performance on a standard breakfast.",

The potatoes are buttery and delicious, the hot cakes are of perfect consistently and aren't overwhelmingly sweet, and the meat is just amazing / flavorful. The sausage, egg, and potato breakfast might be my favorite selection of theirs because of the simplicity and freshness of each ingredient. My only warning is that, if you try to go to DeLuca's at peak hours, be prepared to wait for a loong time in line as they do not have reservations. Even with the immense popularity, the wait staff remain quick and friendly. I recommend DeLuca's to anyone, and I can't wait to come back!",

The place had certainly died down from the brunch craziness so we were able to be seated immediately. Huge menu = indecisive me however I ordered simple - eggs, meat (chorizo), homefries and toast along with one hotcake and some coffee. The breakfast was delicious with ample portions and for relatively affordable price about 7 bucks then 2 for the hotcake. Server was nice and checked in periodically - the wait staff that we interacted with were all friendly. While Deluca's is a diner and I expect some grease, I felt their floors were a little much as I had to make sure I wasn't sliding when walking out the door. I would come back to Deluca's though would go elsewhere if the line was long. Good but not an hour wait long good.",

I expected it to be greasy, and it was. No problem there. However, the steak was dry, overcooked, and the whole meal was bland. I still finished it, but I was expecting better. Maybe I should've tried something else???  Anyone have a suggestion of the next dish to try the next time I go back?",

The hours are weird, though they're open into the mid-afternoon. I liked Deluca's UNTIL I discovered JoJo's, which is nearby, but closes at noon. Now, Deluca's feels second rate, because I'm an eggs, meat, and potatoes person more than a griddle dude.  If it was the other way around, Deluca's might be my favorite.",

I was asked 4 times if I was ready to order while my while my face was planted in the menu, patently pondering the choices.  I had a difficult time getting water. I made eye contact with one employee who then just kept walking; I took it that he will only bus tables.  My coffee was burnt, though after a while a nice lady came around and when I explained this she said that \"yeah, the decaf is blacker\".  No, burnter.  But she did bring me a fresh cup of regular.  The food was pretty good, though not exactly what I ordered.  The turkey sausage was somehow watery; I marvel how they accomplished that.  Most of the staff was friendly and my dining guest thoroughly enjoyed his meal, so again I'd say it's worth at least one trip.  Maybe you'll enjoy it more.",

First things first, you're going to have to wait in line to get seated, there's usually no way around it, but TRUST ME it's well worth the wait! DeLuca's advertises \"Best Breakfast in town\" and they strongly back up that statement with their food!  For people who live the fitness lifestyle like myself not eating what you want can be torturous! DeLuca's does however offer up some meals to suit fitness conscience people with offering their \"BodyBuilders Breakfast\". But you better believe that when I'm in DeLuca's it's time for a cheat meal! I usually go with a Hot Sausage, Egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on Manci's Italian Bread. Then I dive into an order on their amazing hot cakes! Usually the Rece's cup or Cinnamon Bun.   Overall take it from a Yinzer and try this place out",

It was fun to watch the kitchen work.  Really makes you appreciate the cooks and the food when you see how hard and fast they are working.  I ordered \"THE CALIFORNIA\" omelette, it is quickly becoming my favorite.  It's an omelette loaded with avocado, tomatoes, spinach, sweet roasted red peppers, pesto chicken, and swiss cheese.  The ingredients are very fresh and not as heavy since it's essentially meatless.  They move their customers in and out at a quick pace.  Don't be intimidated by the line. Service is fast and efficient!",

    "text": "What can I really say about DeLuca's that hasn't been said before by others (and more eloquently, at that)?    We don't have a place like this in Baltimore, exactly.  Yes, there are great breakfast joints here, but ... I can't say that they serve up food quite like what we experienced at DeLuca's.  A pancake dish that looks suspiciously like a huge apple pie with mountains of whipped cream can't be bad in anyone's book - certainly not in mine.  I can hear my friends in Baltimore going, \"But-but-but... what about Blue Moon Cafe?  What about their Captain Crunch French toast?  But-but-but...\"  Nope.  Sorry.  DeLuca's blows the Captain away, sails and all.  This place is better.  A thousand times better.    For one thing, DeLuca's has a menu that's about 100 times bigger than what Blue Moon offers.  The only things you come there for is the Sweet Baby Jesus and the Captain Crunch toast - and yeah, they're great for what they are.  But at DeLuca's?  A massive burrito the size of your forearm (aptly named the Mutha of All Burritos, or MOAB), the daily special cheeseburger omelet (which is what I ordered here), a pancake sundae (yes, SUNDAE - buckwheat pancakes with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge drizzles, cherries, whipped cream in peaks the size of the Appalachians)... how can Blue Moon even begin to compare with this?  Answer?  It can't.  It simply can't.    Massive respect for the staff here.  I can't even begin to describe the way they're flying around in this tiny-assed little kitchen, serving dish after dish after dish after dish of this insane goodness.  This place only seats 90 people at a time, folks - it's damn near as hard to get in here as it is Blue Moon, that's for sure.  There's always a line.  Be prepared to wait, and be prepared not to complain.  You're going to wait - simple as that - and it's going to be freaking worth every minute.  Grab a book, a lawn chair, play some Candy Crush or whatever, pass the time.  Dream of the huge Appalachian whipped cream mountains you're about to eat.  Really.  If you're willing to sit at the counter instead of a table, you're likely to get in here a lot faster.  Everything was on point, from the coffee to the food to the service.    The only downside is that, like most places seem to be in the P'burgh, this joint is cash only.  I don't understand it, but hey, hit up the ATM.  This place is worth the hassle.  If you're going to stop for breakfast in Pittsburgh in only one place... this is it.    We will be back.  That's not a maybe - that's a will.  We WILL be back.",

The staff was amazing and the whole place runs like a machine.  We got there ~9:15 and there were about six groups ahead of us, but we didn't wait long since they're exceptionally fast at getting tables cleared and ready for the next party.  An empty plate never sat longer than a few seconds and our coffee was always full.   I ordered way too much food, as usual:  Sausage gravy and biscuits with scrambled eggs and potatoes with an extra single \"fancy pancake\" with lingonberries.  My husband ordered some sort of breakfast burrito which I didn't try.    The sausage gravy and biscuits came out first and they were AMAZING.  The side of eggs and potatoes and the pancake came out about five minutes later; not really a biggie, but I'm not really sure if they just forgot and threw it together when I asked where it was because the eggs almost seemed like somebody started to make fried eggs and then decided at the last second that they should be scrambled.  They were runny and yolky in spots and white and fried-eggy in other spots (pretty much exactly like you would expect a chopped-up fried egg to look).  Maybe this is the way that they always are, but it was really unappetizing.  The pancake was also off somehow.  I looked around at everybody else's pancakes and they were light and fluffy, but mine was deflated with an almost rubbery texture.  It's like they used crepe batter, but it was thicker than I would expect a crepe to be.  The potatoes were good, but nothing remarkable.  Maybe my expectations were just too high...",

When I got a table, it took awhile for my grumbling waitress to take my order, but I had plenty of time to observe the cooks throwing food and plates around, food covering the floor, overwhelmed servers and the interesting mural on the wall. My pankakes were good. The bacon, sausage, potatoes and breakfast burrito was not good. There are much better diners in Pittsburgh that are much cleaner and have more satisfying food. Don't worry, there are places in town with a better breakfast, hands down.",

We ordered an assortment of pancakes, waffles, eggs, and more by let me leave you the highlights; Italian toast, waffle sundae, hash browns, and chocolate milkshake.

We beat the rush by about 10 mintes. At 910 there was a line with about 30 people in it. The line seemed to move fast but be aware it gets busy.   The food was very good. I asked for a cup of sausage gravy and I got a bowl for the cup price. Also had a bacon omelet that was very large. You can't go wrong with Deluca's on Penn Ave. In the heart of Pittsburghs strip district with many shopping options after you fill your belly with good food at a reasonable price.",

The menu has both breakfast and lunch items. I ordered scrambled egg whites, raisin toast, and fruit. My boyfriend ordered a philly cheese steak omelette.  Overall, service was quick and friendly. However, this restaurant is a bit unsanitary.  I was watching them bus tables and they actually pick the butter and jelly packets that are unused and separate them. Basically, they pick through someone else's food and then put the butter back on your clean plate. I'm not sure if they sanitize the butter and jelly packets, but I would guess they do not.  Overall the food was really good, but I would probably skip this if you're looking for something a bit cleaner.  Oh and Adam Richman did an episode here. You can sit in the seat he sat in which has a little plaque.",

The service is very friendly and has a very old school diner feel. It's a quick paced dinner with a lot going on. There's a lot of commotion of the cooking and people eating. It's a super fun place to eat breakfast.  As far as the food goes, it's all good. I ordered the pancakes, turkey sausage, bacon, eggs, hash potatoes and a side of toast. It was three plates of food. So good, I finished it all. My husband ordered their corned beef hash and I loved his order as well.",

Adam Rickman was at DeLuca's in 2008 and this place is another Pittsburgh institution so as two slightly hung over and hungry people, Wifey and I got in the car and made our way over to the Strip to experience this place.   Now, we came a little late so there wasn't the normal line and we were seated immediately. Our waitress got us water and coffee quickly and she was AWESOME. Really nice, knew the menu, and dropped off our check before she got sent out on break (wish I remembered her name).   So I ordered the Steel City Breakfast (short stack pancakes, two eggs fried hard, bacon, kielbasa, potatoes and toast). Wifey had the Hotcake Special (Short stack of pancakes, crispy bacon Scrambled eggs). Neither of us could finish our meals. It's a LOT of food. The pancakes were excellent and they serve great coffee here too.   Every hour I'm here I find something else to love about this city and DeLuca's with our fun, engaging waitress certainly helped!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delucastripdistrict.com%2Fnemu&s=e67fbba6cf6b94b08ac0723167f254a08fc228ad58ee94420b4ced8cf8475d19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">delucastripdistrict.com/...</a>",

Today we arrived around 10:50 on a holiday Monday and had no wait. My family ordered a Nutella banana crepe, the seafood omelette and the seafood Benedict. The crepe comes with a while banana in the middle of the crepe; the crepe is then slathered with Nutella and rolled up similar to a burrito. It's covered in powdered sugar and whipped cream. My son loved it and said it was similar to others he had on Germany. The seafood Benedict came with shrimp, crab, and lobster. The poached egg was just a tad runny but nothing to stress about. The taste was great.   I will continue to come back here on each trip to the Burgh! It's definitely worth it.",

You literally sit down and see the whole kitchen staff cook non-stop amounts of fresh eggs and pancakes like there was no tomorrow all while yelling and people moving everywhere and a huge line out the door. Just tons and tons of fresh eggs and pancakes coming out to feed everyone. The food here is delicious, authentic, fresh, hot (literally), and everyone's favorite part INSANELY CHEAP! I ate so much food and a nice quality cup of coffee for just $11.00. True story!   This is one of those places that you have to visit and experience for yourself. I cannot say enough good things about this place! If I lived in the city I would be here every weekend. Haha!  Pro Tip: The later in the morning you come the bigger the lines get outside. The lines get huge, like seriously. Come in around 9AM to 10AM and you will be alright!",

    "text": "Went around 8:30am Sunday during Memorial Day Weekend and only waited 5 minutes to be seated. Tables turn over relatively quickly, so don't be too discouraged by a long line! You can also call ahead for reservations. I'd suggest calling ahead if you're a party of more than four - most of the tables and booths are four-tops and counter seating.  We opted to go here instead of Pamela's since they had a wider variety of breakfast options, along with more flexibility to sub-out sides.  The service was great: coffees were always topped off, servers attentive, and the kitchen was quick to get food out once our order was placed. I had the short stack of 2 pancakes with a generous serving of egg whites (and they weren't bland!) and a cup of sliced bananas - the server was kind enough to let me know that the fresh fruit wasn't ripe enough to be enjoyable, so she sliced up bananas for me instead! Husband had the Steel City Breakfast of Champs - and you should be considered a champion for finishing this meal! French toast were huge slices, eggs generous portion, two pieces of meat (the turkey sausage was very tasty), and potatoes well seasoned. Our breakfasts were so filling, we didn't even have lunch that day!  Tasty breakfast. Affordable meal. Quick service. Mom & pop environment. EAT HERE. (And bring CASH!)",

    "text": "I stopped in here after discovering this place walking in the strip. I rolled in on a Sunday morning around 830am there wasn't much of a line but on walking in we where told it was a five minute wait between seatings cause they where missing a few cooks on the line. Once we did get a seat it was a long wait for our food and it's understandable being how short staffed they where. The menu was very large and seem to offer a lot of good stuff. I got the French toast platter with eggs meats and potatoes. The French toast was very basic and the eggs where cooked good being poached. The potato's weren't to soft and the sausage was juicy but the bacon was to over cooked for me. One major thing to mention that left a super bad taste in my mouth with this place is the the two guys cooking on the flattop kept arguing with another worker who kept going up to them and it was loud swearing and arguing. I just think it was super unprofessional and uncalled for as there was little kids around and other people trying to enjoy breakfast. I'm not sure if this is a all the time thing there but it's not a good thing with having a open kitchen and guest sitting right there. I won't be returning here after this experience.",

Nope.  The menu was gigantic -- as big as the portions.  The cinnamon bun hotcakes with the warm, gooey, sweet apples, glazed pecans, and gratuitous whipped cream and vanilla ice cream?  Surprisingly great -- just a great balance of flavors and textures.  The only misfire was on the cheesesteak omelet -- it was supposed to come with a sauce.  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he thought it needed one, too -- but didn't know that it did.  Not a big deal that he didn't know -- just that it did need something.  Eh, I had the hotcakes to share anyway; there was plenty of food on the table.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh.  I'd be 50 pounds heavier.  FYI cash only.",

It's located in the heart of the Strip District, so there was a ton going on the day we ate here. The food is very good and the portions are huge. I'd recommend going early to avoid the long waits. And note that they only accept cash, no credit cards.",

My fiance brought me here one day during the summer when I went with him to PGH to visit his family. We heard about the rave reviews on Man vs. Food so we decided we had to hit up all of Adam Richman's picks in PGH during our trip. We waited in line in the warm sun for about 20-30 minutes to be seated, but it was well worth it! My fiance had the mixed grill - loaded with grilled veggies, potatoes, and spicy sausage. We kept switching plates back and forth because we just couldnt decide who got the best meal. Both the pancakes and the mixed grill were HUGE! We could barely finish both. Inexpensive and good service. We'll defintely be back when we visit PGH again!",

How can you not expect to eat to your heart's content when someone tells you that their pancakes come with ice cream and whipped cream, and look more like something out of Willy Wonka's factory then a griddle.  Everything on the menu reads simply: pancakes, burritos, waffles, shakes, etc.  Not too much flash, but the ensemble of food layered on top of food that is finally delivered to your table will knock out whatever hunger you brought in.  Depending on when you come, you are going to have to wait, but it is definitely worth it.  Try not to fumble around with menu once you get seated, best is the look at it in line, decide, and prepare.  Prepare mentally and physically for this meal.  Everything on the menu is good.  Trust me you will not leave without feeling like that was the best breakfast ever.  And please do try to tackle something interesting on the menu.",

Very good, the kielbasy was not like any I had before, I suppose all kielbasa has it's own local flavor.  Interesting people watching, from the locals, tourists, tattooed staff and Pittsburgh's finest.   Everything is cooked behind a low counter - you can see all the activity - looks crazy back there.  The booths are not very comfortable, straight backed and Formica topped (adds to the charm?)  There is a strange mural on the wall, Greek mythology themed with Pan and others, labeled as a prop from the movie \"Passed Away\".  Really enjoyed it, would go back and recommend to others.  Fun and funky area to shop too.",

Don't like it?  Fuck you, that is ambiance here!  The place is, almost always, packed to the rafters (especially at breakfast time).  You will wait for a table.  The wait staff is typically old and cantankerous.  You will hear the query \"whatta ya want, honey\".  But the food is plentiful and out of this world.

Everything on the menu and other people's plates looked absolutely amazing, so it was hard to choose what to order.   I ended up selecting the Reese's Cup, which is one of their many Hot Cake Sundaes. The Reese's Cup was two very large hotcakes with peanut butter chocolate chips cooked inside. It also had chocolate ice cream, chocolate syrup, caramel topping, honey roasted pecans, and whipped cream on top.   Although I didn't really feel like I was eating breakfast, I didn't really care because it was so good.   Deluca's is delicious, unique, and has a ton of variety on the menu.

    "text": "I always enjoy my visits to pittsburgh. I was especially excited to visit after finding out there was a great place for breakfast that was on the travel network (man vs. food). I am a True food lover and Food Network and Travel Channel must really love pittsburgh. They are always on man vs food and diners, drive ins and dives.  I found out the hard way that just because you are showcased on a dandy show doesn't mean your food is up to par.  Just to make it very clear I am a southerner. I did however go to delucas with my girlfriend who was born and raised in pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. So I was able to look past the brash attitude of the person at the register yelling at my girlfriend instead of seating us. She however was pretty turned off by it.  There wasn't a wait. We got seated pretty quickly after my girlfriend had to let the lady know we were there well before the ambush of people that poured in after we arrived. (that's when my girlfriend got yelled at)  After being seated I was really excited about the food. The place was hoppin and the coffee was really good. The menu had a huge list of things to choose from. I thought it was going to be a great place. I had really high hopes. The server we had was ok. Not very friendly but efficient. She was the shorter of the two I saw. We kind of wished we had the tall girl. She seemed a lot more friendly.  We didn't wait too long to get our food but when we got it you would have thought it would have taken a couple hours. I got the biscuits and gravy (one of my favorite breakfast foods) and potatoes. They were both stone cold. The gravy on the biscuits was more like a soup and the potatoes were well cold. I really couldn't get passed the fact that my food was cold.  My girlfriend got the california omelette with potatos and fruit with the Italian toast. She like the fruit and toast but that was it. I almost choked on my sausage gravy when I saw her omelette. It was practically black. I know sometimes people over cook eggs. It's not cool but it happens. How do you even send eggs out that are practically black. I guess at least it was hot. Her potatoes needless to say were also cold. I was really looking forward to eating at a delicious breakfast place in pittsburgh. I was disappointed.",

They were definitely efficient and had great service.  A lot of the breakfast menu items looked like they belonged on a dessert or ice cream parlor menu, rather than a diner. I had huevos rancheros.  The crumbled chorizo was salty enough to choke a horse and there was a lot of it, I wouldn't recommend it.  Another person with us had the breakfast burrito, which he said was overly filled with mismatched odds and ends.  He took the half he couldn't eat there and finished it later.  Our other companion had something else in a burrito and took half of that home also. In my opinion Deluca's needs to focus more on quality and less on quantity.  Maybe the pancakes and waffles are better, but we didn't have them.",

    "text": "I always made fun of all the people standing in line on the weekend mornings waiting to have breakfast at DeLuca's that was until I found myself waiting in that same line. I happened to be in Pittsburgh for the weekend visiting friends when it was suggested to try the place out. There had to be 30 or so people in line waiting to get into the place on a Saturday morning. It probably took 30 to 45 minutes to get to the front but the plus side is there is a coffee shop a few doors down to get something warm to drink. When we finally got it we were seated at the counter which was a fine place to sit considering you can watch all the cooks running around like crazy turning out food by the minute. There are lots of things that look good but I settled on an omelet with a bunch of vegetables and covered in three kinds of cheese that was downright awesome. My friend also had some combination of eggs and veggies which he proceeded to polish off something I could not do. We were also witness to a few people tackling the pancakes with the sundae on top. Good luck with that on early morning. I am not sure it is the best breakfast in town but it is certainly worth the wait especially if it's not too cold outside. I will be back.",

I liked Deluca's food and selection, but their booths are the most uncomfortable seating I have had in years.  Deluca's is one block away from Pamela's in the strip.  Comparing the two: Pamela's food is better, their prices are lower and the seating is much more comfortable, Deluca's menu is larger, both have long waits on weekends.  If you are in the strip, there is no reason to go to Deluca's, go to Pamela's.",

The place can use a make over, but I thought it was charming and you went back in time with the red and white checkered floors, and what looked liked original counter and green worn leather stools.  The staff was nice and friendly too.  I stayed at the Westin Hotel and it was about a 10 block walk (1 mile).  My husband and I shared the Steeler breakfast plate and it was one of the best breakfests we had.  It was a good thing we shared bc it came with 2 toasts, 2 (8\") pancakes, 1 (5\") sweet sausage, 2 slices bacon, home fries, 2 eggs.  Every item was cooked perfect and the pancakes were the best I had at a restaurant, a bit crispy and fluffy inside.   Too bad we were so full and couldn't finish the pancakes and toast.  Everything else we finished with a smile.  The portions are large.  We had 2 cups of very good coffee and the Steeler special and our bill was $12.  A bargain for all we had.    If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I would go there again and try more of the resturants on the Strip District.",

I got here about 10 am this morning and totally expected a long line.  We only had to wait about 5 minutes and got a great booth in the back.  If you're in a rush sit at the counter.  Service was friendly, quick and professional.  Place was packed with all types, classes and colors.  Everyone from family's after church to folks like me with disheveled hair wearing the same clothes from  the long night prior.  This offers a True snapshot of the folks of my fine city.  I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs with a side of sweet sausage and toast.  The corned beef hash was great charred perfectly and tons of flavor.  The eggs were about average and the sweet sausage was amazing.  They offer a ton of breakfast meat options, everything from chorizo to amish ham and sweet sausage.  My breakfast was a little above average, however my friend made a much better choice.  She ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was great.  It was served on fresh italian bread with mounds of cheese and crispy bacon.  I like Pamelas for pancakes, but for just True good diner breakfast food this is my new favorite.",

I've only had eggs Benedict type breakfast plates and shakes there, but I've been with others who have tried different options. Everything else was described as \"good, typical breakfast food.\"  Sometimes there is a wait (especially on weekends), but service is usually pretty quick and generally pretty good. They aren't the nicest or friendliest servers. They're not rude, and they are good at their jobs. They typically won't sit at your table and chat, but they are quick and usually don't mess anything up.   If you like a lot of different options for breakfast food, Delucas is the place to go.",

Also, it should be noted, it's kinda touristsy , by that I mean actual tourists, and weekend tourists in from the suburban cultural wastelands for a authentic Pittsburgh breakfast, like their parents ate, or some such nonsense, so that also means it's pricey for the straight off the Sysco truck food that it is.  I'm giving this place 5 stars based solely on the absolute ticket slayers that are on open display on the short order line set up they have there, these men are a joy to watch, and the speed at which they got the orders out was honestly pretty impressive, hats off to these cooks!   Total bad asses!!!! That, and the waitress was really nice too!",

It turns out that there were only groups of 4 ahead of us (I was a party of 2) so the people said we could probably go in and grab the 2 empty seats at the counter..score! So we went In and asked a waitress if we could just sit at the counter and she said we had to wait our turn in line. We explained that there was no one waiting to sit at he counter but apparently it didn't matter.  So we waited another 15 mins to sit at a booth and then soon after we sat, a group that was literally right behind us sat at the counter. So that was annoying. Not sure why they wouldn't have a system to write your name down. The workers seemed annoyed that customers coming in kept asking if they need to just wait or put their name in.  The food was a generous portion, enough for a second breakfast! But after I left, I smelled SOOOO greasy all day. I couldn't get home to shower. So be prepared to smell like grease as soon as you walk in.",

I must say they did a great job with getting people in and out pretty quickly. The menu was a bit messy though. They tried to make it look more fun, but I thought it was just confusing.   After orienting myself to the menu, I decided to settle for the Californian omelet with chipotle pesto chicken, asiago cheese, spinach and avocado. The omelet came with two slices of toast. The omelet was just ok. I didn't think it was anything special. They were pretty stingy on the avocado. There wasn't enough sauce and the chicken was dried. Honestly, I didn't think the omelet was worth $12. The side of homemade fries was super plain. The Lyonnais potato at Pamela's is so much more flavorful. My dinning companion ordered the apple cinnamon bun pancake sundae. It looked delicious when it came out with a huge scoop of ice cream on top. The ice cream melted fast and left a giant puddle on the pancakes. The pancakes were delicious, but the sogginess from the melted ice cream really ruined it. It was good the first few bites, but not something I can finish.   Overall, I had a good dinning experience at Deluca's, but I did not think this place is worth all the hype. Though, I'm willing to come back and try something else on the menu, hoping maybe I ordered all the wrong stuff the first time.",

The quality and taste of the food is not as good as it should be for the amount of time you will spend standing in line waiting for a table on a Saturday or Sunday at breakfast/brunch time. It's cool to watch the line cooks make your food, but it's almost stressful to watch the servers and cooks running around, yelling orders, and wiping sweat off their brows.

The waitress was not flustered at our large group and accommodated our party with a professional flair. All the food was hot and served us almost all at the same time!  Couldn't finish.  Wanted to.

I had actually gone on Sunday but saw the line was out the door so ended up going somewhere else. On a Monday at 11 am I didn't think it be so bad. My friends and I were seated quickly. There was a lot of options, I couldn't decide between the pancakes or the breakfast of champions. Went with the breakfast of champions and couldn't believe how much food it was. I imagined a short stack of pancakes would be small. It was two huge pancakes that I barely finished it. As I write this it is still my only meal of the day, still full haha. My friends loved the place and I'm so glad I saved the best for last. Please come to this place if you visit Pittsburgh or if you live in Pitt and have never visited. Oh and I think its cash only but not too sure. If you are a fan of pancakes as much as I am then this won't matter at all :)",

I had a veggie breakfast burrito, the man had a more traditional breakfast. The burrito was .  . . edible. It was enormous, big enough to feed me for a day and still have leftovers. Inside a soggy tortilla I had mounds of scrambled eggs and about 2 pounds of vegetables - onions, peppers, avocado, tomato, hashbrowns, and then some. Most of the vegetables tasted very, very steamed, and then doused in grease. There wasn't much taste to them at all, and I love my vegetables. It makes me sad someone discovered a way to make them taste so uninteresting. On top of the whole affair was their spanish sauce (tomato paste?) and an unmelted square of orange cheese-like product. All in all, it didn't taste bad, but that's not high praise for restaurant food.  His breakfast was easily as big, and looked much better than mine tasted. The waitress got the order close, but not quite right, and he didn't have the interest to send it back. It was good, but too greasy for him to eat very much of it.  If it were cheaper I would say it was a good value. As it stands, I would go if someone really wanted to go there, but if its left to me there are many other places I'd go for breakfast first.",

The service here was not impressive and satisfactory at best. The line was out the door and down the street for over an hour. When we finally got into the building I noticed many empty seats at clean tables and no one sitting people. if the line is that long, there should be someone dedicated to sitting people. The coffee here was okay, I can say I get better coffee from my keurig. We would go here again for the food, but expect poor service.",

The food line, the counter stools, the friendly wait staff all made the experience special. My wife and I stuck with the usual breakfast fare.  French toast, eggs and bacon, hash browns, toast and coffee. Everything fresh and familiar. Living close to Baltimore it is a pity they could not save some of the old close-in shopping areas to create a draw such as the Strip.",

I ordered the California Omelette and it was something I could make at home with better flavor.  The chicken in the omelette had no taste and it was overlooked.  Overall, I don't get the hype.

Deluca's is a mighty Pittsburgh tradition.  I get that.  I can see that this place is definitely a Yinzer kind of place.  Service was really great.  I mean it.  I mean, here you are trying to shovel food to starving patrons with achy feet after their long wait.  Think about that, it can't be pleasant.  The menu covers a lot of territory.  But I already knew I was going to be having a Western Omelet.  BJ followed a coworker friends bad advice and got the corned beef hash.  We were expecting the real thing, but I am sure this stuff came straight from a can.  Although it was grilled up really nice.  The home fries were really good.  The wheat toast was the best.  The ham in my omelet was very good.  All in all an interesting experience.  Another surprise, I had to take another shower that day in an attempt to remove the smell of grease from my body.  It's something I will not soon forget.  Did I say that I am a fan?  You can't mess with tradition.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had been looking forward to eating at DeLuca's for months, but every time we passed on a Saturday morning, we figured it was not worth the wait. We were right!  Luckily, we both had a Thursday off, and we're able to visit during a slow day. This might have actually been the biggest mistake we could've made.   DeLuca's obviously does not staff their Allstar waitresses on weekdays, and because of that, we paid the price. Upon walking in, we were promptly seated, but it then took over 5 minutes for our waitress to take our orders. My boyfriend ordered the mixed grill with bacon and sourdough toast, and I ordered the huevos rancheros.  It took an exorbitantly long time for our food to reach our table, and when it did, we were brought the wrong meal (as were two other groups sitting in our area).   When we finally got our meals, they were... Not good. The salsa on the huevos was so sweet that it tasted like barbecue sauce, and the refried beans on the side were like glue in my mouth. My boyfriend said the mixed grill was okay, but our waitress brought him white toast instead of sourdough, even though he asked her TWICE for sourdough (when we got the check, we saw that she wrote \"white toast\" on it).  If the food were decent, it might have made up for the poor service, but alas, that wasn't the case. Only a masochist would wait in line for DeLuca's. Go to Pamela's instead.",

That said, the food doesn't generally blow me out of the water.  It's definitely good, but I have to say that I prefer the Dor-Stop in Dormont for breakfast.  We went over the weekend.  Our service was great, as usual, everyone is very friendly.  I got corned beef hash (something the Dor-Stop is lacking), and it was alright.  It's hard to find really amazing corned beef hash - if you're ever in the Cleveland area and that's your thing, check out Big Al's.  Best I've ever had.  My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, which is his go-to most places.  He said it was good, but definitely preferred it elsewhere.  Overall, I think we would probably be a lot more excited about this place if we didn't have a place we liked better right near us.",

We were seated under the air conditioner so were freezing the entire time we were there. I don't mind a kind of grungy diner, but this place seems sticky and gross.  Our server was very pleasant, and the woman she was training was helpful and kept up with coffee re-fills.  In all honesty, I don't know why people line-up to get breakfast from this joint. Nothing spectacular on the menu in m y opinion....   Second story (from my husband so I know its True).... he went there door-busting Sunday morning, after a long night out. Although they were the first people waiting at the door, and were there about 20 minutes before they opened, another group of people strolled up in front of them right at opening and were seated first. These people were then served first, and it took almost 45 minutes for my husband and his group of friends to get their food. They are guessing the group that cavalierly cut in front of them was a group of regulars. One of the people in my husbands group complained to management and they were given a gift certificate, but it almost made one of the group members late miss their flight out of town....   So glad we went during the week when it wasn't that crowded.",

Each visit we waited in line outside of Deluca's for a table. It was raining, but the line moved quickly and we were under cover anyways. The service is prompt and friendly.   It's definitely a great place to recommend to out of towners for a good local breakfast stop. The bread is all Mancini's...delicious. Local flavor, great location. Will return.",

Food: Lot of carbs that fill you up quickly - toast, pancake, hash, eggs. Bacon was crispy but flavorful and definitely enjoyed that. Love the chocolate chip pancake where they add them into the pancake instead of just pouring some chips on top after the pancake is done. Toast was bland - if deciding what to skip in carbs, this would be it. Hash and eggs were basic cooked items without much flavor so add your own condiments to make it work.  Service: Ok, don't come here for service cuz you'll hate yourself. Similar to other popular breakfast places I've visited, you only see servers for beverage order, food order, food delivery, check.  FYI: Cash Only! Get here before 10am on weekends to limit wait times cuz there will definitely be a line. I got here at 9am and there was about 5 min wait.",

    "text": "If you're looking for diner food, this is a good bet! I'm wavering between three and four stars, but rounding up for charm.  We were deciding between Pamela's and Deluca's. Deluca's advertised a shorter wait time, so we jumped in line anxious for some breakfast! It was Saturday morning and took about 45 minutes until we got seated. I don't mind waiting for food, but I'm not sure I would wait that long next time.   The menu is extensive and covers your diner staples from omelettes and eggs benedict, to pancakes and crepes. Everyone at my table ordered something different. I went with the corned beef hash which was served with toast, eggs and home fries. We also got an order of the special pumpkin pancakes to share. The portions were HUGE. We all ate about half of what we got and were stuffed to the brim. The pancakes were better than I imagined they would be and I'd definitely recommend going the sweet and savory route.   Service was pretty good and efficient. Our waitress spilt a full cup of coffee on the table, but they were quick to react and clean it up. While waiting for our food, we enjoyed looking at all the photos and memorabilia on the wall from local athletes to celebs (and Man vs. Food)!   Like I said, it was some solid food and we were full for hours. Worth the wait? I'll let you decide that for yourself.",

The man inside had said the wait would be about 15 minutes which was pretty much BS but I am glad to say it was worth it! Service was quick but not personal (those servers had zero time to chitchat, all running around like chickens with their heads cut off). The coffee was great and refilled regularly, and my boyfriend and I split the Californian omelette and chocolate chip pancakes. We ate it all and loved it! It was all perfectly portioned and we left feeling full but not disgusting. The pancakes were really special, and for those who love to over-indulge, their menu has a ton of ridiculous pancake options. Loved the vintage diner vibe but did not get the movie reference throughout.  WOAAAH I almost forgot to mention the best part! The omelette came with probably the most AMAZING sauce in the world. My boyfriend really proved his worth when he asked if we could have more on the side, and were given an entire freaking bowl of this dream sauce. Amazing stuff, it really was all in the sauce.",

    "text": "I love Deluca's, they are proud of their traditional breakfast and the do it well. The ingredients are always fresh, the service is excellent and the menu gives you lots of options.  Here are some things you should know:  The Strip District location is cash only, but there is a newer Robinson location that takes credit cards. There are several ATM's close by ion the Strip in case you forget.  You can make reservations 24 hours in advance for parties of 6 or more. It's a great idea, especially given the lines that often go outside the door.  Deluca's is not for everybody, it's classic diner with a great reputation and they are reluctant to change. But the food is good and it's a perennial favorite and a source of pride for many Pittsburghers.  There is a hustle and bustle to Deluca's.  It's people on their way to a game, or on their way to shop in the Strip. There's a kind of excitement here which you may not find relaxing, but it's part of Pittsburgh tradition and worth experiencing.  There some unusual ethnic dishes which are quite good, for example, a Greek omelet with Feta cheese and Spinach. Pierogies.   I like their traditional breakfast, especially because their potatoes are always served perfect. The buckwheat pancakes are something unique as well.  Deluca's is a must for anyone who wants to fully experience Pittsburgh.",

Our waitress was wonderful and helped us narrow down that big diner menu. I would recommend the pancakes over the waffle and the breakfast potatoes are pretty much just a mushed up baked potato, so you might want to pass on those for some of the other delicious items. They had 3 types of sausage to choose from and waffle, pancakes or French toast were an option for every combo. Don't let the line outside deter you, it moves really fast.",

Our waitress greeted us as we came in the door and we had coffee in front of us within second of our butts hitting our seats!  Omelettes were made with freshly cracked eggs and were huge!  I had the Western and the hubby had a Greek with chicken.  Both were very good as were the home fries.  They have several different egg benedict choices that all looked great as did a huge pancake special that the person sitting next to us had.  Makes me want to drive down from Youngstown on Saturday for breakfast!  The hour drive each way would be well worth it!",

By 10:00 am, there was a line out the door and that is pretty typical for this place.  DeLuca's walls are covered in Pittsburgh history, making wait for your breakfast not so bad! The diner is also a lot bigger than expected, it goes back pretty far. Do not expect servers that want to chat with you- this is a BUSY breakfast spot! Never the less, the service has always been great when I have visited.   My boyfriend and I love this place and have been here so many times, but my parents have never been until I brought them here last month! They were SO impressed by the huge portions they received and loved everything. My dad had the Steel City Breakfast Of Champs, which consisted of a Short stack of pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 pcs of bacon, sausage, homefries & toast (mancini's toast to be exact). He loved everything and was really impressed with the pancakes! They were perfectly fluffy and just delicious. I had the hotcake special and loved every minute of it. They made my egg whites perfectly and the bacon was super good! My mom had an omelette and loved it as well! I've also had their specialty pumpkin pancakes and they are insanely good as well!  If you have never been to DeLuca's, you need to right now. Genuine Pittsburgh breakfast and you will leave full and VERY happy!",

Don't get me wrong, the breakfast is tasty, the menu is extensive and the prices are reasonable but it just doesn't knock it out of the ballpark for me.  I always opt for the two eggs, meat, potatoes and toast breakfast, and I'm always ecstatic when a restaurant has a turkey sausage or turkey bacon option which they do.    Where I think they fall short is their breakfast potatoes.   They aren't crispy or flavorful enough.  Since this two egg meal choice is my breakfast staple, I can't help but compare it to the Kelly O's and Pamela's equivalent and it just doesn't compare.   My husband likes that they have more options on the menu here (country fried chicken and biscuits, biscuits and gravy, etc.). They also have a ton of breakfasts that seem more like desserts (think waffle sundae).   It's certainly a local Strip destination that should be investigated, it's just not my spot of choice.  Also, if you are looking for a trendy or upscale place, you should walk on by because this is a classic, greasy spoon diner.",

Cash only so check on that. I think you can judge a diner by how good their cornbeef hash is, and this one is really delicious.

These things are barely omelets but are plain delicious. Pancakes? They don't get much better than what Deluca's is serving.  OKAY we get it. The food is outstanding. I even might call it the best breakfast in burgh. Is it worth standing outside, waiting a half hour to get in? Yes. Would I do it in freezing rain?

My husband loved his Eggsceptional egg sandwich.  It was served on thick cut Italian toast and very delicious.  My spinach, tomato and feta omelet was good but a little overcooked.  Get there early to avoid a wait, but don't get discouraged if there is one.  The place is a lot bigger than it looks and they move people in and out quickly.  And remember -- Cash only.",

    "text": "My wife had been here before, but it was my first visit. We visited the Robinson location before and wanted to try the original. Surprisingly enough, we only had to wait about 10 minutes on a late Sunday morning around 11:30. They were still busy inside though, but that didn't affect our service. The waitress was attentive and nice to answer all our menu questions (we like to make substitutions).   We are big coffee drinkers, and once she noticed she couldn't keep up, she brought over a carafe.   As for the food, the menu is huge. My wife got poached eggs (surprise), and they were cooked perfectly. She also got her raisin toast well done. She had to send it back to have it run through again. When it came back out, it was perfect. The waitress didn't mind, and she even warned her it might come out too dark and didn't want her to be upset.   I ordered the Greek omelet with grilled chicken. It was pretty big, and had a lot of cheese in it. It tasted really good, my only minor change would be less grease. Something about a greasy omelet usually doesn't sit well with my stomach. But again, it was really good.   We both got fruit cups instead of potatoes. The fruit wasn't that ripe, and our waitress warned us about that too, but it still wasn't bad. And a better option than the home fries would have been, because I didn't have an hour to go to the bathroom.   DeLuca's is a Pittsburgh staple everyone has to try at least once.  It really is a perfect greasy diner experience if that's what you are looking for.",

My wife and 3 boys (11, 13 and 15) are breakfast junkies, seriously, we could ready breakfast 3 times a day 7 days a week. So we had to try Delucas while in Pittsburgh for a holiday. We saw it on Man Vs Food and DDD. It is a dive no doubt about it. But the food is awesome. We ate breakfast at around 930a and didn't eat again until 10p.....the portions are huge.

I've only been here once but I'm already sold.   My husband and I ordered a few random things on the rather large menu and everything was pretty darn good. He tried the Reuben Melt with Lobster Bisque soup and I got the Country Fried Chicken, Eggs and Biscuits. The Lobster Bisque was surprisingly creamy and full of flavor for a diner soup. I'll admit, the Country Fried Chicken was a bit heavy for brunch but it was so amazing; every bite was worth the gazillion calories that I consumed. The chicken was well seasoned and moist, the batter was crispy and the creamy gravy made it all the more comforting. I could tell the biscuits were homemade or made very well bc they were so moist and great alongside everything else.   If I could, I would come here every weekend but the line and wait can be discouraging (and I would gain so much weight). Awesome location, delicious diner food, but always crowded. Come prepared to wait.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in while we were in Pittsburgh for the Steelers/Browns game over NYE weekend. OMG is all I have to say. Probably the best breakfast I've ever eaten. It was rather busy, but we only waited a couple of minutes to be seated. Our waitress was practically at our table waiting to take our drink order when we were seated. She took our order and had our fiod back out to us within 10-15 minutes tops. We ended up ordering way too much food, but goodness was it amazing!  Our order: -Philly Cheesesteak Omelet: Perfect. The eggs, meat, and veggies were perfectly cooked and seasoned. -Sausage gravy and homemade biscuit: Probably the best I've ever eaten. I can't even begin to describe the buttery biscuit and thick, creamy gravy. -Home fries, Corned beef hash, and eggs overeasy: The eggs were thoroughly cooked, the home fries were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, and the corned beef hash was perfect. It was fried perfectly, not soggy or too crunchy, just right. -Dolce da Choccolato: Words cannot describe or do it justice. It's a crepe filled with Nutella and strawberries topped with whipped cream and dusted with powdered sugar. I love crepes and ordered it thinking it would be like any other crepe. I was WRONG! This sucker was at least 12\" long, yes seriously a foot long. I have never seen strawberries that big before. It took both of us to eat it and we barely we able to finish it.  The term \"Best breakfast in town\" is a lie. It needs to be changed to \"Best breakfast on the planet!\"",

Sleezy diners with delicious breakfast & lunch have a special place in my heart.  DeLucas nailed it for me.  From omelettes to sandwiches & salads, the food was always consistently good.    After a 7 year hiatus, I visited P'burgh last weekend and had to hit up DeLuca's.  Seemed like something had slipped during that time period.  It took 15 minutes for the servers to decide which one of them was going to be assigned to us.  Not a good beginning.  No one even  offered coffee or a beverage to start.    My omelette was dry and overcooked.  Veggie and meat filling wasn't warm, cheese not melted.  Soggy hash browns and barely toasted bread only added insult to injury.  Bear in mind, I'm not expecting an uber-brunch here.....its a diner, OK?   Maybe an off day, maybe not. I were  Adam Richman, Anthony Bourdain or Guy Fieri , my sorry excuse for an omelette with cold filling would have never hit the table!   (Just sayin')  Next time I'm in town, I might brave the lines at  P&G's Pamela's Diner.",

Maybe it was the best breakfast in 1950, not too sure about it in 2017.  There are certainly strong competitors nearby.  You cannot beat its location.  It's the middle of Strip District, and everyone comes to Strip District on the weekend.    Coffee and breakfast were ok.  Nothing really stand-out.  I tried it once, and not going to wait another hour for it.  If you are here on a weekday / no line somehow, give it a try.  I bet 90% of that line is visitors from out-of-town.",

Honestly they make you feel like you've known them for years! Aside from the warm atmosphere, the food is great! It's about as diner-y as a diner can get and I love it! This time I ordered the \"superbowl,\" which is an omelette stuffed with mashed potatoes, onions, kielbasa, and cheese, with a side of sauerkraut. It sounds hideous but was absolutely amazing, certainly one of my new favorites. The quantity of food they serve you gives you a bang for your buck. Honestly if I don't leave with a box in hand I've probably engorged myself! With that in mind, I couldn't help but order the freshly baked Mancini's toast anyway because.. why not!  Honestly I will continue to come here as long as it stays open, and I hope it never closes. Pittsburgh wouldn't be Pittsburgh without Delucas.",

    "text": "Well, I finally caved.  After years of resisting that persistent, daunting line that has become a rite of Pittsburgh passage, I finally braved the wait and went to Deluca's.  Perhaps it was due to good company (or the first signs of sun this spring), but the 30+ minute wait that we endured seemed to go relatively quick.  After finally making it to the doorway, we were asked to come in by the hostess, only to be left inside the doorway with no real inclination of whether we should proceed to one of the several open tables or wait.  When we finally tracked down the hostess again, she said we needed us to wait to sit down as to, \"not upset the chef.\"  Fast forward, and we've finally sat down (in the seat Tom Cruise filmed Jack Reacher nonetheless).  After attempting the scan the entirely too complex menu (do you really need multiple versions of what is essentially the same dish?), we settled on the breakfast burrito, the seafood benedict, the seafood omelette (same as the seafood benedict, just with the bread on the side instead of under) and the apple pancake sundae (figured go big or go home).  Within about fifteen minutes, the burrito, benedict and omelette were brought out.   By this point, out entire party was starving and I told everyone to go ahead and get started (the server said my pancakes would be another minute).  Overall, each were about the most stereo-typically bland diner food you could ever get.  But, fast forward twenty minutes...  still no pancakes (and everyone else has finished).  Once the server finally made it back around, she mentioned something in passing about the apples on the pancake and left again (we had no idea what she said).  After another five minutes or so, my pancakes finally came out, and by this point, ready to leave, I succumbed to hunger and dove in.  Bland... bland... bland... and an associated stomach ache from the pure sugar rush.  After chewing through about half the plate, I gave up on it (I almost never leave food on the plate).  Ready to go, we asked for the check, with the one saving grace that redeemed Deluca's from one star being the server proactively taking the pancakes off of our tab.  Check this off the list as a one and done.",

We were seated in the back booth, in front of people cooking and everything so it was fun to see all that (albeit a little hard to talk to the 3 people seated next to me).

The couple seated after us were half done with their meal when we asked what happened to our order, and not even a \"thanks for waiting\" or \"sorry to keep you waiting\" look? And no bag to put the box in for left overs when another table gets one? Not a kind of service I would go back for.  Giving two stars simply for the one good omelette.

The black tea and lemon he had was good, though it was probably because I never had tried them together before. His toast was good, but he wasn't so happy with the food overall.  Not because they're bad, but you expect getting better food than what you can cook at home. I was happy with my omelette and their home fries. The chorizo really spiced it up. I don't like the salsa or ketchup on it though.   The service was quick once we were seated. It took a while to get our food. Would I come back again? Yes if I don't need to wait.",

It's no surprise that one can wait up to an hour in a line snaking down the block for a table on Saturday or Sunday morning.  While my friend Chris and Callen were waiting in line for Pens tickets, I decided to hit up the Strip District and check out this breakfast institution. It's been featured on the Travel and Food networks, and I knew I was in store for something special. There was a huge line of people waiting in freezing weather. Since I was alone, I decided to try and skip the huge line and nab a seat at the bar, which was a stellar idea.  The service here was great. Although everyone working here was buzzing around at incredible speeds, they still regularly checked in on me. After I ordered my food, it came out quickly and I had my refills of coffee. The atmosphere here is my favorite part. A long, counter bar runs the length of the establishment. Behind it are cooks hard at work on equipment that must be at least fifty years old. It it's not broken, don't fix it! I was also in the back, in full veiw of a wipeboard that helps employees keep track of everything. They needed to order five box of coffee and also didn't want employees to forget the holiday bowling party.  Simply put: this place is fun.  The coffee is whatever, not bad, not great. For the food, I knew as soon as my eyes set on it: MOAB, or mother of all burritos. This was a huge soft tortilla filled with chorizo, scrambled eggs, hot banana peppers, tomatoes, onions, avocado and homefries. It's topped with salsa, cheddar and sour cream. Overall, delicious. There's a lot of flavors going on, but I really enjoyed this, and it was certainly filling enough to keep me going until dinner. Deluca's doesn't use the best ingredients, and it wasn't the most delicious breakfast, but I really enjoyed my visit. I'd go again.  Bottom Line: Enjoy the show by sitting at the bar. Marvel at the staff, and soak up the atmosphere. The food's not bad either. Cash only.",

I've been all over the world and eaten at some spectacular place and I can say that Deluca's ranks right up there with then. The service is a 10/10 with the staff that is fast, nice and very thorough. The food is fantastic diner food. I asked the waitress which omelette is the most ordered and the best tasting and without hesitation, she said the 'Deluca Omelette' which is a 4-egg omelette with all the fixin's inside it. WOW!! It was simply unbelievable. The coffee is awesome too!  From now on, this will be a staple for a family visit when we are in Pittsburgh next. Can not wait!",

The staff was super friendly and fast.  My son had a breakfast burritto with Chicken and it was HUGE and a growing 14 year olds dream breakfast.  This past week end I visited with my daughter as part of our visit to Univeristy of Pitt.  She loved it too.  She had the apple crepe's and gave it a big thumbs up.  I ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes (seasonal offering)  with eggs and sausage and was so very happy.    The service is amazing.  They are fast!  It's great to sit at the counter and watch the cooks.  Cracked eggs litter the floor.  The atmosphere is fun and has a great local flair.  Worth your time to walk the neighborhood and shop for meats, pasta, seasonings etc.  I will be back next time I am in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "No two ways about it, this is a classic old style diner.  It has been in existance since 1951.  I went on a Fri morning and they were crowded but I was able to get a seat at the counter.  I was told that it would have been much busier on a sat or sun.  There was some disagreement between two waitresses as who would take my order.  A few sharp words were spoken between them.  First thing, the menu is a novel.  It takes too long to read it.  Places that concentrate on making a few items generally do a better job at it.    I didn't have to wait too long for my breakfast.  I ordered eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash browns.  The eggs were cooked perfectly but the sauce was not a hollandaise and had no lemon flavor at all.  That detracted from the flavor.    One thing to know ahead of time is that they only take cash.  No credit cards.  Apparently this is somewhat common in the Strip from what I was told.",

I know it's expensive to give out, but I'd gladly pay for it. Weak coffee / iced coffee. It's pretty terrible, actually. Also, their only sugar sub. is knockoff sweet n low. Our waitress was great and offered me acouple of Splenda from her own stash. It's a small thing.  Notes: Milkshake was thin but tasty and service was fast. I'd come back here if i were in the city!",

I finally got around to trying this Pittsburgh landmark in the Strip District, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.  The pancakes were delicious (thick and rich), and everything else was acceptable or better--not to mention plentiful (with my meal I received a mountain of home fries, eggs, bacon, sausage and toast...not bad, especially given the prices).  The one strike against this place (aside from the waits if you come at peak times) was that the waiter acknowledged but then ignored all requests for drink refills, leaving me thirsty for more water and my companion rationing the smallest $2 cup of diner coffee anyone ever received.  If I find this issue persistent over multiple visits (and I'll certainly be back), that will probably cost them a star, but for now I'll overlook one server having one bad day and give this place a reasonably enthusiastic endorsement.  Deluca's is too good a value to not try again.",

    "text": "I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this place. We read all the raving reviews, watched the appearance of this place on Man vs. Food, and were pumped to go. Maybe our expectations were too high. We waited in line for 45 minutes and our waitress was less than welcoming. She finally came to get our drink order after almost 10 minutes of us being there. We were chatting and the menu is huge, so we didn't know what we wanted to order yet...if looks could kill!!! Our waitress was obviously not happy about that. Once we finally ordered, it took a good 30 minutes for our food and this is how it went: Waitress comes to table, drops off my fiance's food and doesn't say a single word. I sit there with no food, wondering where mine is with no waitress in sight. After 5 minutes, I tell my fiance I appreciate his kindness, but his food is getting cold, so he digs in. 5 more minutes, the waitress finally comes and drops my food off along with the check, never asking if we had everything or needed anything else. We eat our typical diner food (huge portions, though), pay our bill, and never looked back.   My theory is that the line is so long because it really does take forever just to get any sort of basic service here.  I was also horrified to read the food inspection report, especially seeing that they failed like 3 times before they actually passed. The sad part is, after being there, I wasn't really surprised at all. So if anyone has any good recommendations for Pittsburgh's actual best breakfast at a place with better service that is clean, I would really appreciate that! This just wasn't it for me, but to each their own.",

I see lines of people waiting outside of Deluca's and I wonder how many of these are returning customers or people just inspired by the novelty.  This is not to say its bad, but it IS overrated.  My better half and I both arrived with starving appetites, and the portions were very generous. I give them kudos for prompt service in the malestrom of customers. The menu options are diverse and unique. Perhaps if I try more I could revamp my opinion.  I ordered a concoction of fried chicken, gravy, home fries and scrambled eggs. It was greasy and tasty, but maybe my expectations were too high? Perhaps I have also been spoiled by similar food elsewhere in Pittsburgh that remains off the beaten path and for half the price. Thanks Delucas, it was fun, but its me...not you. We can still be friends right?",

This is an arggh meat and potatoes and off to work the railroad or steel mill type joint.   I do not love their home fries or has browns, whichever they are kind of flavorless, I also did not love their huevos rancheros idea ~ why put it on the menu if it doesn't have the right beans or any beans? There are other menu options which are ok but not much diversity on the menu. Seating is tight and tiny it gets very sweaty in the summer.
