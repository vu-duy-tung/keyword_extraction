I've never eaten in (I like wine with dinner and this joint is halal, so booze is a no-no), but the take out is oh-so-tasty.  If grape leaves are your thing, get them here! They're moist and a tiny bit tangy.  Also, the Iraqi kebab is had at least once a week in my house- I have no idea how the meat is seasoned, but it's perfection.  The rice is generally better than the fries, if you can't decide between the two.  Hidden gem.",

We had to spend $50 in order to use it. We did, the bill came, and the owner tells us he is not signed up for this deal and doesn't accept the coupon. He said that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> signed him up AUTOMATICALLY, and he has no clue how to remove his listing from there. He said that he tried calling them and he spoke to his \"lawyer\". This man is a liar. He wants the money from the coupon AND what we spent in the restaurant. He is manipulative and deceitful. To top it off, the service was terrible. It was only him and then this young man who came in for his shift a bit later. It took 15 minutes to get waters. The one appetizer took about 20 minutes. No one checked on us to see if the food was good. There was no music either and we were alone in the resturant, this made the atmosphere eerie.

Next, only 3 of the ~10 entrees were available for ordering that night despite the restaurant being nearly vacant showing some supply logistics still need to be improved. Lastly, the service is nearly inexistent. When we walked in, there was no host or employee to seat us. Once seated after several minutes of waiting, the person taking care of us was prompt to take our orders and serve the food but never returned to refill our drinks.  I think all of these problems are remediable and look forward to seeing a more mature Dijlah.  Now the food is certainly a bright spot. For appetizer, we split the Sigara Borek and Hummus. The borek is a fried thin dough pastry frilled with feta cheese or potatoes. I highly recommend the potato filled ones. The hummus had way to much tahini. If I wasn't one if those weirdos who like halva, then it would have been very unpleasant to eat the hummus. Our main courses were Chicken Shawarma and Iraqi Kebab. The chicken was lean but too dry for my liking. The kebab was fatty, greasy, and very well seasoned. It tasted like it was broiled rather than grilled. Regardless, I really liked the flavor and softness of the meat. I think the Iraqi kebab would be perfect as the meat of a burger.  All in all, Dijlah is a place I'd return to once it has a bit more experience.",

The only reason I did not give this place 5 starts was because they did not have the tea and dessert that I wanted and that were listed on the menu, and also because I was given the check without being asked if I wanted dessert or anything else. These points are not really major, but I do feel it is customary, and good practice, to ask the patron if he or she wants anything else. All in all, food that is tasty, filling, authentic and satisfying coupled with good friendly service has earned a solid 4 star rating",

The food was ready in about 15 minutes and everything was great!   We are mostly veggie eaters so we each tried the falafel wrap, which was excellent. The falafel was crispy and warm, grilled with veggies in a pita wrap. The wraps came with a fresh cucumber sauce that we put on the wraps, a great addition. We tried the tabouli, which was also fresh and delicious. We also shared a spinach + feta pie from the appetizer section.   This was a LOT of fresh food for a great price, we will definitely be going back. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I really want to give this place 5 stars.  I've been here thrice (mildly amused that I got to legitimately use this word).  All three times the food was great. Perfectly cooked meats (dryer than an average meat dish.  But this is how it's supposed to be made.  Lamb with a dash of cinnamon flavoring.  Delicious yogurt based dips for wraps.   Two times the service was good.  The first time we went however, was probably the worst service I've experienced since the late Del's restaurant (which may is definitely in the top 5 of worst Italian-related things, up there with Benito Mussolini).  There were three gentlemen working, and as many tables occupied.  I've never been so poorly treated by a wait staff.  We had a large group of 8, and had made reservations.  They took a long time to get our waters.  And then we waited longer to have someone take our order.  Then we waited longer still to get our food (I understand there is a wait time between ordering and receiving, but this felt extra long).  We enjoyed our meal and were ready to leave.  No one acknowledged us.  We sat there and did all the passive-aggressive symbols (make direct eye contact with your waiter, put your napkins on your plate, cough) until my wife eventually just asked our server.  He looked up from the table (it was his friends, whom weren't eating) and gestured with a single finger, as if to say 'one minute' and went back to speaking to his friends.  We waited for 5-10 more minutes and received our check.  The fact that the food was so good made me go back.  But I ordered takeout the next time.  Last time I was there was for lunch, when the restaurant was empty and the service was great (a younger girl who was extremely nice was our server).  Like I said, I normally hate when someone craps all over a restaurant due to a relatively minor anecdotal-evidence based event, but this became the standard bearer of bad service.  But, they've improved significantly since, so I can't ding them too hard.  (Once again, this food is great).  Go check it out, but avoid it if it's all the dudes working there, as they seemed more intent on hanging out than running a restaurant.  If there's a gal there, go in and enjoy great service.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Michael Jackson.  Obviously capable of greatness, but also capable of awful things (allegedly).",

I'm sure the colorful pillowed benches along the walls have something to do with it, in addition to the hanging cloths on the ceiling (look up!). Far in the back, there seemed to be a karaoke area that is popular late at nights, though I didn't step foot in there. Judging by the number of people who were just around to eat or kick it around midnight on a Friday, it was obvious that this place was legit.   In terms of food, the portions are huge and everything is grilled perfectly. The pita is a tad crispy and the yellow rice actually had a nice savory taste to it. All the meats were tasty, but favorite was definitely the Iraqi kebab. Lots of spices and flavor,  all coming in three large skewers of meat. I was also a fan of the chicken and beef in the Dijlah sampler meal.  Lastly they have a nice list of different teas. Didn't order any this time, though we did get to try the Ahmed tea that came with a check-in. Very good, and just might get a full cup next time.",

It's decent food, but nothing to write home about. I prefer some spice and flavor with my food, and even though other people really love Dijlah, I find the food to be too bland, typically. If you put salt on the rice dishes, it works wonders, but there's not much flavor in most of the lamb, goat, and beef dishes. I'm also biased towards Indian food, which usually is packed with spices (not necessarily spicy, though...just ginger, garlic, turmeric, mustard seeds, etc...). To be honest, it's not that different from a lot of American restaurants in that it's easy food for your stomach, albeit a little bit oily.   It's halal, which helps! There's a hookah bar in the back and I've seen it reserved for parties and concerts. Overall, not a bad place, but I wouldn't go here unless my friends take me here. Still not quite a 2, because service is fairly good, but nothing out of the ordinary.",

I am from middle eastern decent and I have not been able to find something that even resembles authentic food until I found this place. Yummy! I had the Iraqi kebab, and the rest of my party had the shawarma wrap with fries and the mixed grill plate. We shared the hummus as an appetizer and it was so very tasty.   The bad part? Service. Our server was terrible. I know what it's like to work as a server and therefore I am very willing to look past some things, but the list of things got too long. First, getting greeted after waiting g for ten minutes (while seeing her on her phone in the kitchen area), being led to a dirty table (she gave it a quick wile while we were standing there), being served cups with lipstick stains on it (then having to wait another ten minutes for another cup), talking to us as if we're the biggest inconvenience in the world, waiting a very long time for the hummus appetizer, then for the food, then she had forgotten to ring in the wrap and instead of coming over to apologise she sent her co worker with the food she remembered, them came over with the wrap ten minutes later, THEN the fries that were supposed to come with ut ten minutes after that. On top of it all, it was an inconvenience to her (and she made sure we knew it) that we needed to split the one order off and pay it separately. No drink refills. No taste check. No pre bussing. No gratitude.   If the service was even half as good as the food it would get five stars but I cannot look past such poor treatment of restaurant guests.",

We phoned in our order (GrubHub is also available) and the girl taking our order was polite and made sure she had our order right. We were happy to hear that our sandwiches could be part of a lunch special that included a side salad, so we didn't have to order extra salads to share, as we had planned on.  I went with the Iraqi kebab sandwich. It was absolutely  delicious, a perfectly cooked blend of beef and lamb in a wheat pita. Also inside were pickled onions (one of my favorite things on earth), tomatoes, parsley, and sumac. Herb, onion, and lamb flavors blended together perfectly, and the overall taste was hearty, but still fresh and bright. The wrap was also perfectly constructed: it didn't fall apart at all, and there was no annoying leakage. The accompanying side salad was larger than expected, with red cabbage, tomato, and parsley atop lettuce in a vinegar-based dressing. I love a mainly vinegar dressing, and the proportions of lettuce to topping to dressing were just right.  My co-workers ordered the vegetarian sampler, the chicken shawarma sandwich, and the falafel sandwich. They all were equally pleased with their lunches, with the hummus getting a special shout-out. We are looking forward to enjoying more great lunches from Dijlah!",

    "text": "Following the departure of Istanbul from Lawrenceville, another Middle-Eastern restaurant has taken its place, and has done so admirably as evidenced by a pre-gig meal here recently. Frustrated by their hours and days of operation as I was by its predecessor, I did my homework and persisted until I was reimbursed handsomely with a lush Arabic meal after being greeted by locked doors and darkened windows on several occasions.  An adorable cherub of an infant watched this bruising, black-clad, bald-headed heavy metal warrior/bon viviant intently as he noshed on Sigara Borek, mercilessly masticated some Shawarma, and regaled in a honeyed, flaky brick of Baklava underneath billowy ceiling curtains on a comfortable, vibrant couch.   The Sigara Borek consisted of a quaternion of deep-fried scrolls filled with feta, potato, and parsely. Within the brittle, ochroid pastry shell, the brackish feta and the starch would attempt to overthrow each other while the humble parsley balanced them out, acting as a Libra to a Leo and a Taurus in divorce court.   A \"Meat Shawarma\" sandwich made up my main course (shawarma can also be had as a platter). Swaddled in pita bread which in turn was wrapped in bakery tissue, the gyro of sorts was stuffed with shaved cuts of steeped beef tenderloin and complimented by onions, tomatoes, parsley, and sweet/sour pickles (!) with a tahini sauce I swore was tzatziki due to its creaminess served on the side. The meat, whatever concoction it was marinated in, was uncompromisingly ambrosial, and the sandwich itself was brilliantly layered. The toasted, the savory, the tangy, the buttery, and the mildly bitter presented themselves in pageantic fashion with every juicy chomp.   The baklava was as chewy, nutty, and sticky as a Snicker bar with an edible, paper casing, making it a primer on this kind of pastry. If only the helping had been a bit larger...  A green waitress made a valiant effort to provide good service, succeeding despite her inexperience with this manner of cuisine; no definite, deal-dropping snags were encountered as I was seated and served promptly.   With a reasonable and exotic bill of fare combined with lavish yet cozy surroundings, I see no genuine reason why Dijlah won't be yet another Lawrenceville smash. That is, if the people of LoLa give Dijlah a chance to charm them, and they most certainly should and will.   P.S. I peeked behind a curtain in the back while I was waiting for someone to vacate the men's restroom and noticed not only a hookah bar but a dancefloor (!) as well. It looks like another nighttime hotspot is in the making.",

Iraqi cusine has some similarities to Persian which other Arab cuisines lack. Overall if your in the mood for pretty decent Iraqi cusine its up there. They occasionally have more pan-Khaleeji dishes as well such as Kabsa. Highly recommend. Decent rice by Iraqi and Persian standards. Hummos is very good as is the bread (nan/khoobz). I usually get a Vimto on the side. Just wish theyd start having KalehPache available 1x per week for breakfasts...",

    "text": "Come hungry!  And patient. My group of 5 dined at Dijlah for the first time for a birthday dinner this past Saturday.  I REALLY can't say enough about the food. We started with hummus and a falafel appetizer. The hummus was delicious and the falafel was enough for an entire meal, easy. At $4.99 I was convinced the wrong item had been delivered.  To give you an idea of Dijlah's oversized portions - when my meal arrived I immediately asked for a box. I can throw down a lot of food, but this monstrosity was too enormous to even entertain the notion of finishing.  Still, I highly recommend the Mixed Grill - a selection of lamb, beef and chicken kabobs, with the best damn rice I've ever had and a simple salad with not-so-simple and amazing dressing. Incredible. All of it. My dinner companions enjoyed a variety of falafel wraps, Iraqi kabobs and grape leaves, and none were disappointed. Note: Dijlah doesn't serve alcohol or offer byob, so fill up prior and you'll be fine ;-)  Here's where it gets tricky.  The service was almost non-existent. Our server was a very pleasant young man who did not seem to have it together. It took a solid 20+ minutes for our drinks, then our food came out very sporadically, with each person starting their meal many minutes apart.  When it came time for the check, he really struggled. To be honest, I have no idea what the problem was, but - there's no nice way to say it - this guy might want to reconsider this line of work. The restaurant wasn't busy and we did get out in under 2 hours, but for 5 people it could've been a more customer-friendly experience all around. Kudos to the manager (or owner?) who jumped in to help serve dessert and refill drinks. He was a delight.   My advice? Don't pass up this gem, but go for take-out instead.",

    "text": "We were trying to find a local spot with hookah and food, at the same time. It was hard to find in Pittsburgh it was either hookah or food well not even food you had tea or something like that. So when we found it we were happy. However you couldnt have hookah and food until after 930. The reason? I believe because it was Ramadan. So there is a dining area and a back portion with a projector and a hookah area. The seating is traditional floor or low seating in the back portion.  So we get here a little after 9 and we still have to wait until 930 for hookah, which is fine. We order some food to hold us over. We ordered the Iraqi kabob, french fries, a mint lemonade and a mango strawberry smoothie. The food was ok, not the best ive had. Oh yea most of the food comes with rice but in the back room where the hookah is there is no rice allowed. im guessing it because of rice and the carpet? The food was about a B- which isnt bad. I ordered grilled onions for an extra dollar and I got a half of onion, yes an entire half that had been on the grill long enough to get grill marks but not to be cooked.   We ordered a hookah in a pineapple they were out so we opted for a orange. There was one guy making all of the hookahs so it took a while for it to be made and brought out to us. Once it came it was good no complaints. The prices for the food and hookah were on point. Its lower then what we would pay in Milwaukee.   Of the hookah spots in Pittsburgh this is the one that i would choose to go to if ever in town again.",

I love that they have real bread, not that BS Americanized style of pita bread. We also had the babaganoush and hummus.

Both of them were so delicious, although I think the kofte was my favorite!   No bar and no BYOB here, but there is a hookah lounge in the back.

The lamb was incredibly tender and had the perfect amount of fat. The generous amount of rice that came with it was fantastically seasoned. We thought the portion of meat was going to be larger, but the quality more than made up for it. The Iraqi kebab was also a great choice and was prepared perfectly. I really wanted the fries because I'm in love with fries and they looked good from the photos on Yelp. They did not disappoint.   It was a spacious dining area with seats and colorful decor along the walls. There was something quite charming about the atmosphere. From the patterned pillows to the very visible ceiling plugs, we felt like we were eating in a friend's living room. (Even the bathroom felt very home-like.)  Boyfriend said this is the best food he's had in Pittsburgh. It was the best meal I've had since coming back after three months in NYC. Dijlah has replaced our go-to Middle Eastern restaurant.

I had the falafel dinner which was very freshly and perfectly cooked.  Everyone's meal looked mouthwatering!",

    "text": "Another late lunch with a friend.  We had no wait.  There is parking in the rear of the building on weekends but street parking on weekdays.  Comfortable atmosphere and seating.  Service was friendly, restaurant and bathrooms clean. We ordered the Dijlah Combination platter for 5.  OK, I know I said a friend and I and YES I know that is TWO but, we wanted leftovers.  I did not think that it would be as much food at it was.  Dijlah Plate is a mix of Iraqi meat & chicken Kabobs, Lamb & chicken Tikka, Kufta, Falafil, Chicken & Meat Shawarama, and Fries served with rice and salad.  Oh wait, we also ordered a side of Kubeh and a combo appetizer.  (I said we wanted leftovers) If you like the Middle Eastern flavors this place does them right.  The meats were tender, the falafil fluffy, the kabobs with a bit of char, a huge fresh salad, warm pitas and delicious dipping sauces.   You get a real decent amount of delicious food for the price...... and probably leftovers.",

I came here hoping to eat and smoke and do work which is asking alot of sheesha spot, however it exceeded expectations on all fronts. There's a back room with chill music and outlets to do work. I had a Iraqi chicken wrap which was bomb, a starbuzz hookah, tea, and diet coke and I paid 22 dollars ?!! Service was amazing and the bowl was packed with respect lol. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Honestly this place is always so I go to for a late night eats and quick bites. The service has always been top notch and the atmosphere is beautiful. The tables have one side against the wall and the other with just normal chairs. The seats against the wall ordained with pillows and beautiful fabric. There are hanging lanterns around the restaurant and fun music always playing. When you walk in the host will direct you to sit down and hand you menus. The menus aren't large or overwhelming but they have a lot to offer. The prices are also really good and you won't be paying a ton out of pocket if you eat here. I believe that they have lunch specials for the cheap but I'm not usually around for lunch so I cannot be sure. I do know they have a Groupon and the Living Social coupon so you can even buy one of those to save even more money. I usually like to get the chicken kabob and my partner likes to get the Iraqi kabob. Both come with three skewers of meat, a salad, saffron rice, pita, and some taziki sauce. It is more than enough food to have some for extra the next day. But sometimes it's so good that you end up eating all of it and being sad that you don't have anything for lunch. The service is always really nice. They know how to make you feel comfortable and welcome. In the food is out of this world. Really you should try it, and they're even open late. If you are in the Lawrenceville area I would really suggest coming here to enjoy some delicious food. You will not be disappointed.",

I got the falafel wrap which was exactly what I expected.   We went in back for hookah after dinner, it was empty when we got there and they claimed they couldn't change the channel from wrestling on the tv. Shisha was good, staff was not attentive however. Once more people arrived they were able to change the channel (!) to a movie, but were also playing two different music channels on either side of me. This plus the lack of service (we waited so long for someone to come back in the room so we could get more coals but after waiting 15 mins we gave up) we decided to leave earlier than intended. If this place had more staff especially once it gets busier on a Saturday night it could be better.",

It was a Sunday evening and I believed we were the only customers there. So I was kind of surprised that they would make such mistake.   But hey, people make mistakes and I reviewed restaurant based on my enjoyment of the food more than anything else. And the kebab was delicious, soft, well-seasoned, juicy, not too lean not too fat, grilled to perfection. It was on the salty side if eaten alone but you got the yogurt dipping sauce to balance the saltiness off. The portion is also satisfying. I couldn't finish the rice but it was some nice and fluffy rice.  I took the star of because my friend who got the mixed grill plate said that her other non-kebab meat was probably over cooked and hard to chew. So I guess that's something to avoid?   We chose this place only because it was across the row house cinema and it was the only Iraq restaurant I knew in this area. Maybe I wouldn't travel all the way here to get a bite, but next time if I'm going to movies or hanging out in lawrenceville I may visit again.",

Parking was a breeze surprisingly but sometimes parking in this area can be a real pain and this restaurant doesn't have its own lot sadly. On walking in it was a slow night around 6pm. After sitting down at our table we where greeted not long after but a very sweet lady. She want over the menu with us and said they where running a half chicken with rice so I got that. My friends got the falafel and the mixed kabobs with rice. We started with the grape leafs and a fried pastry with cheese. The grape leafs where more on the softer side not much rice to them so didn't have that snap. Both where really great and flavorful. My two guest loved there food and said the dish had a lot of flavor. I really enjoyed my chicken and it was so tender and juicy but the bad part was the rice was so dry and flavorless. To me with middle eastern style food the rice is a massive part of the dish and it just didn't it for me. We ended the meal with baklava and it was just pretty plane nothing crazy. Overall the staff where friendly and the service was great but I wouldn't go out of my way to come to this place being there's a lot of other middle eastern style places around.",

The decor of the main dining area was nice with different antiques and an Iraqi feel to the place, and the service was good.

    "text": "My husband and I order Dijlah through GrubHub quite often and we are never disappointed! Easily one of our favorite Middle Eastern restaurants in the city.   Everything I have tasted from this place is melt in your mouth delicious. I personally love the chicken shawarma saj sandwich. My husband really likes the meat shawarma plate. I am always stealing some of the delicious rice when he orders that! Plenty of tasty vegetarian options as well. The falafel wrap is a must try for everyone.   For ordering delivery, they have some of the best fries (and you can't beat the price). Perfectly crispy and they never arrive soggy when ordering out. After you try the fries, you have to try the Sigara Borek. Both the feta and potato versions are great.    I love this place and never hesitate ordering from them. You must try it!",

So flavorful and juicy - i got the Iraqi kebab (mix of ground beef and lamb). It came with rice and salad but i added a grilled tomato and onion. Oh also my friend and I shared the combination appetizer - hummus, baba ganoush, olives, tabbouli salad. The hummus and baba ganoush were to die for but the tabbouli salad could have used less parsley and more bulgar.   Arabic music played in the sitting area, and the furniture, although a bit outdated and cheesy was that of a typical authentic Mediterranean place, so in this case it was appreciated. Only reason i give 4 star instead of 5 is because the waitress took 15 minutes to even bring us water/take our order. Other than that - i would definitely return!",

    "text": "For 2 years in a row, my boyfriend and I have ended up having dinner at Dijlah right around our anniversary (2/17) - completely by accident. But they've been two INCREDIBLY delicious accidents! This year we were on a double-date and opted to order the Dijlah Dinner for 5, and also ordered hummus as an appetizer. Dijlah's hummus is out of this world - perfectly creamy, not to salty, not too garlicy (although I do like a lot of garlic!), and topped with flavorful olive oil. YUM. It did not last long between the 4 of us! The dinner was delicious, but note that it's mostly meat and rice, and some falafel (some fries and pita, but minimal compared to to the main dish), so if you're looking to cut out animal fat and carbs, this is not the dish for you! But if you're a meat lover...and you like rich, herby, meats with tons of flavor, you will be in food heaven! My favorite was the shawarma, but bonus points for the vegetarian yummy falafel!  The atmosphere is unique - I can see how some folks might have a love-hate relationship with it. It's open and airy and echo-ey, but the booths are decorated with comfy pillows and cushions, so it's got a \"personal\" touch also. The music is loud, but super cool. I personally loved it!",

However, Iraqis like Persians add a spicy flare twist to their grills. Gives it an edgy flavor. The added authenticity to the place was also nice. The comfy seating, and traditional middle eastern decorations and light lamps hanging off the ceiling. I'll definitely be back to try more Arabic dishes. Friendly staff and I think they tried to keep on top of things for all diners. There were couple of big group tables so that tends to occupy them more than smaller tables which is expected.

The first time, I ordered the Iraqi kabob platter with rice and salad, and my boyfriend had the chicken shawarma platter. We also split some baba ganoush with pita. The portions were HUGE and the flavors were really good. I personally preferred the chicken shawarma, but both really delicious. The second time, I tried the chicken shawarma wrap, which came with a side of delicious crispy fries. This was such a steal! The wrap was huge and had their yummy garlic sauce in it, and they gave plenty of fries on the side.   I would definitely recommend this place for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal!",

    "text": "I am writing this review out of disappointment,and pretty hungry I might add. Being that I was raised on middle eastern food my entire life, I feel this was the worst I've ever had. Me and the bf stayed in bed all day and didn't feel like cooking, but were craving something really good. He stated he was craving dolmas after having some extraordinary ones at kassabs on the south side. So it was decided we were going to place a order through postmates. We decided on 2 orders of their stuffed grape leaves,a chicken shawarma wrap, and the grilled lamb entree. The order arrived in a short time,and at this point we were starving and had our tastebuds ready for some flavorful fare, instead what we received was super salty,gristly poor quality food. Starting with the grape leaves,SALT. That was the only thing we were able to taste. They arrived messy and and loose,rice busting out of them. The texture itself was a mushy salty mess and they were burned! Meaning they were cooked improperly and left in a warmer all day,allowing the leave to become burnt. He was so exited to have dolmas again as he is new to middle eastern/ethnic food and I'm disappointed that this is what he experienced. Next we have the chicken shawarma, a classic and comfortable introduction to Mid East food that some how managed to fail miserably. The meat tasted gamey and dirty and was a strange color. It was almost a reddish grey color and clearly a really cheap cut. It Taste like boiled chicken thighs. No seasoning,no spice,no flavor but a nasty dirty after taste. And finally, coup de grace....the Lamb Tekka, which I was really looking forward to was inedible. Upon opening the container,the bf and I were both impressed by how it looked and the presentation, sadly were left more than disappointed,disgusted is a understatement. What I was expecting to me succulent medium cooked chunks of beautiful lamb,we received the driest, fatty,gristle and sinew laden piece of meat I've ever had on my plate. We attempted to each eat a piece,but we were defeated and refused to pick through the coagulum of fibrous animal tissue.I couldn't believe that this restaurant that a getting rave reviews would serve such poor quality cuts of meat. The only reason I could begin to imagine anyone would give this place over one star is if they never had middle eastern food, and they have no clue what it's supposed to taste <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flike.So&s=52da9c769ca2b184310b550d54b02b93c18e5f928cc5f0fd6b16f2613c11cfb5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">like.So</a> here is where I drop the mic.",

I ordered the Iraqi kebab, which came with some fatty basmati rice (yum), salad, and pita slices. Man, this meal really hit the spot! The kebab, which was a combination of beef and lamb, was flavorful and zesty but not overwhelming or too greasy, which can happen with kebabs if you're not careful. One of my friends ordered the tabouli wrap which was the perfect marriage of its namesake, fries, hummus, and lettuce. I'm definitely coming back to get some more kebabs and babaganush, grape leaves, etc. Honestly, I might make an effort to try everything on the menu because the prices are pretty reasonable! My only complaint about Dijlah is that the atmosphere left something to be desired... There was no music or anything, so the restaurant was sometimes very quiet, which made me like only whispering was appropriate... But despite that nonsense, I'm a True fan! 10/10 would recommend.",
