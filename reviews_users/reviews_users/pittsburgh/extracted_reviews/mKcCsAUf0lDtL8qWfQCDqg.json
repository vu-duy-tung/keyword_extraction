We did you a favor.\" He was the manager and wouldn't budge on the price. We had company over so I just paid it.",

I've had their pizza, breadsticks, hoagie and fries. All very good! When we ate at the shop, I really enjoyed their second dining room of to the side.

Old thoughts: Taste like College pizza- not good, not horrible gross, just boring pizza.  I will say they do a lot of fun types of pizza, but we live close to too many really really exceptional good pizzas to waste too much money here.    THE THREE STARS: for a very good Italian sub and over all low prices.  Its hard to have pizza as much as I would want it, but I would hit them up for subs ANYTIME. VERY GOOD.  Baked fresh.",

I've always thought they were a little expensive for the quality of pizza that you get, but they were always fast and convenient.  Last night I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and it was totally flat (less than 1/4 inch), greasy, undercooked crust, cheese that just slid off the pizza, and funky tasting on top of all that.  Needless to say I was not pleased and I took the pizza back.  The owner did refund my money, which I appreciate, but he then asked me if I had ever had this pizza (God forbid I try something new) and when I replied no, he said \"Well, that's what the pizza is.\" So I guess that means their buffalo chicken pizza is crap.  No apologies, no remorse that I found the pizza terrible, nothing.  No more business of mine then.",

Tonight, I once again ordered delivery and decided to try the Chicken-Brocolli Alfredo for the first time. It arrived sooner than the 45 minute quote time and was wonderful. After eating my way through this awesome dish, I noticed there was no brocolli at all. I decided to call Rialto, just to let them know that the brocolli was missing. The nice gentleman appologised for my inconvenience, (even though there was no inconvenience, and the food was great). He also insisted on applying a credit to my account (which I tried to decline) and he would not hear from that. I, applaud Rialto employees for representing their business in such a professional manner. It make me want to support this establishment, and i will.  Cheers, Scott (Beechwood Blvd)",

The prices are about what you'd expect, but if you can get your hands on a coupon or a code from AllMenus, then it becomes super cheap - we got a large pizza from $8 due to a coupon code.  So look into that!  It was ready when they said it would be, and we brought it back to our apartment, ready to dig in.  We'd ordered a large \"Rialto House\" pizza, which is under the specialty part of the menu.  We opened the box to discover a mass of fresh toppings - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and olives.  After a quick warming-up in the oven, we dug in.  I have to say, the toppings really make this pizza.  Sure, there's sauce and cheese under there, but neither to excess.  The toppings, however, are plentiful and high quality.  The peppers were fresh and crisp - I even enjoyed the mushrooms which I usually loathe.  And they weren't stingy about piling them on - nothing is worse than paying a lot for a pizza and then having to hunt for the few lonely pepperoni slices.  You pay for toppings, you should get a bunch of them.  The pizza wasn't oily or greasy either.  We really enjoyed this pie, and would definitely order again.  I think if you're in the mood for greasy, cheesy goodness (which we are, from time to time), this is not the place.  But if you want a fresh pizza loaded with toppings and not loaded with grease, I'd recommend Rialto!",

Their sides don't quite match up to their pizza... the Greek salad doesn't have much about it that could be Greek, the zucchini strips leave something to be desired.

That being said, they have some of the best and most creative pizza in Pittsburgh.  Their steak and fries pizza is always one that we get when we have friends in from out of town.  The Giant, while being a little more costly per square inch -- yes we did the math on this -- is always impressive when you bring it home to a group of ravenous friends.  The pizza is well done, not overly greasy, and generally a good price.  If you're someone who lives in Greenfield or Squirrel Hill you owe it to yourself to check them out (actually, if you're in Greenfield, they're the best pizza in the neighborhood).",

    "text": "My first experience with Rialto was unimpressive at best. I felt I way overpaid for a pizza that stood apart from no other toss n bake pizza. My second experience was better. I still paid a premium (nearly twice a competitors price) for an Italian hoagie. The hoagie impressed me so I figured this would just be an occasional hoagie fix foir me. Until today.   Today I decided to gain back twice the calories I dumped on my bicycle ride. I stopped in and the A/C was nice so I decided to eat in. I ordered an Italian hoagie again, no tomatoes (I'm allergic). I was told 5 minutes and had a seat.   Now there was an older man there eating a pie. I casually noticed he was eyeballing me. a few moments later he sauntered right past me and interrupted a table full of patrons as if he knew them. He began asking a young woman about her bag insisting he wanted a bag just like it (I think it was her purse). He carried on and on while they listened with puzzled facial expressions. I could tell they were uncomfortable. Other patrons took notice as well. He concluded by introducing himself by name and informing the woman that if she didn't want her bag, he would take it.   Now i'm sure this man is harmless. Probably a regular from the neighborhood who just needs social interaction but lost his social skills during a tragic fall. The place probably even has a nickname for him. None the less I determined I would just take my order to go now and hopefully before he got to my table. Until it was placed in front of me. It had tomatoes.   I explained I asked for no tomatoes. The man looked at the receipt, looked at the hoagie, and went through the motions of a mental conflict of what to do next. He explained 'I'll just throw this away and make you a new one'. I said i'd like it to go now. He left the hoagie and started walking away. He did a double take, asked me what I wanted him to do as if we didn't just discuss it. I explained, i'll take a new one; to go.   Precisely 120 seconds later a bag fell onto the table and a 'sorry about that sir' was murmured out of left field. No way this was a fresh hot hoagie. If you want to take it to the back, pick the tomatoes off, toss it in the oven for 60 seconds and dump it back in front of me you might consider allergens. The food is tainted now and a greater liability to your business than the loss of a hoagie. You also lost a customer.   I don't like waste. But food restrictions are food restrictions. I would have picked them off myself if it was ok to do so. The receipt says 'no tomatoe' in red. You screwed up, you eat it. Further you shouldn't allow patrons to wander about table to table and harass other patrons. To think I spent money on that experience. Never again.",

It's a staple for us here in Greenfield - we order here pretty regularly. The food is consistently good, though some items are better than others. Our go-to is the Hawaiian because the ham and bacon are so good. I love ordering from somewhere local vs a chain bc the food and the service are so much better. You won't find a texting teenager behind the register. If you're looking for a reliable place to get some quick Italian eats, I recommend you give Rialto's a shot!",

Darn near everyone does them, but Rialto is a cut above.  3. The Rialto Giant (28 inches, 49 slices) is too big to fit in my front door, but if you're having people over for a game or a party it's perfect. Tip: Use it as an incentive on moving day. You'll have more help (and more pizza) than you'll know what to do with.  4. An admirable selection of decently-priced beer means not having to make two stops on the way home.  5. If there's no game on t.v., guaranteed they are playing some basic cable reality show (which is the television equivalent of eating pizza).",

Only once I have a been disappointed by the quality of Rialto Pizza. Yet the many check-ins before and after more than make up for that one occurrence.  Given its location it caters to those ordering take-out or delivery. Only a few times have a noticed people dining in. They are quick and True to their word. Every time I have ordered, the food has been ready within 15 minutes.   Though their pizza (and specialty pizzas) is fantastic, what keeps me coming back is their desire to meet consumer needs. Occasionally I have made special requests, and they always obliged. Their service continues to meet demand. It does not hurt that they secondarily function as a mini-beer distributor.  If you are looking for a cheap, tasty and friendly place to eat a pizza, where you can also customize your own six-pack of beer, this is the place to go!",

There are always coupons for this place and even if you don't have any you can ask over the phone and they will usually give you a deal. They always say it will take 45 mins for delivery but in my experience it's usually about 20-30 mins.

Their pizzas are pretty expensive for the quality and in comparison to other pizza restaurnts. We paid $24 for our large.

Friday evening, I placed an order online. It said, my order would be delivered in 45 mins. 45 minutes later, I called and the kid that answered said it was out for delivery. Being that I live in hazelwood, I said cool, it will be here any minute. 15 minutes later, a whole hour after I ordered, I called again. A female answered. I'm looking for an apology, maybe a free pop next time I order, but I got a snappy comeback of \"well it's the dinner rush, we're busy\" to which I asked for a manager . She said she is the manager, so my reply was to suggest maybe they should increase their staff. I asked to speak with the store manager or someone else and she hung up on me . I called back got a guy who also said he was a manager .  I explained the situation, pizza was over and hour and ten minutes late at this point and he interrupts many times as she did and tells me I shouldn't have ordered online , I should have picked it up, I shouldn't order during their busy time , all the while I hear the female in the background, talking crap, so loud I hear her through the phone . I said it's not good customer service to scream about your customers, in front of other customers, and I need to know the managers name . This guy told me to perform a sexual act on myself and he hung up. I called today, Saturday, the \"manager\" answered the phone. I started telling him about the situation, and He interrupted and said when u order online there is a delay, I started to say something back to him but he interrupted ME, the customer, the one who was wronged and he said I LISTENED TO YOU, NOW YOU ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO ME. I said \"excuse me\" and this guy hung up on me. I called back, and said did you hang up, he says yes, and I'm blocking you . If you ever want to order from here again, you will never be allowed to , you will not get away with being rude and treating his employees like dirt . At that point, I hung up. Please friends, please boycott this place.",

The food is high-quality and the service is always prompt and polite.   On a recent visit I ordered the tossed salad (cuz veggies are important). I was pleasantly surprised to find that this wasn't the standard pizzeria salad (ie iceburg lettuce with whole black olives). The lettuce was crisp and fresh (a nice green leaf lettuce) with peppers, cheese and a breadstick.   We ordered a small personal pan for the kiddo and a Sicilian pizza for ourselves. The Sicilian was great - a great crust with a perfectly seasoned sauce.   Here are a few of my tips: - Come for the pizza, stay for the rest. The menu is big and everything is good. Why not get something in addition to your pizza? - Rialto's has a surprisingly great beer selection. Bring your ID, cuz pizza and beer are fantastic.  - Leave a few minutes early if you are picking up. Parking is limited.  - Get the pirogi pizza. Its amazing! Why should I even have to tell you this?",

    "text": "Just moved into the area and decided to try the Rialto House pizza to see what this place was all about. Was not disappointed. Order for pickup, ready in 15 minutes. We walked over and took a look at the beer selection. $12.99 for a 6 of Magic Hat, not bad. Walked the pizza and beer home and was very happy with the pair. It's your typical local pizza spot and I'm happy to say this is very good and will frequent it when I'm in the mood for a slice. Good service. Decent beer selection. And really tasty. Will put into rotation. 4/5 stars  Buffalo Chicken Pizza was very good. It's like BC dip on a tasty crust with a few added chunks of chicken on top to boot. 4/5 stars",

Their was a young boy at the register waiting to ring me up and the owner moved him to the side with a nasty attitude and asked me what do I want!!! But mind you I wasn't done looking at the menu. And I felt rushed. It's one thing if the employees are rude but it's a lot more if the owner is rude too! This place will NEVER EVER receive any of my hardworking funds........ that was my first time there and it definitely was my last!",

    "text": "Decent food, incredibly unprofessional service. Placed a take-out pizza order this past weekend. Arrived to pick it up at the designated time. Person at the counter looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about. Proceeded to locate my order ticket and THEN just start making my pizzas while I stood there. No explanation, no apology, nothing. But, it was obvious that they hadn't even started making the pizzas.  A few minutes later, two of the employees behind the counter get into a shouting argument. one points at ME and tells the other one \"YOU SHOULD BE YELLING AT THAT GUY.\"  No idea what that was about, but it was completely unacceptable. I had no interaction with either of those clowns. Nobody made any effort to ask whether everything was OK, apologize for me having to wait, or make an excuse for the shouting match that went on behind the counter.  The food isn't SO amazing as to make that behavior acceptable. Your mileage may vary, maybe I caught them on an off night, but there are literally a dozen other pizza places within 5 minutes of Rialto, so won't be going back.",

    "text": "Usually decent.   Staff is extremely rude on the phone. Don't apologize when a delivery is 30 mins late, or when there is an issue with your order, or when you arrive and the order has not been completed. Older delivery guy has been to my house, and on several occasions he shoves crushed pizza boxes to me while on the phone yelling at someone on the other end. If you live close, avoid the delivery fee and cold, crushed pizza delivered by an angry disgruntled man.   Was charged $12.95 for a 6 pack, when the 12 pack was $13.95. I left without noticing. Called, and asked the employee if he really charged me $12.95 for a 6 pack, and he said \"yeah\", and I asked is the 12 pack really $13.95, and he said \"yeah\". And then I asked why he didn't tell me that? Came back to the restaurant where the owner confronted me and started yelling that I was \"f*cking yelling\" at his employee when I clearly knew the prices and was costing him 50 cents for using my credit card. Well, nothing is clearly labeled, and it's also my prerogative to use a credit card so ... (ps his employee charged me incorrectly for the 12 pack anyways, so the owner got his 50 cents).   Due to the hit or miss pizza (30% of the time it's burnt) and being yelled at by the owner when he's trying to swindle local repeat customers, I will no longer be giving them my business.",

Second time I ordered a pierogi pizza and a calzone. They were not so good. I wasn't expecting to blown away based on the first pizza experience, but I was expecting acceptable. The pierogi pizza was bland & the calzone was a yucky, sloppy, goopy, bland, mess.   Also, delivery guy #2 was a complete ass - no need to call me & force me to run for my phone when I'm standing at my door and I could hear your car coming from a block away. I won't order from them again.   I might check out the place to dine-in and see if those breadsticks are all they're cracked up to be. Until then, two stars. Very disappointing.",
