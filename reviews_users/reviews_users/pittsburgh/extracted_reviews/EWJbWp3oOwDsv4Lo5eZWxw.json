Almost everything is homemade, including the salad dressings. They always have a nice selection of daily specials including 2 different soups. I especially love their lentil soup. Also, they have the best chicken fingers. They are hand cut and freshly breaded. So yummy! The breakfast fare is just as tasty with homemade pancakes, french toast and belgian waffles. Their desserts are to die for as well. When passing through the Forest Hills area, stop in to Drew's. You won't be disappointed.",

The food is exactly what you would expect from a diner-style establishment-- excellent home-cooked fare. Breakfasts are always good-- my kids tend to stick with pancakes, French toast and waffles. I usually get an egg dish and I've never been disappointed. Their fish sandwich is delish and their salads are huge. My husband loves the tuna melt. The fries sometimes tend to be a little underdone for my tastes, but if you ask for them crispy, they'll cook them longer. The portions are enormous. The owners are almost always around, and if you have a problem, ask for them. We love Drew's and appreciate the personal service.",

    "text": "Meh. I have reviewed this restaurant more positively in the past and to be honest I don't know what has happened to them. They seem to be heading downhill in quality and uphill on price. There are flies around the main dining area even in the dead of winter and on looking around it becomes obvious that the place hasn't been given a deep cleaning in many years. Given the geriatric clientele that makes up the bulk of regular customers, it can be expected that the decor looks like a mishmash of 70s and 80s generic diner/hotel tchotchkis, but one at least expects a general dusting of fixtures from time to time rather than dustbunnies flying freely through the air.  As for the food, dinner is what they seem best at. The last time I was there was unfortunately breakfast and I had high hopes for the \"frittatta omelet\" which tunred out to be nothing more than a severely overcooked egg (browned rubber) with canned tomato sauce poured over it and the flavor was horrifying. For dinners there, I stick to the basics that you could expect to be reasonably fresh. If it sounds too exotic, it is probably from the back of a freezer or out of a can. The desserts are from off-site so they are the usual mixture of cakes and pies. I do enjoy their hot turkey sandwich still, but I have not ordered a salad since receiving a plate full of water with leaves of lettuce on it (and tomatoes/hard boiled eggs even though it was supposed to be a ceasar salad).",

The walls are covered in some sort of period art that looks like a mix between the 90's and the 40's.  Lots of manufactured curves, metallic colors, and straight lines.  Even the salad bowls get in on the act.  Kind of space-age without the space suit.  The lunch menu revolves (perhaps.. orbits?) around melts.  Honestly, they're kind of expensive.  I didn't want to make my boss pay for one.  Instead I had the cheeseburger deluxe.  Nothing deluxe about this cheeseburger.  You'll get comparable size and taste at the local Wendy's.  However, my coworker's steak salad was HUGE.  I think you may get twice the food for the same price.  The service is friendly and efficient.

The reason that he gives the waitress to tell you  is that it cost to boil the water and wash dishes.

I'm pretty sure my waiter forgot about me as I was seated in what I like to call the \"uncool\" section.

It's the kind of restaurant that large franchises like Denny's or even smaller ones like Eat 'n Park aspire to, but fall short.  I've eaten there for years and have never, EVER been disappointed in the food OR service.  The best breakfast in my opinion is the corned beef hash with eggs any style. I'll order it for lunch or dinner as well. The corned beef is fresh and grilled with chopped homestyle potatoes...the little crispy bits of potatoes, corned beef and onions make the dish truly remarkable.  Pancakes are a delicious filling alternative and put the pancakes at other places to shame. For lunch, you can't go wrong with a simple cheeseburger, but if you like a Reuben, order one of Drew's. You won't be sorry. Their club sandwich, a sandwich that has become a mainstay at diners and restaurants like Drew's is also exceptional.  Dessert wise, I am a pie kind of guy and the pies are first rate at Drew's. And so much better than Eat 'N Park's selections, but you will be amazed at the specialty cakes offered as desserts here. Just wonderful and fresh.  As I write this review, Drew's has been offering one night a month designated as GREEK NIGHT. If you are a fan of Greek food, you MUST show up for Drew's GREEK NIGHT affair. But get there early, anyone on the know, knows that Greek Night is NOT to be missed at this fine restaurant.",

Such was the case when I stopped in here last week.  I was mighty tempted by the hot roast turkey and potatoes, but for my money, nothin' says lunch in a diner like a good club sandwich.  I had the turkey club--basically a BLT with sliced turkey.  With a side of coleslaw and some coffee, it was just right.  As stated before, Drew;'s has been a Forest Hills icon for many years.  In fact, it's been around for over a century.  In my book, Drew's rates a solid 3 to 3.5 stars.  Ps.  I think my husband Rick and I will be back for Greek Night on November 8, 2014.",

It's moderately priced for a diner, but it's well worth it for the service and quality.   One of my favorite things here is their PIZZA. My friends and I got it thinking that eight slices wouldn't be enough for us, but we were surprised that the pizza was both massive and filling. It's easily some of the best pizza I've ever had, but it does weigh on you a little heavily.   The fried mushrooms and zucchini are also delicious appetizers. I love mushrooms, and getting them fried is a treat for me.   Their breakfast is also pretty delicious. These pancakes put Denny's and iHop to shame, and the little bowl of whipped cream certainly makes it even better for a sugar addict like myself.   My favorite part of this diner though is probably their cakes. They are unbelievably decadent, fairly priced for the portion you get and so so so so good.   Dining at Drew's makes me feel like I'm part of an undiscovered secret nestled in Forest Hills. The good food and incredible service makes me smile every time I come here, and I always look forward to my next visit.",

Drew's was easy to find and we had no problems with parking. It almost reminded us of a King's. There was no wait for a Saturday morning (8:30am) and there was plenty of seating. Our waitress was attentive and polite. My husband ordered the Breakfast Sampler (french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage). According to him, the french toast was \"excellent\" and eggs were \"cooked exactly right\" (over-medium). I had the Belgian Waffle and added eggs (2). Everything was really good and the best part was the warm syrup. Even the iced tea was better than most diners I've been to. It's a shame this place isn't too close for us or we would definitely go more often!",

I personally like trying all kinds of different breakfast items and have ordered almost every item off of their breakfast menu.  I would say that they have a nice selection of items for breakfast and there are few that I would say I did not enjoy.  Their corned beef hash is very tasty.  I often times will order it with smoked salmon instead of corned beef, and enjoy the smokey flavor of that dish.     Overall, it's fun to consider myself a local at the neighborhood diner.  I wouldn't say you should come to Drew's and expect a gourmet breakfast, with the freshest ingredients; but if you are looking for a place with good omelets, pancakes, and eggs then this is the place!",

The newer daily specials and side dish vegetables are especially nice for dinner.   As an archetypal diner and family restaurant Drew's doesn't have a ton of options for people with dietary restrictions, but with a little careful attention to the menu and help from the friendly staff, everyone should be able to find at least something to eat there.",

En route to Gram and Pap's house, my family always passed Drew's Restaurant.  I always wondered what it was like inside.  Now that I spend a great deal of time in Forest Hills, I have had the opportunity to stop in a few times.  Drew's is your typical family diner, with tasty breakfasts, daily specials, and mediocre dinners.   The cook is a bit ornery, but he's adept at what he does.  The silver-haired waitresses remind me of my 6th grade math teacher.  Oh sure, she has a heart of gold and certainly wants you to succeed, but that doesn't change the fact that 1. she doesn't want to be there and 2. will send your butt to detention if you pass a note in class and no, you can't use the restroom right now.  We're taking a pop quiz on proofs and that takes precedence over your bladder.   Where was I?  The breakfasts are hearty and well-prepared. I enjoy both the Ionian (Greek) and Italian omelettes.  They are served with two pieces of toast and have have easily been split between myself and my boyfriend for a well-portioned start to our day.   I'd steer clear from their dinners. I don't understand why liver and onions is always a special at these diner-type places.  Do post-Cold War Americans ever eat liver and onions?  I'm genuinely curious.   Overall, not a bad place. Stop in for an omelette and a scolding from the waitresses if you're ever on Ardmore Blvd.",

    "text": "Drew's is what you want in your little neighborhood diner. It's casual. Families are welcome. The staff smile a lot and are generally friendly folks. It's relaxed. The menu features lots of comfort food. It's a classic local diner.  Breakfast at Drew's is a very popular draw for those who live in Forest Hills and other nearby neighborhoods such as Regent Square and Braddock Hills. It's not as cheap as you might expect a diner breakfast to be, but the food is certainly good. I love their Belgian waffles, in particular. They are perfectly golden, crisp on the outside, tender inside, and topped with real maple syrup. The eggs benedict are also delectable and at Drew's, they really do poach the eggs. (What good is eggs benedict without runny yolks - salmonella be damned?)   Lunch brings an array of soups, salads, burgers and sandwiches that are basic but tasty. If you want sides, for $3.50 you can upgrade to a platter and get fries, coleslaw, and a cup of soup along with your main event.   As for dinner, the choices are very much \"mom's home cooking\" kinds of choices: meatloaf, liver and onions (hard to find these days), baked scrod, veal parmigiana.   Again, prices are a bit more than you might expect for a diner, but not terrible. (For dinner, you'll pay anywhere from $10 - $20 for your entree, depending on what you select.) And in all honesty, I would rather spend an extra $3 to eat at a local, independently-owned restaurant than give my hard-earned money over to a mega-corporation that is killing businesses like Drew's.   The bottom line: Drew's is a decent, friendly neighborhood diner with excellent food and a relaxed atmosphere. It's not the cheapest place, but it's reasonable and worth a few extra bucks.",

Everyone at the table was trying to figure out what to do with all the extra lettuce because you couldn't really eat it with how full it was. I can't really complain about my meal, I mean it was good I just left a little hungry that's all. I think I could have eat two of the samplers and been full.  It's one of the few restaurants in Forest Hills so I want it to stick around for a while. I will have to go in and have some more of Drew's offerings to give you a more well rounded idea of the place.",

The sandwiches and pancakes are probably their weakest offerings, deserving a four star rating.  The omelets are flavorful but a warning: they tend to be a bit dry. The dinner plates are all very good, and the corned beef hash is wonderful!  All the fish plates have been worth it as are the breakfast platters.   The restaurant is generally very clean.",

    "text": "this place has become my breakfast place when I'm hungry on weekend mornings.  I really like this place is still its own diner. Unfortunately in this area east of Pittsburgh a lot of the independent diners of going away in all we're left with are chain restaurants.  I have always found the staff to be very engaging here and they do a great job taking care of you.  I can't tell you how many times I've been at this place early on a Saturday or Sunday morning and there are people sitting at the counter actually talking to each other. I've had most of the breakfast dishes and most of them are very good.  my wife always goes for a BLT or a toasted cheese sandwich and she likes it enough that she comes back with me when I go here.  I have to say that for breakfast if you get one of the sides they can be rather large sometimes. Not a bad thing.",

My go-to for the first time at a new diner is a turkey club.  It's a sandwich I won't make at home because it's rare I have all the ingredients on-hand, but an easy sammie to execute at any level.  I like it with honey mustard over mayo, on white toast, with a pickle.  And Drew's knocked it out of the park for one reason: it's real, sliced turkey!!!  Not some processed, gelatinous deli meat, but actual sliced turkey!  I couldn't believe it and now I'm spoiled on club sandwiches for a long time.  And the honey mustard--house made!  Excellent!",

We went in an hour to closing and were met with a not-so-friendly hostess who made it seem like we were a bother. She took us to our table, put the menus down, and just walked away. It took a couple of minutes for our waitress to greet us, but she was very nice.   We finally ordered and got a fried chicken sandwich and burger. Our meals did not take long to come out at all. However, they weren't the best. The chicken sandwich looked extremely delicious and the breading was, but the chicken inside was extremely dry. My husband got the burger and like the char-grilled taste of the burger, but it was dry too. The fries were mediocre.   Our waitress was very attentive throughout the whole meal and refilled our drinks anytime they were empty.   We thought everything was pretty expensive. Sandwiches don't come with a side, so by the time you add a fries or even another side, a plate is over $10. Two of us ate for $28. This wouldn't be terrible for a nicer restaurant, but for a diner we think it is extremely overpriced.  All in all, it wasn't the worst experience, but we will definitely not be returning to Drew's in the near future and definitely not for dinner.",

    "text": "Drew's has been around for over 100 years and has been a staple in the area. I remember my parents bringing me here when I was little....and I remembered their breakfasts were delicious! My parents still come out here all of the time and love it. My husband, parents, and I stopped here for dinner last night and I just don't remember it being as great as when I was younger.  First of all, it was dinnertime and, naturally, pretty busy. The restaurant is broken up into five sections of tables and some booths, plus a counter. My mom and I asked the hostess for a booth. He said there weren't any available. I pointed out that there was, in fact, two booths, but they needed bused. We'd wait, no biggie. He wasn't very happy about this, but an older woman spoke up and said that she would take care of clearing the table, which we were thankful for since the only other places open were two tables smack dab in the middle of one of the rooms (no thanks, hello anxiety!) or the counter (not conducive for a group of 4).  My parents and husband were happy with their meals - liver and onions and sides, pot roast and sides, and hot turkey and fries. I thought that the dinner prices were outrageous for a diner, so I went with a grilled chicken sandwich...$6.50. Great, but it only comes with potato chips. I ended up getting two sides for an additional $3.95 which then makes my chicken Sammy a little pricey. I got a salad and fries as my sides. Everything was good, but a little expensive. My husband got dessert (shocker!)...it was called Chocolate Explosion or Chocolate Eruption, something like that. I was surprised to find out that they didn't make their desserts, and that they were from Keystone Bakery. Still, I had a bit (or two) and it was yummy.  The other 'negatives' were 1) our waiter, although friendly, was slow. And you had to ask for everything: refills, napkins, the bill....huge pet peeve of mine. 2) it was absolutely freezing cold. I mean, I realize that restaurants generally keep the AC at a lower temp, but it felt like 60 degrees in there. So, I'd go back to try their breakfast since it's been so long or even maybe give lunch or dinner one more try, but Drew's just wasn't as great as I remembered.",

    "text": "This place was put on my radar once my friend told me about how good of diner food they have, and I am a sucker for some good diner food.  Having time to kill between running errands and work I decided that I needed to get some stomach-filling food.  The type of food that makes you feel full for the remainder of the day.  Pulling in here you notice that this place does not have the typical diner look.  In fact it looks like any old restaurant you may come across along the road.  The lot itself has ample parking which was a pleasant surprise.    Once I entered I decided to take a seat at the counter top inside of taking up a whole booth to myself.  Best decision to make here.  You get to see everything that happens inside this space.  You get to see that hostess greet the staff, the serving staff buzzing around, and the cooks in the back working as if there were no obstacles to their job.  Without asking water showed up in front of me, which I liked.  No need to wait for a drink.  After skimming over the descriptions of the meals available I needed not go any further once I saw meatloaf.  I can't tell you why, but when I think of diner food, I always end up thinking about meatloaf.  So that is what I got here, their version of meatloaf which they called Hot Baked Meatloaf.  Basically a hot meatloaf sandwich smothered with gravy and your choice of potato.  Of course I went with mashed as it seems to be an appropriate pairing for a meatloaf dinner, also smothered in gravy.  The meatloaf itself was so tender, it was fall apart tender.  Each bite I took I mixed it all together; bread, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  So good that I didn't put my knife and fork down until I was done and almost to the point of scraping the plate to every last bit was gone.  The staff were so pleasant and not overbearing at all.  You could tell that they enjoyed their job and their patrons.  You could also tell who the regulars are as they walked through the doors.  Every one that was a regular was greeted by name and basically asked the same question, \"The usual?\"  I think I need to start coming here regularly, so that I can get what I want on a consistent basis.",

My only complaint is it was cold inside at our table and the waitress was a little slow to attend to us but she was super friendly and thanked us for waiting.",

    "text": "Drew's is too big to be called a diner, and kind of has a chain restaurant feel to it, but it was still pretty good. Their omelets are \"made to order,\" although I'm not sure how that compares to other restaurants. And they have English muffin toast, which I've never even heard of before. (Basically the inside of a muffin in square bread form.)  I ordered an omelet author broccoli, ham and feta. The chunks of broccoli and ham were huge, but it definitely could have used more cheese. Both my wife and I ordered sides of fruit which were pretty big compared to other breakfast spots.   The service was good and the food wasn't bad, so we will probably be back.",

    "text": "Drew's is the go-to brunch place for when visitors come to town.   The decor is simple and clean, not modern or kitschy. Usually the display case is full of delicious desserts you can have at the table or to-go, but I suspect that 2pm is too late if you wanted to see the full selection. It can get very crowded right after church on Sundays, so avoid 10am-2pm if you don't want to wait a little while.  The server I had most recently was friendly and observant. She gave us time to browse the menu, answered questions, and offered a refill on my coffee (rare these days).   My friend ordered buffalo wings off of the appetizer menu and a side of fries. I was worried it wasn't going to be enough, but the plate of oversized wing dings was plenty (she took half of it home). I ordered the breakfast sampler with french toast, all bacon, and eggs over easy. My eggs were perfect: solid whites, with warm runny yolk. The bacon was more crisp that it looked, which is great because I almost sent it back for more cook time. Finally- the french toast was terrible. I was astounded by how bad it was. It tasted just like buttered white toast- no cinnamon, no egg, no other flavor besides toast and butter. I tried to drown it with syrup, but it didn't improve the taste at all. Had the toast been a side and not my main, I might have excused this oddity.  This was my first time leaving a restaurant still hungry and with the taste of buttered toast on my tongue.  Drew's is a hometown favorite and I know I'll go back... but I'll take my time.",

    "text": "Better than average diner food for almost fine dining prices.  Two adults and one child dining and the total was almost $50.  We had pork schnitzel and a steak salad.  The pork was good, if a little dry.  The salad that accompanies it was generous and topped with two whole slices of bacon. The steak salad was a bit of a disappointment,  it was definitely a large portion but almost half of the bulk was made of giant chunks of kale. No one wants that much raw kale.  The kids chicken fingers looked homemade and were definitely made from real, not processed chicken.   The desserts were impressive to look at but for $6.50 for a slice of cake it better be at least pretty good.   I'd try this place again, but wont order the same things.",

We came here for brunch on Labor Day and were seated in a cute and mini booth (perfect for me!). I was thinking about the Italian frittata, but ordered a waffle and sausage links instead (nothing special, but satisfied my breakfast food craving). Boyfriend ordered steak and eggs, which he enjoyed (even though the steak wasn't made the way he wanted). We also ordered a side of home fries that were kind of bland; wish they added some seasoning and made them crispier. Luckily some salt & pepper on the table helped. Prices were pretty standard for a diner. The people at the table next to us had bagel and lox that looked good, so we might try that if we come back.

We decided to move to another table and I explained it to another waitress as everyone kind of looked at us like umm are you nuts. She told the manager and his reply to her was this, \"it's not poop it's Romano cheese\".",

He ordered eggs Benedict with coffee and a side of hashbrowns.   We had a short wait but were seated in a side room at a table for two. My husband felt it was the best diner he has been to. The portions were extremely well for the price and the wait staff was extreme friendly and attentive. The food took about five minutes to arrive and it was hot to the taste. My cheese and onion omelette was humongous and I didn't even have room to start digging into the home fries before I was full. We also got an app of breaded mushrooms, which came with this AMAZING horseradish sauce. Our total bill came to less than $30.   The second time we went here I ordered a small salad (which was enough for 2 people) and my husband got an omelette (with home fries and toast). Both were absolutely delicious and the ingredients in the salad tastes really fresh. This is easily the best diner in Pittsburgh. BYOB for dinner with no corkage fee. Can't wait to go back.",
