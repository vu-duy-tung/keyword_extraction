    "text": "Ahh, the Squirrel Cage. Many a shameful evening has started here. This used to be my neighborhood bar and thus I have some ingrained loyalty...but beyond that the drinks are cheap, the bartenders are friendly, and it kind of has that Cheers feeling (everyone knows your name). If you want anonymity and live in the Squirrel Hill area, don't come here. You will run into everyone and their mother and its not a place for a quiet drink. The guy at the next bar-stool will talk to you or the table next to you will invite you to join them on a Ritters trip. Not much of a pick-up bar (thankfully) but just a really friendly place. Squirrel Cage is definitely not for the snobby or standoffish, but if you want to meet some locals and are up for joining strangers on an adventure, head over and grab a seat at the bar.",

So when one of his students suggested that I check it out with him at 1AM, my answer was quick and predictable. :)  When we got there, the place had a very nice energy for 1AM. Like someone else said - divey, but not divey in the \"I hope that guy doesn't come over here\" way. No, more divey in the \"Hey, this waitress actually seems kind of cool without being a hipster douche\" way. (Yes, I know that's her job, but it's nice to see people doing their job well.)  We came there to have one drink, but wound up having more - and ordering more than you expected is nearly always a good sign. We had something that billed itself as \"The Official State Beer of China\", which tasted suspiciously like apple juice but at $2 a bottle left us with no complaints. All in all, I approve. It seemed they had very few drinks on tap - so I'll hold off on the the fifth star until I check out their full fridge selection and/or try their food - but for now, it seems like a nice \"standby\" for a weekday drink.",

I'm not a smoker, so when I go out I at least like to know what I'm getting into (and realizing that my clothes will be unwearable the next day). However, this place is a hole in the wall on Forbes in Squirrel Hill, and it's a great place to grab some friends, grab a booth, and grab a pitcher or two for a night. I'm not sure if they still do this, but they use to have board game nights where a different game is placed at each booth.  Board games + beer = perfect night of fun. I've had some good bar food there as well, and from I remember it's not too pricey. There is a great selection of bottled beer, and a pretty average tab variety. I do remember the service not being incredible, but as long as you're with your peeps and do pitchers, you'll be happy. The wood booths and tables give the bar a homey, smokey feel. There is also an upstairs that is open from time to time if the place gets crazy. I've had trouble before finding a booth open on a Saturday night.",

Overpriced bar food that is pretending to be some sort of cuisine? If so, you know where to find them. If not, try the Squirrel Cage.  It's the kind of place where, depending on the day of the week and the time of evening, you can show up with a pack of cards and a group of friends and chill.  Or you can come a little later and enjoy a slightly louder, more crowded atmosphere.  The beers are good, and cheap. The food is cheap. Period. On second thought, an order of lousy onion rings never hurt anyone. But \"Cafe\" is maybe a misnomer.  It'd be nice if Uncle Sam's stayed open later and you could bring your sandwich and/or fries here. How brilliant would that be for (oh, rare pleasure!) late night eats in Squirrel Hill?",

The guy that cooks in the evenings always cooks the burger perfectly. I had one during the daytime once and it was a little overcooked but still delicious. Highly recommend this place. The only downfall is the smoking and that I have to immediately wash my clothes after leaving.",

    "text": "Phenomenal. The alcohol--reasonably priced--and the food--even cheaper--which is amazing. Great hole in the wall. I cannot stress enough, even if you don't drink, then go buy some food because it tastes amazing and the prices are easily the cheapest you will EVER find in Pittsburgh. The spinach artichoke dip is homemade, which is the first time in my life I have ever seen a restaurant not just buy industrial dip. Ask for toasted bread with the spinach artichoke dip for a real treat! Recommendations: 1) cheese burger; 2) spicy hot cheese balls :); and 3) spinach artichoke dip. Beware though--I think the kitchen closes at 10 or 11 so place your orders early! The also have a super wide selection of bottled beers to choose from in addition what they have on tap. If you dread the smell of smoke, do not go here. It is a very smokey place at night. During the day, they have the vents on so there is no smoke smell. Also, do not go here if you expect to leave quickly. The service is really slow because the bar does not have enough waitresses. But who cares if you are out with friends casually.",

I started to frequent this place a few years ago when I was living in the neighborhood and taking the summer to goof off and do very little more than eat and drink my way around Pittsburgh. The Squirrel Hill Cafe helped me do that on the reg. We actually called it the Squirrel Cage-- it throws me off to call it a cafe. I am reading that this place is becoming quite the hip spot, and I don't know how to feel about that, but I am sure it's integrity is still there.  When it was my spot, it was sometimes dark and a little on the empty side, but I found a lot of entertainment watching the guy come out of the kitchen and smoke while he complained about bunions and whatnot.  Every once in a while the place will go off and there will be mostly standing room, and the vibe was always good. I hope they stay cool.",

I got the steak salad and the fried egg sandwich. Both were phenomenal and huge! The fries are soooo good. My boyfriend got the steak hoagie and loved it. (He didn't even let me try any!) I ended up taking the entire egg sandwich home for breakfast the next day because I was stuffed from my salad. We liked the environment, lots of people there of all ages 21+. Its cozy and we were comfortable on the wooden benches. We also had enough privacy. The only problem was the smoke; the ventilator didn't do much for the smell. If you don't mind smoke, and you like small, cozy bars with good beer and cheap food, then def give this place a try!",

They sell decent priced pitchers and broadcast the games. It does get incredibly packed at times.   A solid neighborhood bar where you can sit at the jukebox and pick the tunes you feel like head bopping to. I always end up putting something on like MGMT or Florence and the Machine, I get weird looks when a soulful jazzy soprano starts belting into the room. I'm usually in my own world at that point but you have to love those \"you can find any song you can think of music machines\"  I sure do!  I like pulling up to the bar next to a young college bloke and ordering two fingers of bourbon neat, that's always an eye opener from the Punky Brewster girl with the mouse voice sitting next to you. The bartenders are attentive and so are the servers when you are sitting at the tables.   There is an upstairs room but the ceiling is crazy low, must just be made for the Shawties! I really like that the booths have such high backs so if you are having an intense conversation you can hide in there!  One last thing, this is a smoking bar so if that bothers you don't visit, your clothes will be reeking by the end of the night! Cheers!",

Even as a non smoker, it certainly does bring a different vibe with it, and sometimes it's welcome one.  Certainly brought back memories.    Cool crowd, good music, and a great selection of beer that you normally don't find at rando dive bars.  Like Young's Double Chocolate, or Sierra Nevada Porter, Great Lakes beers, etc.  The only downside, not a great selection on tap.  One thing I love about my dive bars is the taps.  This place severely lacked.    Other than that, the bottled beer is the only thing that really stuck out, otherwise it's an average to slightly above average dive.",

You walk in and you see a mix of people that would represent different classifications of people you'd see throughout Pittsburgh.  Each booth and table is a different subset of the population.  Every booth and table is an exhibit or cage at a zoo, there for you to observe how each group interacts with one another.  Err, what am I saying?  Maybe I just enjoyed myself so much here that I started spacing out. I mean you do get to see a wide mix of the human race interacting in here, but who cares, they are all there for one thing, to have a good time.    Whether you are sitting at the bar or pick a booth along the wall, the staff are there to make sure you have a libation nearby.  Always able to make a suggestion if you want to try something new.   The music touch has a nice mix of music to fulfill anyone's need to hear tunes. But who needs tunes when you can just sit there and chat the whole night?  I'm still skeptical about going up to the loft area. It looks so small from down below.  Such a nice intimate place to go and grab a beer with friends.

If you're looking for a low-key place to get a drink and a burger and come out smelling like an ashtray, this is it. Yes, you can still smoke here, and every time I have went, there's been a plethora of active smokers. You are gonna stink, but it's worth it.   The menu boasts a surprisingly decent draft list. Last time I grabbed a Victory Hop Devil and thought there was a mistake on the tab--it was such a deal. The burgers and sandwiches all fall around $5. \"How do they do this,\"you ask? I don't ask, because the burgers are some kind of straight up delicious witchcraft.   The whole experience is just a steal across the board. After paying the check, I left like I'd gotten away with something, it's that cheap. But, there is a trade off when it comes to visiting the Squirrel Cage--it's laughably slow. There was one poor overworked server in the entire bar, and the kitchen was backed up to the point that it took a little under an hour for hamburgers. There was some confusion on beers as well. I was served a drink meant for another table.   So with that grain of salt, I implore you to be patient and have a good long visit to the Squirrel Hill Cafe.",

The food is immaculate.  Sausage dip is pretty bomb, but the deep fried pepperoni rolls are the True treasure at this spot.  I'm a fan of the Squirrel cage sandwich (turkey, ham, maybe some other meat but I can't be sure).  Mmm.  Cheap, too.    It's the kind of spot that you can get drunk in, eat, and then continue to drink.  Hell yeah.",

The smoke was so overwhelming due to a lack of windows or fresh air that we planned on eating in but ordered to go because there was no way we could eat in the cloud of smoke.",

It struck me as a diner with a bar in it. The food was mediocre (homemade cheese dip is not cheese you put in salsa and melt in the microwave) and the pepperoni roll, while good, was tiny. Beer selection in bottles was good but the draft selection was limited. The Squirrel Cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place. Character can only get you so far. You need to have a reason to come back and, for me, neither the food or the beer selection was enough.",

Everything I've ever taken from this place I've given back to Pittsburgh, usually on a friends bathroom floor near but not in the toilet.    I don't care to get into details about this place, you'll either love it or you won't. It's an old gem of a place that is pretty much my first stop in the city every single time I go.",

    "text": "When I was a kid growing up in Squirrel Hill, the Cage was a place of mystery for us. Who knew what went on behind those dark windows? It was probably a den of iniquity where things too terrible to talk about went on. You weren't allowed to go in and use the BATHROOM. WHY WEREN'T YOU ALLOWED TO WALK IN OFF THE STREET AND USE THE BATHROOM??? IT MUST BE A TERRIBLE PLACE.  When I went to art high school (this was before they started carding), all the coolest teachers used to drink there, and sometimes we'd come in to talk to them on Friday nights and pretend we were cool and old enough to be sitting in the old wooden booths smoking cigarettes. And then suddenly, we *were* old enough to be in the booths smoking and drinking enormous pitchers of Yuengling (or double old-fashioneds for those of us who still had pretensions towards being literary) and stumble out at the end of the night heading for Eat n' Park and smelling like the inside of a cigarette (though my allergies have gotten a lot worse of late and I'm actually starting to wish you couldn't smoke in here--I am getting old!) This is a good bar to come to on a pre-Christmas December night to hang out with friends you haven't seen in ages, and know that tons of people you know will be drifting in and out as the night goes on. This is a good bar to come to when you don't really know where you want to go on a Friday but you know you want to just relax. This is a good bar for women to not get grossly hit on in. This is a good bar to people-watch in--it's always a crowd of middle-aged drunks, university intellectuals, and other fun neighborhood types hanging around in here. It's not the cleanest bar in the world, nor the friendliest (though the bartender with the ZZ Top beard whose name I can't remember is pretty damn great), but it's just a straightforward place where what you see is what you get.    It's not for everyone. It's definitely for me.   (Also, I hear their burgers are good, but I've never eaten here, lol)",

    "text": "There are no shortage of places to drink in the East End, so I'm not clear on why I would ever return to a place where the bartender treated me like garbage for no apparent reason.  My experience here was a short but admittedly eventful one.  I and a group of co-workers stopped in after hosting a visiting speaker for dinner at Bangkok Balcony right next door.  The downstairs was not super crowded, but there was no table large enough for everyone in our group.  The friendly waitress agreed to open the upstairs for us.  After she brought our round of beers, myself and a colleague realized she hadn't brought us pint glasses for our porters (generally not a beer you want to drink out of a cold bottle).  Rather than waiting for the waitress to come back up, then making her go down and back up the stairs another time, I went downstairs to ask for some glasses at the bar.  First I was just ignored.  For maybe 5 minutes I watched the bartender shoot the shit with some people at the other end of the bar. He was not making drinks or taking orders, just conversing.  Which is fine, except that he looked at me several times and it was obvious I wanted something.  Eventually, someone came out of the kitchen, so I asked this person if he could grab me a couple of pint glasses.  He told me he couldn't, because he's not the bartender, but did go to the other end of the bar to let the bartender know what I wanted.  Several minutes later, the bartender deigned to grace me with his presence.  He began to hand me two pint glasses, then said he needed to see my ID before he could give them to me.  I told him I already had drinks, I just wanted the glasses, and that I'd come downstairs so that the waitress didn't have to make an extra trip.  He said \"No ID? No glasses.\"  Ok, fine.  I'm 35 years old.  I have an ID. I don't look remotely underage, but I can play the bartender-on-a-power-trip game as well as anyone.  So I went upstairs, grabbed my ID, came back down and, after waiting probably another five minutes for him to grace me with his presence again, showed it to him.  Only now he needed *2* IDs, what with there being 2 glasses.  So up the stairs I traipse, back down, and now - I shit you not - now he says \"How many people are up there?  I need to see everyone's IDs.\"  I looked at him in astonishment and said \"I only came down here to save your waitress the trip.  I've now gone up and down the stairs three times.  Everyone up there already has a drink.\"  His reply - seriously - was \"I just can't go serving drinks to complete strangers.\"  I'm sorry, what??  You're a bartender.  It's your JOB to serve drinks to complete strangers.  At this point, I'd had enough. I told him I didn't mind showing an ID, and that I understand people have to do their jobs, but that there was absolutely no reason for him to be a dick about it.  I used those words.  At which point he said, \"Well then you are welcome to leave.\"  So we did.  Our entire group left, and I refused to pay for beers that we didn't get to drink.  The waitress went and talked to the bartender - seeing how upset I was and also seeing that I was not going to give her money for drinks we couldn't actually imbibe.  She came back and told us it was all a misunderstanding and that it was fine if we stayed, that he didn't know that we were her customers, yada yada.  No.  I'm not spending my money in a place that treats people like shit.  While waiting for the bus afterwards, one of my colleagues said that he and another friend had encountered similar hostility from this same bartender before, and had also been \"asked to leave.\"  (I didn't get the bartender's name, but I'm guessing he's the only one working there who looks like he just stepped off the set of Duck Dynasty).  I guess the Squirrel Hill Cafe does such great business that they don't need any more?  This was my first and last visit to this place.  We were very sorry that the waitress had to pay for the bartender's shit attitude, but hopefully it will spur her to say something to him or to management about the fact that he is running off customers.  What an absolute disgrace.",

It's a smoking dive with patient and friendly staff and a wild mix of customers. You might wait a while for service at busy points--it's not a heavily staffed place and the drinks and food are cheap.   Billy the bartender is a staple of the establishment and is well known for his jolly attitude, willingness to light up your smoke, and friendly and generous patronage of local businesses. The old guard of serving staff have always been on top of things even while the bar was busy, and the new staff seems to be merging quite well into the mix. Kudos.   The Cage has always seemed like a sort of social equalizer to me. The patrons all talk to one another and congregate loosely, and it's a good place for casual conversations among friends or whoever is around. Even if you're not a regular, you'll likely see someone you know every time you stop by.   Non-smokers who can't stand smoke--don't bother. Otherwise, it's a really damn cool place. Give it a shot.",

Hot pepper cheese balls with marinara(marinara is must with them), a few garlic wings which were some of the crispest and hottest(temperature) wings we'd ever eaten. Of course we had to try a basket of fries too. They were hot and fresh.  Ah, but the star of the show, the burgers!

But I enjoyed her so much. Unfortunately I did not get her name. She is a beautiful brown skin girl with curly fluffy hair, and comedic sass! LOVED IT! She was so attentive and pleasant. Honestly, she's has got to be one of the best waitresses that I have ever encountered with her vibrant personality and she is so hospitable.   I have not gone into a bar in a while where it felt so at home. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious. I  had the spinach artichoke dip and it was good for bar food. My friends were in love with the burgers.  I cannot wait to get back there and try out more from the menu. WARNING: There is smoking, so if you are intolerant, then it might not be the spot for you., but I don't think it was that bad. Other than that....CHEERS",

When I left the place, my clothes and hair all smelled of smoke. As far as food, their burgers are good but nothing I can really remember and the cheese balls are really good. Drinks are decently priced. Service was a bit slow and even though our waitress was nice, she forgot to give one of our credit cards back until we had to remind her.",

    "text": "Such a cute and intimate place to just grab some food/drinks and chillax. Prices are extremely reasonable and service is efficient. Great for group hangouts!  I'm not much of a drinker so I don't really know about their drink specials, but I am a devoted consumer of food so I'll just get straight to the point! Sandwiches here are amazing and really satisfy that burning hunger. I highly recommend their burgers and load it with mushrooms for an additional quarter. When you get a burger...you get a REAL burger. I don't mean those fake factory patties...I'm talking about a thick chunk of juicy beef sandwiched between soft fluffy buns. Their spinach artichoke dip is quite tasty as well. The one thing I don't really like here is their fries...way way way too greasy to the point where it doesn't even taste like potatoes anymore.",

At least this places has a vent/fan type thing but yea, it's still pretty smoky.   Somehow we snagged a booth on a Saturday night... the double vodka/sodas and Stellas flowed seamlessly for the rest of the evening and our bill was only $40 bucks! The kitchen closed right when we decided we wanted food, so that sucked. But I'm glad I didn't read the reviews about how good the food is prior to or we'd have been really bummed. But then again, I watched the cook chain smoke cigs all night long so... gross.   I read someone describe the atmosphere as jovial and that it was. Every table was laughing and having a great time, as was I. Out waitress was super pleasant and funny as well!   This is definitely my kind of dive bar. Although, I greatly dislike single restrooms... but I got lucky in that the line was never too long.",

    "text": "What can I say about The Cage that others haven't already said, based on my lone visit last night at 6?  I don't know, but for the sake of brevity, I'll sum up my visit with a pro-con list.  Pros: 1. Cheap, decent food.  My BLT ($4.25) was delightful, with crispy, juicy bacon and crisp, fresh lettuce--only the hothouse tomatoes disappointed.  Get the fries--they're hand-cut and delicious!  I tried some from a companion, and regretted not upgrading to a platter to get them.  2. I can't comment on the drinks myself, since I'm not drinking at present, but everyone says they're good--and they're cheap, too.  I got a club soda ($1.25).  3. Interesting people watching opportunities.  I wasn't able to take advantage of them due to concentrating on group discussion with my table mates, but the bits and pieces that I saw and overheard were amusing.  Cons: 1. Smoky.  If you're sensitive to cigarette smoke, don't come here!  When I first entered, I thought I might be okay with it, but then the table next to ours started smoking.  I could smell smoke on myself for the rest of the night until I changed and showered.  2. Slow service.  Our waitress wasn't the swiftest or the most friendly, and it took 20 min. to get my BLT.  Getting change took way too long, too.  3. $10 credit card minimum. I suspected this would be the case, so I hit the ATM next door before coming.  Plan accordingly.  Quite honestly, though I enjoyed the food and company, I doubt I'll be back here soon due to the smoke.  Increasing my risk for lung cancer and reeking of eau de cigarette isn't my idea of a fun, relaxing night out.  If you don't mind that and the slow service, though, then by all means, stop by for some inexpensive, delicious food and drinks and take advantage of the interesting people watching opportunities.",

    "text": "In a neighborhood as historic as Squirrel Hill, 'The Cage' (as locals know it) has existed as a similarly stalwart institution.  Famous for its large portions of food, wide selection of beers, and inexpensive prices, it's been the neighborhood's signature haunt for decades.  In a critical light, the food is simple pub affair, and the quality does not hold a distinct edge to other bars' offerings of the same items. But that's not really the point of The Cage. It's more about the function it serves. The meeting of the locals. The neighborhood funnel. Squirrel Hill is known for its varied population, and this establishment has always been a focal point for its gathering.  I'll drink to that.",

    "text": "I come here often, usually around happy hour, and occasionally late night.   Most of the time, the food is really good. I especially like the grilled chicken salad (good deal), the jumbo fish (battered, as opposed to the breaded \"extra large\" they offer, and so infinitely better), and Cage club (capicola, turkey, cheese, delicious). However, the prices have risen from unfathomably dirt cheap to only pretty cheap. Be aware that you will pay extra for fries instead of chips, and that the fries are sometimes so overcooked that any potato inside has turned to dust. Wings are real good, but only the most basic sauces. Every once in a while, your food will just not be that good. Can't find a rhyme or reason to it, but it's good often enough that I keep coming back, and never so bad that it's awful. Just not as good as normal.  As far as drinks go, the Yuengling pitcher is an economical and delicious choice. I can never remember when or what the specials are, but they often have out-of-season seasonals in the bottle case for real, real cheap. It's worth asking.   And once it's late and your drunk, there is nothing like their Long Island to take you to new and undiscovered levels of intoxication.",

I love the fries and the fried mushrooms. The cheese balls didn't stand the test, but that's probably just because I'm from Wisconsin.  The drinks are cheap and well made. I've enjoyed everything I've ordered there and they have a pretty good beer selection.  The atmosphere is nice. It's comfortable, a bit dark, and it's loud, but not overly so. You can still have a conversation at your table.   I'll be back - but only on nights when I have time to take a shower before bed.",

    "text": "Psst... Over here: despite being a bar, not a cafe, and technically not even a restaurant, this packed little dive bar has one of the best, and almost certainly cheapest burgers in town.  The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is jovial.  The bartenders are real Pittsburgh characters.  That said, I'd never have come in here, except it's a smoker's paradise, and while I don't smoke, I have friends who do.  Walking into the Squirrel Cage (as it really goes by) is like walking into an ashtray.  Seriously, if you know anyone with asthma, don't bring them here.   The first time I came, I was starving.  A friend told me that I had to try the burger.  Based on the price, I think $3 for the burger and another $2 for fries, I ordered two cheeseburgers.  My friend and everyone around me looked at me like I was crazy.  When the burgers came out, I could see why.  For the price, or even triple as much, these are some big burgers, and additionally, they're delicious.    Apparently, they can't make more than a certain percentage off food without being categorized as a restaurant, at which point they could no longer allow people to smoke, so the burgers, and all other food are essentially loss-leaders.  Despite people's incredulous stares, I polished off both burgers.   If you're a smoker, or a non-smoker who is prepared to remove all of your clothing and put them in a sealed bag immediately after leaving, or just burn them, then this a burger you don't want to miss.",
