It was just a piece of salmon over quoina, peas, and chopped cucumbers. Although it was very tasty, I wish it was properly labeled. This salad was very pricey for what you got. I don't know too many people that will pay $19 for a salad on their lunch break. Atmosphere was superb!",

Although the lower dining room where we sat I felt was really bright and cold. Next time I will ask for a different area.   The trout was great, and we liked the apps we ordered.  The Brassica was interesting and quite tasty. The Tartar was also nice with the sunflower seeds.  The pork chop, unfortunately, was not too great.  Done well, but not much flavor and the beans really clashed.   Overall had a great time and I am sure they will work out the kinks.  I appreciated not a huge menu and the wines were tasty!  Didn't try dessert...that's for next time!",

We started with drinks at the bar, as I had arrived early for our reservation. The gin osterling was delicious and refreshing. After the full party arrived, we were promptly seated. We started with a variety of starters including raw oysters. I had the salmon with a side of onion spatzle,  as I had heard the portions were small. But the side was really not necessary. Everything was served promptly and we were all delighted with the meal. I'm glad the previous mediocre reviews did not prevent me from coming. Plus the space and decor is beautiful.",

The ramp fettuccini was al dente to the point of chewy.  The $12 baby green salad was just ok, nothing great.  Our biggest disappointment was the hosting staff.  The restaurant was not full - even on a Saturday night with the Penguins playing at home.  I asked if we could sit in one of the booths near the front - all three were empty.  The staff informed me that those were already reserved for parties of 5; we were 4 people. We ended up in a very small booth in the bar area.  But as we left, two of the larger booths were occupied with parties of 4, and a party of 4 was JUST being seated in the third --NOT parties of 5.  Hmmm...  When questioned, the manager appeared to be unconcerned and barely appologetic.  BTW - the reservation was made 3 weeks in advance; we arrived at 6:00; our reservation was for 6:30; we were dressed up. So will we return to The Union Standard? I doubt it.  Disappointing experience...  One positive note, our server was attentive and helpful.",

I made the mistake of assuming that the fries came with the sandwich, that's on me for not asking.  The sandwich was good, but did not have a lot of taste to it.  I'm a fan of Eleven's swordfish sandwich so I was a little bit disappointed.  Also, I feel that the lunch was not worth the price.  Over $20 with tip for a fairly modest sized sandwich and a handful of fries.  I don't think I will return for lunch unless someone else is paying, but will bring my wife down for dinner someday on a special occasion.",

Atmosphere: We began by asking to be moved from our original table which was immediately next to the door to being sat at a table immediately next to the restroom. Atmosphere felt generally cold and it wasn't just the draft. Food and Drink: The wine glasses were still damp from their previous rinse before ending up on our table. Seriously? Wine however was reasonably priced across the board. We unfortunately found issues with nearly all the dishes we ordered and I struggled to say something positive about the experience after dinner.  Spinach salad was sopping wet with dressing and egg yolk.  Kumamoto oysters were small and relatively flavorless. These are my favorite oyster and I was disappointed with the quality. Homemade hot sauce and fresh horseradish was a nice touch however.  Beef tartare was average and lacked much flavor. The toast it was served with was cold and damp. Lame.  Scallop appetizer was just OK. Nothing memorable.  Suckling pig entree was under seasoned. Needed sauce and some contrasting texture. Ate half and had enough.  Fries were returned due to over salting and were removed from bill Service: Server was helpful and attentive despite the wine glass mishap.   Maybe things will improve with time but this place is not on the same level as other downtown establishments. I expected more from this chef after enjoying his offerings at Eleven for a number of years.",

Very limited and spotty menu.  I met 2 colleagues there and decided I wanted a sandwich for lunch.  Only 1 sandwich on the menu - butternut squash grilled cheese?  If you are a foodie, that might be attractive, but for the everyday professional who wants a decent place for lunch with a diverse menu, this is NOT the place.  Again, only 1 sandwich on the menu and 2 entree salads.  I had the pot pie since the butternut squash grilled cheese was not appealing.  It was good, but not great.  One of my lunch mates had the salmon and he said it was good but was not a fan of the mixed grain salad with sunflower seeds.  My other lunch mate had the grilled cheese.   She liked it, but said she would probably not order it again.  She wanted a side with it (fries or a salad, etc.) and they tag you for another $3.  It did not even come with a side...just a grilled cheese on a plate.  I will probably go back just because there is nothing else close to our building in town.  All in all, it was ok but not great.",

We had the Union Mule and Promenade and both were fantastic.  Will definitely make a trip back.  The restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected with a nice, clean look.

Assistant staff made service easy and smooth with their attentiveness. Cocktail selection was what it needed to be and the bartenders obviously knew what they were doing. Drinks were great and I didn't have to wait for it. Dinner was fabulous. I had the scallops, they were perfectly seared hard and butter in the middle. The dish completely came together with the beets, pork belly, and the fresh apple. I would have a hard time not ordering that dish again, except I wouldn't because I would want to try another dish from this chef. Also started with a very unique and beautiful salad with pork croutons and a poached egg. We brought our own cake because we were celebrating a birthday and they took very good care of it all. Check was presently properly and taken care of efficiently and we received a genuine thank you and send off... it was flawless. Not to mention they accommodated a party of 8 for us with short notice from the start. Couldn't find a flaw if I tried. Thank you.",

    "text": "I was disappointed by the Scramble when my husband and I visited Union Standard yesterday for Father's Day. It sounded great with kale and mushrooms. However, the shoestring potatoes that I expected would be like skinny fries on the side were piled on the top and were like the ones that used to come in a can to be strewn on top on a canned soup casserole. At least they were easy to scrape off the eggs.I also expected the cream cheese to be mixed into the scrambled eggs to make them creamy, but it was just big hunks of cream cheese underneath the eggs, kale and mushrooms. The dish was not served with toast or other bread to spread the cheese on, there was no bread service before the entree was served, nor was toast or English muffin offered as a side so a diner is just left to eat hunks of cream cheese--not something that I found at all appetizing. I might be willing to try their dinner menu but I don't think I would return for brunch.",

    "text": "This review is a little overdue, but with the holidays, I got distracted.  My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night in early November for my birthday.  The food was absolutely incredible- one of the best meals I have had in a long while.  We started with the potato bread (a must have!).  It comes with three different butter spreads to put on it.   I wish our waiter pointed out which butter was which, but it was not anything we couldn't figure out by tasting it.  My husband and I contemplated ordering a second \"loaf\" of the bread, but held back in order to save room at the end of the meal for dessert.  My husband also ordered the steak tartare.  Although I didn't personally try it, my husband said that it was the best tartare he's ever had.    For an entree, my husband ordered the sea scallops and I ordered the strip steak.  The steak was amazing - a perfect medium rare!  I thought the dish was large enough to share.  My husband had some of the steak and I still had enough left over to make a sandwich the next day.  The chimichurri and mashed fingerling potatoes complimented the steak well.   My husband's scallops were also cooked perfectly.  I wish we had left over some of the potato bread to soak up the broth that came with the scallop dish.    For dessert we ordered the vanilla dutch baby, which came recommended by our waiter.  Dessert was good, but definitely the weakest part of the meal.  I wish the apples were cooked down, instead of being raw.  I think it would have added an additional depth of flavor and warmth to the dish.    There are a lot of elements of Union that are similar to Eleven (which makes sense because the chef/owner is the former chef of Eleven).  All leftovers are packaged and left at the coat check for when you leave.  It's a nice touch that helps avoid leaving leftovers on the table.  Te overall decor is modern, but the fabrics and colors used in the space made it feel warm and comfortable.  Our bill came to about $130, which included 3 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert.  It was a lot lower than I expected, but still high enough to save this place for a more special occasion.  I will definitely be back again, but plan to try out their happy hour soon.  The happy hour is half off oysters and burgers, and based on how well the meals were executed at our dinner, I'm sure the happy hour will surpass my expectations.",

    "text": "The only reason I had given Union Standard a 3 is because I had been here once before and it was phenomenal. The pricing didn't bother me because the service blew me away. I had my girl friends visiting from out of town and our server brought us an entire cake with candles and said, \"I know it's nobody's birthday, but sometimes you just have to celebrate good friends getting together\". Amazing! I work in Guest Services at a Pittsburgh hotel and have reccomended this restaurant to guests ever since. I am so sorry to say that I won't be doing that anymore. Last night my mother and I dined there with my boyfriend's family and I was so insanely disapointed, and felt embarassed as I have been talking about this place so highly. Working in GS I know how important experience is--and our server failed to provide this for us. She did not introduce herself, took a very long time in between stops at the table, and not once asked if we would like another beer/wine (let us run up our tab, please!). We all tried several times to try to connect with her on a personal level, with no luck. The food was fine. Not as great as I remembered, and the price stung a little this time. Overall the dining experience was cold and bland compared to the amazing experience I had last time. For that, I can no longer confidently send my guests here. Ensuring an exceptional customer experience is imperative, and I can't risk that.",

We expected a nice, relaxing dinner, where we had time to reminisce and catch up.  The only thing that bothered me about our experience there was that we felt totally rushed.  The restaurant was not even close to full.  Our waitress wanted us to order everything right away and there was just this nagging feeling that we had to rush.  As my mother taught me, dinner should be an experience and not just a meal.  I wish I could say that this was the case.  With that said, the food was exceptional!  Everything that I tried was first rate, from the oysters with caviar, to the prawns, every bite was magnificent.  I think this is a top-tier restaurant with great potential, but the wait staff needs stronger management.",

However my adult son heard it was fabulous so we decided to ignore those reviews and check it out for ourselves. We were really glad that we did. We started out with a nice selection of oysters but at three dollars apiece we only shared three each. I could've crushed two dozen by myself. It was very fresh and sweet and I didn't even add any toppings. We also shared a shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were large and cooked perfectly, Nice and firm. We also enjoyed the calamari very much. The cauliflower gratin made a nice Side dish with our meals and was enough to share. For the main course I went with the lamb shank which was quite similar to an osa bucco and was delicious. My wife opted for the scallops and really enjoyed them. For her the highlight of the meal was the walnut pie which she raved about.   I was a little surprised about the decor because Other reviewer's that had posted about the classic building it is in. My expectation was that The restaurant would've been more old-fashioned but it turned out it was very contemporary. Nevertheless it was warm and inviting.

    "text": "In my check-in I said Union Standard set the standard. It did...below standard. The building in which it is housed is historic and stunning. It drops off sharp after that. The decor in the restaurant has that industrial cafeteria/assisted living commissary feel. Multiple levels of dun colored boxes as charming as a used car lot in Jasper, Texas. There was a long bar with  sleepy staff and a raw bar with sleepy oysters.      On Thursday night at peak dinner time it was empty and that should've been a sign. The menu was limited, but actually it was the kitchen that was limited.   The Vibe: Who goes there? Apparently, almost no one. A few stray office hoppies and tourists who read and trusted the current Eater Top 10. Eater will need a good talking to.   The Bar Program: There was a list of house cocktails with indecipherable ingredients that defied a google search. (Bluecoat, Dolin Blanc, Salers...sounded like a home remedy for a Thrush infection.) Have a draft.   The Staff: Well, she tried. (She tried my nerves.) \"You have to have the Chicken. It's the most amazing thing you will ever eat,\" she implored. My bud gave in and ordered the Chicken. \"I am so thrilled and excited you ordered the Chicken!\" she gushed with a straight face. The poor thing was actually breathless and quivering. Save the candy and flowers with that one and just buy her a chicken and hope for the best. Alas, the Chicken was \"86\" by 7:30 PM. The chicken had crossed the road before we got there.    \"I'll have the Steak Tartar to start please.\" To start what? A fire? It was a tasteless cylinder of meat mush (useful in getting the charcoal going in the chimney perhaps). A piece of cold stale bread grilled once in it's life was on the plate along with potato chips I could bend in half without breaking. The steak was a compressed disk of sawdust topped with Sunflower Seeds, Sprouts, Pickled Garlic, with Deviled egg Dressing, none or which belongs in this dish. Or maybe they all do in this version.      I'll just have some warm Potato Bread and Butter with my warm beer. Alas, the bread was cold and as soft as dust bunnies.   The Brussels Sprouts, Castlefranco and Bibb Salad with Boiled Miso Dressing. Roasted Garlic Croutons, Hidden Hills Dairy Allegheny (cheese, I think) came next masquerading as a salad.   It was all shredded beyond recognition. If you like eating green dental floss...dig in. I think a Brussells Sprout had been rolled around and over the mess before service and then reserved for something else.    So far the food was fit for a King. Now where did that German Shepherd get to?    The Grilled Lauren Bay Calamari under under-braised Escarole, canned White Beans, and a charred Lemon was forgettable.The Escarole had sand in it to make the squid feel at home? The Escarole must have been washed with a squirt gun at 10 paces.   Next came the Whole Wheat Fettuccine with Serenity Hills Farm Lamb (the lamb must have had followed the Chicken across the road because it was MIA), Peas, Kale, Chive Butter, Maitake, and Goat Rodeo Stampede (this must have been cheese). It's okay to use stinky cheese but not cheese that stinks. At best it was astringent and had an Ammonia finish. It tasted like a goat's groin after you chased it uphill all day. (Please don't ask how I know what that tastes like.) The Gorilla Glue Sauce couldn't hide it and it too was horrid on it's own. Okay, this glop of cement had been left in the pot for the starch to congeal. Stick a fork in it and the whole tangle came up together in one chewy lump. Inedible.That was a rookie's mistake. Leave the cooked pasta sit for an hour and voila this is what you get. Why not cook it al dente, and quickly mix it with pasta water and a tasty sauce that will stay down? Maybe just get more hours on your day job and throw in the towel cooking here at night?   The French Fries (an impulse buy) were as limp as a sleeping puppy's feet. The soggy pile came with Marrownaise adding no taste and plenty of calories.   The manager listened to our complaints patiently and without disagreement, I might add, and offered two comped desserts. The Ice Cream Sandwich was Maple Oat Ice Cream that tasted like neither of those ingredients. There were some diagonals of bananas (big deal), and two Coconut Macaroons. Aren't those supposed to be soft, moist and chewy? One dropped on a plate and cracked it. The other fought off the point of a steak knife previously employed to deal with the pasta. A vice and a chain saw may not have worked. Enjoy snacking on a cue ball? Order this.   The Chocolate Dutch Baby came with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Marshmallows (not needed or adding anything to the dish) and Chocolate Sauce (probably store bought) and renamed Ganache and a few soft candied Pecans. In all fairness it was actually manageable, but if you give a typewriter to an infinite number of monkeys eventually you will get Hamlet.   Union Standard is closer to American Standard.",

The ricotta toast was quite good. The bitter blood orange atop of the ricotta was perfect. The honey and pistachio made for a great finish.   The Chicken Hash, however, was a mushy mess. There was too much water from the poached farm egg in the dish when served. The potatoes were way over cooked to a mashed consistency and about half of the chicken was shredded while the rest was cubed. The water, potatoes, and semi-shredded chicken made for a odd paste like consistency that I just could not eat. The only thing left was the egg and chicharrones which were fine.",

    "text": "I have recently returned to Union Standard for lunch with my family. Previously, I only went to happy hour, where the drink options did not color me entirely impressed. This time around, as I sat down for lunch with my family, I ordered the baked pesto rigatoni, while my family ordered options such as the halibut and burger. The service was good, albeit not as attentive as I expected as the water was not filled very often.   When my meal arrived, it was quite beautiful. The pasta was a beautiful kelly green color and a side salad made my plate burst with hues of green. The flavor, however, did not live up to its appearance. The sauce was oily and did not stick to the rigatoni. I suggest a noodle like angel hair or fusilli that can hold onto the sauce better than the large rigatoni. The vegetable mix inside the pesto bake was interesting as well. It featured potatoes, which I would not think to put in pasta, but it soaked up the pesto nicely. The ramps and cheese melted on top were my favorite parts of it, since the ramps wilted in the sauce, giving it a creamed spinach feel. The side salad was also delicious and featured a light dressing that did not mask the crunch or flavor of the greens.   My family seemed much more impressed by their meals. I have a feeling that this restaurant is better known for their meat options. Nonetheless, impressive menu and good service. A nice place to go for lunch with coworkers during the week.",

Had to flag down a waitress (1) who took our order. Then a very grumpy waitress (2) came over and rudely asked if we knew what we wanted. I told her that we had already ordered she demanded to know what we had ordered when a bartender (3) and waiter (4) stepped in and told her it was taken care of. Napkins and cutlery were dropped (by waiter 1) We could see the staff in a frenzy. Even saw staff fighting in the corner. We received our drinks then dinner (5) Dinner was flavorful. No one ever came by with water or to ask if we needed anything. We had time for a 2nd drink so as we finished we flagged down for another round and the bill. The bartender poured it and it sat for 12 minutes waiting for someone to pick it up and walk it 3 feet to us. I eventually had to tell bartender it was our drinks. At this point we needed to rush through and pay to get to the concert.  Waitress 1 asked as we were leaving how things were and and took opportunity to vent. I have never had a dining experience when all the staff were so unhappy. At least 5 people had contact with us, only 1 was trying to help and clearly sitting  at the bar we were not her station. As I said we heard staff yelling, no eye contact, no checking in customers, running around like chickens without heads and we will never  go back. It was a $101 night and we should have chosen another spot.",

We went for brunch this past Sunday and it was not the least bit crowded.  The service was on the slower side but overall it was fine for our group of 6. The brunch menu was pretty limited with mostly lunch foods and appetizers. I went with the melted leek and goat cheese omelet which came with fingerling potatoes and a citrus salad.  It was all very tasty and a hearty portion. The citrus salad was especially good with orange and grapefruit slices topped with basil.  Everyone else in our party was pleased with their orders including the oatmeal bowl and the salmon dish. The prices were pretty reasonable and it was a comfy yet chic atmosphere.",

My aunt and I had a reservation on a weekday and were seated immediately at a comfortable little table upstairs, but that's the only truly positive comment I have about Union Standard. Service was very slow and it took 15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order. We both ordered a glass of wine. The restaurant wasn't busy, yet it was another 15 minutes before the drinks made it to the table. Strike one. I will say the wine I selected (a syrah by the glass) was quite good once I finally had it in front of me to taste. We ordered stone crabs for an appetizer and they were dinky, not super fresh and served without the appropriate tools (fork + shell cracker). After what seems like forever, I received my main course (salmon) and it was okay, but not spectacular. The fish was cooked perfectly, but it had minimal flavor and the side portion was so small (about 1-2 TBSP of butternut squash micro cubes) that I felt hungry (salmon was about 6 oz). My aunt had tartare and said it was just okay. We both love Eleven, so we were expecting great things from Chef Derek's new baby, Union Standard, but it's almost as if he left Eleven and forgot how to cook. The restaurant does not validate or discount parking in the semi-attached garage. I won't return to Union Standard since there are so many better options at that price point in the city.     TL;DR: Cool space, bad service, unexceptional food.",

    "text": "I took the fiancee here for her birthday because she loves raw oysters.  We will definitely be going back.  Everything about this place emanated a fresh perspective on Pittsburgh dining downtown.  Each dish was unique and extremely tasty.  Our server was Timothy F and was great.  He was fast, efficient, knowledgable and not full of BS that you sometimes get with higher end dining.  He even accommodated my birthday request (see dessert section).  We started with drinks.  She had the Rum Arcade and I had a dirty Ketal One martini, up.  Both drinks were outstanding and the bartender knows what they are doing.  The Rum Arcade is on the sweet side FYI.  Next she sampled two of each of their raw oyster offerings.  She had 3 from the East Coast and one from California.  The best ones were the Windmill Points from VA.  She said the texture and flavor was simply awesome.  The two from New York were not as good which surprised me because she always likes Blue Points...  The other standout was from CA and neither of us can remember the name!  I want to say it was Choco Point...but thanks to the stiff drinks we both forget.  The CA oysters were unique with great flavor.  She said they were like little balls, similar to a cooked mussel.  5/5  For sharing we got the Skillet Baked Blue Crab.  Simply amazing.  The amount of lump crab was perfect and the flavors changed as we ate it.  The crostinis were delicious but seemed to explode when we bit into them.  The trick is to let them sit for 30 seconds so they absorb some moisture.  5/5  For appetizers she got the Sea Scallops and I got the Smoked Potato & Goat Cheese Soup.  The (2) scallops were 2.25\" across but cooked perfectly.  The chef knows what they are doing because they were tender, juicy and still had a perfect burnt crust.  I just wish there were 4 of these so I could have had another.  :-)  5/5  The Smoked Potato & Goat Cheese Soup was great.  It was thin for potato soup but still creamy.  I would have liked a little more goat cheese because that really made the soup.  4/5  Her main course was the Skuna Bay Salmon cooked medium.  It was a True medium with slightly raw in the middle so be forewarned, you do not have to order a level down if you want some red in the center.  She said it was delicious but didn't understand the pairing of the beans.  While everything was good she thought it would be better with a pasta or rice.  I ordered the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb.  It was outstanding and cooked perfectly.  5/5  For dessert she had the Blood Orange Upside-down Cake and I had the German Chocolate Doughnut.  Since it was her birthday I asked them to do something special for her dessert and they threw a candle in the ice cream.  This was perfect since we tackle anyone (ask our server about that one...) that tries to sing Happy Birthday.  She said her dessert was great but I know it was not as good as mine.  The German Chocolate Doughnut was fricking awesome.  I almost finished it and will order it again.  The salted caramel, cream...some kind of brittle.  It was just awesome and you should order it.  We highly recommend this place and will be going back.  $180",

Every experience has been the same- food is delicious and bartenders/wait staff are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. They also have specialty cocktails that really knock it out of the park- I have yet to try one I don't like. Food wise, their Brussel sprout salad is so yummy- and the asparagus soup (which has since been replaced with carrot) was heavenly. The oyster accompaniments are also to die for- the perfect finishing note to the fresh shucked oysters. The only negative about this establishment is that I do feel it's a bit pricey for the amount of food given. I will continue to splurge for lunch every once in awhile though, as the menu seems to rotate and I really like trying the new flavor combinations.",

    "text": "First few moments were not good. Hostess stared at her screen utterly perplexed for a good five minutes after confirming we had a reservation, then finally determined what she needed to do next. Seated at what could possibly be the worst two-top in the house (right next to where all the servers are waiting for the their orders to come up, at the top of the stairs on the way to the restrooms), watered, and then...crickets. We sat for close to 15 minutes without being acknowledged by any server even tho literally six servers were standing next to our table at all times. We managed to flag down a hostess who found our server, who apologized very nicely and said he was negotiating with the kitchen for a GF diner at another table. He actually ended up being a fantastic server so all was forgiven there. Cocktails were skimpy (once you pulled the giant olives out of the martini there were three sips in the coupe), so we switched to a bottle of wine instead, which was a good selection from a nice but short list. Apps - husband said the tartare was \"soft\", whatever that means. The oyster and clam stew was delightful but TINY - I realize it's an app but it was still really little. Entrees - his pork chop was good and my burger was good but it was overcooked and needed some acidity - sweet onion, sweet pickle, and lots of fat need something to cut them a bit. A nice dill pickle or some mustard would have been welcome. Onion rings were crisp but kind of bland. The miso sauce was great. The dessert menu, to me, was a complete miss, so we walked over to the Commoner and had sticky toffee pudding. All told. the food was good but I expected more from Derek Stevens. The place is incredibly loud (and it might be better on a weeknight because it was packed) so this is not a romantic restaurant or someplace I'd recommend if you want to have an quiet conversation. The parking situation is weird (take a ticket, garage door opens, and there's a valet inside, then you have to walk back outside to the restaurant), and the walk from the garage to the restaurant includes being treated to the smell of rotting fish (not sure if there's a garbage chute or what, but not appetizing). All in all, I won't put US on our regular rotation but if a friend wanted to go there I wouldn't protest.",

I went with a friend for Friday night cocktails and a few apps, hoping to check out the new establishment.  We quickly found two seats at the bar, and settled in.  It felt a little trendy, a little industrial, but overall a great comfortable bar that I imagine was probably very crowded a few hours before we arrived.  The bartender was upbeat and lovely, and she handed us several menus, food, drinks, cocktails etc. I went with the Pinkerton  and loved it!  I'm a sucker for herbs in my drinks, so the sage and pepper was delightful.  My friend went with a glass of pinot gris and pour was generous.  I would definitely go back for drinks.  My friend is a vegetarian, and I will say that the options were pretty limited. We went with the kholrabi app and split the squash entree.  We skipped on the potato bread, but next time I think we'd add that onto the order as well.  All of our food was decent, but a little on the bland side.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some other menu items, specifically the oysters, but as for vegeterian-friendly food, I'm not sure this would be my go-to spot.  Overall it was a great happy hour, business casual, cocktail spot and a nice addition to the downtown bar scene.",

The crab dip is delicious - buttery, creamy and full of big chunks of crab - and we finished every morsel; but the star of the show is the clams.  The broth made with Arsenal cider is rich, just the right amount of seasoning, enhanced with bacon and leeks, mustard, lemon...crispy croutons that soak up the broth and perfectly steamed clams.

The skillet that the rigatoni was served in was straight out of the oven and made my food too hot to eat quickly. I had to dump it out and into the room temperature plate to be able to eat in my time frame. Also, the white cloth napkins left white fuzz on the black pants of myself and everyone I ate with. Also, realize that if you take the waiter up on sparkling water, you will be charged for it.",

    "text": "Went to Union Standard on Friday night. Overall it was an underwhelming experience all around.  Remodel was impressive, nice space, and the atmosphere in other parts of the dining room looked nice. However we were sat by the door under some bright lights, which at 10pm was off-putting.  Wine was unremarkable, cocktail (Union Mule) was fine.  Oysters were great, super fresh, Would go back just for these.   Ribeye was good. Cooked nicely, but the burnt brassica on top wasn't a great side. For $42, wasn't worth it.  Trout was bland, full of bones, and sitting in a bland potato soup. I had a few bites but after I got a few bones, and started looking at how many more bones remained, I was done with that dish. I left most of this soggy meal in the bowl, and waiter did not inquire how it was, or if I wanted it wrapped up.   Manager was horsing around with acquaintances and hostess, did not inquire how any tables were doing, but did ask us how it was when we were getting our coats to leave. When I said that it wasn't great and why...he stood there motionless, and sheepishly said he hoped it was better next time. Maybe it will be better in a few months, but at $150 with tip, I'm not going to go back anytime soon.   We live downtown and it's great that restaurants continue to open, but I will be excited when this trend of overly complicated, and (in this case) poorly executed food is over. Even if you have a great space, cool menus and uniforms, if you're not meat and potatoes / butcher and the rye, don't pretend to be.",

    "text": "Located in what will soon be the Distrikt Hotel, the Union Standard is in a beautiful space on William Penn Place in downtown Pittsburgh. The drink list is quite varied and the Martinez I ordered was spot on. The menu is small with a focus on seafood. I was disappointed that they did not offer the raw bar menu to us even though we were seated at a table in the restaurant. We ordered the crab dip to start and it was probably my favorite dish of the night. The roasted potato and goat cheese soup was delicious with just the right amount of goat cheese. I ended up ordering clams steamed in cider and while they had a great flavor, they were just way too salty. My boyfriend ordered the burger requesting medium rare, however it was cooked well done. It's probably best to stick with the seafood options. The staff are all very accommodating and friendly which is a huge plus!  Not sure that I will be back but I am glad that I was able to try a new place in downtown. Overall, I think Union Standard will do well for the downtown crowd.",

A lot of the building was vacant for a long time, so to see this amazing restaurant take shape has been really great! Definitely start off your meal with their warm bread, it's perfection.

Crossing the threshold I was amazed by the refined style of the building, and was promptly greeted by the charming and attentive staff at the host stand. My partner and I decided to enjoy our meal at the bar, which I was excited to see so busy at only 5:30!! A great sign for things to come.  One of the bartenders, Sam, a tall handsome brunette in glasses cleared a space for my partner and I, and flashed a knowing smile at us as he flawlessly prepared our cocktails. I thought to myself, \"This man knows what he's doing. He's so charming and confident, I'm in good hands tonight.\" The drinks themselves were perfectly balanced and the perfect way to start our meal. And the meal!!! We began with the baked blue crab, it came sizzling in the cutest aquamarine  baking dish, with an illuminating side of house made potato toast. For someone who doesn't eat much seafood, I was utterly taken aback by the creamy textures and the oceanic mascarpone. The Strip Steak was next, and I was suddenly escorted back in time, to a cool summer night, fireflies dancing to the cricket's cadence, my father humming under his mustache while he worked the grill.  5 Stars and a sincere congratulations to the wonderful hard-working folks at the Union Standard. Opening a restaurant in the current climate of this city is almost impossible, but I feel confident that this revelatory new addition will quickly find itself a staple, and will continue to delight the senses for many years to come.",

Something about the decor lacked personality - even the mural. Overall it has a clean, sleek appearance, but certain things felt chintzy and lifeless.  Drinks: I was a little disappointed by their cocktail list, so I ordered off-menu and got a Knob Creek Old Fashioned. It didn't disappoint! Kudos to the bartender.  Food: We started with the potato bread. I didn't find anything dynamite about it. In fact, if it didn't have the accompanying butters/spreads, it probably wouldn't have been eaten by the group. Several of us got the salmon dish. The skin was crispy, but other than that, the fish lacked flavor. At one point in the meal, two of us dining looked up and asked each other: \"are these frozen vegetables?\"  Service: Dutiful, but not overly warm.",

    "text": "Finally, finally, finally, Union Standard is open for lunch!  Hip! Hip! Hooray!   Okay, I have been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for quite some time.  And since I don't live in or near Downtown Pittsburgh, my first forays to new restaurants are usually during lunch time.  (Better to explore a new restaurant at lunch during working hours, than to commit to a long drive, expensive parking and an expensive meal that you may or may not like during dinner hours.)  The restaurant is located on the corner of Oliver and William Penn in the Union Trust building and decorated in a very tailored and no-nonsense way.  No frou-frou, just clean and simple lines on multiple levels.  I liked the decor. (I can see this spot becoming home to frequent power-lunchers.)  Me and one half of the usual dynamic duo (The other usual suspect was out of town this week.) ventured there and were seated immediately. (I made reservations and I suggest that you do the same.)  The hostess was extremely welcoming and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  My crime partner ordered the Elysian Fields Lamb Patty Melt served on rye with bacon, Swiss, roasted sweet onion, caramelized onions and whole grain mustard.  I ordered the Crispy Halibut Sandwich - cornmeal fried and served on potato bread with cabbage & carrot slaw and smoked pepper remoulade.  We also ordered a side of fries which came sprinkled with their house seasoning and pickled red onions. (I've never seen fresh-cut fries served with pickled red onions, but they worked because they cut through the oiliness of the rich foods that we were eating.)  Both of us cut off portions of our sandwiches to share with one another and they were both delicious!  The halibut portion size was extremely decent, as well as the lamb patty. (Note: The fish appeared and tasted like it was breaded with a type of panko instead of cornmeal, but it was still delicious!)  And since I'm not really a ketchup person, our fries were served with a house-made aioli and a dill dressing.  Both sauces were outstanding. (Note: Fries or sides are not served with the sandwiches, but ordered separately.  However, the $5 portion could have easily fed three people if accompanying a sandwich.)  I would just like to make a suggestion that the owners list the potential side dishes on the menu, so you don't have to ask and so that customers know for sure that sides aren't included with the Sandwiches & Mains.  Tipping a little over $20 for lunch, including tax and tip, we got pretty much what we expected...a high quality meal in a place that allows you, for one moment, to assume that you are a mover and shaker and this is where you should eat.",

The pairing was well matched, food was delicious, and service was on point. I signed up to hear about the next wine dinner because I thought everything was wonderful.

We tried a raw oyster platter of 2x all 4 varieties, shrimp cocktail, and crab claws. The oysters were wonderful and fresh and the server was knowledgeable and answered all my questions.  He helped me pair our sea food with a wonderful Gewurztraminer from Cave Springs  Winery. They were served with cocktail sauce, a house hot sauce that was amazing, a apple vinaigrette, shaved horseradish and lemon. The crab and the shrimp were ok but nothing special.   The seafood is served over a fake rubber seaweed that frankly disappointed me. Such an upscale restaurant should have a better presentation for their seafood than rubber seaweed.",

We went down to the bar after dinner for a drink, the cocktails were creative and delicious. Bar looked pretty well stocked, there's also a menu for bar food and the raw bar if you just want apps.

I really believe everyone should get bread with their meal... am i right??? My entree was the scallops and wow was it good. The combo of scallops and pork belly with potato and beet hash was a tasty idea. I definitely enjoyed the meal, but it was fairly pricey for the amount of food and service that I got, and the experience was just alright.....",

The food was amazing and restaurant service was top notch. Prices are high, but I'm willing to pay a bit more for really great food sometimes and this qualifies. The monkfish wrapped in bacon and scallops were both delicious. We were both torn between the two and neither of us made a bad choice (I tasted the scallops, too, and they were wonderful). The bread appetizer was super hot and delicious. We will definitely go back! Almost everything on the menu and delivered to nearby tables looked great.",

And of the restaurants that I have visited in many cities with my boyfriend, this place stands out the most. We were in Pittsburgh for a few days on a work trip and wanted some great food. The hostess helped us with our suitcases and was very friendly. We decided to go with the Pre-Fix Brunch which is very affordable considering the quality of food. I didn't enjoy my appetizer (shrimp cocktail-- so the server suggested I try something else. The Avocado Toast is TO DIE FOR!!!! So yummy. For my entree, I had the Steak and Eggs which came with a yummy hollandaise sauce. My mimosa was STRONG and my boyfriend enjoyed the Standard Breakfast that included pork belly. The price was very affordable -I can't stress this enough, considering the location. Don't think twice about coming here.",

    "text": "Union Standard has been in my bookmarks for quite some time now, but today that changed. My friend and I had made brunch plans admittedly at a different restaurant. I completely forgot to make reservations until last minute and they couldn't take us until 1:30. We like to brunch early, so I made the suggestion of coming here after finding out they had open tables and we were not disappointed!   This is a restaurant with an ever evolving menu and changes based on the season. If you see something you would like to try, you better hurry on over before it disappears. Prices are pretty average for the quality of food you are receiving. There is a parking garage across the street which is very convenient and inexpensive.   We started off with our brunch cocktails. She ordered a bloody mary ($9) and I ordered a mimosa ($9). Lexi takes her bloody mary's very seriously. She raved about the pickled veggies! I would have to say that my mimosa was also very delicious and definitely wasn't lacking on the prosecco! We both ordered the griddled salami and swiss cheese potato bread ($11). It comes topped with whole grain mustard hollandaise and two eggs sunny side up. The salami and swiss are baked into the bread and it's pretty thick. The bread itself is soft and fresh. We did wish that they gave you two slices instead of one (we liked it that much). We like things saucy and they were not stingy on the delicious hollandaise sauce! I am so happy we got to give this place a try and I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a solid brunch spot.  Brunch is offered Saturday's and Sunday's from 10 - 2.",

Inside of the Union Trust Building. *Once the Union Arcade, a storefront mall, of 230 stores built by Henry Clay Frick in 1917.... must explore the history of this building and walk through it to see the open vault dome inside.  Restaurant: Trendy and Modern. Soft Lighting and Various Seating Options (High Tables, Private Tables and Seating on 2nd Floor, Low Tops and Booths) The atmosphere is comfortable, warm and calm.   Food: The chef Derek Stevens was known for working as executive chef at Eleven and also at the Duquesne Club, Casbah and Hyeholde. The food is artistic and well-balanced contemporary American. You can order anything from a kale salad to a ribeye to a cauliflower shnitzel. They have an excellent raw bar and east coast oyster selections. Also, many options for vegan and gluten free foodies.  Service: Jigmed and Wayne are excellent managers that will take great care of you and ensure all of your needs are met. This includes private parties and large group accommodations.  The wait staff know the menu very well and are attuned to giving great recommendations.   Overall: It's a must-do in downtown. One of the best restaurants in the Historic District and fair priced. It should be $$ instead of showing $$$ to accurately describe the cost. They have an excellent happy hour with $1 oysters and discounted drinks. The menu is diverse and changing and it is a reminder of the chef's experience as your changing appetite is satisfied each visit. It's very relaxing and impressive and it's very rare when you find a location that the food quality exceeds the price point.",

Considering the reputation of chef-owner Derek Stevens, we had a very disappointing experience. I will not be back and recommend avoiding.",

    "text": "Yum! If I could choose only one word for this restaurant, it would be that one. We arrived early for an 8:30 reservation (because that's our thing) and were immediately seated in a cozy half-moon shaped booth in the bar area. We like to drink so the bar was perfect for us. It was also fairly secluded and gave us an opportunity to unwind without having to put on airs, as they say, for fellow diners. Note that the formal dining area was fairly dressy compared to our just-roamed-the-city in the pouring rain sneakers and jeans.  Our waiter greeted us with menus and gave us a few moments to pick our respective poisons for the evening. Old Fashions and Gin & Tonics, of course. The cocktails were crafted beautifully with fresh citrus peel and herbs accordingly.   McDreamy opted to start his meal with a bowl of steamed clams that were sitting amidst a luscious broth of chorizo and onion. He lamented how only on the Cape do they call them 'steamers' but still ate every clam he found in the bowl AND sopped up some of the broth with the accompanying grilled bread. I selected a beet salad to start and was very happy with the ratio of beets to greens and other ingredients. It was a beet salad therefore the emphasis was on the beets and less on the salad...yay!   For our main courses, I took a chance on the Cauliflower Spaetzle and he chose the Grilled Salmon. A word of warning - the cauliflower dish is huge. We could have easily split just that. Actually, we did split it. I handed over an entire patty with half of the lentils. There was plenty remaining on my plate for me and McDreamy got the best of both worlds. His salmon smelled delicious and was cooked to a perfect medium.   The only unfortunate part of the meal was the dessert menu, which simply didn't have anything that piqued our interest enough to indulge. All in all, though, we were very happy with Union Standard. It would be great for a fancy date night but they were just as accommodating for two drowned rats enjoying a trip to the city. We're looking forward to our next trip so we can pop in again.",

My wife and I split a standard burger and their french toast, both of which we enjoyed. Bare in mind they come by themselves, no sides. We weren't overly hungry so it ended up being the right amount of food for us.

    "text": "I don't even know where to begin but I guess I'll start by saying his brunch was AMAZING! A friend and I planned to check out Or, The Whale but sadly couldn't get a reservation so we ended up switching it to Union Standard. At the time I was upset but looking back I'm so happy it happened.  The restaurant itself is super cute. It's not super big but it's not super tiny either. The tables are nicely spaced out into different sections which almost makes it feel more intimate. As if you aren't in a restaurant with tons of other people. It was really nice.  I told myself I wouldn't get a drink at brunch today but I caved and got a bloody mary. Boy am I glad I caved! The flavor was delicious and the pickled veggies on top were to die for. It came with a pickled green bean, cauliflower, garlic glove, pickle, and a sweet pepper. Each one of them having the perfect flavor. They were clearly made fresh in house and you could tell by the crisp, fresh flavor. They weren't pickled too much or too little. They were pickled just enough to give it a very mild but awesome flavor.   For my entree I switched the giddled salami and swiss eggs at the very last second. I somehow completely missed it on the menu and I'm beyond grateful that my friend pointed it out to me. The dish has a thick piece of toast with salami slices in it that is toasted on both side. On top of that is 2 fried eggs with a outrageously delicious hollandaise sauce. I don't think I've ever tasted a hollandaise sauce that good. All of those flavors mixed together was out of this world. I truthfully debated ordering a second plate and I haven't stopped thinking about it all day.   On top of all that, the prices are actually reasonable. All too often I check out brunch spots and the drinks are outrageous and so are the entrees. My total only came to $21 which I think is extremely reasonable for a brunch. Granted they do have some pricier options on the menu but for the most part it all looked like fair prices in my opinion.  Union Standar, I will definitely be back for you soon! I will use any excuse to bring someone else here for some delicious brunch.",

I wasn't hungover, but if I was - it wouldn't have stood a chance against this breakfast.  You'd probably need an empty stomach to tackle this.  Also, pretty solid coffee.  Make sure they don't sit you in that front area- call ahead and get a booth.",

    "text": "This restaurant was recommended by a fellow events professional who lives here. I am so glad that we went.  Entree: scallops with pork belly. The scallops and beets and sweet potato hash were so flavorful. I am not sure what happened to the pb. It was still a solid dish Apps: Wings--crispy and flavorful like I like them. Don't miss out on the sauce, US's spin on ranch. Mmm. Oysters: Another category. They were so good and I dug the peppery miognette (sp?). There is a varietal called a blonde something. Get those. I forget the other type we ate. Their house hot sauce is super flavorful too.  Side:  Cauliflower with chicharrones aka pork rinds, baby! Why was that sooo good? I don't know. Just eat!  Service: We sat right near the bar. At one point we looked up and we were the only ones eating. First Friday after the holidays, I guess. The bar was well stocked. I had a type of gin and tonic,  but the tonic was flat and it had an orange slice and anise in it. More gin and more bubbly tonic, por favor. I'll ask next time, I was too focused on the meal. Our server was friendly and attentive.  Thanks, Pittsburgh!",

They were very fresh and clean tasting. The second appetizer was the steak tartare. I was disappointed. There were several onions that were not uniformly chopped. They were the size of your pinky finger. It was not just one, but six large cuts compared to the rest cut properly. Also they used way too much mustard.  So much so that all you could taste was the mustard and you could not taste the mineral flavor of the raw beef. Lastly the beet chips were greasy and soggy.   The staff was friendly and polite. The friends I was with had the Monk Fish and they said it was delicious. So, I will give this place another try and just chalk it up to a bad plate that got by Chef.",

    "text": "Tl/dr: interesting ideas but bland and severely overpriced.   I was extremely disappointed with my visit to union standard. We came for a nice date night and based on the reviews, pictures, and menu descriptions my wife and I were really excited to try the flavor combinations that were offered. Based on what we saw in pictures we were expecting a higher end food experience like something you'd get from a cooking show. It started off great, they checked our coats and asked if we wanted sparkling or still water, and my wife asked for the sparkling which was brought in a large bottle which we later found out cost $7 which I wish had been mentioned.   We shared the shishito peppers appetizer which sounded great. What we got was a major disappointment: a cast iron dish filled with roasted peppers, a couple cheese curds melted to the bottom of the pan and some lime sauce lightly dispersed over the peppers along with one slice of bread split in half. This dish felt like a great idea poorly executed. Only about 1 in 5 peppers had any cheese or sauce on them. When I did eat a pepper with the dressings it was great!  This is a $14 appetizer that could have been so much more. It really should have been 6 peppers split in half, topped and served on individual toast slices!    For our main course we had the sea scallops and the cauliflower schnitzel.  The scallop dish was basically a mound of diced beets, 3 scallops, and about 3oz of pork belly. The scallops were very rubbery, and otherwise unremarkable. The pork belly was dry, not sure what it was braised in or why some of that sauce wasn't included?      The schnitzel could have been confused with a cauliflower casserole. The whole dish felt like a collection of sides. We didn't see the point of the lentils in sour cream.   All of this was $100 for average food and I don't see why this restaurant is so highly reviewed. Maybe the chef wasn't there and the sous chefs were new, but I wouldn't risk another visit to find out.",

Then when you balance that with the pricing factor, you really just end up with a \"ok\" meal that is relatively high in price given the selection.   I had the steak and my boyfriend had the trout. Both again, totally ok, but nothing outstanding. The steak was not a great cut, even for a strip steak, but was cooked properly. The flavor of the peanut sauce was good, but no wow factor here. I would have been happy with this steak if I had paid $22, not $39. Such is life. I don't really care as much for fish, but I actually preferred my boyfriend's trout, which tasted like a large smoked fish stick. Not a bad thing, just really the food does not even match the cool environment somehow. Really wanted to love Union Standard. I will not be coming back, as I am not sure this was a miss and is perhaps more the consistent offering. Again, ok. But less than ok with you factor in the price.  Edit: I was rating two stars, but after we waited about 40 minutes to get our credit card back, I had to downgrade. Absolutely will not be back. This place had a lot of potential with failed execution. I do not imagine it will be around long.",

The wings and swordfish BLT in particular seemed promising. I will have to come try the latter at some point, since I love swordfish.  I drank a rose negroni (I'm on a negroni kick at the moment) and it was a fragrant, delicious accompaniment to the oysters. We shared eighteen $1 oysters, complete with the usual horseradish and house-made mignonettes. I wish there had been hot sauce and crackers, but otherwise I had no complaints. The oysters were fresh and tasty, no complaints there! We will have to come back soon to try the food, as it looked promising.",

    "text": "Union Standard is a chic, tasty restaurant with solid attention to detail at a premium price for Pittsburgh.  Nothing sets it apart from an elite experience, but it deserves it's own 5 star review for checking every box well.  Except for the price, I'd recommend it regularly!  Pros:  The food was excellent.  I'm not a fan of raw bars in Pittsburgh, but my group was and the group-ordered oysters and shrimp cocktail were excellent, fresh and accompanied by a variety of sauces/toppers that were equally fresh and delicious.  Additionally the Warm Potato Bread was served perfectly warm and in no need of butter, even though the added butter was sweet and delicious (if a little cold).    I also had the Wood Grilled Berkshire Pork Porterhouse which was solid.  First it was large and surprisingly cooked to order (for pork, a rarity even in the best restaurants).  I found the rub a little lacking in flavor, but the excess string beans were delicious and still crisp.  I'd probably suggest the fish, as my group enjoy fish dishes quite well.  Finally, we finished with desserts of Chocolate Cake and Walnut Dulce de Leche pie.  The cake was dry and perhaps not terribly fresh but the pistachio ice cream was delicious and certainly local if not made on site- very creamy.  The walnut dulce de leche pie was the star with thick caramelized sugar layer and delicious flaky crust that was reminiscent of baklava (in pie form) and the salted caramel ice cream was equally good to the pistachio.    Service was equally incredible with fast servers and very knowledgeable staff.  We found the staff capable at describing and recommending beers, food choices and seafood w/o issue which is as impressive as it is hard to find.    Cons:  The bulk of the menu is below 40 dollars with a few items pushing closer to 50 which seemed in line with the area and the restaurant itself.  Beers were overpriced (8-9 dollars), but featured solid selections and good pairings.    The space was a modern-chic that was slightly uncomfortable, but not that noticeable.  Bathroom space was up 2 floors from the bottom (except 1 sex-less bathroom on the 2nd floor) was a little odd.    Conclusion:  For a slightly classy dinner out, you could not far worse than Union Standard.  For our trip into town, it was a great dinner for all and it came highly recommended for a reason.  The next time in town, I think we might be back.",

The highlights were the potato bread with carrot jam and seasoned butter and most especially the dessert. Seriously, skip dinner and go for the dulce de leche dessert. The lemon dessert was sad next to the other one, which I'd put in the top of desserts I've ever had! Friendly service, nice enough space.",

Menu was good but short with just enough options but nothing that couldn't be obtained elsewhere.  Flavors were good!  Best part was the bread service and soup which was very tasty.  Overall it's a super location downtown with good ambiance and nice flavors. Parking available in garage but no valet.  I'll give it another try maybe it was just a different night",

    "text": "Union Standard is unusual and difficult to describe and review. It's located in an old storefront in the corner of an office building. The space has been nicely remodeled in a style you would probably have to call modern, but there's nothing distinctive about it and there are lots of hard surfaces, so it's pretty loud in the dining rooms. Service was nicely paced, friendly, and professional. The menu is very limited with several appetizers, a few salads, and 6 or 7 mains, most of which are seafood. Our martinis and wine were great, but the wine list is very limited and prices are a little higher than they should be. The food, a creative pasta, German style fried cauliflower entree, and lemon desert were all excellent. Overall it was a very good experience and we'll probably return, but the sparse menu and wine list make it unlikely that we'll become regulars.",

    "text": "A little upscale, but still low key, this place offers impeccable service and some clever dishes.   I loved the idea of their cauliflower schnitzel sandwich. Vegetarian sandwiches are often boring and a big let down, but Union Standard definitely upped the game with this meal. Loaded with veggies, the cauliflower was breaded and fried, which made me feel like I was eating some sinful comfort food. The cauliflower was flavourless, unfortunately. I wish it had been marinated or cooked with more garlic or something cause it was a little lackluster. The breading and other toppings mostly made up for this though. My biggest issue was that the sandwich was very hard to eat - with the cauliflower and thick bread it was too big to bite into, and it all fell apart right away.    The prices are on the high side, but I think it's worthwhile for the level of service and atmosphere. The portions are also very substantial and I was stuffed before I could finish my sandwich.",

Well, just to say - it was the BEST recommendation we had!  This place was a short walk (10min) from our hotel (Westin) and was not packed, but looked a little busy. As we had no reservation, we told the hostess we came on the recommendations (as per above) and she went to talk to Olive - and we were seated at a hightop within a few minutes.  Talk about service - Olive was exceptional and took our drink orders after putting forward several suggestions and some of their signature drinks.  I found an IPA that I stuck with all evening. It was a locally brewed beer and was very good. We were all very happy with choices that came out in the appetizers - we were only a group of 6 so shared everything family-style - which we do when together often.  We all had a main meal and were all very satisfied with the quality and the portion sizes (not huge thankfully).  Make the effort - go here and eat - and drink - and savour the super choices that are on the menu.  Special thanks to Olive for taking the BEST care of us and providing outstanding service and suggestions - and to her BF Jack for initially telling us to check this place out!",

When trying to decide on an appetizer we both decided squash blossoms were the choice as we had both never had them before.  I'm not sure how I never had them before - they were SO absolutely scrumptious.  I could have certainly had them as my meal.    For my entree - I got the salmon.  2 things to point out with the salmon 1.  I asked for it rare.  It wasn't.  But that was NOT a problem.  The flavor made up for it.  2.  I am a salt heavy type of person.  (Although I never ask for it when it is not on a table).  This did not need any additional seasoning (In a good way!)  It was absolute perfection flavor wise.    We chose not to get a dessert - but our sweet waitress still brought us a slice of brownie with a candle for my birthday.    If you haven't been to Union Standard - go.  I have already told many people about it and how scrumptious the food was.  I can't wait to go back for brunch and dinner again!",

My favorites was a tres leches and coconut donut.   For my main course I ordered the steak and eggs. Steak and eggs are always a good choice at restaurants like these and they did not disappoint. The steak was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of char and flavoring.   For dessert I had their pot de creme and it was deliciously fluffy and airy.

They were very well made and had ingredients such as maraschino and other popular spirit forward liquors.  It did take a little longer to get our cocktails vs. the food we ordered.  We got oysters and the steak tar tar for starters.   Both were delicious.  The portion of steak tar tar was really large.  I got the cod for my main.  It was just ok, not really a lot of flavor, so that is why I am giving only 4 stars.  It was a little disappointing after such delcious appetizers.

There is something to be said about a clean, light dish that incorporates a little restraint. It's almost like every dish is trying to be the star of the show and there are no really interesting supporting characters. It's clear that Chef Stevens really put some thought into his dishes, which is cool. However, having an app for sharing, a starter, an entree AND dessert, will leave you feeling heavy and uncomfortable. I'd recommend sharing a Salad (which all are seemingly hearty) and then having an entree. You could really just have an entree and be good. We had the Salmon and Halibut, both really decadent. The desserts don't really stand up to the attention to detail and beautiful, luxe flavor profiles of the rest of the menu. In my opinion, for a restaurant that seems to have been really thought out in every capacity, the endings/desserts arnt even in the same playing field, but then again, we came there for dinner and, honestly, I'm not much of a dessert person. If they toned down the richness of their offerings, allowed for a few really lovely supporting characters, hired a pastry chef, Union Standard would be an absolute, hands down, home run.",

I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, which I've had before and enjoyed, but this time it was very hard to eat because it was stinky from what I think was maple syrup. It also didn't have much flavor, mixed with the fries that had pickled onions on top just made for a weird taste. I would go back only because I have been there when the food was delicious!",

The bread was tasty but the calamari dish was a salt bomb.   We ate it, and then drank a lot of water.  Main courses were okay, but none of them had the complexity or high notes we were expecting with all of the five star reviews we had read.  I got the dutch baby for dessert and I liked it a lot.    I guess at the end of the day we expected more from the reviews and the price point ,but hopefully they will find their groove over time.",

The \"massive seafood appetizer to share\" I was hunk was 6 bites of mixed seafood. Not 6 each, I mean 2 shrimp bites, 2 lobster bites 2 seafood salad bites and maybe all. I could eat 3 myself. Needless so say PORTIONS VERY SMALL. Not enough courses to make up front like other comparable high end \"small portion\" places tend to do.

The crispy fried pork croutons melted in your mouth like a flavor bomb of pork goodness.

The food was stale and tasted as if it had been prepared last night.  The drinks were completely overthought and not very enjoyable.  Honestly we left and went to Urban Tap and had a much better dining experience.  For context, we eat in a lot of restaurants of all $$$$ amounts so we're not unfamiliar with the trends in cuisine.  No reason to ever go back here and this is not one of the best restaurants in the City.  It's not even one of the best restaurants downtown.",

The ambience is subtle allowing the old buildings across the street to shine- the William Penn, Oliver building and Mellon square comprised a beautiful backdrop. We started with a selection of oysters and the potato bread. The oysters were fantastic served with lemon, fresh horseradish and two other sauces. The potato bread was a little loaf sprinkles with salt and dill. Two butters and a tomato chutney complimented it perfectly. We tried the Heirloom  Tomato salad which featured fresh tasting red and yellow tomatoes, some greens and cornbread croutons. I wasn't wild about the croutons, they had a funny texture but the salad was good otherwise. We tried the cauliflower schnitzel and the cauliflower gratin. The schnitzel was a miss for me although tasty. The fried cauliflower was a little too oily. However the cauliflower gratin was the best second only to my mother's. We finished with a watermelon upside down cake which was amazing. It was both moist and crispy topped with plum sorbet and a lovely sour cream. The service was so helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. What a great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene.",

I had to ask for it, which took the waiter about 5 minutes to bring it back.   The food was AMAZING!  I had 5 kinds of oysters, including some amazing ones. I also had the popcorn with Foie Gras, and the hamachi with grilled ramps (fantastic!).   Service, however, was lacking. It was 2:30pm, the restaurant was mostly empty. And yet, things took forever, and waiters would disappear often. When I was ready to leave, there was literally no staff within eye or earshot.

    "text": "We really like Union Standard.  It's not cheap, and so the expectations are higher, but they have delivered the several times we've been there.  First, this is a place that knows how to prepare an oyster.  They are always shucked properly (not beat up like you can get at places in Pittsburgh), and they have different varieties, which we always like.  They serve their mignonette with an eye dropper, so you can add just a drop or two, and have the taste compliment the oyster rather than overpower it.   The rest of the menu is good and inventive.    Funny, but with everything on the menu, let me recommend their burger.  I think it's one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh.  Now I don't want to start a fight on this one.  I love Tessaros burgers, and Burgatory is a favorite place to make your own custom burger, but the burger at Union Standard is one of my favorite right-off the menu burgers.  It's simple, not overly topped with this and that, and so it relies on the burger itself being well seasoned, which it is.  And then there's the Marrownaise.  Can you guess what that is?  Yes, it's what you think it is, and it's excellent!  We've had the crisp smelts, and they're great, and the crispy squash blossoms with ramps chimichurri, also great.    Good selection of beers, good service, nice atmosphere.  All together it's one of our favorites.",

Although, a distant second to New Orleans and running close to several other great cities, I am always taken back by the taste of Pittsburgh. Well, I found another one; the Union Standard is great. I had Scallops, grits, topped with apple crumbs...  I would highly this place to any lover of seafood. I'll be back!  I don't have intel on the price but this is close to being priceless. Mojito are awesome as well...",

Large, cooked and seasoned spectacularly (Thank you Chef), accompanied by fresh carrots, micro-green, radishes, and a light dressing, the sea scallops took on another life of their oen  Thrilled with my lunch, with one day left in the 'burgh', I hope that I can return for dinner.",

It has only been open a few days but the service was very good and our server seemed pretty knowledgeable about the menu.  The bar has a decent amount of beer about 8 on tap and 8 or so in bottles, a decent wine list and of course fancy drinks.  There is a small oyster bar with several different types of oysters, stone crab claws and lobster and some interesting Snacks at the bar. Started with the Jubilee Steak Tartare that had sunflower seeds, sprouts, pickled garlic and deviled egg dressing with a couple of great homemade potato chips sticking out of the top. I enjoyed the tartare but it seemed a little bland to me.  For the main course the Lamb shank was tender and one of the better lamb shanks I have had.  Was not hungry for desert but had some wonderful Millie's Sorbert.  Looking forward to returning to try some of the other items and desert to go along with a dessert drink.",

Additionally, the bathrooms at this place were phenomenal.  I really recommend visiting the bathroom if you get a chance. LUCKILY my table was in a premo location right next to it.  Lot's of fish options on the menu...I would say it even gives Long John Silvers a run for it's money. They offered something called a swizzle on the drink menu. I pictured it with a crazy straw but I was a tad disappointed when it turned out to be an adult snow cone.  Definitely will be back here for the adult snow cones but I would love it if they put some PBR and lime-a-ritas on the drink menu to add some class",

    "text": "Bar Review Only  I stopped in for a drink with some friends. When we walked in I was immediately hit with the smell of slightly off fish. I love eating seafood and cooking it and know that it shouldn't smell like that. Since we just came for drinks, I wasn't worried.   The bar is in a big open space and has a modern hotel bar feel to it. We got a seat in the bar area and the upbeat, friendly server came over and greeted us. We asked a couple of questions about the drink menu and made our selections.  I like dark beer and there were two on the menu that were local, so I was happy. Then the server came back and said they just ran out of my chosen beer. I chose the other dark beer they had and the server came back again and said that beer had just run out too and they were replacing it with a wheat beer. Strike two! The only dark beer they had left was in bottles. This process took about 20 minutes and by this point some of my friends were part of the way through their drink.   The server offered an amber beer to try and I liked that, so I ordered it. A different server brought a beer to our table, but it was the wrong one. The beer they brought was a wheat beer, that looked like orange juice. Strike three! After about 40 minutes I still didn't have a beer. At this point, my friends were almost done with their drinks and I just wanted to leave. One of the managers came up to our table, said they were sorry and took one of my friends drinks off the tab. I was really looking forward to liking this place, but things just didn't go well.",

    "text": "Went here on the second night of service, and was impressed.   We got there about an hour early and headed to the bar. Tyler was helpful with recommendations and made a mean cocktail. We had the Union Mule and the Mint Julep, both were excellent. We opted to order a few things from the raw bar: 2 Kumamoto Oysters, 2 Cranberry Creek Oysters, and 2 Littleneck Clams and an order of the Smelts from the bar snack menu. The accompaniments for the raw bar are really great and I enjoyed the fresh shaved horseradish and the homemade hot sauce. My husband said the mignonette sauce was delicious. The smelts were also well cooked and the charred lemon was a nice touch.   The hostess then came over to the bar to let us know that our table upstairs was ready and gave us a few moments to settle up at the bar, and then lead us to a small banquette table between two others. We had nice companions on our side and spent much of dinner conversing with them, but if that is not to your liking you may want to request a more private table.   Our waitress was very helpful, but sadly I can not recall her name. We ordered 2 share plates the potato bread which is phenomenal and a must order and the blue crab skillet. Though the blue crab was good and had plenty of crab it fell a little flat for us, we felt like it needed a touch more seasoning, but luckily my husband grabbed the hot sauce from our raw bar plate from earlier and brought it with us to the table and it was delicious on the dip.   We later ordered some firsts to share rather than an entree, though I will say as it was the 2nd night they were out of 3 entrees by the time we went to order(a hiccup that I know will be rectified with time). We decided to share the Sea Scallops, the Tartare, and the Red Oak and Spinach Salad. My husband loved the tartare! The Red Oak and Spinach Salad is a must order! We did end up sending back the scallops due to them being overcooked, but again something that will get better with time.   For dessert we had the German Chocolate Donut which is topped with Millies Homemade Salted Caramel Gelato. This dessert was phenomenal!   I can't wait to go back and try some of the entrees and definitely to get that salad again!",

For an appetizer, I ordered the scallops - they were perfectly cooked and the flavor combination with the chicken broth was delicious.   Now for the main course - the Lamb Shank. I rarely order anything other than chicken or steak but I was feeling adventurous. I will honestly say I had an out of body experience eating this. It was the best piece of meat I've had in a long time! ;) The serving size was very generous - two very large cuts on top of multiple types of potatoes and just enough gravy.",

We waited over 15 minutes for someone to greet us and provide water. Our waiter had a waiter-in-training and made no issue making it known that he was not pleased to have to train someone. The crappy service continued all night. We literally had to flag other waiters to get our waiter to wait on us and at one point ordered our drinks 2 at a time because it took about a half hour to get a drink. The food wasn't much better. I got the monkfish, my fiance got the rib-eye, and our friends got the clams and salmon. While the potato bread was excellent, the rest of the food was bland and unremarkable. Definitely NOT worth the price.   Sub-par food, terrible service - all four of us agreed, Union Standard is overrated and under-delivers. We won't be back.",
