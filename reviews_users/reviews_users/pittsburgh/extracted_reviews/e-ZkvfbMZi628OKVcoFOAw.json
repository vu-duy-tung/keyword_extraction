Yes the proportions of rice to other ingredients is completely off, but what you get is pretty good tasting product that is health and really affordable. This kind of place is going to be in every college town and every food court in the next 10 years. I guarantee it.   I ordered a salmon roll with avocado, cucumber, and jalapeno, so obviously I wasn't looking for anything amazing authentic. The taste is pretty good, better than those to go containers you see everywhere now. The only problem is the pieces are so huge you can't eat them like regular sushi unless you have a huge mouth.",

The fish was surprisingly fresh. I did think that there was too much rice on the roll (especially considering how big they get when you stuff them with two proteins and three veggies) and the rice was a little over-vinegared. But hey, for fast food sushi...I've had much, much worse. And on the plus side, if you ask for masago, they heap tons of the stuff on. Yuuum.  While it's not the best sushi ever, I know I would totally come here at least once a week if I still lived in Oakland.",

I will say that the rolls ARE huge, as many people on here have said, so if you're just looking to fill your belly for not too much money, this is probably a good place. But my sushi smelled fishy and was really flavorless. I had a spicy tuna roll and the other thing I didn't like about it was how much spicy sauce was on it. Someone on yelp used the word \"drenched\", and that is also how I would describe it. I won't be back.   On the upside, it is very clean inside and it appears they have wifi - lots of people using computers.",

Being a huge sauce fan, one of the best things is the assortment of dressings for your creation, which includes wasabi mayo and spicy chilli.  The place is small, like many in Oakland, however the decor is modern and clean.

There is also no confusion about what is or is not available.   On the other hand, the model extracts the art of being a sushi chef from the process; that is, they have a machine to bed the rice on the seaweed, a machine to cut the roll,  and the fish all comes in pre-cut rectangular prisms. (Part of the sushi experience for me is finding a sushi chef who can perfectly cut along the seam of the fish which ensures a smooth taste to the fresh fish).  At Fuku, this mechanized process yields a huge roll (as you can pick three vegetable ingredients in addition to a meat or fish) with a disproportionate amount of rice at a reasonable price (my customized roll cost under $9). Which works out as the establishment is clearly target at college students.",

I got the Korean roll thinking it might have similar flavors to a korean taco I enjoy elsewhere, but the steak was flavorless, and so dry it was impossible to chew and painful to swallow. The kimchi had no flavor and did not save the otherwise bland mayo and beef combination. Bad decision. But this seems to reflect on the quality of their ingredients that are used in their food, and in the build your own as well.  On the upside, portions are huge (like 10 pieces per roll) and are a steal for the price, and this is a notch above any campus sushi I've ever had, so there's that at least.",

    "text": "Confusing concept and the sushi could taste much better.    Sushi Fuku is a new restaurant that just opened up in Oakland.   It's assembly line-style sushi (a la Chipotle).    I think most people will simply pick their FEATURE rolls or bowls (about $7 each), where the combinations of protein, vegetables, and sauces have already been decided for you.  I've had the pittsburgh roll and the california roll and they were both mediocre.  The vegetables and protein are not fresh, and they DRENCH the sushi in sauce.   SESAME SEEDS are lacking in the rolls, so that nutty and added flavor is missing.    You can customize your sushi too.  While their concept is advertised as being as easy as 1-2-3, it's just CONFUSING.  I'm not sure people are comfortable customizing sushi like a burrito.      In summary, I think they need to drop the customized sushi concept and improve the quality of their sushi.",

You pick the dwelling for your food, like Chipotle, then your protein, veggies, condiments, and watch the magical process happen, as the machine slices the roll into 10 LARGE pieces.

    "text": "I visited for lunch today at around noon with a friend.  Since it'd been awhile since I'd last had sushi, and I'd had Sushi Fuku bookmarked for eons, I was excited to try a new lunch spot in Oakland.  Based on Larissa G.'s review and the photos, I decided to order the rainbow roll with wasabi mayo as a dressing.  All of the options on the serving line looked good, and it was fun to watch the employees assembling the rolls by hand, with interesting tools and machines for assistance.  The final product resembled the photos I'd seen quite well, with a beautiful assortment of colors.  Flavorwise, I found the rolls on the bland side, but the wasabi mayo and dressings (wasabi sauce, ginger, soy sauce) helped to dress them up--and then again, this is seafood we're talking about.  The price ($10.33 w/o tax) seemed on the high side for the amount and quality of sushi received (10 rolls), esp. in comparison to other comparable sushi joints in PGH (e.g., another sushi place downtown is charging the same for twice as much food).  Appropriate for a fast casual joint, service was efficient and friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and minimalist.  In terms of the ordering setup, decor, etc., I can definitely see the similarity to Chipotle that other reviewers have commented on.  As another reviewer mentioned, it was pleasantly uncrowded--a rarity during peak lunch hours in Oakland.  If you're looking for a quick carry out lunch in Oakland without fighting the crowd, this is a good alternative to Oishii Bento across the street and the chains on Forbes Ave.  3.5 stars.",

    "text": "SETTING Cool modern look with big screens on the wall to walk you through the ordering process. Casual. Chipotle/Subway-esque \"made to your order\" assembly line. Clean environment, which is hard to find in Oakland.  FOOD I don't think Sushi Fuku is trying to be a fancy sushi joint. It knows it's place in the sushi market and efficiently cranks out rolls that attempt to be the \"best bang for your buck\", only that there wasn't much \"bang\".  I made my own roll: Brown rice (choose white or brown), shrimp tempura (choose 1 meat), avocado, cucumbers, kimchi (choose 3 veggies), wasabi ginger sauce and sesame seeds (choose 2 sauces). Rice was kind of dry, avocado was browning a bit, and they gave me carrots instead of the cucumbers I asked for. They do have some creative sauces, though. I went with the wasabi ginger sauce, and it was okay. I like putting ginger on sushi, and they only give you a few small pieces on the side.  Everything just seemed a bit dry and bland. I'm not a sushi snob, but when I eat sushi, I prefer the rice to be a bit vinegary and a tiny bit moist and have the avacodos fresh. I LOVE avocados.  SERVICE Fast. They definitely have the assembly line down pat, which helps during busy lunch hours. Order and pay up front, then seat yourself.  IMPRESSIONS For 10 pieces at $7 (unless you order a menu item), it's not a bad deal, but I feel there are a few basic requirements that a properly made sushi needs to meet. Unfortunately that was not the case here. However, if you need a fast and light lunch on a budget you might want to give Sushi Fuku a try.",

    "text": "Almost a year after my first visit to Sushi Fuku I decided to give the place another shot. And I have to say, this time around the food I got was much better! I'd give them a 3.5 if I could since the meal wasn't quite \"Yay I'm a fan\" worthy, but they're still a step or two above just being \"a-ok.\"  My biggest complaint last time was the mix of rice vs. protein and vegetables in my sushi - specifically that my sushi was almost entirely rice, which isn't what I want in my sushi rolls. If I want rice, I'll order rice, and I certainly won't pay $7 - $10 for it! Fortunately my last visit earlier this week was much better than that first visit - I enjoyed an order of their Rainbow Rolls that was not 70% rice, and in fact featured exactly the right balance of rice vs. other ingredients.   The result was that while my sushi wasn't the freshest or greatest on the planet, it was certainly much more enjoyable than round one had been. I actually sat and savored that meal in Sushi Fuku, since they weren't super busy while I was there. I left feeling content and satisfied, and finally understanding why people get the appeal of coming in and ordering customizable sushi rolls. (Of course the catch with creating your own is that the ingredients won't necessarily mix and stick together well - one benefit of a standard menu is that it's been tested for things like that.) I still don't think they're necessarily the best or even cheapest sushi in the area - just depending on exactly what you order - but at least now I know that if I stop in and order sushi again I won't just be paying for a whole lot of rice with a dash of fish and vegetables. I'll definitely consider stopping in in the future.",

First up you can choose if you wanna go for sushi, a bowl or even a salad. Then choose brown or white rice (without paying extra!). You don't have to actually order the sushi rolls that are on the menu as you can also create your own. The sushi I had there was always really fresh. I am particularly picky with raw salmon and tuna, but the quality they offer is just really good.The staff is super friendly and fun. They always brighten up my late dine dinners before heading back to work! The place is quite small but if you're not heading there at 12pm  you should be fine. I haven't used their rewards program yet, but I'll definitely check that out next time I am getting one of their Twin City Rolls! yum!",

Minimalist and clean, in stark contrast to it's next-door neighbour, Sushi Boat. It feels like a much nicer restaurant than it is.   Which beings me to the food. It's not bad, but it really is the \"fast food\" of sushi in Oakland. You'll get your sushi in around 2 minutes. The rolls are huge too. To the point wear some people may have trouble fitting each cut into their mouth. The quality is okay, but Sushi Boat is better (and Little Tokyo in the Southside is better still).   TL;DR nice design, big serving sizes, mediocre sushi.",

We decided to go there instead and let's just say it's added to our list of places to eat lunch at once a week.  It's clean, it's new, the stuff is fresh...you can create your own sushi, you can create your own rice bowls.  My friend likened it to creating a burrito bowl at Chipotle.  What I'm most impressed with are the machines that lay the rice on the seaweed wrapper and the one that cuts the sushi into 10 perfect pieces.  It loses a little authenticity because it's not done by hand BUT, it's still awesome to watch.  Definitely worth a try if you're in search of sushi in Oakland.  I think it will win over the other 2 sushi places that are within steps of each other on Oakland Ave. (Sushi Boat and Oishi Bento).",

There are some pretty nifty gadgets they use like a machine that prints rice (white or brown) onto your seaweed (or soy wrap), and an automated cutter. The price is very good, especially considering how large their rolls are ($5 for a huge vegetarian roll). They have a separate cutter for veggie only rolls (not a big deal to me, but may be important for some vegetarians). Their sauces are delicious (I've only tried sweet chili and spicy mayo). And the toppings are good as well, especially the crunchy onions. The presentation is extremely nice, and the atmosphere is very clean and modern.   My wife and I loved it so much we went back the next day. Also, the staff is very friendly and will give you suggestions on what to get if asked.  Overall, after not having any good sushi for the last year or more, this place has me craving it once again. I will definitely be back, and soon!",

Not realizing I was going to be given so many options, I asked for a traditional tuna roll.  My lack of desire to customize seemed to confuse them, but it all worked out.  The sushi was really good.  My only complaint is that the pieces are pretty big.  I don't understand why you'd make pieces so big.  You can't cut sushi.

There are paper copies of the menu as you enter as well as a giant menu posted on the wall where you wait in line.  The two of us split 3 rolls, which was more than enough for a lunch, and reasonably priced on that front (with drinks, about $20). We tried one of their house rolls, the Korean roll, and I wasn't super impressed.  The kimchi was far too mild and the roll lacked the punchy flavors one would expect.  Our designed rolls were pretty good.  The fish is a pretty good quality, and the vegetables are all sliced properly such that they give a pleasant texture and an even distribution.  But the rice is pretty sad.  It's too thick a layer and too glopped together.  This may be a function of the machine, but this is something they should try to address.  One of our create-your-own rolls was a particular success--bacon, cream cheese, jalapenos, and scallions, with sriracha mayo on top.  If only they had tempura flakes--I could have made it a True jalapeno popper roll!  I wouldn't recommend their house rolls as they aren't authentic enough to live up to their simplicity, but this place is definitely worth a visit if you always had a hankering for some strange sushi concoction and you don't know how to roll your own.  This won't be my new \"go-to\" lunch spot, but it's a good contender among the rest of Oakland's options.",

For those of us who don't like sushi or even seafood they have a great bowl option that allows you to pick your protein, veggies, and sauces.  I had the white rice with grilled chicken, carrots, sprouts and avocado with sweet chili sauce. SO GOOD! I added some sriracha for added kick toward the end. They also were participating in the Restaurant Week here in Oakland, so $6.00 for plenty of food for lunch was awesome!   The seating options are limited so groups would have a harder time during busy parts of the day... all 2-top seats and there is a window facing bar for single / additional seating.  My friend said she loves the salmon bowl with yum-yum sauce - so it seems like the seafood is good too!",

They have a great variety of different choices of proteins, veggies, and toppings so pretty much everyone can find something they like on the menu. Their yum-yum sauce is ridiculously tasty, I put it on everything I order from there. I love the design-your-own bowl or roll idea and it's executed really well here. This location can get busy during the afternoon, but the staff does a good job of getting everyone's orders completed quickly. I really like that I can order takeout on Yelp beforehand and just go grab my order during my lunch break. Highly recommend overall!",

It's a counter sushi place with amazingly fast service where you get to pick your rice (white or brown), your type of wrap or bowl (burrito, cut roll, bowl), your protein (raw & cooked options and you can get more than one for a small extra fee), your extras inside, and then your toppings (if you get a bowl or cut roll). All the ingredients were super fresh. Service was fast and friendly. The prices are good - especially considering how much more seemed to be in this roll than an average roll. One roll each (with 2 proteins) and we were full. I can't wait to go back and wish there were one in Robinson, so I could go for lunch at work and more often for dinner.  If you haven't been to Sushi Fuku yet and want great, fresh, fast-food sushi, I can't recommend it more. Go now and enjoy!",

I think the sushi would have been under $7 on its own. I enjoyed the roll but the seaweed was just ok. This place seems to get busy at lunch time so plan accordingly. I went in at 1:30pm - post lunch hour rush, and enjoyed a quieter ambiance. The manager is really friendly and seemed to go out of his way to greet, thank, and chat with customers. That was nice to see. Also, i liked that this place is clean, from the eating area to the restroom. I'll be back for sure.",

I think the concept is really unique and the location is really perfect with the hospital being so close. Definitely a place you can grab a quick lunch which is always nice for those busy days.   I was pleasantly surprised by how big the sushi rolls were since I'm used to getting tiny shrimp tempura rolls from Nakama; which I don't mind. I decided to get shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, white rice and soy sauce ($6.95). They do not skimp you on the veggies they are pretty large in size. The shrimp was extra crispy which was really nice. I thought the sushi was flavorful, but I struggled with the seaweed being on the outside of the roll. It was kinda tough to chew and I would have preferred it was on the inside, but overall I thought everything was great. You get 10 rolls and I thought the price wasn't bad for how much get get. My friend ordered the Philly roll and she really liked it! I probably wouldn't pick something like that only because it's made with raw salmon.",

I've rarely, if ever, encountered an employee that is anything but helpful.

The clearly labeled Gluten Free and Vegan options with associated caloric estimates are an especially nice touch for the health-conscious crowd.   Also a great place to bring your friends if you want sushi and they do not - chicken, tofu, and cooked items are available and also quite tasty.   Bonus points for the excellent presentation and fun branding.

The roll was pretty good. I liked the crunch from the red onion and the sauces added a nice flavor. Unfortunately, they put so much sauce on I really couldn't taste the salmon too much. My friend got a teriyaki chicken sushi bowl and was pleased. A convenient place for decent sushi if you are in a hurry.",

But, on Sunday, we all went and ate inside. The people that work there are very nice and helpful. The menu is almost like a subway-style; you tell them what you want from an easy to follow menu, and they make it. We all had sushi (although they do have some cooked dishes). All very good. Fresh and certainly a good size portion. They have several sauces to choose from and that's always fun. No leftovers. It was quick too. I think with us pondering the menu and eating, we were done in about 45 minutes.  VERY nice that they recognize there are other people in Oakland besides the students as they were actually open where we noticed other locations on that street were closed.",

I always get the bowl, as I feel it is the best value. The fish is always pretty fresh but not perfect. I got the eel once and ended up picking it all out--there were so many bones that I couldnt even eat it. The rice is really lacking. Something in the seasoning is off and it makes me barely able to stomach it on it's own. Way too sweet, even for sushi rice. I do like all of the different options that they have, and the service is always fast and usually friendly. I have had a couple of borderline-rude experiences though. The dining area is always clean.  Overall, I'm happy to have Sushi Fuku as an option, but it's never really my first choice. Give it a try if you're new to sushi and want to customize what you get, but it's very far from a typical sushi experience.",

    "text": "On Oakland Ave, literally across the street from Oishii Bento and Chick'n Bubbly -two of my favorite eateries, is Sushi Fuku. Having been eating at those two places for a long while, I wondered if the grass was greener across the street and if I've been missing out on some really good meals at Sushi Fuku.   Sushi Fuku has been described like a sushi version of Chipotle/ Subway. You order at the counter and can pick from a set menu or customize your sushi roll/ burrito(seaweed wrapped)/ bowl to suit your fancy. The service is almost crazy fast and the food is plenty filling. You can't say the food is prepared half as fast across the way at Chick'n Bubbly or Oishii Bento. So, if you are in a rush and want the Subway Sushi experience, this is definitely the place for a quick fix.   The place is cute and designed for the uni clientele they serve in the Pitt Oakland area. We ate the Volcano bowl, Golden Dragon roll, fried gyoza and kimchi. The salmon in the Volcano bowl is smoked salmon. I would have preferred the fresh salmon and wonder if that is an option. I missed the seaweed wrapper taste in this deconstructed sushi bowl and didn't realize I would until I did.  To me, it was like the sushi version of the popular Hawaiian poke bowl. It was very filling but not my favorite.   The kimchi was good and I found myself eating it with the rice in the Volcano bowl because there was so much rice. The Golden dragon roll and gyoza were good, not spectacular.   I'm glad to check this place off my Oakland bucket list, but can't see myself choosing this place over my two other favs across the street.",

This was my first time here, and I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the choices... there are soooo many!! However, for people like me that have anxiety with too many options, they also have a predefined menu. I chose the volcano bowl, and it did not disappoint! All of the vegetables and greens were super fresh, and the rice was served piping hot. One note - the spicy mayo is VERY spicy... my mouth was on fire for a long time after leaving, but it was so good! If you're not a fan of spicy hot, definitely skip the mayo.  Next time I go, I would definitely try to make my own! You can choose to make a sushi roll, bowl, or sushi burrito. You get to choose the meat, vegetables, and the sauce on top, top!  This is a great little spot in Oakland, right on Pitt's campus. There is limited street parking out front, and it is pretty small inside, so I could see seating being in issue during busy times. However, it's definitely worth checking out!",

It's set up like a west coast Poky place, or a Subway. You order at one end, they build your meal, you pick up and pay.   The food. They have a small menu. It's essentially rolls, bowls, burritos and some apps.  The burrito is really the star of the show. They place a full sheet of nori under this machine and it craps out the perfect rice spread.  They then add the proteins and toppings of your choice and roll it all up in tin foil like Chipotle.  It's big, it's fresh and it's delicious!   The only complaint I would make is that the only fish they have is tuna and salmon.  It's not like a traditional sushi or poke place with lots of options.  I think they had some chicken but I'm not positive.  The place is clean and the soft drinks are refillable.   If you're in the neighborhood it's definitely worth checking out.",

You can design your own bowl or if you're like me you can choose a pre-designed one although there was only one option. Thankfully it was good! Two of my classmates chose sushi rolls instead of a bowl.   The place had plenty of seating and was moderately busy for a Saturday night in Oakland. I ate there and it was clean inside. Most of the patrons looked to be college students. The manager offered to clean up for me which was great but I was happy to throw away my own trash.   I got water to drink but there is a soda fountain with unlimited refills as well. I don't hang out in Oakland often but would be happy to go back next time.",

I have to admit, I was deeply disappointed with the bowl. Due to the assembly line and quick service concept of the place, the bowl was sloppily put together and there was no love or care put into it. The amount of tuna, rice, and well, any ingredients but the sauce, was a pitiful amount. The quality of the tuna and rice was also pretty mediocre compared to other places I've had on campus. The sauce they put on was overwhelming and made everything too salty.   For the price I paid, I wanted something a bit more and this place fell deeply short of that. If you are willing to wait maybe just 5 more minutes for your bowl and pay 50 cents more for a much much superior poke bowl, do yourself a favor and go next door to Mt. Everest where they actually put care (and a TON of fish) in your bowl.",

But c'mon - the place IS named Fuku. Admit it. You just smiled.   You know what else will make you smile? The sushi options here! Based on the Chipotle/Noodles & Co. approach of \"choose your own adventure food,\" Sushi Fuku allows you to build your own rolls with options such as white or brown rice, a variety of fish (including eel - yea!) and non-fish proteins, interesting veggie choices (such as the Korean treat kimchi), and tantalizing toppings like wasabi mayo.   I withheld one star only because this place gets PACKED weekdays at lunch, so you'll end up standing in line for quite a long time and probably won't find a place to sit. I also wish they had more adventurous options for the specialty rolls. Several of them aren't even made with fish. However, this is likely due to the typical Pittsburgher's less than daring palate. (Frankly, I'm surprised none of the specialty rolls are topped with fries. This is something they might want to consider for the Pittsburgh area.)  Overall, this place is worth a lunchtime visit. Just try to avoid going right at noon, unless you love long lines and eating while you stand.",

Then your food is handed off to the next employee where they ask what you want in your sushi.  Finally your food gets handed off to a third employee and adds in whatever type of sauce and finishes off your dish before handing it to you.  Price - Around what I would expect.  I had an eel roll for $7.   Portion - At first I thought \"how can one roll possibly fill me up?\" but I was struggling with that last piece.  The roll is bigger than your typical roll.   Ambiance - Minimalistic Asian inspired I would say.  They have a wall of condiments so you can grab as much soy soy, siracha, etc. for your dish.  I wouldn't recommend coming here in a big group because the tables are set up so you either sit by yourself or in a table for two people. Location - GREAT location if you work/live/or go to school at Pitt.    Great for vegans and vegetarians and you can get as crazy and inauthentic as you like.  My friend made a roll with asparagus, cream cheese, and crab.  We all enjoyed our meals and will be coming back.",

Pros: lots of choices, you can customize your roll, funny shirts, friendly staff, decent quality Cons: nowhere to sit, the fact that there is an assembly line of uncooked fish, the fact that their handling raw fish while wearing shirts with sexual tones (hehehehehe) I'll probably go back.",

Sushi Fuku offers a selection of sushi rolls found in most places, mostly as your regular combinations of tempura, salmon, tuna, unagi, shrimp, avocado, cucumber, etc. The alternative, if you prefer to eat the contents of your sushi as a rice bowl, is just that--you can choose to either \"roll it\" or \"bowl it.\" Bowl ordering is set up like a lunch line; you choose the type of rice, the meat, the veggies, the sauce, etc.  I've found the ingredients to be actually quite fresh the few times that I've been here. Being able to find normally expensive ingredients such as unagi or avocado at such low prices is a rarity in the area, and while not filled to the brim you do get a fair share if you choose to order them in your bowls or rolls.  The owners are quite friendly, and they sometimes come outside to convince you to go to their place rather than Oishii across the street. While Oishii does have a lot more variety, I sometimes prefer Sushi Fuku if I'm not too hungry or craving some sushi and fish for cheap. In addition, it's usually a lot emptier than Oishii; I never see more than two tables occupied, so seating is never a problem.",

The amount of rice is 2 or 3 times what it should be for the amount of meat they give you. They don't give you that much avocado either. Don't get me wrong- they're plenty generous when it comes to cucumber but that just doesn't cut it for me.   I think I've become jaded. I came here on the day it opened (i had subscribed to their fb page in extreme anticipation since i had first heard about it) and it was really nice to see such a modern interior in beautiful red and black. Maybe they DID give out more meat on that day. I also liked the sauces the guy recommended...an unexpected blend of eel sauce and creamy miso? And the free nori chips they were handing out were really yummy too. But alas, I'm not sure If i'm going back for bowls anymore. Maybe rolls, since the rice is rolled up and doesn't dwarf the meat/veggies. Or maybe I should just stop whining and pay the extra $2 for more salmon.",

So pick a protein, some add-ons, a sauce and a type of rice, and throw it all together in a bowl or a roll (yes, it rhymes, and yes, you can't walk 2 feet in the place without being reminded of it).  It's not bad, but once the limited novelty wears off, that's about all you can say of the place.

The concept is great, the sushi is (at least both times I went) consistently adequate (I mean, this isn't Masa, so don't expect a life-changing experience, just a solid one), the veggies are fresh, and the sauces are delicious (not all spicy mayos are created equal, and this one reigns supreme). On top of that, I enjoy their miso soup.   Would that every city had a place like this. The concept (being able to take any sushi roll and turn it into a chirashi bowl or a salad, depending on your mood, OR being able to create your own roll/bowl by choosing from an ample list of fresh ingredients) is what makes it stand out from other fast-food-sushi joints. Love it, hope it franchises further north.",

I wish they'd add more toppings, though; with the bowls, there seems to be too much rice (or lettuce) for the amount of toppings. The rice in the bowls is their sushi rice, so it has a hint of flavor, which I enjoy. Overall, it's decent food, and I like the style of the shop.

I found Sushi Fuku on Yelp when my boyfriend and I were looking for a new sushi place to try out because our regular spot was closed for a special event. I was very surprised when we walked in because I was not expecting the Chipotlesque atmosphere at all. I was super impressed by the concept, selection and aesthetics. Where else can you have a sushi burrito or do a make your own roll? Awesome. We were not aware that the portions were larger than your average sushi eatery, so I ordered a Twin City roll and a Teriyaki Chicken Bowl. The prices were pretty low, so I figured that most people ordered several items. I was wrong. The portions were huge and even someone with as robust an appetite as I have should likely start off with one item (granted, I had just eaten ice cream prior to going for sushi).   The fish used in the roll (salmon/tuna) seemed fresh and the portion was decent, but when I started eating it, I just wasn't impressed. It wasn't NOT fresh, but it wasn't trying to swim around on my plate either, if you catch my drift. I found the seaweed wrapper to be extremely gummy with an unpleasant, overpowering flavor. I can't really put my finger on it because the roll wasn't awful, but I just didn't like it very much. My boyfriend ordered a rainbow roll and a golden dragon roll and felt the same way about his. I took a bite of the golden dragon roll and liked the crunch of the shrimp tempura (not soggy at all, which is good!). Unfortunately, the chicken teriyaki bowl was terrible. The \"chicken\" was either super low quality thigh meat or various chicken organs. It was chewy and gross. The veggies tasted too floral (the carrots literally tasted like lavender or something, which was weird) and the sauce did not taste like teriyaki sauce. One star for the chicken teriyaki bowl.   The service was quick and helpful and someone who I assume was the owner came over to chat with us (joking about how our eyes were bigger than our stomachs!), which I liked. The tables were clean and the condiments/utensils bar well-stocked. I was not impressed with the food at Sushi Fuku, but would be willing to give it another go and try different menu items if I'm in the area.",

They have a very unique \"Americanized\" selection of sushi that includes things like fried chicken or steak, which sound really weird at first, but are surprisingly delicious as sushi. You can choose between a soy wrap/seaweed wrap and white/brown rice. You also have the option to make your own sushi.  At first it may seem a little pricey, but you get a roll (10 LARGE pieces) of sushi and it's pretty worth the price. Everything is always made very quickly and the staff are patient and friendly. My favorite is the Korean sushi with steak and kimchi.   They have drinks, side dishes (like miso soup and kimchi) and mochi ice cream. Although I haven't tried the sides, and I'm not sure how many mochi you get, $1.50 for mochi ice cream isn't too bad--especially you can't really find it anywhere else in Oakland. Their drinks are a bit overpriced, but again, you can't really find ramune (Japanese soda) and brands of Japanese green tea unless you go to Asian markets in the Strip.",

Watching the sushi chef make the cuts is part of the experience. Since it's cheap, and all the ingredients that will go into your roll is already prepared similar to Subway and Chipotle--it's a good deal.  I like salmon, brown rice, with tamago, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo sauce on the side. And if I feel like paying $2 extra that day, the fish eggs (masago).   A warning about customizing your own roll-- **IT MIGHT NOT TASTE GOOD** Know what you're asking them to put in your roll. I made this mistake when I wanted to add everything that I liked, which basically taught me how kimchi doesn't taste great with everything.  If you've been reading the other reviews, yes, this place is very \"Americanized.\" They have a menu of uncommon ingredients such as bacon, (cold) chicken, and steak. English translations are also next to the Japanese names. They have quite a few original rolls with interesting combinations--Pittsburgh Roll, Oakland Roll, Twin City Roll, etc.   I always appreciate a sanitary restaurant. It's really clean with someone always cleaning the table and rearranging the chairs after a party leaves.",

There are a few other customizations available, but basically that's it. Could it be any more like Chipotle?  Verdict: we loved it. I had a tuna and salmon bowl (it's a few bucks to get two meats) and my kiddo had a tuna roll. The rolls are enormous so she only finished 7/10 pieces. I finished about 5/6 of my bowl. The kiddo did have a bit of a problem with the size of the sushi pieces. She had to take multiple bites of each one so some of them fall apart. She's used to her food falling apart so she didn't mind, but I can see being annoyed by that.  Incidentally, I am adding the \"rice spreading machine\" and roll cutting machine\" to my Christmas list. Quite cool.  Next time I'd like to try the cooked chicken and have a warm bowl.",

This place has everything you could want in a restaurant - tons of options, huge proportions, great prices, friendly staff and a banging rewards program. I have been going to Sushi Fuku since it opened and I have learned to really love the place. The environment is clean and welcoming and the people are so awesome. Whether you are a first time visitor or a seasoned resident of Oakland, you need to stop in.  When you are ordering, you will see that you can completely customize the sushi roll exactly as you want it. If you're not sure what goes well together, they give you a few signature roll ideas on their menu. (Tip: if you are torn between two different rolls, they will let you do half and half!) The place has a very modern feel, one machine lays the rice on the seaweed wrap and then a different machine cuts the roll into perfect pieces for you at the end. Did I mention the proportions too? I have never gotten this much sushi for the low prices that Fuku offers. The rolls are massive; I feel super satisfied having a roll for dinner.   When paying, you can sign up/use the rewards program that Sushi Fuku uses. This card is free to all customers. It is also extremely convenient because other places in Oakland use the same program; once you sign up at one of the locations, you are set for all the other rewards programs too! As you keep going back to Sushi Fuku, as I suspect you will, you will earn points towards free things like drinks, sushi rolls or t-shirts!!   Lastly, all the employees are super friendly. No matter what mood I am, I leave with a smile on my face. They truly make Sushi Fuku a fun place to eat. Make sure you stop in and make Sushi Fuku your next favorite restaurant!!",
