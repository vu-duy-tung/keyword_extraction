Their food is definitely on the awesome end of the spectrum when it comes to brewpubs. They have the usual pizza and wings, but everything has a twist toward the higher, healthier end.  The fried cheese curds, though maybe not healthier, are hand breaded and flash fried for a very melty and flacky basket of breaded amazingness. That paired well with my \"Aufstand w/ Blueberries\" which was a very bright, fruity Berliner Weiss.  This place has a lot of potential to expand their style into the city. They're doing a great job, and I'd highly recommend taking the drive out to have a beer.",

The people working here are super friendly and fun.  Oh, and you pretty much sit right next to all the brewing equipment. This is my local go-to spot. Definitely recommended!!!",

    "text": "Insurrection does it right!  With so many craft breweries popping up in Pittsburgh this should be on your 'to do' list.   They make small batch craft beers and are always making something new.  They had a nice double IPA, a Gose a Farmhouse ale and American wild ale to name a few.  I've been to most of the breweries in the area (about a dozen) and this is one of the best!  Definitely some of the best quality beers around.  The place is new and very nice and clean inside.  Nice layout with a kitchen and bar on one side, tables in the middle and the Beer kettles on the end.  They also have a nice open out door shaded patio.  Also I like that they are open at noon on a Friday as most others don't open till 4 PM.  I didn't have the food but they had a nice selection on the menu is constantly updated and changing.",

    "text": "Spent most of my Saturday evening here with friends this past weekend and we had a fantastic time! The weather was beautiful; they had their garage doors open in the back and the laid back atmosphere was exactly what we needed. Since we had a large group, we all met fairly early to make sure we had a table. It's a small place with only a few tables and a bar. By the time we left it was extremely crowded, so arrive early if you want a table.   With a large group, we were able to try a lot of what they had on the menu both in terms of beer and food. I understand they change their beer selection often, but I sampled The Invisible Swordsman which was a wheat American Ale and it was excellent. Everyone else in the party enjoyed Mosaic and Pretty Hop Machine. We were also thrilled to find out they have several wines from Pittsburgh Winery on the menu.   Aside from the great beer, their charcuterie menu is reason enough to stop here. They have an impressive list of various meats (many of them Parma) and cheeses to sample. Our party of 8 went through two large platters without shame. We also shared some snacks from the menu - the arancini, the pork meatballs and the short rib mac and cheese. The arancini (2 in a serving) was pretty good, although the marinara sauce served with it left a lot to be desired. The pork meatballs (2) were served with a tangy bbq sauce and also were quite good. I highly recommend the short rib mac and cheese. I wish there would've been a bit more short rib, but it was still a great dish to share. They also have salads, wings and several sandwich options - many of them using the meats and cheeses from the charcuterie menu.   Everyone in our party agreed this was a solid local spot to spend our Saturday evening. We hogged the table for quite some time, but our server was extremely friendly and accommodating for our group the entire time. As previous reviews mentioned, it is next door to the police station, but we all took Uber or Lyft so no need to worry! We'll certainly be back!",

I loved the half pours because they gave me the option to try a large amount of the beer list without having too much.  They do 1/2 pours instead of flights.  So don't be disappointed if there are no flights, because the 1/2 pours are perfect....you can try so much more!  It wasn't overly crowded and the service was on point.  The cheese and meat board was a nice size and you can choose your own.  The wings were also pretty good.  The place is the start to something wonderful.    There is street parking only, so take it when you can get it!  Also, although the street sign says East Railroad Street, those of us from the South Hills know this road as Washington Pike coming from Bridgeville and Washington Ave coming from Carnegie.  I'm not really sure why the township renamed this road East Railroad Street because it parallels West Railroad Street.  As a person in the map making field....this is really odd.  You don't usually have east & west road names parallel to each other.   So just be aware, this is on the main drag.",

We got there just in time before the crowd arrived on a Friday night and I'm so glad we did. The beers were good, I tried 4 (I think?) and there was only 1 that I wasn't a fan of and it wasn't even that bad. The food was also very good. We had wings, a pizza, and some sliders. Definitely too much food, but everything had alot of flavor and came fairly quickly. I will say that the service here was on top of it, they managed the increasingly busy dining room like champs and never let their tables sit for too long without checking on them. Seating is kind of limited, so I'd recommend going earlier in the evening if you don't want to wait. (I'm hoping their new addition includes more seating!)",

    "text": "Loved it!  Finally made my way out to Heidelberg to support this new great local brewery.  We went on a Saturday early afternoon, so parking wasn't an issue.  The inside is very lovely, all very modern and clean.  Even though parking wasn't an issue, the place was packed.  There wasn't a table or barstool open.  There was a small bar that is further down the hall from the main bar that you can sit at, but it is isolated from the rest of the patrons.  After securing our drinks we made our way down to the only open spots, the bar in the hallway.  Lucky for us, a couple was leaving just about 5 minutes into our stay.  Matt the one owner, quickly flagged us to have a seat.    Once at the bar we procured a menu.  They have quite a Cheese & Charcuterie selection.  That alone took an entire page of options.  The rest of their menu is small but in a good way, the way you know they sell what's good and what works.  Lucky for us they were offering a Lenten special.  You have your choice of a grilled salmon or grouper and it came with housemade chips and mac n cheese.  I ordered the grouper and made a special request to swap the chips and pasta for a side salad.  Have to save my calories for the important things like several more drinks.  When it came out they were on buns, but the menu didn't state they were sandwiches. I wish it did because I wasted their bun as the fish was perfect without it.  Nice thick portion, grilled perfectly.  The salad was an array of mixed greens and veg with a housemade balsamic.  Food was great, as was the beer, and the price was on point.    After a couple more rounds, Brad the other owner made his way in and we had a chance to talk and see how everything was going.  From my personal perspective it all seemed very successful to me.  He confirmed they have been doing well and even had to close one week because they ran out of beer.  I am super happy this place is doing well and is so awesome.  I hope at some point they are able to add on, specifically an outside area, which would be great in the summer.  Either way, I can't wait to come back.",

Brain Bucket and Gunga Galunga are also delish. No food this visit but definitely next time around.",

I walked in and I could smell they just brewed that day, I LOVE THAT AROMA!! I sat at the bar and waited a minute or two and the bartender asked me what I will have. I asked for a food menu and she obliged. I saw they had an extensive cheese menu, cool I thought.  I got a beer and it was average, I ordered a cheese platter and another beer that would fit the profile.  I must say, this is the first experience that a brewpub had such a cheese list, I was happy. However the beer is just average, I got to pale ales, hopped differently. They need some brown ales and some lighter beers to fit the cheese menu.  All in all, I will definitely be back. I hope they can improve the beer.  Edited Review: I have stopped in here since then & unfortunately their beers haven't changed much. Same malt base, different hops. I dropped it one star for that fact.",

I like how you can choose to have a half pour rather than a full. The food menu is concise and specific. We tried two different types of meat and cheeses which were presented on a butcher block cutting board with fresh bread and mustard. I had the cranberry mead which was very tasty! Didn't even taste like beer to me, which I like since I'm not a huge beer person. My fiance loved all the beers he tried, and he is a beer guy! Matt, the owner, is very hands on and friendly. The other staff is also friendly and helpful. You can tell they're happy working there.   Main course... I had the mac n cheese with chorizo, it was very good! The fiance had the dolphin steak sandwich with fresh chips which I stole of course!   Overall, a nice place for apps and beer in an area I would not normally go to. Looking forward to my next visit.",

The place is small and the outside area is completely closed with some overhead heaters.  The menu is a little different than my last visit.  Ordered the Sausage pizza that has posted jalapeno, banana and green peppers with Parma Mild Italian Sausage that is cooked in a wood fired pizza oven.  The pizza was very good with a spiciness from the peppers.  The crust is a little thicker, not paper thin and very tasty.  Great with one of their beers.",

Appetizers of fried cheese curds, which were delicious!!!!! Light crunchy batter, top quality stringy cheese, dipped in Ranch dressing, again, delicious!!!! An order of Garlic butter wings, again the coating was crunchy, plenty of Garlic and butter, really good!!! An order of Scorpion BBQ wings, sauce was decent, about a 6-7 out of 10 on the heat scale, good crunchy wings. A spicy Italian hoagie for dinner, a generous portion of Italian meats, fresh cut mozzarella on a fresh Italian roll, what you expect of a good Italian hoagie!!!! A side of decent Mac and Cheese rounded out a great meal. Two local microbrews to wash it down, definitely will go back!!! Great little place in Heidelberg!!!! I'm not a big connoisseur of beer, that's why I included a picture of their beers. Stop in and enjoy!!!",

The waitress barely checked on us however it was busy and looked like she was the only one waiting tables so not a huge deal but could of been better. Now let's talk food...they have wood fired pizzas! My boyfriend and I shared the Margherita pizza, Amazing! I loved it and it was a great size to share. Our friends got buffalo wings which smelled really good so we had to get some to go before we left. I'm so glad we did because they were also delicious, prob the best buffalo sauce I've had in a while. We also got the dry rub wings and they were seasoned really well. I don't usually love dry rub wings but I was surprised at how good they were. I'm a cheese lover so I was really excited that they offer a big selection of cheeses and meats to make your own cheese and charcuterie board however the list was overwhelming. I was unsure of what to choose so I didn't get any but I saw one come out of the kitchen and it looked great so I will be back to try. They have about 7 different beers so you will def be able to find one you like. 2 weeks was my favorite.",

    "text": "Really interesting & very busy new brewery in Heidelberg. It was our 3rd stop on a Saturday South Hills brewery adventure so we were pretty excited to see they offered half pours of all their beers. Since it's literally next door to the Heidelberg Police Station, half pours seemed prudent.   Loved the Suppression #3 Double IPA (I wasn't driving!). My husband had the Stealing Hoppy Hours American IPA. Both were really delicious.   We'd already eaten but the food coming out of the kitchen, especially the wings, looked and smelled delicious. Don't be surprised if you see several policemen in there sampling those wings!!! I know we'll be saving room for them next time.",

But with street parking and the police right there, it sort of discourages anyone who didn't walk there to go slow. Sometimes I don't want to go slow, if you know what I mean. But it is what it is. Just be warned. The space itself is nice! Small, cozy in fact. You walk down the stairs from street level and along a hallway to the bar. Nice clean and modern bathrooms too. I liked the feel of the place and even though it was packed, I felt like I could have stayed for a while (except I was driving - note the warning above!). The beer menu was enticing on all fronts and included about 6-7 beers and even some Apis Mead. I was able to order half pours (NICE!) and get a decent sample that way. The Stealing Hoppy Hours IPA was very tasty indeed.   We saw a lot of food come out while we sat there and man, those wings looked good and smelled heavenly. If we hadn't had that pizza at Spoonwood and that Jerky at Hitchhiker, I would have indulged! Maybe next time.",

Their weekend specials are always perfect, the chipotle chicken tacos might be the best tacos I've ever had. Soups are also really tasty. Sandwiches, a hearty yes. Homemade chips, thumbs up. It's all so. good. The service is great as well. Insurrection's beers are really tasty too, don't get me wrong (pink lemonade pants and blueberry merph are my faves), but my husband and I go here for the food.

My husband took me here as part of a date night and I honestly felt like I was being transported back to my early college days, and not in a good way, ha!  From the seat yourself sign and basic, cheap tableware, to the mediocre service and sub-par pizza, I felt like I was 21 again. The only difference between then and now is I wouldn't have been able to afford the $80 price tag on some pizza and beers back in the day.   The beers, while limited in selection, were fine, but my husband's specialty cocktail was so bad, he wouldn't even finish it. At a gourmet pizza price tag, I expected a lot more from their pizzas. Unfortunately, my veggie pizza left a lot to be desired and my husband's pizza had an odd, metallic taste to it. We also got fried cheese poppers and they tasted good, but again, it felt like something I'd get at a bowling alley or college bar. It was not worth the 10 dollar price tag!   Overall, I think there are other breweries in the Pittsburgh vicinity that serve better beer, and you can find better quality pizza elsewhere, so I'd save yourself the trip out here and find somewhere else to enjoy that pint and pizza.",

    "text": "I stopped by here 2 Sundays ago with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We headed to Insurrection Ale works because we were looking for a brewery with food and I have had it bookmarked in Yelp for a long time.  It's located right on the Main Street in Heidelberg and so it was easy to find.  We headed in through the main door and went down a few steps to get into the brewery.  While walking down a hall to the dining room we could see some of their brewing equipment off to right.  The dining room itself consisted of a bar and an area which I am going to say used to be a patio but is now enclosed with plastic.  They have heat lamps for whenever it's cold and I imagine they can open some of it up whenever it's warm in the summer.  As I often do whenever I visit a new brewery, I decided to have a flight here.  The only problem with that is that they didn't necessarily have flights although they do have 5 oz tasters that you can order.  So I ended up making my own flight by ordering 4 of the 5 oz tasters.  The beers I chose were the panama red (hoppy red ale), total stealth (IPA), double secret (DIPA) and Springs in the floor (APA).  Out of the bunch I liked the Panama Red the most due to the brightness the hops brought the red ale and then liked the Springs in the floor the least.  For my entree I ordered one of their specials for the day which was the short rib confit taco.  The menu said it was short rib braised in rendered duck fat and their pale ale topped with fire roasted pineapple slaw, hot pepper relish, Romano and Parmesan cheese.  Our food here took quite awhile to get to us.  Our server actually came back and confirmed our order about 10 minutes after we had put in it to begin with and then after a somewhat long wait my wife's food was about 5 minutes behind the rest of the tables.  It didn't bother us as we were busy sharing vacation pictures but they still took care of us without us saying anything about it.  In any case I thought that my tacos were delicious.  The meat was moist and tender while the pineapple added some sweetness and the relish gave it a nice and spicy kick.  For someone like myself it was quite the well conceived dish as it ticked off the savory, sweet and spicy boxes.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Even though the food took quite awhile to get to us I found it to be really good and their beers decent as well.",

We were hungry and on our way home back from a night at Wheeling so we knew we had to stop by.  The last time we were here we didn't order off of their main menu.  It was around Lent and we got their special that was a grilled Salmon.  It was great.  This time we studied the menu on our way here and had some ideas on what we were going to order.         When we got here they went over their specials for the day and they were really intriguing.  I ended up ordering their brisket tacos off of their specials for the day menu. Oh my they were mouthwatering.  I could have eaten 4 of those and axed the chips.  I ordered a good wheat beer here and my wife got a IPA.  The beer is very good and it just keeps getting better.  Matt and Brad know what they are doing here and I know they will be setting the bar even higher the next time we visit.  Too bad they aren't closer for us or we would be here weekly.  If you haven't tried out Insurrection yet or if you haven't been there in a while make sure to stop by soon.  Great beer and great food!",

Pizzas have a crispy crust that's not too thin, topped with interesting combinations. My last pizza had speck (German prosciutto) with pickled shallots and fontina cheese. Wings come out, like they should, with crispy skin.   The patty melt special the other day was reimagined with caramelized onions, Brie cheese and a banana pepper relish. It had all of what one loves in a patty melt- toasted bread with a gooey inside.   Food prices are a bit high for bar fare. But I don't mind paying more for quality and consistency.  Beers here skew toward IPAs. I have also tasted very good coffee stouts and a couple sours.   The service here is friendly but can get slammed very quickly as the place fills up. Seems like they keep the number of servers at bare minimum to function. The kitchen does keep pace with the food once the order is in. So things might get slow if it is packed. But first class service is not why I come to a place like this.   My suggestion is kick back, knock a couple back and enjoy the rare combination of great beer and inventive bar food.",

As soon as we sat down I understood why they were the only seats open. This drunk old man started tapping my mom and kept trying to get her attention. She couldn't understand anything he was saying but he continued to bother my mom and eventually stood up and was hardly an inch away from her. I told him to back off and leave us alone. He then continued to mock us. Thankfully the bartender noticed and told him to leave. We really appreciated it. It definitely put a damper in the night because that went on for half the time we were there and made us feel very uncomfortable but once he left we were able to enjoy ourselves.",

My favorite was the mujer del espacio, a juicy tasting pale ale and my friend loved her pastiche, lemongrass flavored ale.  The best part of our visit was definitely the Italian pizza...  I will definitely be back to try some of the other food. The toppings, crust, and sauce were all perfect.",

I came here on a Friday night and while there were many patrons, the space was reasonably sized so my large group didn't have to wait around for open seats. We ordered the AleWorks wings and the cheese curds as snacks. The food was the bomb and I would even consider coming back just for the food. The Aleworks wing sauce was a combination of sweet and spicy and it was such a wonderful complement to the wings. The cheese curds were crispy on the outside and melty on the inside. My favorite part of the cheese curds was the light flavoring in the batter that made them perfect without any dipping sauce. However, dipped in ranch elevated them to another level! I also very much enjoyed my drinks and love that they serve other local beverages (cider/mead/cocktails) and not just the beers they brew.   With such a great experience, I definitely will be back to try more items from their menu!",

They have a few pages of the menu dedicated to charcuterie options (complete with flavor descriptions) and you can mix and match to create your own charcuterie board. The food is decent; I wasn't too impressed with the pizza, but the sandwiches have not disappointed. I have yet to try any of the weekend specials but I've seen some mouthwatering descriptions on the specials menu and on their social media pages. This place is pretty tiny, so best bet is to get there early or during an off-peak time to get a seat.",

Our service could have been more attentive, but it was crowded and there only seemed to be one wait staff member working at the time. Maybe that was an anomaly.  Beer selection rotates from week to week, but they make a lot of good stuff here. The Pebbles and Marbles IPA was my favorite of the night  The food is farm to table with high quality ingredients. We tried some wings with Aleworks sauce (sweet and hot), fried cheese curds, and the pizza with pickled shallot and speck. Everything was great. Would like to come back for the wild boar meatballs next time. They specialize in charcuterie so make sure you take a look at that as well.  I enjoyed it here.

The cider was good but I only got two because drinks are expensive of course. Food is average price and tasted pretty good. My friend ordered the pizza and they have a nice selection. She enjoyed it.

We started with a group of about 8 people, but our group progressively got larger over the two hour span that we were there. We ended up with a party of 20, and our waitress, Diane, was extremely accommodating and friendly! She helped us put tables together each time more people came and was a FABULOUS waitress. My drink was never empty and she was always checking up on us.   I don't drink beer, but I was happy to find out that they had a cinnamon cider on tap. The cider was absolutely delicious. My fiance tried two different beers and said that they were O.K. We didn't order any food, but we did try the wings from a friends which were delicious!   Overall, this brewery has a nice, relaxing ambiance. The staff is very friendly and the drinks very good! It is a bit pricey, but that's what you usually encounter at breweries.",

At this point we've been to Insurrection more times than I can count on my hand and it's just consistent good experiences every. single. time.",

This place is FANTASTIC! 10 rotating beers on tap, and by checking out the previous reviews it looks like they rotate often.  We ordered a margarita pizza and buffalo wings, and omg were they delicious.... so delicious, we had to place another order of wings!  We sat at a table that was close to the kitchen, so we got to see all of the food that was coming out; everything looked incredible! I must try a sandwich next time!  The staff was nice and the place was clean and trendy looking. Lots of outside seating for warm weather. I can't wait to go back!!",

I had the chorizo tacos, which did not live up to their price (two small soft shells, chorizo is dry and low on flavor compared to most chorizo, plus some chips, for about $14--compare with say Condado tacos, where you pay $9 for a set of two tacos that are much better, and that's already not cheap, but in line with top quality). However, the other food items may live up (it looked that way, but I was still hungry after that appetizer-like set of tacos. I will try something else to eat next time, and will probably be able to kick it up to five stars).",

As a result, seating was sparse and it took a little while to reach the bartender for our drink orders.   Once we grabbed our beers, we sat near the entrance in the leather sofas (which actually worked out well as we avoided the noise/crowd and had comfier places to sit). We ordered the Phantom Limb and Dark Star Crashes. Both were pretty good!  We also decided we wanted to order some appetizers from their food menu. I waited for a bit at the bar until a gentleman came over to ask if I had been helped. I said no and that I wanted to place a food order. I ordered a set of buffalo wings and inquired about the BBQ sliders as it did not indicate how many it came with. He said there were three and I asked how much it would cost to add another one (since we had four people). He said he would give it to me for free since I had stood there waiting so long and because we had to sit at the entrance. That was really awesome and the food was actually pretty tasty!   Definitely a place to check out if you're in Heidelberg. Just beware they may be busy at peak hours and parking can be a bit of a struggle.",

Started with goat cheese and ginger on warm toasted ciabatta. King pearl salad with lemon vinaigrette and cashews was unique and super fresh. Margherita Pizza was delicious. Had three kind of wings - butter garlic, buffalo and Aleworks which was sweet and spicy. All three were great!  Will definitely be back and will try the charcuterie!",

I was disappointed they didn't offer a flight option but they did let me taste a few so I could decide what I wanted.  The food was also decent, but not amazing.  I was really excited about the meatballs stuffed with cheese, but sadly they must have forgotten to stuff it with cheese :(  The service was the part that was most lacking. I called the meatball issue to the attention of the waitress but she didn't seem concerned and just walked off, not to return again.   I would've been ok if they would have just brought some cheese to put on top at least.  She also forgot one of our drink orders we had to remind her of, then she still brought the wrong thing even though she had written down the original order.We had to get her attention many times before she could finally bring the check. It took about 30 min from when we first asked her to finally get it.  She seemed to have trouble using the machine to check us out and there was only one machine that could be used at a time.  She didn't apologize at all (not about the meatballs lacking cheese or about the delays or forgotten drink orders) until the very end when she finally produced the check and she took the meatballs off of it.  I know it was their opening day though so they are probably still working out some kinks, so I still hope to go back and see how they do.",

The beer poured at this fine pourary has made me, a boy that is pour, a rich man. No longer is Heidelberg a draft beer dessert. This is important to me because the trek is relatively short and these fine pours are long and complete. Right out my back door, I can get a brewed pour! Bottled beer everywhere around me, but only pours to drink at this pourary. Four score and seven pours ago muzzys II was the only pour, not anymore! Poured True and complete with depth and color. Pours that will leave you wanting more and more. A place for friends to relax and enjoy. A half, a full, or more they pour. Bring your growler and really get 64oz pour! No longer is a half pour half empty, but it has become half full! Through a pour, a pour boy has become a rich man. I was once that very pour boy, but I am now a rich full bodied draft drinking man!!!! No longer is a pour trapped in a glass bottle or can, beer runs though this place like water only usually can! The pour has been freed from bottles and cans!",

I really enjoyed the dark star beer, I would have to say it was my favorite one of the night. They have some unique beers available and I'm excited to see what else they will have available in the future. Since this was their first day of service being open to the public-I felt that service was okay. Our server wasn't super knowledgeable about the beers and even though she wrote our orders down-she kept forgetting what we ordered. The food menu looks good-my friends ordered wings and they looked tasty-they even have a ghost pepper sauce for their wings that I can't wait to try! I will come back and give Insurrection another try as I always love to support local breweries-but it will probably not be for awhile in order to give them time to work on their execution and service.",
