They have a huge menu with so many options of not only breakfast items but lunch items as well. I've been to other breakfast places that are so busy and filled up it's a little intimidating! It wasn't all that busy today, but they of course have a good turn out for a newer diner! The price is very reasonable and the food is very fresh! This is a great add to Brownsville road! Very convenient location!",

The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the service and quality of food you receive. When it's nice out you can sit outside, or sit inside and enjoy the sunlight as they open the garage door at the front of the restaurant.  This place is BYOB and also have a BYOB Bloody Mary Bar on Sundays (this is something you never find)!  I have ordered a different item off the menu all three visits and I would re-order and recommend all three (corned beef hash, breakfast burrito, chicken and eggs).  I cannot wait to go again on Sunday!",

    "text": "We want to like this place, we really do. It's within walking distance from our house and has been nicely updated. Not to mention it's a small business. I'd much rather support and contribute my money to places like this than a chain.   That being said, today was our third time here since they opened. We waited for an unusually long period of time, given the availability of tables and staff, which has been par for the course here.   It took about 15 minutes to be seated, 20 minutes for my daughter's waffles to come out and ANOTHER 25 MINUTES for our other three entrees. Both my other daughter and fiancee had hot dogs which were both overcooked. My daughter's hot dog was supposed to be bacon wrapped. It wasn't. To remedy, they brought a side of crispy bacon 10 minutes later.   While I felt bad for the server being caught in the crossfire, every time she came over and our food wasn't out yet, we got a dirty look. Later, when apologizing for the wait, she called the cook out by name. While I agree, most of this was the kitchen's fault, that was pretty unprofessional. Other tables that came in after us got their food first and not a SINGLE table had their food brought out together. It was a mess.   The manager came over and ended up asking my advice and who's fault I thought it was after divulging that I worked for years as a server. A little unnerving and again, unprofessional.   We ended up with a discount and a lot of dessert they comped us to go, but it was too little, too late, for us.   We got the feeling there was a lot of inner conflict and nepotism going on here which is a perfect example of why business and family should never mix.",

Have been there several times for breakfast, never an extended wait, servers are super friendly, food is fresh, eggs NOT cooked in a vat of grease (thank you), French toast is devine, and although their iced coffee comes from a concentrate, I fell in love with it. This is one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been. My only complaint is that they don't do a bigger dinner menu, I'd love to see them do Farm to Table entrees with substance.",

The waitress was horrible, she messed up the order and never came to refill any drinks. When she did come, it was to give us the bill and quickly ask us how the food tasted and literally started running away before we could answer. The food was below average and a bit soggy. It's sad because I'd like to support my local businesses, but I can't say I'll be going back.",

They have refined their eggs Benedict recipe, The Cracked Arnold, to where it is a bout the best I've ever tasted.  Of course the corn beef hash is great too.  Its hard to go wrong with almost anything on their menu.  On weekends it gets a little crowded as all restaurants do, so if you want no wait and faster than usual service, stop in during the week.  Still for how crowded it is the weekend service is still pretty good, and the food more than makes up for it.",

Our server, Danielle, greeted us immediately and took good care of us while we were there.  I can't complain about the service at all.  I got the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry syrup.  I tasted neither lemon nor ricotta in the pancakes and the blueberry syrup tasted bitter and burnt...maybe it's just my tastebuds.  My husband ordered the 'Release the Crack'n' which was a little bit of everything - pancakes, eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon.  He thought his meal was quite good.  I was slightly put off by the music though.  The music playing in the restaurant was loud and very, very Christian.  Perhaps this doesn't bother most, but it was off-putting to us.  I don't mind a little background music while I eat, but I never like it loud enough to notice.  This was our first time so I'm not sure if this is an all the time thing or just the choice of a specific person this particular day.  Our meals with coffee were around $30, which was a little steep but we received plenty of food and were full all day.",

Really, I don't mind salt, but this was insane.   My wife got eggs Benedict type thing and the eggs were way over cooked. It was supposed to come with sliced mozzarella but they left it out.

There is a \"breakfast bar \" type counter where you can sit or their is a large dining room. Everything is new, fresh, and clean. Its contemporary yet home-y.  I ordered the waffles. They come with 2 eggs and a breakfast meat. I gave my son the eggs. I ordered bacon as my meat. The waffles were crispy on the edges which is how I like them. The bacon was a little crispy and the saltiness wasn't overwhelming. The sweet of the waffles with the saltiness of the bacon was a great bite.  My son ordered blueberry pancakes. He chose bacon as his breakfast meat. The pancakes were full of blueberries. They were fantastic.  I think we just found a new breakfast place. They also serve lunch and dinner. I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes.",

    "text": "Overall Impression: A well-themed BYOB breakfast joint in Brentwood that has twists on breakfast classics, is moderately priced, and uses quality ingredients. The orange cloth napkins are just a bonus!  The Food: I don't know what more you could ask for--because they allow you to BYOB for Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's and have literal BUCKETS of bacon. Those two factors alone should make you want to high-tail it in there. My boyfriend and I frequent this place on weekends for breakfast, as he lives right down the road, and we've never been disappointed. I'm a chicken and gravy fan, so I usually order the \"Chicken and the Egg\" with my eggs over-easy with mini potato pancakes. The fried chicken tenders are decent although you may want to order extra gravy, it's a little skimpy for True gravy fans. The eggs are cooked exactly how you want them and the mini potato pancakes are perfectly seasoned. The boyfriend usually goes for the Eastwood omelet and adds ghost pepper cheese for an extra kick, and the eggs are fluffy and generously-filled. There is always ample toast and coffee creamer. The menu allows you to BYO-omelet, has a wide variety of choice, and even names a local sandwich, \"The Brentwood Duke,\" as unique to the local area. There is little left to be desired with so much quality and variety attached--not to mention there's eggs on almost all breakfast dishes in a multitude of ways.  The Restaurant: I can only describe it as a quaint modern diner with an upscale twist. They use bright orange, green, and splashes of red to give a positive, fresh feeling, and they try keep a spacey feel to a rather cramped space. The ladies at the seating area are always pleasant, and you can choose to sit at the bar or within the restaurant--we prefer to sit at the bar, as there's more space to eat. The only aspect of this location that is borderline obnoxious is how small the tables are combined with how much stuff they try to stick on them (advertising, eating accoutrements, trash bucket, etc.), but I understand that they wanted to fit as many tables/booths as they could to their small space--maybe just nix the extra bits on the table? Between both of our breakfast plates and another plate in the middle of a shared waffle, we were accidentally pushing each other's plates halfway off the table and had to put all the extra things on the floor. Beside the small table space, they make up for it with their high emphasis on service. Their waiters are always very attentive and quick to clear unneeded tableware/refill coffee and water. It does get a little pricey if you start to BYOB because they do charge a cork fee. We've easily paid $50 with tip for breakfast between the two of us, which is a little much to me, but the quality backs the price.  TL;DR: The best breakfast place in Brentwood area for sure, and definitely good enough to be within the top 10 for Pittsburgh. The next time you want a breakfast date, go here. You'll love it.",

The menu has a wide selection of breakfast and lunch items. I'd take off half a star if I could, mainly due to parking issues.  The prices are slightly higher than some breakfast places, but the quality is very high. We both ordered their Eastwood Omelet $9.99. It was a combination of cheese, onion, peppers, ham and bacon. The meats were of much higher quality than I expected. Great job! I would also recommend their cheesy potatoes. First Watch now has some serious competition for a place that specializes in breakfast. They offer limited outdoor seating,  but the interior is very homey. Service could not have been better. They have a loyalty program. We joined. Need I say more?",

I feel Saturday and Sunday is your prime chance to pump out your best dishes, not the b class to save time.   Each time I went, I felt very rushed, despite the restaurant not appearing busy. This is very annoying to the point where you are asked if you have decided 3-4 times within two minutes of sitting down. Maybe this is a tactic to rush people before they have a chance to realize nothing amazing is on the menu.   Each time, I have ordered a coffee - each time, the cup had old coffee stains on it which is disgusting.   Onto the food: I have tried the breakfast pizza, which sounds like a light, fresh spin on breakfast. However, this dish was LOADED with olives and easily became overly salty. I actually felt a tad sick afterwards.  The second visit order was the chicken/ egg dish. You get two small chicken fingers that seemed just a tad overlooked. The marble rye toast and eggs were good enough. My main complaint with this order was with the side of \"potato pancakes\". They were smaller version of McDonald's hashbrowns.... Nowhere near what a potato pancake is supposed to be. They should just call them hashbrowns.   A friend ordered the cracked Arnold- they rated it mediocre.   This place could be good if the had better menus on Sundays and focused on improving their service and cleanliness.   Save yourself the disappointment and head to J. Ts diner a few doors down. They don't try to be as fancy, but they cook good meals.",

My pancakes were cold and hardened on top from being under a heat lamp, the potatoes were obviously scooped out of a huge pan that had been sitting all day and were definitely not fresh, my toast was stale. My boyfriend was missing his coleslaw which when we finally received it was warm and his fries were only warm on the outside and still somewhat cold and frozen inside.

Right across from the giant eagle on Brownsville road, it's easy to get to with plenty of parking on street and around the corner. Lots of space inside with a cool set up. The menu is awesome with great breakfast items and lunch meals. We had the grilled chicken sandwich and the tomato basil soup. Soup is made fresh and it's excellent. The breakfast menu had plenty of options as well as daily specials. The day we were there they had a smores pancake that looked amazing!!! We will be back... Often",

Today was our third time here and the service continues to get worse & worse. Our server today Jules was the epitome of atrocious.   If I was dying of thirst, I would of shriveled up and died. I got one refill of water after begging for it. She never took our waters from our table to refill.   Then my wife asked for more sriracha honey sauce for her chicken & waffles, Jules never brought it. It seemed like she was avoiding us for some reason.   I'm not quite sure how this place works, but It doesn't seem like the servers have sections. Jules had tables outside, two tables right by the bar and tables in the back of the restaurant. How can a server possible be all over the restaurant and give good service.   And to recall our last visit I ordered a dish with a poached egg and it was hard inside. The server told me I was wrong and that's the way the egg was suppose to be. Well obviously she doesn't know what a poached egg is. How can you work at a bfast joint and not know what a poached eggs. The manager that day gave me 10% off my entree. Thanks for the $1.90 savings?!?!?  I really want to like this place the food is really good, but service is poor, it takes too long for the food to come out, it makes me not want to come back.   Crak'd egg thank you but no thanks",

My dad went to pick us up lunch from here about a week ago and they told him they don't serve grilled chicken or turkey sausage anymore. The turkey sausage I can understand if it isn't popular to save money but grilled chicken? That comes in some of my favorite and what I'm assuming so of the more popular entrees (grilled chicken salad, grilled chicken sandwich) etc. they still serve chicken but only fry it now, maybe it conserve it and save money, which I understand but I can't deny it's a bit of an inconvenience to people who prefer grilled. Overall it's still delicious food, but hopefully not much else will Change.",

We took our seats and the waitress came right over to ask for our drinks, I got a vanilla cold brew coffee and it was so good, dare I say better than Starbucks! I really appreciated how friendly and attentive our waitress was. I know from experience that being a waitress is a hard job. The menu had a great number of awesome sounding breakfasts. My boyfriend got the \"Release the Crackin\" which is basically a little bit of everything, and I got a biscuit and gravy with potato pancakes. My food was delicious, my boyfriend's meal was epic and looked freshly made. The pancakes were huge and a different texture from pancakes I've had but I really liked them!

I am not able to have cream as asked if she had soy or almond milk, unfortunately they didn't, but they said they would look into getting some next time and were so helpful providing me with alternative options. There specials each week are so tasty!!",

    "text": "The Crack'd Egg was more like a scrambled experience.  Once arriving, the hostess was outside having a conversation that the waitress openly admitted to us. They weren't sure what to do with us, only to eventually seat us. We waved this off as a weird fluke and tried to get on with the meal.  After getting seated, we realized that our table was a very awkward size. I was so far away from my dining partner that it was uncomfortable. Some of the seating is also on a higher level than the middle of the floor so I felt as if people were staring as me/our meal the entire time which was uncomfortable.  After ordering a tea and waiting on my deal, the chicken and the egg, a waitress spilled her tray of drinks which flung themselves far enough to also get on me more than the table at which she spilled at (higher level seating 1, me 0). I understand that mistakes happen, but at this point it just seemed like the whole staff was unsure about everything going on.  When the meals finally arrived they were okay but not great. I'm so glad that I asked for the gravy that came with my meal on the side as it was very heavy and I didn't end up using it at all. The chicken and eggs were tasty, but nothing to write home about. However, because the food was good and better than your average diner, I'm giving this place a 3 stars because of all the other awkwardness.",

Selections of breads to accompany and choices of potatoes makes me very happy on a Saturday AM drop-in.   While I haven't (yet) tried the waffles or pancakes, from a distance they look amazing! One of these options will definitely be my next morning fill up though it will be hard to veer from my love of omelettes.   Stop in and check this place out!",

The grilled cinnamon roll was really dry so we asked for extra icing to moisten it and again had the privilege of paying extra for it! Extremely disappointing.

My fiance had the biscuits and gravy and he liked it but again the portion was pretty small. It was not busy in there and the service was fast.

I visited on a Friday morning. It was busy but not too busy to be seated immediately. The service was quick and friendly. Surprisingly quick!! I ordered pumpkin coffee off their seasonal menu and that was great. Then I ordered chocolate chip pancakes and bacon.   This isn't your greasy diner type of place so that's why I'm excited to give it 5 stars. I'm happy to support a neighborhood gem that serves delicious breakfast food in a clean, upscale environment with friendly service and good prices.

The food was outstanding. Everything that was ordered in our party of 6 was top notch and we all licked our plates clean. Notables: My husband had the TOP O' THE MORNIN' Hash and I had THE CHICKEN & THE EGG. Amazing.   We left highly recommending this place to our local family who hadn't been before, and will definitely return whenever we're in town!!",

    "text": "We recently bought a business nearby and have been making early trips in, so this has become a regular spot for us. I've had the typical eggs bacon toast potato breakfast, the chicken fingers and gravy breakfast, the pecan praline pancakes...and who knows what else, but those are my faves.  Breakfast is hot! And not the kind of hot where the plates sit under heat lamps and wait for their server- but fresh hot! The service is genuinely friendly- like they really look pleasant and treat their customers like regulars. Even when we weren't at first.  I like sitting at the counter when it's my husband and I because the staff is so sweet to be around. But when they kids are with us, every table or booth is a good spot and they really treat our kids well. Oh and consistent is another word I would use. Always good food, solid service and an organized hostess. The bacon costumes help too ;)",

I would DEFINITELY recommend the egg salad. It's the best I've ever had. Service is great, food is delicious, and prices are on spot. What else could you ask for?",

I imagine on the weekend, it will be really tough to find parking if it is packed. They have meter parking, and unfortunately I didn't have cash, so we planned to just keep an eye out. However, our seating did not give us the view of the street. The waitress was super sweet and gave us some quarters - just in case. I had the Eastwood omelette with crispy potato pancakes. They both were very delicious. The crispy potato pancakes were cooked perfectly! They were crunchy and very flavorful. I would be happy with just those! The omelette included peppers, onions, cheese, ham, and bacon. Every ingredient stood out but didn't over power any of the others. So with each bite I tasted everything!! This was one of the best breakfast meals I've had in awhile. Can't wait to try something else on the menu.",

My wife and I both ordered a side of fruit and while it wasn't canned fruit, some of the grapes were a little rotten. My ham and cheese omelet was pretty good, but the ham was actually cold. If it would have been grilled, like the side of ham my wife ordered, it would have been better. So the food wasn't bad, and the people were friendly, but the rotten fruit, cold ham, and the fact it was actually a little on the pricey side for breakfast, I could only go 3 stars.",

I knew it would be a good experience when our server just gave us four quarters for the parking meter and told us about the street behind the restaurant to park next time.   The coffee was hot and not your typical water downed breakfast java.  It was bold and delicious.  They offer three different kinds of potatoes; cheesy, home fries and crispy potato pancakes. We had the latter two and they were both full of flavor.    The toast options were more extensive than most as well.  An added bonus included in the jelly selection orange marmalade and apple butter... again outside of the norm.  I had the chicken and the egg. Two homemade chicken tenders smothered in a very yummy homemade gravy, two eggs (mine over medium for a little dippy action), home fries and two thick pieces of marble rye toast.  My daughter had the Eastwood which was a stuffed omelet with all kinds of goodness.   My only lack of five stars was the price. For two of us with tip $30 for breakfast. A bit steep. But you pay for the ambience and the quality food.  Don't worry. I will be back!  Well done!!!  UPDATE     I was here again a few times.  Since my first visit I have eliminated carbs for the most part, in my life.  I wanted an omelette but I did not care for the toast and potatoes (so many choices)!  I asked to substitute a small side salad for the potatoes and toast.....they said yes for no extra charge!!!  They have come through again.  So if you are a KETO eater ....  give em a try.",

The neighborhood behind the restaurants has 2 hour free parking on the street. We only waited about 5 min for a table during Sunday brunch time. It was really hard to decide because there were so many good things in the menu. I finally settled on the the chorizo omelet with breakfast potatoes and wheat toast. The omelet was great, especially the feta, and the chorizo had just enough spice. It was a big omelet but I finished the whole thing. The breakfast potatoes were the best, with lots of seasoning and crispy edges. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy and loved it. I dipped my Toast in the gravy and it was really good. I think this place will be a frequent brunch spot until I try everything on the menu.",

It has a country kitchen feel to the decor and a nice laid back staff.  They serve mostly breakfast food but also offer a lunch menu. They also have multiple options to pick from. Sausage, bacon, corned beef, home fries, potato patty, wheat toast, white toast, rye toast, multiple syrups, etc. This is just naming a few!

The home fries were very good as well, But it was like a half a portion??? The eggs which should of been over easy where not cooked correctly not left on 2nd side long enough to cook it correctly. the yolk was fine but the whites were watery? / whites not cooked properly. If it was not for the fantastic and friendly service I would of given them 1-2 stars only. I give them 3 stars as the service was exceptional, But the food not. I do not think I would go there again as I generally eat the same thing all the time and to get half an order of home fries and eggs that are not cooked correctly I do not need to travel that distance.

I ended up getting the Olive Oyl omelette that had Feta Cheese, Spinach, Tomato, Red Onion & Kalamata Olives. No lie, it was the best omelette I've ever had in my life. Every bite was so flavorful and they were certainly not skimpy with any of the ingredients. It was such a beautiful day outside when we went and wanted to soak up every minute we could of the weather so decided to sit outside. Honestly though we were kinda bummed we didn't get the experience of sitting inside because it was so adorable. It has this country-ish vibe with a garage door that opens up. It's okay though, just means we'll have to come back again real soon!",

The tables have little tins for garbage, it is very well thought out. I had very high hopes!!  Sadly, hope this was a fluke,  our food was not as good as I hoped.  I had the eggs, bacon, cheesy potatoes, pancake and toast.  The eggs were under cooked, the bacon was SALTY!, the pancake had NO flavor, and the toast which is so good- I think was over kill. 4 slices of giant toast was too much.  No jelly was provided either.  The cheesy potatoes are scalloped potatoes they were very good! My husband ordered the omelette with peppers and ham. The peppers and onions weren't sauteed at all, the ham was fatty.  The potato pancakes were warmed up from a box.   Again way too much toast.  The place is adorable but the food was not as good as I hoped it would be.  I would give it a second chance,  but I'm not rushing back.",

    "text": "I stopped over here after my blood work \"fast\" to try out their breakfast. They actually serve lunch and brunch but I opted for breakfast. The place is very clean and there are tables and booths along with a bar to eat from.  Upon arrival I was told I could sit anywhere I wanted. I chose a large booth and my waitress was extremely attentive to my needs. I even had a cloth napkin which held my silverware. Portion sizes appeared huge but I had a craving for an omelette. If one on the list didn't meet your expectations then you can order a \"make your own\" with one meat and 3 other fillings. The omelet comes with toast of your choice, and your choice of home fries or potato pancakes.  Most omelets are 3 eggs so I ordered one with Swiss cheese and veggies. Everything you need is right on the table including ketchup. I got my food in a reasonable amount of time.  This omelet was delicious and the rye bread that came with it was very thick! Quite filling to say the least. I had coffee-your standard type you would get in most breakfast spots but I liked the fact that the food was not greasy and believe me hard to finish. Prices are very reasonable for what you are getting. This is a very small place on Brownsville Road almost directly opposite Brentwood Towne Square. Parking however, can pose a problem. Street parking is available if you are lucky enough to find it. You cannot park in the Towne Square and walk up. Signs are there stating they will tow unless you are visiting one of those businesses.   Definitely a must return to try out for lunch. 2 hour street parking is available during the day but again the spots are very limited.",

I chose a table in the front near the open garage door - very comfy with a nice cafe feel.     Both of our breakfasts were plentiful and tasty (skip the biscuit and gray though - the gravy was sub-par).   Staff members were friendly even with the chaos that a table on the patio was creating with their two dogs.   The chaos was actually quite entertaining and the people creating it were really good-natured, so it wasn't unwelcome or annoying.   You can BYOB to make bloody marys and Irish coffee and such.     Prices were reasonable, but don't forget to pay the meter....one $15 ticket later.",

Never have had a great experience food wise and lately it seems on the dirty side. I ordered the grin-eggs over medium, toast, and bacon. It wasn't busy in the dining room and I specifically told the young man who was my waiter I like my bacon crisp and do not want any uncooked white on my over medium/hard eggs. When my order came it was without my toast-he said it was in the toaster. I had to flag him down 5 min later to ask for my toast. He went into the kitchen which was also not busy-the door was open because of the nice day and I could see him grab my toast without washing his hands-he disappeared somewhere to butter it/ brought it to my table-never apologized or stopped back to see if I wanted jelly(not on the table). This same young man went on to handle menus/money and whatever I don't care to think about. AND my egg whites were runny and bacon so gummy I couldn't eat it. I am picky about cleanliness and also a nurse so know not washing hands before handling food can lead to illness. The owners need to educate food staff on importance of hand washing to protect the public.",

It was a cute place with nice waitresses.  I got a croissant sandwich that was really good.  The croissant was nice and flaky and I got potato pancakes as my side and they were good.  The waitress asked if I wanted sour cream or applesauce with them and I said sour cream but I didn't get it.  I could have asked her for it but after trying them I decided that I didn't need it and ate them happily plain. My grandpa got an open face sandwich and he enjoyed it but it came out cold so he asked for it to be heated up.  He was fine with it just being put in the microwave but they recooked it.  They didn't say that but it took a long time for it to come back, I was practically finished when it came back, and I noticed that the two bites he took weren't there so I concluded that it was a whole new plate.  I also kept seeing complaints about the prices being to high but to me the prices were average for the items being locally sourced.",

    "text": "O.K. After about a half dozen visits since it opened, we tried very hard to like this place, but they are not cooperating.  It's been a few months since we have been back, mostly because we've been underwhelmed.  (See my post dated 11/19/2015)  Today was not a shining example of what they could, or should be.  Previous visits required a wait to be seated, which, to me, was an indication they are busy because they are good.  Arriving shortly before noon on Monday, there was no waiting.  I noticed that only one other table was occupied...not a good sign, especially at the beginning of the lunch rush.  Before I go further, I must state that I owned my own restaurant and have worked in several places as a cook, so I am familiar with what goes on.  We'll start with my order: the Crack'd Royale with Cheese.  A hash brown patty (a la McD), a bacon cheeseburger and a sunny-side-up egg, all on a toasted English muffin.  This is accompanied by a scoop of cheesy potatoes.  It was good and presented nicely.  My wife ordered Biscuits and Sausage Gravy.  This is where it got a bit strange.  About a minute after ordering, the served came over and stated \"we're out of sausage for the sausage gravy.  The order doesn't come in until tomorrow.\"  Disappointed, my wife settled for a BLT.    While waiting for our order, we overheard a customer ordering sausage and eggs.  The customer was not told they were out of sausage.  We asked our server if they had sausage patties or links for breakfast orders.  She said \"yes we do\".  We then asked how they could be out of sausage for the sausage gravy.  Her response...\"the cook is very particular and the recipe calls for a different sausage than what they serve with eggs\".   I don't care what you say, that was a goofy answer.  There are only 5 ingredients in sausage gravy...Sausage, salt, pepper, flour, milk...If you have sausage in the restaurant, then you have sausage for the gravy!  Not having simple menu items is a sign of problems...either cash flow, the kitchen didn't to do the work, or ordering errors...any way you look at it, a problem.  With coffee and an iced tea, the bill totaled more than $23.00.  A price I don't mind paying for lunch when the place is nice (it is), the service is outstanding (it wasn't), the food is outstanding (it was very good, but not outstanding), and the menu items are available.  The final clue re-enforcing my sense of trouble, came as we observed the restaurant.    During the entire lunch hour (we left shortly before 1:00 p.m.) more than half of the tables were unoccupied.  This is not a good sign.  Like I said, we tried, but unless we hear that something has changed dramatically, we'll be elsewhere.",

    "text": "Went on a Sunday morning. The decor looks great and the staff was super friendly. Was impressed with the extensive menu. The portions were generous and served promptly. We got the blueberry pancakes, poached eggs, turkey sausage, bacon wheat toast and hash browns. Everything was amazing and tasted great. I only gave 4 stars because I like my turkey sausage to be links and I thought the blueberry pancakes could have had a few more blueberries but those are just personal preferences. We willl certainly be back. Go....you will not be disappointed!",

Think our server was Tammy because she finally asked if we had been helped, then said give her a min.  We ended up walking out.  Food looked great and a few of the servers appeared to be great.",
