    "text": "I absolutely loved the drunken noodles. I ordered it with vegetables and it was loaded with peppers, corn, green beans, mushrooms, all kinds of veggies as opposed to just a ton of onions and a few sad looking veggies (I'm looking at you Thai cuisine). I got takeout and was amazed that my food was still face of the sun hot by the time I got home. The noodles were firm and perfectly covered in a sauce that was spicy enough to make every pore in my face sweat. The spicy basil beef was also good but not as fantastic as the drunken noodles. Be forewarned that if they don't ask you for a spicy level that it is going to make you sweat. So if a ton of heat isn't your thing, you need to tell them. Since this is so much closer to one of the places I work, this maybe become my new go to for drunken noodles!  A quick note, check your bag before you leave. They forgot my samosas :-/ and partly my fault for not checking. The decor is relaxing and surprisingly nice for a strip mall. Indoors seats about 20 and they have a couple tables outside if you don't mind major car noise from the very busy Babcock.",

    "text": "Red Orchid has been a very welcome addition to my take out repertoire. I adore Thai food and was anxious to try this place after randomly having Red Orchid's spring rolls as a free sample at my gym after they first opened. Kind of a strange introduction to them, but knowing we could easily grab some yummy take out on the way home from the gym is appealing.  I've really liked and enjoyed the dishes I've tried here. I obviously gravitated towards the Pad Thai initially, and it's quite tasty. They prepare their tofu expertly, lightly crispy, never mushy or spongy as I've experienced other places. I've tried a handful of dishes since my first visit, but the standout to me is the Drunken Noodles. The rice noodles are homemade and extra fat, soaking in deep flavors of chili paste, basil and bell peppers. It has some serious heat even when I order a 4 spice level! Yum. This is definitely my go to dish here.  The portions are good, usually enough left over for lunch the next day. And the leftovers always reheat well. Prices are around $10-14 for dinner entrees, which it think is average compared to other Thai places in the area. I've eaten in their cute dining room twice, one for lunch and most recently for dinner. While our dinner service wasn't the most prompt initially, our food came out quickly once we were able to order and we got to meet the owner. Lunch portions are smaller but came with soup and salad, both of which were quite yummy.  If you are a Thai fan, this place should definitely be on your radar!",

I usually get the spicy basil with tofu. The vegetables that come with it are always fresh and in a delicious sauce. They always do a great job with the tofu, which is crisp but not too oily. I dislike overly squishy tofu but at Red Orchid the tofu is always great. I usually get brown rice with my dish which seems to be a mix of lovely hearty brown rice with some black rice mixed in. Whatever it is, I always really enjoy it.  I always find my food delightfully spicy but I occasionally get a bite that overwhelms me. So proceed with caution unless you can really handle spiciness!",

I asked if I had misunderstood their hours, and they made it sound like I was the one being unreasonable. Inconsistency seems to be the theme with this place -  I have stopped by multiple times during their \"open hours\" to see that they are just randomly closed with no message on their website and no message on their phone.  These are all service issues. I will say that when I have ordered, the food quality was very good, fairly priced, and well-sized portions.   However, these service problems may spell the end of my Red Orchid days.......",

That being said I think that  it is possibly the best Thai in Pittsburgh.  I have to say Pittsburgh because I've not experienced much Thai elsewhere, and that's also why I feel it is probably a 4.5 ( I'm rambling and probably not making any sense).  I go out of my way to order from here, and they are one of the few places in the area that serve Drunken Noodles.  The one thing to be careful about is the spice level it is never consistent, which as a person who enjoys spicy food it isn't a bother, but I on this most recent trip I ordered a level 5dish, a level 6 and a level 7.  The consensus was that the level 5 was hotter than the 7 and all three were too hot for the other people consuming the dish....which worked out for me cause I got all the leftovers.    On this most recent trip I ordered the following: 1.  Chicken Spicy Rad Ka Prao - I'm not sure the difference between this and regular Pad Thai, but it was great. 2.  Chicken Panang Curry - the \"To Go\" portion was filled with delicious curry sauce, too much for the rice that was given, but the sauce was the perfect blend of sweat and spicy.  This may have over taken the Drunken Noodles as my favorite dish here. 3.  Pork Bangkok Romen - Another good dish, all the pork and veggies were all chopped up.  I thought since it was romen (I know its not rAmen) it would be a noodle dish.  It comes with rice.  I liked the flavor, but would have preferred it with noodles.",

I have to say I was completely won over at the first taste of the Tom Kha soup. The broth was amazing and you could request how spicy you want it. Because it was our first time there, my hubby and I asked for level 5 for all our dishes. Five was a little too spicy for us with the soup hubby got Tom Yum w/ Shrimp, but seemed fine for our entrees (Yellow Curry w/ Chicken and Pad Thai Shrimp).   Our waitress was very helpful and recommended the proteins for our soups based on how they are typically prepared in Thailand which I appreciated bc I enjoy learning what is custom for the culture.  I did request more variety of vegetables in my curry and I definitely got plenty. I could barely eat 1/3 of what they prepared so I have awesome leftovers! Wish I had taken pics.   They have applied for a liquor license so no drinks yet but you can BYOB with a $5 corking fee. Also, it used to be a very small place but they have expanded and have a nice, spacious, eclectic dining area. Go...you won't be disappointed.",

Your mouth will thank me later!  Seriously though.  The noodles are always perfectly cooked, and there are tons of sprouts, thai basil leaves, and red peppers for you to enjoy.

Mad flavor in every dish I've had thus far.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu!  I've heard good things about their apps.  Anywho, if you're looking for good thai food, make sure to hit this place up!  I can (almost, haha) guarantee you'll like the food.  OH, and when they ask you for your spice preference, be careful!

    "text": "We went to Red Orchid on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, and I was really impressed with their food because the flavors and spice level were near perfect, and the portions and price for lunch were a great deal.    To start off, we ordered the Red Orchid Combination Sampler #2 which comes with 2 summer rolls, 2 spring rolls (fried), fried tofu, and thai samosas with a few different dipping sauces.  The samosas were unexpectedly sweet but delicious.  The Red Orchid samosas are filled with sweet potatoes and spiced with curry spices and cinnamon accompanied by a cucumber dipping sauce.  For my entree, I had the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) with tofu - I had forgotten how much I love this dish and Red Orchid's version was the best that I've had in years - it is stir fried rice noodles in a spicy chili sauce with basil, napa, bean sprouts, and bell peppers.  My partner got the Spicy Basil (Pad Ka Prao) with beef which he really enjoyed - the dish is stir fried with thai chilis, garlic, bell peppers, onion, bamboo shoots, green beans, and basil.  Based on the quality and the tastiness of the food, we will definitely be back.    Another attractive reason to come here is that there is plenty of open, comfortable seating where you don't feel like you are on top of the other diners, plus there is ample parking because the restaurant is in a small strip of businesses/shops on Babcock Blvd - a lot of other Thai restaurants that we frequent are nightmares for parking which is why we usually opt for take-out, so it will be nice to have a great Thai place to go to where we can sit down and enjoy our food right from the kitchen.",

    "text": "Currently sitting third on my favorite Pittsburgh-area Thai restaurant list (behind Smiling Banana Leaf and Nicky's), Red Orchid is an unassuming little place. The atmosphere is really welcoming and nicely decorated. The service is excellent and everyone is incredibly nice.  There aren't a lot of tables, but they do a good job of giving everyone space until it's absolutely necessary to sit people next to you in such a tight space. The prices are also very reasonable.  Overall, the food is good. I've really only tried their noodle dishes so far (pad thai, pad see ew, and pad kee mao) and a few appetizers. The flavor of their pad thai is similar to Nicky's, but the Red Orchid uses a thinner rice noodle. The thin noodles are really the only downside. The other noodle dishes are also good, though, and I'm looking forward to trying some of their other dishes.  Red Orchid is definitely a place worth checking out...especially if your'e in the North Hills and are looking for a respite from all of the overly-busy, predictable restaurants. It's BYOB and the atmosphere makes it a great date night spot. Enjoy...",

    "text": "My husband and I ordered take out on a whim. He got the Chicken Basil, I got the Avocado Salad and we ordered a side of Chicken Summer Rolls. Our total was $30.00 which is no big deal for two meals and a appetizer but boy, I was surprised by the portion. The Summer Rolls totaled almost $6.00 and we had two small rolls in the box. I thought maybe the taste would make up for  the portion but alas, I was also disappointed by the bland taste. My salad was a bit measly- store mixed lettuce, a couple tomatoes and slices of avocado. They weren't lying about the name, I will give them that. The dressing was the best part of the whole thing. It was a peanut butter based dressing and surprisingly good on a salad but definitely didn't fill me up. Also, I think I could have made myself a bigger portion for around the same amount of money- $9.00. My husband's Chicken Basil was indeed tasty but small. He asked for spicy level number 9 and they did deliver the expectation of spice. The chicken and vegetables were tender.  I would like to give this restaurant another shot but perhaps sit in and explore the menu more. The interior design of the building is beautiful and is surprisingly big on the inside.  Although I ordered some items that did not live up to my expectations(but maybe they are too high), I would still recommend.",

They also cheat on their sample appetizers: 2 pieces were actually 1 whole sliced into 2. The noodles were all sugary. ---- At par with Thai Gourmet, Thai Tamarind, or Smiling Banana. They have been consistent on the heat level, however inconsistent in sweetness (red and green curries occasionally too sweet). Also, they use canned sweetened pineapple, which ruins fresh taste. Overall nonetheless, good tasting Thai food, they do not fail on their noodles. Their best entrees are Wild Curry and Duck Curry.",

    "text": "I had basically reserved myself to the fact that I wasn't going to get delicious and authentic Thai food in Pittsburgh, let alone the North Hills. All of my love and memories of amazing Thai food remained back in graduate school, many years ago. Adding to all of this was that Mr. J. is not much of a fan of Thai food. To my surprise, he actually found this place via Yelp and we decided to give it a try.   First bonus is that you can order online for takeout. No, they don't deliver,  but this is a pretty cool feature of the website. I had the Tom Yum soup and Massaman curry. The soup was so flavorful and full of fresh, crisp veggies! I ordered it as a spice level 1 and it was just spicy enough for me. The massaman curry was creamy and thick, with tender chicken, potatoes,  carrots, and peanuts.....memories of graduate school come flooding back.   Mr. J. ordered the Bangkok Romen. It was very similar to lo mein, but they had forgotten to toss it in the brown sauce before packing it up. Even sauceless,  it was good. A shot of sriracha and soy sauce gave it the additional moisture and flavor it was missing.   I'd like to go back and dine in. While very good, I do think there was something lost during transportation. Take out is never as good as fresh from the kitchen.",

    "text": "I had takeout from here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend.  We had decided to get food from here the night before whenever we were on our way home from dinner we noticed a sign for this place at the corner of Babcock and Three Degree Road.  We decided to give it a try it since we both enjoy Thai food and there prior to this there had been no authentic Thai food in the North Hills.  It was definitely an experience trying to order from here since there was no menu online at the time due to their website being under construction and also because we had never seen the place before.  However we decided to go with some classic Thai dishes that they would be sure to have and so I ordered a beef red curry while my girlfriend ordered the pad thai.  Without knowing how spicy their food was going to be and after a slight misstep of a overly spicy 10 order in Vegas, I decided to be reasonable with a 6 while my girlfriend went with a 1. She was nice enough to pick up the food while I was out running a local 5K and so I was unable to see the place for myself.  My girlfriend did say that the place seemed quaint and that it also looked like it was BYOB.  My beef red curry came with the traditional items of baby corn, bamboo shoot and leaf (basil or kaffir) as well as an ample side of rice.  The curry tasted nice and spicy while also displaying a somewhat sweet flavor which I really enjoyed.  My girlfriends Pad Thai also had a good taste to it which she enjoyed.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future.  I  thought that their food was good and I am interested to actually see and eat in the restaurant.  It is also exciting that the North Hills finally has a True Thai restaurant!",

    "text": "Has anyone noticed that when a crowd of Yelpers gathers the discussion inevitably turns to \"the best Thai in Pittsburgh?\" What a lively discussion, too! My vote for the category? Definitely the Red Orchid in the tiny, little, difficult to get into (and out of) strip mall on Babcock Boulevard in Ross. The risk of those very necessary Mario Andretti sharp, quick left turns are definitely worth it!   Why? Let's start with Tom Yum and Tom Kha soups. Rich, spicy and totally satisfying kissed with lemongrass, kaffir lime and galangal with just the right heat. I ordered a 5 on a scale of 10 and it was just right for my heat-loving palate. If you're not a fan of heat, I'd go tamer than what you think would be a medium heat of 5. It was definitely more of a 7...and I like that!  Green Curry is my Thai food yardstick. I measure every new Thai restaurant by the quality of their green curry because it's my go-to favorite dish. The good news is I found Green Curry heaven at the Red Orchid! Spicy, yet sweet with coconut, crunchy green beans and silky eggplant made an especially flavorful curry with basil as the accent. I love that they give you the choice of jasmine rice or brown rice! And the portions are huge!  Kimber raved over the Wild Curry. She too likes her food spicy and ordered a 6. I really don't think there was much of a Scoville Scale difference between a 5 and a 6. I truly didn't see (or taste) much difference in flavor or ingredients between my Green Curry and Kimber's Wild Curry either...but both were delicious.  The Red Orchid is on my way home from work. Why mention that? It means I can place an order to pick up take out to eat in my jammies in front of the TV. Score! The last time I did that, Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) was the choice. Oh my goodness! I know Pad Thai is the national dish, but the wide rice noodles with chicken, napa cabbage, basil and lots of spicy red pepper paste won me over. Not that I'm abandoning Pad Thai mind you. Other faves have been appetizers of grilled Nam Tok (beef) with lime, cilantro and sticky rice and Chicken Satay with yellow curry or entrees of Spicy Basil Fried Rice and Spicy Green Beans.   The restaurant is lovely...and tiny with only 24 seats. Get there early or you may have to wait - this place is popular! Maybe it has to do with the fact that when the owner moved here from Thailand (a tsunami wiped out her restaurant there), she cooked at the Bankok Balcony, Nicky's Thai Kitchen and the Smiling Banana Leaf too, before opening up her very own restaurant in the North Hills. Keson knows Pittsburgh Thai-loving palates. Thanks Keson, for bringing GREAT Thai food to the North Hills!",

Unlike one of the other so-called Thai restaurants (in Wexford), this restaurant has great food, decent prices (you're not paying for pretentious decor, fancy lighting, and a trendy bar), and excellent service.   Just tried it today (9/8/12) and found it to be very pleasant.  Pad see eew was outstanding, pad thai and panang curry were also excellent.   Very friendly and accommodating staff.  Lunch specials are $7.50 and include soup or salad... nice presentation of the food.  Pleasant restaurant environment and nice decor/atmosphere (very clean yet and nice Thai decor yet without the pretentious bells and whistles), although small interior so there's not a lot of seating.   As mentioned by others a bit hard to locate (just south of 3 Degree Road intersection on Babcock, near Sherwin-Williams paint store), but once you find it you'll keep coming back.  We will definitely be going there regularly.",

    "text": "My quest to eat at all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh landed me next at Red Orchid. I was intrigued to read about the owner having opened a restaurant in her native Thailand only to have it wiped out by the tsunami. What brought her to Pittsburgh I have no idea but I'm super glad she's here!! Man, this was good! She's worked at Bangkok Balcony, Smiling Banana Leaf, and Nicky's Thai - all good resume material if you ask me!  While not the easiest place to find, this little restaurant is very nice inside and gives a different vibe than many others with the cloth table settings, the cute pendant lighting, and the soothing feel it all generates. The menu is very thorough and has dozens of things I love. We started with the fresh tofu summer rolls which were very good. You could tell that all the ingredients were indeed fresh because the flavor profile was outstanding. Next came soup or salad - I had a salad with a homemade pineapple dressing (delightful!) and my wife had the rice soup - which isn't at all bland like you might think based on the name. It was very tasty!  My spicy pork basil ordered, surprise, Thai hot was indeed Thai hot!! YUM YUM YUM!!! And wow, the flavors were amazing! Just like I hoped they would be! The pork was tender and skillfully prepared and the veggies were so obviously fresh and super tasty. Man, I'd order that again in a heartbeat! My wife ordered the Lad Nah which had the stir fried wild rice noodles (DELIGHTFUL!) with an assortment of fresh vegetables and a delicious brown sauce. So good! My daughter's masaman curry was superb as well and just the right hint of sweetness from the coconut milk.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! Count me in as a fan and as someone who will be back again and again! And yep, I agree, this is more like a 4.5 star place. It's that good. Worth finding for sure!!",

You may get stabbed by my fork or in the case of my vegetarian daughter, assaulted by my 'non-tainted clean\" utensils! Fortunately for both my husband and my daughter during our lunch  at Red Orchid my husband ordered his Pork Spicy Basil dish 'Thai Hot' and my daughter ordered the Massaman Curry that was loaded with potatoes (eh, Mom can do without potatoes but, dang that sauce was to die for) or I would have been obnoxiously dipping into their food across the table.  My Lad Nah with big honking handmade rice noodles and tons of veggies (including baby corn that tasted fresh - serious bonus!!!) in a yummy brown sauce with tons of flavor was pretty perfect. I ordered a 6 heat that was probably more of a 4-5, but I'm so not being picky about that because every bite was delectable.   The fact that the owner lost her first restaurant in Thailand during the tsunami and miraculously found her home in Pittsburgh working at one of my all time favorite Thai restaurants (Nickys!) among others, only makes me happier to discover this cute little place on Babcock Blvd. in the heart of the North Hills.   I look forward to returning regularly and perhaps revising my review upward after I taste a few more of the delights coming out of this happy Thai kitchen!",

(They offer a 1 to 10 spectrum) We got 4 and we were sweating and almost crying. Definitely should have been more conservative with our spicy spectrum.   We ordered a side of steamed veggies and it wasn't very fresh. There were dark colors on the carrots.  Portions were decent and the price for dinner was typical. Abour $12-13 for an entree. They have your typical Thai food offerings: pad thai, drunken noodles, green curry..etc. The service was a little slow but there was only 1 person serving / waiting on tables inside.   Ordered the Thai Ice Tea and it was delicious. We also ordered the sticky mango rice dessert and it was good to share with a friend.",

I have been to Thai restaurants along the east coast, and by far, this is the best Thai I have ever had.   Not only is the food authentic as it gets, the owners and staff are so friendly that when I was going through a hard time in my personal life, the waitress who I came to know over the years hugged me and gave me so many kind words. Aside from that they have expanded! They now have a liquor license and they are better than ever.   Dishes I would recommend:  Green Curry-To DIE for. The green curry has broccoli and the most perfect coconut milk in it with a side of rice. All the curries are delicious,  but this is my favorite. Get a level 1-2 spicy if you are beginner with Thai cuisine.   Drunken noodles- My second favorite dish. I must have ordered this dish 30 times over the past few years. The noodles are thin, wide, and so flavorful. I love the bean sprouts, green and red peppers, as well as the chicken I add.   Spicy Tom Yum Soup- My sister's favorite! It's really creamy, yet has the perfect balance of spiciness and flavor. Normally wouldn't order a soup for an entree but it really is filling.   Drink- Can't go wrong with a Thai iced tea. I wouldn't get an entree without it. It's sweet and balances out the spiciness from the entree.   Mango with sticky rice- A light, yet divine dessert to a wonderful meal.   Overall, my favorite restaurant has never failed me or my friends/ acquaintances. I would recommend it to anyone!",

A Double Take Deal and BYOB made it easy for her to accept my invitation.  I picked up a bottle of white and we met on a Friday evening to catch up over what we hoped would be a good meal.  We were not disappointed.  In fact, I don't even know if words can express how amazing our night was.  It was one of those magical nights where everything was just so lovely.  My friend and I shared some good conversation (along with that bottle of wine) with each other as well as our dining neighbors who could not have been more delightful.  Our waitress was attentive and we were very pleased with the service.  The food also surpassed my expectations.    While I was overwhelmed by the menu, I was very excited to see several duck items featured.  Not many places offer duck and when they do it is maybe one lone item.  On this night I luckily found Crispy Duck Cashew written on the specials board for the day.  It made my decision easier.  My friend went with the Crispy Chicken Cashew special and we started with an order of the fried spring rolls.  Our meals were delightful and we were enjoying ourselves so much that I ordered dessert.  After seeing the sticky black rice with pumpkin, I could not say no.  It was definitely the right decision.  I'd like to go back for more.  Perhaps to try one of the salads or soups.  I've learned to be careful when ordering a spice level, though.  4 is about as much as I can handle.  All in all, I say the atmosphere created by Red Orchid is definitely gong worthy!",

The location itself is small and in a strip mall on Babcock Blvd. Typically when I think of a restaurant in a strip mall I don't consider it to be anything fancy. Red orchid did a great job making their restaurant feel elegant. I personally loved the table runners and fresh flowers.   The food was delicious! I loved that they offered a variety of options and that curry fried rice was one of them! We ordered crab rangoons and my husband said that they are his new favorite in the city. He liked the mixture of sweet and a little bit of spicy.   They use a spice scale of 1-10. I traditionally order a 6 but it was a little too spicy for me. Delicious but spicy!   We'll definitely be back and we'll take advantage of the BYOB option.",

You can still BYOB but there is a service fee. We ordered the fried vegetable spring rolls to start. They came out quickly and we're really yummy. I got the drunken noodles with shrimp. Spicy level 5. It had a nice kick and got my nose running which is exactly what I want. My fiance got Pad Thai with chicken level 3. He doesn't dig the heat like I do but he really enjoyed it. I took a taste and it was great flavor. (I of course would have asked for it hotter, but everyone has their own preferences. ). This is a great spot. Would be great for a group.

    "text": "So after having a bad online ordering experience here a few weeks ago, it was a Monday I ordered online and went to pick my food up and there was a note on the door that said the business was closed for the day, so I just opted for the old fashioned phone call. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice, at first I asked for the Spice to be 2, then went for Spice at level 3. The woman on the phone was a little hard to understand She asked me a few times did I want soup or salad I said salad, I asked for salad she said something about the dressing, I thought she mentioned ranch so I said yes (turns out it wasn't ranch it's the normal ginger dressing). She said that it would be ready in 15 minutes I went to pick up the food in about 10mins and it was ready. There's a mini seating area on the sidewalk in front of the building I want to say 3 or 4 patio tables. I opened the Styrofoam container and blahhhh it doesn't look half as good as Nicky's Thai, but I won't let that sway my opinion. I tasted it and BAM spice smacked me right in the face, well mouth actually. If you're not too fond of spice get a 1, I actually like spice and asked for a 3 on my Pineapple Fried Rice and I am dying... my eyes are watering and the sides of my tongue are burning. My coworker said her husband usually gets a 10 elsewhere, but here he gets a Level 6 or 7. So beware of the heavy handed cooks! The flavor is okay a little bland, other than the spice of course. It seems like the pineapples are either canned or have just been sitting around a little long, still good. I do love the amount of fried egg they put in I never get enough eggs. I'm comparing it to Nicky's which is both sweet and spicy and I love theirs. I would love to try something different from here though I may try this again with a lighter Spice Level. Their lunch prices are good and you get either soup or salad with your order.   Would I order again yes? But definitely not at Level 3.",

    "text": "I have been to Red Orchid once before, and it was really good - but the spice levels are quite humbling.  A spiciness level 3 at Red Orchid is another Thai restaurants level 8 or 9.  Beware, or be prepared to be humbled.  I can confidently say that tonight's visit ranks as the weirdest of bizarro restaurant visits I've experienced in my 20+ years of restaurant dining.  We sit down, and I order a Thai iced tea and him, a water.  We order two Tom Kha soups, mine with shrimp at a spice level of 3 and him a chicken with a spice level of 5.  When they arrive, mine is the level 5 and his is the level 3.  So we send them back.  This time, they arrive and mine is correct but his is shrimp, not chicken.  So we send his back...I eat my soup and by the time that his soup comes, our entrees are in hand too.  He has the drunken noodles with beef, and I have the chicken noodle soup.  His entree is perfect, prepared properly and exactly what he asked for.  My chicken noodle soup on the other hand, is rice noodles in water with white chicken, scallions and cilantro.  Utterly flavorless, short of what little flavor that the chicken meat offers.  So I'm trying to eat this chicken and noodle water with vegetation, because I didn't want to further embarrass myself by sending this soup back after the Tom Kha fiasco.  Unfortunately, I couldn't take it so I asked for some chili pepper oil or something.  So she insists on taking the soup back to have some soy sauce or salt mixed in, which I agree because just want to eat my dinner in peace.  She brings it back and it's not any better.  So my waitress comes back and asks me if I want something else.  I resist, but she insists, so I opted for the drunken noodles that my husband had.  She brings that to the table a few minutes later, asks me how it is - I was thrilled!!! She then tells me that the boss is yelling at her, and motions toward an angry looking woman who is crossing the rear of the restaurant.  I smile, and tell the woman that the drunken noodles are amazing and that I'm very satisfied.   After a little bit, I ask her to box up the noodles since I want to take the rest home.  I ask about the mango sticky rice and she said that the mango is giant eagle because they're out of season.  She encourages me to try one of the more seasonally appropriate desserts even though the mango sticky rice is one of the specials.  I order a thai pumpkin sticky rice and she tells me that she's going to charge me for half of the soup I sent back.  We balk at this since we learned this after she insisted that I ordered something else, and after I've eaten the new dish.  My husband becomes annoyed and speaks up - the waitress informed him that if we don't pay for the dish, she has to.  We weren't understanding this concept, and a second waitress is attracted to the situation in the quiet restaurant.  I'm so embarrassed I want to disappear, when a third waitress comes to the table and informs us that the \"boss\" charges them for their mistakes and that the waitress was going to have to pay for the two original tom kha mistakes. I'm flabbergasted by the injustice of this knowing that it is against the law for them to do this to an employee since situations like these are the cost of doing business, and also horrified that we're being bullied into paying for something that wasn't our fault, simply because we feel bad for our waitress.    It's not her fault that she's not great at her job, but that's not an appropriate source of cost recovery.  We will think twice about eating there again, and maybe you should too.  Monday, I will be contacting the Pennsylvania Bureau of Labor Law Compliance and the U.S. Department of Labor to report that the \"Boss\" is doing this to their employees. My waitress goes back to the kitchen to put in my dessert order, and I can hear the boss screaming at her from two rooms away.  It was not a good situation to be in.  What's pretty on the inside isn't always pretty in the kitchen.  Buyer beware.  14 hours later: my husband and I have been sicker than a dog since our visit.  We won't be returning.",

I've been to silk elephant and a couple Thai restaurants near West Penn hospital as well. I just think that the food is very flavorful, staff is very friendly and attentive, and as of recently they started serving alcohol. The food is inexpensive. Unlike some of the Indian restaurants this place is very spot on with the desired spice level. If you ask for 10/10 it will be spicy. It is one of the few places in my life for which I lack the frustration of not being able to order a dish very very spicy.",

    "text": "In terms of convenience it satisfies, but in terms of quality, experience, and value, Nikki's 7-10 minutes away is superior. I ordered the Tom kha soup to start. It was in a soup bowl whereas Nikki's is served in their curry sized dinner bowls (practically a main course in itself). It tasted good except lemongrass seemingly dominated the dish. When I was ready to order my food, I had to walk over and find the waiter who was sitting down watching the World Cup in the other room even though I was the only customer in the establishment. When I received my check, it showed spice level of 0 (he never asked because I always order just 1 below the max), and there was a salad on the bill that I never received. After pointing it out, he appeared surprised that I still wanted it...if it came with the meal, might as well. Lastly, I asked for recommendations of protein pairings with the soup. He said, \"same....\" and left it at that whereas the folks at Nikki's discuss which courses or curries pair best with each protein. The drunken noodles did taste good, but the pork was very dry. Overall, it was disappointing at the lack of attention I received while being their only business mid afternoon. It terms of portion size, experience, and staff friendliness, I learned to just take the extra few minute drive to mt. Nebo.",

    "text": "My BF and I have been hooked on Red's Orchid's Thai food ever since our first takeout experience. I'd like to rate it a 4.5, if that were an option :) They've recently expanded their dine-in area. We started with, what else other than, the classic default Asian appetizer of Crab Rangoon. My go-to main dish order is the Green Curry with shrimp, which consists of broccoli, green beans, bell peppers, eggplant, basil mixed in a green curry paste & coconut milk. It is delicious, but seriously spicy. I order the lowest spice level at a 1 and it stills instantly makes me cough, my nose run and indigestion instantly flare... but I still LOVE the taste. Seriously it's delicious, even if I can only handle a bit at a time. Usually when I order take out I combat the spice by adding more coconut milk or yogurt. I am sissy when it comes to spicy, but truly even my BF thinks it is spicy for a level 1. Although, I just took my parents here and my Dad ordered a 3 in green curry and it seemed just as spicy as the level 1s I've had.  My BF tried something new on a recent trip, the Thai Panang curry with coconut milk prepared with broccoli, carrots and bell peppers. He ordered a spice level 5, so I was too scared to try it myself. My mother recently tried Masaman Curry at $12.50 of potatoes, onions, carrots, mixed in masaman paste in coconut milk. It was delicious creamy, sweet and peanut-y.   We also regularly order my other favorite dish, the Pineapple fried rice. It is stir fried with egg, pineapple, cashews, carrots, onion, scallions, and raisins which all combine to create the most delicious nutty flavor. Once I start eating this dish, I have a hard time stopping. I've had it multiple times and once it was a bit too greasy for fried rice.  I would really encourage anyone in the North Hills area to step up their takeout experience by ordering from the Red Orchid, or to stop in for the dine-in experience. I've written more on my blog & shared pictures if you are interested at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoscatoismymantra.com%2Fcategory%2Ffood%2F&s=c1bce86fc34bf46183a9c773d0cbf2c78d0d294494ac282853103305e9506253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">moscatoismymantra.com/ca...</a>",

    "text": "This is more of a 3.5 star restaurant.  The main thing about this place is that it made everyone I was with cough and sneeze from the unforgiving dry chili powder cooking fumes. I will add that I was here with another Indian couple so even they thought the place smelled oppressively spicy. I usually ask for hot sauce on the side so I can customize my own level of spiciness but this place only gives you a little tin of chili powder. That's as basic as it gets! At Chinese and other Thai restaurants, they give you a side of house-made chili oil sauce or at least Sriracha.   My dish of the Thai chicken ramen was okay but note to self--NEVER order chicken for a dish like this. It just comes out dry, flavorless and cut too big. I've seen this at most places but the price difference was just too high to jump to seafood and also, pork wasn't even an option. Two people order the curries at my table and they looked and smelled great, so clearly, that was what I should have ordered. My friend ordered their crunchy noodle special and it was just DROWNING in sauce. The Hong Kong style of cooking pan fried noodles is to have the noodles themselves remain flavorful and crunchy while a savory, light sauce with stir fried vegetables lightly coats everything. This was not the case here and that dish looked like a mess.   I did like the decor but there definitely needs to be more separation between the heavy kitchen fumes and the dining area. Prices were higher than average and portions are a little above average too (although I managed to finish everything).",

Today was a different story when it comes to the service part.  All started with wife calling to order food for take out. Was told it would be ready in about 20 minutes. Stopped to vote on the way, and went to pick up food. Wife walks in to pick it up and is told they have no orders for take out. Wife said she called, where he answered nobody called and he's only one there. Wife shows him the phone where he can see that she called and as this happens an older lady walks out from the back. He says something to her in Thai and she says \"oh, I forgot\". Obviously she took the order and forgot to turn it in. After waiting for so long, wife finally gets the food, pays and comes back to the car. They did not apologize for any of what took place and did not offer a discount. Will look for different place for good Thai food in the area.",

    "text": "Tasty Thai! The sauces are full of flavor along with the heat. We ordered the combo appetizer sampler #1. I was super curious about their Red Orchid style bread. It was similar to a French toast but savory and deep fried. Crab rangoons were perfectly done, spring rolls and steamed dumplings were decent. I enjoyed the variety of sauces.   For the entree, we ordered the chicken Pad Thai and Phuket Crispy Noodles. Pad Thai was on par with others in the Pittsburgh area but the Phuket Crispy Noodles sauce was full of flavor! The seafood was slightly overdone for my taste but the everything else was perfect. I was in such a food coma, I forgot about dessert!  I got the Spicy Pork Basil Dinner to go and had a quick taste when I got home. Again, full of flavor and Pork was cooked well. I'd happily go back to this restaurant in a heartbeat!",

    "text": "Imagine our delight when we realized Red Orchid delivers!  YAHOO!    Perfect for a \"ain't gonna budge off the couch rainy Sunday\" dinner option.  We pulled up the YELP \"order online\" option and received our order delivered hot, fresh, within 30 minutes, and with a smile.  The driver will call you to let you know they have arrived which is another great feature of this service.  We ordered the Lad Nah Dinner which is stir fried wide rice noodles with broccoli, mushrooms, baby com, carrot, and topped with light gravy that was reminiscent of chicken gravy to be honest. The noodles sort of stick together a little bit because they deliver them in a separate box (which is thoughtful but they need some sauce or something so they don't turn into a big gelatinous mass of noodle).  Pretty good though I would order it spicier next time - bump it up to a three from a one spice level.  We also got some Yum Ma Kua which is grilled eggplant mixed with ground chicken, lettuce, red onion, scallion and tomato and comes with a spicy lime sauce and it is absolutely delicious.  It's the perfect balance of acidic lime and layers of spice.  The eggplant is on the mushy side but we loved it.     The Tom Kha Soup was very good too.  It's a soup made with coconut milk, flavored with galangal, lemongrass, mushroom, cabbage, carrots and it arrived garnished with fresh scallion and cilantro.  I ordered mine vegetarian but would recommend ordering chicken or shrimp next time.  It was a tad bland with just steamed veggies in it.   We also got an order of the Green Curry Dinner, a side of Steamed Mixed Vegetable, and for dessert, the Thai Pumpkin Custard.  Their Green Curry is sublime.  Truly.  Order some.  And the curry comes with fresh green beans and green pepper that are al dente and a great compliment to the spicy coconut milk curry sauce.   We really loved the pumpkin custard too but wished it was bigger but that's not a knock against the restaurant at all - we just loved it and wanted more!",

At first, it's quite tame but towards the end of the meal my mouth is usually on fire (note: my dad loves spicy food so he gets the 6 and said it's not too hot for him).   Although the service was slow at first, our waiter ended up redeeming himself before the end of the meal.   It's a cute little place. Would definitely recommend it if you want to try out some nice Thai in the area.",

The flavors are there and if you like spice, you'll definitely be happy - I ordered a level 5 with the panang curry and the heat was higher than I expected...but I liked that). If you're not big on heat but want a little I'd probably suggest ordering a 2. We also had the potstickers which were really tasty - I probably could have eaten 6 more! :D  My only complaint is that the Panang Curry's consistency was more of a soup than a curry - I expect curry to be on the thicker side but this wasn't the case. Still tasty though! And I had plenty to take home afterwards. I'd probably order take out from here in the future.",

I usually order a 4 spice level at other Thai restaurants and that's usually not too spicy for me. I ordered a 4 here and my stomach was on fire afterwards.   Anyhow, the pad see eew was good. The sauce was on the thin side and had a distinct soy sauce flavor, but was balanced nicely with a subtle sweetness. The pad thai was sweet and a hint smoky. Also ordered a tom kha soup and I thought it was average, but still loaded with veggies, which was a plus.   I would definitely stop back in if ever I'm in the North Hills area. If a 10 spice level at other Thai restaurants isn't spicy enough for you, I highly recommend giving Red Orchid a try!",

I have come here before many times and was mostly pleased.  We were one of the only tables here and got the worse service.  Our server could have cared less if we stayed or left.  We actually left because she never came back to check on us, give me my food, or even leave us a check... So maybe I was in an institution....perhaps?  This really sucks because I was ecstatic that north hills had a Thai restaurant...now I have to drive all the way to Thai place in cranberry.",

They were very accomodating and knowledgeable about the gluten sensitivity of two people in our party. The pad kee mao was so good, with a nice balance of vegetables, noodles, and meat (chicken). It was spicier than I expected, in a tasty way. And one of my favorite desserts was the special - mango sticky rice, a hit with the whole family.",

    "text": "This place is tiny but you won't miss the neon red letters out front. We showed up around 6:30. My first impression when we walked in was, where are we going to sit? I found about a dozen tiny tables with very little space keeping them apart with a long bench up against the wall. The inside is not what you'd expect it to be, very modern and hip. Cute lamps above every table and lots of wood work that looked like it came from Thailand. Almost every table was taken, aside from three that had a reserved sign on them. The girl that received us removed the sign from one of the tables and sat us right away. As we were looking at the menu, people kept coming in, some where waiting for a table, some were ordering take out. I was thrilled, I knew we found the Thai gem of the North Hills. My husband ordered Thai Style Fried Rice and I had the Garlic entree, we also shared the Fresh Summer Rolls with tofu as an appetizer.  The appetizer was light, not enough for my hungriness so I couldn't wait to get my entree.  First time I go into a Thai place I like to order a typical dish, maybe because I want to compare it to other Thai restaurants. My dish was good, very good; it came with a side of white rice shaped as a heart. My husband wasn't so enthusiastic about his, he said it was plain; the rice was clean, it didn't taste over fried or greasy, but it needed a sauce. I didn't try it because I don't eat chicken. I give it a 3 stars because, although my dish was very good my husband's was not, and the place is too small. Regular size people may have a hard time getting past the opening between the tables to sit. I also could hear the conversation of the people's sitting next to us (you'll be that close to the table next to yours). Oh, and since it's BYOB we took two bottles of wine (one white and one red): $2.75 per bottle or per person, not sure.",

Just right, freshly decorated. Pretty small. BYOB.  I stopped for takeout in the middle of the afternoon and my order was ready in 10 minutes. They weren't busy at this in-between time. Service was fast and friendly.  The soup option that came with the lunch portion was Tofu that day and really delicious. It reminded me of chicken noodle soup but with added Thai spices and flavor and lots of black pepper. There weren't noodles but chunks of what tasted like fresh silky tofu. The lunch portion of Drunken noodles was excellent, lots of veggies, wide chewy rice noodles that were almost in chunks, tofu that tasted fresh - no stale oil flavor. I asked for very spicy and got what I'd consider a 5 though I appreciate that they'd rather be safe and not burn someone's mouth. The lunch portion was enough for me with the soup although I would have eaten more if there was more as it was that good. $7.50   The dinner portion of pad thai was a nice dinner portion - about the size you'd expect. The sauce was pretty good, not too sweet with a medium amount of spice (asked for 7 and it seemed more like a 4 to me but I like spicy). I'd call it much better than average Pittsburgh pad thai as I think average is usually too sweet and greasy and this was not. There was a bit more to the sauce than the traditional Thai thin sauce. $11  I can't wait to go back.",

If you are in the McCandless area north of the city, this is really one of the few Asian food options, and more importantly, one of the very few non-chain restaurants.  Appears to be a small family run business.  Good food, fast service, BYOB.  Tasty food.  I am particularly fond of the papaya salad (if you are not familiar, an unripened papaya, crunchy, spicy, a bit of fish sauce flavor).  It may sound odd, but the flavors are wonderful.  The spicy basil dishes were also quite good.  One thing I have found on my 3 visits there is that the spicyness level is a little inconsistent.  One of our 3/10 dishes tasted around an 8/10, and one of our 5/10 tasted like a 1/10.  This is an excellent option if you are in this area.  There is limited seating, tho - probably about 8 or 9 tables inside, and 2 tables outside.",

    "text": "Red Orchid - what a nice addition to the fledgling restaurant scene in North Hills (NoHi really has no excuse for such a crappy restaurant scene, but I digress). On the way to my boyfriend's parents' house and we were starving. They live up north in the mountains so it's a little drive with almost no good options on the way. As we pass through NoHi anyway, we figured we'd finally try this place out.  It won't replace Smiling Banana Leaf or Nicky's Thai for me, but it's a solid option. I ordered the green curry with tofu, spice level 7. The tofu was nice and firm, which I loved. I can't stand when my tofu gets soggy. This dish was also nice and spicy. I may kick it down to a 6 next time ... though maybe not. It left my lips burning, but nothing I couldn't handle. Not like the time I ordered green curry, spice level 7 at Silk Elephant and thought my eyes were going to burn out of my head, tongue out of my mouth.  My biggest issue with the curry was that it was thick. It was purported to be made with coconut milk like normal, but there wasn't much of a coconut taste and, as I mentioned, it was really thick, not at all runny. Didn't like that. Also, it did not pack as much flavor as the aforementioned thai restaurants.  My boyfriend ordered the pad thai, his staple, and he said it was really tasty. My other problem with Red Orchid the day we went was the service. Super friendly but rather slow. We sat and waited for forever for someone to come take our orders and then bring us the check. That was disappointing. Not trying to turn anyone off from trying this place. If you're actively searching for thai food, I highly suggest Smiling Banana Leaf (Highland Park) or Nicky's Thai (Northside and Downtown) over here, but if you're in NoHi, there's not much out that way that tops this place.",

Big, colorful lights with fresh flowers on each table. I ordered the Pad Phet with beef, onions, peppers, carrots, green beans and bamboo shots with a spice level of 8. Food came out about 7 minutes after we ordered. It was very flavorful and authentic. Had just the right amount of spice for me even though I typically do 10. It came with steamed jasmine rice in a heart shape. I would get this dish again, but I'm shooting for the red curry next time. My co worker got the cashew chicken with a 0 spice level. She said it was very tasty. We were in and out in an hour. Very relaxing atmosphere. The place is very comparable to Nicky's. I probably give Nicky's the slight edge because their presentation of entrees are a little better looking and the food is a bit spicier. I will definitely return to Red Orchid and it's even better it's so close to where I live and work.",

    "text": "The two most important men in my life are on a very serious Thai food kick recently which has lead me to places I wouldn't have made a second glance at before.  I work with my dad, so his cravings sometimes get the best of him when I ask him \"What are we doing for lunch today?\" and he asks me to find a place close to Wexford to satisfy his Thai tooth.  We tried Red Orchid today.  It was a little far from our office, but I think it will be a place we frequent when he's in the mood because there aren't any others in the area that I feel are worth trying.  I placed an online order today for 4 of us and paid mind to other reviewers' comments that said their spicy is REALLY spicy.  We ordered 2 chicken pad Thai at levels 3 and 4, pumpkin curry at level 3 and I got the Lad Nah at a level 1 because I didn't feel like sweating through my shirt today at the office.  The online ordering feature is very convenient and you can specify what level of spiciness you want as well as pick a time for pickup.  They do not offer delivery.  Our order was ready when it said it would be.  The food was really good! They do lunch or dinner portion sizes.  I could eat the lunch portion for dinner and have a full meal for $7.50!  I was told the chicken pad Thai was very good and that the noodles tasted fresh.  I really enjoyed my Lad Nah and especially liked the fact that they put the noodles on the side for me to add to the dish.  The pumpkin curry was good (I'm not huge on curry but its my dads favorite dish), but he said he preferred Pusadee's pumpkin curry to Red Orchid.  Service was as decent as it can be for an online takeout order, but it was ready when it said it would be.  The food, like I said, was very good.  However, I didn't eat it and say \"OMG THIS IS AMAZING\" the way I have at a couple other places (see other reviews) and so that's why I didn't give it a full 5.  I am sure we will be back, though :)",

Well, I do, but I'd rather have moved back to Bloomfield. Since I couldn't get that, I was pleased to discover that at least there was a Thai place nearby. Thai is one of my favorite cuisines of all; I love the balance of flavors, the heat, the SOUP! I was chagrined to learn they don't offer delivery; we went with takeout, instead. Presumably you can order on their website, but it's never worked properly for me. I used the old-fashioned method of picking up the phone.  For our first foray at Red Orchid, we chose a tom kha soup with chicken; larb; and shrimp pad thai. My husband is still new to Thai food, somehow, so it seemed best to have a \"safe\" noodle option for him. Plus I love pad thai. So there. I ordered everything at a 5 on a 1-10 spicy scale, figuring I'd adjust going forward.  The tom kha soup was rich with coconut milk, perhaps... too rich. I never thought I'd say that, but it about overwhelmed the other flavors. It still tasted pretty good but I wished there was a little more of the lemongrass broth and a little less coconut. I actually didn't finish it. This was disappointing, since this soup, done perfectly, is my \"if you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life\" thing.  Undeterred, I moved on to sample the pad thai. It was good and had tangy flavor, plenty of egg bits (bonus points), and the noodles weren't overcooked. Several of the shrimp tasted slightly off; it WAS a Monday, but still. A 5 wasn't terribly spicy in this case; I'd have liked a little more piquantry on my plate. Overall, it was about on the same level as, say, Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield. I like Thai Suan Thip's best in Pittsburgh.  The larb, though... o, larb. This meat salad is a thing of glory, redolent of fish sauce and lime juice and (in this case) mint. It's so fresh and so clean, and I adore it. Red Orchid's is served over cut lettuce, rather than with leaves to wrap it, which is just fine by me. Plenty of dressing/sauce, and the spice level here was perfect. Just thinking about it makes me wish I were eating it right now.  The portions were generous, with the above making a perfect-sized dinner for a ravenous pregnant woman and a large adult male. The prices are about on par with other Thai establishments in the city, with Thai Suan Thip remaining the high price point outlier (but the food is so good!).   Definitely good enough to go back fairly often; not good enough to knock any restaurants out of the running for top Thai.",

You must have Thai Tea as a beverage, as it is delicious!!  All of the curry and noodles are super tasty.  They are happy to accommodate your spice tolerance if you are a 0 or a 10.  Service was great!!  Thank you Red Orchid for a great family dinner!!",

It was fantastic, and I love that it is served with jasmine rice. I had the tofu soup for an appetizer and must have eaten it in one minute flat. Will definitely be coming back asap!",

    "text": "Went to Red Orchid last night with friends and it was outstanding.  We love Thai and have tried it everywhere - this is now our favorite Thai restaurant.  Started off with Tom Yum soup, which was great.  I had Red Curry Land and loved it.  As noted in other reviews, it was spicier than what other restaurants might serve, but it was just right for me - great combination of flavors.  Dessert was a special for the night that was spectacular.  (Don't know how to pronounce it, much less spell it.). Definitely want to try the pumpkin custard or custard with sticky rice next time.  Portions were very generous and the service was excellent.  We'll definitely be back and have already recommended to friends.",

Never failing on my spice addiction!  The crab rangoons are also a yummy way to start a meal! Very small inside so if you have a group it's best to order take out.",

We had the ginger shrimp, pumpkin curry and seafood special. The coconut soup was the best I ever tasted at a Thai restaurant. The desserts were so tasty! The only issue was with my husband's tofu dish, the tofu was pretty tough, but no matter we will definitely be back!!!",
