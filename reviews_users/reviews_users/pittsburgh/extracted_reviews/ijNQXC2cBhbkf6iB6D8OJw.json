    "text": "Terrible service. Ordered a late night pizza and told 45 minutes. Driver calls close to 90 minutes later with lame excuse about getting sent the other direction and still 7-8 minutes away. Called the restaurant to request 50% off and no deal. Then, after asking who the owner is so I can lodge a complaint I'm told by someone with an accent that they don't know, call back tomorrow and after asking several times I was hung up on, twice. I was assertive, and angry, but no cursing or yelling. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!! Hopefully with my Hilton status I can have them removed from the hotel's recommended listing. I would not give this place any business if your counting on them, unreliable to a fault.",

They were generous with the cheese. Overall, the pizza I received was average (not bad, but not great). As someone who is new to the area, I will likely try other pizza places in the future.",

    "text": "My family lives on the South SIde of Pittsburgh so we find ourselves ordering out quite often.  You know I've come to not really expect much from these pizza joints.  Like warm food and maybe 3/4 of my order correct.  However we've ordered from this place about 5 times so far over the past 6 months.   Their customer service on the phone is 100%.  They are always so polite to me when I call.  And trust me sometimes I have a fussy newborn and/or a 7 year old who changes what she wants a few times when I am ordering.  But each time they are so patient and they even suggest things to me.  We are now hooked on their Spinach and Feta Pie.  This time we ordered that Pie and a Six Cheese Pie.  Oh and we cant forget the Steak Deluxe Hoagie.  Everything is just so yummy!  The ingredients they use are fresh.  And each item has so many flavors not just your bland tasting pizza.  The pizza came to my door in under an hour!  Also the pizza guy was extemely nice when he got here too.  He was a cute one too ladies! hahah ;)  So my experience with them as usual is awesome.  I probably should call them and tell them how much I appreciate their food and customer service.    I guess the only negative thing I can think of is their pricing.  Gourmet Pizza sm. $10.99, med. $14.99, large $17.99, ex Large $19.99.  But honestly I dont care to pay more if the quality is there too!  YUMMMMMMMMMMMY",

For $9 I received a decent sized salad with shrimp and imitation crab. Took about 40 minutes for delivery which is totally acceptable.

Their pies are the best that I have tasted in Pittsburgh (so far). So many other joints I have tried mess up the crust, which once you've screwed up the base you've got nothing else. But their pizza crust is thick and chewy, just the way I like it.  I love how they load their pizzas up with toppings (another thing that some pizza places skimp on, which makes for an angry Quay!). Everything tastes fresh and incredibly flavorful.  We ordered in from Genoa's on the nights where we really don't feel like cooking. They were a godsend when we were in the process of moving. We've always managed to get our food delivered well before the quoted time, piping hot, and the delivery guys and the guys who take our order are always pleasant.",

    "text": "Wed. 10/7/15 4-5:30pm I walk into this unremarkable hole-in-the-wall pizza joint, I order a single slice with a few extra toppings, it comes out to $5.31. I hand the cashier my trusty debit card and after a couple times running it, she informs me it doesn't work. \"Oh, that's odd. Shoot, I didn't bring my wallet on my bike. Okay. Well, thanks.\" I take a step back and make a call to my bank, with all the traveling I do, occasionally security will red flag the card, but a quick phone call will unlock it. Unfortunately, \"due to a massive information leak, a lot of cards have been cancelled for security reasons\". After an extremely tedious round of \"brief holds\" and being disconnected twice, I'm finally able to make a one-time transaction at the ATM. Success! Cash! That's the last time I leave the hotel with just my ID and one card! It's been nearly an hour. I'm spent. And really hungry. And now late for my massage appointment. But at least I can finally get this delicious pizza my friend talked about. I go to the counter and reorder my slice. I notice that now it is happy hour and one of the specials reads \"free appetizer with $5 purchase.\" Pleased that some good has come out of wasting a hour on the phone, I ask about adding that happy hour deal to my order. The goateed cashier says, \"if you want to order a beer you have to go to the bar.\" \"Oh, no beer, thank you, just the appetizer.\" He repeats himself, I repeat myself, and accepting we must be experiencing a language barrier, I go to the bar anyway. I try to order my slice of pizza and an appetizer. The bartender says, \"You can't have ordered at the counter already to get the appetizer here. You have to order over five dollars at the bar.\" I look back toward the counter, confused. \"No, I didn't order over there, I was told to come here.\" \"You ordered earlier.\" (I come to realize it's the same girl who ran my card before.) \"Oh. Yes, I tried. But my card wouldn't go through so I called my bank. I have cash now. I'd like to order with the bar so I can get the appetizer for happy hour.\" Her tone is escalating in rudeness, \"Yeah, well, you'll have to pay for that pizza from before and then order over five dollars from the bar.\" She walks away to another customer at the bar.  The gentleman next to me offers to let me order an appetizer on his tab since he has spent well over five dollars at the bar. Gratefully, I accept and we let the bartender know our plan. Again with the rude tone and a roll of her eyes, to boot, \"no. We can't do that.\" I'm so frustrated. I give up. I've had it. Forget the damn pizza. \"Okay, you know what, I don't want anything. Thanks.\"  I pick up my twenty from the bar and start to leave. The bartender apparently can't help herself from viciously spewing, \"Well if you can't afford it, maybe you shouldn't be here.\"  I'm stunned. \"What a rude, bitchy thing to say.\" \"Hey, the truth hurts.\" Then she ran away to the kitchen before I could respond. Of course you think of everything you would like to have said later... It would have gone something like... \"Broke? You work at a fucking pizza place, Bitch.\" Shocked, frustrated, humiliated, I asked for the manager at the counter. A tall, thin, Indian-looking man stretching pizza dough in the back stays rooted to the spot and hollers, \"I'm the manager, what's the problem?\"  \"Could you come over here, please?\"  He sighs and begrudgingly approaches the counter. I take a breath to calm my irritation so I can communicate effectively. At the end of my account, he looks at me blankly, unsympathetically, and says, \"what do you want me to do?\" I can't believe it. \"What do I want you to do?!\" With attitude he says, \"We are busy right now. We don't have time for this. You want a piece of pizza?! I'll make you a piece of pizza!\" (Busy is not what I would call the place. The large first room of tables is completely empty. On the counter side, there is a table of six, a table of four, maybe six people at the bar, and no line to order. Five guys making pizza and two serving girls.)  I'm disgusted with this place and appalled with the alarming opposite of customer service, \"No, I don't want your pizza.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.\" \"No, I don't want you to fire her.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do? I can't fire her right now because we are very busy.\" \"No, I don't want you to fire her.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do?!\" \"Nothing. Forget it.\"  That was it. I left. Wow. My day really went down hill with the decision to go to Genoa.  As I rode back to the hotel, I was frustrated with myself for letting some snotty, trashy, pudgy, $8-an-hour-plus-tips bar tender get to me. I've done my time in customer service and food service. I was great at it. Then I moved on and built a career. Now my work pays me to travel all over North America and Europe doing what I love. Who's broke now, Bit",

The bread was great. All the bread in Pittsburgh is great (or at least most of it). Large, crispy, crunchy, fragile, toasty bread. The only complaint was it was corn dusted on the bottom. This makes for messy fingertips and a messy desk.  I got a steak hoagie. Four thick slices of steak and tons of browned, bubbly cheese. Very tasty. Unfortunately, they do serve their steaks Pittsburgh style....covered in lettuce and tomatoes. No biggy, I got mine without. The onions were crisp, fresh red onions. I would have prefered sauteed onions on a steak but its no big deal. They did charge me a buck for the bannana peppers, even though I left the more expensive tomatoes of my hoagie. And it appeared that they let Peter North put the mayonnaise on it, it was pretty much coated in the stuff.  Tasty hoagie though. If they would have limited the mayonnaise to a reasonable level, it would have been perfect.  Everyone else was more than pleased with their food. Fast delivery, too, even for a Saturday night.",

Lots of fresh greens, tomatoes and a big pile of fresh pizza mozzarella.   Their homemade ranch dressing tops it off well.   This is a negative for me,  but the steak is more of a jiffy steak.   Some folks love it,  but I prefer a real steak,  rare.  The subs and burgers definitely beat my expectations for a corner pizza joint.  The burgers are large and definitely a good quality,  if not handmade.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is AWESOME, with their yummy Buffalo 'fries'  on top.   I get it with their ranch on top.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get there,  but definitely worth a try if you work downtown.",

    "text": "Typically I order from Ephesus Pizza (they are amazing!) but this time I gave Genoa a shot. It unfortunately was bad. I'm giving it 2 stars, as I think a 1 star review is reserved for those who find sanitary issues (bugs, hair, etc) or something pretty heinous. I'll give you a play by play:  1) Delivery driver gets here. He calls as they typically do, and I walk outside. He is sitting in his car in the middle of the street and continues to sit there. I literally had to walk barefoot to his drivers side door to get my food.  2) I ordered fries, 2x gyros and a large pizza. I open up the fries and they are soggy as all hell. Now, fries are tricky. Most restaurants poke holes in the box to let the steam escape so they don't get super gross. This restaurant did not.  3) I open the gyros up and they are sooooo soggy from the grease off the gyro meat. It's wet and slimy and pretty gross feeling. I pull out the tzatziki and it's fully separated. This means it was made (lord knows when), portioned off in portion cups and thrown in the fridge. Then the waters separate from the dairy fats. It's not bad, it just looks bad. What was bad though, was the lettuce on the gyro. It was soggy (probably from mixing with the hot grease from the gyro meat) and it was brown and tasted awful.  4) I open the pizza, hoping that it would redeem the poor quality of the meal, and it's lukewarm at best. This is within 5 minutes of it being dropped off. I was so disappointed. Flavor was ok (it was chicken and bacon), but the crust is that generic crappy dough that you find at any hotel delivery pizza place like Pizza Mia, Pizza Palermo, Pizza Parma, Pizza Perfectta....you get the idea.   Never am I going to order from here again. Issues across the board, so I highly doubt it was a one time situation. I'm definitely going back to Ephesus as my go-to. They are fantastic with many many more wonderful options. Can you say \"dry plum chicken pizza\"? Because it's the best.",

I had looked this place up on yelp after ordering and was a little weary after seeing reviews. However! I was pleasantly surprised. I judge a pizza by if i want to eat the crust or not. Let's just say I ate it all (not in one sitting ) but the toppings were packed on and the flavor was great. The side of ranch it came with was really tasty as well. I just re-heated some pieces for lunch today and it was still just as good. The portion to price ratio was very reasonable. I would totally order from here again.",

The sandwich comes with fries on it Provolone, cheddar and ranch. I swear I've never seen a sandwich have less meat!!! It looked like they put 2 frozen steak ums that you get from the market on the roll added fries and cheese and called it a day, they didn't even chop it up which might just be a personal preference but I've  never seen it like this before. The flavor of the meat was just ok however I do think they put a good amount of cheese on it and the ranch was good it tasted homemade which I love. I may go back again if my co workers decide to get it but I will definitely order something else and pay for extra meat.",

Let me just say, Genoa's dose cheese fries better than anyone. Also, they have great pizza (obviously) and their hoagies are awesome. I've tried a lot of different items on the menu but my most recent love is the eggplant parm. So good.   The service is really good, everyone is friendly. I appreciate the atmosphere. It's really comfortable. They get a good crowd.",

    "text": "The reviews were so mixed which always makes you wonder if they're paying to have reviews written.  The answer is \"probably\".  I ordered on seamless and they came up as a place that delivers (after one am).  I ordered a hoagie, boneless wings and a quesadilla.  The hoagie was actually decent and edible.  The boneless wings were just slightly undercooked and rubbery. The quesadilla - not sure  what they did here but they either don't own a fry pan or a flat top because it was just a soggy shell full of yellow cheese.  It had potential.  Hey - I am one guy and ordered 3 things and one of the items was edible.  Small win for me, but I'd say this place needs to spend some time and hire an experienced cook.",

    "text": "This place is absolute trash.  The bartender, Kimmie, is totally rude and unprofessional. She allowed a customer who I assume to be a friend of hers, to become extremely drunk and belligerent and start harassing customers. And when I decided to say something to her about it, she cut me off as if I was the problem. Like I said trash. It was dirty and I did order food but threw it out because I didn't trust it after complaining and receiving the reaction I did.  Never, have I ever been treated with such disrespect in a restaurant and I'm black lol. I will never go back to that establishment and will recommend AGAINST them every chance I get.  And to Kimmie if you see this, you suck at your job so yes I will tell you how to do it.",
