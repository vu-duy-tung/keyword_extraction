But the coffee is watered down and not good- definitely need to fix this.   The servers are very friendly!   Some of their menu items are a little over-priced but we don't get to Pittsburgh very often- once every few months.  The wait times can get frustrating, as there is no where to sit and wait.  They do have a nice text message system to notify you that your table is ready so that helps some. Make sure to bring cash ONLY!   It's quite irritating. This is 2015...accept cards.",

The bright colors and game board decor is a welcome change from washboards and old country items that used to hang on the walls. I'm glad the aesthetics haven't changed the yummy food.  The crepes are so tasty - order them (I suggest strawberry); you won't be disappointed. Add a side of potatoes and a bottomless pot of coffee for the full experience. It'll do wonders for a hangover. Pamela's does serve sandwiches and salads for lunch (except on Sundays), but you take 'em or leave 'em - it's their breakfast menu that makes this place what it is.",

The toilets are wobbly and dirty and probably 20 years old. Also take a little care with signage handwritten signs are sloppy.   I've never been there where the place wasn't packed.

They're all great! The edges on the hot cakes are crispy and delicious. Along with the crispness, the hot cakes are soft and fluffy on the inside.   The menu isn't very large but all of the dishes are fantastic!",

The front room is pretty cute with old board games on the walls and it brought an eclectic feel to the room. I had to wait awhile before the host even noticed I was there and was directed to the main room which is more of a traditional diner in terms of decor. I ordered the famous hot cakes and was unimpressed. They were basically a little thicker than Swedish pancakes and did not really have a unique flavor. The salted ball of butter and drizzle of was the saving grace. It was just ok and I feel like the hot cakes from McDonald's are even better than this! I ordered orange juice and they. Thought it out in a soft drink cup wtf! I wouldn't waste your time coming here. Although I do have to say they have really good service and attentive servers.",

Service is fast and courteous, though had to wait to be seated. This place is popular, and for all the right reasons!!  The coffee is great. Food selection is amazing. There are omelettes and egg dishes, corned beef hash and chorizo patties. The hot cakes look incredible - strawberry, chocolate chip or banana nut for specialty options.   I had the eggs with chorizo patties. They come with potatoes and toast. There is no option to switch out toast for hot cakes but you can get a separate short stack or order a single hot cake if you want something sweet with your meal.   The chorizo patties were fantastic. Crispy exterior and spicy chorizo meat. The potatoes were creamy and delicious, great for mopping up the decadent egg yolk and chorizo. I had it with a side of tomatoes, to cut through the richness of the chorizo. But if you get toast, you can make yourself a chorizo and egg sandwich!",

She was super quick, our coffees never seemed to get low, and she brought out our food on extra plates (even though we did ask about it) to make sharing our meals easier.   My husband and I came in on a Sunday at about 11:45 and were promptly seated.  We ordered the spinach and feta omelet with lyonnaise potatoes and the strawberry hot cakes.  Both were delicious and just thinking about the hot cakes makes my mouth water.  The potatoes were quite good too, slice up and fried with onions and lots of butter.   My only complaint about this place is how cold it gets if you are sitting within view of the door.    Pamela's is cash only, and for whatever reason on Sundays, does not serve their lunch menu.",

They are just as incredible as all the other reviews have described!  They are soft and moist on the inside yet crispy on the outside ends. So good!

They were really loud, and stood in the aisle between tables.  At one point one woman sat her butt on the edge of our table and was about 6\" from my face.  I had to ask her to move.  The staff said nothing to them, but that may be because we heard it was an employees wedding party.  Unfortunate that they don't care about their other patrons.  When the woman at the cash register asked me if everything was ok, I said the food was good, but being next to that party was terrible.  She acted like I did not say anything.  I guess when you get the great reputation that Pamelas has, you no longer care about what got you there.",

The strawberry ones with sour cream and brown sugar are insane and quite possibly addictive. I want to try the banana ones sometime too, but I just love the strawberry ones too much!  Everything else I've had here was kinda gross...especially the bacon. Maybe the worst bacon I've ever had. Like, even worse than the bacon at Eat 'n Park.

I will say that our food arrive quickly but after tasting it I really think the cook could have taken a few more minutes to make it palatable. I had Gail's Favorite Eggs...which we're definitely not my favorite. A very meager portion of scrambled eggs with 2 hunks of cream cheese thrown on top and sprinkled with scallions. I wasn't sure what the purpose of  the cream cheese was as it neither was incorporated into the eggs or did it melt on top. The toast was barely \"toast\" and was limp and kind of soggy. The 'famous\" Lyonnaise potatoes weren't anything special....just run of the mill mushy diner potatoes. Not crispy or flavorful at all. My two daughters had the Tex-Mex omlet which was unremarkable save for the chorizo. Again, soggy toast. my daughters boyfriend had the corned beef hash which he said was fairly good but he felt that he only got about 1 egg scrambled with it. The only breakfast we all thought was good was my son's strawberry hotcakes. They were sweet and light, much like Swedish pancakes. I honestly can't say this place was worth the money. A bit pricey for average diner fare, We arrived well before 11am so we really didn't wait more than a couple of minutes but I'm told the wait turns long after then. We won't be back.",

The waitress was young and maybe a bit over-attentive -- she frequently interrupted our conversations to ask if everything was okay, which is a pet peeve of mine. Other than that the other servers were mostly pretty young college kids, a bit apathetic and talkative, but I can let it slide.  We'll definitely give this place another go in a few weeks!

While waiting for a table, another pair was seated ahead of us. I pointed out that we had been waiting longer than they had, and the hostess yelled at me, saying that if I had a problem, I should go elsewhere.  I probably did have an edge to my voice, but this was an insane overreaction.  I asked to speak to her supervisor, who just shrugged.  She clearly didn't care. So we left. Judging by other reviews here, I really don't think Pamela's cares about their customers.  The President ate there, so that's all that matters.  Like I said, the Shadyside location is fine, but I'm not going back there.  If you care so little, what are you doing behind the scenes?  They also count money and then serve food.

They are all completely overrated.  The food is not worth the long waits.  Their omelets come with American cheese which tasted like Velveeta. Gross.  I had no idea or I would have ordered something else.  They also screwed up our order (this happened at the other locations, too) and my mother got the wrong omelet.  We didn't care because we have waited so long for the food to come.  All of the tables were filled with people just waiting for food.  Their kitchen is completely overwhelmed with the amount of orders.  Lyonnaise potatoes and french toast were ok, but not enough for me to ever come back to a Pamela's anywhere.  Seriously, why do people like this place?  Bad service, average food, cash only and huge crowds.  Oh and they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  I would rather wait for a table at the Dor-Stop in Dormont.  That is food worth waiting for.",

    "text": "Pamela's  It's very rare that I eat breakfast out, the reason being is that most breakfasts served in restaurants are so basic or banal that they aren't worth paying for. The ones who have special items charge ridiculously high prices and having been in this industry for over 30 years I get repulsed at paying such exorbitant amounts for food that has such a infinitesimally low food cost.  With that being said I can honestly say that Pamela's is a breakfast restaurant that I would frequent often if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their service was fast, no that's wrong it was faster then fast, drinks order, drinks, food order, and bam food on the table. We were never rushed but the speed was phenomenal. Also a special shout out to our server, a professional waitress, probably been working tables for 40 years and it showed - in a great way.  Super friendly, offered spot-on suggestions, and just made for a great pleasant start of a day. Thank you so much for being you.  On to the food, we had the Chorizo omelet, filled with chorizo, sour cream, cheese and avocado, mildly spicy but good, the Lyonnais potatoes were not mushy or greasy and had some nice caramelized corners to them making them something I would serve at our house. Two slices of toast accompanied this feast and it filled me up.  We also tried the banana chocolate pancake, which is more of a crepe style pancake stuffed with bananas and chocolate chips of course a dollop of whipped cream on top. Again a very filling dish, but oh so good.  Pamela's is really a fancy diner - there menu is not extensive, but what we had was good and the value was there. Overall damage for two plus drinks under $20 with tip. Wow a typical diner experience in Spokane  would have set us back at least $ 25 and the food would have been mediocre and the service average.  5 Stars because it's been one of the best diner experiences and best values I have had for breakfast in a long time.",

From comfy and gritty city diner to garish comic-book/Andy Warhol-esque ugliness.

They get one star b/c they only take cash, making this a great place to meet a friend, if that friend is visiting from 1981. Seriously... who carries cash anymore?  There should be a big sign on the door \"cash only\", but instead, they get you in and tell you after your meal. After you have a moment of embarrassment, they direct you to a nearby ATM. So your omelet and coffee now cost $8 + $3 ATM fee + $1.50 fee from your bank.  Maybe the owners don't understand or trust financial institutions enough to get a credit/merchant account. (If so, perhaps they also keep the profits in the freezer instead of a bank account.)  Or maybe the owners are too cheap to pay the $20/mo service fee + 3% transaction fee. I asked the cashier about this, and she said if they took credit/debit, they'd have to raise their prices.  Please, raise the price of my breakfast by 3%... heck I'll even give you 10%. I'd gladly pay $8.80 instead of $8 for my omelet and coffee for the convenience - your prices are low anyway.  Pamela's staff: This policy is hurting you in 2 ways:  1)  Your are getting lower tips than you would if people paid by credit/debit - customers are more generous when paying with plastic. 2) Cash-only businesses are much more likely targets for robbery and armed robbery.",

Gotta say, burger was diner good.  Great taste, fresh bun, done just right.  Loved it.  The girls omelets were also very good.  Next day we went for breakfast before leaving for home.  Couple of us had the strawberry crepes.  Simply put...awesome!  Shared sides of the potatoes.  As my daughter says, they were bangin!  It was truly diner food with a fun, whimsical atmosphere.  Service was fast and friendly.  Would prefer the use of credit cards.  Overall enjoyed the place, we'll be back",

Worst part is that the wait is always insane (probably because the food is awesome)...and also, they don't take credit cards, which kind of stinks. However, the service is generally pretty good, and once you've placed your order, they are pretty quick to bring it out. Waiting to be seated is the hardest part. They're usually packed between 10-2 on weekends, but if you go at that time on a weekday, you'll have no problem being seated. Remember that they're only open for breakfast and lunch!",

    "text": "Good food!! But... Don't let a coupon/ discount deceive you- it's overpriced for value. Okay so not gonna lie the food here is pretty good. My main complaint is the lack of transparency with pricing/coupon for here. I got a coupon for a free stack of hot cakes plain with one purchase. So i purchased orange juice. Then, our waitress told us we could get toppings and only pay the price difference. On the menu, the hot cakes are listed as $6.50. The extra toppings were 2$ more. So we both purchased the banana choc chip ones listed at $8.50, naturally under the impression that with the coupon we would only pay $2. Long story short, for something I expected to spend less than $5 on, I spent $10.15 + $2 tip. Even if I didn't have the coupon I would've spent less because I wouldn't have bought a drink. By the way-- approx 10 oz of watered down OJ in a plastic cup costs a whopping $3. All I can say is that this waitress should get a reward for getting us to pay so much but overall I'm extremely disappointed with the value and have a lineup of better places to go the next time I go out to breakfast.",

The restaurant itself is festive, with old game boards lining the walls.  There was a huge line, but they moved people through very quickly.  Not sure how, since the servers did not rush anyone.  The menu is pretty typical breakfast fare, but it's really well-prepared, and the servings are quite generous at the price.

Although the reviews will all read the same, I think it's important to note and review chain restaurants in different locations.  Factors that can potentially be vastly different from neighborhood to neighborhood include the staff and service, wait time, parking, food quality, differences among demographics in different neighborhoods, etc. With all of this said, however, I have virtually the same critique for the Oakland restaurant as both of the others I reviewed. Again, this is located in the heart of the neighborhood (like the Shayside and Strip District branches), so parking is tough right on Forbes and the place is always crowded. If you don't mind waiting a while for your table, the food here is just as good as everywhere else. The service, if anything, is a bit worse here. However, no one can deny the power of the pancake on a Sunday morning.",

    "text": "Pamela's can be hit or miss. It'll definitely be a hit if you got black-out drunk the night before, woke up next to someone you regret, and then want to eat a meal that you'll later forget. It's a miss if you're looking for something more than a heavy, grease breakfast. The hotcakes are dank (that means good, non-millennials), the omelettes are gucci, and their signature potatoes are great alone or swimming in ketchup. Pamela's is inconsistent. I've had good and bad experiences here. My buddy got \"The Morning After,\" which is their pinnacle menu item, and the eggs and all else were underwhelming. To be honest, the lunch items are better than the breakfast at this location. One of Oakland's better burgers, if you ask me.  Bottom Line: If you need a quick breakfast, Pamela's Oakland is good, but not as good as its other two locations in Pittsburgh. As a college student though, sometimes you gotta sacrifice quality for convenience.",

    "text": "Pamelas was recommended by our hotel staff and located in the heart of Pitt University's food and bar strip. We had a big family breakfast before my cousins wedding.  It was tight, but they were able to accomodate our group of 13.  There wasn't much space between tables even beforehand (pet peev)  I had an order of hotcakes, bacon ($8.50) and their prize Lyonnaise potatoes ($3.25). I was super excited about the potatoes as they sounded so good...  After the meals were coming out I saw that the stuffed crepes & omlettes  looked really good. Hmm... shoulda...  My meal was good, but not great.  I  wanted the creamy, oniony, lemon potatoes with a dollop of sour creme that I had envisioned, but received the typical side of home fries. I'm still waiting.. :(... There was plenty of street parking available at 9am on  Saturday morning.  We walked from our hotel a few blocks away.  Pamelas didn' t accept credit cards, so good thing I had my emergency $20 in the wallet. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish, but wasn't impreased.  The food was filling and not overly priced.  Based on their location and high recommendations I expected either their presentation, ambiance or flavor to be out of this world.  They delivered a good breakfast, but nothing more....",

    "text": "I've been here several times and have mixed feelings. While I think the food can be pretty good, it is overhyped. They are a little pricey for food that can either be pretty good or pretty underwhelming. It is always super crowded during weekends but I almost never go because it doesn't feel worth it to wait in line. If you need a brunch place to go to with family/friends, however, this is probably a good choice.   I feel like one of my main issues is that my boyfriend got the fish sandwich special and it was literally just a giant piece of fried fish and two buns. No sauce, lettuce, anything on top of it. Literally a plain fish sandwich. I wish I took a picture of it!   Basically, if you need a place to go to brunch this is one of the more convenient options, especially since it has multiple locations throughout the city. If you are looking for better food it is probably better to go somewhere else, especially because the Oakland one gets super busy on weekends. Also remember it is cash only but I know that the Oakland location accepts Panther Funds!",

There's an ATM down the street and in the Rite Aid across the street.   Second - I had no idea what \"Lyonnaise\" potatoes were but they seem to come with everything. I guess they're a bit like home fries but less crispy and better tasting.   Third - love the board games theme. Who knew there was a Sweet Valley High board game? What poor kid got the \"Allowance\" game as a present?   It wasn't super busy when we stopped so food came almost instantly (not kidding - it was seriously like 4 minutes). My omelette was well made and quite tasty and service is efficient and friendly. Prices are pretty cheap (everything under $10) so expect lots of students.   Not a fan of the cheap-ass jelly they're serving up. Overall, tasty, affordable diner basics. CASH only.",

This is not how anyone should serve an egg. It's confusing and difficult to eat. And their sausages were overcooked and weirdly chewy.  If you come here, order ONLY the pancakes. Everything else is a waste of time.",

The wait was really long so we were anxious to get in (which might have built up our excitement a little more), so when our name was finally called we were so excited! Our waitress was super nice, but after getting our food our spirits were not so high. 5 bites in, we were feeling a little nauseous. It seemed like a beautiful meal had been cooked, but then dowsed in a stick of butter. We got blueberry pancakes with compote, and there was a visible layer of grease on it, and same with a strawberry waffle. The food other than the added grease was delicious however, and I'm sure it would make great hangover food! I also love chocolate milk, and I must say theirs was pretty awesome!",

The restaurant uses yelp \"join the waitlist\"-- so recommend to use it. FOOD I had the banana and walnut pancakes (delicious--caution greasy) and my partner had chocolate chip and banana pancakes ( also pretty good). One side note during brunch time on weekends the lunch menu is not served. Would come back again in ever in the area and looking to cut food costs.",

The potatos served with meals are not your typical homefries but they are thin cut potatos sauteed in butter and onions. Absolutely divine with eggs and bacon. The Tex Mex Omelette comes with ample scoops of guac, salsa, and sour cream. Just incredible and the service is quick and to the point, kids working there are always nice. Pamelas Hotcakes stand out from the crowd because they are different than your typical fluffy pancake. They are thin and buttery with the consistency of a crepe. You can get pretty much anything you can think of as a topping for the hotcakes! Go there for breakfast if you're in the Oakland, Pittsburgh area!! Cash only which is annoying",

The food is okay but I could make it myself at home and make it more flavorful, unique, and for less $. It's just average breakfast food.  The atmosphere is cool, they have all these old board games all over and its a family style type diner, so I can understand the appeal of bringing family or a group of friends here but I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the food and rarely have felt satisfied after my meal - just full and meh.   There's usually a super long line each and every time I've tried to go here so it raised my expectations that much more.   They're also cash only so be aware of that.",

The strawberries were not ripe, so they were a bit sour. I didn't finish my meal, but it made me sick very quickly. I ran to the bathroom before we could leave.   Service was also underwhelming. We felt ignored. It was almost impossible to get a refill, and it wasn't even busy.   For the amount we paid, I just don't think it was worth it. This place is overrated in my opinion, and I'll probably not visit back again. It gets 3-stars because while the food did make me sick, it tasted good and the portion was on par with what you would expect.   It's better than iHop, at least.",

I was expecting a little more of a spicy kick to it, but I'm glad it wasn't very spicy. We also ordered the special of the day hotcakes (filled with apples, walnuts, and other stuff- sorry yelpers, I dont remember!). It was my first hotcakes experience, and I was impressed. It basically tasted like apple pie inside of a crepe. The portion sizes are pretty large... we didn't end up finishing all our food. I'd definitely recommend sharing. If I had to only pick one item, I'd definitely pick the Tex Mex again (but I'm more of a savory kind of gal!).   We arrived a little after noon and we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. We only waited about 20 minutes for a table- score! The service once we were seated felt a little bit rushed, but they were nice enough and didnt mess up our order.   Next time I'm in town, I'd visit again!",

They have the best potatoes (lyonnaise) - Home fries with onions and the crepe pancakes are like nothing I've ever tasted anywhere else. Gets crowded since it's in Oakland - the college hub, but well worth it. They keep things moving pretty quickly they -only take cash but I believe there is an ATM inside. You also Can use the \"no wait\" app to get your place \"in line\" - it will keep you up to date on how many Parties are ahead of you so you can time your arrival and not wait to long.

Judging from my previous experience, today omelet and online pictures, the cooks must intentionally spread a thin layer of egg on a very hot griddle and cook until rubbery, crispy, and toasty. Honestly was hard to cut with the edge of my fork. Not what I personally am looking for in an omelet. Obviously appeals to others or maybe it's just the pancakes and waffles that garner a high rating. I'm done with Pamela's.",

The waiter was very brief, even in explaining the menu or making recommendations.  One of the waitresses was walking around in grungy sweat pants like she just rolled out of bed.  There were also flies all over that I had to keep shooing away. The food was really good but it takes more than just good food to run a good restaurant that makes its customers want to come back.",

I typically go at lunch time during the week and there isn't usually a wait for a table.  I always order some sort of omelette. Today I got the Western Omelette. Seriously soooo good. Never disappointed. When we were ordering, my friend ordered a fried egg over her salad. The waiter asked a bunch of questions and then someone from the kitchen asked a question. We didn't think getting a fried egg would be such a big deal at a breakfast joint. Note: over easy and sunny side up are different!! Parking is a pain in Oakland. As mentioned above the best time to go is when school is not in session.  I always say I want to try the lunch items on the menu but keep ending up with breakfast. One day.... I will be back for sure!",

Let's be honest, there's always going to be a wait for Pamela's - on a weekend - but the wait for this one was PACKED. All families and students, which is understandable when you don't have a car and this is the most convenient location.   Not sure if all Pamela's are the same or different, but the food at this Pamela's was definitely different than the one we usually go to. WHY?? I was sooo looking forward to my chorizo hash. At this one, they just dump a pile of chorizo on top of potatoes - not what I was expecting.   At least their hotcakes are still the same..   FYI: this place uses an app that's connected (or may be the same thing) as Yelp. So you can put your name down online via Yelp (one of those stand in line functions). Wish we'd known that.   Double FYI: this place is cash only for those you all first timers!",

The orders were correct, and were way more efficiently timed than I expected.    There were a lot of complaints from our group about the servers personalities, though.  While they were extremely efficient, there was a lot of complaints that they were not as friendly as we'd have liked.  They definitely did their jobs, but they weren't as warm as we would have hoped.  This could just be because they were so rushed in making sure they delivered our food as fast as they did.    As far as the food goes, there were no real complaints.  Nothing was \"wrong\", technically.  However, I personally tried the Buffalo Chicken Pita with Onion Rings.  While it was okay, there was nothing special about it.  Was there something wrong?  NO.  Just not all the hype that I expected.  Portion wise, I was under the impression that the portions were large from the way the server explained to everyone sort of condescendingly about \"you're ordering a lot of food bro\" to people who ordered meals with extra sides...On my end, I did not experience this.  My plan is to go back and check out the breakfast items, as that seems to be what more people gravitate towards to.  I do look forward to this, and hope to update review.  I also hope to find that service will be more friendly when there is less of us.",

If you're feeling hungry, get the morning after special and upgrade your hotcake to a specialty hotcake!                ***THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY***    Pamela's is a really popular breakfast spot so you'll have to be smart when you go here. Weekends around 11 am are going to be really busy, so if you want to go at that time prepare to wait or use the NoWait app. The NoWait app allows you to essentially save your place in line before you get to Pamela's and it has been really helpful every time I've used it. It tells you how many people are ahead of you. Just notify the host when you arrive. If you go at slower times like weekdays there isn't usually much of a line. If you need cash, there are a decent number of ATMs in the area because of the university. Alternatively, you could ask for cash back at the Rite Aid nearby.",

They are known for their Lyonnaise potatoes and crepes, and so that is what I recommended to the group. The lyonnaise potatoes are creamy, oniony, deliciousness. I did wish that mine had more crispy parts - those are my favorite! The crepes are buttery and fluffy in the middle, but with really good crispy edges!  I opted for lunch and made a mistake. I didn't find the club sandwich particularly good. The turkey was thick cut rather than deli meat, but it was kind of dry. They also put pickle slices on top of the bread, which made the bread soggy.   Everyone else enjoyed their food. In terms of non-standard items, my husband really liked the chorizo hotcakes!",

The food was very good (the Lyonnaise Potatoes were excellent!) and the staff was friendly, but they ONLY accept cash (I actually had to run across the street to the drugstore to use my debit card and get cash back so I could pay our bill one of the days) AND they don't have a pepper grinder on the table.  This might seem nit-picky, but freshly ground pepper is absolutely necessary to take an omelette from good to outstanding.",

I typically get the hot cakes which are a mix between pancakes and a crepe.

What wasn't good was the potatoes!! They were amazing the first time around and we were determined to get them again. My family and I split a plate because the server is rather large. We ate about half then all 3 of us got nothing but mouthfuls of salt. It was disgusting. When we complained we hardly even got an apology. Very much felt like we weren't too important. For the prices they charge I guess I expect better. Don't think we'll be back.",

Another problem? Virtually every dish was basically drowning in salt (potatoes, eggs, hash, omelettes, you name it). I mean the food was so salty that the salt was all you could taste. Also, my omelette was so overcooked that it had a rather tough skin on the outside and just tasted terrible. A fruit bowl, meanwhile consisted of just bananas and strawberries and the berries had some weird, sweet glaze on them. Gross. I don't think anyone in our group liked their food, probably the best was the crepe pancake but even that was only passable. Don't believe the hype--this is a must avoid.",

There are a lot of other good choices, like the Tex Mex omelet or the Croissant French Toast, and as I said above the prices are pretty good. The layout is odd and there is a lot of kitschy board games and such on the wall that kind of make it fun and different.  There are a few drawbacks. Their hours are short, and I've not found the help to be especially attentive. Not bad, mind you, just not especially attentive. Also, they only take cash, which is a pain when you don't typically carry cash.  This place is good enough that it is usually the first stop when we have visitors from out of town.",

I did like the large orange juice that was served in a good size cup. The waitress who took our order also brought us a pitcher of water without us having to ask, which was much appreciated.  I ordered the breakfast special that came with their signature crepe hot cakes. Bacon was good, scramble eggs were good, and hot cakes were good. Nothing really special, but a solid breakfast.  They are cash only, but that doesn't seem to be an issue considering how crowded it was, and also being mainly a breakfast/brunch establishment understandable since it probably won't run you more than $10-15 per person.",

If I can't get breakfast for dinner, you don't belong anywhere NEAR the diner category--and at Pamela's, you can't get ANYTHING for dinner, because they're not even open.  So change the name.  Now onto the food.  When I first moved to Pittsburgh, I couldn't wait to try this place.  I love brunch, and the rave reviews had me salivating.  And my first trip was pretty good!  The stuffed crepes are really tasty.  The line on weekends is out of control, but I thought it was understandable if my first dish was representative of their offerings.  Spoiler Alert: It was not.  Every subsequent visit has been a massive disappointment.  The salads are mediocre; the sandwiches are nothing special; the sides are middling at best; and their \"chorizo\" tastes like a frozen school cafeteria sausage patty pan-fried with a pack of Ortega taco spices.  That people will wait even a few minutes for anything but the stuffed crepes is a mind-boggling mystery, and the hours people spend lingering outside these doors say more about the sad state of local brunch offerings than anything about the cuisine inside.  They do one thing well, and it's the only reason for the second star on this rating.  So if you're in the mood for stuffed crepes and the line isn't long, by all means, hit up Pamela's.  I won't be coming back until they change the menu, the name, and/or the hours.",

The crepe style pancakes are definitely the best (but make sure you split an order... one pancake each or you'll die of a heart-attack or overly stuffed stomach). The \"Morning After\" is the best deal... standard breakfast combo, two pancakes, two eggs, and your choice of a meat. If you have a normal appetite and a normal-sized stomach... SPLIT one or two between two or three people. Unless you like left over breakfast.",

I should have know from my first sip of their almost undrinkable instant coffee that this was a bad decision.  Please learn from my mistake and save yourself a stomach ache.",

I can't really criticize though, because so did I. Every item was perfect. Eggs over were cooked properly and the home fried potatoes were spot on. Surprisingly the pancakes were still delicious even though I saved them for last and was pretty full already. Best breakfast out that I have had in some time. I will definitely be back. I read a number of reviews and truly don't get all the three's.  By the way, service was friendly and attentive even during the morning rush. I love that they only accept cash or the school's panther money.",

I ordered the bacon and cheese omelette, which I've had before and enjoyed. When I started it everything was fine, but as I started to get into it I noticed that the bacon was so fatty that I had to spit it out- multiple times. I eventually started playing around with my fork to inspect the bacon and could clearly see the fatty pieces in there.   I would expect more from such a popular and well run place, as I'm sure that the fatty bacon would have been seen in prep or in cooking the omelette if the kitchen staff was paying attention.  The only reason I didn't give them a one is because the service was pretty good and the potatoes and toast accompanying my omelette were up to their usual standards.   Despite the bad experience I'm more than willing to give them another chance as they've earned that with a dozen good trips there in the past versus just one bad meal.",

I always order their strawberry hotcake with no wip as I am very self-conscious about my sugar intake.  I have been here many times with friends and they usually like what they get. Last time I have been here the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we asked her for the right change she was offended like if we are lying to her. I was upset because some one else (another waitress or staff) was staring at us like if we did something wrong and it was humiliating :( especially that I am the one who suggested Pamela's for my sister who were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time.    I have not been there since then but I really love Pamela's so I hope the management  train the employees better on how to handle these situations",

Round 2: Fresh bananas smothered in chocolate and wrapped in a buttery, fluffy, and slightly salty hot cake.  So. Freaking. Good.  It was a bit hectic going in the morning -- they have an early bird special which has really good deals until like 8am or something.

We went on a Monday morning, there was no wait, and service was excellent and quick; It was a stark contrast from how busy it can be on the weekends. We ordered: a \"morning after\" with banana chocolate chip pancakes, an omelette, and a buffalo chicken salad. All were delicious, and all were large portions.  On the salad, the house made vinaigrette was delicious, and the fries were a deliciously crunchy addition for only $1 extra. Maybe don't use all of your dressing though - mixed with all of the buffalo sauce the bottom of the salad ended up a little too wet. The pancakes were perfect- thin, crisp on the edges, and perfectly chewy on the inside. They're a little sweet with the bananas and chocolate chips added, but if you ordered that you were probably looking for sweet in the first place and will be pleased.  c a s h o n l y. There's a First National Bank ATM on the block outside.",

By 1:30, however, the place empties out, making it a perfect time to visit.  Typical Dinner atmosphere. Super casual. Very loud. Super high noise level. Prepare to talk really loudly. Cash only. Pay at the cashier by the exit after your meal.   Lunch options on the menu are not served on Sunday.  Super long food wait. Our waiter might've forgot to give our order to the kitchen. Came in to ask us if we ordered, 20 mins after we placed our order. We were starving by the time our food arrived.   Got chorizo & 2 eggs ($9.25) and corned beef hash & 2 eggs ($9.25). Hearty portions that are served with toast. I got toast substituted for tomato slices. Chorizo was good, nothing crazy. Corned beef hash with two scrambled eggs & cheese was tasty. Huge pile of hash. Well seasoned, not too salty. Enjoyed the meal.   Overall, nothing extraordinary, but a solid breakfast option. More sweet than savory options on the menu, so a good snack/sweet tooth satisfier option.",

I'm pretty easy: I want some corned beef hash or scrapple, a couple of runny eggs, and toast. Pamela's delivers.  It was a short walk from our hotel and a nice way to start our hockey day.  Busy?  Sure, but whatever.  A little patience never hurt anyone.    She Said: He and I stopped in for breakfast while the teens slept in. We were expecting it to be way busier than it was. I think we hit the sweet spot with our timing because a line was definitely forming as we walked out. My breakfast was exactly what I expect from a diner: filling and good. The tea was a notch or two above Lipton, which was appreciated. I had Gail's Favorite Eggs, and they were scrambled perfectly. The Lyonnaise potatoes were creamy and tasty--I wish I'd asked for them extra crispy, but I certainly wasn't NOT going to eat them. They were my favorite part of the meal, by far. The bread was above average, and I left with a full stomach and no regrets.  Potty Points: No trip to the potty for me on this visit!",

The crepe hotcakes were a must have and they are delicious. They are a hybrid of pancakes and hashbrowns. We also ordered the chorizo with baked potatoes and a vegetarian omelette. Both of these were also excellent but heavy. Overall, a good brunch place, hearty food and great service.",

I love love love love love their breakfast home fries and have been tempted (on several occasions) to order just a plate of their potatoes. SO GOOD. The rest of the food was just okay. I got the chorizo with 2 eggs and wheat toast. I think they're slightly overpriced for diner food AND also for being cash only.   We each ordered something different and though we enjoyed our food, the service today was really bad. It was busy but one of us had asked for OJ and the waitress totally forgot about it. Another waitress had to take our orders because our original waitress was preoccupied. And then when we wanted a box to take our leftovers, it took for freaking ever to flag down anyone to ask for a box.",

Pamela's is the only one I know that is close to Oakland and I've heard so many good things about the place so I took him there. We got there around what seemed like rush hour for breakfast (around 11:30) but we only had to wait about 20 minutes before being seated. For how busy they were, they were very speedy with helping us get our drinks and ordering at a timely order. They have so many great things on their menu but I knew I mostly wanted eggs and bacon so I went with their Morning After Breakfast Special with hotcakes and my friend got their Western omelet with potatoes. It was a very delicious meal that we both enjoyed. The hotcakes are pretty thin but big and come with two so it's still pretty filling. It would have complimented greatly with some Nutella. I tried my friends potatoes and was extremely impressed. The addition of onions and spices they add to the potatoes give it a great taste. It was a relatively cheap meal as each of ours was less than $9 and came with a lot of food. I see now why so many of friends like this place so much.",

They were able to seat us immediately, though we almost had a wait. The hot cakes here are amazing! We had strawberry, blueberry (the special that day), chocolate  chip, and banana chocolate chip. All were amazing and topped with freshly made whipped cream. Serving sizes were hugs, so plan to share if you have a smaller appetite. Service was fast, efficient, and courteous. The only negative is that they are CASH ONLY, so make sure to have enough with you. (Expect about $15 per person for meal, drink and tip.)",

I'm visiting from San Diego but no matter where your from they make you feel at home. The food is very different so it doesn't feel like just any other diner. I got the the roasted turkey breast sandwich. It was good enough to enjoy but the bread wasn't as fresh as it should've been. It was cold turkey between hamburger buns with lettuce and Tomato with a side of fries for $9. I just think they could have made it a lot better, although it was still enjoyable. We also got a turkey sausage and egg sandwich that was simply delicious. I definitely still recommend this place, great for a late breakfast or early lunch. Enjoy :)",

The atmosphere i.e. the board games and trivia questions on the table, are great ice breakers/discussion points when we're done bitching about work. The food is always satisfying. I love that one of the side options is tomato slices, a healthy alternative to hash browns. And the prices are great as well, so it's never an issue for our group to have to wait until the next paycheck before we can go.

    "text": "3.5 stars, really. When we were in college, Pamela's was THE brunch place of choice, and I doubt much has changed if you're a Carnegie Mellon or Pitt student. But now that I've been out in the adult world, I have to admit that Pamela's is more about the nostalgia than the food for me.  To be clear, their crepes, omelettes, and Lyonnaise potatoes are fantastic. Greasy, but delicious. Everything else is fine, but nothing to write home about.  Pamela's is a Pittsburgh tradition, though, and I do think that counts for something. Don't knock it till you try it, and definitely try it once or twice. Be prepared to wait if you're going at a peak time (like brunch on a weekend) but other than that, I would say I've always had good service.  Tip: they do not accept credit cards, so be sure you have cash. Also, parking can be tough, so give yourself time to look around the side streets for a spot.",

We went as soon as it opened and were seated, served, and ate pretty quickly.  My dad loved his pancakes and was surprised when he got flat, crispy pancakes instead of fluffy ones. My mom and I split the spinach & feta omelet with egg whites, toast, and potatoes. It was the PERFECT sized breakfast since we had a giant dinner the night before.  The hype around this place is worth it. Great service and atmosphere. I'm glad my parents got to experience it before I left Oakland and without the huge crowd that's usually there!",

This place is cash only, but prices are very reasonable. You can get a huge plate of food for easily under $10. My go-to's are Gail's Favorite Eggs and the strawberry specialty hotcakes.   The hotcakes are very thin and somewhat crepe-like, but the flavor and texture distinguishes them as pancakes. They are not overly sweet, and the edges of the hotcakes are deliciously crispy and buttery. The strawberry hotcakes come with sour cream and brown sugar inside. At first I was skeptical, but I was amazed when I first tried it. These may be the best pancakes I have ever had.   Gail's Favorite Eggs are topped with the perfect amount of cream cheese and scallions. I ask for my lyonnaise potatoes extra crispy. The rye roast is also very good.   I love the simplicity of Pamela's. Put that together with an awesome menu and delicious hotcakes and you're golden. I'm sure I will be back here many more times to come.",

They don't try hard to appear super hip/modern/aesthetic, but they instead have this retro interior with very fair prices and massive portions!  First, I'll talk about the hotcakes. I've only tried the strawberry one, but it is absolutely delicious. If you have a huge sweet tooth like me, it's a must-try! I just think it's a little too heavy/oily so you will definitely have a food coma afterwards.  Second, the omelettes are sooo filling. There are a lot of omelette options and they range from classic (like the corned beef & swiss) to unique (like the Tex-Mex). Both are very well made with generous amounts of food. And it comes with a plate full of 4 pieces of toast (white, rye, wheat - so many options!) and potatoes!   Each entree is around $10 which I think is very good for the amount of food you get. Plus, the staff have always been kind to us whenever we went. The main downside is that it is cash-only, so make sure you visit the ATM before you eat here!  In summary, come with a friend and share a sweet & savory dish. Both are heavy but satisfying!",

It's always busy especially on the weekend so make sure you come early if you don't wanna wait too long. They have a new system where they put you on an electronically list so they can text you when they're ready which makes it a lot easier. Always remember that they only take cash!   Now to the food...I would say my eyes were bigger than my stomach but honestly I ate most of my food. Always make sure you get the breakfast potatoes; they were a little more mushy this time but still super delicious! Their hotcakes are unique; they're super thin but this makes it perfect for when they add things like nutella and bananas and other tasty things. I will say when you start adding on a bunch of food it definitely gets a little pricey for a diner, but I will keep coming back whenever I'm in town!",

Oakland's one is obvious more vibrant and colorful, whereas Squirrel hill location offers some homey and classical-diner vibe. There is no superior one. I enjoyed both.  Second, the food. I always get the omelette. Both locations have generous serving size, which would certainly leave you full for the entire morning. I would say the veggies in my omelet was more thoroughly cooked and well-seasoned in the squirrel hill location than in Oakland one. But no one cares about vegetables for breakfast that much so I still love my omelette in Oakland location.  Finally, the service is impeccable. You pay at the counter but they will take good care of you. Bottomless coffee mug IS bottomless. I obviously over-caffeinated after eating there. But I guess that speaks to how frequently my mug got filled.  Anyway, Pamela, it is Pamela. Whatever people say, I've got to bring people visiting from out-of-state here to eat. All five stars for local favorite.",

We make any old excuse to schedule a group Pamela's breakfast be it a birthday, first day of spring, service anniversary, you name it! (Yes, we have a problem.) The staff are unfailingly friendly, efficient, and helpful with pushing together tables and making sure everyone's drink orders are in. A bonus are the hundreds of vintage board games displayed on the walls. They're an instant conversation starter!  I typically order the eggs with toast, meat, and potatoes. Sometimes I get the corned beef hash instead, which is super filling and difficult to finish but also #worthit every time. We like to order \"table pancakes\" (calorie free, right?) but I can't weigh in on their quality due to having a dairy allergy. I will say they look like absolute perfection though! I haven't ventured into their lunch menu much, although once during lent I went with a coworker to try their Friday fish special. The crispy giant cod fillet and double fried shoestring fries blew me away! I saw it on their regular menu, so I'm sure I'll get it again next time I want fried fish. Overall there's not much more to say about Pamela's except I can see why it's an institution here and why the Obamas graced it with their presence also. It's everything a solid diner should be without the grime and salty attitudes you sometimes encounter. Keep it up!",

    "text": "Came here on sat mid morning.  Roughly 20min wait and sounds like you can join wait list online so if then that's an added bonus.  Wait was worth it and the hype was all True.  Had croissant French toast with caramel sauce and walnuts. Just enough sweetness and lots of walnuts.  I had chorizo patty on the side. Lil spicy but with the French toast it was perfect sweet and salty and spice. My fam had blue berry and strawberry crepe like hotcakes stuffed with fruit and brown sugar and they killed it ! My younger son who is not a fan of breakfast food had buffalo chicken wrap and it was gone in seconds. Definitely tried the Lyonnais potato for the table and while I was gone for 3 min to put more money for parking, it was gone and heard it was that good. Waitress Service and host were on point and very pleasant.  Decor was fun and clean. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because the coffee was very weak and there was a dish det taste from a coffee mug on first sip.  Guess at least proves it was washed. It is unlimited coffee so maybe that's why it is weak. Other than that definitely a place to eat !",

I'm not a pancake guy normally, but you really just can't go wrong with the crepe-style pancakes... and the best sausage in Pittsburgh in my opinion.  HOWEVER, please start including a small amount of the potatoes again. Adding them as a side with some coffee and your meal is now over $15. It's more food than I can eat, but it's exclusion is a bummer! They've always (as far as I know) kept it off the menu for the \"Big Lincoln\" in Millvale, but other locations they used to be included.",

They were decent but not fantastic -a tad too much of that fried feeling.  Of the three, the strawberry was the best because the tartness of the strawberry and sweetness of the brown sugar blended well.  The banana hotcake and the plain one were sort of bland (pancake syrup did the trick, though).  The \"morning after\" breakfast special is a hotcake with eggs and meat (bacon, sausage, or ham) for $6.95 (+$2 to upgrade to the strawberry or banana one).  I asked for my eggs over medium and they were definitely over easy.  Again, the food was still decent - but I could tell that Pamela's was not famous for their sausage and eggs.  I guess Cleveland wins over Pittsburgh in brunch.",

Once you enter the restaurant, you immediately notice the board game wall decor which makes the place look uber colorful. No complaints.   We decided to try the strawberry hotcakes and the corned beef hash omelette. The hotcakes were different. I was expecting pancake-looking food but it came out as more of a crepe-ish hotcake texture, which I liked. The batter wasn't thick and the combination of the sour cream, strawberries, and whip cream were delish. The corned beef hash omelette on the other hand was pretty ordinary.",

Many a times I have been for breakfast and my go to is the chocolate chip pancakes with bananas or the pancakes with strawberries and sour cream both delicious. On my past visit I went for lunch- my first time trying lunch but you can always get breakfast all day. I went with a turkey sandwich with american cheese ( really the only kind of cheese they had). When it was served it was literally slices of turkey breast and a piece of cheese on a roll. I had to ask them to bring lettuce and tomatoes for me to put on. I asked for mustard and they were out. How could that be but luckily they ran across the street to buy 2 bottles at the Riteaid. An extra star for that staff member. The sandwiches come with a choice of fries or their famous lyonnaise potatoes. Always recommend the potatoes.  The service is fair and a fun place to try when visiting Pittsburgh.",

The price is just what you'd expect a diner to be, which fits my college budget just right. The staff are very attentive and I've never had wait longer than 10 minutes for my food. The coffee is good and the atmosphere is fine; they play a lot of classic rock and oldies, which much better than any of the new music being played at other restaurants around the Pitt campus.   Lunch is good, too. Pamela's a good selection of salads and sandwiches. The chicken salad comes in a big bowl with fries, and it's very good. Now I'm not a pancake person, so I can't vouch for any of the hotcakes or crepes or whatnot, but all of the other breakfast and lunch food is good and homemade. In short, Pamela's is a good, family-owned restaurant that has excellent food and service for a reasonable price.",

    "text": "Brunch is my favorite meal of the day, so of course I was scouting for a nice spot for our first morning in Pittsburgh. Per the suggestion of my co-worker's [native] friend, we decided to check out one of the Pamela's locations. We knew we found it when there was a large crowd waiting in front of it. It was a bit deterring but the restaurant was so highly suggested that I wanted to go for it anyway. Turns out, the wait was only 20 minutes long. When there's a crowd that big outside of popular Atlanta eateries, it's usually at least an hour and a half wait! Twenty minutes gave us enough time for a casual stroll around the block and back.  There are two seating areas inside - the game room, and.. the other room. Not sure what it's called, but we were seated in the gaming room and I was glad. This room is very interactive, with old, classic board games pinned up on the walls, as well as classic trivia / card games on the tables for patrons to play with. Talk about nostalgia! Guess Who, anyone?  Looking around after we all ordered, I noticed that a LOT of other people were leaving without finishing their meals. I figured that either the food wasn't good or the portion sizes are monstrous! Seeing as how packed the place was, I assumed the latter.  Food wise, I was actually a little disappointed, at least in what I ordered. They're apparently pretty famous for their hotcakes, even Obama likes 'em! So my mind was made up and I ordered the banana walnut hotcakes. The insane amount of crushed walnuts inside ended up making everything taste really try. And their portion size is indeed massive. My order came with two giant hotcakes, of which I could only stomach one. The beau ordered the tex-mex omelet which I thought was delicious! We both agreed that they could have done with a lot less salsa though. Definitely get the lyonnaise potatoes as your side. The other guys ended up ordering the other items I considered getting, so I got to mooch off them. :)  Warning: cash only!",

    "text": "Pamela's is a local chain that my wife had heard great things about and really wanted to try. I had been once before for breakfast, and overall had pretty good, experiences.   Me, my wife Carla, and 11 month old son went for brunch, around 11 o-clock. It was Pitt's first weekend back, so there were plenty new college students, their parents, and people who had come into town for the Steelers pre-season game.   The wait was long, but it seems that Pamela's is known for this and this was to be expected. Initially when I asked about the wait I was told, \"don't worry, no too long.\" 15 minutes later we did have a seat with plenty of space for us and our 11-month old. Everyone was very nice, friendly, and helpful.  For this visit, I tried the Tex-Mex omelet (sans chorizo) which was very tasty, if not presented very nicely. It basically looked like mush but frmo a taste standpoint had just the right blend of salsa, cheese, sour cream, and guac to taste good. Come to think of it, it's probably impossible to blend salsa, cheese, sour cream, and guac and not serve it looking like mush.   Carla was excited to try the \"hot-cakes\" that all the employee's T-shirts raved about, and she tried the banana walnut. I tried them, too. While I thought they were tasty, Carla's complaint was that they really didn't seem like pancakes at all. I have to agree. They looked more likely slightly thicker and slightly crispier crepes, right down to being served wrapped in a cyclindrical fashion with the banana and walnut stuffed inside. There was a ton of walnut and banana, though, which was nice. Carla tends to enjoy thick, fluffy pancakes, so they were a bit disappointing.   Leo had a single scrambled egg, which they were kind enough to make. He seemed to be a fan, which is new since he hadn't enjoyed scrambled eggs, yet.   The price was reasonable and the service  was friendly, accurate, and prompt.   Overall, we'd potentially come back to Pamela's, though I might want to try one of the other locations that has been better reviewed. As we're still getting to know the breakfast/brunch scene, this place wasn't half-bad.",

We used the No Wait app and it helped. Our server Jordan was awesome (and cute)!   We ordered the Croissant French Toast, Pamela's famous pancakes, lyonnis potatoes, eggs and bacon. Our bellies are very happy!!! The pancakes are like Swedish pancakes just alot bigger.   My only criticsm......Offer REAL Maple syrup and honey as options. Even if there's an upcharge.",

We each ordered our meals for the morning. And I was surprised at how quickly the order came out. I would have expected 10 minutes or so but our order was on the table within 5 minutes.  I ordered the famous hot cakes with a side of bacon. I found the crepe style pancakes flavorful and prepared well. They are a large plate sized portion of pancakes. I had no problem finishing it and was clearly full. The thin nature of the pancakes take a little getting used to. The bacon was not crispy enough for me, but I had no problems with it either.  Server was friendly and speedy. She also handled dividing our checks up.   I would recommend this location. There are plenty of food options and they are exceptional.",

I went with a group on a busy Sunday morning, so I expected the service to be a little slow and it was. No big deal. The restaurant is small and when it's super busy like it was it can definitely get really crowded inside. I got the banana walnut hotcakes and their \"Famous Lyonnaise\" potatoes. The hotcakes were fine, they very sweet and crepe-like, as they're described on the menu. They were good, but not anything I personally found particularly amazing. Putting butter or syrup on the hotcakes makes them turn soggy really quickly because of how thin they are. The potatoes were really tasty, they were seasoned well and very flavorful. The potatoes were a little expensive for how small of a portion you get. I've definitely had better breakfast experiences elsewhere for the same price, but I wouldn't say I had a bad experience here. Just average.",

We had a large group, so it was about 30 minute wait for our table, but once we were seated our server was with us right away to get our drink orders. Once we placed our food order it was only another 10 minutes before our food was out on our table! I tried Gail's favorite eggs, and they were creamy and delicious. My boyfriend had their morning after breakfast with the blueberry hot cakes that were on special. The hot cakes are very unique, almost crepe-like, but really good. The bacon however, was a little thin and crisp. Service was terrific during the entire meal, our coffees never got lower than half a cup.  Overall it was a quick and tasty breakfast, and definitely a place to try at least once.",

I ordered the blueberry and sour cream filled crepes, and they were delicious!  My mom ordered the strawberry hotcakes and I forget what my dad ordered, but they enjoyed theirs very much, as well. The food here is diner food, so it is on the buttery/greasy side, but the pancakes are consistently good.   The decor is board-game themed, which added a playful element to the experience of eating here.  I believe we waited about 10 min. to be seated, and I don't have any complaints about the service.  This place accepts cash only, so remember to hit the ATM before coming.  Having Sun. breakfast here was a great ending to a fun weekend, as well as a way to introduce my folks to one more unique PGH eatery!",

We had family coming internationally who didn't speak much English so she was extremely kind and patient while we translated their orders. She was so good with keeping our many waters filled and never seemed impatient or exhausted by our large party!   The food was incredible and exactly what you'd hope for at a good diner. I had the corned beef hash with bacon. The hash was amazing! Salty and greasy, and really hit the spot. I also tried some of the chocolate chip and banana crepes which were decadent and sweet, super delicious.  The only thing was that they don't have tables big enough, so we had to break up into 3 separate tables. Otherwise everything way exceeded my standards. Definitely highly recommended!",

    "text": "Came here for one of their croissant sandwiches during Oakland's Restaurant Week. It was decent, with a nice portion of crab salad as well as the potatoes (not so sure what's so famous about these, they were good but not particularly memorable). I did wish they heated the croissant though. The surprising thing was that it was ready and brought out to us even faster than ordering a lobster salad sandwich at Quizno's. Probably because they didn't bother heating up the croissant. We also had another side of cole slaw which we found a bit too heavy.  Service left a bit to be desired. It was mostly efficient and focused on getting us seated, taking our orders, and bringing us the food and check at the same time. They didn't really check up on us until we got up to pay at the register.",

There was no mayo on it and my one piece of bread was brunt.   I thought the prices were a bit high for the food too.   Overall, it was good and it's a nice place to stop and eat somewhere different, when you live 2 hrs away and have a 2 hr break between Dr's appointments.",

The potatoes aren't your average hash browns but they are super yummy. The service was also very good and the food came out so quickly it took maybe 5 minutes. The food was a little greasy but I think that's just the style of the diner and it still tasted good. There also was no wait to eat which was nice even though it seemed very crowded.",

This location is on no wait, you can put down your name prior to arrival, which can save you 10-15 minutes depends on your location. When I got on no wait, it says 20 minutes wait so I put our name down. Check in was easy because we got there early, we waited for another 5 minutes. Pancake is always a must have! Potato was good too. The bacon is always my least fav here. Too thin, they should get strip meat store's bacon. Ah, some fresh squeezed juice, Then this place would be prefect!",

As a restaurant, it's not really my favorite, but it definitely still has its own charm. I'd call it three and a half stars.   +/- Generous portions. It's normal to pig out at Pamela's, but it's also easy to hate yourself a little after you're done.  + Tasty food, both savory and sweet. I like the hotcakes and Lyonnaise potatoes especially! + Lots of familiar breakfast food options, so it's a nice place to take guests to.  - Definitely don't expect to be eating healthy. Butter, carbs, and sugar are all on the menu today.  - The service has always struck me as pretty brusque. To be fair, they are constantly rushing around with the amount of people they have to serve, but it's not my cup of tea.  - You'll often have to wait at peak hours, like breakfast/brunch on the weekend.  - Cash only. You bring your check to the counter when you finish and pay there.",
