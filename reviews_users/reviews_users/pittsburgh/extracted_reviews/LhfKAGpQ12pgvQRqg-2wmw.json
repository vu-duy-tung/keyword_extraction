The food is not spicy as you would find in an Indian-Pakistani restaurant, but they can cook tandoori chicken for you.  The staff is very friendly, caring, and quick with fulfilling your order.   The only deductions is for lack of look, but if you are only interested in food, you will be in safe hands.",

Don't be fooled by the cheap, cafeteria style seating - everything at Salem's is incredible, whether you want a burger and fries, or more traditional Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food.  They have a large menu (posted above the counter) to order from, as well as about 20 feet of hot food waiting to be dished up from the counter.  Vegetarians have options such as vegetable curry, spinach, chickpeas, and hummus, but if you're like me, you want some meat!  Go ahead and try a lamb gyro, beef gyro, or some chili chicken.  They also have a great beverage selection, if you're into specialty sodas, juices, milks, or Snapple.  Salem's isn't the classiest joint in the strip, but like I said, I'll take it multiple times a week!  The prices are great when you consider how large the serving sizes are, but healthy eaters can get smaller dishes as well.",

Most places seem to treat the humble chicken gyro as an afterthought by chopping up some chicken and putting it on pita bread, but Salem's has a delicious blend of spices and is juicy even without the cucumber sauce.  Plus it's HUGE!  First time coming I got the combo with fries, but it was way too much food for one meal (still delicious, I just didn't have a way to keep the leftovers).  The restaurant itself is plainly appointed with rows of tables.  It's been busy every time I've gone, but that's a testament to the food they serve.",

Walk down the line of food and select what you want from a variety of chicken, lamb, vegetables, and rice.  I honestly feel Salem's gets better each time I go and I assure you, I've been there a lot. I frequented the original location in Oakland for many years until they closed it and built the \"new\" one.  The food and service is outstanding.  The market next door is equally as impressive.  They carry the best pita bread in the universe - Pitaland.    The interior seating isn't suitable for a \"fancy\" dinner so I wouldn't recommend bringing a first date here but if you can get past that, which you should, Salem's is a MUST.",

Their butcher shop is superb too - you can get really nice beef, goat and lamb there. They have the more interesting cuts - hangar, skirt, shank, and super fresh liver, kidney and heart (my fave!).  Great burger, kofta, shawarma and a killer goat curry.  Easy parking too - they are far enough off the main part of the strip away from the hoi polloi.",

    "text": "Holy portions Batman!!   This was my second trip to Salem's and second foray into Middle Eastern food per say and I wanted to stick with something simple.  I love me some lamb and I love me some rice.  So bam, done!   My friend, who I was with, is very educated on the subject of Salem's so I let her decide the dish for me.  I swear she said the dishes name to me three times and I still can't remember what it was called, technically.  So take note, I will be updating with the name!  I told the guy I love lamb so he dished out four BIG portions of lamb chops.  He won me over right there!   The first time I went I was a little on the fence about the place.  I ordered a lamb (of course) gyro.  It had WAY too much lamb and not enough veggies.  I like lamb, but not that much!  Plus, I think I may be used to getting them at fairs where they dump a ton of that sauce (Greek, ranch, who knows, it's good!) into it.  So this was just ok for me.   Second adventure in, success!   I love spicy foods, but I'm a mess eating them.  I cry.  I snot.  See....a hot mess.  But I still do it anyway!  So I blew my nose through the whole helping.  I seriously wolfed the whole thing down.  It was VERY good!  I know cumin is a very prominent spice in these sort of dishes but I'm not a fan of a ton of it, because then the dish gets too sweet.  It had just the right touch of it!   I always stare at the desserts, so I REALLY need to splurge soon. Hello, who DOESN'T like baklava!?  Good thing it's only a block from work.  There will be many more trips, perhaps to walk off the calories of future baklava purchases and consumption!",

I went back the next time to try their lunch counter/dinner options of prepared meals.   Fantastic.  Their chicken gyro is not a \"gyro\" but a marinated piece of chicken.

    "text": "I discovered Salem's nearly 3 years ago, after buying a Groupon for the place. When I walked in, I was suprised by the \"cafeteria\" set-up, with a large open area to sit and eat, a very casual atmosphere indeed. The menu was listed on a large board, with so many options I was overwhelmed. Most of the items listed I had: A. Never Heard of Before or B. Never Tried.  I was intrigued by the menu and everything smelled delicious, so I listened to the patrons infront of me in line, and went ahead with what they ordered-- the chicken schwarma. I had never tried Indian food before, but to me, it looked like a gyro and I was willing to try that-- the 2 ppl ahead of me liked it, so maybe I would to. At the end of the long counter of food options, was a section of dessert, so I took a piece of baklava and paid for my meal, which was just under $10. That's a pretty good deal I'd say, considering the large portions you get at Salem's. The schwarma had a mouth-watering smell-- definitely made with curry and other Indian spices and fresh, warm bread, I couldn't wait to dig in. I was suprised by the taste, it was so different from anything I'd ever had before, but I loved it! It was so good I tried to finish the whole thing, but there was no way, because it is a big portion of food, more than I could eat in one sitting. I was so satified with my meal, that I vowed to make it a regular spot for lunch if I was in the area.  Over the last few years, I've been back many times and have tried other things, but I always seem to go back to my first love, the shwarma.   **Also, the employees are so friendly, you feel very welcome there!   I'm so glad that they offered a Groupon for this place, because I would've probably never tried it & just grabbed lunch at Peppi's or something \"safe/norm\", not knowing about it, but in my opinion, the food here is better!! Try it, you will be having sweet dreams of schwarma.",

It's set up cafeteria style, with all of the selections on giant chalk boards hung from the ceiling.  It can be a little overwhelming at first, but the guys behind the counter are super friendly and helpful if you need any assistance or have questions.  I usually go with my friend Nutbar, who is a hard-core carnivore, and he always gets a lamb dish, usually a gyro or shish kabobs.  I get the falafel sandwich or the vegetarian curry.  The portions are huge, the ingredients are fresh, and everything is perfectly seasoned and cooked.  They always have a good selection of desserts, the baklava is good.  The hummus and naan is delicious.  The tabouleh is good, has a bit more parsley in it than I'm used to, but very fresh tasting.  It can sometimes be a little chaotic at the cash register, where people pick up to-go orders as well as people like me who are eating on site.  But it's always a minor inconvenience.  Everything is served in styrofoam containers, helpful because often I can't eat everything.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this is strictly a no-frills place in terms of decorating.  Dropped ceilings, rows of simple tables and padded restaurant chairs, and a few Steelers memorabilia on the walls.  But you don't come for the ambiance--you come for the food!  This is the middle eastern counterpart of Spice Island, which also has great food in a kind of basic ambiance environment.  The prices, like Spice Island, are very reasonable.  Be sure to stroll through the market after your meal--they have a great selection of middle eastern groceries and ready-to-eat food.",

    "text": "Salem's provides authentic, delicious, quality Indian food. Honestly, the food here is delicious! I'll tell you what you need to order . . . Chicken tikka masala with chickpeas and (when you get to the cashier) naan bread (made fresh). This entire meal will cost you about $12. However, this will be 2 meals, easy. The portion sizes are massive. Honestly, this place is a hidden gem. I'm half-torn writing this review because I selfishly want Salem's all to myself. It's seriously that good. What an amazing value.   The only reason this place receives 4 stars is because of the vibe inside. It's basically a high school cafeteria. That's what it feels like. But I don't care. I really don't. The food is amazing, and when you get to this level of quality you wouldn't care if you were eating in a horse stable (pungent). Kidding...   Parking is great and they even have their own little lot. They take card.   You have a hankering for some Indian food or maybe just want to take a step outside of your comfort zone? Perhaps you want to step back into your glory days of high school? Enter into the cafeteria serving pure deliciousness, which is Salem's. You won't regret that decision.",

    "text": "I somehow neglected to review Salem's, despite visiting back in Oct. for lunch.  I stopped by at around 11:30 on a Sat., and initially wandered into the Middle Eastern grocery portion.  If you're a newbie like me, note that the portion of the building closest to Penn Ave. is the grocery section--the door to the cafe is off the parking lot on the left side of the building, but can also be accessed through the grocery portion as well.  For my lunch, I decided to order a falafel sandwich with a side of fries ($7 and change, if I recall correctly).  The order took about 10 min. to be served, and the portions were decently sized.  The sandwich was tasty enough, but not necessarily the best I've had in PGH (apologies--details escape me given the amount of time that's passed).  The fries were of the lightly battered variety, but weren't fresh cut.  I also ordered a Middle Eastern soda of some kind ($2), which was a unique and refreshing way to wash it all down.  Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Salem's.  At the time of my visit, it was pretty quiet and clean, given that it wasn't long after opening.  Aside from a local cop, I was the only white customer, which is a positive sign of the authenticity of the cuisine.  During my visit, I noticed a sign stating that they offer an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet during Ramadan.  If you enjoy large portions of Middle Eastern or Indian cuisine on the cheap, I recommend checking it out.",

The pita is fresh and it is packed with goodness.   I also really love rice. They have some really great rice that is always cooked to perfection. They will even let you out some sauce from a dish on top at no extra cost. They offer free pita and fried pita with your order.   I came during Ramadan for the buffet and was also fantastic. The customer service is what customer service should be. I'm happy that I found this place. It always makes me happy to see different people from different walks of life coming together to break bread.",

    "text": "I've always been a big fan of this place but lately I've kinda fell into a love hate type relationship. The shopping mart side is great and I love the fresh meats and how they cut everything right in front of you. Now as for the food court area it's been making me upset. I was here about two months ago and I got the rice and the tikka masala. As for the same thing today and both times have been bad. The flavor is invisible the chicken is so bland and it's just not there. It is disappointing to me because it use to be the best around and it makes me wanna stop coming because it seems the quality of the food has been downgraded. As for the rice it was normal basmati rice had good flavor. One thing that's really nice is they have two different baskets at the register. One has normal pita bread and the other has deep fried pita bread and I think it's awesome that's include free of charge. I really hope things change and go back to how it was before because I think this was one of the better middle eastern food spots in Pittsburgh.",

The restaurant is cafeteria style- you stand in line to order, then you pick from a wide variety of dishes what you want to eat. It's crowded around 1:00-3:00, so come as early as you can. They also have a market next door so you can shop while waiting for your food. I recommend trying the chicken schwarma or get a little bit of everything. The saag paneer is one of my favorite veggie dishes they serve. The chicken biryani and lamb curry are good, too. Besides the food, the staff is great too. When you're shopping in the Strip and need a quick lunch, stop at Salem's! You won't be disappointed!",

But folks of all nationalities and religions come here for their tasty, filling lunches. Being more partial to Pakistani food myself, I usually get their curry-and-rice special; you can pick up to three different kinds of meat preparations with either plain basmati rice or biryani, and the vegetable of the day.   You HAVE to try the goat curry; it's rich and soulful with tender meat. I also love the creamy chicken tikka masala and the neon red chicken tandoori. It's huge and you won't need dinner after! The market is great for your Middle Eastern and South Asian specialties, as well as your various halal meats; I grew up eating kosher meat and I think halal/kosher meat tastes cleaner than regular meat. Also a really cool selection of sweets that remind me of my childhood with my nominally Sephardic grandparents. A fun gem in the Strip!",

    "text": "Several unseasonably sultry evenings ago, as I trekked on foot from my job on 39th Street in Lawrenceville to Altar Bar in the Strip District to catch Iced Earth in concert by my lonesome, I noticed a building bedecked by vibrant colors, and therefore, saw an opportunity to try a restaurant I've passed too many times over the years without stopping in.  When I entered, I saw a virtual United Nations in front of me dining in what very much resembled a cafeteria. Black people, brown people, white people, Muslims, Jews, and Libertarian Socialist Semi-Agnostic Caucasian Metalheads (well, at least one) could be seen partaking in Middle Eastern fare...as the Golf Channel (?) was on the telly.  The counter was a display of ethnic culinary glory. Pies, rice, proteins, and many spicy, exotic dishes beckoned for my attention, but I didn't want to dally, so I ordered a sandwich.   \"Hey, bra, what'll it be?\" a man, also bald, with a husky frame, moustache, olive complexion, and accent asked me as if I was an old drinking buddy.  \"I want the Lamb Shawarma with fries,\" I said.   \"You been in here before?\"  \"Nah, but I've been wantin' to stop in.\"  \"You headed somewhere?\"  \"Yeah, a concert down at Altar Bar.\"  \"Nice, man. This will fill you up. Get a fountain drink, sit down, and I'll take care of you.\"  And sit down I did, close to the counter so that my new friend wouldn't have to walk that far.  Yes, fountain drinks are self-serve here, and there's a 5 minute wait for sandwiches.  What arrived in front of me was an Arabic hamburger. The plush pita bread held chunks of a shockingly fresh, abundant, minced, moist, and flavorful lamb that oozed juices and was surrounded by pickles, tomato, lettuce, onion, and...mayo? It certainly didn't taste like the tzatziki I am accustomed to, but therein lied the charm of the sandwich. It was almost as if Salem's wanted something on their menu that would be familiar to Americanized palates, giving the everyday diner a worldly twist on fast food. Also comforting were the golden, battered fries that crackled between my teeth.   Not that I am at averse to ethnic food in the least. Regular readers of mine should know that. It's just that I was surprised at how \"American\" this shawarma came off and didn't mind at all. In fact, I practically annihilated the shawarma out of its sheer delectability, all while feeling more than welcome in this microcosm of an increasingly diversified city and nation.   And for under $10, does one really need to hit up The Clown or The Redhead?   After I finished my sandwich, one that was nearly as large as a rolled-up newspaper, I tried to stifle a belch only to get a smile and a nod from one of the employees. \"Man,I knew you'd kill that shawarma,\" I heard the man who served me say. I laughed, bid the folks at Salem's farewell, and made my way down to Altar Bar with a satiated stomach and a blissful heart.   Note: I was so full, I didn't eat again until 11AM the following morning. That shawarma kept me nourished as I fist-pumped, shouted lyrics, and dodged moshers past midnight in the hot, magnetic concert environs.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNaGPNeNVAzw&s=a2777319d1c9f79e086cc3c0c2a8ba6b0a14a47d7cc89c0fe9b68e012e3ab5a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=NaGP...</a>",

We came here near closing time on a Friday night, wondering if we could get anything before they closed. We casually asked about lamb shank, and the guy told us that we can get it when the buffet starts. Now the heating counters at the back made sense! So I guess they do this buffet on Friday nights after the regular closing time--whether this was a special event or one that is more regular on other days, I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any other signs or reading other Yelp reviews about this.  So we stayed and waited about half an hour (they didn't officially get started until past 8:20), and people kept pouring in over the next hour until the place completely filled up. At $15 a person (they price by the pound if you take out), it really was a good bargain. Most of their items are the same as on the regular menu, but what really stuck out was the lamb shank that we originally wanted. Huge bones with a lot of flavorful attached meat. What more can you want?   Some of the chicken items were pretty dry, so I'll probably avoid that for future visits. They also bring out some soups, desserts, and a salad and fruit bar. So this was a pretty standard (but awesome) buffet.",

You can tell they're very family friendly, and this is definitely a gem in the strip district! If you're ever craving middle eastern food, you need to try it!

My personal favorite dish is the lamb shawarma (sandwich, not salad). It's a huge portion of food and the cost is under $7.00. It is difficult to eat the entire thing in one setting, but when it does happen, it sends me right into a (wonderful) food coma.  Additionally, the market side is a nice little place. They have a pretty good selection of Indian/Middle Eastern spices. I've purchased meat from them a few times as well, all of which is very fresh and clean.",

The staff there couldn't be more friendly.  I get the same thing every week - Chicken Tikka Masala with double cream spinach.  As you can see from the picture, it's delicious.  The portion sizes are always massive, and you never leave feeling hungry.   Other than the Tikka Masala, I also took a bite of my sister-in-law's burger one time, which was also of very high quality.  I once had the lamb, but couldn't stray away from the Tikka Masala.  It's tender, and the sauce is amazing.  I will continue to go to Salem's once a week even when I move out of the city.  It's that good.",

My standards for Indian food are incredibly high, and Salem's meets them and then some. The Indian food, middle eastern food, pastries, and all the other foods I've tried here have been good. The tandoori chicken is juicy and flavorful, and the marinade is perfectly distributed. It tastes especially spectacular with the creamy garlic sauce they give you. The seekh kabob is amazing as well, again juicy with the perfect amount of spices mixed in. The green sauce that comes with it is light and refreshing and pairs perfectly with it. My dad got the regular meal with spinach, chicken curry, and goat curry along with the side salad and rice (a LOT of food for $8.99). The spinach is delicious and a little bit creamy. The chicken curry was good but not as incredible as the other two chicken dishes we had, and though I'm not a fan of goat, my dad LOVED the goat curry. All in all, an amazing eat that's easy on your wallet and leaves you with yummy leftovers.",

I have been wanting to check out Salem's for a very long time. For one reason or another, it took me until this past summer to have the chance to do so. I'd give it 5 stars for their wonderful peaceful murals and four stars for their good prices. However the food itself is pretty average and tasted somewhere in the region of three star quality. So it averages out to Cuatro, but I probably won't make a habit of coming back here too often. I'll need one more trip, though, to try out some of the dishes I missed, in case I missed a gem.   So, much like my gf, it's huge inside and they have lots of Middle Eastern food options, so give it a try if you love this type of Cuisine and maybe you will enjoy it.",

The vibe is so great in here with all sorts of people mixing together during the lunch rush. If the variety of foods seems overwhelming, take a friend, read some reviews, and bring an open mind to try a few things. Maybe things that look familiar!  My husband and I went and decided to split some menu items so I could try a variety of things. I really enjoyed the hot bar offerings. We had chicken tikka masala, spinach paneer, and chickpeas. The generous cuts of chicken were moist and served over rice in a slightly spicy sauce. This combination is definitely a filling lunch for one.  The naan shawarma should not be missed as well. It takes a bit longer than the items above since it comes from the grill, but they give you a number and bring it over. The shawarma sandwich is served on nann bread with garlic sauce, Mediterranean pickles and onions. The naan had a subtle garlic flavor which left me wanting more naan for sure! If you like gyros, give this a try sometime - very similar. Fries, are another must at this place too if you're a fan of perfect french fries.  Plan ahead for parking, the small lot nearby fills up quick but there's always street parking.",

The place is a nostalgia trip for someone who grew up in the Middle East and their food makes it worth the wait. Got the meat shawarma meal and was blown away by the amount of food we got. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the meat was beautifully done. I got the spinach side, which I would definitely recommend above all else as (for my Indian friends out there) is very close to Palak Paneer! The combination was unheard of but a welcome one.  Their market is a go to place for all your middle Eastern cravings like canned hummus and baba ganoush, but do it before your meal. Otherwise you'll end up in a food coma too beautiful to want to move a muscle.",

The market has a private lot where you are warned to park at your own risk but makes it handy since parking in the Strip district can be a nightmare.  On one side is the market where you can purchase all types of meats and canned goods, etc to prepare and Indian style meal. The other side is cafeteria style where you can order meals, salads, gyros, or sandwiches.  Since I was having lunch with my son he ordered his favorite which was tandoori chicken and chili chicken. It came with vegetables and an Indian rice platter. I decided to settle for a lamb gyro since there was a sign that stated \" if you are ordering a prepared entree please allow 10 minutes.\" This is just a heads up if you are on a lunch hour as my son was. Cards and cash are accepted. If you order a sandwich or gyro then for a slight upcharge you can get French fries and a beverage of choice. You can order as take out as well.  First of all portion sizes are enormous! For Indian food yes it is very spicy including the vegetables that caught me by surprise!  The lamb gyro was just okay but I really enjoyed the French fries! My son and I were sharing our dishes and believe me we both ended up taking food home with us.  I would recommend that if you come here then as another reviewer noted bypass the gyros and prepared sandwiches and go for the authentic Indian food. Most of these foods are very spicy. However, I must say that you'll never go wrong with their French fries. They are one of the best I have anywhere!",

Once you go in, just get in line to order. I was a bit overwhelmed the first time I went since they have so many options in the case and the menu hanging. They are also usually pretty busy. You can eat in or take out.   I ordered their chicken biriyani which they had in the case and then ordered lamb biriyani which they said would take about 15 min to make. It was totally worth it because that biriyani had so much more flavor than the one in the case.   Since it was takeout I just asked for sides of the chili chicken, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and lamb curry, because they usually just put it over rice. Also I recommend getting their naan, it's huge and fresh. All their dishes are pretty good and are great for take out. Prices are also very reasonable for the huge portions, you will definitely have left overs!",

    "text": "We are not Muslim so this place was previously out of our sights, but my daughter's friend recommended this place to us so we gave it a shot. Parked nearby and entered. Line was long but moved quickly. I got the lamb curry, the staff were all friendly and professional and the food was done quickly. I thought it would be a small sit down restaurant with menus etc, but this place is like a one-store food court - lots of tables, row of counters up front, order up front then take your food back with you or they promptly deliver certain foods. We found a table and dug in. The Chili chicken was good. My lamb curry was fair, kind of dry and there was a lot of rice. Not too spicy. However, I didn't realize that the food came in little styrofoam boxes and they are packed to the brim, so in general, it was a little too messy for me. Also, they are served with or on the bone and with plastic utensils, which complicated eating them. Naan was delicious and easy water refills were a plus. I guess in general, this place seemed like a tight and heavily ethnic restaurant so it was a little confusing and different for us. I'm sure that it is a great place if you grew up with that type of food and culture, and I'm glad we tried it.",

    "text": "Thank you to Yelp for helping me find this place while visiting for the weekend to watch a Phillies, Pirates Game back in April. Such a cool little place, I wish I could visit more often. Cafeteria style food on one side and an awesome market on the other side where you can watch them butcher your meat right in front of you. They have a fairly extensive collection of middle eastern food products.  The food was fabulous. My wife and I had shawarma's and they were up there with the best I've ever had, and soo filling. They were great for a day of sighseeing. I always kinda worry that the staff in this type of place can be kinda indifferent and/or just make you feel awkward but these guys were super friendly. Also, they had these Lebanese non alcoholic malted fruit beverages called \"Laziza\" which were amazing! Its basically like a soda but not as sweet. I can't find them anywhere here in the Philadelphia and am definitely gonna get a couple cases next time I'm in town.   Even if you're not looking to buy any goods from the market you should pop in and take a look... unless you're squeemish about seeing full animals with no skin. Lots of fun stuff over there. I can't wait to come back",

It started when i agree with him for 4 dishes for $400 and i told management that on Saturday some one will pick up the meal. On Saturday my friend went to pick up the order and the management played him and told him that they didnt make the meal but they will give another one for $477. I was really angry for playing me and cheating on my friend. My friend agreed to pay the extra money so he would get the meal so the invited people can eat. At that time when my friend picked up the meal, i called the office to get explanation. He said i saved your situation and get another sheep for extra money\" i was like what without telling me or calling me\"  i said to him my deal was $400 and not $477 , he said i ll give you credit for $77 at that time i knew he stole my money. I told him i need my money cash not credit he said i wont pay anything. This whole story was lesson for me and i wont back to that thief and liar manager. Be aware Saudi students in Pittsburgh and Indiana not to order from this dude in Salem halal",

I ordered the Chicken salad - the meat some well spiced, soft, and juicy. The only reason I didn't get 5 stars is because I like romaine lettuce over iceberg. But I can't complain too much, because they give you 4 servings of chicken on your salad. Well worth the $6.   Space: You couldn't tell from the outside, but the restaurant is a huge cafeteria like space. You are sure to find a seat for a large party. But the ambiance could use some work!   Service:  Fast, polite, accommodating. There is nothing to complain about.   I went around 1PM on a Thursday and it was fairly empty...though many people were buying TO GO. I think it's still a hidden gem for downtown!   Also the meet is Halal / Kosher.",

I just had to write this review because no one has raved about their personal-pizza sized pide (i think they call it something else, but I call it pide). They make the bread there baked with several types of filing. I tried several--but i have to strongly recommend the spinach and feta! The spinach and feta pide was so delicious that I thought about it all afternoon after lunch, and knew it would only be right to go back here for dinner.  I wish I lived in pitt just so I can go here for lunch AND dinner. Still thinking about that pide.   They have plenty of other food that are also so delicious.  They know how to cook here. Chicken breast can easily go dry and and lamb sometimes tastes very lamb-y and chewy. But that was not the case here. The tandoori chicken had fire but not at all oily that the spices lingered in your mouth even after brushing your teeth. Actually I wanted to keep eating just so that flavor would remain in my mouth. The lamb kebab was kebabed to perfection.Go ASAP and get a platter, and several of the spinach&feta pide for later and the next day. The price is right and a platter portion is more than enough for two people.",

You will definitely not be impressed with the cafeteria style atmosphere, but it is comfortable and you are there for the food, not the decor.  Speaking of food, you get a ton of it for a great price.  The 2 curry, rice and vegetable combo is my favorite way to go.  I've had enough food to either indulge myself in one sitting and not have to eat another meal the rest of the day, or eat half, and then finish the rest as another meal later in the day - pick your poison.  The best thing in my opinion is the chili chicken.  The beef and chicken samosas are delectable and the wraps are delicious too.  The people working there were pretty nice as well.  Sometimes, they run out of a certain popular item and need to make a new batch, but they will bring it to your table as soon as it's ready to go.  Shame I only found out about this place during my last few months in Pittsburgh, or else I can see myself eating here at least once a week on the regular.",

From my experience everything's been fresh during morning hours and lunch time, towards evening time (or closing time) I would rather order something fresh off the grill like a cheese burger or sheesh kabab.

If you enjoy eating at roadside stands in third world countries (I do, honestly!), you'll probably like Salem's. The food is wonderful, authentic, using genuine spices and halal meat, and there are many dishes you won't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh (Goat and chick pea curry, anyone?). On the negative side however, it looks like a former Salvation Army cafeteria, complete with plastic trays, and you'll be eating off foam plates with flimsy plastic forks. While you're there, you can enjoy people-watching; it is popular with immigrants and visitors from a number of far-away countries. Before you leave, be sure to stroll through their store next door. The butcher shop is scary for some people but this is real meat, not the machine-processed shrink wrapped water-logged stuff they sell in WalMart. Some people are bothered however by animal parts that look like.... animal parts. Bottom line, think of it as an anthropology field trip and you can't go wrong. Your taste buds will be rewarded and you can pat yourself on the back for being so open minded.",

What I found was an amazing selection of halal Middle Eastern & South Asian cuisine, and a vibrant community. I went with the tandoori chicken kebab w/ biryani rice & salad. Everything was fresh and very tasty. Also, the portions here were very generous, and the prices were great. The service and ambiance were very nice as well.

During these times, it's a buffet, and the hall is filled with people sharing the meal. Very warm peaceful loving vibe, many families, all kinds of people, even us. During the Friday night in Ramadan, two prices only:  adults & children. (Takeout $11.95/lb I believe) Help yourself as much as you like, 8PM to 10PM, drinks not included. We each got a fountain drink and went to TOWN! Ever notice that unprocessed whole foods fill you up so fast?! Decided on a new favorite dish, this delicious spicy with crunchy, everything happening chick pea salad! Might be my new go to for lunch!",

    "text": "After waiting for a while in a fast paced line, we ordered Kufta and Lamb Shank for the main course and Pistachio Bird Nest for dessert.  The food was delicious. The portions were huge. Kufta was too spicy. I like spicy food. However, I think that a restaurant should mention on the menu when a dish is more spicy than would be expected. This is the reason that I deducted one star.  The service was good and fast. Of course, considering the self-service nature of the place and especially this very fact that no tips are asked or expected.  Certainly, this place is not a good place for a date or sentimental meeting. But a good place if you just want to try a huge middle eastern meal with a decent cost.",

    "text": "Five stars, easily. I've been to Salem's over a dozen times and I'll never stop! Here's what I love:  * FRESH grilled meats! SO MUCH flavor! So much everything! The shish tawook is my favorite, and it's perfectly grilled every time. But I also regularly stuff myself with the buffet meals. Two meats and a side on a heaping bed of rice. (SERIOUSLY heaping. The portions are massive, and I'm blissfully bloated after every Salem's binge... ahh...) I recommend the tandoori chicken and grilled chicken with saag paneer, and a side of hummus. DO get the hummus! Made fresh, in house, with a wonderful nutty flavor and none of that sabra citric acid preservative crap. Bleh. But yeah, delicious local quality flavor all around.  * The sauces. Hummus, yogurt, garlic. I love them all. Does that make me basic? Yeah probably. I order extra sauce and extra pita chips (delightfully light and crispy!), and I eat up everything. This is much to the annoyance of my partner, who then has to deal with me flinging foodstuff all over the place and farting garlicky fumes through the night... but it's a worthy price to pay for the deliciousness that is Salem's :)   * The people! I've only been talking about the food, but gosh the people here are so nice. Seriously, they make everybody that enters through their doors feel like a member of their family. Shoutout to Mustafa! Most contagious smile out there! I see so many families visiting for meals, groceries, parties, prayer... just everything. People depend on this space.  Salem's is no longer just a restaurant to me. I mean it's also a market, obviously, but it's so much more than that too. I can't imagine a Pittsburgh without Salem's. It is a pillar of the community.",

Personally I'm sad I haven't been here sooner!   The grill area is counter service. You order with one person and pay at the counter. They will give you a number once the food is ready. Depending what you order it might take 10-15 minutes.  We went on a Tuesday evening and it was PACKED. Worth the wait though.   I've tried their shish lamb kebabs and the Kufta kebabs. The basmanti rice is fluffy and seasoned and comes with a side.   It is enough food to split for two meals.  Will be coming back again for sure.",

    "text": "OK, so this place gets 5 stars for flavor, but I HAD to deduct two stars for a very important issue, which I will get to at the end.  We came here for a friend's birthday celebration, and it was the first time we had actually been in - I've always glanced at this place as I was driving into town through the Strip, and wondered how things were. The good news is that the food is super tasty. I think we had a shawarma and a combo platter with chicken tikka, falafel, and herbed rice. It was all very fresh tasting and well-seasoned. Like other reviewers note, the portions are quite large, so I think the combo was really a good idea for like 2-3 kids or 1 adult and 1-2 kids.  The folks were very friendly when we ordered, and really made things easy for us when we were making up our minds. They brought out our food when it was ready, and that doesn't take too long at all. The cafeteria style seating makes it very practical to bring a big group and enjoy the food.  OK, so the ONLY issue we had was that after we had all finished eating, I had to visit the men's room and noticed that it was a mess, with water and paper towels all over. I'm hoping it was just a one time event, which could happen to any place, and will definitely have to check it out the next time we have the opportunity to visit. If it's fixed up, I would definitely bump this place to 5 stars for the food - it is so good.",

We love how they were both connected, the open floor plan and how the food choices were advertised on the fall with pictures. For both the market place and restaurant there was an excellent assortment of ethnic foods to choose from and the value you get for the food is outstanding. This place makes you feel proud to be a Pittsburgh Native and what Pittsburgh is suppose to represent.   The curried flavors of the curried chicken, vegetables and goat was warm, comforting, and well balanced. I particularly enjoyed the flavor of the creamed spinach although you need to be careful while you eat it so you don't accidentally swallow any of the hard seeds used to spice it! The rice was well steamed and helped carry the flavor of the sauce. Would not hesitate to order curry and creamed spinach here again.",

Both were so freaking delicious and they give you SO MUCH FOOD! Like they're literally packing the container with rice and just drenching it in sauce and I loved every moment and bite of it.  We each got a chicken and a beef samosa which are heated up fresh and are packed with meat. Even better than the samosa is the white sauce that they give you. There's like a hint of garlic to it and it's just phenomenal.  The photos don't look to appetizing but this place is definitely worth it, I swear. It's a must if you're looking for a casual dining option in the strip.",

As I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the large, orderly space.  I was quickly greeted at the counter, where I placed my order for a chicken shawarma salad.  After being given a number to display on my table, I sat down and enjoyed watching the activity and meals around me.  Within minutes, my meal arrived.  The lettuce was fresh, the chicken was abundant and steaming, and dressings were provided.  As I sat eating my flavorful meal, I noted the food items I saw others eating and resolved to return and try a variety.  I also noted the steady stream of people at the counter, which moved quickly for a Sunday afternoon lunch rush.  I was impressed by the smooth operation of this establishment.  Most notably, the service throughout my visit was so friendly and gracious toward all customers that I observed.  I look forward to returning!",

Got the Chicken Biryani and there was enough for three more meals. I went back and got bread and some extra cucumber sauce. Looking forward to trying everything.

They also have grilled meats like lamb and chicken cooked to order. Gyros, burgers, kebab this place has everything. Middle eastern desert like baklava are also available. The portions are large and the price is fair.  The Ramadan buffet is a special treat. Nightly during Ramadan from around 8 to around 10 they have a eat in or take out buffet. It's usually around 15 bucks.  The grocery is filled with spices, produce and teas. Great deals can be found. The wealth of uniqe and different ingredients is astounding. They have a halal butcher and will mix and preseason meat for you. I strongly suggest the spiced meat mix called kufta. They have different drinks and candy and fresh pita.   Go for lunch, shop the grocery, come back for a Ramadan buffet. You're welcome.",

Yelpers love the burgers and I can see why, uncooked patties were thick and looked great.  If I lived here I would have tried it.  But this was going to Columbus. On my list was goat curry (or lamb curry).  Chille chicken ( or the tandoori).  Side of creamed spinach for both and one regular pita and one fired pita. Huge portion sizes.  We go out of our way and brave the crazy Pittsburgh streets to come here, this last time waiting 4 hours for them to open when we really had to return to Columbus.  Yes it is that good.

I'm looking for the full package: is it unique, does it look cool, does it taste good, is there good service, was the wait long, is the staff helpful, how is the price?  But genuinely, when it comes to Salem's, the food is just so stinking good that it gets a 5 stars just for that! The rest is just a blip on the radar (though I WOULD like to highlight that it's very affordable and the staff is SO friendly and helpful). You will never find a chicken tikka masala that tastes as good as Salem's. I've actually tried and nothing compares. So much so that I can no longer order chicken tikka masala anyway because I will just be disappointed.   Is it aesthetically pleasing inside? Not really, it looks like a cafeteria. On top of that, at peak hours it can be really difficult to find parking. But I don't even mind.   The perfect lunch spot. And an instant win when bringing friends and introducing them to a new cuisine.",

The portion is huge, defiantly enough to share. I always get the chili chicken and change the other meat choice, I've got the lamb, curry, the pink chicken(I forgot the name), chili chicken is still my favorite. Maybe next time I will just get 2 chili chicken instead? Haha  The other thing we usually get is the shawarma, it is kinda like gyro, also taste great and huge portion.

The staff are courteous and service is fast.  The food is great. Pretty decent spread of offerings from shish kabobs to tandoori's to schwarma (gyro). Naans, lassi's, mango drinks, pop also on offer. I prefer to stick with the schwarma myself and it always delivers.  As for the market side, this is one of the best butchers in Pittsburgh - lamb, beef, steaks, chicken, goat at reasonable prices. I'm not strict about halal/kosher but I buy from here because I know the quality is good.",

All of the gyros and shawarma are very good except the chicken - tends to have too many chewy bits (i.e., gristle).    I've had their shish kebab once, and it was mouthwateringly delicious, and their appetizers are outstanding: baba ganoush, hummous, tabbouleh.  You can easily make a great picnic with a few of these.  (I've done it before.)  The desserts are good, but nothing really special, for a Middle Eastern deli.  (Always a good selection, though.)  Service is always friendly, but a little spotty on procedure.  Sometimes I feel like I'm being asked impatiently for my order when I'm obviously still deciding, and sometimes I feel like I stand there for a couple of minutes before someone helps me.  I feel guilty for being critical, though, because they are very friendly.  Decor leaves a lot to be desired: just an enormous linoleum an drop-ceiling cavern with a few Steelers pictures on the wall.  (Bonus points for the garish, though colorful and friendly, murals on all of the exterior walls, though.)  Parking's a bonus, too: they have a small private lot that relieves the on-street parking, so they're one of the rare Strip denizens that doesn't require a parking space hunt.",

This was the first time we have been to Salem's (It is pronounced Sah-leems', we asked the guy.)  As others have noted, it is large inside, casual, and cafeteria style.  Very basic but very clean and we will definitely eat there at some point in the future.  Selections today were all varieties of chicken and we ordered a half rotisserie chicken dinner (the chicken was gorgeous, how often can you say that about chicken???) that came with rice and veggies.  Also picked up a gyro and some spinach pies.  We shared everything, did not finish it all but tried hard because it was all absolutely delicious.    We loved it and will be back.",

All jokes aside, this is a good place, with an excellent location and a very busy, diverse flow of customers. One thing I will point out is the serving size. I wish they used measuring cups or spoons for specific servings per meal. They lack the consistency of serving portions and it's varies by worker. One will give you two scoops of rice while another will give you 3. One will give you 4 big spoons of meat while another may only give you 2. There should be uniformity when it comes to serving portions. It sucks because the amount of food you get is wholly dependent on the mood or the carelessness of the worker who fills up your container. Also the menu items are getting old, wish they introduced different items. Plus, no one serves actual curry anywhere in this country because actual curry will make your taste buds tingle and \"Uranus\" will later pay for it but your brain will keep forcing you to eat it. Why? The magic is in the spice not the food itself.",

It is done steam table style so you can look over the food before you buy so you can try different things. Try the goat meat it's really good. The decor is like a cafeteria, so fancy it's not. The prices aren't fancy either. Two can eat for about $20, including a piece of baklava for dessert.. If just rating the food I would give it 5 stars",

If you're in the mood for tasty, food and a plethora of options this is the place for you. EVERYTHING I've ever had was scrumptious! I would highly recommend this place to the burger fans. There's a butcher on the opposite of the restaurant, in the market. So the meat is fresh & halal. Then you can have beef bacon if you like a bacon cheeseburger.  Also,the spicy chicken dish, tikka masala dish and lamb shank is tasty and plentiful. The portions are enough for two or leftovers.  The people working there are informative, kind and willing to answer any questions. This is just always a nice experience m: from the vibe of the place, to the food and the friendly service.

Everyone was extremely friendly and the meat from their butcher counter was excellent and fresh. We literally saw them bringing in the day's selection.   So when we moved back to Pittsburgh and heard that they opened a new location in the Strip, we had to check it out.   The Strip location is amazing. I can't speak for the grocery side, but the schwarma, grape leaves, baba ghanoush and curries we've gotten from there have been spectacular. Everything is fresh, hot, and declious. They also give you every dollar's worth of food, along with fresh pita and pita chips.   Do yourself a favor and go eat at Salem's. Get a schwarma, a cup of their brewed iced tea, and enjoy. It's totally worth the trip to the Strip, and I definitely plan to be back.",

Ironically or rather to add insult to injury, the \"Mr. disregard to all customers in line\" (customer who took forever to order) must have ordered about 10 grill items because as I was being told that I couldn't get any grilled items, they were placing about 10 kabob items on the grill!    They should specify that the grill closes earlier and not only that be more considerate of customer waiting in line.

    "text": "Visits: Once, for lunch at the grill. Won't comment on the market, because I made no purchases there.  Food: My friend and I shared three dishes - the lamb kebab, the beef kebab, and the shawarma. The beef was reasonably good, with a decent blend of spices and a soft texture with separable strands - almost more like it'd been roasted rather than grilled. That's where the good ends. The shawarma was made of spiced ground meat, which wasn't what I expected, though I don't consider that an issue. What was an issue was that it veritably exuded oil, and somehow managed to be dry despite that. The lamb managed to be even worse. The flavor could be summed up as turmeric, with a dash of turmeric. The heavy yellow color made it difficult to tell, but given the tough, sinewy (almost crunchy) texture, I'd say it was undercooked. I remember a fleeting thought that I'd get ill from it, and sure enough, within an hour, I was wishing I had Pepto in the car. One point off for two of three dishes being worse than mediocre, and an additional point off for inflicting food poisoning.  Atmosphere: Awkward. The interior is essentially a cafeteria - columns of tables set up side by side, with a service line next to the grill. However, rather than having the low (or sometimes high) chatter of a cafeteria, the patrons were all very quiet, even couples and families with kids. It led to a strangely oppressive hushed feeling despite the dozens of people inside. I understand that this is probably not within the restaurant's control, but it's not pleasant, especially when waiting for food. One point off.  Service: No issues with service. The guys working the grill and register were plenty friendly enough.  Price: Neither good nor bad. I would've probably expected a dollar or so less per entry due to the atmosphere, but it doesn't put them out of the expected range.  Given that it made me better acquainted with the bathroom, I think I'm being pretty generous.",

Because they were so extremely helpful in the catering, that's what I'll be reviewing them for (but also go check them out for lunch or dinner and to see their gorgeous mural!)  Salem's was wonderful to work with in getting catering for half of our wedding. Due to having a mixed cultural wedding, we had our venue provide half the food (your typical boring wedding food) and Salem's did the Indian half of our food (delicious oh so goodness!).  They gave us an absolutely full tasting with all of the aunties and uncles there too. Oh man, their chili chicken is sooo good (the hem of my wedding dress will agree because it got to taste some too when I dropped a whole bunch on it... whoops!). They were great and negotiating specifically what we would need and even gave a staff member to stay with the kitchen down there to direct them on not mixing halal food with non-halal food utensils.   Instead of a Pittsburgh cookie table, we had a baklava table - it was a GREAT SUCCESS. Needless to say, all of our friends absolutely loved having this as our catering. Even if you're not Indian or Middle Eastern, you should definitely think about having Salem's cater your wedding or event if you want a very memorable meal!",

Everything was absolutely delicious and we spent under $25! The atmosphere isn't the greatest- as its kind of an old middle school cafeteria feel, but the food more than makes up for it! It gets super busy on the weekend but their service is quick and friendly. Highly recommend and can't way to go back!!!",

    "text": "The dining half of Salem's serves predominantly Indian food. The only Middle Eastern items are the meat and the chicken shawarma. I opted for the chicken shawarma sandwich which was about a foot-long and also filled with veggies and mustard. The mustard gave the sandwich an unusual yet interesting taste.  I also tried the yogurt drink. As a warning, it is VERY salty. It's interesting to try but tough to finish unless you like salt...a lot.  The market portion of Salem's has more items typical of Middle Eastern food. You'll find rice, pita, beans, and a myriad of sauces and spices characteristic of food from Arabia and South Asia. The largest part of the market is certainly the butcher's counter. (I'd like to clarify that Salem's has a butcher's counter not a deli counter). The meats are halal and priced comparable to Giant Eagle. They do sell a few deli meats but no where to the same scale at which they sell chicken, ground beef, goat, and other butchered meats.",

    "text": "Oh man, I really like this place a lot.  So far I have only tried their prepared foods/cafeteria section, but I can tell you that if you (1) like middle eastern / indian food, (2) want to eat a LOT of it, and (3) don't want to pay very much for it, this is the place you are looking for.  Service is very fast.  The food is surprisingly delicious for how little it costs.  The average meal here will cost you between $7-10, and it's a guarantee that you will not leave here hungry.  The portions are GENEROUS.  And the food is TASTY.  I love the chicken shawarma sandwich, the falafel sandwich, and many of the items in the hot food \"meals\" section (which you can mix and match and pay for a single meal).  Their sides are also nice -- delicious hummus and baba ghanouj, among others.  Realistically I think Salem's is a 4.5-star place!  And the half-star docked only because I view it as a strictly to-go joint.  The sit-down atmosphere is set up to be quick and efficient...it literally looks like a barren cafeteria.  I would probably not have a sit-down meal there with friends (although, if you don't mind the atmosphere, it is VERY easy to find tables and nobody will bother you or get mad if you're being loud).  But -- for a bomb diggity carryout place where you can order there and get your food fast, Salem's is fantastic.  I can't wait to try meat from the market, too!",

An unassuming community center-like set up attached to a market with massive portions of Middle Eastern food at a reasonable price. As an Indian person who appreciates similar flavors, I was thoroughly impressed and plan to go back at some point.   Food: Think Pittsburgh portions. Multiply by 2. That's what you get for around $10. I went for the rice and goat curry. Not a big goat fan but that dish made me one. The meat was soft and peeled off the bone. Since they made it bone in, the flavors were excellent. I would highly recommend it. My friend had the palak paneer which was equally as good. Definitely not for the weight watchers crowd and I wouldn't say it's the best middle eastern food I've had, but for the price and portions, it was well worth it.  Service: Arguably the best part of the experience here. Everyone is a \"brother (or sister)\" there, or so that's how you're addressed by the staff. I kind of appreciated that- it made it feel more homely.   Ambiance: I was on the fence about how the place is dressed up. Much like other reviewers said, it's kind of like a cafeteria or community dining hall- uncomfortable and worn black cushioned chairs, rickety tables, scruffy tiled floors and no fancy decor. They could probably do a better job keeping the place clean but the feel of it definitely fit the atmosphere as a whole. It would almost be weird to see it suddenly turn into an upscale or modern place...",

They normally put ketchup on both the burgers and cheesesteaks by default, so if you detest the stuff like I do, order it on the side, then you can make a big public display of throwing it out and go on and on about it, if I'm there, man I'll be cracking up. Hahah, anyway, aside from the grill, they have a big selection of prepared meats and usually 4 vegetarian dishes, the meats, which includes rice, are usually goat, ca few types of chicken, lamb, etc. all are completely delicious and total comfort food. A large dinner is enough for two, especially if you pick up the complementary pita bread at the register . Yeah!  The staff are all super nice, the place is always really clean, and the price is right!   I will say that the lunch hour does get packed, but the line does move pretty quickly. 6 stars!",

They also have a solid amount of Middle Eastern food stuffs and spices, so if you don't have an Uncle Samir to ship you za'atar, you might want to shop around the market a bit.  They'll cut any of their meats any way you want right in front of you and have prices that are not only affordably low, but surprising given the excellent quality of the meat. The only chicken I've had that's been cleaner and tastier than Salem's has been directly from the farm down the road from where I grew up. It's worth trying the pre-made marinades, too.  I've only eaten at the grill a few times, but was never let down in the quality or consistency of their menu. The cafeteria section is presentable (nothing to fawn over) and a fitting location to pop a squat with a buddy or two as you dig in to the feast in front of you.  This review is written with the market in mind and with the grill as an afterthought--seriously, try the meats!",

The falafel and schwarma are awesome, as is everything from the hot bar; chili chicken and palak paneer are my favorites. The service is very polite and prompt, and some of the friendliest folks around. Next door is a fantastic market with a top notch halal butcher. Don't hesitate, go to Salems.",

    "text": "YUM! I've never been to Salem's location, but have had their food many times catered at the office where I work and love it - so I wanted to give a review. I really need to visit their location. We usually have the chick pea curry, samosas, chili chicken and veggie curry. OH MY! Everything is truly out of this world. Their veggie curry has all my favorites - broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, zucchini. I love spicy food and all of this just really hits the spot. The employees that cater at our office are always so awesome. Handing out 5 stars to this place is easy. Looking forward to stopping by their shop next time I need my fix!",

    "text": "You've got to get yourself down to Salem's. This place is hands down my favorite in the city for Indian/Middle Eastern food. The ambiance is cafeteria, as other reviewers have noted. However, the food more than makes up for the unassuming digs. If you are lucky enough to come down on the right day, you can get their saag paneer, which is creamy, tasty and full of paneer cheese. If not, do yourself a favor and order the shwarma (my husband's fave) or the chicken tikka.   An interesting side note about this place- we originally heard about Salem's when we were discussing urban chicken rearing with a friend. This is one of the few places in the city limits that will process your chickens for you for a very reasonable price. What this means for you, the restaurant-goer, is that your meat is guaranteed VERY FRESH. Like, processed on the premises fresh.  Also, if you have extra time, check out their market. They have an excellent selection of meats, as well as a great array of middle eastern spices, fruits, candies, and so on. Check out their Ramadaan break-fast meals in the evening around August-October - it's basically an all-you-can-eat meat buffet for under 20$/person.  I've taken pretty much all of my extended family here at one point or another, and everyone has loved it! You have to be a bit adventurous, and don't come here dressed to the nines on your way down to a play or evening downtown - you'll definitely get some weird looks.",

    "text": "I stopped for some Halal food and decided to go with lamb curry over rice. In addition I was asked to choose a vegetable dish. I picked the spinach dish. Do not know the exact name.  Lamb is my favorite meat, however, this place was able to cook it with no flavor in it. Honestly, I did not feel that I was eating lamb. However they cook it, it does not make any sense. It has some spices in it, but could not decide what they are. The hot spice is just hot, without adding any good flavor.  The rice was plain and bland, not impressive at all. The spinach was obviously made from frozen spinach. Therefore you get no flavor of True spinach.   For $9, they filled the box with rice and put about 5-6 pcs of 1-inch lamb cubes. The amount was more than enough for a person, but without any taste, it can feed at least 3 people.  This place is lucky for not having a competition around them offering same type of food.  I also checked their market and felt sorry for whoever shops there. Their prices are unfortunately flying. These people do not deserve to sell halal. But, they will continue to this until their customers teach them they are not treated in a halal way. They can easily sell for cheaper, but they won't. Casue money is good and delicious for the. That is why they will not care about the taste of food as long as customer continue to appreciate this type of poor quality.",

For $14, I ordered a lamb curry, meat shwarma, garlic naan, and a baklava for my husband and I. These portions were generous and they did not skimp on the meat at all. I will be returning here for all my future Indian food cravings.",

The butcher section has marinated meat that's super helpful for a weekday meal. I go here once a week.",

I went back to get the correct sandwich which they were great about correcting but it was cold.  my office is literally 2 mins from the store so I cannot understand how my food was cold when it's made to order. Other than today I enjoy their food but I will not be back for a long while. It left a bad taste in my mouth",
