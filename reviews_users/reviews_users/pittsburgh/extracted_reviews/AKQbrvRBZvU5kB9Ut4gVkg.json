    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my meal at Pizzaiolo.  I had previewed the menu on-line and had my heart set on the mozzarella stuffed meatballs, which sadly were not on the menu during this visit.  I opted for the Lemon Chicken, which is accompanied by broccolini.  I asked if I could add a side of pasta, the server checked with the chef, and immediately obliged.  I received a basket of bread (not much to write home about) and a dish of olive oil for dipping.  The bread slices varied in degrees of freshness, some slices were pillowy soft, others were tough and chewy.  At this price point, I had higher expectations for the bread basket.  The entree more than made up for the mediocre bread basket.  There was a long wait for the entree, but the wait was worth it.  My entree arrived hot and delicious.  I received a generous bowl of penne pasta topped with 2 perfectly sauteed chicken breasts.  The entire entree was steeped in the wonderful lemon olive oil sauce.  Light and delicious.  I sprinkled with some parmesan cheese and proceeded to enjoy.  The highlight of my order was definitely the broccolini, which was perfectly cooked.   I really enjoyed the entree.  I really wanted to end the meal with the dessert, but options were limited to tiramisu, cannoli and gelato, so I opted to skip dessert.  I would definitely return.",

Service was not good at all. Very little attention was paid to us.  When we asked for recommendations on wine, our waiter told us that he didn't really know much about Italian wine. He actually laughed at us when we asked a question about something on the menu. When I ordered my meal using the Italian phrase (as it is on the menu), he didn't understand me. Again he laughed!   There are so many better options in Pittsburgh for great food.",

I had the margarita pizza which was very pricey for a personal pizza on lunch. There was very little fresh mozzarella to the point you didn't get to enjoy cheese. I had two piece of fresh basil on the entire pie. The basil flavor should be in every piece or every other at least. The crust was also not crispy once you got the center of the pizza. I can't say I will be going back for the pizza. You can definitely get better pizza for a better price elsewhere.",

We were told an hour wait but it was about half that. The restaurant is on the small side so we expected to wait...  Really nice lighting.  Would be great for a date, everyone looks younger in that room, I heard one of our party say.   The calamari was tender and well seasoned, one of my benchmarks for a restaurant. All other starters were what was expected with a few nice surprises.   That authentic pizza oven is one of the only wood fired ovens I know of in the 'burgh. The dough is phenomenal. Everyone at the table raved about their meals.   It's a fun location and a great place for a more authentic Italian meal.",

But I decided to change it to a 5 after concluding that the pasta is either made on site or ordered from a high quality manufacturer, which may justify the price.  Side note- the bar chairs were really uncomfortable. They were way too tall. I'm younger, so it was no problem for me. But an older lady came to sit next to me at the bar and it took her almost an entire minute and the help of her daughter to get onto the chair.",

Nice atmosphere, although the downstairs tables can be a bit cramped if there is a good crowd in there, which there was.  And sitting by the door during the cold weather is not a good choice with the door opening about every 30 seconds from people walking in.  Glad they turned the heat up for us!  Hostess, waiter, and I'm assuming manager that came over to our table to see how everything was, were all very pleasant and friendly.  Waiter was awesome, very knowledgeable and friendly and attentive.  I had the eggplant parm and my daughter had the ravioli...both very yummy!!!!  We also tried the appetizer....little mozzarella fried balls....so good they melt in your mouth!!!   Will definitely visit again next time we're in Pittsburgh!!!",

    "text": "My aunt and I went here for dinner on Thursday (third day open!) and it was great! We ordered the the Antipasto Napoli  ~ 8 types of cold cooked and seasoned vegetables to start with and paired it with La Fin Du Monde. Each veggie has its own taste and cooking method. It was easy and fun to share. Although we were trying to be healthy by ordering the vegetables, I have to wonder.  Next we ordered the Prosciutto E Arugula Pizza. It was eleven inches of heaven. The crisp and chewy  dough was fire oven cooked with mozzarella and sliced cherry tomato, than placed on top after cooking (I think) were handfuls of arugula and thin slices of fresh prosciutto. The waitress said this was her favorite pizza when she dropped it off, but I'm sure they are all good. I took my time eating because it was so good.   The buildings renovations must have taken time, taste and money. At one point during my conversation we just started to list things we liked about the decor. \"I like the big windows that let in all the natural light\" \"I like the detail on the paint job\" \"I like the floors\" \"I like that you can see the mosaic fire oven\" \"I like the shiny espresso machine\" Needless to say the new Market street location is worth a visit.",

    "text": "This has become one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh.  It's perfect for group outings, special occasions, or just grabbing a bite to eat late at night.  It has a casual, rustic feel to it with solid wood tables, subway tile behind the upstairs bar, and of course the beautiful wood burning oven.  The food is by far the star here.  The calamari is fresh, crispy and just delicious.  The wood-fired pizzas have that delicious sweet dough that is so well known and loved from the caramelization process created in the intense heat of the wood fired oven.  The toppings are exquisite.  Unfortunately, that did recently take their Burata pizza off the menu.  The Burata cheese would melt on the pizza creating a pseudo cheesy cream sauce that was out of this world.  I think I'm drooling...  Don't worry though!  The Burata pizza may be no more, but any of the others are also delicious!  The prosciutto makes the stuff you get at the average store look like shoe leather.  It's salty, tender and melts in your mouth.  Oh and the pizza is not the only star at this place.  The pasta is OMG good as well!  At my recent visit I had the gnocchi which were light, delicious pillows of goodness in your mouth.  Yep, I'm definitely drooling :-)  If you're looking for a tasty beverage to enjoy with your meal, have no fear!  They have all sorts of Italian imported beers, various beers on tap, and bottled craft beers.  Try the Anchorsteam beer, because what is better in this world than a good beer with an even better pizza?  The service is also something to tout about at this place.  During my most recent visits, Brian was our server and did an outstanding job.  Have a question about a cheese, an Italian meat, or a beer?  He knows the answer and will help you find something you'll enjoy.  His expertise definitely made the hard decision of what to order much easier.  Overall, I will be here again and again!",

We made a reservation and were seated in an awesome table upstairs. Shortly after we were seated, our waiter, Brian, came to our table and asked if we had dined at Il Pizzaiolo before. We both said no. Brian gave a history of the restaurant, and told us how all of the food is imported weekly from Italy. He then gave us an in depth run down of the menu, going through each category of food and explaining every dish. He made awesome recommendations on food and wine. For the wine, we told him the kind that we usually drink, and he recommended a reasonably priced bottle that we both ended up loving.  For food, we started with the Insalata Caprese which was amazing. The cheese tasted so fresh it almost melted in your mouth. For my meal, I had the Margherita DOC pizza which was made in a woodfired oven and tasted authentic. My boyfriend had the Rigatoni Con Polpette which he loved- and i obviously had to try. It was arguably some of the best sauce I've had. And they spoiled him with 6 meatballs in the dish. Both of us were very happy with our meals.  The awesome atmosphere combined with amazing food, and outstanding service from our waiter Brian has definitely put Il Pizzaiolo on our list of favorite restaurants. We will definitely be back!  Oh and I forgot to mention, the food makes great leftovers! :)",

Way to pricey for a 4 cut pizza no matter how you cook it.   The rest of my party got pasta. Which was even more expensive than my pizza and the serving size wasn't even that large.   Additionally, I have a food allergy and couldn't eat any of the appetizers except the calamari. What does this tell you? They could make meatballs without the herb I'm allergic to? Well, this means that they aren't fresh. Could they be frozen? Maybe, but who actually knows.   Lastly, if they lowered the prices of their food, they would be much better off.",

    "text": "What a lovely spot for an al fresco lunch!  Il Pizzaiolo is as authentic Italian as I've had in Italy -- the menu reads like one I ordered from in Taormina, the pizza taste like those I've had in Rome... Il Pizzaiolo is impressive, and if you're a fan of Italian fare, you won't be disappointed in this spot.   My girl and I sat down for a celebratory lunch, popped a few glasses of prosecco and went to town on the amazing special of the day, Burratta. Sure, it was $20 but it was $20 so well spent -- happiness on a place, I tell ya. It was fresh, slightly firm, incredibly creamy and so deliciously cheesy I cannot even find the words to accurately describe it. The fact that it was paired with the freshest-of-the-season heirloom tomatoes and a drizzle of slightly tangy olive oil made me swoon.   I was impressed with the service, too. Our waiter was attentive and sweet, and totally got that we were in for a fun experience. He helped us choose a pizza and checked in regularly to see that we were happy and everything was to our liking. He was really excellent, along with everything else.   As I mentioned, we sat outside overlooking the square, so while I didn't spend much time in the actual restaurant, it was energetic, casually classy and very reminiscent of European eateries I've been to. It was bustling, pleasantly noisy and lively.   Definitely check Il Pizzaiolo out if you've a hankering for fresh pizza, great Italian food and a fun time. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Went a year earlier and returned this past week to give another try.  I think the pizza size has gotten smaller while the price remains ridiculously high at $16 for a Margherita pizza.  Way to small to share unless you fill up on appetizers or aren't very hungry.  Pasta dishes don't offer much better value, a la carte for $22.  Dessert more of the same, 3 scoops of gelato for $9.  I will say the quality of food is excellent as was the service.  But this isn't gourmet preparations or fine dining.  In no universe should a small Margherita be $16.  Also the soundtrack was terrible....trying to be the hippest place on the block playing some type old school punk rock music.  Sorry the Ramones don't make for good digestion or atmosphere in an Italian restaurant!  This place could be a lot better if they weren't concerned with trying to be hip or gauging the customer with outrageously high prices.  Go for the authentic pizza and the atmosphere of sitting right in Market square, but realize you will pay a ridiculous price for it.",

    "text": "I am very torn here-the food was a very solid 4 stars but the service was maybe 2 stars (more like 1.5) at best (and that is coming from someone who waited tables all through college so I am more than patient and understanding). The only thing really going in my server's favor from last night was that our party of 6 was going to the Cabaret (to see Girls Only-which I HIGHLY recommend by the way) and he did get us out of there by 7:15, just enough time to walk over before the show. Let me go into further detail......  Our party of 6 had 6:00pm reservations and we were seated promptly upon arrival in the upstairs area. Market Square offers a valet service for (I believe) $7. I'd highly suggest using it given the parking situation in the area. Our party of six was put at, what appeared to me, to be a table more suitable for 4 people and we were situated right by the stairs. We didn't even have enough room for the bottle of water to stay on the table once our meals arrived. My mom and I were the 4th and 5th people out of our party of 6 to arrive, and we were told my the other three women that they had been sitting there for at least 10 minutes without so much as a greeting from waitstaff. Our 6th person arrived approximately 10 minutes after my mother and I and only then did our server (I wish I could remember his name-all I remember is the distinctive tattoo on his neck and I'd prefer not to identify him in that manner) come over to ask if we wanted sparkling or still water. We had been looking at the menus for quite some time already (timeline described above) and clearly wanted to order an appetizer as well as wine. My mom's friend started speaking and what did the server do- he  interrupted her speaking and said, \"Hold on a minute and I will be right back.\" We were pretty floored. He didn't come back in a minute, however, it was a full 7 minutes later!!! And, nothing against smokers because I smoked at one point too, but he came back reeking of cigarettes to the point that it was pretty nasty-and I rarely say that since I used to have that habit myself. At that point he took our drink orders (coffee, 2 glasses of red, and 2 of white), and AGAIN, my mom's friend attempted to order an appetizer and he scurried off while she was speaking! He took at least another 7 minutes to bring over our drinks. Then we FINALLY got to hear the specials that evening. At this point, we were beyond ready to order to make our show, so with a couple of modifications due to the specials we ordered (family style and shared): the pizza special of the day which was a pancetta and fig pizza with a balsamic drizzle and zucchini flowers (we had this cut into 6 so each of us could have a slice. I could have eaten the entire thing myself, it was VERY good!), the Ricotta gnudi (the other special for Wednesday that came in a sage butter sauce. Besides the pizza, this was the next favorite item at our table.), the cavatelli rapini ( Sausage, Rapini, Garlic,White Wine, Pecorino, Olive Oil), the pollo limone (Chicken Breast, Lemon, White Wine, Parsley, Butter), the PARMIGIANA MELANZANE (Eggplant, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinara, Parmigiano, Basil), and the VITELLO PARMIGIANO (Veal Cutlet, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinara, Spaghetti, Parmigiano). The cavatelli was cooked perfectly al dente (per the server it was homemade pasta), the sausage was spicy yet not overpowering too. I only had a small piece of the pollo limone but the lemon butter sauce was quite juicy and flavorful. The eggplant parm tasted as if it was fresh out of the backyard garden! The sauce was perfectly seasoned with basil and the eggplant was plentiful. The veal parm was very tender and I enjoyed the sauce but was not impressed with the spaghetti pasta, which I do not believe was made on premises.   Our pizza came out very quickly as did our entrees. We cleaned every plate; as I said, the food was excellent last night. When he asked about checks he split it up 6 ways, even though we said there were two \"couples\" that could be put together and then two single women. He gave a check to my mom's friend's daughter who CLEARLY did not look an age where she would be paying her own tab. Then he took FOREVER to run the credit cards through-at least 10 minutes. When dining out, I expect service to be on par with the price tag, and this service was in no way worth the $180 price tag of the meal. Although we were all disappointed in the service we received, our meals were quite tasty. When we were leaving, we noticed other servers bringing bread to their tables-yet another thing our server failed to do, which would have been quite appreciated given the lengthy wait for him to take our orders. I would come back here for the food, however, if I received this server again, I would politely ask the host/hostess for a different section to sit in.",

Then had a very tasty Mista salad.   After reading other reviews, I knew it would be an 'on top of old smokey' meatball night.  I went with the old school rigatoni with marinara and meatballs.  The meatballs were as tender and good as others had said.  The portion was generous and pasta cooked to perfection...with just the right snap when I bit down.  No mush mounds being served here.   My 21 year old son was just as impressed.  He had the margarita pizza with meatball.  I sampled a piece after seeing the big pizza oven and reading the rave reviews.  The crust was especially good.  Crisp with a hint of sweetness.    The service  was also excellent.  Our server, Casey, (a Cameron Diaz look-a-like) checked on us throughout our meal.",

    "text": "We couldn't decide where to go on Friday night at 9pm before going out for some drinks, and Il Piz came highly, HIGHLY recommended by quite a few of my girlfriends.  They normally go to the Lebo location, which I've heard is \"even better\" than the downtown spot, but both Bobby and I thought our dinner and experience on Friday were excellent.  We were seated right away by a polite hostess in a two-top in the back corner.  Our waitress was Barbara and she was adorable...so friendly and honest when we asked her opinion of items on the menu.  It was buzzing for a Friday night with most seats at the bar filled as well as the downstairs dining room - a nice little crowd.  We started with the complimentary bread and olive oil, then ordered two mixed drinks and the mussels in spicy marinara sauce appetizer.  The mussels came out in a very generous portion and the sauce was absolutely amazing.   I was eating it by itself with a large spoon!!!  Our drinks were also basic, but well-made.    We tried the Funghi and the Diavola pizzas.  The Diavola was a little too spicy to my liking, but the Funghi was perfect.  It had the same tangy, flavorful sauce that I loved and the buffalo mozzarella was amazing.  We ended up having two pieces from each left to take home, so we really took home a full pizza.  There were a few different people that had cleared our table and brought out our food in addition to Barbara, and all of them were equally as friendly.  We happened to be sitting under the air vent and it was really chilly.  Hating the fact that I am, actually, a spitting image of my mother's daughter, I politely asked one of the servers to please turn down the air, if possible.  He had no problem accommodating my request and didn't make me feel like I was being an annoyance.  Overall, I have no complaints.  We had great food and great service.  It was around $70 before tip for two mixed drinks, two pizzas and an appetizer.  5 stars from this girl.",

    "text": "Being a HUGE fan of the Mt Lebo location, the BF and I opted to go here for our anniversary dinner before going to the Benedum to see Elf the Musical.  Reservations were made, but ugh... I felt like we got the worst seat in the house.  Smack dab in the middle of the floor, constantly bumped by passers by and anytime the front door opened, I experienced a huge chill.  Needless to say, I dined with my winter coat on.  Brrrr...  Our waitress seemed nice but proved to be clueless... very unlike the Mt Lebo location - their staff never disappoint!  She read the specials off her cheat sheet, but it was so loud in there we could barely hear her anyway.  I told her I was debating on the dinner special she described as a hearty seafood stew with muscles, clams, fish, in a tasty broth or CAVATELLI CON RAPINI which is a favorite of mine.  She paused and said she would go with the special because their fish is always fresh and being such a cold day, the stew would be lovely to warm up with.  SOLD!  ...Can I change my order please????  Overcooked flavorless fish that tasted like it was cooked separately from the stew itself.  Ick!  I am a HUGE seafood fan, but I couldn't eat this.  The broth wasn't bad, but it was NOT cooked with the seafood.  Plus this was anything but a hearty stew.  I actually was left HUNGRY!  This dish was exceptionally disappointing.  The BF felt bad and thought maybe some tiramisu would make me feel better.  After all, they're made in house and the Mt Lebo tiramisu is usually quite tasty.  Unfortunately this one was just dry... At this point, I just wanted to leave.  When our waitress finally came around after fratranizing in the back of the house (yes we saw it.... in fact, you can see all things in the back of the house from where we sat.  Not cool when you see the staff goofing off...) we left.    Thankfully the Benedum sold candied almonds.  Highlight of my evening.  Next time I want to go to Il Pizzaiolo, I'll go to the Mt Lebonon location.",

About half of the pasta menu is made with fresh pasta made in-house, which in my opinion is ALWAYS the better option. The cavatelli was among those. The noodles had a decent bite to them, and not mushy. The sausage was average, but not bad.  Overall we had a good meal and would come back again if in the area.

It was a Friday night, we had a reservation so we were promptly taken to our table, the service was great, and the food and wine were delicious.    We went with the Montepulciano D'Abruzzo... so good I tracked it down at a wine store in NY and will pick up a few (much more cost effective bottles) bottles when I am working in the Buffalo area.  We had apps and salads and I do not recall exactly which ones, so I am sorry that I am at a loss here.  I will say that my margherita pizza and my husband's gnocchi were two of the best things I have ever eaten.  He loved the tiramisu too (a close second to Groceria Italiana's I believe).    There is nothing that I dislike about this place.  I cannot wait to come back and this time, it is my turn to get the gnocchi (it was that good).    I recommend this spot for date night :)",

The zucchini appetizer used slabs instead of the usual thin french-fry style strips. It's spicy, excellent. My group also enjoyed the mussels.  The basic pasta pomodoro is great. Servings are generous.  I'd like to see a few red wines around the $30 level, the list starts around $40.  We've really liked the staff on our visits. Great people who know the business and care about what they do.",

    "text": "Dare I say this location is better than the Mt. Lebo one? Maybe I'll just leave it as it's both different but equal.   It's really weird walking in here for me because I was in the spot when it was a flower shop. I worked right next door at the Starbucks and was friendly with the staff. But the transformation is incredible! It's really beautiful inside and surprisingly fits a lot of people. Probably because they've also opened up the upstairs as well.   With dark wood and intimate lighting, it still gives off that old world charm, but has a modern twist with a fancy pants bar both upstairs and downstairs. With the absence of the Mt. Lebo patio, this spot has a more urban feel, which I also like.   The hubs and I split the Quattro Formaggi (Fresh mozzarella, fontina, asiago, gorgonzola, pecorino romano, extra virgin olive oil) and the Diavola (San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh spicy salami, calabrian chili pepper, pecorino romano, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oilmozzarella) pizza. Both were equally delicious, but I think I favored the Diavola more. I liked the red sauce and slight spiciness, but it wasn't overpowering, which was great for me. Although the Quattro was also fantastic and super cheesy. It was unlike any pizza I've had before, which is a good thing.  Be prepared to take a while to scan their extensive wine list. I usually recognize a handful of names, but here I only recognized Chianti. Thankfully our server helped us pick out a tasty wine (crap, I forgot it... it was red...).   Make sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekend, because they get packed! I'm so happy to have this joint in town now. Although it will be hard to avoid when I'm down there now. I just want to stuff all the pizzas in my mouth!",

While they weren't accepting any more reservations when I called, they encouraged us to come and sit at the bar but when we got there, we got a lovely table and a great waiter! We love Italian wines and he guided us to a great bottle at a (for restaurants) reasonable price. My salad was fresh and perfectly dressed, my gnocchi lovely pillows of potato heaven. My husband's marinara pizza was very good as well, with a perfect crust. The only small criticism - the bread served with olive oil was just meh. Our favorite restaurant at home uses the dough from their pizza to make a delicious dipping bread. To their credit, the olive oil was the best I've had in an American restaurant - fresh, green, just wonderful!   And so glad to see Market Square hopping! Go Pittsburgh!",

However the service was shocking... took 30 minutes to get a glass of wine, after my whole table got their drinks. I had to ask twice for it.... then we got our meals, there was no issues there. Come bill time and a 20% gratuity was added to each bill. We had 6 people at the table, 4 separate bills. So the total combined gratuity for the table was over $70... I asked to have that taken off so I could tip what I felt fair (considering the 30min wait for wine) and the other single bill wanted to tip cash... we all got chatting as we were leaving and the cash tipper GENUINELY forgot to leave the cash (she is also from another country that does not tip). We left the restaurant and the server chased us down the street and told her she didn't leave a cash tip. She had paid for the meal on her credit card. And told me I forgot to tip! I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT!!! He just didn't read the amounts on the bill. I tipped what I felt was fair.... so after chasing us down the street and telling my friend she forgot to leave cash, she handed over some cash and he had the balls to say \"oh well you don't have to do that, thanks!\"  UMMMMMM so if she doesn't have to do that, DONT CHASE US DOWN THE ROAD!!!!!!!  I would never recommend this place to anyone. Seems like there are so many other places to eat in the square.....",

It's nicely located for local workers to grab a bite or for tourist, like myself, who are discovering Market Square to get some great food and enjoy the view. Firstly, the interior is so adorable and definitely worth a look. The menu offers, not just pizza, but delicious salads, pastas, and great appetizers. The day I visited, they had a steak salad special which I got. My only complaint was that it wasn't cooked medium, it was more medium well than anything (which I despised). The service was great, and our waitress gave us a great run down of the menu and provided some clarification when we asked.   Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",

She let us taste three different wines based on what we told her that we liked, and the one we landed on was an easy to drink medium-bodied red. Perfect for any pasta dish or pizza.  Our meal started with a tomato and mozzarella caprese salad, served simply with basil, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. It was strange to have a caprese salad without vinegar, but the cheese had a tang to it and it was flavorful as is.  At the recommendation of our server, I ordered the shrimp pesto linguini with zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and banana peppers. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the buttery pesto sauce and zucchini made the dish out-of-this-world. It was a sizable dish, so I had the pleasure of having leftovers.  My husband ordered the fish of the day, which was red snapper. The fish came out whole, head to tail, stuffed with a lemon wedge and stems of fresh herbs. The fish was flaky and delicious, despite the occasional pin-bone. Served over potato wedges, asparagus, and red peppers.  We finished our meal with espresso and a dish of chocolate and hazelnut gelato. We poured our espresso over top of the gelato and it was such a yummy way to catch a caffeine buzz.  We vowed to come back soon to try the pizza.",

I ended up with a Moretti La Rossa in a bottle that I had never sampled before and loved it.   Arriving before 6pm, the place was mostly empty and I had no trouble snagging a downstairs table without a reservation.

I am in a professional dinner with colleagues and a random waiter starts stalking my table and finally drops off a note :: photo attached. Hitting on me!! Asking me out - circle YES OR NO. Why do you even have time - you're at work and I'm doing business!! I wasso so so embarrassed! Thanks Il Pizzaiolo!!!   Next, I decide to try lunch. HUGE mistake. The Il Pizzaiolo was empty. A few people at the bar. Multiple staff members. We were bumped between 3 different servers.   Ordered meatballs as an appetizer - our 2nd waiter/bartender drops them off stating they are the \"freshest, hottest meatballs in town!\" - a blatant lie. We didn't even eat one full meatball.   The food was OK, we did eat a little of our meals. EVEN BAD PIZZA IS GOOD.   While we were waiting for our bill, from our third waitress, we observed a group of il pizzaiolo employees (including our third waitress), criticizing the undergarment choices of a hostess. Apparently she wasn't permitted to wear the black bra straps with the open back, then she changed that and came back and they told her that her dress was see through...so she changed again. All observed while waiting for the check. Completely done eating....FINALLY, I see a moment of clarity as our waitress remembers us in the corner, the ONLY patrons in the whole Il Pizzaiolo  As I leave I ask for a manger - after I already paid my check and tipped my server - it took about 10 or so minutes to find him. He then informed me that my opinion was \"interesting\" as they \"do not ever receive complaints.\" After responding that this is highly unlikely and I'm just trying to give feedback to help - he promptly told me he doesn't need to listen to this type of stuff from \"people like you\" - black, female, not in my usual business clothes? What is a people like me?   Never ever ever going back.",

The salad was the only thing I wouldn't write home about.   The bread is a soft pillow of deliciousness.   I couldn't resist.   Both pizzas were flavorful, with crispy crusts and a great sauce.  Word to the wise though - they come uncut unless you specifically ask them to cut it.  We topped the whole thing off with some white wine (couldn't tell you what kind since I suck at Italian wines).     My only real complaint is that while there were open at lunchtime on a Sunday, they don't have a lunch menu.   Our bill for two people splitting the food listed above came to over $100 ($44 of which was wine).",

The waitress was so knowledgeable about all of the menu items and was so easy to talk to, which was awesome! We also had a great table on the second floor, overlooking the square. We started off with the Arancini balls and then split to large salads for 5 of us. The salads were pretty average, just greens and assorted veggies tossed in a vinaigrette with shredded Parmesan. He Arancini were good, but not great. I had the agnolotti which were stuffed with braised short ribs and served with a creamy mushroom sauce. Everything about the food was great, except that the noodles were too undercooked. Usually pasta is cooked al dente to have a chew, but some of the noodles were almost hard, but not all of them. Other than that, I enjoyed. My aunt had the penne vodka and the pasta was undercooked and floury, that I almost thought it was inedible. My mom had the gnocchi which were definitely the best and super light. It was also too expensive I believe. We had a bill of $250 for 5 people, and we only had pasta, and three of the five pastas were meatless. I think that's a little costly, but I didn't enjoy the meal but I didn't think it lived up to the hype.",

It was so greasy in fact that I was ill most of the day.  I then had a pizza with meatballs and it was pretty tasty.  Pretty on par with their other shop and I was pleased.

Lebanon years ago and remember loving it but for whatever reason I hadn't gone back until this weekend. I really don't know why and it most definitely won't be 5ish years before I go again. I got the Quattro Fromaggio pizza -or something like that. It was delicious. Both my fiance and his sister got a gnocchi dish with different sauces. The gnocchi melted in your mouth, it was so good. Our appetizer was absolutely delicious. I forget what it was called. It was a cheesy bread concoction, so good. I really don't think you could go wrong here with whatever you order. This place knows good Italian food.",

Might have been good if it was cooked correctly.  I couldn't even eat it.  My husband had a pizza, and it was pretty good.  Just stay away from the gnocchi.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to give Il Pizzaiolo a try before a show downtown. Upon arrival we were seated outside, let our server know about the show, and ordered drinks. The menu looked very appealing, but would be hard to decipher if you're not a foodie or Italian. There were several instances where I had to translate. We decided to order a pizza and ravioli. The pizza tasted fresh, with quality ingredients, but was fairly traditional otherwise. It was a little strange that they didn't cut the pizza, though. The ravioli was also good, but not overly inspiring. At this point, we began to have trouble finding our server. We had to flag her down as she was about to go back inside after serving another table. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it did not disappoint. This was probably the highlight of our meal. We again had trouble finding our server afterwards to pay, though.  Overall, Il Pizzaiolo serves pretty decent food, but I'm not quite sure that it's worth going back for due to the prices compared to other italian places and the quality of service.",

The pizza here is really great--anything we have had (margherita, veggie, and something spicy I can't remember the name of) had been awesome.  Their appetizers are great as well--the calamari here is up there with the best I've ever had.  I wasn't \"wowed\" by the salads for the price, but they definitely weren't bad.  They have a decent draft beer selection and an extensive (Italian!!) wine list.  Most of the wines were unfamiliar to me, but the servers do a great job of helping you pick one if you let them know what you like.  The service here is pretty great in general, actually.   This place gets really busy, so don't come here for a quiet date night--but it's busy for a reason.  It's a great place!!",

The mussels smelt and tasted fishy, and pasta dry. Would not recommend this place. No after work specials and horrible food! Spent $75 on a dinner that I was completely unsatisfied. I would have rather gone to Nine on Nine and eat decent food. No wonder the outdoor seating was wide open in the gorgeous weather!  Total BUST!",

For starters the salumi is great - although they were out of the finocchiona which was a bummer but everything we tried was great.  Arancini was unfortunately okay at best - needed some sauce and just more flavor, I would definitely not order this again.  The pizza however was great - it would have been nice to see something a little more out of the ordinary like the potato & rosemary pizza I love at Pizza D.O.C. in Chicago or the awesome artichoke, creme fraiche, and preserved lemon pizza I had at Donatella in NYC recently but the combinations were solid and the flavor was great.  Crust was maybe a little thicker bread and less charred than most Neapolitan style pizzas but still all around tasty.  If you want some pasta or even a chicken dish everything appears to be homemade and will be very good.  Service on two visits was a bit on the amateur side but friendly and doing their best.  The wine list is nice, and the cocktail list was surprisingly good while the drinks were well made.  My colleague who hadn't eaten Neapolitan style pizzas before couldn't stop raving about how good they were.  I agree, and I'll continue to frequent Il Pizzaiolo when in Pittsburgh for work.",

That may sound odd...food that is equally comparable at a restaurant with multiple locations, but we've all had that disappointing experience where you think and hope the food tastes the same but doesn't.  Well I can assure you that it's equally as great as the food in the Mt. Lebo location.  My one issue was the service.  I realize they are new to the market square location so will give them time to work on improving the service aspect.  A work day lunch hour turned in to two...and while my co-workers and I were all for a relaxing lunch with some wiggle room on our hour lunch, the time it took for the food to come out after placing our order seemed excessive.  Especially since people that were seated and placed their order after us received their food before us.  Our group was only 3 people so not unusually large.  I ordered the margherita pizza which was fresh and cooked to perfection.  My co-workers ordered the sandwiches and said that they enjoyed them.  I'll definitely be back again with the hopes that service has improved.",

I didn't care for the drink menu but the vodka mint mule was very good.  Too many families were here so it's not exclusive. Then a baby carrier came in. It's a tiny place and having kids around makes the evening feel cheap and adds extra noise and chaos  Our server Rachel was awful. She never checked on our food after it arrived, never came to offer another drink and we had to ask for the check while she brought the wrong one and made us wait by taking another tables order in the meantime.  She was sloppy looking.  The blonde hostess was professional looking though.  Servers should cover up arm tattoos and have hair neatly contained. We won't be back",

It's a small and charming restaurant that boasts a viewable woodfire grill. There is also an upstairs bars, which I haven't yet checked out.   The servers are professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant. They're prompt and accommodating of all their patrons.   I strongly recommend this restaurant for a late lunch, quick meal, or a casual dinner.

For dessert, I got the espresso torte. The cake was cold which for this kind of dish, it should have been warm. This cake cold just was not appetizing and normally I eat all of the dessert, I left a lot of it. The ice cream on top was mercurio's gelato and that is fantastic as mercurio's gelato always is.        I would go back however I would pick wine and get dessert elsewhere.

It's the perfect size place and perfectly decorated to create an atmosphere that says it has fresh, real, delicious food. If that makes sense? The host was super polite and sweet and the employees interacted really well with each other (that rarely happens here I find in Pittsburgh). I saw the chef leave the kitchen to talk to guests, I love that.   But seriously....the food! I get so excited when I find a combination of good service and good food. We had the zucchini and I loved it, the gnocchi was absolutely incredible. It says it's made fresh and I believe them based on the perfect fluffiness. I exchanged Marinara sauce for vodka because that's me, but it was so perfect. Just what I needed.   If you're like me and you keep going back and forth on going here, do it because it's great.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurant's to dine outdoors in NYC , is called Isabella's -  in the calm but exciting streets of the upper west side. Dining outside at Pizzaiolo Primo (henceforth, PP..hehe - oh grow up), takes me back to these wonderful moments. Perhaps it's the location, the colors, the look - who knows, but this is important because   ambience is everything and PP hits it right on the mark (hehe).  Anyhow, 4 stars for ambience and relatively delicious food. I actually like this one better than the Mt. Lebanon location for two reasons.  Reason 1: Beautiful interior, wonderful upstairs bar, and a great outdoor dining spot in the heart of market square. Yeah the Mt. Lebo one has that little outdoor area and the very cozy wine bar, but but PP really has a unique city like vibe to it. I like it.  Reason 2: Montanara, nuff said. This pizza reminds me of something I once had in Naples. Kudos to the recipe artists for creating this fantastic masterpiece of a pie. The fried dough is cooked perfectly and actually was the first pizza I ate in Naples during an outdoor get together in film school. The Montanara was a perfect reflection of the texture, the taste, and overall sensory blast. In my opinion, this is the BEST gourmet pie in Pizza, and this is coming from a long time cult follower of Dom DeMarco. If you don't know who that is then sorry you don't know pizza. So just this pie alone has little blasted other pizzeria's out of the water in Pittsburgh for me. When I depart the 'Burgh, I will miss this culinary beaut.   The other pizzas are actually fantastic. The crust is perfectly charred, cheese melted to perfection and the sauces robust with that authentic homestyle taste and seasoning. I've tried all of them on the menu. The only one I wouldn't get is the one with the Pecorino - (think parmesan, but made with Ewe's milk) -  eh it just gave it this extra salt kick of a flavor that I wasn't a fan of.  Otherwise, you won't go wrong with any of the pie. My next go to would be the Bianca or the Margh DOC. To be honest my girlfriend and I stumbled upon this cute little place in NYC called Covina, and literally PP brings Covina style Naples influenced pizza to Pittsburgh.  Overall, the food is fresh, flavorful, and the vibe is one that is intimately festive in the heart of Market Square. Perfect for a date, great for groups or just a nice dinner in a beautifully set restaurant in an ideal location. Would've given it five stars but my pasta on a certain visit was overcooked and wasn't too big of a fan of the apps.  Overall, great place, my favorite pizza joint in Pittsburgh, and will always be a faithful consumer.  Oh yeah, and make reservations ...this place is poppin. If not, then the bar is just as fun.",

    "text": "Pizzaiolo Primo has a great italian menu. I would not call this the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh but it was really good. The ambiance was nice. Their pizzas are thin crust neapolitan style. A pizza will serve one person, and might not even fill you up completely if you have a hearty appetite. I got the cavatelli rapini, which was one of their house made pastas. Overall, it was delicious and was a good portion. The sausage in the dish was delicious and the rapini, which is usually a bit bitter, did not have a bitter taste at all (which I enjoyed). I would love to go back and try something else. The dress is upscale casual.",

From the Arancini to the pizza, caprese salad, dessert, and pasta, I can't even start to have a favorite. I recently had the Bianca pizza, which was flavorful and the cheese was fantastic.  The beverage selection is just as impressive. I would recommend asking what special beers they have on tap, as we recently had the chance to try a special brew that wasn't available anywhere else in the state, and it was good! And the wine... wonderful!  We closed out dinner with tiramisu, limoncello, and coffee - and we might as well have been in Rome.  Be sure to get a reservation, since this place is very popular - and be ready to try as many items as you can!",

However, yesterday I was denied service on the patio because it was \"just for one\". When I asked for a table, she checked the table setting, grabbed 2 menus and said \"how many\". I said... just me. Her answer was that their rules do not allow them to give a table in the patio if it is 'only one', but that I was free to sit at the bar!   Few things to say: 3 tables were free, it wasn't prime dinner/lunch time, I am a regular at this place (no coming back after this). I probably would have consumed the same as two people between apps, dinner, drinks and the delicious tiramisu!   I told her it was rude and that unacceptable, she just repeated \"not my rules\".... I walked away disappointed as I was not expecting this horrible treatment. How bad would it look a pretty girl sitting by herself enjoying a sunny day with a glass of wine and pizza! Instead, she opted to keep the tables empty...   Again - food is great, just don't go alone unless you sit at the bar... (sigh!)",

The good thing is that you can always find something to do in Market Square while you wait on a table. We waited for our table at Revel which is right around the corner and a great spot to grab a drink and chat it up.   When our table was ready, they contacted us by cell and we trekked over. Upon being seated, I noticed how small the dining room was which I loved. It was dimly lit, intimate and had all the makings for a great night out.   Everything on the menu sounded very good. I settled on the Parmigiana Melanzane which had yummy eggplant layered with cheese and a very flavorful and simple tomato sauce.  I loved how every bite melted in my mouth but the eggplant had some give and wasn't reduced to mush. I didn't choose a salad with my meal and I'm glad because the portion sizes here are more than substantial.   I am so glad we waited and looking forward to visiting this place again to sample more of their dishes.",

    "text": "I really love Il Pizz.  The food is consistently great, the wine selection is fantastic and the atmosphere can't be beat for an Italian restaurant in the downtown Pittsburgh area.  The Pizza: Let me preface with, I've been to Italy many times and my mother lived there for years, so I'd like to say I \"know\" pizza.  I've had many variations of the pizza here and all have been solid with quality ingredients.  To be honest, the pizza is just better at Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville.  Entrees: Ok so, this is MY PLACE for simple spaghetti and meatballs.  This comfort food is my jam and is my go to.  The sauce here is delicious and borderline drinkable.  Meatballs are just right, portion is perfect and the noodles could not get more perfectly al dente.  Friends of mine have also raved about the gnocchi or the cavatelli.  Atmosphere: Love it.  I prefer the upstairs, it feels dark and cozy.  The bar is great, easy to grab a glass of wine (or 5), a great cheese plate and glass of wine.  The chairs for the tables are oddly not balanced right, so watch yourself when getting up or hanging your jacket... I've seen many chairs down.  So why 4 stars?  While I love this place to pieces, the service has been hit or miss, borderline I want to give them 2 stars for how bad it has been.  If you get the wrong bartender, they can be extremely snobby to the point that it is uncomfortable.  WTF?! Italian is supposed to be welcoming and warm, and they have some serious work to do in this department.  Lose the entitlement, make me feel like this is my home and I'll bounce you up to 5!",

    "text": "I have enjoyed Il Pizzaiolo for many lunches since it has opened in Market Square, but unfortunately they have now lost my business for any future meals.  I made a reservation via Open Table for our work holiday lunch several days in advance.  I then received a call from an Il Pizzaiolo employee 4 hours prior to our reservation telling me that they had no availability and that my reservation had been canceled due to over booking.  The employee took no ownership of the error and repeated over and over that it was an Open Table error.  This may as well be True and   I fully respect that mistakes happen however, I would have expected some level of good customer service on the part of the employee.  In my opinion, the restaurant should take ownership of the error with the customer and work out the problem with Open Table separately.  Not only did she not offer any other reservation times or some type of remuneration towards a future meal as a way to maintain my business but the employee was rude and disrespectful on the phone. I have had better customer service at a fast food restaurant. Unfortunately due to one employee's behavior, Il Pizzaiolo has now lost my future business.",

I am not impressed however, by the salads which are very over priced for a salad without protein.  The service at Il Pizzaiolo is horrible.  I came with a party of 8 people and asked to sit outside because there were two open tables.  They stated we could not sit outside because \"it was going to rain\" which it never did by the way.  I believe we were not allowed to sit outside because they did not have enough waitstaff.   Shouldn't the restaurant be prepared and staff their restaurant appropriately??  Lastly, our waitress upstairs seemed like she had no idea what she was doing.  We asked her to split the check prior to ordering and she said i'm not sure I will remember who ordered what.  Then it took her a good 45 minutes to bring our check at the end of the evening.  When we complained about the long wait another member of the wait staff gave us attitude.  I will not come back to Il Pizaiolo soley because of the poor service!",

    "text": "I've dined at Il Pizzaiolo numerous times; most recently on a Sunday evening with a couple visiting from New York city. We arrived at our reservation time of 8p and were seated downstairs in the back right corner. I find the seating arrangements upstairs are a bit more spacious, but they were in the process of closing the section down for the night - understandable. Service was a little shaky on this occasion. Our waiter was one I've had before and not someone that I would characterize as stellar, so we got exactly what I thought we'd get. For the restaurant being quiet, it took almost 5 minutes before he came to the table and then our drinks sat at the bar for a couple minutes while he disappeared. If my guest hadn't blocked me into the booth area, I would have hopped up and grabbed them! We ordered two appetizers, the calamari and a meat and cheese plate. Both were quite delicious - especially the calamari which we found to be nicely cooked - not greasy at all. To my surprise, the restaurant is no longer ordering bread from an outside bakery (boo). Instead, they are serving their own bread straight from the wood burning oven. Guess what? It's basically their pizza dough, in the shape of a mini pizza/pita with no toppings. It's odd and I really missed having real bakery bread with olive oil to dip. Now, I know there are a lot of people that believe bread shouldn't be expected, to which I'd respond...then take it away and don't serve anything at all. We also shared two pizzas, the funghi and diavola. Both were on par with what I've had from Il Piz before. It's close, but nothing like pizza when you're in Italy. I suggested to my guests that they order a slice of tiramisu for dessert - they did and were very happy with their choice. You honestly can't go wrong ordering it from Il Piz. It's a plentiful serving a pure deliciousness.",

    "text": "I had a very unpleasant dining experience here last Saturday. I reached out to the managers and proprietor privately and they could not be bothered to reply to my email so here it is for the public.    First let me say that I think that the food at Il Pizziaolo is outstanding. Everything is prepared perfectly. I enjoy the food so much that last night I decided to bring my mother there who is Cleveland Magazine's food Critic, Laura Taxel. The food was excellent as always but the service left much to be desired. When we arrived we were ushered to the overcrowded wine bar where the bartender was clearly overwhelmed. I had to give her my drink order three times and wait 20 minutes before we had a cocktail. When we were seated and ordered a bottle of wine we were told that the restaurant was out of wine glasses and we would have to wait for our bottle. We told the server, who did an excellent job under the circumstances,  that we would be happy to drink our wine out of table glasses but he never brought it out. Then when we got our appetizer which included a dip to be spread we were told that there was no bread. We were also offered olive oil for dipping but it was never brought out. We were almost done with the appetizer by the time the wine came out.  The most disappointing thing to me was that the manager never touched the table to apologize for running out of wine glasses and bread.   Furthermore this was the second time in a row that there were major service issues. The last time I dined there my wife and I ordered our appetizer, pizza, and entrees at the same time and all of the food was brought out at once.  We had to send the entrees back and the food was wasted.  This is one of  my wife and my favorite restaurants but to have two consecutive experiences with such poor service is very unfortunate. Thank you for your time.",

The staff is very knowledgable on the cuisine and its origin. Excellent service. The handmade pastas are incomparable to others in Western PA. Absolutely divine. I've tried most of them. My favorite pizza is the Margherita DOC which highlights the buffalo mozzarella flown in from Naples, Italy each week. The manager told us all about it. I also like the arugula pizza a lot too. This place never disappoints! The food is always fresh and the staff is prompt and informed.",

First when we walked in the place was empty and they took us upstairs with out asking if we would like to dine down stairs. Then they stuck us in a corner by the window with the other three tables that were occupied. Not sure why they did  not spread people out in there vrs cramming everyone into a small corner. Then the meatballs came out which were cold and my wife's fried cheese was not cooked well and the center was cold.  The waiter took forever to take our main food order and we he did come back we ordered two pizzas which we were both looking forward too.  The pizza cam out and the dough looked flat like it was old dough or had not risen enough.  The pie was soggy and not even close to what the place used to be. We each tried one slice and that was more than enough to tell me I will never be back. As we were leaving the staff seamed like they could care less about even being there and right before we walked out the manager was standing there and didn't even take the time to properly greet us as we left or even ask how everything was.  I could tell the manager in this place is the reason for the decline and the staffs lack of caring.  Whatever this place used to do before, you really need to go back to your old ways.",

During lunch, our waiter was very attentive with the water and the food for our party six arrived very quickly. Our party was able to get in and out for lunch, which was great for a sit-down restaurant.   I ordered the margherita pizza ($16) and it tasted perfect. The crust wasn't salty this time. I'm starting to think if my first experience here was a fluke. One thing to note is that it didn't appear they had a lunch menu with typical cheaper lunch prices, which was a bummer, as many dishes were still well over $25. Also, a quick tip: the right side of the pasta menu lists the items with their homemade pasta.   Overall, it was decent and I'd come back when I'm feeling a slightly fancier lunch.",

The second was made with sausage and rapini, also really good but not as great as the pappardelle.   SIDE NOTE: you can order any of the dry pasta dishes and replace the pasta with fresh made for no additional charge! Also, they have a spicy oil for the pasta that isn't on the menu, but is free if you ask for it. Worth a try.   Overall, really great place in market square.

I had the chance to dine with a dear friend from college last week while she was in town, and I will definitely be back for more!  We went on a Wednesday evening and while I had made a reservation, it may not have been necessary.  It wasn't empty, but there were still a few small tables that sat vacant during our meal.  The ambiance can't be beat and it'd be perfect for a cozy date night.  My friend and I hadn't seen each other since graduating college (8 years ago, eek!) so we had a LOT of catching up to do. Our waitress was understanding and gave us plenty of time to gab before asking for our dinner selections.  I appreciated that she was attentive while not being intrusive.   As for our food, so many of the pizzas caught my eye but I ended up settling on the Linguine Veneziana which was to die for.  Shrimp, zucchini, tomatoes, pesto... heavenly!!  The portion was generous and I took about half of it home in a doggie bag.  My friend ordered the gnocchi and enjoyed her meal as well.  Our food was served quickly and we were promptly offered refills of our wine.  Overall this was a wonderful dining experience and Pizzaiolo Primo will be at the top of my short list next time I need a place to go downtown.",

Thankfully their pizza dough is vegan friendly (just flour, yeast & water) and they had a special pizza of the day that they were able to omit the cheese on. Pizzas come out in no time and are loaded with toppings. Everyone in my party ate every last bite and we left completely satisfied, anxious to come back again soon.",

The first time we visited was for lunch and we split a pizza - Salsicce and Rapini and it was outstanding.  Wonderful, thin crust authentic pizza.  The second time we needed a light night snack and sat at the bar.   Il Pizzaiolo had no Cabernet (my red of choice) but the knowledgeable bartender offered me a few options and I picked one and was really happy -an Aglianico.  I would definitely order it again.  We split salumi - excellent stuff.  The kitchen was open late on a Saturday, the service was friendly and helpful, and while there were lots of customers, seating was available.  There is a wine bar upstairs, but we didn't have an opportunity to visit that part of the restaurant.",

    "text": "It was at Il Pizzaiolo that I interrupted my date's meal to break down what the best types of ethnic foods this world has to offer are. I hate that it's such a cliche for most people to default to shouting \"Italian!!!\" when they give their answer (which is usually based on one too many refills of the unlimited breadsticks at Olive Garden). But my experience here was a firm reminder to me that as hard as I may try to break the mold and appear cultured, Italian food reigns supreme. Thanks to Il Pizzaiolo for reminding me just how high the bar for amazing Italian food can be set. Delicious! I've always walked past this location while trotting around the Square, but was never really drawn into it before. Fortunately, it was suggested to me we give it a shot and I agreed expecting something no higher than typical. We were seated in a crowded lower level which didn't start things off great, but I'm not very picky with that (upstairs has much more room FYI). It was all uphill from there though. Forgive me for not remembering names, but since the menu is mostly in Italian my comprehension/memory is low.  - Appetizer: some kind of stretched mozzarella ball with other Caprese sides. It's a giant ball of cheese so light and easy to eat! Gone! Delicious!  - Main course: Some kind of bone-in chicken/sausage dish with potatoes and red peppers. HEAVENLY! The sauce this is cooked in explodes with flavor.  - Wine: very good drink selection and lots of wine to choose from. My choice from Puglia made the meal.  - Dessert: a nice after dinner espresso and a warmed Fratelli.  Conclusion: I hear they import all their food from Italy (Naples style) each Thursday for the freshest, best ingredients. It shows. Good all around. Avoid the crowded lower level (although the bar plays hilarious old silent movies for some dining entertainment down there) and beware the price tag on some of the menu items (can get steep!) and I'm sure this place will bring to remembrance why Italian food is your favorite as well. Ciao!",

I ordered the Margarita pizza and it was good. It came very very late and the waitress apologized as she said the Health Dept was there for an inspection (nothing wrong) and she had to wait for them to inspect the oven before they could make my pizza. No problem, I said. But when I got the bill it was $2 more than what I ordered! When I told the waitress she claimed I ordered something called the DOC. I said well that's a lie I don't even know what that is. So she took the $2 off the bill. I bet they do that to everyone! So they offer a pizza for $2 more? That is the same pizza?! The \"regular\" one I ordered isn't good enough? Watch your bill here.",

We ordered the meatball app, the Salsicce pizza and the chicken scarpariello. Everything was fine, but certainly nothing to rave over. Given all of the other restaurants we visited that week, we would say that Il Pizzaiolo was well above average. The only real downside was the extremely cramped seating arrangements and the high noise level which made normal conversation next to impossible. If Yelp would let me, I'd rate Il Pizzaiolo 3.5 stars - which is better than \"A-OK\".",

We had a table for 10 (after fighting with them to get 2 tables pushed together) and they were unable to split the checks more than 3 ways.  After we agreed that this was going to have to suffice, it took 35 minutes to get our check and it was wrong.  Once she finally got it right 20 minutes later, she told us that it was going to take a while because of how we are paying (which was via credit card).  She then proceeded to tell us it was OUR FAULT and took another 40 minutes to figure it out.   There were 3 other people in the entire restaurant, sitting at the bar talking to the other bartender, who was not helping our waitress.  There were 5 staff members that just stood there and watched as our waitress struggled.    I will never go here again and neither will the 10 people I went with last night.  The fact that it was a Tuesday night, with no one in the place and they couldn't get this right is embarrassing.  I will make it a point to tell everyone not to come here when they are in the area for a play, etc.  There are plenty of other restaurants in this area that will treat you better for the price.",

During college, we started a tradition that once a year we get together (four friends and each of our moms) to eat yummy food and catch up with each other.  Seeing as this was our fifth mother/daughter dinner and our past four years had all been wonderful choices, we wanted to make sure we kept up with the streak.  Fortunately, we were successful yet again!  We were seated upstairs, which had a very nice atmosphere!  The windows kept the room very light and the volume was low enough that we were able to talk to each other comfortably.  We had heard poor reviews about the service, but we did not have any problems.  Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.  He moved at a more relaxed pace, but because we were so busy catching up, the pace was perfect for us.  The food was pricey, but it was delicious! There were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try, but I decided to order the spinach ricotta gnocchi (the special pasta of the day for Wednesdays on their menu) and I loved it!  It was a decent portion, but I wanted more!  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal.  We were also all happy with our drinks!  I would definitely recommend to others in the mood for good Italian food.",

By the time we got our meals, three of which came out together and the fourth several minutes later, I has asked for fresh cracked black pepper. Waiter never brought that, which you black pepper lovers out there know how disappointing that would be. They sat us in at a table located right in the entry way that was more suited for two people as that fourth person would be sitting in the line of heavy foot traffic.   After this great disappointment, we won't be returning, at least not to this location. We are still on that quest to have authentic Italian buffalo mozzarella.

The calamari was among the best that I have ever had - it tasted fresh, crispy and just slightly spicy and its also a pretty large portion.  The Caesar salad was just ok, olives were a nice touch.  The complimentary bread that is brought out with oil and vinegar is probably best skipped.  It's just plain white, flavorless  bread and they're probably doing you a favor by not serving amazing bread that you'll just fill up on.  For my entree, I ordered the Pappardelle Funghi, which was amazing.  I also tried a bite of the meatballs, which were very tender and tasted as if they were stuffed with a delicious cheese.  They also have a wide variety of pizzas.  I thought the prices were fair.

We sat at the bar, ordering some of the specialty cocktails which were made perfectly, and the bartenders were exceptionally nice, also very talented. Of the food we ordered, everything was very good, but a couple of things REALLY stood out. The Bianca pizza - house made fresh mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, parmigiano, and prosciutto! It had recently won some awards out in Vegas and they were much deserved - OUT OF THIS WORLD. We also had the pizza feature for the day - chicken and artichoke, very good. The pizza is certified VPN (Neapolitan style) and it is simple, with delicious fresh ingredients - highly recommend. We also ordered the crabcakes, which were fresh, and FILLED with lump crab - great job on those.   One that really stood out for me was the Burrata insalata. The burrata was served with delicious tomatoes, fresh basil, and EVOO. The burrata itself, was melt-in-your-mouth good, and was one of my personal favorites. Simple, yet glorious.   Some of the dishes were hand delivered by the GM, Michael, and he seemed passionate and very knowledgeable of the menu/ingredients. I really like what they are doing here and we will definitely be back. The 5 of us left with huge smiles on our faces! Everything from the initial greeting, to the drop of the check, we were thoroughly impressed.",

I came in before 6 and ordered off the happy hour menu I found online. Based on the posted menu online, I understood happy hour was until 6 but only offered at the bar on Sunday. Today is Wednesday. Their grammar was bad. See photo.   It should have been obvious to the server that I was ordering off the happy hour menu based on my selections but no one said anything until the bill came. I politely told the server that I was not charged happy hour prices and he told me they were only offered at the bar. I let him know that's not what the website said and had I known that I would have either sat at the bar or ordered differently. He offered a half ass apology so I flagged down a manager and showed him the verbiage online. He didn't even apologize let alone offer to correct the bill. Unbelievable. I was planning on a $30ish bill but got a $60 bill!!!! To be fair, the server was excellent aside from this issue.  Food here is waaaaay over priced and seating is uncomfortable. Being that the manager obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction, I will not return. Sad. This could have been remedied with a simple compromise.",

I have had the pizza and the penne alla vodka.  For the pizzas I tried the margarita, with buffalo mozzarella and the prosciutto and arugula.  The buffalo provolone on my margarita pizza was great.  Both pizzas had a pretty good flavor, my issue with them was how chewy the crust was.  Except for at the very ends, the pizza was not at all crisp.  This caused the pizza to fall apart and just made things sloppy.  The penne alla vodka I previously had was ok, but the flavors just were not that impressive.  The noodles also did not seem fresh.",

The consistency seems to be lacking at each of my visits. Pizza had been undercooked as well as overcooked.  I'm sure it's overwhelming keeping up with orders, given the location. However, that's even more reason to be on the ball. If you're in a touristy, high-volume area then you need to keep up.  When they first opened a few years back they were on point. Not so much lately. Disappointing.",

We ordered drinks, the caprese salad, and two pizzas to share, being the margarita and the prosciutto arugula. The pizzas were delicious! In fact, I loved the prosciutto arugula so much that a attempted to remake it at home a few nights later. The caprese salad was \"ok\" but for the price, not really worth it, plus the tomatoes weren't totally ripe. They have a cute little outside patio where we were able to sit & our server was really friendly and informational. We will definitely be back! I want to try one of the pasta dishes next time.",

    "text": "Visiting here from California to see a Steelers game this weekend and we stumbled upon this gem. The service was exceptional and the food was out of this world.  Christina, the bar manager was so gracious in offering her suggestions on what to eat on Saturday night. For starters we ordered  MOZZARELLA FRITTI which was primo. We shared a small INSALATA MISTICANZA and it was fresh and flavorful. We then ordered the SPICY MEATBALL pizza to share and we really enjoyed the taste and it was cooked to perfection. Christina was so gracious she treated us with dessert, vanilla and strawberry gelato and a cannoli to share.  My husband and I enjoyed the food so much that we both agreed to come back for dinner on Sunday after the Steelers game.  I did make reservations for tonight because we did have to wait sometime on Saturday, but it was well worth the wait.  Tonight we ordered ARANCINI. Very tasty and similar to MOZZARELLA FRITTI but with a different twist. Loved it! We did order the same salad because we loved the taste of the home made dressing and all of the freshness.  Tonight we were treated to Christina's favorite pizza PROSCIUTTO E ARUGULA. Definitely a party in your mouth. Smooth and light. Perfect pizza!! Then for the main course suggested by Christina on Saturday night. POLLO SCARPARIELLO was ordered by my husband and I ordered the RIGATONI POLPETTE but I did substitute with spaghetti.  We went back to the hotel very satisfied and happy to have met Christina who treated us very well. Thank you for your kindness and hospitality.",

The area is right next to the tables, along with the brick oven. So cute!   We ordered appetizers and salad: burrata, caprese salad, Cesar salad, and Misticanza. The salads were pretty good. Huge portions. I make it a point to try burrata at any restaurant I go to. I love it and I like to compare restaurants and find the best burrata. Their burrata was just okay. It didn't have much flavor. It's really a caprese with burrata instead of regular sliced mozzarella. Nothing fascinating. I've had way better. My coworker added a little salt to her portion to add more umph.   We tried the magherita pizza. The wood fired pizza was pretty good. The dough was great, perfectly cooked. Their sauce was pretty good as well. We all liked it. One person got the chicken with broccoli. He said it was pretty good but just chicken with broccoli so nothing to go crazy about. My other coworker got the gnocchi. She said it was really good. They give you a very nice portion that of course, you can't finish. I tasted it and the gnocchi was cooked so well. Not tough or too doughy. It was really good. The sauce was good as well. I got the salmon. It was a very nice sized fillet. I liked the pesto crust, but would've preferred to have it on the salmon rather than the skin because the skin fell off. The salmon was seasoned well and the pesto was very good. It was a good combination. The veggies were cooked well. Very tender and a nice mix of asparagus, zucchini, red peppers, and onions. All of it was a nice mix of flavors.   The waitress was so nice and tried to keep on top of our needs.   I would definitely return when I go back to Pittsburgh. If you haven't been, give it a try.",

We always start with the vegetable antipasta and this time they ordered the calamari also.Both were perfect.Then they  ordered the D.O.C, the diablo and the lasagna.But even though I loved all those the main thing I wanted was their eggplant.You might not know it, but they have the best eggplant in the city ! I am kinda a fanatic about eggplant and order it everywhere we go.The only one that compares is this restaurant from Venice. Il Pizzaiolo is obviously a lot closer! As for the service: oustanding!

Caesar not creamy and they use the dried out crutons that are purchased from a big supplier.  The olives are good but at the end of the day your still paying $12 for romaine and a bit of dressing with Kalmata olives.  As far as the pizza goes, a bit too much sauce which makes it flabby so plan on eating with fork and knife or rolling it up towards the crust and eating as a roll to best enjoy.  Very, very little cheese present, making it not worthy of calling it a 'Pizza'.  Sorry Il Pizzaiolo, not meeting the cut here.  For $18, I expect some cheese at least and understand that it's the most expensive product on a pizza but stop skimping on the cheese since someone is paying $18 for a individual pizza! Service was warm and friendly, with the server Vanessa being warm and welcoming, explaining the specials very well and upselling through the entire experience.  You have a great server here, and I will come back to offer her a job in the operation I manage.   A side note - the Valet parking in the Market Square is not really worth the $7 it costs as it takes them a solid 10 minutes to grab your car while your freezing cold and they do not offer an option to call ahead to have it ready.  This is not reflected on the restaurant as they do not manage this operation, just a little warning if you intend to valet.  Might as well just self-park and it will cost you the same or a couple of $$ less.",

    "text": "I should start by saying that although I live in the South, I grew up in the Midwest, so the sticky-sweet honey-darling attentiveness of Southern waitresses is often more off-putting to me than charming.  Thankfully (?), our waitress had none of that.   We arrived for lunch just before 3pm, so it wasn't busy, and were given a nice table next to the patio doors. We did have with us a five-year-old, but he's a quiet one, and given that there were only three other diners in the whole place, and that we bought him an $18 pizza, I hardly think this should explain the attitude from the server. In fact, I'm not even sure she knew she was being rude, but after rolling her eyes at the little one's request for pepperoni (which they had anyway), responding to another of our party's request not to have whole leaves of basil on her pizza with, \"There are only two or three leaves on it anyway. You can pick them off,\" and responding to a request to see a coffee menu after dinner with, \"We don't have *coffee*; we have espresso.  And we don't have a coffee menu,\" (in Italy, it's all 'caffe', and the options had clearly been listed in one of the dinner menus she had taken away earlier), we decided to go somewhere else for dessert, to give her back her empty table that she so evidently coveted.   Lovely pizza, reminiscent of my time in Italy. Irritating service.",

To finish off we had a shoebox-sized piece of tiramisu. They also have a wide variety of craft beers from Italy. The service was awesome, it's in the heart of downtown. And, for the quality, a great value. Will be there again for sure.",

    "text": "Almost two years into this new establishment and I can detect no deviations in service or food quality. I write this update to gently nudge people to understand what the concept is at il Pizzaiolo. Ron Molinaro, who has been at the original location in Mt. Lebanon since 1996, had a concept to create a place that is as close to authentic Neapolitan food as possible and he does a very good job at it. When I read some criticisms from self described experts.....\"Cut the Pizza\"...or, \"I've had $150 bottles of wine.\".......or...\"crust is different, almost like Indian bread\"; or \"the pizza, where is the cheese\"...., \"the coke bottles are too small\"...\"I've been to Italy, and all over the world...\". The self absorbed McBurger eaters among us who could not find Italy on a map.  Absolute and total ignorance by folks who have such a tremendous knowledge deficit that frankly it would be better off for them to go suck down the high fructose corn syrup and caramel color coca cola and supermarket frozen pizza  that they've grown accustomed to.  FYI, they serve the same coke that is served in Italy. No high fructose corns syrup. Ron wants a place that is authentic, even down to the coke he serves. It is not cheap at this place so don't complain about prices or wine, or how the  pizza is made or presented or anything else. If you want cheap ingredients, lousy wine lists, pre-made pizza sauce in a can and service for the ignorant, there are many choices. The following is a 'kit' from and Italian website that will send folks everything they need to make a pizza in the style made at il Piizzaiolo:  ________________________________________________________________                                                                  Kit Pizza Ca Pummarola Ncoppa per preparare la migliore pizza a casa tua con i migliori prodotti del mondo. Composto da:  - 500 Gr. bocconcini di Bufala DOP - Gr. 50 di Basilico  - Kg. 1 San Marzano DOP - Kg. 25 Farina Caputo blu pizzeria - Num. 1 Pacchetella (Pomodorino del piennolo confezionato al naturale)  Il meglio dei Pizzaioli Napoletani ________________________________________________________________  The above costs about $50.00 american and remember that the flour will go much farther than the buffalo mozzarella and San Marzano tomatoes.Then again, one does not have the benefit of a $50,000 handmade wood burning oven to cook that pizza in 90-120 seconds. Of course, one could always buy a garden variety pizza oven from a second hand restaurant supply store. What's the difference, right? The point is that the ingredients are quite expensive. It would be much easier to use domestic flour, tomatoes, and cheese. But then, the purpose of the whole endeavor is defeated by cutting important items that would reduce quality, affect taste, and mute the overall experience. My point is that there should be some appreciation from the Pizza Hut crowd of what Ron Molinaro is  doing and offering to the public.   One thing about social media is that people just can't help pontificating and offering opinions that are without any basis of knowledge. Don't presume to criticize something you do not understand.",

I love how the upstairs was decorated and it was cozy, but still spacious. There was probably room for about 50-60 to be seated on that level. There was a bar area, but we sat at a table for 4 behind the bar. Our waiter was informative and helpful. He offered a sincere apology when we had to wait a few minutes longer than expected for our drinks. We ordered pizza and pasta and that was not a mistake- you must try both! The pasta was so fresh and flavorful and the pizza had a nice crispy crust. The one thing that stuck out to both of us during this meal was the manager involvement on the upper-level. He was re-filling drinks, taking plates, and did what he could to keep everything running smoothly, it seemed. I was going to give it 4 stars but the extra bump was for the manager's participation and team-player attitude. We will for sure return.",

Started with the mixed salad, Caesar salad and calamari that we all shared and then had pizza. The dough is incredible. Simple and perfect.

Not only was the aloof and ditzy server completely in attentive and disrespectful, but there was zero communication between her, the kitchen and the remaining staff regarding specials.   Oh, and if you want your pizza cut, good luck with that. The pizza arrives uncut with no explanation as to why, and more importantly no utensils, other than the dull knife and fork you get for your meal, to cut the pizza with. Is this ridiculous or is it just me??  The only reason we found out about the reason the pizza was not cut was because was asked. Solid. And to save you the trouble of asking, it's because it is a very special style of pizza that they refuse to cut because they do not want the sauce to soak into the crust during the 5 second walk from the oven to the table. They would rather you spend 10 minutes trying to cut it and ruin it yourself.   I could go on and on about how the drinks took forever, and it took asking three different waiters to check on them for one of them to finally realize they were never put in, but I think you get the picture.  My advice: Get the food to go and bring a pizza cutter with you.",

We are waiting because of your mistake and then you're saying we can't sit!. Ridiculous.  The girl at the bar was very curt and then was throwing a semi fit, could see through the windows.  I suppose it was we were sitting outside ON PREMISES.  The food is pretty good, but not the best.  Pizza was chewy, which was a little disappointing.  Mozzarella is fantastic.

    "text": "This was my first time at any Il P.   First the good... I thought the service was adequate for the cost. The beer and drink list somewhere between good and great. That's it for the good in my opinion.  None of the bread varieties were noteworthy in as much as I don't have anything to say about them at all. The pizza was almost identical to Stone at a higher price.  The menu was fair but not vast. The first time I asked for a substitution I was shot down like a 9th grader asking a senior to the prom. I don't blame the server, she's simply doing her job and honoring the orders of the kitchen. This wasn't an outrageous request at all. It was something they had, I just wanted more of it. Fine, I understand you need to manage your supply of food back there. However, this put me in the mindset that nothing on the menu can be changed at all, which is probably True, I ended up with a marked up Stone pizza and a fried zucchini plank or two (which were good by the way). I remember saying, if these planks don't come out with sauce I'm gonna lose it. They didn't- but some was provided promptly by request.  My wife had meatballs. Yes, meatballs. As in on a plate. You see, there is no dish that incorporates both pasta and meatballs, odd for an Italian restaurant if you ask me.  Bottom line, if you look at the menu and see something you really want it'll probably be good. If you want some control in what you're buying, don't bother- next time, I won't.",

The gnocchi was light and delicious with a fresh tomato sauce and topped with mozzarella. We finished with expresso for my husband and cappuccino for me followed by gelato and a cannoli. Both dessert were good. We will definitely be back. A bit pricy for pasta but realize due to the location the prices were a bit high.  We recommend you give it a try. Nice al fresco dining too!",

Explained the menu in great detail and was very informed of all the ingredients, transport of items and depths of the wines and cocktails. Bravo!  Atmosphere....4-5. Cozy, quaint. A little loud, but with the walls and flooring and amount of people tucked in here, that can happen.  Food 3-4....antipasti platter. Great selection, not enough. 4 olives? Really? And, 2 pieces of bread for 6 people. Shouldn't have to ask for more.  Pizza. I had the sausage and rapini. It was good. Crust is different...almost like an Indian bread. I liked. Rapini was fresh. Sausage was under flavor. Needed salt or parm within the pizza. I know the big deal from them now is that they are not cutting the pizza to maintain the integrity of the crust. Three words: CUT THE PIZZA. I don't want to shake the table cutting it and it didn't keep the crust crisp by not cutting it. Bottom was a bit soggy.  Friends had pasta, ravioli, prosciutto pizza and veal. All were good. Have to say meatballs were great. Not the best, but great. We did have an appetizer of fried mozzarella balls that was heavenly.  Tiramisu was okay.  Price....1-2. I'm just not in to paying 15+ for a glass of wine and 18-22 for a pizza for 1-2 (maybe 2 if you get apps). I've had a 150 dollar bottle of wine and I'm telling you it's not all that different from a $25 bottle. I understand that all this food is flown in by Italian pilots humming Vivaldi, but I've had some pretty great Italian cuisine that beats this place on price by far.    All in all...will I go back?

    "text": "Wow, I was really impressed with their pizza here.  Very good.  They do it in the Italian style where the pizza is not cut into pieces but where you eat it with a fork and knife.  Almost everything about this place is European style right down to serving glass bottles of Coke instead of a bottomless plastic cup (a plus if you ask me).  They also had pretty decent espresso that I had after lunch.  The place was not too crowded a lunch time and we were able to get back to the office in plenty of time.  I would definitely go back here the next time I am in town.",

So walking into Il Pizzaiolo all I could think was \"there is no way this is better.\" It was divine! I got pizza, of course! Just got the margherita pizza with prosciutto on top! Seriously what is better than prosciutto? Absolutely nothing, it would turn a vegan! I had gone with family so I had a few other things to try as well! Such as the calamari, umm delicious! I never had it before and I'm so happy I waited to try it. The pasta was equally as amazing. Let's just say my tastebuds were on a whirlwind of flavors!   The server was just fantastic. Everything you want in a server.. lol. He was prompt with things and checked on us constantly which made the experience here even better!   The prices were a bit higher, but hey money buys happiness. At least in this case it does! I would suggest going here!!!",

I had the margherita pizza, and I wasn't disappointed. The sauce was perfect, and they import their mozzarella from Naples. I can get on board with that!  My friend had the Quattro formagi pizza, and I could smell the delicious tangyness of the gorgonzola. Yum!   The pizzas are a bit on the pricey side, but the toppings are fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to going back so that I can try some of the salads and pastas.   So happy for more options in Market Square!",

    "text": "Market Square is a dining destination for the downtown diner and if your tummy's talking Italian, Pizzaiolo Primo should make the cut. Inspired by Mt. Lebanon's original Il Pizzaiolo, there are a veritable variety of wood-fired, Neapolitan pizza pies to choose from, all with their notable crust. The large number of homemade pasta selections are considerable, but the Linguine Veneziana stood out both for the amount + sheer size of the grilled shrimp. If you don't want to dive right in to the pizza and pasta, the Calamari and Arancini are some of the best in town. OK...we were 15 mins late to our dinner party, but it shouldn't take 15 mins for the waiter to come by and grab our drink order...and another 15 mins to take everyone's dinner order? C'moooon, maaaan. Outside of those delays, service was courteous. Tight quarters upstairs coupled with a busy weekend night led to some disarray, but that's par for the course, people. It's worth checking out, so use OpenTable to secure a reservation in advance. Keep calm and eat Italian!",

Appetizers very good (mozzarella ball was 5 stars!!), drinks ok. Bread was ok and served with infused olive oil that really needed some olive puree, balsamic, or other herbs on the side, but they were nowhere to be found.   Mains ok, but not for the price, even the pizza was 'meh.'  The pasta with mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops was way off with the spices for my taste (too spicy for a seafood pasta dish, and I love spicy food, but not for this).   We were very happy with walking in on a Friday and them being able to text us when a table was ready, but otherwise I'll keep going to other Italian restaurants no matter if they are cheaper or more expensive.",

    "text": "I work downtown, and as a result I'm always happy when new restaurants open. I was excited to try Il Pizzaiolo, which brings a classy storefront to Market Square.  Maybe this is the burgher in me talking, but it always seems like the people dining there look like they walked right off the set of Entourage. I'm intimidated by glamour!   I prefer to sit outside on their sidewalk patio, as the dining room can get very noisy. Service is variable.  The hostesses always seem stressed and while I don't mind waiting, our times have always been at least 15 minutes over the estimate.    I've seen a few reviews turn sour regarding the outdoor seating and where diners are permitted to eat/wait.  This is actually not their fault.  Police have been cracking down on panhandlers and crime in the area.  Consequently, one MUST sit in the dining area for the corresponding restaurant.   Now onto the food.    The wine list is extensive but only includes Italian selections.  Most of the servers are knowledgeable and can recommend pairings.   The appetizers are decent but are not worth the ~$10-$15 cost.    I've sampled both the pastas and the pizzas.  The pastas are underwhelming in terms of originality, taste, and size. Entrees come with bread and oil for dipping, but the bread is too salty for my enjoyment.  I will never understand why carb-loaded restaurants serve bread with their offerings.  It seems redundant.   Pizzas are the restaurant's specialty (at a place called Il Pizzaiolo? No way!).  The wood-fired pies are good, and vary from the standard Margherita  to the more loaded Santa Lucia.  But to be honest, all of these pizzas lack imagination. I understand that Pizzaiolo is going for more \"classic\" recipes but for the prices why not throw in some innovation?",

    "text": "My Italian boyfriend wanted to take his parents to get some pizza. They obviously know a thing or two about pizza, so he picked this place based on recommendations about the quality of the pizza.  We walked in on a Sunday night at 7:00 pm and got seated right away without a reservation. The weather was beautiful and we got a table on the patio. Great start to a meal!  Everybody else at the table got pizzas (Margherita, Funghi and Diavola). Prices are a little on the high side, $18 ish. Everybody liked the pizza, so, it was worth it.  I ordered mussels, unknowing how rude and unprofessional out waitress Barbara was going to be. One of the reasons I order mussels is because I love to dip the bread in the sauce. The menu doesn't mention per sei that there is bread included, but I have never had a bowl of mussels without bread. When the mussels arrive, I get no fork for the mussels or a bowl for the shells. No problem, I use my regular fork and the side plate we were given in the beginning.  When Barbara comes around, I ask for some bread. She tells me that someone dropped the wrong kind of bread (rolls) this morning and they don't have any. Ok, no problem. I ask if I can have one of those rolls or some plain pizza dough. Before even asking the kitchen she tells me that they prepare the dough in a special way and that I probably can not have any because they have to make sure they have enough for pizza. She comes back a minute later and she tells me that I can't have any. I kindly told her that she should have told me in the beginning they don't have any bread for the mussels and I would have ordered something else. She told me she doesn't take her mussels with bread, so she didn't think it was a big deal that they were out of bread. Then she said they will have bread tomorrow. I said, that's great, but I won't be here tomorrow, she looked me straight in the eye, said OK with an annoyance in her voice and walked away.  When she came around again, I asked for a bowl for my shells, her response was: \"They were supposed to give you one!\", well lady, you are my server, you are supposed to make sure I got one.   I was a server as well, and I know that when a restaurant is half way decent, they first off, tell you when something is not available, offer a substitute or a discount. None of these were offered by Barbara, instead we got an attitude. At the end we asked if we can get a discount because my dish was incomplete, she said she asked the manager which said no,  because it doesn't say on the menu it comes with bread. If it weren't for my boyfriends' parents there, I would have asked to talk to the manager, but I didn't want to cause a fuss. Also, it wasn't for the few dollars discount I was looking for, it was for the principle of such bad service and not letting customers know before they order that they were out of bread.   Btw - I got the mussels in spicy marinara, and they were good. Too bad I wasn't able to enjoy too much of the sauce, just some with the outer crust from my boyfriend's pizza.  So, if you run out of pizza dough do you not tell people you did and you bring the rest of the ingredients baked on a plate and tell them you didn't think it was important because you are on a carb free diet?  For the prices that you have on the menu, there is a minimum service level required, which was not delivered. I have to agree with other reviews that your service is bad. Your location will get you the tourists customers, but not repeat local customers if you don't train your wait staff.  Service and Professionalism: 0 stars Food: 4 stars Recommended: No",

    "text": "I will preface this review by saying that I grew up going to Il Pizzaiolo in Mt Lebanon which remains one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The food is hands down the best authentic Italian cuisine in Pittsburgh.  This newer downtown location, however, was a terrible experience this afternoon.  I took my colleagues here for a take out lunch this afternoon, and I was completely embarrassed by the treatment we received - my office and I will never be returning to this location.  1) Overall, the location appeared understaffed - the girl behind the counter appeared extremely stressed out and there was a bit of a wait.  As a result, we sat outside at a table to wait for the rest of our meal.  2) My colleague, who is a lifelong vegetarian, noticed that her vegetarian pasta dish had some small pieces of meat in the sauce (we took a taste and confirmed for her).  When presenting this to the cashier, rather than simply taking the dish, he said \"No, there is no meat in this dish.  Show me the meat, I don't believe it.\"  Embarrassingly, she actually had to walk him outside and we pulled out a chunk of meat from the pasta as evidence.  He begrudgingly took the dish back inside and we were forced to wait another 10 minutes outside while a new dish was prepared.    3) When the waiter finally returned with vegetarian pasta, he had the nerve to inform us that \"for future reference, those ordering take out cannot sit down at outside tables.\"  Where are we expected to wait???   Overall, this was an embarrassing experience for a professional lunch and we will never be returning.  The bad customer service overshadows the quality of the food - avoid at all costs for professional meals.",

I requested a table against the wall but were told they were all reserved. No one sat in them for at least 45 minutes.  We ordered the salad with the anchovy dressing.  It was ok but you couldn't taste any anchovy.  I could make a better salad at home in two minutes.  And, our table was too small to have a breadbasket.  We also split a pizza.  We were informed for at least three minutes by our server that  the restaurant no longer cuts pizzas because they get soggy in the middle but they bring us these wonderful pizza knives so that we can cut our own.  When the pizza came, we cut it in half and split it, then out the big plate under our individual plates because, again, there was not enough room on the table for all the plates.  The pizza was fine - actually delicious and not soggy.  The tomato sauce is incredible.  I don't know if I will go back, though.  This restaurant definitely cannot handle a crowd and they are a little rude. I am not  sure that the pizza is worth the substandard treatment by the hostesses and the servers.",

    "text": "My partner and I have walked past this restaurant many times along with myriad Christmas shoppers in Market Square. It's the sister restaurant to a Mount Lebanon location and we thought it would make a cozy New Year's Eve destination.  Il Pizzaiolo offers five different house-made pastas and the other pasta dishes they offer are from Pasta Faella, which the house claims as the best pasta in the world. Well, I don't know about all that but our pasta dishes were damn delicious.   For starters, we ordered arancini, which are ping pong ball-sized fried balls of rice, coated in breadcrumbs and lightly fried. Two were filled with creamy cheese and two were filled with salty pancetta. We've eaten arancini in Milan and these rivaled the originals, although they appeared a bit more carefully prepared here.The meal opened with a sliced round of warm, fragrant bread that had been baked in their 1000o brick oven just moments before. Just that is worth the price of admission.  My partner enjoyed Cavatelli con Rapini and I ordered Sedani alla Norma. The pasta was perfectly al dente (to be honest, mine was a smidge too al dente, but that was to my preference anyway--perhaps they have psychic chefs?). The house wine was a Nero d'Avola that was a nice compliment to the pastas although not earthshaking. The pasta dishes were expertly seasoned and generous in portion...neither of us could finish so we got to enjoy more for lunch the next day.  Our waitress, Sara was a wonderful part of our meal. She was pleasant and knowledgeable and checked on us just enough times. We sat on the first floor and were pleasantly surprised that (although it was New Years Eve) we had a table suitable for four all to ourselves. After an appetizer, soup, salad, two entrees, bread and a mezzolitro of house red, our bill (including tip) came to about $118. Every swallow was worth every dollar. We thank her and Il Pizzaiolo for a delicious welcome to 2014.  There is no doubt...we will be back. Perhaps next time to try one of those wonderful-smelling pizzas that our fellow diners couldn't stop shoveling in.",

This place isn't fast food by any stretch but for a fresh pizza, it is pretty quick. A local friend recommended it to us and the menu looked awesome. I love an authentic style pizza and anything with prosciutto makes me happy!  The pizza came out after a pretty quick wait and it looked awesome. The flavors were rich and wait for it, real! I am so sick of the canned sauces and the dried herbs used in most places. Even the \"fancier\" places are cutting corners. But this place was the real deal. Amazing tastes from the real ingredients. I was going to take some pizza home but that didn't last and I ate the whole thing. Oops  My only complaints was that the pizza could have been a little more evenly topped. I had a small issue with the distribution of the toppings. I'm not really complaining here, just trying to explain why I only gave 4 stars. A very easily fixed problem and it didn't take away from our experience. Still very good and I will be back for sure!",

I had a wonderful time!   First, we ordered wine. The wine list was insanely long and confusing, so we asked the waitress for her recommendation. She told us that there were three house wines, conveniently called the #1, #2, and #3. I believe they were Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. I shared two carafes of the Pinot Noir with a co-worker and thought it was very tasty.  The team shared two appetizers, Panzarotti and Fiori de Zucca. The Fiori de Zucca was fried zucchini slices that were good but not my favorite thing ever. I loved the Panzarotti. It kind of tasted like a fried risotto and mozzarella ball. So yummy. Even at the risk of potentially embarrassing myself for taking too much food, I snagged the last one. For my entree, I ordered the Ravioli alla Caprese. The entree was very simple but superbly executed.  I hope to come back to Il Pizzaiolo very soon!",

This proved to be a good move - we were seated right away.  I got a pizza that included cherry tomato sauce, anchovy, garlic, capers, olives and basil.  As soon as I took a bite, I realized how they could charge $15 for a personal sized pizza.  You can tell that each ingredient is top-of-the-line.  They don't mess around when it comes to quality.

I liked sitting upstairs, away from the door, but there's nothing better than sitting outside when the weather is beautiful.  Make your reservations way in advance, this restaurant books up quickly, especially during the weekends.  I particularly like the pizzas, but everything on the menu is delicious.  The wine list is also very good, I don't know that you will see a better Italian wine list in the city.  Our waitress was very attentive and made some excellent suggestions for us.  She also did not hesitate to bring us a taste of a particular wine before we made our choices.  We chose the Carpaccio di Polpo as an appetizer and it was unusual and satisfying (Octopus, lemon and olive oil).  I like the renovation of the building, there was a flower shop here at one time, and they did a marvelous job of transforming the place into a fine dining establishment.",

The bartender, Lee, immediately greeted me and gave me a place setting and menu. After chatting with him about rapini and what it was, I continued to look over the menu at their pizza. Upon ordering, I said I wanted the \"salsiccia\" pizza which is the one with tomato sauce, not the \"salsiccia e rapini\". I will credit this as my mistake considering he may have thought since we talked about it, he assumed that's what I wanted. If you don't know what rapini is, buyer beware. This little broccolini sibling belongs NOWHERE on a pizza. My goodness. It's SO bitter and leaves the pizza at a B-. Without the rapini, it might be a winner as a white pizza...which I'm not a huge fan of to begin with. The mozz and sausage were tasty and the crust was...mama mia, amazing. I'd go back here, but I'm disappointed I spent $27 on lunch that I didn't quite enjoy to the fullest. I recommend omitting the rapini on your pizza selections.",

    "text": "There's better Italian food out there! To start, Italians are famous for bread and pasta, this place had neither .  Bread tasted like it came off the super market shelf, not even olive oil could make it better.  My wife had the Gnocchi which were suppose to be home made.  Again the tasted like the came out of a bag or frozen,  definitely not fresh!  I had the Veal Parm.  Breading was soggy, soaked in oil and over done.  The Spaghetti was too Al Dente and overwhelmed with sauce, I couldn't even finish my meal which says a lot for me . Trust me, we have had better Italian food!",

Even the bartender looked like she was just old enough to drink. And poured wine with a jigger. I kid you not.  Pretty high prices, food wasn't great but wasn't terrible. Nothing really to say all too positive or negative. Yes, the gnocchi were almost perfectly done, but on the other hand my pasta was still chewy enough to almost qualify as gum.   The main issue is that there are so many great traditional real Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, I think this place is working 95% off of it's location downtown.   So, cannot recommend, but if you have some time and are stuck downtown, give their gnocchi a try and let me know what you think.",

Matthew was our server, he was excellent and so was the food ! I had the pappardelle with mushrooms and cream sauce, he had the linguine with seafood ! We loved everything and will be making the drive from greensburg to come again !",

I have food allergies and I was able to dine here in the past. (Granted, is has been awhile)  According to her, they have no gluten free options except for the salads.  WHAT?! Do restaurants not realize many people have food allergies and gluten is a main one. Nothing but salads, really? I  traveled recently to Italy and every restaurant I went to had something I could eat. Some even modified their entree for me.",

WAS PATHETIC... it was soggy, floppy, and no taste... (should be soft, flavorful, etc...)  this was my 2nd attempt to try at their downtown location, compared to Mt. Lebanon and same result....disappointment.   Pathetic and why have a brick oven if that's the final product.    Great selection however for a simple menu though.... veal, chicken, fish..... stick with those and the appetizers. :)",

The gnocchi tasted as it came from the supermarket isle.... Not good at all.... The pizza.... Where is the cheese ?!?!?!? The cokes.... They sell these tiny coke bottles... So we probably had 3 each.... And the dessert we saw the tiramisu it looked amazing!!! But our big mouths said we wanted to have some gelato and they told us they have gelato.... Gelato $9 for 3 scoops.... It Tasted as regular frozen burn ice cream.... Not gelato....  I will not be coming back here.....",

The food isn't the worst, not the best either. I would come back but if this is the kind of service I get when I walk in the door I probably won't.",

First time here.  Small restaurant that was very noisy. No room upstairs. I had to sit at the bar. It was annoying that the servers kept bumping into me. Ice cubes were extra for my water.  Just kidding had to ask for them. Salad dressing was too heavy and ditto for the bread. Bar prices are very high.",

    "text": "If you remember your Italian grandmother lovingly hand making you pizza dough and noodles then you will be transferred back to her dining room at Il Pizzaiolo. We had the meatball appetizer, a personal pizza and a pasta. Everything was freshly homemade, well seasoned, and full flavored.  My wife and i went on a random Thursday afternoon, and it was still so busy, you couldn't get a table without a reservation.  We were promptly seated at the bar upstairs, and were immediately asked our drink order and given menus by a friendly and knowledgeable waitress.   I'm not usually a huge pizza fan, but I'd heard so many good things about the pizza here that I had to try it.  It completely lived up to the hype.  My wife got the pasta which was fluffy, homemade, and equally delicious.    All the food came out very quickly, hot from the oven.  They make every effort to help workers get back on time from their lunch break.  They also had an impressive fine liquor, wine, and beer list, including belgium classics Chimay and Hoegaarden on tap.  Whether you're going for the fast, excellent service, the drink selection, the pleasant atmosphere, or some of the best Italian food you'll find anywhere (including Venice), Il Pizzaiolo is a perfect choice.    It seems so wonderful for all occasions, it's tempting to head here for every meal, but there is one drawback.  Premium pizza has a punishing price.  Our lunch (1 personal pan pizza, 1 pasta, 1 shared appetizer, no drinks or dessert) was $50 with tip.  If you're willing to settle for more pedestrian fair, that's the price of 10 foot long subway italian sub lunches at the subway less than 100 feet away.  From that perspective it's not a great lunchtime value.  Il Pizzaiolo also does not offer happy hour specials (They're busy all the time, so there's no incentive for them to discount).    On the other hand, despite taking great pride in being cheap, I absolutely feel like we got our money's worth.  For a special occasion, Il Pizzaiolo offers a flawless italian dining experience, and while I didn't used to think a personal pizza could be worth $18, Il Pizzaiolo's really is that good.  I heard from a friend the eggplant parmigiano is even better and I'm already on the hunt for the next special occasion that justifies going back for secondi!",

The bar service/host could have been a little better but anything less than 5 stars would be an injustice to the chef.  Will def visit on my next trip through Pitt.",
