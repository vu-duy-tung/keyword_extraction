I hope they create an outside area for the summer similar to Baum. The sidewalk is quite large so it has possibilities.",

I wish I had the job of the person who bags the food and turns around to grab a bag of chips. That seems like such a bomb a$$ job. I had a lot of time to watch the lucky girl who was assigned that job today. Every time I come in the line is to the door. One would think it's because of the quality of the food, sadly that is not the reason. They're just always so slow, all of their employees. My love of chipotle food always wins over my hatred of waiting in the long, slow line that always comes with eating at this location. Full disclosure, I will be eating here again soon, once I block a portion of my day off.",

What kind of idiotic thing is that for customer service?! How could you not accept phone orders? This isn't grubhub or Uber where you only do things online from a smartphone. I am disgusted by the customer service at this location and the owner needs to do something about this! These lazy people don't want to work or help out a customer. They act like they don't care. When I asked if I could still call back to ask a question about an order status, the guy on the phone seriously said: \"You don't have to. It tells you online.\" It's implying that they don't want to be bothered. Please don't go here if you expect customer service and professionalism! Absolutely pathetic how they deal with customers and I am very disappointed.",

The ingredient ratios were terrible-- my burrito was basically all rice-- and I noticed customers before me letting the staff know that their burritos were not ideal. \"This is okay for me, but you can't wrap other peoples' burritos like this,\" said one. Leniency is deserved, the employees are all new, but there should be at least one person there with experience.",

My bowl is literally nothing but bean juice, a spoon of rice and of course to balance it I had it minimize the portions of everything else defeating the purpose. My mom ordered two bowls and requested a tortilla on the side of both of them. The manager barely heated them they are gummy and she threw them at the line worker as if she was irritated she had to do it. You could see her displeasure having to do work.

This place is constantly packed, which is really annoying if all you want to do is slide on in for a quick meal to eat in or take it to go. I know there's an option to call in ahead of time (I think), but I seem to forget to ever do that because I come here on a whim. While I do enjoy the food, I've been frustrated with the service. It seems there's always one, maybe two, people trying to help customers while other people are talking or doing something in the back. I understand there are other things that have to get done, but if it's so busy...maybe try to hustle versus texting? This is what I've witnessed and can't say it happens every single time.  After waiting in line a few times, I get up front to ask for a salad and have to keep asking for lettuce and some veggies as my to go order is being passed down the line. Same with the dressing for the salad. If I didn't keep asking, I'm pretty sure it would have been forgotten. I like the simplicity of the menu even though some people come up the line thinking they can ask for some weird concoction they don't even put together. Aside from my issues with slower service, I will say I've always encountered a pleasant employee. They're either smiling or say hello and I think that makes a huge difference. I understand they get slammed and a lot of the time they're trying to keep up with everything. I think once or twice I was able to get to Chipotle without a huge line and I felt like I just unlocked some sort of achievement in my life. Yes, it was that big of a deal.",

Chipotle burritos have carbs with non-irritating ingredients that fill me up, so I indulge.   I never have any trouble getting a little extra fajita veggies and sour cream. They make my burrito with a perfect balance, and they are always rolled to perfection. A burrito that isn't rolled properly puts me in a very cranky and frustrated mood, and these guys do such a great job.   The staff here is phenomenal, I am always attended to and I think that they move their lines pretty quickly. Chipotle will always be packed.

I ordered a salad here, and the chefs and staff are getting this business model from food prep to cooking all wrong.  Resulting in some huge insults to my taste buds. I ordered a salad here with carnitas last Friday. The server girl notices the lettuce in container is lacking she scoops a sparse handful, then yells for more lettuce. I think great she's putting more in, my salad bowl wasn't even bedded with lettuce, nope nothing.   I know I should've said something here but I'm way too tired to care so I don't, next comes a huge scoop of pork carnitas cool I'm down with that. Then my guacamole which actually  somehow more guacamole ends up in my bowl then lettuce. I don't figure this out till later.  The result once I blend my salad with fork is a ooey gooey non crispy mess. I take a bite....  Whoa chef were you salting the carnitas for a Mayflower voyage? Because all I tastE is salt city.   Ok someone's over salting the pork, as I move on I find someone's over salting the guacamole too and alas that's the main flavor of my dish.  Then ewww the texture... Is more soupy then salad. Just all wrong guys so wrong.  I want to come back here but if I do I'll be that annoying bossy person when I order because if these folks can't make a salad it's likely a burrito will short circuit some brainwaves.",

The Chipotle idea is great, make your burrito as healthy or unhealthy as you want. I had brown rice, beans, and veggies on a whole wheat wrap. I mean it was okay, nothing I couldn't do at home. and with a drink almost 9 bucks.

    "text": "I was excited to visit this location on its opening day! There are a decent amount of tables inside and a lot of bar seating as well. The interior was spotless and the staff was incredibly friendly.  I ordered my usual bowl to go, and everything appeared to be fresh and clean in the serving area as well. Portions seemed a little scant compared to the Baum Blvd location, but I certainly don't need a super-sized bowl, so I didn't mind.  For their first day, the staff seemed quick and efficient, and really welcoming as well. I look forward to walking quite often.   The only downside is the parking situation. This parking lot was a mess before Chipotle. Now it will be much worse. Park as close to Dinette as possible and away from the wine store, unless you park in the excess parking area near MCN Salon. People coming up the ramp from Whole Foods whip around so fast that it's almost impossible to see clearly when trying to back out of a spot near the wine store. Otherwise, love this Chipotle!",

When I go there at 11 when they're supposed to open and watch one of their workers eat a burrito, come out to smoke a cigarette and go back inside without any sign of opening by 1115 w an amassing line of customes, I guess I would have to disagree. Frustrating. Oh well, at least it reminded us that we'd be much happier down the road at mad Mex.",

But service is relatively quick and the quality has always been good. I do think the prices are on the high side considering your food doesn't come with a side or a drink.  I'm disappointed though as on my last trip I needed to change my daughter, went into the restroom to find there is no changing table inside. They have a kids' menu, they have highchairs, but no changing table? I don't get that.",

They were completely out of red onions and peppers (a new batch was on the grill but would've taken another 5 minutes wait). This seems to be a reoccurring problem at this location if you glance at the other reviews.   When eating my meal I did notice the food seemed greasier than usual for Chipotle. Maybe they used a heavy hand with the oil while cooking the food? I just thought this was something worth mentioning.",

I got soft tacos with brown rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, sofritas, guac, lettuce and a drizzle of sour cream. They put very little rice and beans on it, about 2 slivers of pepper, but drenched it in sofritas. Of course with my luck they were spicy and had no warning of such. The meal was good and filling. I don't come here often and I probably won't come back for a while. It's not the best taco/burrito place in Pittsburgh.",

This location in particular has to have the most miserable staff I have ever encountered at a fast food restaurant.   I've never actually been yelled at before By somebody who is making my food let alone the first two people on the assembly line.

It's pretty easy to use and almost everything  on Chipotles menu is on there (I didn't see corn though). The app gives you the option to pay for your food with a credit/debit card or pay when you pick up.   You can also choose the time you plan to pick up your food. When I arrived I had no issues walking up to the cash register and requesting my pre-ordered meal. Then again, there were not a lot of people in line to begin with but it was still crowded in the dining area.   Chipotle is one of my favorite places but I've never liked going to the Baum location due to the lack of parking and the traffic. I'm glad this new location is open and with the Chipotle app it makes ordering more convenient! Yay!",
