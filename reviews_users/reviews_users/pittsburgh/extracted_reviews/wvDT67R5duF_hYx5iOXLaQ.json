    "text": "Not feeling like contending with all the dahn-tahn Burgh traffic that inexplicably seems terrified of the tunnel monster, we decided to go to the Robinson location. What a brilliant choice that turned out to be. Breakfast was AMAZING! It was literally a ton of food and I ate all of it. Ok, almost all of it. I had the Steel City Breakfast of Champs with a waffle instead of pancakes. I just wanted to taste everything. As always though, my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I mean this thing had eggs, bacon, a giant, tender piece of ham steak, home fries, toast and a humungous waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. Everything was delicious, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic. Our server was awesome. My boyfriend had a 4 egg meat-o-rama omelette with home fries and toast. The huge smile on his face said it all. The place was super busy, and this was on a Friday afternoon. I can only imagine how busy it is on the weekend. So keep that in mind. However, it's well worth the wait. If you haven't been there yet, definitely check it aht!!!",

We ended up splitting the seafood omelet which was plenty for the two of us. To be honest the omelet was solid but nothing amazing.   I think if you're looking for a place to have a good breakfast this is as good as any. I think I might have to try some other items on the menu to bump up this original rating.. One more reason to head back to Pittsburgh.",

My two sons get their meals (pancakes) and my wife and I wait a few more minutes for ours.  Most of her meal comes (no bread which was needed for the eggs), and my pancakes were no where to be found.  The remainder of our food finally comes to our table.  Bottom line service was awful.

    "text": "Weeks ago, something deep in my subconscious told me to stop in this new DeLuca's restaurant to end an unfinished grudge while returning home from a doctor's appointment.   As icy gales of illwill  ripped across Western Pennsylvania, The Adversary contemplated his next, ultimate assault, conferring with MOAB, The Mutha of All Burritos while reflecting on past encounters at two Burgatory satellites and the original Strip District DeLuca's. . .  \"In this new Robinson locale, I shall crush Proletarian Steel forever more! What say you, burrito?\" The Adversary asked his hulking, simple-minded, single-minded champion.  \"MOAB izzz constipation. MOAB izzz indigestion. MOAB izzz heartburn. MOAB izzz doooooommmm!!!\" The creature of chorizo, eggs, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, avocado, cheddar, and homefries uttered, sounding like a trash compactor. A chile sauce of DeLuca's own making that was both saccharine and piquant bled a Satanic crimson all over MOAB's doughy, pale body as the Adversary cackled into the killing frost. Gazing into his magic mirror, The Adversary could see Kay and I en route to Pittsburgh from a doctor's visit in Chippewa.   \"They're coming,\" The Adversary, clad in a coal-black suit, tie, and fedora, mentioned to MOAB.   \"This Darren fellow, he barely lasted against the titanic tandem of Captain Drew's Seafood Omelet and the Funky Monkey Pancake stack. MOAB, you may be enough to finish him.\"  As Kay and I entered the 50's sci-fi themed diner, taking in the galactic, Atomic Age murals that adorned the interiors along with the silver and red motif of the furniture.   The Adversary appeared without warning amidst a cloud of inky smoke.   \"This shall be our final meeting, our last duel, a dance...to the death!!!\"  Kay was immediately subdued by hooded figures.   \"Your love shall watch you perish,\" the funereal man warned. \"Ah, the rings of Saturn...they are so appropriate. This will be my hour of cosmic evil! Attack, my minion!!!\"   MOAB charged. Howling and snorting like a gigantic prehistoric boar, it knocked me to the cruel floor. Patrons gasped, fleeing in panic!   Once I regathered my strength and wits, I both blinded and suffocated the behemoth with packets of sour cream, taming its heat. When it hunched over, I leapt upon MOAB's back with gleaming utensils and plunged them into the beast's body as a matador would a bull. Proteins, starches, vegetables, dairy products, and grains would fly about the eatery turned gladiatorial arena. Within 15 minutes, MOAB was gone, and I belched in victory.   \"What else ya got, Scratch?\" I asked.   Stammering, the Adverary replied. \"An insurance policy...\"  The Funky Monkey Sundae arose from a trap door.   \"Ha. Its big brother, the pancake stack, musta chickened out considering I pretty much whupped him.\" I said with a confident air.   Cursing, The Adversary, ordered the sundae to charge me with the point of a clawed finger. A carnal chimera of chocolate ice cream, bananas, whipped cream, peanut butter, and caramel slithered forward to meet its destiny. Ice cream headaches nothwithstanding, the glass dish would be emptied, and the salty, sugary, creamy dessert would be overcome.   Steam shooting from his nostrils, The Adversary telekinetically hurled planets at me with waves of his ghastly, skeletal hands. While I dodged the large constructs that had been thrown my way, Kay would use judo to toss both hooded henchmen into the Slim Onyx Count, ruining his concentration. An uppercut and a right cross would dispatch The Adversary's flunkies while a spinning backfist would put the magical mastermind onto his back.   \"This had not ended!!!\" the Adversary screamed in a rage with a nose bleeding tar.  \"I've got an insurance policy of my own,\" I told my fiendish foe.   \"No! NOOO!!!\"\"  From out of my back pocket I pulled a small seltzer bottle full of Sprite that had been blessed by a priest and sprayed its full contents directly onto The Adversary's accursed face.   Soon, there was nothing left of him but an empty hat. His pair of lackeys would simply melt into pools of infernal, tacky goo.   \"Whaddya think, Baby Doll?\" I asked Kay as I placed the fedora onto my bald head.  \"You rock that well, Sexyman. What a trophy!\" Kay answered.  \"Nah, YOU'RE my trophy, \" I said as I pulled Kay towards me and kissed her.   The gray skies gave way to sun. Birds chirped. The winds died. The air warmed. Customers cheered.  A choir sang.                                     THE END  P.S. The food and service were exemplary on all fronts. Don't be a palooka. Hit up DeLucas!",

    "text": "I enjoyed a late breakfast solo dolo today. Even though there are still 100+ things I could've tried, I decided on my usual.. the Steel City Breakfast of Champs. It comes with 2 eggs any style, bacon AND sausage, home fries, toast + two pancakes (can't believe you get so much food for about $10)   I'm personally happy about the new restaurant in Robinson. Besides downtown where I work and Oakland where I live, Robinson is where I spend alot of my time. Mostly bc Bobby works out there and I head out that way to get away from my usual work and home routine..   But anyways, this location accepts cards unlike the strip district location. breakfast is all day.  If you've never been to Delucas, the menu is so large! So many options from breakfast platters to omelets, French toast, pancakes, crepes and sundae style pancakes.. SO. MANY. OPTIONS for each category... And this is just breakfast.  My breakfast was delish. The only thing is I could've sworn at the strip district I had the choice of pancakes or French toast. I definitely ordered French toast last time and remember there being a decision lol. For the combos like mine, you can upgrade to fancy pancakes or fancy French toast for $1-$2 extra. If I must add, the home fries today were extremely well done. Alot of the home fries were burnt, extra hard pieces of potato that could've seriously chipped a tooth if you want a proper description. That's not going to stop me from coming though bc everything else was great :)",

Long story short while sitting at the counter for quick service, or so I thought,  the waitress who wasnt around was told by the cashier that I was waiting to order, mean while she just continued to joke around and laugh with the cook while I'm sitting there waiting to order. I finally got fed up waiting and just left. So I cannot comment on the food because I never got a chance to try it but I can comment that the service was terrible !!",

The menu is huge and busy, you might consider reading it online before you go,  and though their other food looked good, too, DeLuca's is famous for their breakfasts.  My girlfriend ate the short stack pancakes with a side of bacon, and left plenty for me to finish.  I had the Moab burrito.  My burrito was good, I asked for extra Spanish sauce, but the avocados were so far from ripe that the restaurant should have declined to serve them; they were like hard pieces of cardboard.  I told my server and the checkout girl, but neither seemed overly concerned about the food quality.  That was my only complaint though, and I would return to the restaurant, but next time I'll order pancakes and eggs.",

The hotel we stay at (Homewood Suites) recommended it and they offer a free shuttle to and from it.   The service is always welcoming and friendly. Our server, Nicole, was super sweet, personable and attentive.   Last year I had an amazing omelet that spanned the edges of the plate. This time I had an egg and cheese sandwich on Mancini's Italian bread (the BEST bread in the world!) with their crispy home fries. My sister had pancakes that were bigger than her hand. They were perfectly  fluffy and slightly crispy on the edges.   Best of all, the prices are very reasonable and all proceeds of any DeLuca's gift purchase (coffee mug, shirt, etc.) goes to non-profit animal rescues! (The menu includes a very important reminder to spay or neuter your pets : )",

My son and, I split the banana praline pancakes topped with ice cream and whip cream.  First of all the pancakes by themselves tasted like a doughnut or a cake.  Than you add the pralines and bananas along with some kind of rum, and you get a masterpiece.  The pancakes reminded a little bit of a banana foster.  We ordered a side of eggs and bacon and both were a cut above the rest, not your typical bacon and eggs.  My wife and mother and law ordered the seafood paradise crepe, and the seafood omelette.  Both came with a cheesy hollandaise that was absolutely delicious.  Both came with langostino's, shrimp, and lump crab meat.  Everyone absolutely loved their meal.

We went online to see if any food Network shows had been to the area. It just happens that Delucas had been featured on man VS food. We stopped in to check it out. It's a very family friendly place. The hostess and waitresses were older, which was very welcoming. The interior definitely has an older look to it which is refreshing. And the kitchen is open to watch.  But about the food, we ordered our sons cheeseburger sliders and their chicken fingers. Now these chicken fingers were HUGE. Full hand breaded cutlets and they were pretty tasty. My wife also ordered a chicken finger basket. But for me I still desired breakfast so I ordered the M.O.A.B. (Mother of all burritos) my goodness this thing was mammoth. Chorizo, eggs, potatoes, cheese and more cheese with banana peppers stuffed in a flour tortilla. I gotta say it was pretty good, I didn't finish it, and with good reason. This thing is huge. But the potatoes inside were amazing. The eggs were fluffy and my goodness the chorizo. If anyone is ever in the Pittsburgh area, please stop here. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Excellent food.  The French toast taste delicious and the chicken and waffles are pretty good too, not Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, Maggianos, or Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles but for Pittsburgh they are probably at or near the top.  The pancake was good as the bacon eggs and potatoes.  They give you a sausage patty the size of a burger but all in all it was good.  The presentation leaves much to be desired so I can't give it 5 stars but the food is fantastic!",

I will definitely be back and trying something different. I'll follow up on this review then.",

As a kid I can remember going to the strip and having breakfast at DeLucas, and getting the most amazing chocolate chip pancakes with a tower of whipped cream and it being the best thing ever! The chocolate chip cakes I had to say were pretty good, but not the same. Service was ok, nothing great. Our food came out super fast and the portions were HUGE. My son and I could have easily split the hot cake special I ordered. The food itself was fairly plain. I want a fan of the eggs or the sausage. The pancakes were good though. Everything was fairly priced in my opinion. Coffe, my breakfast and my sons breakfast with 2 substitutions was less then $20. The staff didn't seem like they really enjoyed their job very much. I understand diner mentality, and you wanna turn and burn tables quickly, but there were less then 10 tables and only 2 at the counter. A smile wouldn't hurt anyone. The one thing I was a little taken aback by was that when I was checking out, I used my checking card and when I was asked to enter a pin, I didn't want to, so I asked the girl checking me out which button to press so that I could sign for my purchase and she not only did she not know she was a little rude about whatever comes up is what you have to do. I will most likely not return for breakfast or any other meal at this location",

The space is tight, especially for a new-ish mom with purse, diaper bag and flailing toddler in tow. This was much easier to navigate back when it was just me. That being said, once you squeeze your way through the tables there are high chairs and the space is kid friendly (as are the servers, they loved chatting with my son!).  The menu appears to be the same as the strip location with sweet and savory offerings - so I went with my go to order, the mixed grill with sweet Italian sausage. Here's where one star gets knocked off my review - there were hardly any potatoes in the mixed grill, and the sausage is usually chopped up and mixed in...not this time. Just a lump sitting atop the pile of peppers.  Will I order it again? Absolutely. It's my favorite savory breakfast dish - but I'm really hoping they fix the potato to pepper ratio before then.   That being said, you can't go wrong with other traditional breakfast fare - especially the pancakes! If given the choice, I would pick the strip district location over this once...long lines and all. Even though they are slammed with business they have never disappointed.",

    "text": "So before visiting Pittsburgh, I asked friends from the area where I needed to go for food. And DeLuca's Diner on the Strip was recommended. Naturally since Sunday was nicer out than on Saturday, that area was not favorable for parking. So we saw that a second location was open about 20+minutes out. Sweet, so we made our was to this location under the thought that we'd have no problems. I wish I had a crystal ball, hell I would've settled for a magic 8 ball.   We go inside and there are two other couples waiting. Cool no problem. The wait was barely five minutes. Get seated in a booth. Great! Look over the menu. Order a Large orange juice. The server comes back we place our order. I order the California Benedict, and then the other order was the Omelette Special. Alright, Simple enough!  Then I start observing. The booth next to us, a party of five, seemed to get there orders, but not at the same time, and the timing between their orders being delivered was staggered at best. This seemed troubling, but I kept observing. At one point one of the bidders was sweeping near us and made some loud comment about how he \"needed to get paid.\" Um awkward. Oh look another plate came for the party of five, still three more to go. Needless to say it took awhile for them to get their orders. This continued to be unsettling. Then I overhear the booth behind me, their server apologized, and told them that she'd give them a discount for the inconvenient wait time. Wow, that's cool. The whole time we waited, we never once were visited by our server, given an update on the order. No offer of coffee. Almost 45min goes by and we get our food. 45 minutes, and it was close to closing time.   Food arrives. And presentation was .......lacking at best. My home fries looked different from those on the other plate. My overall plate just wasn't great. The omelette was burnt. Like making an omelette should be apart of Breakfast 101. Cooking multiple orders shouldn't be rocket science, contrary to the outer space mural on the wall.   When it came time to pay. We asked if we could leave the tip with the cashier. She said to just leave it on the table, well the table was already being bussed, and after the busser made that comment, we weren't exactly jumping to drop it on the table.   Maybe it's a locals favorite, maybe the original spot is better. But I wouldn't waste the time going here again if I'm back in Pittsburgh. Service is key, even if thevwait is horrendous.",

The dining furniture was worn, but clean. Very vintage.  The waitress was annoyed we didn't know what we wanted to eat within 2 minutes. She gave us coffee and warm cream, but never asked if we wanted a refill. Our food came our fast and the order was accurate. My eggs were very oily/buttery so I only ate one yolk (over easy), it was cold. My pancakes looked great, but were flavorless. It was the first time I thought \"did I just order lumpy, mushy flour for food?\". I ate most of the topping, but was underwhelmed. My friend enjoyed her meal, so I pretended that I had eaten earlier. The waitress didn't ask how my food was, so I didn't say anything.   Afterward, I grabbed something from Starbucks since I was still hungry.",

We got coffee, and I got the Swedish crepes and a side of corned beef hash.  The crepe was amazing - one of the best I've had.  The corned beef was fine.  I'm not sure how to explain it... it was small diced potatoes and corned beef, not the bigger german style potatoes and corned beef that I usually end up with.  It was not a dry hash.  I can't remember what my husband had, because I was too busy enjoying my own food.  We will be back when we have errands to run in Robinson in the morning hours.  It was overall worth the wait.",

Friendly service, short-order food (we had four of us, including two kids, out). They didn't charge extra for hot chocolate refills, and that's a winner in my book. I ate fried eggs, sausage, pancakes, and had coffee, and I loved it all - but diner food is sorta my thing. I love it as long as it ain't bad, and this was good.  There was a mistake on one of the ordered meals, and the server took the plate away (for good) saying she'd adjust the tab, but then she took off maybe $2 rather than the cost of the meal we didn't eat or take with us. I wasn't the one paying the bill, and this fact was confusing to the point at which I didn't understand that's what she did until it wasn't worth going back to address. (If you take someone's mostly-full plate without offering a replacement, you gotta take that whole order off the tab...).  Apart from that oddity and some wet silverware, the meal was priced reasonably and the food was good - I'd surely go back.",

We walked in and asked if we would be able to sit at the empty counter. Our server came over within a minute and we ordered coffee. The menu is quite extensive, so we asked for a few minutes to figure out what to order for our breakfasts. My husband got waffles, eggs and bacon. I opted for the banana prailenes & cream crepes with a side of scrambled eggs. It wasn't busy, so everything came out rather quickly.   My food was really tasty and worth the $9 for the crepe. I was only able to finish half of it. My husband's meal was big in comparison to other places, but he wasn't full and said it definitely wasn't his favorite breakfast.   The server was nice, but she wasn't very attentive once we got our food. Her and another server sat at the end of the counter and shot the breeze most of the time. I understand it was slow for them due to the cold weather, but I feel they should have been cleaning something or found something productive to do. That's IMO though....   Food was good overall, but it is really pricey, especially for breakfast. Give it a try if you want, but know there are other cheaper places if you're on a budget.",

Great Lobster Bisque and sandwiches. This place is good for Breakfast or Lunch.  Be prepared to wait, as this is a popular place on the weekends for Breakfast.  There are too many things that I have had and liked here to list them all, but you can't go wrong with an Omelette or Pancakes for Breakfast. They have some Pancake and Waffle dishes that are covered in Whipped Cream and Syrup, they might as well be deserts. Good lunch options are the Burgers or various sandwiches. I enjoy the Club myself with a bowl of the Bisque and a side of Onion Rings.  Something for everyone, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Two stars might be generous. We came to DeLucas to get some of the lobster bisque that I love. Alas- this is only a weekend option. Fine. My husband ordered a coffee, a sandwich, and a side of breakfast ham. He had to ask for the coffee 3x before it finally got there and the ham twice.  I ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings. Sandwich comes and it's dry and over cooked with four pieces of cold cheese plopped on top. The onion rings came about 5 minutes later and they were squishy and under cooked. SUPER disappointing, and the worst part is the server has this cocky, careless attitude the whole time. If you get this server, you will know what I'm talking about. I found myself becoming envious of another table that had a friendly and animated waitress. We were never asked how the food was by our server, the manager who was milling about, or the lady who took our payment. I decided that if I WAS asked, I would have been honest and posted a favorable review if it was addressed. It was not. You got it wrong, DeLucas. And while people wait for a LONG time for a table here- it wasn't even busy today. And they also seem to forget they have an open kitchen. So when we ask about the missing items and you say \"they're on their way\" but turn around and ask the staff to make them quickly, we hear you. Two stars because I'll probably be back for the bisque- but for takeout ONLY!",

This Deluca's is very convenient for those staying in the same area. It's located in a suburbanite strip mall.   The food portions were good. The prices were reasonable and breakfast tasted great. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. I, too, thoroughly enjoyed this local gem and will certainly be returning again.",

Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff and were seated immediately. We all had a hard time deciding what to order because their menu was so large. I ordered the breakfast burrito and per my usual requested that certain items be omitted. This was the only time in my life I will admit that I shouldn't have done that!  I was envious as I saw everyone else's burrito come out because mine was plain and boring. Overall, my party agreed the food was good but nothing to write home about. The portions are enormous though so prepare yourself. When we left, the line waiting for a table was quite long. DeLuca's was a good, quick breakfast but not somewhere I'd go regularly.",

DeLuca's Diner is located in a large shopping center. The inside is brightly painted with the solar system. There are plenty of booths, tables, and a small bar as well.  It is stereotypical of a diner.   Coffee:  The coffee was brewed hot and fresh, and the waitress refilled it often. In all, I have no complaints.  While the mugs given were not personalized, they have many options for sale.   I ended up purchasing a personalized coffee mug (which the proceeds go to a local animal shelter!).  How awesome is that?   Food:  There are plenty of options from all day breakfast and lunch. All day lunch isn't something you find everywhere! From the tables around me, everything looked delicious.   I decided to order a breakfast sandwich. It came with meat, cheese, and an egg, all on a homemade piece of bread. It was a great sandwich, and I have no complaints.   Service:  The waitress was friendly, and our food came out quickly. I couldn't have asked for better service.  Overall Thoughts/Summary: I enjoyed DeLuca's Diner, and if I'm in Pittsburgh again, I will be back.  The pancakes at a table nearby looked amazing, and I want to try those next.",

And the coffee is always good too! I have to say, the prices aren't bad for all of the food that you get either. We had quite a bit of stuff and our bill was around $40. I'm not saying it's as cheap as somewhere like Denny's, but the quality isn't comparable either. In all honesty, I do think they try really hard here to make sure the customer is always happy and taken care of. The customer service is pretty much unbeatable. Overall, great experience!

    "text": "More back-to-back reviews... but this is the dramatic conclusion to my Pittsburgh trip.   Before heading back to Virginia, we asked the front desk where would be a good restaurant to go for brunch (or lunch, didn't matter). At first the receptionist said First Watch, which we both knew well, considering there's a few locations in Northern Virginia, but when she suggested DeLuca's, only 5 minutes away from the hotel, it was fairly hard to pass up, especially since it is a Pittsburgh only establishment; a nice way to wrap up the weekend festivities.   When we pulled up to the restaurant, it was clear that this was a popular place, even on a Sunday. Throngs of people were coming and going, and we even had ourselves a 15 minute wait before anything got started. But once we got a table, things got interesting.  The menu has a plethora of everything you would expect for breakfast, brunch, and lunch (the joint closes at 3 pm). I was undecided between the pancakes, French toast, Eggs Benedict, and the Chicken and Waffles. My friend got pancakes and eggs. When it came to my order, I asked our server and she suggested the Chicken and Waffles (which is a PA staple). My meal also came with eggs, which I wanted over medium.  When the food arrived, it came in a lot of plates, and a lot of it on them. The pancakes were HUGE; my friend said they were fluffy and tasty. He liked his eggs. For my dish, the chicken was just okay, I was slightly disappointed, but the waffle was really good. Nice taste and a good complement to the chicken. My eggs were salty and buttery, and I felt it as soon as the meal ended. But I'm happy I got what I got. I can get French toast and pancakes anywhere. Chicken and Waffles are harder to find in Virginia (outside of the chain restaurants).   The bill was fairly reasonable too. Tell you what, overall, the cost for food in this area is really cheap and reasonable. I can see why people want to move here, the overall cost of living is just fantastic.   While the experience didn't blow me away (my friend like it), this meal concluded a Pittsburgh weekend I probably won't forget for a while.",

Covered in a hollandaise sauce...I don't know how they can afford to use so much expensive ingredients! A couple of slices of avocado tops it off! Wow! It comes with home fries and toast. A really big meal that I would even eat for dinner if they were open. Alas, they are only open for breakfast and lunch so wake up and get moving! This place is great!  Update: we came back today with a guest. We all loved the food! But the service was spot on! I can't even say enough About our waiter, Thomas. The ketchup lid was not on tightly. Without checking, one of us shook the bottle only to get ketchup everywhere! Thomas helped clean up and brought back a really nice shirt to change into! That was the kindness act that I have witnessed in a while! Now that is service above and beyond! I will come back often sure! Thanks Thomas!",

I remembered the name and place from an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and jumped at the chance to try some food because Guy Fieri knows his ISH!  SO its in a strip mall, weird i know. Its kind of hidden, not a huge sign to say Delucas but nevertheless we got there.  Its a diner True and True. Red bar stools, black and white checkered floors, all the retro diner decor. I loved it!  So my husband got the MOAB or \"Mother of all burritos\"...PACKED to the brim with onions, eggs, sausage, bacon chorizo breakfast potatoes, you name it. It was the size of his head im not even exaggerating. It was so flavorful. for $9?! SCORE!!!!  I got a chicken fingers basket because i was craving fries. I was kind of upset because they serve shoestring fries and i didnt get what i wanted out of it. The chicken fingers were hand breaded and you can definetly tell the difference. They arent frozen and are steaming hot and fresh!!  I give this place 3 stars because the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress was like 80, you could tell she didnt want to be bothered  let alone do her job. She moped around, got us our drinks took our order and never came back. The she just handed the receipt to us without even asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. Like shoo'ing us away.",

Although the employees were great about clearing off the tables, they certainly could have taken a broom to the floor; especially since at this point there were only several tables ever occupied while we were there.  Anyhow, I had an omelet with avocado & Asiago.  While the taste was good, I personally prefer a fluffy omelet, whereas theirs are overcooked a bit with a slight brown \"burn\" to it.  It makes it a bit dry.  Hubby had eggs, ham & pancakes.  He told me how good their ham is and he was right!  Absolutely delicious.  Of course I tried his pancake, too.  Nothing out out of the ordinary, but still good.  Prices are kind of high if you ask me.  Better rating if you would learn to keep the establishment alot cleaner.",

It took nearly 45 minutes before we were seen again to place our order. I had the MOAB. The burrito had nearly half of an uncooked onion in it. Along with an entire steamed tomato. The kitchen was not busy as they are in plain view so that isn't a reason for this poor culinary mistake. My wife ordered a sandwich and was given a wrap. All in all I am disappointed in my experience at delucas because people always speak so highly of it. I don't recommend going to this location. Stick to the strip district delucas.",

As soon as you walk in, the smell of non 100 year old establishment is refreshing and the place has a cozy friendly feel to it with very eye catching decor. You won't feel crowded. There's still wide open spaces. They have the BEST WAITRESS IN THE WORLD! Her name is Jamie and she's an absolute doll! All of our breakfast items were delicious! I ordered the pumpkin pancakes with a side of home fries and my hubby ordered the fried chicken and biscuits. EVERYTHING was yummy! The home fries were crispy. The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The pumpkin pancakes were so fluffy and moist and perfect texture. The bathrooms are in the same level. You don't have to walk down a flight of slimy old stairs to get to them. Alright, enough said. Just stop by and experience it for yourself.",

    "text": "Three of us went to Deluca's in Robinson for brunch on a Saturday. When we arrived, we were seated in a booth immediately. A waitress came over and said that our waitress was \"indisposed\" but would be with us soon. It took about 10-15 minutes for our waitress to appear and take our order. She returned several times to refill our drinks. We soon noticed tables of other customers getting their food, as we still had not gotten ours.  We waited patiently. Still our waitress came and refilled our cups without saying anything about our meals. After noticing a table of 7 guys who came 30 minutes after us, all getting huge plates of food, we asked. \"Where was our food? We had been waiting over an hour.\" She said she'd check. We watched her go to the counter, frantically go through her book of checks, obviously searching for our check. She seemed to have an argument with one of the cooks. Then she went to several other tables, speaking to customers, taking orders, etc... She finally returned to our table and explained that our order was lost. She said she didn't lose it, but it got lost somehow. She also said that they would \"comp\" our meal. I said we were planning to order dessert too, were they going to comp that as well? She said she'd ask. She came back and said they would not comp our desserts, but instead give us a $5 gift card but we were not allowed to use it on this day.  It still took about 20 minutes to get our meals. When they came, two of us ordered French fries. She explained that they were out of French fries. At this point, it was almost two hours since we ordered, and when we ordered, they were not out of French fries. So they gave us onion rings instead, not even what we wanted. After we ate, we got up and left. My husband left the waitress a $10 tip. I think she did not deserve any tip, as any good waitress should have noticed that after 15-20 minutes we should have had our food, and checked herself. She should not have waited for her customers to ask her where their food was after more than an hour passed. As we were crossing the parking lot, our waitress yelled out the door that we forgot our $5 gift card. We yelled back that we did not want it. We would never return there again--ever. No amount on any gift card could entice us to come back to a place like that with such awful service.If I could give this a negative rating, I would. A 1 is too generous.",

The menu called it Spanish style but it was more like watered down ketchup. Next time I'm definitely asking them to hold the sauce. Service was quick although I wouldn't necessarily call my waitress friendly. She was a bit snippy and seemed angry that we needed more time to look at the menu. We were there on a weekday morning and the place was fairly empty so I'm not sure why she was upset that we weren't ready to order the second we sat down. The woman who cashed us out when we went up to pay was nice and gave us a coupon for $1 off our next visit when I donated to the charity bucket at the register. Good food, adequate if slightly surly service, plenty of options for brunch? We'll be back someday. Not good enough to be worth fighting weekend crowds bit this might be our new weekday breakfast place.",

    "text": "After a bit of Christmas shopping we decided to stop here for a late lunch. A very nice hostess seated us in a comfortable booth. Having never visited DeLuca's for lunch, we ask the friendly waitress for some sandwich recommendations. We chose the first one she recommended--the Philly Steak & Cheese on a delicious Mancini's roll, with coleslaw and Cajun fries. We were NOT disappointed! The steak was delicious and perfectly cooked as we requested! Very tasty and filling!!! The coleslaw was fresh, cool, crisp--and delicious. The Cajun fries added extra zing to an already yummy meal. No complaints whatsoever! We were more than satisfied--and FULL!!! Considering it was near closing time, we weren't made to feel rushed at all. We are definitely looking forward to a return trip to this cool, friendly and clean diner in the near future!",

Cons: frozen strawberries, fake whipped cream, sub-par hash, and the absolute worst was the sausage. I'm 99% sure it was ground beef mixed with sausage at a respective 90:10 ratio. My friends and I will be sticking to Pamela's.",

Awesome service,  incredible food and huge portions round out my favorite new breakfast spot. Pancakes are massive and HOMEMADE (not a store bought mix, like most places). Bacon is nice and crispy and is great on your breakfast plate or your BLT! The huge menu can't be beat, so if you can't find something to fit your fancy here... check your pulse. Huge thumbs up!",

    "text": "This was my first visit. I've always heard amazing things about Deluca's, so we were excited to dine there. After my friend ordered a coffee, we noticed that they kept the dairy creamer on the table. In fact, they were on all the tables. Although this was unsanitary, I could honestly look past it if they're being changed often. Well, when he opened the container, we noticed mold on the inside of it. When my friend asked our server, Jess, for more cream, she took it, filled up the SAME container & brought it back. She clearly didn't pay attention to it.  Our server, Jess, was not personable and barely stuck around to see if we had everything we needed. They really weren't busy, this was post lunch rush. I ordered a breakfast meal... Jess brought our food and my pancakes were still going to take a minute, which is absolutely fine. However, I watched my pancakes come up in the window and sit there for 8-10 min while Jess sat at a table and talked to 2 men. She even went back to the window while the pancakes were sitting there and ran other food. She totally forgot about them. When she finally did bring them to the table, they were luke warm. Needless to say, I was very unsatisfied. The rest of the food was decent, though.  What Jess didn't realize is that she was waiting on 2 people in the food industry (my friend is a manager & I'm a server). I could have forgiven all of the mishaps if I felt like Jess honestly cared about our visit. No one is perfect & mistakes happen, but she showed no remorse and consideration for us. I will not be returning to this location.",

The entire 35 minutes we were there the 8 or so workers sat 1 table over from us and spent the entire time trashing another coworker and other customers. They were so loud we could hardly hold our own conversation. It was awkward. They were counting the money, mopping all around us and sweeping huge piles of mess by our table as we ate. Such an awful experience and with the food not being that good, I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Awesome food, great environment for a weekend breakfast diner. Service is good, with friendly people.  Every item on this menu is fantastic.  I love their breakfast burrito, they have a great Western omelette, chocolate chip pancakes are light and fluffy topped with powder sugar, some loose chocolate chips, and just the right amount of chocolate melted inside that theyre not too sweet, but syrup unnecessary.  They have great coffee, which for coffee snobs like me and my girlfriend, a good breakfast place has to have.  We have been down to the one in the Pittsburgh's Strip District which is the original, however with the seating a little small, and the line usually wrapping down the sidewalk on weekends, we decided to try the Robinson one which is located in the Robinson Town Centre in the Plaza across from the IKEA and next to the IKEA pickup center.  This location seems to be setup better seating wise, and with the added ability to check -in and then wait in your car or the benches they have out front, much more comfortable than the strip district location. If you're headed out to the Robinson Town Centre to do some shopping and find yourself looking for a place to have breakfast, forget IHOP or Eat'nPark check out DeLucas!",

We also ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo sausage. It was overcooked and almost inedible. We also got the chicken fried chicken, eggs, and biscuits which was the only saving grace to the meal. I believe our first time at Deluca's will be our last. There are too many other better choices in Robinson to waste money there again. What a disappointment.",

It became clear why the wait was so long. Nobody in there hustles at all. It takes at least 20 minutes to get anything you ask for - and we're not talking about food yet.  I got a bacon and cheese omelet. I was lucky. I actually got my food. When confronted with all the missing parts and pieces of my dining companions' orders, the waitress looked at each of them as if it was the first time she was hearing their requests.  The bacon in my omelet was not in pieces, but whole strips which wouldn't have been so bad had it been cooked. It came out of the omelet like the birth scene from alien - long, fatty, wiggly strips of greasy, rubbery, grey fat. Disgusting and inedible.  Breakfast took almost two hours in total and everybody was disappointed in their food. There are too many other good places to go. Won't waste our time (or money) again.",
