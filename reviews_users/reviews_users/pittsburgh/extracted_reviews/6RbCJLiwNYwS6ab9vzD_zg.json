That was the only bother with this order. We had their Falafel sandwich, Baba Ghannouj, Beef Shawarma sandwich, Stuffed grape-leaves, Muhammara; everything was delicious.   They also had Baklava to sample at the register and all I can say is that I've ever taste Baklava this fresh!  Not to mention the store itself; I haven't seen it in years and they have since fixed it up and added a Cafe. What a pleasing ambience!",

The regular gyro fell short of my expectations however, the lamb being mushy and slightly gritty. I plan on trying more items on their menu and possibly grab some groceries, but if you just want a good ol gyro, Sams Sun Sandwich in Carrick or Original Gyro on 88 are better options",

Hummus could have used more garlic but I like things garlicky. Grape leaves from refrigerator case we're dry and flavorless. Pita made fresh in store, soft and light. Baklava was best I've had since my auntie Haifa made for me as a kid. Just enough syrup to sweeten to perfection - phyllo remains crisp with no sogginess. Staff was super friendly.

Of course, I also scooped up a couple pieces of Baklava - their's is the best I've ever had. On top of the delicious food, the service is always so friendly. I also love perusing amongst the grocery items while I wait for my food. My only complaint, and it's really not that big of a deal, is that I wish they were open a little bit later.

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday with my father for lunch.  I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside, it was not what I had expected but in a good way.  The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.  For my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.  While we were ordering I noticed a rather clever tip jar sign that had something to do with \"pita\" spelled backwards.  After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While my chicken shwarma ended up being somewhat of a disappointment to me I think that this place has potential and I would like to give it another try.",

It smelled delicious and I could not  wait to come back for dinner. If you need any fresh produce or bread they have it all. We  finally went back for dinner this past week and I ordered the small size falafel wrap and my boyfriend got the dinner sized gyro (huge portions). The workers could not have been nicer and helped us with the menu items.  We also got hummus and pita (not on menu)-they gave us a full container of the roasted red pepper hummus with pita which was very delicious. My falafel wrap, even though the smaller order,  was huge and plenty for dinner.  Came filled with lots of fresh veggies including some pickled veggies. I asked for the tzatziki sauce which was yummy and I highly recommend.  Save room for dessert as they have many cookies and baklava. Forgot one of the best parts, the prices are very reasonable and they have a small seating area inside.",

This particular neighborhood is one I don't get to much, so since business brought me here I figured I'd come early and grab breakfast/lunch. Not many choices for breakfast along Brookline Blvd. made PitaLand the easy choice. Once I walked through the door I was shocked to see a stocked market, bakery, and industrial pita machine in the back! PitaLand has classic Mediterranean dishes including Falafel, gyro, shawarma, and lamb. It's so rare that I see shawarma, I had to order the chicken version. Well seasoned, just crispy enough, cool pickles, lettuce, onion, and dressing. Perfect amount of food, done well. I had to hold back ordering another. $8.56 with a soda is one heck of a deal for quality food like this. I will be back.",

    "text": "Way to go Brookline! This area is turning into a pretty good lunch destination, with some great ethnic food being represented. I have shopped at Pitaland for olives and sundries in the past, but today was the first time I had lunch at the cafe. Not only is this a great retail store to buy Middle Eastern items you might not be able to find elsewhere, the prepared food is delicious.   The menu features lots of Middle Eastern staples, such as falafel, hummus,  babghanouj and the other items that make up traditional mezze. A lamb burger and sandwiches made with their pita bread are also offered, as well as salads and platters. I had the falafel platter, which was wonderful. Their falafel is the best I've had anywhere, and I eat a lot of this stuff. The accompaniments on the plate were fresh and pickled vegetables with a side of tahini and their pita bread. All great. My husband offered to share his fries with me, as they give you a huge portion, and my hand kept sneaking over to his basket for more. These are perfectly fried shoe strings with a sprinkle of something like paprika...I'm not sure, but it was really nice. When I checked out with my olives and groceries, the guy behind the counter gave me a yummy fig on the house. He also sang as he rang up my order, and thanked me for coming in. The guy who took our order at the cafe also came over to ask us how everything was while we were eating. This would be de rigueur at a full service place, but was notable at a place with counter service. Really nice people and excellent food. I may have to give breakfast a try soon.",

Much to our own demise (wayyy too much to eat), we ordered a meat flat bread (thinking it would be small), a Gyro Doner (larger than normal), and a Lamb Burger.  The Lamb Burger, hands down, is one of the best burgers I've actually had in Pittsburgh.  Super juicy.  Cooked to order.  Feta cheese, pickled onions, etc.  I highly recommend.

It was very juicy, flavorful and topped with some feta cheese. My mom had the chicken shwarma which was marinated with 100% flavor. If you like your food bland and you're afraid of delicious and strong garlic taste in your food, stay away :) I had a bite and it was very tasty.

The beef was tough and it felt more like a gyro with tahini sauce instead of tzatziki sauce.  I enjoyed the falafel sandwich much more. The falafel is freshly fried and while not the best texture was very flavorful with a nice crunch. The pickles on it were actually pretty good even though I'm not a pickle fan... Definitely house made and not soggy. The other veggies as a lot of flavor, although the overall veggie to falafel ratio is a bit off. Still a very tasty sandwich, though.",

    "text": "I been here few times and tried different things. Food is okey. One of the guys that works there suggested the beef shawarma but it wasn't as I expected, the beef was chewy. Chicken shawarma was good, but you have to buy a side it doesn't come with fries or anything. Falafel are ok, a little dry. The lemonade that they make is 85% water you can barely taste the lemon. Some of the things like the feta spinach of meat pies I find a little pricey, $4 and it's as big as the palm of the hand. The place is fairly clean. I like the baklava and pastries there. I also tried the stuffed grape leaves which I liked. I absolutely love the bread here, always fresh.",

I don't know what to recommend more highly, their fluffy glorious gyros (which were the best I've ever had in a city of good gyros), their juicy feta lamb burger, their fresh baked pizza flat breads, their home made baba ganooj and hummus, their massive Mediterranean grocery supply, or their fresh baked pita's which you can watch coming off a conveyer belt carrying them fresh risen out of the oven!  Low prices, big portions, and delicious, perfectly prepared, home made fresh fare.  Go to Pita Land and treat your taste buds to a magical journey to Lebanon's finest!",

Seconds later I am invited in, given a hot pita, and practically a mini tour with invitation to bring my kids next time. This family business is amazing. This is a gem in this city.   The food is simply addicting. Fresh, flavorful, and all at very reasonable prices. We always get a bag or two of pitas, spinach feta pies, stuffed grape leaves, tabbouleh, cucumber yogurt, and more. One of our greatest discoveries is that you can get sliced gyro meat in their freezer case!   The cafe inside is probably one of the best kept secrets around. The falafel plate is a steal and they make our favorite falafel in Pittsburgh.   Trips to Pitaland are pretty much a weekly thing since that first visit. You will not be sorry for stopping in! What should you try? One of everything!  Editing to add that they have the best French fries!!",

Their meat, cheese, and spinach pies are always in my fridge in case I want a quick lunch. Their labneh is incredibly addicting.   Their cafe offers gyros, which are very good. They also have fattoush salad and it's my favorite thing on the menu. I get it with chicken.   The staff is mostly made up of middle eastern individuals, so they know what they're doing.

I ordered way more than I could eat.. and most dishes were pretty good. They have lots of vegetarian options. I'd recommend the Halloumi, the stuffed grape leaves and the Muhammara dip. I liked my falafal wrap, but I have to admit it wasn't the best I've eaten. The crispy cauliflower although flavorful was soggy and resting in a puddle of oil. The biggest disappointment though was the cold hard pita. I've heard SO much about this place and couldn't wait to try this apparently amazing and fresh pita that seems to be the USP of Pitaland, but it wasn't to be this time. I'll go back though one more time and try again. The service was ok. Don't miss the Arabic coffee when you're there.. oh and their dips are all pretty awesome!",

I'm new to Lebanese food, haven't had much exposure yet, but we tried and we loved! Had the Beef Shwarma, was delicious. My only regret is not ordering the full plate, will definitely be stopping here regularly.",

My dad had the chicken shawarma and the flavor on it was untouchable to any other restaurant that we have tried.   I can't wait to come back; and try everything on their menu!!!!",

This place is constantly busy, the employees are swarming about like worker bees.  They never seem to slow down for one second.  While I was browsing the shelves for what I needed I could tell the employees were watching me to see if I found what I needed.  Like a sixth sense and employee smoothly asked and pointed me in the right direction.  If it wasn't for that, the smells would keep me coming back over and over again.  It was a garlic heavy smell.  One that makes you feel warm and think about all the delicious food you have eaten in the past with the help of garlic.

The food was inexpensive and surpassed my expectations.   5 stars because nothing we had was less than awesome. The pita (10 pack for $2.50) was warm, soft, and chewy.

Y'all it's a Mecca (pun intended) and if you are a Pittsburgh local and a foodie, you absolutely owe it to yourself to come and check this magical store in person.  I think what surprised me most about the space was how efficient it was and also it was full of unexpected surprises. Behind that unassuming facade is an actual Pita bakery, a butchers, an industrial kitchen space and a grocery store. I was privileged to be given a look behind the scenes, thanks to the tour otherwise I reckon most folks walking in would only see the store + butchers and a glimpse of the fresh in-house Pita making, behind the glass windows.  There was tons of Middle Eastern grocery stuff, mostly focused on Lebanese brands as that where the owner is originally from but there was so much other grocery stuff on the shelves that I didn't recognize.   Also, the sheer variety of olives was amazing - There was one from Greek that actually tasted sweet!! We sampled lovely freshly made hummus and feta which tasted gorgeous- the only thing they didn't have was camel-milk chocolate, but who knows that might be coming soon.  Absolutely recommend coming here - it's a feast for the senses!!  Yelp Review 40/2017",

I will be back and can't wait to checkout their main location.",

    "text": "Absolutely phenomenal I love Pitaland I always have when I was a kid on the way home from school id buy a bag of small pitas for .99 cents and walks down The BLVD eating fresh plain pita. As I got older I started to indulge more into Lebanese and similar kinds of food. Pitaland's hummus is great along with the tabouli and olives and anything else you buy there. The best thing to ever happen to me is the installation of the cafe they added the food is to die for that you can't get just anywhere! Gyros and the Chicken Shawarma are my favorites if you have been to Pitaland you know how great it is and if you haven't been to Pitaland well your cheating yourself and missing out on a huge part of life. Pitaland is excellent all around from products to staff to cleanliness I can't say a bad thing about Pitaland it's a neighborhood staple and hope I never see it leave. So I hope if you haven't gone yet you go now because you will not be disappointed!",

I love the breakfast flatbreads and falafel for lunch.  In a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the Boulevard, Pitaland is a savior for us locals.  Support them with your business!",

    "text": "This is a real 5 star review from someone not affiliated with Pitaland. I've been going to this place since it was next door to Party Cake Shop and called Chahines. Good luck finding better pita bread or spinach pies. I live out of state now, but when I go home, I load up on the spinach pies. Seriously, it's worth a drive from across town. And the hummus which I am eating now is likely the best i've ever had.",

The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro, but next time will ask for a little more sauce. Pitaland is super clean, the employees are friendly and the food is the real deal. I plan on making it one of my regular stops.",

    "text": "They make their own Pita breads here, and they make them delicious and cheap. This would be enough reason to go here, as it's hard to find tasty and fresh pitas (most of the time, the bags still have steam in them because they're so fresh) for a good price, and this is it.  On top of that, they have frozen raw gyros meat and home made tzatsiki sauce, so you can throw together a gyros sandwich. They have hummus and different kinds of olives by the pound, and a huge selection of turkish and arab foods. Some of their more interesting specialty items do get pricier, but mostly the cost is reasonable, and you can at least understand why a little box of food bought in sub-bulk from a random country in the Middle East is more expensive.   Diverse, well stocked non-perishables and cheap, delicious pitas and prepared food accompaniments.",
