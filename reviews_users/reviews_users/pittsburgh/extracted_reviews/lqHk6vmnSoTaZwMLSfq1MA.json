    "text": "Like everyone else, I could NOT wait to try this restaurant.  I was able to snag a reservation for last Saturday and it was everything I expected and more.  We were lucky enough to get sat at one of the booths, which offered some nice privacy.  I planned on getting one of the amazing cocktails but I literally couldn't pass up a PBR 40.  I mean come on, it's served in a paper bag.  We ordered a little bit of everything.  The daily deviled eggs were something with pistachio and were so good I forgot they were even deviled eggs I was eating.  The pork sticks were probably my favorite part of the entire meal and will hopefully land a spot on the menu permanently.  We also tried the pulled pork, homemade hotdog and mac and cheese (I am bold enough to say possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever had, sorry Smoke).  And if that wasn't enough, we were offered a choice of a Leona's ice cream sandwich or Millie's ice cream for dessert.  Our waitress was fantastic and answered all of our questions.  Service was so good I almost forgot this place had only been opened a little over a week.  I can't wait to go back.  Bring friends and order as much as you can!",

We started with the deviled eggs which were the best part of the meal.  We ordered a pretty traditional BBQ platter with brisket, turkey, slaw and beans.  The brisket and the sides were good but the turkey did not have enough smoke flavor.  I lived in Texas for 10 years so my expectations were high for these smoked meats.  The BBQ sauces were tasty but a little thin.  We really liked the decor and stayed for a beer at the bar after dinner.  We enjoyed the creative cocktails and interesting beer list.  The shared sink between the men and women's restrooms is a fun idea.",

I was not sure why there would be a multitude of silverware thrown in a dirty coffee can on the table.  Not too appetizing- the silverware is meant to stay in the can for each party that sits at the table- who knows what could touch this silverware- disgusting.   The menu was pricey for the selection-  food was okay but selection was limited.  Sides were costly-  for the atmosphere the price was too high.  The kielbasa was tough (more than normal).   The alcohol selection was very good and the waiter was excellent but won't go back.  There are too many other restaurants with this price point that have a much better atmosphere and menu-  and please do something with keeping the utensils more sanitary.",

I sat at the bar, which is about half of the place, and had the \"Pork and Beans\". I is delivered on an oval plate with one giant slice of Texas toast. The server then makes a bit of a presentation while opening a sealed 16oz aluminum can of the home made Pork and Beans. The contents of this custom can of Pork and Beans is then strewn about on top of the Texas toast. It covers the plate in spectacular fashion and revealed an amazing soup of pork, 5 types of beans, spinach, multiple root vegetables (including parsnips) and a luscious sauce. I think they should figure out a way to sell this as a canned item to go. It's absolutely fabulous. They also make a \"moonshine\" which I did not try but is $9 for about 8oz. I think they should also sell this \"to go\" somehow. Great food, cool vibe and concept, and they hired he right people as they were all attentive (but in an awkward way), knowledgeable about the entire menu including the beer/bar, and were just groovy folks.

Again, didn't taste like BBQ. The sauces were even worse. Not BBQ sauce but closer to a Chinese sweet and sour sauce. I have no idea what is going on at this place and the reviewers as well.

Would you like to spend your time making a reservation for 2 at 6:30pm only to have to sit shoulder to shoulder with another couple? It was so awkward having the hostess take us to our \"table\" to find that it was between two couples sitting across from each other. Booth? No. it's a picnic table and the only way you get to sit is across from each other. The middle party also has to ask either of the other strangers at the table for silverware, napkins, and the selection of sauces. It really shows the greed and utter disconnect with the general public when you spend the time to call in ahead and get a seat literally (not figuratively) between 2 other couples who are forced to sit across a table. The waitress \"Deb or Debbie? Was amazing\" and the food was over priced but good for downtown, but really the seating arrangements and greed by the owners was disappointing. If you prefer to even have enough space to have a conversation I would definitely avoid this place. The seating is a disaster. Even with a reservation, they reward you by seating in the same place. Imagine a high school lunch table and literally having to sit shoulder to shoulder with a stranger. So awkward. The food and service were awesome though.",

The sauces will also fit any taste. The house is a standard BBQ, a hot that is spicy, but manageable, a mustard base (my favorite), and a seasonal. The seasonal rock, don't miss out. For sides, I've tried the collard greens and baked beans. Both thumbs up. As a big fan of Mac and cheese, I was disappointed. It was a tad bland for my taste. But, if you love smoked meat, go with the brisket and you won't be disappointed. I promise. Also, great beer list.   My only complaint is the seating. I am not a big fan of communal tables, but I suffer through them. What is really difficult to deal with is the bench seating. It is REALLY hard to gracefully mount the bench when you have to squeeze between people on both sides of you. Forget about it if you're in a skirt. Impossible. If they would replace the benches with actual chairs, it would get 5 stars.",

Just remember, if you max out on your sugar count, don't order two, because at $10 a pop your second melted froze will sit there in front of you and you'll be sad you wasted about $8 of it!   Anyway, the food here is what should really be the star, and it is! I've been here twice now. The first time I had the ribs and brisket. While the brisket was very tender and juicy, the ribs were fantastic. I would absolutely order them again. I also ordered the mac n' cheese, which I'm pretty sure is made with creamy velveeta, which I'm into. Come on, I grew up on that stuff!   The second time around I got the Kielbasa sandwich. Again, very good. I love kielbasa and it did not disappoint. It's a large sandwich with pulled pork, goat cheese and fried onion strings on top. It's a lot! Plus I ordered a side of greens and they were fantastic. Like I could eat a couple sides of those alone and still be a happy camper.   I'm not going to sit here and debate what authentic BBQ is, because I just know what tastes good, and this did! Fave sauce would have to be the original with the Carolina a close second.

When I came to Pittsburg several months ago a local recommended this place. I was not drawn in by the name and had no idea is had food such as pulled pork ( which is one of my favorite dishes), brisket and ribs and more. If I had realized that I would have been more interested in going. I really had a nice time at Pork and Beans. I had the Kim Chi pulled pork as I like to try new things. I have to say their Mac and cheese was stupendous ( a three cheese blend). We all enjoyed our meals. The other three guests with me got the family platter the portions that the waiter suggested were more than enough. My Moscow mule type drink was fabulous I loved the blend and the smoked taste. I am a bit of a bread snob My husband loves potato rolls not my thing at all I would have loved to see a bakery style bread option as well.       I really enjoyed trying all the different sauces too. I give them an A for atmosphere and interior design but a B+/A- for food. I think it would help if they had a non smoke house option on the menu to change it up a little bit.   Overall I liked this restaurant and had a great time.",

Then I had the crab fritters. They were a little dark and I thought they were going to taste burnt from being deep fried too long. However, these were pretty good but lacking on crab meat all the way. These deserve  3 1/2 stars.  Then I went with the smoked wings bbq flavored. Oh boy was this a mistake. I took one bite of a flat wing and there was no way to describe the flavor except that it tasted like feet and no, I don't know what feet actually taste like...So what did I do? I tried one bite of another one and that was the same thing. So the wings.....big zero stars !  The crowd was a mix of ages and styles so it was comfortable. Taking everything into account, I'll go back but I won't do the wings again.",

My boyfriend and I decided to stop in for lunch, and mind you this was on St. Patrick's Day. The service was still great, and the quality of food was even better.   For appetizer, I would highly suggest the crab fritters. Much to my pleasant surprise, they were much bigger than I thought they'd be and had a good amount of crab meat in them. A great seafood starter to a meat-heavy meal.  I ordered the pastrami BLT. It. was. a mouthful. Take your average BLT and multiply it by 10000. The bold flavors of the pastrami with the thick cut bacon, an amazing house mayo, and toasted bread soaking up all the yummy juices from the meats. My boyfriend ordered the brisket grilled cheese. Now imagine your average childhood grilled cheese, with mounds of pulled brisket on it, oozing with cheese wiz. But not so much cheese wiz to be overwhelming, but just enough to compete with the smoky brisket flavor. Both of our sandwiches came with seasoned house potato chips. And one of the best parts, was tasting the variety of bbq sauces provided in bottles at the table. My top pick ~ the classic.  If i have ever been to meat heaven, this would be it. Leave your calorie counters at the door!  Also, check out the cool sink in the bathroom!",

    "text": "We have been a great fan of Pork & Beans since it opened in Pittsburgh's Cultural District. It was a fabulous place to taste some great beer and enjoy a wonderful dinner. On our last venture there on 5/12/18, we were sorely disappointed in the \"new\" menu. The offerings had been paired down so much, that our favorites were not there. Gone were the deviled egg of the day, the Hot Brown, and numerous salads.   Then there was the service. The beer offerings also change frequently. When we asked our waiter about what dark beers he could recommend nothing. He had no idea about what was actually on the menu. We had to ask if we could do a taste test instead of he offering it. He checked back only once to see if we needed anything right after our meals were served. Then he disappeared from view until returning to ask if we wanted another beer. When we said no, he left and brought the check. No asking about dessert, which we usually enjoyed there because of the ice cream sandwiches.   I am not sure if the place is under new management or what, but I didn't see any of our favorite servers. The food was ok, portions a bit smaller and now served on school cafeteria trays instead of the metal ones from before. Also the checks are now just put on the table and not presented in Campbell Soup cans, which is really an insignificant thing, but one  that added to the ambience.   Will be looking for another favorite place to eat before shows and concerts.",

Smaller place but with an old meat packing/butcher shop vibe with a sharp bar in front.  Food is terrific.  I've waited in long lines for similar BBQ fare in other cities known more for BBQ.  This place is on par with those for sure and we had zero wait!  Smoked dry rubbed wings with coffee spice were awesome.  My friend's brisket was terrific.  He chose a leaner cut.  I ordered this really good pork belly BLT which I guess was newer on the menu.  The sides and sauces were freaking baller.  Mac & cheese, collard greens, jojo's were excellent.  Same with all of the different BBQ sauces.  Good beers on tap and a nice bar which is where we ate.  Highly recommend!",

The fritters were amazing. Fried to perfection perfect combo of sweet corn to jalopeno. I considered these more like hush puppies though. Deviled eggs were nothing too special. I ordered the pork belly with greens. The pork belly had the perfect ratio of meat and fat. Well worth it and liked how it was sliced and not cubed.  Like I said the service needs improved, hire more servers. The atmosphere was a take on country bbq, rustic and just like all the other resturants they own. Trust me we will be coming back. Hopefully get  those piggy ears this time.",

We then ordered the pig ears, jalapeno corn bread and the appetizer fries. All of these items were solid and I would order them again. I won't go through all of the food because all of it has good taste and it was enjoyable. Though, they could bring out more bread and pickles with your meals.  HOWEVER, the presentation and operations of the dining experience is a mess. They bring ALL of your food out on a giant cafeteria tray. This is a unfortunate for folks who want to eat their meals in a non sharing way. Secondly, the plates that they gave you to eat on are like a silver dollar! Food fell off of my plate and it was generally an uncomfortable dining experience. If you're going to force people to eat in a communal setting, then at least give them a proper way to eat it. If the presentation had been different, so would the rating and I bet I'm on the only one.",

Tried a half slab of ribs with a really good layer of seasoning, and the bones slid right out - very tender.  Even better was the pork belly pastrami - super tender, nice crispy herb layer, and perfectly salty.  Ended with a nice ice cream sandwich.  What a wonderful meal, I would love to come back!",

    "text": "Pork and Beans is hands down the best bbq in Pittsburgh. For a little background, of the 5 of us that ate there on Saturday, 2 of us are official judges with Kansas City Bbg Society (KCBS) a group that sanctions bbq competion world wide. We have all eaten bbq from the best in the U.S. We ordered a vast sampling of the menu including the coffee dusted wings (incedible), jalapeno cornbread balls, (very nice) and then the meats. Since this is all served family style piled on a tray Texas style, we all decided to sample hard. The meats were tri-tip, pork ribs, brisket, beer can chicken with piri-piri sauce. Our sides were the collard greens, mac and cheese, bbq beans w/brisket. Our waitress was great. She explained what everything was, reviewed all the available sauces, and was knowledgeble about the whole operation. In the bbq world, brisket is the hardest meat to cook properly. P&B has nailed it. Juicy and flavorful while being extremely tender, without being over smoked. Just outstanding. Tri-tip is a rare treat as it is mostly served in the west. It too was beefy and tender, sliced thin and served med. rare. The chicken was a little spicy for some of our group, but was cooked perfect. The white meat was moist and tender, a big challenge for most cooks. The ribs were fall of the bone tender, but still had a nice texture and were not mushy or overcooked. Collard greens were perfect, tender, but still had a firmness to them, not too salty like some get, and had a nice flavor from the cooking liquid. Next, mac and cheese. They had a perfect ratio of pasta vs. cheese with a nice bit of a crunchy bread crumb topping. Exactly the way you wished mom would make it. Last, the bbq beans. Since beans are dish that seems to be one that people either like in general or never eat at all, these were very good. They had chunks of brisket mixed into a spicy sauce and a variety of different beans resulting in a nice flavor and varing textures of the mixed beans. We had more food than we could eat, which allowed for a nice bag of leftovers to take with us. I would like to comment on the pricing of the meats offered. Some people will be suprised at the cost of the meat which is sold by the half pound. You need to know that to cook bbq like this requires extremely long hours and you need to start with high quality meat. A brisket takes up to 16 hours to get to this level of tenderness. You also need to tend to it, not just throw in the smoker and walk away. The brisket served at Pork & Beans is as good as you will find in any place in the country. I've tried.  Overall, the experience at Pork & Beans was what I dreamed about for Pittsburgh. While every menu item won't be your favorite, the combination of appetizers, sides, and meats to choose from will leave you planning your next visit while still enjoying your current one. This, my friends, is the real deal. Eat up and \"Get fat-n-happy\"!",

    "text": "Maybe it was because I had lowered expectations due to the somewhat lukewarm reception to Pork and Beans here on Yelp, but the food and experience here pretty much blew away what I was expecting going in.  Like the other restaurants ran by Deshantz, Pork and Beans has an eclectic and fun atmosphere inside.  Wooden booths, long communal tables, silverware placed in coffee cans, food is served on cafeteria trays, it's definitely a hip place.   I wanted to start off by saying that my father and I had reservations beforehand regarding the portion sizes, as we weren't sure how much a 1/2 pound (which is how the meats are sold) really was.  We ended up ordering 4 different meats, including the spare ribs, brisket, tri-tip, and pulled pork, along with just one side of the wedged potatoes as well as the catfish sliders.  We ordered way too much, as the food was much more filling than it looked, and we actually took a good amount to go because we couldn't finish it all.  This was probably the first time I've taken food home with me in years.  Everything was delicious, but the spare ribs were easily our favorite.  Even something as simple as the potato wedges were awesome.  They weren't greasy, and had a nice, crispy and crunchy texture on the outside with a soft potato bite on the inside.  The sauces on the table were alright, but nothing special in my opinion.  After trying a little bit of each on the pulled pork, I actually found myself preferring to eat the food as is without the extra condiments.    This is easily the best food I've had of this kind, but I do have to note that I haven't had much experience before when it comes to these new age BBQ joints.  I'm sure that places like Frankin's and Pappy's Smokehouse are next level grub, but Pork and Beans made me a believer in this type of food and I for sure will be visiting again in the near future.",

And the waitress never came pass to say anything about why the food was taking so long. No ice in the water it's served out of green old wine bottles chilled at first but as long as we waited all we had to drink was warm water our appetizers were long gone! It was Mother's Day and we were hungry and I ordered a peach drink but it was actually what looked and tasted like a mojito minus the mint leaves! I'm just saying cause it was a $10 drink and the waitress took it without asking was I finished with it!!!! I give it 2 stars because I was so hungry I did eat the food! But the service was horrible folks just walking back and forth appearing to be doing NOTHING!!!!! And when you look over and see people that literally just came in and they are being served their full meals not appetizers it makes you say \"WE AINT NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN\"",

    "text": "I absolutely love Meat & Potatoes, Butcher and The Rye, and tako, so I was really hoping to love Pork & Beans too. Sadly, my husband and I were both very disappointed.  First of all, the seating is so uncomfortable. Neither one of us mind communal seating on occasion, but the tables were very cramped. If there could have been even one less couple seated in our row, that would have helped. My husband had to wiggle between strangers to sit on a shared bench and there was no room to move our elbows. Keep in mind, we are not large people. Everyone around us could listen in on our conversation and neither one of us could relax.  Though the bar program was interesting, resonably priced, and seemed to be well-managed, the kitchen was not. As we were heading to a show in 2 hours, we immediately ordered drinks, an appetizer (Dirty Fries), and our entrees (Brisket, BBQ Bone Marrow, and Mac & Cheese). When the server realized we were ordering everything at once, I informed her that we were trying to catch a show. She said she understood and our drinks arrived shortly after. As the kitchen staff delivers and clears the dishes (not the server herself), our appetizer was delivered to the wrong couple in our row. This was quickly resolved. We then waited another 1-1/2 hours for our entrees during which 2 couples in our row were seated, served, AND cashed out. By the time our server came back to check on us, the show was starting in 30 minutes so I asked for the check. She promised our entrees would be coming out shortly, but I suspected that our entrees were delivered to another couple in our row just as our appetizer had. Another 15 minutes later (that's 15 minutes before the show), I asked our server to box everything up as it was time to leave. Within minutes, someone else delivered our food in a to-go bag. Our server offered an apology for the wait, but was not able to explain how everyone else in our row was served before us and did not do anything to rectify the situation. We paid full price and I left her a 20% tip. In hindsight, I probably could have rejected the food or requested a discount or shorted her tip but I just do not feel right about doing things like that. Honestly, I thought a restaurant in the Meat & Potatoes family would have offered to make it right but no such luck. That's very disappointing and management should take note.  Again, the drinks were good and delivered promptly. Once we finally got to try the entrees after the show, we were not that impressed. Everyone raves about the brisket but honestly, you can get better brisket at Double Wide Grill. The BBQ sauces are watery, the macaroni and cheese is bland, and I swear you can buy the same dinner rolls at a grocery store. The Dirty Fries and the BBQ Bone Marrow were actually pretty good and were the only redeeming part of our experience.  To summarize, we waited 2 hours in cramped uncomfortable seating to eat our cold food at home 3 hours later. So very disappointed, Pork & Beans. We will not be returning. :(",

    "text": "Let me just come out and say this bluntly: Pork and Beans is incredibly lame.  It is masquerading as some pseudo-hipster eatery for all the old people downtown that want to eat at the newest and hippest restaurants before watching a mediocre performance of classical thunder at Heinz Hall.  For that, it is probably just fine.  For everything else, this place is one joke after another.  First off, they are trying way too hard with decor.  The barn wood look has become passe very quickly in the restaurant world, but they're clinging onto it for dear life.  If you get seated in a booth, a nautical rope limits you to a narrow walkway to leave your table that is usually filled by servers.  Going to the bathroom is like trying to use the restroom on an airplane when the flight attendants have the drink cart out.  Not smart.  The old signs and crap on the wall evokes Applebees or TGI Fridays, not a real restaurant.  Service is fine, but our busboy aggressively cleared our table WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING.  He even picked up my water glass (full) and my beer (half full) and placed my beer glass in my dirty plate.  When I said something, he handed back the glass that he had touched (grabbed it by the rim with all fingers) and doused in sauce.  Thanks, pal. That beer cost me like $8 and I was only allowed to drink half of it without some dude rubbing his fingers all over it.  I also did not have any water to wash anything down with.    The beer list is long but lacking local flavor.  At this point, if you want to have 20 taps in a bar in Pittsburgh, you better have a handful of local delights.  They did not.  Nothing on tap from Gristhouse, Roundabout, Hop Farm, Brew Gentlemen, Draii Laag, etc.  They have some overpriced bottles of Gristhouse beer and, wait for it, Rivertown and North Country.  Anyone who remotely likes local beer knows that Rivertowne and North Country are the worst and least respected local beers.  Total failure all around on a restaurant the waiter told us was \"beer focused.\"  Really?  Also, the beers are all about $2 more than they should be.  The food was actually decent, which is why I am giving this place 2 stars.  If it wasn't trying so hard (and failing) to be something its not, it would be worthwhile.  Also, they have a menu advertising \"Smirnoff Ice\" to \"ice your friends\" for $5.  This wins the award for the most cringe-worthy menu item, and this would have still been lame 10 years ago when that was a thing in popular culture.  It was douchy then and even douchier now.  This place owes me a refund, especially because they ruined my beer.  I tipped well because I didn't want the servers to get screwed for mistakes made by the management, which appear to be plentiful.",

Having had a fair amount of BBQ over the last week this meal really stood out from the rest. Everything was fantastic. I loved the vibe of the place and tunes they were playing. Los of folks sitting outside and they have what looks like three garage doors that open up to let the outside in.   Service was friendly and efficient. I loved the big bottle of tap water at the table and the can with all the utensils in it and even the way they brought the bill was cool - in an old soup (clean) can. Not sure, but the can might be a nod to Andy Warhol who apparently hailed from these parts.   Already planning a return trip to Pittsburgh with one of the goals to come back here.",

There are unique items like a Vegan Falafel Wrap and Korean Pulled Pork. To just try the normal pulled pork or brisket, you get half a pound which is enough to share with plenty of people. It also comes with pickled onions, radishes, and dill pickles. You can order large sides for sharing as well, and I tried the french fries which were thick cut and fried perfectly. It also came with rolls. The food is awesome! They also have a selection of different BBQ sauces you can choose from. A must try if you are in the area!",

I would recommend the brisket. For the price, I wish the portions were just a little bigger though!

The burger was boring and not crisp at all. When it says smashed griddle burger that's what I expected. Normally I wouldn't get a burger at a bbq joint, but they sold me with the tittle. The buffalo parmesan wings were sweet. No tang or heat. They also lacked any smoked flavor. It wasn't bad I just had high hopes.  It's a cool place with a fun menu the food just didn't quite land.",

They do smoked meats very well. And they do all their accompanying sides from scratch and very well. For example, the burnt ends baked beans are from scratch with FRESH beans!!!  You can tell because the beans aren't overly mushy! The macaroni & cheese was outstanding & Homemade. The macaroni wasn't mushy!!! It cooked al dente & had fresh toasted breadcrumbs & fresh green onion topping it! The choice of BBQ sauces is varied with something to accommodate everyone's palate. You cannot go wrong here. Just go early or be prepared to wait. It's worth it. This is how 'Que is done!",

My boyfriend ordered the jalapeno sausage with chips. Anytime we go I always like his food better than mine. The sausage was flavorful and bbq chips were great. My pulled pork lacked flavor and the beans had an after taste that was less than appealing. Our waitress was very nice and made frequent rounds to see how we were.

I originally was going to a fancier place for a chef's tasting menu but ended up opting for something more comforting after nursing a hangover earlier that day lol. I came in during happy hour and sat at the packed bar. There was one seat left just for me. I didn't drink for the aforementioned reason but the bartenders, excuse me, mixologists were legit. Shaking, stirring, sprinkling and garnishing their hearts out.   I ordered pork rinds, wings, and crab jalapeno fritters on happy hour; I later ordered the dirty fries because Yelp! The pork rinds, cracklins, chicharron depending on whom you ask and where they're from, were delicious. I've had some bland rinds. These were tastily seasoned and maybe even brined, because the flavor was throughout, before being dried and deep fried to puffy goodness.The wings were smoky and I ordered hot honey which made for a good combination. The fritters were hushpuppy-esque which I like so I could have done without the crab and just throw in some cheddar. All the textures of the dirty fries were awesome but honestly I was full by the time I ordered them so I packed them pretty soon after receiving them. Luckily they were delicious Monday for lunch. All the flavors: cheese, BBQ sauce, onion, jalapeno and smoky brisket had melded together (successfully making everyone in the break room jealous) and tasted great!",

    "text": "My husband and I popped into Pork & Beans on a rainy Saturday for lunch. The restaurant was totally dead - there may have been one other table occupied. So the vibes weren't exactly jumping, but we still had a good time. I ordered a Founders All Day IPA since I didn't want to drink anything too boozy. It arrived in a 19.2 oz pounder can. That's probably a fact that should be printed on the menu somewhere. Nonetheless, I settled in with my extra large can.   The menu is much shorter for lunch than the full menu we looked at online, and some items don't really have descriptions. For example, the salads are listed as cobb, caesar, etc. with nothing else to tell you what's actually in them. To our surprise, no meats were on the lunch menu at all - it was mostly sandwiches, small plates and sides. We decided to order a handful of things to share: the cuban sandwich, poutine tater tots, burnt end beans and collard greens.   The food arrived and it was more than enough for the two of us. That said, the sandwich was surprisingly small, but delicious. I loved the collard greens as well. The poutine was a little too heavy on the cheese (never thought I'd say that about cheese!) - I found myself searching for tots with minimal toppings. The beans were solid.   Though Pork & Beans was a little different from what I expected, I still liked it a lot. I do think they should be a bit more transparent with menu descriptions, and also post the lunch menu online since it varies so much from the dinner menu.",

I got the brisket and tri-tip, and my girlfriend got the brisket and pork belly pastrami as the meats and we got the French fries, Mac n cheese x2), and potato salad as the sides.   While I still think it is a step down from Austin, Texas brisket, this is a quality cut of meat. Juicy and flavorful, I found myself savoring the experience with all five senses. The tri-tip was fine too- I would have liked mine a little less cooked, but the burnt ends were delicious. Lastly, the pork belly pastrami was a over average as well, and paired so nicely with the seasonal sauce they had which was an Asian bbq type of thing. All are served with pickles, onions and bread. The pickles are actually also worth mentioning as stand-out.   The fries were more of wedges which were ok. The Mac n cheese and potato salad were both very good- we wish we got more!   Great beer selection, aesthetics, and flavor bring this place together as a BBQ must-taste in Pittsburgh. They've got some good chefs and equipment back there, bringing some much-needed southern flavor to the northeast.",

    "text": "Because we love all of Richard Deshantz's restaurants and were sad to see Keith Fuller's Root 174 close, my husband and I looked forward to trying their joint effort, Pork and Beans. Not only do we LOVE BBQ, but we also admire what these to are doing in and for the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.   We made reservations with another couple for a Tuesday night. Our friends arrived early and each ordered a scotch before we arrived. They did order good scotch, but were rather surprised at the $47 bill for two small pours. But, they enjoyed it and sipped contentedly throughout dinner.   When we arrived we were seated quickly, in a booth to the right. The space is open with muted lighting. There are long wooden tables with benches in the center, and a row of booths to the right. By the bar area there is a long high table for standing and enjoying your drink. I imagine this gets busy at happy hour! So seating is truly at a minimum, which is par for the course for downtown.   Once seated, we ordered our drinks. I chose the Repo Man, a tequila-based cocktail, and my husband had the Tennessee Ninja Mint Julep. They were both small pours and my husband's ended up being too sweet for him, so I kindly switched. (Aren't I the greatest wife ever?!) I will probably stick to ordering cocktails mainly at Meat and Potatoes or Bar Marco.   The food, while tasty, was not any better than our favorite BBQ place in Brookline, the Smoq Pitt. We started off with boiled in-shell peanuts, which are interesting and authentically southern yet not my favorite eat peanuts. Our main courses arrived only a few minutes after the peanuts, so we did not have much time for appetizers.   The servings at Pork and Beans are small, yet because they serve it family style there appears to be more than there is. My husband and our friends got the beef brisket, and I had the pulled pork. Sauces on the table include a spicy, sweet, hot, and mustard-based sauce. The pork was very lean, missing the fat of a normal cut of pork shoulder or butt. The sauce added some much-needed flavor. My husband said the brisket was good, but again not better than Smoq Pitt, and a much smaller portion for the price. We also had collard greens, which were unremarkable and not nearly as flavorful as they should be. They needed more pork flavor or bacon added. My husband tried the beans, which reminded him of a family reunion kind of dish, sweet and slightly bland. I am gluten free so I did not partake of the bread provided, but it looked to be simply buns or rolls that you could buy at Giant Eagle.   Overall, now that I am writing this review, I realize I am more disappointed than I originally thought. I know the restaurant is new and they are probably still figuring out the kinks, but I had expected more from such a prestigious pair. My husband thinks we should go back and try the more unique items on the menu, which I am happy to do to give this place another try.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to try this restaurant since I saw it was coming soon quite awhile ago, and I am so glad I did. I really enjoyed the decor - they went for a rustic, classy redneck vibe.  There are communal tables and an area with individual tables.  The individual table area is set up with mason jar string lights and a VFW sign above it and it was fun to look at all the interesting details. We sat in the communal dining section.  I am always nervous about communal dining since you never know who you'll be sitting next to.  When we were seated there was a large man to my right, which did impose on my personal space a bit.  Luckily, they left shortly after we arrived.  The couple to our right was very friendly and we had a casual conversation with them on and off throughout the night.   My husband pointed out that the DeShantz group really likes their alcohol.  One of my favorite things about their restaurants is that they all have different focuses on their alcohols.  Pork and Beans had a pretty extensive beer selection.   As for the food - we ordered the pastrami pork belly and brisket.  They do an excellent job of making the food easy to share, which was wonderful.  The pork belly had a wonderful peppered crust, but the brisket really put it to shame.  It was so tender and a good amount of smokey flavor.  I wanted to taste their various bbq sauces, but I really felt bad ruining the brisket that way.   There are so many more things on the menu I want to test out and try that I'm sure we'll be returning.  Once again, the DeShantz Restaurant group hit it out of the park!",

The service here is always awkward, not sure why but haven't had super good service. The corn side dish is great. Every app we have gotten has been disappointing, really salty, small and not memorable, i cant remember their names. I think one was pork rinds, another was potato skins maybe? That one was super small. I believe the sandwich i got was the pulled pork grilled cheese, it was very salty, so be aware! I heavily salt our food at home, and i took the other half of the sandwich home, just too much! Wont come back here unless we can't get reservations elsewhere  (the reason we came here twice)",

Now I've traveled a lot and have tasted a lot of barbecue. I would say this is similar to Texas style barbecue. It's not the top 3 I've ever had in the US, but it's the best in Pittsburgh!

    "text": "We went to Pork & Beans recently to celebrate my husband's birthday, and I'm so glad we chose to celebrate there! Since we'd never been, we took advantage of the ability to try a bunch of things via their \"family style\" menu, paired with the Blue Plate Special (gives you smaller portions of two meats and two sides). Everything we had was phenomenal, cooked perfectly and exactly what we were hoping for. We also took advantage of their really great happy hour specials - $5 craft beers and select $5 appetizers. The Buffalo Stout smoked chicken wings were the perfect start to our meal. The a la carte sides were a bit on the pricey side for what you get, but they were delicious as well and I think that it was worth the opportunity to try them! We will absolutely be back next time we're looking for good BBQ.",

    "text": "I'm going middle of the road on this one because I think it has potential, but there are a lot of little annoyances that really pile up.   The good... - The food was very flavorful overall and the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork.    We sampled the brisket, the dirty fries, and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was a little bland, but the meal showed a lot of promise.  There isn't a really good barbeque place in town, so this fills a void.   - The portions are pretty large overall.  The place seems geared toward a family style type of ordering process, which is what I would recommend.   We paid $34 for the food part of our meal, which was more than enough for two people.  You could very easily spend 2-3 times as much depending on what you order, but there is a range of options.   - The service.  For a new restaurant, the service was decent.  It took a long time to get the check; but other than that, he was friendly and was around when needed.  I also like that they pack the leftovers for you when it's time to go.     The annoyances... - The plates are way too small.  We got a lunch tray with our food and then two tiny side plates.  No room to arrange a meal on the plate or sample the sauces.  At best, you can get a few bites of one or two things at a time on that plate.       - The seating arrangement is not awesome.  \"Our\" table, when it was ready, turned out to be a communal table up front.  I had a humongous table leg directly in front of me, so I had to sit awkwardly and was super close to the strangers on either side of me.  There was no place for my purse or jacket at all.  When our server came to fill our waters, he could barely squeeze in to reach them.  From my seat, I couldn't reach any of the sauces, silverware, paper towels, etc. without asking a stranger to pass them over.  As a result, I only tried one sauce.   - Our food was cold.  Both the brisket and mac and cheese were served lukewarm at best.  I chalk that up to the newness of the place, but it did affect my overall meal.   - So noisy.  We had to shout across the table to hear each other.   That combined with being so close to other patrons made conversation sort of awkward.  I couldn't hear the server and he couldn't hear me.  The decor is not in any way designed to knock down the noise level, so be prepared.    - Canned wine.  Now, I am a cheap wine connoisseur and can absolutely appreciate a can of wine; however, I cannot appreciate a $24 can of wine.  It was pretty decent tasting and I did appreciate that it was two glasses at once (so I didn't have to make that poor server squish in to serve me another), but I feel like you've got to have a lot of nerve to charge $24 for a can of wine.    All in all, it's another DeShantz restaurant.  Overdone and a little pretentious.  Prices on the highest end of reasonable, but with food that stands up.",

The atmosphere is great- there is a mix of booths, communal, and bar seating, and is very hipster chic. If you love beer, the menu was huge and fairly priced. They also had a few ciders on the menu, which was nice to see. We ordered the pig ears, pulled pork, and mac and cheese- all 3 were great, and the mac and cheese was the best I had in a long time (it has crumbled BBQ chips on top!).   For my food allergy friends out there, Pork and Beans was incredibly accommodating. My waiter made sure everything was safe and really went out of his way to make sure I could enjoy my whole dining experience, which is honestly rare to find these days. I can't wait to come back and try out more of the menu next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

They included a healthy serving of brisket chunks with each one.   7. We ordered 1/2 lb of pulled pork and 1/2 lb of brisket.   It was cooked very well.  The char on the brisket was exceptional. Served family style which was bonus.  8. The cucumber onion side salad was heavy with vintages.  I liked. My wife not so much.  9.   Good value in the city.

Fried potato chunks, pork belly, onions, scallions, and jalapenos were smothered in this creamy savory BBQ/mayo/honey mustard sauce. Definitely a must order! The brisket was juicy, tender, and fatty while the steak tips were more meaty and had more of a bit to it. Both were seasoned well, and the variety of homemade sauces (classic, hot, mustard, seasonal) was a nice touch as well, although they were a bit on the watery side. The mac and cheese was also deliciously creamy, cheesy, and had a nice crunch with breadcrumbs on top. My boyfriend had first ordered the ribs, but they had run out by the time they started preparing our order. The server and a manager came out and apologized to us and offered another meat choice on the house. This was a very nice surprise and more than made up for it - we would have had no problem choosing something else and paying for it, but the fact that they offered a replacement for free showed how much they cared about good service and keeping the customer happy. We will definitely be back!",

Our friendly but absent waitress offered no explanation for the slow drinks and thought we would be delighted with how quickly the food was presented.    Much has been said about the terrible seating arrangements so I'll skip that critique and focus more on the one thing that can save an otherwise poor restaurant: the food. We ordered 4 meats and 2 sides after being steered away from going the sandwich route by our server.    The broccoli slaw was excellent. The fries were strictly average.  The sandwich rolls they brought out with our family-style platter were still connected, obviously right out of a bag and not homemade. We were given 4.    And, BOY, what a sad little platter of meat.  When I saw how paltry my \"half pound\" of brisket was I assumed I was in for a real treat, some truly extraordinary smoked meat.  What I tasted barely passed for BBQ.   The meat breakdown:  Brisket: adequate tenderness but with a huge ribbon of fat. NO SMOKE flavor.   Pulled pork: heavily brined, NO SMOKE. Extremely over-cooked and had the consistency of meat paste. Nearly inedible.   Ribs: tasted exactly the same as the brisket. No unique flavor and again NO SMOKE.   Chicken wasn't bad at all. But nothing special.    Sauces: extremely poor, ranging from the too-vinegar-y \"hot\" to the absolutely terrible \"classic\" that tastes not unlike the stuff you get in the packet at Chil Fil A.  They need to source this stuff from people who know how to make sauces until they can figure it out.    The prices and portion sizes are criminal. $46 for 2 beers, slaw, and brisket!  If you have any exposure to good BBQ from places like Texas, Carolinas, Memphis, or my hometown of KC you are not going to be happy with your food.  Throw in bad service, bad seating, and a slow bar.  This place won't make it another year once word of mouth spreads.",

We liked the Classic sauce the best.   For sides we had Mac & Cheese (which was awesome) and Burnt End Beans. Their beans are more savory (strong tomato base) than sweet, which i'm not used to, but still enjoyed.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I did not enjoy the drink I ordered. I thought i ordered a Peach Daiquiri but instead I got what looked and tasted like a lime Margarita...without ice. It was a bit strange.

    "text": "I honestly feel guilty giving this place 3 stars.  I have made four trips prior to writing this review, and if I had reviewed after the first two trips my rating would have been 5 stars, but the quality has gone down hill in the recent past. I've had quite a few items off of their menu, and although many of the items were super tasty and well executed, but the pulled pork these past 2 visits has been so salty that it was inedible (for me, my husband powered through it because...barbecue).  I could feel my blood pressure soaring with each bite--it was really disappointing because the pulled pork was out of this world the first two times I visited. I'll probably still be back because I love the atmosphere and their draft list is on point. Their Mac and cheese is always worth a taste and the street corn is tasty, too.",

    "text": "What is the hype all about?  To say we were disappointed is an understatement!  We started with a Frito Pie; salad with a few hunks of brisket and a couple of corn chip strips. Main course; brisket and pulled pork with collard greens and corn. Brisket was DRY, pulled pork was ok, certainly nothing special, even the collard greens ( usually my absolute favorite) were terrible. Actually, when our tray was cleared the greens and brisket were largely untouched. The corn was definitely the highest point of the meal.   My daughter has a gluten allergy which we stated as soon as we sat down. We of course asked what was gf and ok for her to eat. Our waitress had to go back and forth to the kitchen to inquire individually for each entree/side instead of asking  the kitchen about all of the gf options upfront. Very frustrating!  The servers that we encountered  simply served, no personality. They never even asked if our meal was ok or wondered why we sent back most of our brisket and collards.   Give all of BBQ choices in Pittsburgh I'd stay away from this one. The place was pretty much empty at 8 on a Saturday night.....no fun vibe like we expected.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with the food at Pork and Beans. It seems much effort went in to creating this BBQ joint scene but without working through the food. Brisket  - at least Texas style BBQ brisket, which is what I've read Richard DeShantz was going for - is cooked low and slow and the fat melts basting the meat in juices to keep it moist. However, the Pork and Beans brisket was dry and my portion had a large fat marble going through it - obviously this has not been cooked properly.  My husband's order of pulled pork was equally too dry. The sides were not particularly good. Everything was just marginal in flavor and without the flavor being there - the price comes across as way out of line for the quality.   Food Order:  Dirty Fries - I guess this is their take on poutine, but the meat was from the ribs and it was just not good - the overall dish didn't gel in terms of flavors.  Brisket - 1/2 lb overall too dry and fat not rendered from meat. Pulled Pork - 1/2 lb too dry also but decent flavor.  Bread - quite boring rolls - why not partner with Mancini's and do some kind of jalapeno cheese bread to spice it up...a la Goode Co. BBQ in Houston, Tx. Or, better yet - Southern style savory jalapeno cornbread.  Loaded Potato Salad - average flavor profile. Could come out of any kitchen Burnt End Beans - basic flavor and not helped by the usually delicious burnt ends. Sauces - All were TOO SWEET!  Texas sauce is absolutely not sweet. Cranberry sauce?  Get the basics down before you get artistic and seasonal bbq sauce.   Prices:  EDIT TO ADD:  It has been brought to my attention that I am mistaken about the meat portions at Pork and Beans. You DO, in fact, get a 1/2 lb of meat for the prices listed below. Apologies to Pork and Beans folks for this unintentional error. This does bring their prices in line with other BBQ joints and I'm glad to have been given this correction. Thank you for setting me straight.  1/4 lb (actually 1/2 lb) Brisket for $14???  In Houston I get 1/2 lb DELICIOUS brisket for $12  1/4 lb (actually 1/2 lb) Pulled Pork for $10? In Houston I get 1/2 lb spicy pork for $10 Sides now $8 (instead of 5 or 10) with no size listed other than \"small\" or \"large\".  Houston sides - any: (Jalapeno Pinto Beans, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, Jambalaya Texana, Austin Baked Beans or Goode's Western Style Green Beans) for Pint $7 or 1/2 Pint $5  Come on, Richard DeShantz, get Pork and Beans sorted - way too pricey for the amount of meat you get and the flavor of the food. BBQ ain't supposed to break the bank. I know you can do better than this.  Additional note about Pork & Beans:  The service was very good at Pork and Beans and it is a very neat concept, with a cool vibe and atmosphere. I think once they hit their stride with the food, this joint will be a fantastic place to eat.",

In addition, I admit, we ordered 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine, as well.  The total layout including tip was 90 buckaroos.  Sorry, nowhere else do we opt to dine in such a casual atmosphere, dining on comfort food for that much money.  For that threshold, I would like to be wined and dined in a much more romantic ambiance and my food presentation spectacular, as well.  At the very least, that price point would require a table for two, not a communal table with strangers and paper towels instead of cloth napkins for such a casual fare as BBQ.  (Just for the record I'm all for casual and getting to know my dining partners, just not for 90 bucks.)  Yes, the food is good.  just not gonna do it again for the price.  Too many options in Pittsburgh up for grabs, BBQ or not.",

I had the wings, and they were exceptional. As always, the Mac & cheese was excellent, our drinks were tasty, and the service was impeccable. I'm definitely glad I gave this place another chance, since it's so convenient to the cultural district. Highly recommend!  The first time I visited Pork & Beans, I was extremely impressed. The brisket grilled cheese was to die for, and the Mac and cheese was awesome. Unfortunately, after a few repeat visits, I've noticed the quality of the food going downhill slightly - the brisket isn't as good and the ratio of cheese to meat seems off. Their drinks, however, are always excellent. Service is great, and it's a good place to visit if you're looking for tasty food with generally quick service in a laid back atmosphere. Hopefully, I can visit again and am  why I loved this restaurant in the first place!",

This is the same owners as Meat & Potatoes (one of my fav restaurants in Pgh) so I was really looking forward to trying it out! I went on a hot July evening with my mom and sister. They sat us all the way in the very back of the restaurant next to the bathrooms. Which I usually freaking hate, but atleast it was a private booth compared to those long picnic tables they sit multiple parties at.  Also, the air conditioning was broken and it was deathly hot inside. Like there was no way I could enjoy a meal with sweat dripping. To top off my unpleasant experience, there is absolutely 0 service in that building. I asked the waitress for the WiFi password and she said it's not public. Whatever.  I was expecting the decor to be bbq themed but it was more of an outhouse/ rickety old shack theme. Def didn't match with their upscale prices. I can't even really remember the meal I had, due to it not being very memorable. The dirty fries were good, but the bbq entrees fell flat. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon! Sorry!",

    "text": "I stopped at Pork & Beans with a buddy for dinner on a Saturday night and was very pleased with the quality of food and service. We sat along the front patio in order to take in the scenery. They only downer about that is that cigarette smoke would occasionally waft by from somewhere else on the street (not something that Pork & Beans can control, you know?).  The hostess and server were both very friendly, and offered honest recommendations. I asked the server about the size of the pulled pork quesadilla appetizer, and she rightly told me that it was large enough to be a meal. I ordered that along with some mac and cheese, while my buddy ordered tri tip and burnt end beans.  It took a bit of time for the food to arrive, but it just gave us more time to enjoy a pleasant summer evening. The quesadilla was large- similar in size to what you would receive at Qdoba or another Mexican restaurant. It was full of pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and cheese, and topped with a chipolte crema. If you're a fan of those ingredients, you'll like this dish (I wouldn't have minded a little less of the crema, though).   The mac and cheese was wonderful. It tasted like it was freshly made, unlike the majority of BBQ joints I've been to. The mac and cheese had a hint of spiciness to it, and a delicious bread crumb crust on top. Honestly, I would have been full with half the quesadilla and the mac and cheese.  I tried my friend's baked beans, which had a nice depth of flavor. They are spicy, so you might want to skip them if you don't like the heat. I didn't taste the tri tip, but my buddy gave it a thumbs up.  Overall, I would recommend Pork & Beans as a BBQ place to visit when you are downtown. Friendly service, great food (and lots of it), and at a reasonable price- if you can hit all three of those pillars at a BBQ joint, how can you go wrong?",

Mac and cheese: this is where most fail; Pork & beans does not. Cheesy, well seasoned, good cracker crumble topping to give a nice crunch. Very satisfying indeed.   Brisket sandwich: well I was really craving a burger today so ill go with the next closest thing, the brisket sandwich. I tend to shy away from BBQ sandwiches as I feel the meat shouldn't share the spotlight, but this is a near perfect sandwich! Crunchy raw white onions alongside a pillowy soft bun, tangy brisket alongside 'sweet butter pickles'. This is like the culinary version of our government, all about checks and balances. Well except these balances actually work in my favor and don't only have it's own interest in mind. Sorry, what were we talking about again? Oh yeah, get this sandwich!   There's no perfect BBQ restaurant experience. What I find is either the meat shines or the sides shine, never really both. Best meat ever? no. Best sides ever? Not really. But this is probably as close as I have come to conquering both in one sitting, and the satisfaction meter has spoken. If I gave Pork & Beans anything less than a 4.5 overall, my stomach would call me a liar....",

It also only had about 5 small bits of brisket.  We ordered the pork belly, it was pretty good, but we should have went with the brisket. Cole slaw although not on the menu was amazing, vinegar-based with apple. Amazing flavors just ask for it.  Lastly came the ultimate disappointment, NO CORNBREAD??!!!!???! WHAT?!? A bar-b-que joint that doesn't sell cornbread. The meat was served with a store bought potato roll.  Come on Pork and Beans you can do better.",

With little in my stomach aside from a croissant, which was downed in a hurried rush as I boarded the plane, we set off to find something a bit more filling than usual.  We ordered the blue plate special with pastrami pork belly and brisket to share, even though the waitress suggested otherwise. The portion was absolutely massive and more than enough. Both meats were decent. Nothing to write home about. Then the waitress walked by us with a side of pulled pork for another table and we both knew that we had to have it - and what a decision that turned out to be. It was absolutely delicious, both well seasoned and tender, and totally worth the extra binge. And the brocolli salad. Absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to be back next time I find myself in Pittsburgh.",

Maria, the hostess, didn't even look at me when I asked her if it was open seating and she said no. With no further niceties, she grabbed two menus and just started walking to the back of the restaurant. There were maybe 8-10 people in the restaurant total on a Monday at 6:00. She seated us in a booth all the way in back next to the kitchen. We passed 6 open booths on the way to the back. I asked Maria if we could sit somewhere else away from the kitchen. She looked at me, literally rolled her eyes at me, turned and walked towards the front of the restaurant without saying a word. So instead of seating us at another table or booth, she seated us at a long table with barstools and no back in the bar area. The place was wide open. Food is very good. The prices are OK until you realize basics aren't included. An $18 prime rib dip sandwich comes with chips. Fries are an additional $1.99. It's the same for all sandwiches. Despite the good food, I'd skip returning to this one due to the poor overall bad taste in my mouth.",

I personally don't believe that good BBQ must come from a divey hole in the wall. This place is upscale, but I assure you it is delicious.   The drink menu is solid. Good, diverse list of draft beers. Some fun stuff like pickle backs, boilermakers, and slushies. A good variety of cocktails in terms of spirits and flavors.   But you're here for the meat. I believe the turkey is the best I've ever had. The tri tip is also incredible. All four sauces (one rotates seasonally) are very good. The tri tip is so good that even a sauce fan like myself does not want to taint the excellent flavor with sauce.   The sides are actually just ok. Haven't been knocked out by any of the 5 or so I've tried. The ambience is hip and the service has always been strong.   Despite the sides being average, I have to give five stars. Because the meat, man. Isn't that really what you're here for?",

Bigger plates needed (or give pieces of paper for bbq as plates like they do in TX at bbq joints) versus the small plates we received and spoons.  We made reservations and sat at a booth on the side. Food is for sharing. Very wood heavy decor with pops of modernity like the bar stools. Apparently the bathroom is interesting so will need to check that out on our return visit.

    "text": "Exactly what downtown Pittsburgh was missing: good BBQ! Everything we tried was amazing, but my favorite would have to be the brisket: incredibly moist and flavorful with the perfect bit of smoked flavor. All the meats had an incredible rub on them. In fact, I don't think any additional sauce was needed on any of the meats. However, there were four different bottles of sauces (an original sweet sauce, tangy Carolina style sauce, a hot sauce similar to Franks, and a seasonal) at each table in case you like your BBQ extra saucy. My favorite sauce was the seasonal cranberry BBQ sauce but I presume that sauce will rotate.   As with any other Richard DeShantz restaurant (Meat and Potatoes, Tako, Butcher and the Rye), you are guaranteed a wonderful dining experience from the themed decor to the service to the food, but also expect the large bill at the end of your visit.    Some things to note, however, are the awkward communal tables and shared sink in the bathrooms. Try to get a booth if you can. Otherwise, you'll be elbow to elbow with strangers. Also, the food comes out in a family-style tray without any type of order. So to avoid the confusion of what is whose, I would recommend ordering the menu items with the intention of sharing them with your group.   Overall, if you can get over the awkward dining situation, I highly recommend the food and drinks!",

A conveniently located parking garage that could fit my truck in was right above the restaurant and was an easy walk to the elevator and pay station for the garage. The bbq sauces to me seemed very watered down and limited on flavor. I do not know if I will be back.",

I passed it on a Saturday and the garage doors were open, people dined outside, and looked so happy that I had to try it last night. We were not disappointed!  We made reservations a few days before...like I said the place is new and bumpin' so you'll want to get a seat! The menu is  available online and we almost had our minds made up until we heard the specials! I posted a few pics of our dishes and everyone was extremely happy and bellies were filled! They have large portions so be ready!",

    "text": "What a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh barbecue scene! The 'burgh has been lacking some truly authentic barbecue, so Pork and Beans is definitely a welcome change.  The atmosphere is trendy - comparable to many of the other \"hipster\" type restaurants that have been opening lately. I noticed that a few of the art pieces came locally from Tollgate Revival in Lawrenceville, which I appreciated. The food is all it's hyped up to be. We started with three different appetizers: the Frito pie, barbecue chips, and the dirty fries. We all agreed that the dirty fries were our favorite. They came topped with pork, which was an awesome touch and definitely upped the flavor level. We then ordered the pulled pork, brisket, and grilled chicken, as well as a few sides: loaded potato salad, baked beans, and mac and cheese. The quality of the food was everything I had hoped it would be. My top recommendations out of everything we tried would be the pulled pork, loaded potato salad, and the baked beans. Everyone in our party left totally stuffed and satisfied.  Pork and Beans unfortunately still has some issues to work through on the service side. There just weren't enough servers for the extremely high volume of people. Our waitress was upbeat, but she didn't come around as often as we would have liked. Additionally, there seemed to be a disconnect between the servers and bartenders. At one point, our table ordered a round of drinks and had to wait 15 minutes to receive them. I wish I were exaggerating! For reference, we came at around 4:30 on a Saturday evening and left at around 6:30. All the staff was extremely nice, but I think they still have some kinks to work through in order to make this a full 5 star experience.   All in all, the food is truly phenomenal and worth the accolades it's received! However, the quality of service always plays a major role for me when it comes to getting the full experience at a restaurant. I'm hoping that as the weeks go on the service improves a bit, and I can return to Pork and Beans and give it the five stars I think it ultimately deserves!",

The appetizer was the pork belly potato skins. You get 3 skins with a pretty big piece of pork belly on each, tons of sour cream, butter, chives, and cheese. These were really good but the potato needed cooked a little longer as they were still kind of hard.  The sandwiches were the brisket grilled cheese, and the fried chicken. Sandwiches come with kettle chips which were delightfully sweet with a little spice. The brisket grilled cheese was really ooey gooey with a ton of long strips of brisket. Very rich and kind of too much cheese as you could just barely taste the meat. The fried chicken was very good, but it was suppose to be spicy and wasn't.  We ordered a beer on tap, and a mead spritzer. Beer came in a can shaped glass which was fun. The spritzer was dry and refreshing but not my favorite.  Overall I think this is a place for dinner, not lunch. It's very good, and their sauces are yummy.",

    "text": "The anticipation was so worth the wait and pork and beans did not fail to amaze me. A friend and I stopped in on a Friday after work right as they opened. A small line started to form but nothing crazy. I don't think word has gotten around that it's officially open so I think we lucked out. This place is going to end up like Tako with lines every weekend and reservations 3 weeks out.  Literally everything about this place is spot on. Everything looks like it flows together and for a second you forget you are in a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Everything down to the employees flannel attire and the pork and beans cans for your check was so perfect.  My friend and I both got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac n cheese to share. The pulled pork sandwich is topped with house made pickles and fried jalapenos. A very interesting combination but it went together perfectly. The jalapenos weren't too overpowering to take away from the flavor of the meat. They have 4 sauces at the tables to choose from: a classic BBQ, a tangy mustard, hot sauce, and a seasonal BBQ sauce that tastes a little tangier then the classic. The Mac n cheese was also out of this world. It tasted like they smothered the smoke queso all over those shells. I also got one of the featured drinks with my meal. The easy pickens which was a frozen bourbon apple cider drink. I wish I could have stayed a few more hours to enjoy some more!  All in all, you all need to get to pork and beans ASAP. It is well worth the long wait. I'm already debating when I can go back again!",

    "text": "Was very excited to try this place after hearing it was finally open! Made reservations and since there were only two of us, they seated us at one of the long tables. I will admit, it is not ideal since you have other people next to you on each side so conversation can be hard.    We ordered the dirty fries, spare ribs, kielbasa, mac & cheese, and loaded potato salad. The dirty fries were AMAZING! It was really crispy potato wedges with tender chunks of brisket, cheese sauce, green onions, and jalepenos. We literally did not want to stop eating it. I think the potato wedge is what it made it for me. They were just crispy fried potato goodness. It was also a hearty portion so definitely share it.   Our main dishes came out on a sharable platter which was fine. The spare ribs portion is 6 decent sized ribs. The ribs were super tender and cooked well. They also have four sauces you can choose from on the table: classic, seasonal, tangy mustard, and hot. The classic was great on the ribs. The kielbasa was a little charred so I just put some bbq sauce on it. The meat also came with pickled onions, cabbage, and rolls.   But our favorite part were definitely the sides! The loaded potato salad was to die for with creamy chunks of potato, chunks of meat, and shredded cheddar cheese. The mac & cheese was also super rich and creamy shells with a crumbled topping.   Overall, it was a delicious meal and I know I will be back. The prices are reasonable and portions are huge. We both had leftovers to take!",

The space makes you feel like you're in a backyard at someone's barbecue - very laid back!   I came with a larger party with a reservation and it took a while to get our orders in since the place was packed. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to eat in, but I did get pulled pork and a small mac and cheese to go, which were ready in about 10 minutes.   The pulled pork came with all four sauces (classic, barbecue, tangy mustard, and seasonal) and two soft rolls. The mac and cheese was incredibly creamy and heavier on the bechamel sauce flavor - I really liked it. I also appreciated that the to-go container had air vents so that you don't end up with water on your food. Overall, a good experience. I'd like to go back to sit through a full meal, which I suspect would be a five-star experience!",

I did a speedy search for reservations for 6 people and snagged a spot for our group after having some struggles deciding on a place to go for dinner. It was magical and I felt like technology helped save the day! We got a pretty fab meal out of it too.   The service was great - our server was on top of our drinks the whole night! I had visited a brewery earlier so I opted for Bulleit Rye on the rocks for one slow sipper to tide me over through the meal. What I didn't realize is that would end up being a rocks glass filled to the tippy top. I couldn't help but laugh when he set it down, but hey that's what vacation is for! Definitely got my money's worth on that one. Everyone else tried a bunch of beers. My bf was pumped to have some Auroch's gluten free beer too.   Since we had a decent sized group we decided a shared meal was in order and works well for the way the menu is structured. There's a list of different types of BBQ meats that come as platters and a list of sandwiches. The sandos are good for individual options and the platters naturally great for sharing. So we did just that - ribs, pulled pork, beer can chicken and brisket. The ribs were the shining star for sure - a must order! I couldn't stop going in for more, 2nd fave was the brisket. All the meats were super tender and well seasoned. The sides were amazing too - stand out was the broccoli salad (mayo based). The collard greens and Mac and cheese were solid too! We also tried the corn fritters, but they were a little to dry for me. I was saving room for protein! The platters come with a Martin's potato roll (arguably the best) along with pickles and cabbage and other accoutrements. They have a host of homemade BBQ sauces. The server was kind enough to share which ones went best with what so be sure to ask.   Overall, 3 sides and 4 meat platters was just enough to fill us up. We had an awesome time - the playlist was bumping some killer 90s tunes and the space was open and fun.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife for dinner.  We were downtown for the evening looking for a place to eat whenever I noticed that I had Pork & Beans bookmarked and so we decided to give it a try.  We made reservations for 6:30 via the Yelp app and tried to waste some time but didn't do a good job of it and arrived at the restaurant at 6:10.  Thankfully they weren't busy and we were able to immediately get a table.  Pork and beans has an interesting look to it as there is a bar area in the front with a number of high top tables where we sat.  Then behind that is the dining room which is separated from the bar by a chain \"cage\" with barbed wire on top.  It's not as menacing sounding as it seems but looks odd whenever you get a glance of it.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split a bunch of meats which we often do at BBQ places.  We ended up going with the pulled pork, pastrami pork belly and turkey for meats and then Mac and cheese and a beet salad as sides.  Our order ended up taking a while to come out which was explained away by the fact that a huge table was being served before us.  Since I worked in the restaurant industry at one point I understood how that went and my wife and I weren't in a hurry anyways.  Once it finally did make it to the table the first meat that I ended up trying was the pastrami Pork belly.  It was super tender and pretty much melted in your mouth while having a nice pastrami spice blend on it.  The next meat that I tried ended up being the turkey.  While I thought it was flavorful including having a hint of smoke, I also thought it was dry.  Oddly my wife seemed to think it was tender and moist.  Were we eating the same thing?  Haha.  Last but not least for the meats was the pulled pork which was cooked nicely and also had the smoky flavor to it.  In addition to trying all the meats plain I also tried them all with each of the four BBQ sauces that were on the table: classic, hot, tangy mustard and a seasonal.  What was surprising about the sauces was that they were fairly viscous.  Still they were all good with my favorites of the bunch being the sweet classic and also the tangy mustard.  After all I am a sucker for a good Carolina mustard based BBQ.  Surprisingly with all that I just said it wasn't the meats or the BBQ sauces that were the star of our meals and instead it was the sides.  Our beat salad had an amazing dressing on it (possibly a caramel vinaigrette?) that gave the beets some richness while also adding some acidity.  Not to be beaten the Mac and cheese was ooey gooey and quite decadent.  If you head to Pork and Beans it is the one item I would completely recommend as it was delicious.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While the space itself is hipster in what I found to be a weird sort of way, I really did enjoy the food that I had here, especially the Mac and cheese.",

AMAZING BBQ COMFORT FOOD!  *Service was super friendly helpful and quick.  *Restaurant is set up like a yarn, super original and fun.  *Even though the place is called pork & beans they have other types of meat. I tried the ribs (which is probably by far one of the best ribs I've had in my life, melts in your mouth), and smoked tri tip and it was finger licking.  *Appetizers are huge! I tried the dirty fries and couldn't finish them! So come hungry!   *Sides are delicious and very portions are generous, I tried the corn on the cob and it came with 3 corns with a little spicy breading on top (in my opinion, it was missing something creamy or buttery so I added some cheese from the dirty fries and it was PERFECT! lol ) but that's just my fat butt   So much food ! I couldn't finish it and I'm not a shy eater lol. Amazing experience overall, definitely a must if you are in town. I don't think my hometown (DC) has anything like it so it was a cool experience.",

The only thing I would say is that it is a bit too salty. But the flavor and tenderness of the meet was amazing. We had the potato skins with pork belly. Wow. Loaded fries that had goodness on top including jalapenos and brisket. For entrees we had the pork shank (my fav), brisket (husbands fav), jalapeno kielbasa sandwich topped with puller pork, goat cheese, and crispy fried onion (looked amazing) and a fried chicken sandwich that was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside. All of us were stuffed and we took home quite a bit of food. Generous portions and great libations. Highly recommend",

As an appetizer, we ordered dirty fries which were delicious! When it came to our meals, all of the meat was phenomenal... melted in your mouth and full of flavor!

Our waitress came over like we were inconveniencing her day  and did not introduce herself, went to order our drinks, my fiance and I gave her our ID's upon her request (both 24) and my brother (15) ordered a coke. She then asked my brother for his ID, which he doesn't carry a high school ID with him from NJ (didn't think that was unreasonable, nasty waitress thought otherwise) on a trip so she told us my fiance and I wouldn't be served alcohol. Both of us responded that he was 15... she then told us about this law in PA which she can't serve anyone at the table because someone was a minor without someone 25+ at the table, saying that there are audits being conducted (pretty sure she doesn't write the ages of guests on checks... but ok). Then she told us the coke machine wasn't working and we all had just water. I googled this law, it looks like NJ/NY/DE/PA all have similar laws. However it is up to the discretion of the sever if we are \"proper supervisors\" (which I guess according to this waitress we weren't). We were sober and quiet in our corner, she was free to scan my fiance's and my license if that was her issue. I work in Philly and live in NJ and have NEVER had this issue at a table with someone else being under 21 and no one over 25. Anyway, we order our meals and she is rude the entire time, including when I asked where the bathroom was, she got snippy with me and said \"well our kitchens over here so it's on the other side \" eye rolled and waved me off. I then witnessed her serve other tables with young crowds without carding everyone.... the food was good and unfortunately this rude, passive aggressive waitress ruined our experience and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want to be treated poorly. My advice, loose the attitude, she could have been much nicer about everything and acted like she cared about our experience, especially being in a role where customer service is important.",

They also offer delivery now, which is a huge plus from a restaurant of this caliber.   For me the menu really shines in terms of meat choices, since they offer the elusive tri-tip as well as sausage and the usual brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. They also do pastrami pork belly, which is a unique choice that works well in this case! The sides are varied and have been delicious from what I've tried, and they offer sandwiches and wraps with a vegan option available. Overall the bbq at Pork and Beans meets the high standards set by the other fantastic restaurants in this group, and I look forward to many more delicious meals here in the future.",

Our waitress didn't ask if we had been there before or if we were there for any special occasion, which would be fine if the food was good. We had the loaded fries which were soggy. The brisket on them was pretty good but came in 8 chunks as opposed to shredded throughout. We had the pork shoulder and the spare ribs. I was looking forward to meat that falls of the bone. These were crispy and and not tender. The pork shoulder was ok but I've had better. The hostess was pleasant though. I didn't like the sauces so that didn't help. They didn't have a sweeter sauce, which is just my preference. Our waitress didn't explain/ describe the sauces or how to order. It was fine. Just had higher expectations.  Update. Management reached out which I really appreciate. The restaurant seems to care about their customer service and does look at the reviews on here. My experience may have been atypical of this restaurant group.",

I'd been hesitant to review it because I was never sure how i felt: Drinks are good. Food was hit or miss. Service was hit or miss. Price point was okay.   My last visit: The drinks were awesome, they were the one thing that always was awesome. Never failed me, those drinks. I will say the decor is cute and welcoming. The mac n cheese is pretty good. Not runny or watery like some places. It truly feels like nana made this for you. The dirty fries are definitely enough to give you a heart attack, but they are good. They are meant for sharing, I could barely make a dent in these with my 2 friends. We got brisket. Tri Tip. Ribs.  It was all ok. It wasn't anything special and i definitely wouldn't go raving about it. I've had better, hell I may have made better once or twice, on accident (I'm a terrible cook). I wasn't mad at any of the food. I just wants drooling for more.  The pickles are a great addition. I love a good pickle. I could just eat pickles all day, I'd be happy.  I want to really like this place. the concept is cute and the decor is fun but.. it's lacking something that I just can't quite put my finger on.",

Our server was quick and attentive on orders and refills. Also very polite.  Sauces were good-4 were on the table. The Mac n cheese and beans were all very good as well. The atmosphere is nice and unique in Pittsburgh. It felt like a True BBQ place with a pig designed on a huge wall just from empty cans.

I ended up with the pulled pork platter and my friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and a sweet tea julep. The cocktail was good, although not quite worth the $10 price tag in our opinion.  My friend gave the fried chicken a thumbs up! She wasn't a big fan of the 4 table BBQ sauces with the chicken, but definitely paired the sauces with the side of chips. I thought the pulled pork platter was great! It came with two rolls, a pile of pickled vegetables, and a mound of tasty pulled pork. There was also room on the tray to put a bit of each of the sauces they had on the table. My favorite was the hot BBQ sauce, although all of them were really nice with the meat.   Service was pretty attentive and friendly. We were in and out easily within an hour! We didn't realize happy hour was only at the bar, but the deals seemed good, so we hope to go back for that sometime!",

One person had a Caesar salad with hard-boiled eggs and the anchovies buried on the bottom, so at first she thought they had mixed up and given her a Cobb salad. Either way, the kitchen was generous with the chicken. Two of us shared a half-rack of spare ribs and 2 sides. The waitress recommended 1 meat apiece, and she was right that there wasn't very much to share, but with a cup of broccoli salad and one of pork and beans, neither of us left feeling stuffed. My dining partner found the sauce sweeter than he would have liked, but I didn't mind. There didn't seem to be any use for the sauces on the table, and the potato rolls came without butter. The noise level is very high when it's busy, so it's just as well that they don't turn the sound on any of the tvs playing a variety of sports, whether over the bar, in the main seating area, or on the tvs in the single-table booths. The gender-segregated bathrooms share a sink through the wall (you might have to see it to understand it). I thought our waitress was a little brusque, especially after we only ordered one entree, but the kitchen was fast, and the cost seemed fair. We will go again.",

The cocktails we had were very nice & they also have a large draft beer selection with some good options.  All the food items we had were outstanding and definitely things I would return to eat again.  We tried the Korean fried ribs & jalapeno crab fritters for apps and had the pork shoulder sandwich & a BBQ plate with brisket, sausage and mac n cheese for entrees.

When I request a \"sandwich,\" as it is listed on the menu, I don't mean a heap of meat with a tiny unoriginal roll from a grocery store. For three \"sandwiches\" on a tray, the tiny bit of fixins was disappointing. Perhaps if the meat were great enough to stand on its own...  I got pork, but tried the brisket too. Sliced brisket is always a bummer, and other than that, I found it inedible. My friend didn't even want to take home what she didn't eat. It was super salty and fatty--and yeah, I get the trend toward fattier tender pork, but this made me gag.   I wouldn't recommend this place. Especially for the sad overpriced \"sandwich.\" Go get yourself some real barbecue that spends more energy on its flavor and quality than its image.",

We had eaten here before (and love it!) but didn't know they offered catering services. With relatively limited notice, P&B was more than accommodating. It was a 100% hassle free experience.   We picked up the food ourselves and everything was ready as soon as we arrived. The food was packaged up nicely, nothing spilled. We received more food than we could have imagined and everything tasted just as good as it does in the restaurant. What's more - they throw in rolls, bottles of sauces, and even towelettes.  We felt the price was very reasonable for the amount of food we received - $200 for 10 people (but probably would have fed more than 10, we had leftovers!).  My family and I were truly thrilled with the experience and wouldn't hesitate to have an event catered by Pork & Beans again.",

    "text": "This is our second time at Pork and Beans. First time ordered separate sandwiches.  Second time ordered 2 separate sandwiches and 4 (we thought) platters.  We were served our food and asked who ordered what platters.  My brother ordered the pork belly pastrami along with my husband and I ordered the brisket, along with my nephew. We both claimed our platters.   Platters were presented with 3 slider buns on each platter and about 5 slices of meat.  At no time did the waitress explain this was being served \"family style\" and we were to share the platter.      When we asked where were the other two missing platters, she explained that the two platters presented were to serve 4, not two.  Thankfully, I could not eat the amount of brisket on the plate so there was some left.  However, the pastrami pork belly was a disaster of pure fat.  By the time my brother tried to cut a small portion of edible pork from the all of the meat, there was nothing left of the platter for the other person to eat.  And really 3 slider buns for two people?  So cut one in half so we each get 1.5 buns!  We voiced our displeasure to our waitress and asked to see the manager.  The manager as well as our waitress were very gracious and apologized for the miscommunication.  They did adjust our bill.  We were pleased they did not try to \"justify\" what happened and owned up. We all felt that the pork belly was inedible and the chef should have realized that  We felt that a restaurant of their caliber and reputation should have either taken it off the menu that evening or warned that it was extremely fatty.  My brother was aware he was not getting a lean cut of meat and it would have some fat. Honestly, this was 99% fat.  And the only reason my brother ordered the pork belly is due to the fact that my husband ordered it the first time around and it was wonderful.  On a positive note, the beer and cocktails were great and the brisket was as good the second time as it was the first time I ordered it.  Just be aware of the platter situation if several people at the table order the same thing.",

To each their own, but I would never come here if a discount wasn't involved. oh by the way, reservations are sometimes honored sometimes not if they're busy and if you have a 5:00 res enjoy waiting forever and then some.",

The communal tables are reminiscent of a Munich beer hall and adds to the spirit of the place.  We both seemed to agree that our respective spouses would probably not want to go with us, but whatever.  The food was really good and the sides were perfect matches to the main meat dishes.  Service was perfect, as we were attending a concert later that evening, only minor complaint was beverage service was a little slow.  However, the place was crowded especially the bar as it was a Saturday night. A totally enjoyable evening,  great place to share a dinner with my son.",

It's all part of the experience, but consider asking for a hut for more privacy. Once you've settled in with your new BFFs, it's time for the meat fest. The special Korean BBQ pork ribs were larger than life, but not my favorite take on Korean BBQ. The classic pulled pork is spot on, and you can even make sliders with the rolls + accoutrements that come with. Score! The brisket, tri-tip and housemade kielbasa also got it going on. FYI, sides are critical to delay the inevitable meat sweats. The mac 'n cheese has some crispy and spice that is everything nice. Loaded potato salad is also solid. Burnt end beans and collard greens? Disappointing. And don't forget the homemade sauces. All equally good in their own right, but the hot was a bit too runny. Lastly, if you can't find a beer or cocktail you like...you've got issues. Service was professional and fairly timely even on a busy night. Next time we'll give the bar area a whirl.",

To begin with, you would think lessons had been learned from the complaints about Souza's establishments that adults paying $100+ for a meal don't want to sit in biergarden seating with strangers six inches away from them. But more importantly the food was at best average and at points just not good. We started with the frito pie, which was good but nothing special and I've had the same dish done equivalently well at back yard events. The spare ribs were fine but again nothing to write home about. The double down sandwich was fundamentally bad - bland in flavor and mushy in texture. I gave up after three bites. I know that high end BBQ is all the rage now, but truthfully both the atmosphere and the food feel like you're eating in a strip mall BBQ chain. Really just not good. We won't be back, which makes me sad because I've loved the work of the founders in their previous ventures and hoped this would live up to expectation.r",

Her response was \"if the drinks suck, at least the food is good\" and didn't do anything to rectify the situation, despite sending the drinks back all over halfway full.

It could've been slightly warmer, but so good otherwise. The dirty fries were not my favorite. A little greasy, and the potato tasted almost like it had been frozen. Very odd. The collard greens were the best I've had a a BBQ joint. Just like my southern mama makes. Baked beans were good as well. I like that they serve dinner rolls with the order too. It lets you stack everything nice and high for a great sandwich. The seating is odd. There are communal tables and no hooks for coats or purses. We were there early, so we didn't have to share a little able though. Also, there are only stools, so not even a chair back to hang on. Then, let's talk about the community sink in the bathroom. Half of the sink is in the ladies room, and half in the men's room. I thought it was a mirror at first, and had to look twice. It's a little uncomfortable, as it's very open. Overall, I recommend the place though. The food is top notch.",

The mac and cheese was my second favorite in the city, but still excellent. It was on the creamier side, so if that is what you like, you will love it.  The broccoli salad was the only food that was only so-so.  I would have picked something else instead.  Probably should have gotten the beans!  My friend got one of the Leona's ice cream sandwiches for dessert.  They just put it on a plate wrapped, no other presentation or anything.  You can probably skip this next time and just go buy your own Leona's somewhere else for cheaper.  The only other gripe was the fact that we were sat a large communal table.  I'm sorry, but I find this new fad annoying.  It's awkward for the people next to you.  It's hard to get in and out of the bench seating with people right next to you.  You have to crawl over the bench to put your feet in.  I wish they had more small tables next to one another.  Even if they were super close, it would still be better than this communal table BS.

We each did 1/2lb of brisket and it was the perfect amount of fat - just enough to make it buttery and super flavorful. The brisket honestly tasted better without any of their house made sauces. They had 4 sauces - 2 were super watery, their classic wasn't nearly smokey / tangy enough, and their seasonal (butternut squash bbq) while creative, just missed the mark. We also ordered broccoli slaw which was the worst part of our meal - it was creamy and had big chunks of cheese and just not what we were expecting. Service was a tad slow for lunch but overall very friendly. I'd come back for the wings and the brisket again and again.",

From the food, to the extremely detailed interior design; this is more than just your average restaurant experience. Pork and Beans was everything I had hoped it would be and well worth the wait!   My coworker and I arrived a little before 4 (when they open) and noticed a few others standing outside as well. I was really eyeing up the bar; so many bottles, so many pretty pink bar stools and even a long table for standing room when the bar gets full. Now that is a nice touch! Lexi and I were seated at one of the 3 long picnic tables towards the back. Each table came equip with 4 different BBQ sauces (seasonal, tangy mustard, hot and classic). The seasonal was my favorite, because it was a little more thick compared to the others. The only thing that drove me a little nuts was these BBQ sauces were in glass bottles and it got a little messy at times. But that's what the roll of paper towels is for at each of the tables. No need to ask the waitress for silverware either when you have a giant bucket at your table! I can ramble about the interior all day, but let's talk about the food!   The prices are just what I expected and pretty average for BBQ. They have quite a bit of appetizers to choose from which is always a plus. I went with the pulled pork sandwich and it was huge! One thing is for certain and the same goes for tako, they know how to deliver flavor. The onions, fried jalapenos, pickles and cabbage topped on my pulled pork was the perfect combination. The sides do not come with your meal. They are $5 for a small and $10 for a large! My friend and I split a small mac and cheese and it was right up there with one of best mac and cheeses I have ever had. I am very eager to try the beef ribs and am already planning my next visit with my parents. The service was great, the food was great and if you are looking for a memorable dining experience, get to Pork and Beans!",

We went with friends and I was able to get a reservation reasonably easy (considering P&B is located in the theatre district nearby other restaurants owned by the same group). Our experience at P&B was good. The place is very casual. The decor inside is very laid back. I liked it a lot. As for the food, we all really liked the ribs--they were really meaty, moist and super flavorful. The sauce they were served with was perfect for me but if you wanted other sauces, they were available At the table.  Others in the group had the brisket toasted cheese with caramelized onions. They loved that sandwich!  Our final food item was the brisket. To me is was a little dry, but it definitely tasted good. They serve decent food portions here. Recommend splitting a play or two as there is a lot of food!  I'd definitely go back, and hopefully will soon",

I've spent several years in Texas and my boyfriend is a native; this food is as good as any barbecue you'll find there. Wow actually I'm going to say it may even be better. The beef brisket sandwich literally melts in your mouth the way it should. Topped with pickle and white onion. The Dirty Fries are breaded potato wedges topped with chunked brisket Cheese Whiz fresh jalapenos and onions. Those fries are a meal alone. Variety of BBQ sauces, my favorite being the Seasonal. The sweet taste of berries and tangy spice made for an exceptional sauce. Drank my PBR 40 right outta the paper bag. Our meal was ended with dessert from Leona's...pumpkin spice ice cream and shortbread sandwich. You guys I'm so full from this amazing meal that as I type this I swear my stomach is resting on my lap. The drink and beer menu is extensive to say the least. An entire page dedicated to beers on tap. My head is spinning from a delightful evening. I'm like a stuffed pig up in here!!! Also we were personally greeted by Tolga which was impressive. An owner taking the time out to stop by not once but twice is a plus. Our server was cute, sweet, bubbly and informative.",

One of our party's food came but 40 min later the other three dinners hadn't arrived. We had asked a couple times about the delay and said it would be a couple minutes. After 45 min we decided to just pay for the four drink and one appetizer that we had and leave...then the bartender told us the order hadn't made it in. No apologies or offer to comp anything. Left very disappointed at the indifference and lack of customer service by the bartender and manager. Won't go back.",

So the inside of the restaurant is done up the right way for the food their serving.   So we ordered the devil eggs of the day and they were every bit of delicious. The bacon sprinkled with the fresh piece of dill was an awesome finish.   For our main course we order the dirty fries, tri-tip, ma n cheese, and baked beans. Foremost, get items to share the amount of food served is plenty and you can try more things. The tri-tip was cooked to perfection and was so delicious. The mac n cheese was the reason I didn't give them 5 stars. It had a wonderful look and consistency however, it was bland and lacked any real flavor. The baked beans were absolutely amazing and delicious. It was by far the best part of the meal. The dirty fries were expecting great. The size of the wedges were nice and the flavor profile was amazing.   All in all good eating.",

    "text": "We visited on a Thursday night before The Who concert so it was pretty early in the evening and not very busy.  We started with the crab fritters that were fantastic but the presentation was a little odd as they were all piled up together in the corner of pretty large plate.  Given it is a very casual place this struck me as a bit odd.  We got two meats - spare ribs and brisket and two sides - mac and cheese and baked beans.  The spare ribs were fantastic with lots of char and very meaty!  The brisket as also very good - tender with lots of flavor although not the best that I've had elsewhere.  Brisket is a hard thing to make well as Pork and Beans definitely did a good job with it.   The sides were sort of a miss for me.   The mac and cheese was lukewarm and the breadcrumbs on top tasted oddly sweet to me.  The portion was pretty small too considering it was meant to be shared.  The baked beans were the real oddity though.  It was a mix of different kinds of beans with some meat (brisket I think?) and a fairly spicy sauce.  The different kinds of beans gave the dish a strange texture that wasn't bad but wasn't exactly good either.   They were ok but left me wishing we'd made a different choice.  The dish also include pickles that were awesome!  I could have eaten an entire plate of them!   They referred to them as \"half sour\" but they really reminded me of eating my grandma's pickles that were freshly made but not yet canned for the winter!  As much cucumber-like as they were pickle-like I loved them!",

I probably set the bar a little too high being from Dallas and all, but the BBQ brisket here was pretty good! My wife and I shared a sandwich and got an order of fries on the side. We tried each of the signature sauces and found one that we liked (I think it was mustard based) and a few that were just meh. While the fries were fresh they were a little too salty for our us.    The sandwich was one-of-a-kind as it had both pickles and mustard with the brisket which was a first for both of us.   Ambiance is lively and sporty and the wait staff were attentive. Would like to come back soon and try more of the menu.",

The meal came with a homemade potato roll and pickled veggies. We chose the tri-trip and the pork belly and got the loaded potato salad and Mac and cheese to compliment our meats. The tri-tip was juicy and the bark and burnt ends were sublime. The pork belly had a nice smoky flavor. The loaded potato salad wasn't too creamy and even had some broccoli! The Mac and cheese was the perfect consistency, not too cheesy and the noodles were al dente. Deelish!",

I skipped the bun after a bit and continued with a fork. Chips were tasty and well seasoned. The Korean Pulled Pork Sandwich was a different take on most pulled pork sandwiches and I enjoyed the spiciness of the added kimchi.",

Not sure if they were bored or just not in the mood. Either way, we were taken to our seats immediately.  The restaurant seems a lot bigger than it looks. I thought there might be a few tables but I was wrong. Which is good, I'm not a fan of claustrophobic type restaurants that are usually busy. Everything was clean and in order.  We decided on wings, brisket, pork shoulder and Mac n Cheese.  The wings were just okay. I forgot the type of flavor but the sauce could have been a tad hotter.   The brisket and pork shoulder were the superstars of the meal. They both were amazing in their own way. I didn't even try the sauce that they have on the table until I was half way done. That's how good the meat is! Out of the 4 sauces, the original was the best.   The Mac n cheese was really good as well. Cream yet somewhat thick and the pasta was great too.   We will be making another trip sometime soon!",

They have the silverware set in coffee cans and water in glass bottles.  The service was good and they have the oldies spinning on the radio.  They have a nice draft list and some good menu options, not too overwhelming.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich.  It was a fried breast with coleslaw on top of a toasted bun.( I skipped the cheese) The chicken breast was juicy and the bread was soft.  I also get the honey sauce on the side, so it doesn't make the bread to soggy.  The best combinations of flavors are in this sandwich.    My husband ordered nachos and added grilled chicken on top.  The chicken was pickle brined which made the chicken flavorful.  He enjoyed them even though he said it had a lot of beans.  For dessert we split a icecream sandwich with a peanut butter cookie and chocolate icecream.  It was easy to split and we  both enjoyed it!",

It could be just that this isn't my preferred style but the flavor of all of the sauces were so tangy and almost sour. There were 4 different sauces and I didn't like any of them. They used the same tangy style in the beans as well and I couldn't eat them. I ended up taking my pulled pork home in a to go container and using my store bought BBQ sauce. It was so much better. On top of the disappointing flavors they served it on a separated tray which made me feel like I was eating a middle school lunch.   I enjoyed the Mac and cheese side and the roll was ok. The slaw salad added some good flavor contrast.",

All very tasty. Especially we love the spicy and tasty baked beans.  Although a bit overpriced compared with a similarly good Texan bbq place, we enjoyed our time and meal and I won't hesitate to recommend this place to my lovely Yelp audience.",

Ordered this for delivery on a Friday night and it came right on time. We got the pork & beans entree, tri-tip, and pork belly with additional sides of Mac and cheese, fully loaded potato salad, and collard greens.  Overall, I was very happy with my choices. The meat was perfectly cooked, the sides were very filling and flavorful. I really enjoyed everything about the pork and beans - great ham and bean stew (it is very rich) and the bread was fantastic. Literally no complaints at all. The sauces were all amazing too. As someone who often finds BBQ sauces too sweet, I was so impressed that they gave me so many options with different flavors and heats to try.   You really don't need to order a lot to get full - everything was very rich and heavy. I passed out in a deep food coma pretty quickly.",

The Dirty Fries are a MUST HAVE. Everything on them was so rich, but the brisket was the best part. It felt like we ate so much of it before our entrees arrived and it looked like we barely made a dent. As for our entrees, we shared a blue plate. It was a little expensive, given that there wasn't as much food on it as we anticipated. However, everything was still tasty and cooked well. I probably wouldn't order the blue plate again given that there wasn't a lot of food. But I would definitely pay another visit to Pork & Beans!",

He was slow, and seemed like he would rather hang out at the bar talking to the bartender than service our table. We had four people in our group who were in from out of town, and were excited to try out the restaurant scene in Pittsburgh. I had been to Pork and Beans before and felt it would be a great choice. Unfortunately the lack of service provided a lack luster experience than even the perfect seasoning on the tri tip could not overcome. It'll be a hot minute before I return, that's for sure.",

    "text": "So wanted to love this place as I really enjoy Meat & Potatoes, but it fell short. My hope is that it was just an off night as I have heard such great things about this place.  We were there promptly for our reservation and were seated right away.  We ordered drinks and food when our server came over.  It took a half hour to get drinks.  This had me a little concerned because we had to be at the theater at a certain time.  Our appetizers didn't come until we had been seated for 45 minutes.  We ordered dirty fries and the coffee rubbed wings.  The wings were very tasty and has an unusual flavor.  The green curry side sauce went perfectly with the wings.  The dirty fries were tasty but very filling.  And I wish there had been more meat on the dirty fries.  Right after our appetizers came our server came by and told us they were out of ribs for one of our meals.  Before we adjusted our order I reminded him we only had 25 minutes before we absolutely had to be out the door and race to the theater and was that doable.  He says everything was ready in the back and should be coming right out. So we adjusted our orders for the ribs and had him bring us the bill so we were ready to go as soon as we ate.  Our food finally made it to the table with 10 minutes left before we had to be out the door.  Thankfully we are fast eaters.  We all had a version of the blue plate special since it allowed us to sample a few different things.  I had pulled pork, pastrami pork belly, Mac and cheese, and loaded potato salad.  The pulled pork was good but nothing spectacular.  I was expecting the pastrami pork belly to have the pastrami flavoring that I love but I didn't taste it.  I loved the Mac and cheese, it was super cheesy and had a great bread crumbs crust on top.  The loaded potato salad turned out not to be what I thought it would be either.  I assumed it would be similar to a loaded potato; so potato, cheese, bacon, sour cream.  I think it had all that but I took a big bite and it also had broccoli in it.  I am not a fan of broccoli so wasn't expecting or wanting it in my potato salad.  In defense of Pork & Beans there weren't descriptions under the meats and sides so I used my own assumptions when ordered pastrami pork belly and loaded potato salad.  Overall this meal was an unexpected disappointment.  Usually I love these restaurants and especially restaurants in the theater district know how to push food out, but this time it just didn't work out.",

    "text": "The latest and greatest installment in the Richard DeShantz restaurant group's campaign to Make Downtown Pittsburgh Great Again. I love M&P, tako, and Butcher & the Rye. But since I am downright obsessed with barbeque, Pork and Beans is my new favorite restaurant in growing culinary empire.  My partner and I had the brisket and the spare ribs. Both were tasty, but the spare ribs were To. Die. For. Seriously! A ribs lover's heaven.  We also tried the Cobb salad, which was all good except the fried chicken, which had really bland fried breading. I don't know if this was a fluke, but I don't think I'll be trying the full fried chicken dish on the basis of this!  There were four sauces for us to choose from. My favorites were the seasonal (kind of fruity, tangy when we were there in December) and the spicy.  The draft list is extensive, with nods to both local and seasonal brews. It's not a list for hop-heads though; of the ~30 beers on tap, only two or three of them were IPAs/Imperial IPAs. Personally I would love to see at least a few more IPAs available, but perhaps it's a seasonal thing and we can expect a bigger selection in warmer weather.  The cocktails were tasty. My partner had an expertly crafted Manhattan. I had the Euge, which was pretty unique combination of spicy, nutty, chocolatey, minty and citrus. I enjoyed it for the novelty and felt like I was in Pirates of the Caribbean. Next time will probably opt for a more classic cocktail though.  It doesn't seem like it's really worth it to make advance reservations, unless you can specifically request a booth style table. They will seat you at a communal table if that's what's available, and there's not a lot of elbow room at those tables. We had a reservation but were able to sit down earlier at the bar, where you can seat yourself on a first-come basis.  I can't wait to come back and try all the tasty meats!",

Don't get weirded out by pimento cheese on the menu.  It was awesome.  Leona's ice cream sanwiches.  Mac and cheese.  G_G_G_Great.  (when your food comes, use everything on your tray, pickled items, meat, bread, make a sandwich add a pickle.  Sidenote:  the jalapenos are no joke)  We walked in on a Tuesday at around 4:30 and got a seat at the bar.  The other tables are cafeteria style and you sit very close to your friendly strangers.  They do have booths, if you would like your privacy.  By 5:30, ON A TUESDAY, that place was bumpin, from the business men to the foodie hipsters.  A super diverse crowd.     A little pricey, but worth the atmosphere and buzz.",

    "text": "We were able to get an early reservation on a Tuesday evening, a few weeks ago. With it being our first visit, and being pretty unsure about the communal tables that I had read about in other  reviews, we specifically requested a booth if available. I really appreciated the text that I received from the host confirming that we would be seated in a booth, a few days before the reservation.  As for our experience at the restaurant--it was absolutely fantastic. Our waitress was very helpful in offering many suggestions while we tried to navigate their extensive beer list. Yet, she didn't pressure us into making decisions hastily and gave us plenty of time to comb through our many options. The food was amazing--we tried the deviled eggs of the day (crab), dirty fries, brisket, pork belly, mac n' cheese, loaded potato salad, and marinated cucumber salad. My girlfriend immediately said, \"We have to come back here, again!\" after only a few bites of the appetizers--she's never that quick to make such a emphatic judgement on a new restaurant. We decided to play it safe and just stick to the original BBQ sauce, but it was one of the best sauces I've had--and I can be quite the BBQ snob when it comes to any place but my own kitchen.  I read other reviews that said the portions were small and that the value for the price was a little bit iffy, but I definitely disagree. Sure, our bill for two was north of $80, but we left with a ton of leftovers and were very satisfied with the meal and experience--quality isn't cheap! We both would highly recommend this to anyone that loves well executed BBQ.",

While I will never discount the beauty that is the Korean taco at Tako or the deliciously authenticity of La Palapas but I am so happy to not be writing about a taco place! I need some variety!!!  Pork and Beans has barbecue and  darn good barbecue at that!!! I went with my coworker and his wife the other night. I wasn't very hungry but had to get something! I ordered a sausage of the day. They had a few but I ordered the kielbasa. I also couldn't help but order the mac n' cheese as well because I'm not a crazy person (debatable, I'm sure).  During the summer, we do a lot of cooking out/pot luck style dinners with friends and summer sausages are a stable for us. So a quality sausage is always something I keep an eye out for. This Kielbasa was sooo good, I really wish they would operate as a butcher shop as well. The mac n' cheese was creamy and satisfying. Some dislike a rich mac...not this girl. I have no fear of a heavy/cheesy/luscious meal! I also had the pleasure of trying the tri-tip and was not disappointed! Tender and flavorful, as expected!   I love this place for so many reasons! The vibe is great! The food is wonderful! I also am just so please to have a place serve comfort food without the fuss. i date a very picky eater and I love that he can enjoy food there, as I enjoy the ambiance and craft cocktails!!!",

We were seated in the MIDDLE of a long picnic bench table across from each other. Seriously? And I made reservations way in advance, which I guess didn't mean anything.. and there was empty tables that were empty the entire time we were there.  I highly recommend going with a party of 4 and requesting a private table on the side of the restaurant.  I mean several people were really pissed off in there over the seating.  Also, its winter, and they have no coat hooks, anywhere.  Not cool.",

    "text": "I am indifferent about Pork and Beans.  I have been anxiously awaiting for them to open.  Even had reservations in May, to get called the week before to get cancelled and told to try a month later.  So - 5 months later when they finally opened we were happy to get reservations within a week of them opening.  Let me put a disclosure - I am not a huge BBQ person.  It's not that I dislike it - it is just not my favorite.  But I definitely wanted to give Pork and Beans a chance.  My preference would be to give them 3.8ish stars.  Here is my reasoning behind that:  1.  Communal seating.  I get it's a casual joint.  I get that they want to feed the people.  But come on!  One side was benches - so if you are in a skirt - beware!  And there is not much room to move.  2.  The placement of the silverware and BBQ sauces.  We were seated in the middle - so we had a couple on each side of us.  Had one party not left - we would have had to reach over them to get to the BBQ sauce.  While they had left - we got some and our silverware.  But at no point could we have gotten more.  The papertowels, silverware, and BBQ sauce was all blocked by a group.  Either less people per table or more accessibility to the items would be ideal.  3.  The containers the BBQ sauces are in.  First let me say - the BBQ sauces were awesome!  I loved the mustardy and seasonal ones.  However - sanitary wise - squirt bottles would be so much better.  I LOVE the bottles they are in - but when I saw a gentleman across the table from me lick his fingers, open a bottle, get sauce on his fingers, lick his fingers again.  I was done.    4.  The music was far too loud.  I love music in a restaurant. But, when the restaurant is packed, and you can still hear every single word that's playing and can't carry on a conversation with the person across the table from you - that's an issue.    I know - I am by no means - someone who could even fathom running a restaurant.  And I am also by no means saying this is not a good restaurant.  It is - the food - that I never got to - was fantastic!  I know I sound like this is a negative review - but it isn't.  It's a new restaurant working out it's kinks.  When (not if - WHEN) i got back - I will happily update my review.   I would like to give them another shot.  However, I'd try to go with 4 people and request a booth.  Even if it meant waiting longer for reservations.  The decor is pretty awesome.  I love the interior - just not the communal tables :)  Do I think you should check out Pork and Beans?  Absolutely.",

The bar is really neat with the sink taps, I loved the design. We had a 7pm reservation Saturday and they let us know they were running a little behind. So, we grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited. The bartenders were phenomenal, they greeted us right away and introduced themselves. They had 1911 Raspberry Cider on tap, so I was a happy camper. We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation.  There are two types of tables in the dining area; booths along one wall and large dining tables that you share with other patrons. We were seated at one of the long tables in between two other parties. At first, I was bummed, but you really don't feel like other people are seated next to you. They do a great job of using the condiments and things as a sort of \"barrier\" between groups. I think a booth would still be ideal though.  I thought they had a lot of great options for food. More so than some of their other restaurants. Everything appeared to be fairly priced (maybe the sides are a little pricey at $7 a pop). I ordered the catfish sliders as my meal and mac-and-cheese. The food was so good! I could eat those catfish sliders regularly.   The only bad part of my meal was the service during dinner. We went from the phenomenal bartenders, to a pretty lame waiter. He wasn't personable at all and never offered to refill our drinks from the bar. In fact, when my brother finished his beer he came over and removed his glass from the table, without saying anything. I had to ask for another beer, and he asked me for my I.D. to get a new one (after I'd already had two at the bar?). But, again he never offered to grab one for anyone else even though their glasses were empty.",

I know we're north of the Mason-Dixon Line, but how can you run a BBQ place and not have sweet tea? Yes, I do realize I can add sugar to my unsweetened tea, but even after mixing it, the sugar doesn't dissolve appropriately. Yes, I realize I'm being petty, but offer sweet tea at a BBQ place even if you're in the north.   It has been over a year since I've been here, so maybe they've since added sweet tea. If they have, I would gladly change my rating. Until then, I can't legitimately take a BBQ place seriously without it.",

I do not feel comfortable having others basically sitting on my lap listening to my conversation. The decor, from the very \"open concept\" bathroom to the caged in feel, was not for me.  The food on the other hand was quite good. The brisket was probably one of the best I've ever had, and the portions seemed generous for the price. The sauce was just okay though. I am partial to a Kansas City style sweet and thick sauce over a more vinegar based sauce; which I found Pork and Beans to have. Not terrible, just not one of my favorites. I would go back for the brisket but make sure to reserve a private booth.",

    "text": "This place is a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. I went with friends on a Saturday night, we made reservations, but it didn't seem grossly overcrowded when we got there at 7. The drinks were really cool, and they seemed to have a decent beer selection as well. I got the 1/2 lb of brisket, and I was so happy I did. They give you buns and toppings to make sandwiches and there was enough for me to take home which is always a treat. The mac and cheese was great!   I will say that the service was a little disappointing. The waitress we had was very nice, but didn't really tell us too much about the menu. I thought this was odd, considering this is a new restaurant so it should have been a safe assumption we may not have been there before. As I said I got the brisket, but I didn't know it would be coming with topping and sides to make a sandwich. It was a pleasant surprise for sure, but should it have been a surprise? There are sauces on each table, but we were never told what any of them were.  I'm hoping they work out those kinks as the time passes, because this is a great new spot. I will definitely go again.",

    "text": "Came in for HH without much of an appetite, but decided to get a pulled pork slider because, well, pork is in the name. Maybe it's worth it?  It suuuuuper was. Wow. Just one lil slider prompted me to leave this review. The Korean kimchi pulled pork slider had the perfect bouquet of flavors and spiciness. The lukewarm temperature took some adjusting to; bartender said the pulled pork is slow-cooked overnight so is just barely reheated so not to dry out the meat. I'll buy that! Kimchi was crunchy and refreshing, without being overly vinegary.   I lived in NC for half a decade and got to know GOOD pulled pork barbecue. I would venture to say this is the only thing in Pittsburgh that can compete with down-home, western NC-style bbq.",

    "text": "After a hellish July, Matt and I needed a date night. We decided the place to go was Pork & Beans! We wanted something different, so we ubered downtown and hit up this gem on a Saturday night.   We started of with the crab fritters and pork rinds. The crab fritters were AMAZING. There was a pepper oil on them and they were on top of some amazing golden bbq sauce/1,000 island dressing kinda mashup. We couldn't eat them fast enough. I didn't even get a picture, that's how fast they were gone. They were delicious. The pork rinds left a little to be desired, however. The \"dip\" that comes with them is cold and hard and just leaves a strange taste in your mouth. Half of the rinds were too hard to eat, so we gave up and waited for our dinners.   I got the Three Little Pigs, and Matt got Brisket with collard greens. My sandwich was perfect (the half that I could eat, it was huge!) One of the meats was fried on the sandwich and it had an amazing crunch. Everything worked so well together. Matt's brisket fell apart with a fork. And his collard greens actually held up to their sauce, and had good texture.   The service was great. Our waitress was training a new waiter and they were really attentive making sure we had everything we needed.   The only thing that I didn't really care for was the group style dining arrangement. It wasn't super busy when we got there, but it would be awkward eating ribs or something messy right next to a total stranger.   I hope we can make it back here soon to try some of their daily specials. Matt really wanted the Thursday Special (prime rib) but it was Saturday. He will survive.   Happy Eating!",

There are lots of savory food paired with sweet, salty and spice. Everything I've tried is delicious.   The food expresses much more than your standard BBQ, and you will find that reflected in the price.  The draft list is extensive, although they don't seem to serve a Porter, which would go quite well with the food.   The service is very attentive, and my server was knowledgeable about the menu.  I was surprised to see a bridal couple drop and ask if they could take photos in the booths in the back. They love the rustic construction, perhaps you can picture yourself there, too?",

A friend and I stopped here for lunch and surprisingly, there wasn't many people in the restaurant. We were able to order and get our food within 10 minutes. I was really impressed how they have a seasonal sauce- I unfortunately did not try it because I had enough sauce on my ribs. I appreciate how there was a variety to choose from. I can't stop thinking about the ribs!! The sauce was the perfect amount of smoky and sweet. The flavor penetrated the meat and left me wanting more.   I'm a fan of burnt ends and beans however, I was a little disappointed with them here. I didn't like the flavor because they weren't that sweet. But that's just a matter of preference, my friend said they were really good.   I'd recommend this place if you are in downtown Pittsburgh, the environment is really great and service is efficient. I really like all the detail that went into this cool restaurant. There's even a pig trough in the restrooms for the sink- how fun!",

Fries decent, almost extra crispy for those that may like them that way, but not really to my liking, but made tolerable by soaking them in the tasty sauces.  Menu seems designed to order dishes to be shared, so probably not the best place if you're dining alone as I was in this visit.    Prices on the sides seemed high but most other items seemed reasonably priced.  My server was very nice, helpful and checked often if all was OK or if I needed anything else, so that's a plus too.

Pork and Beans has all the delicious BBQ favorites you can ask for, from ribs to brisket, pork shoulder, and sides such as Mac and cheese and the eponymous pork and beans.  You can tell the place really cares about the meat they use, as every piece is great quality and cooked nicely. I wasn't a super big fan of the ribs---thought they could've been roasted longer bc they were not tender enough, but the brisket was amazing, seasoned generously and very easy to eat through.  I thought their drinks list could have more wine, considering how much meat there is and opportunity for fun drink meat pairings. There is a lot of beer instead, which fits the ambiance, but doesn't allow for a pairing like a deep red with brisket.  I really wish the daily specials could be offered everyday (prime rib!) but I guess I'll have to come back on the right day to try it out.",

I thought I had a plan for our first night and that got thrown out the window so I needed a place close to our hotel that would quickly fill our bellies with good food.   After some searching on Yelp we decided on Pork & Beans. We walked over from out hotel and were nervous when we walked in the door because the place was packed...however it was just the front area around the bar as there was a corporate event there. We were seated immediately along the back wall.   I have to say that I wasn't overwhelmed by the options on the menu...more specifically that they don't do a combo for the 'meats'...so you can't get something like ribs and pulled pork as a serving for one. Otherwise, the menu has lots to offer.   We decided to start with the wings and they were outstanding!  Great smoky flavor and a nice flavored hot sauce. My son ended up ordering the fried chicken special (1/2 a fried chicken, fries, and two cheddar jalapeno biscuits), Wifey got the Brisket sandwich (brisket, pickles, some kind of aioli on a bun with a side of made onsite bbq chips) and I got the Ribs and beans. Wifey also ordered the Hitchhiker, Bane of Existence IPA and I got the Victory golden monkey.   The chicken was outstanding though my son didn't love the biscuits. Wifey absolutely loved the actual brisket, but the roll was too big and dry for the sandwich-so she ended up deconstructing the sandwich.  My ribs were excellent with a delicious smokiness and they were cooked perfectly. I didn't even bother putting in any sauce...the flavor stood out on its own. I actually didn't like my beans-they were a miss for me...needed something.   Other than the beans this was a pretty good meal. Good food, great service, fun ambiance great beer selection...that's a great combination!",

It is now one of the foods I will recommend when anyone asks me where to eat in Pittsburgh.  The brisket itself is perfect and smoky and tender. The plating is simple; you get the brisket, a couple of small buns, and house pickles. Despite being a fan of extravagant and artful plating, trust me when I say this arrangement is perfect. You have everything you need, and the brisket is allowed to shine.  I also split an order of Jalepeno Crab Fritters with a friend. These too were really good.  There's a solid chance I'll go back next time I have family or friends in town. This place is worth sharing!",

The hostess made an odd comment that felt like we were an inconvenience even though there was one other table seated in the entire restaurant. Then, our waitress followed suit when she approached us immediately asking if we were ready to order. When we said we needed time, she just walked away irritatedly. She soon came back and when I asked if we could order drinks, she made another rude comment. I immediately had a bad taste in my mouth.   I will say that this is not my style restaurant, but I was with family and I didn't choose. The people I was with really liked the food, but I didn't like that everything has a Smokey taste and the menu lacked any variety or healthy options. I get it, it's in the name, but still, a few choices wouldn't hurt!   I ordered the cheddar jalepeno kielbasa which was very good but huge! I only ate half. The beans were okay. What I did love was the homemade chips.   I'm not likely to head back here any time soon, but I hope the service was just a fluke and if you are a meat-monger, this may be the place for you!",

    "text": "So I came here with a friend who had eaten here before and is a fan. I had never been here and frankly wasn't super hungry, so I can't really attest to how much of the food is. I will post my basic impressions though, if you might find them useful:  1) This is not your typical BBQ place. There's no country music playing, there are not Texas flags mounted on the wall, there's no one wearing jeans or 10-gallon hats. If you took the bottles of BBQ sauce off the tables, you'd think it was any kind of moderately upscale restaurant you'd find in any major city in America. They could have served Asian fusion for all you would know.  2) The food was good. We shared the loaded fries, which had chunks of BBQ in it. You can order meat on its own or in a specialty sandwich with all kinds of different toppings and sauces and such on it. So there were options that I did not explore.  3) The tap list was good. A mix of local and regional stuff, nothing too exotic.   4) Good service. I didn't have any issues with the server being slow or lacking enthusiasm for my asking for refills on my iced tea.  In all, I almost hate to rate the place 3 stars because I didn't order a whole lot of stuff and I went there only once. I'd rather give it an incomplete and go back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh. I'm giving it 3 stars mainly because it bills itself as a Texas-inspired BBQ and smokehouse restaurant but there wasn't much about it that felt all that...Texaslike. But still, everything we had was good, and you might like it more than I did.",

    "text": "We really liked this place. We sat at the bar, because the wait for regular tables was an hour, and the service was excellent. Casual/industrial but nice setting. Not too loud. Interesting fusion dishes, many with a kick, so ask your server if you need something mild/not spicy.   For example, we had the Korean bbq ribs appetizer and deviled eggs appetizer and both were good, but spicy. The deviled eggs are not your standard, so be ready for something different, more with a pickle-type flavor, and a kick at the end. The Korean bbq was really good, also had a kick that built up. The crab fritters by then tasted very mild, comparatively, but my companion said they also had a kick.   We also got the brisket platter and it was very good and not spicy at all.   We were very pleased overall with the fare, drinks, and service. Thank you!",

    "text": "The BBQ at this place is amazing, and not just for the Cultural District in Pittsburgh; it's just good BBQ in general! They have all the staples of a great BBQ joint: a variety of sauces, large trays for all of your meat and sides, beans with burnt ends, baked Mac and cheese, and vinegar forward pickles.   I ordered the Jalapeno cheddar sausage which came in a giant roll topped with pulled pork and a (seemingly out of place) dollop of chevre. I thought that there were going to be too many flavors to battle for airtime but boy was I wrong. Everything went together well and nothing was overpowering. The chevre was a surprisingly perfect addition because the tartness cut through the fattiness of the meat. Everything was really delicious--the seasoned, homemade chips in particular, which came with everything.   My only issue with Pork and Beans was the service. When we arrived, our host made a comment that came off strange when we asked for a table for 5. Then, our server had no pleasantries when taking our order and we had a very awkward interaction when it came to asking for our drinks. When it comes to service I was not at all impressed. However, we may have just gotten a few duds?   Definitely come here for the BBQ, just don't expect to be coddled by the wait staff.",

They didn't seem annoyed and kindly sat us at a common table when we arrived. I ordered their blood orange mule which was very tasty. Cocktail prices were fair for a downtown Pittsburgh restaurant; around $10-12 per drink. They had a pretty good beer list, as well, with local breweries on tap which was nice to see.   The waitress said it was family style but still recommended 1 meat + 1 side per person, so that didn't exactly feel like family style to me. Just sharing among the table. We ended up ordering 2 meats and 3 sides, which was definitely enough food for us (though I'm a light eater, I must admit). We ordered the brisket and pork shoulder. The brisket was super yummy. I wasn't a huge fan of the pork shoulder. The sauces were on the table -- fun to try all of the different options. We ordered mac n cheese, baked beans and fries. We probably could've done without the fries but the mac n cheese and baked beans were delicious!!   Overall it was a nice evening out and reasonable bill. The atmosphere is fun and eclectic for downtown Pittsburgh.",

Nobody at my table would finish them. Mac and cheese was so so. The baked beans tasted like someone poured a whole bottle of liquid smoke in them. Again nobody would eat them.

    "text": "Ambiance: The saloon/miner town vibe seems like it was designed by the same people that did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride but it works. I liked the theme and enjoyed the music they played in the background. The volume was controlled although we came for lunch on a weekday so the place was nowhere near capacity. Service was friendly and efficient.  Food: I had the rib platter (not fried) which was uh-mazing. The ribs had a truly flavorful rub and must have been braised in their own juices because they were both incredibly juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender. The ribs easily held their own and didn't need sauce but trying the sauces is half the fun of BBQ. Of the 4 table sauces, the original was the most well-rounded and paired well with everything. The biggest complaint I had with the platter is that there was no option to order a half or full rack so you were stuck with a paltry 3 ribs. The potato roll was moist and soft but still just a roll and the pickled were sweet pickles which I don't care for. I ordered the mac and beans for my sides and both were good. The mac had the perfect creamy cheesy texture and wasn't a congealed mess like other places. The beans had a very smokey flavor and generous chunks of burnt ends in it but lacked some acid or sweetness to really bring everything together. My wife had the Korean pulled pork sandwich which was quite good as well. The pulled pork was moist and well-smoked. The kimchi-gochuchang sauce was also used judiciously and not overpowering. I was not a fan of the potato chips as they had a slightly styrofoam texture but my wife loved them.  Overall we had a very good experience at Pork and Beans and would gladly come back if it weren't such a pain to park here. The place could benefit from some more flexibility by letting people order bbq meats a la cart or offering combo plates so you can sample everything but I guess it's incentive to come back. Definitely worth checking this place out if you're a fan of BBQ.",

We ordered the Pastrami Pork Belly and Fingerling Potato Salad. The pastrami was delicious as we're all four of the barbecue sauces (hot, traditional, mustard, and seasonal rhubarb).  I used the pastrami, bread, pickled cabbage and onions to make a small sandwich and my wife ate the pastrami by itself. I don't normally like potato salad but this version was really good. For dessert, we tried the S'mores which was awesome. We ordered the tri-tip to go for our son and he enjoyed every bite of it.  We would definitely eat here again.",

They have their homemade BBQ sauces out on all the tables for you to try as much or as little as you want, which was a major perk because there's not much I love more than sauce options.   We went with a large group and ordered so many things. The pigs ears and frito pie apps, and a few different meats and sides. All the meats and sides came out on a big tray and we were able to just eat family style and pass things around.   Everyone enjoyed their cocktails and I went outside of my comfort zone with a wine + coke drink on draft, and I enjoyed it as well. We left looking forward to going back!

You can usually just slide right in after a show or a game.  We enjoy sitting at the bar- so many craft beer choices. I recently had the cider mule and it was so tasty. I love the Cobb salad, and the pulled pork quesadilla, but the pork rinds have my heart. The pastrami spiced pork belly is really good and inspired my husband to do something similar in slider form. The brisket options we've had have been a bit tough, which was a bummer, but not inedible. All-in-all, a nice casual spot downtown with fun decor, large portions of comfort food, a great drink selection especially if you like beer, with usually no wait or a short one.",

Since it was happy hour we started with the bruschetta which was supposed to be $5 and was actually really good but we were charged full price. Im not sure but we assumed the happy hour version was probably half size and we enjoyed it so we didnt complain.  We came for the smoked meats but were pretty disappointed. The pulled pork was very average, and the brisket was decent but with a smoker at home, it did not live up to the hype. The meat didn't seem to have much smoke. The sides were ok, the beans seemed overspiced and the mac and cheese wasnt that cheesy.   We were seated at a table with other people (not a problem), but the table was uncomfortable because there is a pipe that is flush with the tabletop and runs knee height down the length of the table which was really unnecessary. It was also very loud and crowded (not a big deal either, but was noticeable).  Our waiter was not very attentive, but the food came pretty quickly. The $5 happy hour beers were worth the cost at least. We aren't planning on going back. This was the first of the group that we've tried, and still plan on trying the others, but I hope they will be better than this experience.",

I appreciate where they were going but the drink that I got was essentially an old fashioned with WAY too much sweetener in it. Great beer list, but honestly for $11 I was pretty disappointed in my drink.  I would ABSOLUTELY go back and try basically everything else on the menu!!",

And my friend loved the tiny bottle of Chandon she had.   For appetizers we ordered the Deviled Eggs of the Day (chorizo) and the jalapeno corn fitters w/honey butter. Oh man, both were so delicious! And we noticed they gave great sizes for both.   We had a hard time deciding on dinner so really leaned on our waiter to help us out and he was spot on with his suggestions! I love when I ask a waiter their favorites when they actually narrow it down. Our waiter gave us suggestions based on just the two of us present and we ordered exactly what he said: jerky baby back ribs, brisket, Mac & cheese, & the kale salad (and we also got the beans because \"pork & beans\". Everything was absolutely delicious, the ribs and the kale salad were my favorite but the Mac & cheese was creamy goodness (idk what other people reviewing are complaining about, I didn't order a sharp cheddar quesadilla, I ordered creamy Mac and that's exactly what I got). During the meal we also ordered the one of the red wines, it was the second one listed on the menu, that was pretty good (rated a 3.7 on Vivino but I would go so far as deeming it a 3.9).   For dessert, we split the peanut butter/chocolate Leona ice cream sandwich was amazing - it was a perfect balance of chocolate & peanut butter but was shockingly light. Considering we were both whispering about needing to unbutton our pants at this point, we powered through.  Important to note that we had a great server - their runner was struggling a bit and brought us our left overs in a ripped bag that was soaked on the bottom. We let our server know and he brought us another bag, my friend noticed it was also ripped and just as she discretely showed me the rip, he came back laughing as he had intentionally done it as an April Fools joke - it was great and well timed.   Hands down, this has been my favorite dining experience in Pittsburgh and I'll definitely be back.",

If you are a person who thinks Chili's has good bbq, you will love it. They even get the presentation right. Sides of picked onions and carrots on a cool serving dish. Legit.   4 Stars because it looked like the service staff was a bit grumpy. Our server was awesome tho. Everyone else just looked mad. That's a red flag. Why the long faces?",

Let's get that out of the way or this wouldn't be a 3 star review. This is where it ended for me. Juicy fresh ribs and pulled pork. The ribs are small for spares and $14 for those is borderline.   BBQ is not spicy. All 4 of their sauces are too spicy. The classic (anything but) has the least. Only hipster BBQ is spicy. Never real Dixie Q.   The sides are terrible. The beans are loaded with whatever and were so salty we sent them back. Should have sent the overworked greens back too for the same offense. The slaw we got as a replacement was good except for the strange addition of raw onions that left a nasty aftertaste.   Send out beans that taste like beans and greens that taste like greens. The greens should have some mild porky flavor and a bit of vinegar. Done.   I like the pickle, cabbage and onion garnishes on the tray. Very nice.  It's all overthought.",

I added cheese...for an extra dollar and it comes with their chips. I asked if I could have the fries instead of the chips since their other fish dish had fries that accompanied it and the waiter said that would be no problem. The Jojo potatoes were more like thick wedges. Good but could have been cooked a little longer to have a softer texture. When it was time for the check I noticed that I was charged $6.00 for the swop out of fries instead of chips. I was not happy with that nor was I advice that it would be a charge. An added cost I would understand but a full side order charge I didn't think was rights....since I actually didn't receive the chips that technically came with it already. Over all it wasn't that bad. The martini was really good though.",

But only because we happened to order the same thing? Silly, and potentially awkward depending on your companion, if you ask me. Also not a huge fan of communal bench seating. I get that it's a hipster thing, but why make a concerted effort to make dining less than comfortable? I don't get it, so I'll shut up and order takeout next time ;)",

The 5 of us shared a double order of brisket, the pulled pork and pork belly along with mac n cheese, beans and broccoli salads. The brisket was incredible.

Rustic atmosphere and decor with a modern twist that makes you feel like you're eating at an authentic BBQ joint in the Midwest. Friendly, knowledgeable staff who were able to make some great suggestions and recommendations. Extensive selection of draft beers and some awesome original cocktails on the menu as well.   The food was equally as satisfying. Everything was so tasty and full of flavor, with generous helpings that will be sure have you unbuttoning the top button of your pants by the end of the night. Each table is set with 3-4 bottles of BBQ sauce including an original and a seasonal sauce which really added to the meal.  We ordered the pulled pork, brisket and the Jo Jo fries and Mac 'n Cheese for sides and it was all amazing. The pulled pork came with slider buns and raddachio slaw which I absolutely loved. I really don't like or eat coleslaw, but the slaw at pork and beans was so flavorful and delicious.   Can't wait to come back here! Although next time, I may not eat for a full day in advance just to prepare.....",

We went with pulled pork off of the \"family style \"menu, and for two people, we were given two potato slider buns, to go with a huge mound of pulled pork. After finishing the three bite slider roll, we asked for more rolls, and the waitress asked us how many, which I thought was strange. I said at least two, so that we could each have another sandwich. There was still more pork left even after two slider sandwiches each. Upon getting our bill, I found that we were charged a quarter for each of those rolls. It's not so much about the price as it is this being family style, and given two slider buns for two people, and not being told that it would cost more to get more bread to cover the pork we had. Normally two sliders per person is the portion size. The food was ok, but the ice cream sandwiches rocked! Also, we ate at 6pm, and they were out of their only entree on the menu.",

I was staying across the street at the Renaissance and this place is located directly across the street so it was easy to walk to.  I grabbed a spot at the bar and was debating between a pulled pork platter or a pulled pork sandwich.  I went with the pulled pork sandwich.  Service was very good throughout and they probably had about 20+ beers on tap with a number I had never heard of so props to them there.    The pulled pork sandwich was borderline excellent.  The pork wasn't dry at all which it can sometimes be and it came with pickles and fried jalapenos which complemented the sandwich nicely.  I wasn't blown away by their selection of BBQ sauces which was slightly disappointing for a BBQ joint.  The fries were actually some of the more unique fries I've ever had.  If you can follow this - they were almost like large steak wedges / fries then battered and deep fried.  It was almost like a breaded Buffalo wing coating but not spicy at all.  They were interesting to say the least and also probably incredibly unhealthy.    It was a cool spot.  If back in the area, I would definitely go to again.  Prices were pretty reasonable for good food in a downtown spot.  No parking but there was a parking garage fairly close.",

We ordered a lot of meat (ribs, brisket, pulled pork) and everything was cooked wonderfully, juicy and tender. Love the dirty jojo fries, and they have a very large drinks menu for beer, wine, and cocktails, 3 pages worth. Our waiter was helpful in explaining a lot of the menu items for us. The inside of the restaurant is very rustic and western themed. Was very busy, a bit loud, but not crowded. This place is perfect for groups, as they have booths and very long bench tables, and the portion sizes are on the larger side. I'd definitely come here when I'm in PA again.",

We got 2 pulled pork, 2 brisket, 1 tri-tip, 1 ribs, and 2 sausage of the day for the meats and 2 mac n cheese, 1 collared greens, 1 carrot salad, and 1 potato salad for the sides. To drink, we tried their house gin & tonic, and their take on an old fashioned. The drinks (both $10) were good, but not great!   Everything was amazing. If I had to choose, I would stick with the brisket, tri tip and pulled pork. It's great to see tri tip on the menu, since I grew up eating it all the time in California. The carrot salad was phenomenal, although the portion was pretty small. The greens had amazing flavor. The mac n cheese was great because it's mac n cheese, but nothing special about it in my opinion.   I'd say the meats are fairly priced, but the sides are a bit expensive ($7 each) since the portions are so small.   FYI there is a $2.5 cake fee, per person. I thought this was a bit steep, but there's nothing you can really do about it!   Overall a great restaurant and a fun environment. I'd definitely come back and recommend it to a friend!",

We were put on the wait list and told it would be an hour and 15 minutes (Saturday night), but they actually got us in about 45 minutes! The drinks were awesome.  My friends grabbed a mule, but I stuck to solid seasonal beer choices.  Three of us in the group split 2 meats and 2 sides, and we were all stuffed and even had a little left on the plate.  I'm excited to go back some time soon! PS.  I cannot recommend the tri-tip enough!!! It was delectable!",

    "text": "Pork-n-Beans..  WOW!!  Arrived at 4...very comfortable back bar stools and ordered a drink - reservations for 4:30 came downtown a little early.  After reading up on all of my fellow yelper detailed reviews; I was well aware of the seating in at PnB.  I not a fan of the communal tables.  I prefer a more intimate experience when dining out.  There are several tables and some booths in the back, which I thought were great but found out after I inquired they only seat 3 - 4 people - not 2.  So decided to have the meal at the bar and it was a great experience.  I totally recommend it actually.  By 5:00 the restaurant was almost packed.     I want to give warm shout out to the bartender \"Mya\" who provided me with the best level of service possible.  Just selecting my beverage was tough yet fun.  There were so many IPA's to choose from.   I decided on \"Nugget Nectar | Troegs Independent Brewing\" It was delicious.    Let's talk about the delicious food. The menu.. short and simple loved it.. The way the information is provided on the menu in makes ordering a breeze. I am a huge lover of \"Pastrami\" so went with the Pastrami Pork Belly:  It was delicious and so tender.  Sides \"Ranch Slaw\" - very tasty but slaw was no doubt drowning in the ranch. \"Fries\" simple potato wedges.  The fries were a perfect way to sample the 4 bbq sauces - which were all equally great.  It was tough to identify a favorite... *classic* fits the name - no doubt.  So flavorful and safe for those who don't care for anything too spicy or bold.  The *seasonal*sauce was top notch too and ideal for those how like it hot/spicy.    All of the smoked meats come with rolls, house pickles, onions and red cabbage on a tray with your sides.  Its really a fun meal.  The prices are above average but you get what you pay for folks and its worth it.  It was an unforgettable experience.   Thanks Pork n Beans.",

However, I was not a fan of the flavor of the barbecue as it was more Smokey than sweet. They had lots of options for sauce, but none that were sweet. The unique seating situation which allows seating next to strangers at large tables worked for our party because we took up a whole table, but I would find it uncomfortable for a group of two.",

The service was some of the worst I've had in a long time and I eat out multiple times a week. Our server couldn't be more dismissive. We waited more than 15 minutes to even be acknowledged then our food took more than 20 minutes.   We didn't see our server until it was time for the check, which we had to ask her to give to us. No drink refills. No checking on the quality of the food.   As for the food, The Brisket was very good and the MAC and Cheese was awesome. The pickled veggies that come with the meat is nothing but pickles and onions. The pulled pork was a huge disappointment. It was way over seasoned. Meat like that should stand on its own. My girlfriend LOVES pulled pork and couldn't eat it. We ordered the JoJo fries which are potato wedges that are breaded. They were so salty they couldn't be eaten.   All in all it was a bad experience and we won't be back.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of the Richard Deshantz restaurant group, and I personally place both Butcher and the Rye and tako in my personal top five restaurants in Pittsburgh. I was so excited to hear about this fourth restaurant concept, Pork & Beans, and made early December dinner reservations with friends to check it out.  The seating is a bit tricky in here. There is a large bar area, rows of community tables, and just a few private booths lining one side of the restaurant. Without requesting a booth, we got very lucky and were seated in one, while many other poor souls with reservations sat in the communal seating bumping elbows with strangers in the middle of the restaurant.  Like its three sibling restaurants, Pork & Beans is decorated to perfection. However, unlike its predecessors, the restaurant is quirky and whimsical in a goofy way, rather than being more trendy and serious. I really enjoyed this component. You can't help but smile when the Pimento Cheese app is served with a sleeve of Ritz crackers, a coffee can holds silverware on the table, and beer is served in a brown paper bag.   Our server was excellent as well. She was attentive without being overbearing, made great recommendations, and always had a big smile on her face.  Now to the food and drinks... We started with the Pimento Cheese and the Deviled Eggs. For our shared meats, I believe we ordered the Pulled Pork, Beef Ribs, Brisket, Tri-Tip, and Sausage which came with a pile of Hawaiian Rolls (yes, more smiles) and sides of Mac-n-Cheese and Broccoli Salad. Really, everything was very good. All of the meat was cooked to perfection and showcased a nice variety. The Mac-n-Cheese side was my personal favorite, which had a rich, thick, gooey cheese sauce. Not one item disappointed.   The drinks were seconds priority for me after all the delicious food. I had hoped to try a number of different things, but ended up being way too full. I just ordered one cocktail (I believe it was the Starter Pack which was simultaneously good yet strange) and shared a 25oz bottle of La Fin Du Monde with my girl friend (an amazing selection for all you Belgian beer lovers like us).  Now the interesting conclusion... I really liked Pork & Beans and highly recommend it whenever the restaurant comes up. However, it's not going to make its way anytime soon into my Pittsburgh top five. While Pork & Beans provides very solid food in a quirky environment, I didn't leave the restaurant with my mind blown like I do after leaving some of the other Deshantz establishments.",

    "text": "The food was delicious. The service was great. The atmosphere is VERY loud, so it can be difficult to have conversations with those in your party. The way seating works, it's very likely you'll be seated at a table with others (they have large tables in the middle of the room) where you'll be a couple inches from people on either side of you who are not with your party. You may be able to request a private booth (they do have a few) and these may be a bit quieter, too. Though the table was pretty narrow and we were right across from each other, it was sometimes hard to hear what was being said.   The food was wonderful and not that expensive. The main complaint I have (Bryan's was the noise) is that there are barbeque sauces on the table you share with those on one side of you and these were TERRIBLY sticky. Though I had not touched my food with my hands (the meat even came right off the bones for the spare ribs, so there was no need to get your hands dirty), my hands ended up very sticky. They give you wet wipes, but my hands shouldn't get sticky if I just want sauces and use my utensils for the food. I think this could be solved mostly by them using squirt bottles for the sauces instead of the bottles they use. Some of the sauces were REALLY runny, too, which made them difficult to pour without them spilling a bit on the bottle. I wiped it off when this happened, but it seemed that they were never wiped with a wet rag.  We'll go back, but I may pick up and open the bottles solely with paper towels next time.",

I have always lucked out getting seats at the bar or the communal table.  However, I recommend reservation if you know in advance you're heading there.  It's always packed and it shines in downtown in the midst of stuffy \"upscale\" dining.  I love the energy here and all the wait staffs have been great and attentive.  ..FOOD.. Order off the a la carte menu to share with your party.  They say it's about 1/2 pound of meat per person for good measure.  I tend to over-order and here are my favorites: Sausage (they have different flavors) Bone marrow Chicken (souv vide chicken in a can, with spicy sauce) Brisket (on a good day, it's so moist and delicious) Collard greens Mac and cheese  ..DRINKS.. They've got an interest list of drinks, ranging from bombs to shots to cocktails.  I like their bombs (alcohol + beer).  Their cocktails have very interesting ingredients..some did not mix well together.  Bottom line:  Pork & Beans barbecue doesn't disappoint!  Def my downtown jewel.",

Well for me it is at least and as soon as I got to Pork & Beans, sat down and saw that they had a frozen rose  machine I was all in (side note: I was a little less in when I got the bill and saw that they were $10 a pop, goodness!). Monetary value aside, they were tasty, albeit small, they were tasty.  Ok, but enough about my fixation on that sugary alcoholic drink, lets talk about everything else. Being from Pittsburgh and living there for many years I would have never imagined a place like this popping up. No, I don't think it's an authentic BBQ experience, but does one come to Pittsburgh for a southern flare? No, when I'm home I want pierogis, so if a restaurant says it's a BBQ joint, I'm going to believe it and give it a shot.  I ordered the Rachel sandwich which of of course was their play on a traditional Rachel, but with pork. The pork was absolutely delicious. Fatty, but even the fatty pieces were amazing. Every bite was more and more delicious. At first glance I thought the sandwich was on the small side, but it ended up being just enough. Paired with their mac & cheese which was an absolute must. I was a little greedy and ordered their jo jo fries which were potato longs. In theory I love potato logs but I wasn't a huge fan of these. I asked for ranch to dip but I'm not sure I got ranch, if I did, I didn't like it. The fries definitely need to be dipped in something- maybe a BBQ sauce?  Our service was SUPER friendly. He could have sat with us, that's how many times he checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Definitely hope this stays around. I would come back when I visit for sure. Next time I might skip the alcohol and go straight for the food.",

Well that was my experience with Pork and Beans. I the design of the restaurant! Kudos to the designer. Every wall is something interesting: reclaimed wood mosaic, beer can art, stacked firewood, light fixtures with reclaimed pipe...my eyes were captivated.  It gave the real feel of a roadside BBQ shack in the south.   The service was good and when the food finally arrived it was tasty. Our party sampled the house made hot dog and kielbasa along with the smoked tri-tip and brisket. The brisket was my favorite - tender, moist and well seasoned. The sides we tried included the charred carrot salad, broccoli salad, Mac and cheese, and jalapeno corn fritters. The carrot salad was interesting but I thought it needed some acid to make it pop. Broccoli salad was fine but nothing special; mac and cheese and corn fritters were the favorites. The fritters were particularly good - hot and crispy with a delicate crumb and fresh jalapeno.   We enjoyed the experience and would go back. Be aware that they seat people at Long tables so you may be elbow to elbow with strangers but it wasn't a problem for us. They do have a few private tables along one wall.   Recommended!",

    "text": "We are out of towners, but have made a point of hitting other Richard DeShantz's restaurants (Butcher and the Rye, Tako, etc), so we definitely wanted to hit this at least for lunch. To keep it simple, the chicken sandwich was the perfection we've become accustomed to, while the rest of our meal was forgettable. The Korean BBQ sandwich was way too peppery, and the chips seriously over seasoned. The homemade ice cream sandwiches were a step up from chipwiches but nowhere near worth the $7. I'd come back for the chicken sammy and the All Day IPA stovepipe tallboys but that's it. My two cents.",

The list of drafts and canned drinks available provides a good variety.  The bbq meats were very good. I had the ribs lunch platter and my husband had the smoked brisket. The sauces, especially the seasonal ginger soy sauce all had great flavor. We tried the greens, potatoe salad, Mac and cheese, and burnt end beans. The greens were very flavorful and had a slight kick to them. The burnt end beans were also slightly spicy. The Mac and cheese was bland with a heavy topping of bread crumbs and the potatoe salad wasn't bad. The service was good and the prices were decent for the portions. We will come back.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved Union Pig and Chicken and am still sad that they closed. I was excited to hear about Pork and Beans and have wanted to check it out since it opened, but could never score a table as the restaurant always had a wait and reservations were hard to come by. We recently tried Chef Michael Symon's Mabel's BBQ up and Cleveland and loved it so we definitely had to compare the two. I was totally shocked when my wife surprised me by taking me to Pork and Beans for Father's Day.   Being that it was Father's Day and a Pirate baseball game was starting shortly there were just a few other families when we arrived for our reservation. Once we were seated at a table Kylie our waitress came to tell us how the menu worked and take our drink orders. It was pretty much identical to Mabel's so we had a good idea what we wanted to order. The seating is communal which I usually despise, but since the restaurant wasn't crowded I didn't mind it so much. They do offer a few booths as well.  My wife and I were only going to just drink water, but after both tasting our daughter's Boylan Cream Soda which was delicious by the way we both ordered one for ourselves, but at $4 a glass next time we will all just drink water.  As far as the meat goes we went with the Pork Belly, Spare Ribs, Brisket and 1/4 Fried Chicken Dark Meat (drumstick and thigh). For our sides we chose the Collard Greens, Mac & Cheese and Burnt Ends and Beans. The pork belly was out of this world. It was melt in your mouth good! Like meat flavored butter. The brisket and spare ribs were quite tasty also. Very moist and tender enough to cut with a fork. There are four different barbecue sauces on the table. I only tried the mustard based sauce as that is the type I usually prefer. It was tanging, but too watery for my taste.  The fried chicken was outstanding. Perfectly cooked with a nice hard crust outside and tender meat inside. Not as good as Union Pig, but close. I really liked the honey tabasco barbeque sauce that came with the chicken. It had a slight kick and was quite unique. My only complaint is that the two pieces of chicken were quite small for $8. Next time I will just get a half chicken.  The collard greens were tender and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. The mac & cheese could of had more cheese and I would have prefered for the noodles to have been slightly more al dente. The burnt ends and beans were not your usual bake beans. They were quite different as they featured several different types of beans, but were still enjoyable.   The pickles, cabbage and onion garnishes on the tray were a nice touch. I really like the fact that they give you diner rolls as well so you can make little barbeque sandwiches if you so chose. Once we were finished Kylie packed up the rest of our food and even packed us some of all four of their barbeque sauces.  So how does Pork and Beans stack up to Mabel's? I think that they are neck and neck. Both are similar and different at the same time. Even the decor is similar. Mabel's doesn't take reservations, have fried chicken or mac and cheese, but their ribs and brisket are superior so Mabel's squeaks out the win. Barely.",

We arrived just a few minutes late, while the couple we were meeting was running a bit later. We were seated despite not having the full party and decided on drinks, a DIPA for him and the Tracey Mule for me, and the jalapeno corn fritters to start. The draft list was pretty extensive and would appeal to just about any type of beer-drinker, and the mule was very tasty as well. The fritters were just okay, wish we would have went with the dirty fries.  After the rest of our group arrived, we quickly ordered. The brisket was definitely the winner of the evening; it was cooked to perfection and basically melted in your mouth. Another plus was the fact that they had gluten free dishes and modification options for my GF friend.",

Order the Jojo Fries, they are so good (fancy potato wedges is how I'd describe them). They have lots of sauces at the table to try.

    "text": "Do you know how long I waited for the Pork and Beans restaurant to open?  A verrrryyy long time!    I kept going to the Meat and Potatoes website hoping for an update on the opening of Pork and Beans, until finally the logo and the \"Stayed Tuned\" message disappeared from the Meat and Potatoes website. ( I felt like a stalker...)  And then, finally.  Manna from heaven, I read about the grand opening in the local newspaper.  Unfortunately for me, there were no lunch hours reported. (I say this because I like to visit new restaurants during lunch for several reasons...One, I don't live near Downtown Pittsburgh and to visit a \"new\" restaurant and face possible disappointment is too much for me to bear and two, why spend a lot of money on a new restaurant and then again, be disappointed.  Better to them out during their lunch service.)  I did, however, stop by to check out the decor before leaving for home one day. (Very eclectic decor with nods to upscale country and industrial chic both in the same swathe.  I liked it a lot.)  Well, fast forward y'all!  Pork and Beans is now open for lunch!  Yippee Skippee!  I informed one half of my dynamic lunch duo that Pork and Beans is now open for lunch and we literally dropped everything to go to lunch there. (You can't make reservations for lunch, so it's first come, first served.)  I ordered one of the lunch specials (Deep Fried Smoked Pork Ribs served with seasonal potato salad and broccoli salad) and my lunch partner ordered the Grilled Smoked Meatloaf with house made pickles, white onion, fried onions, roasted shallots, tomatoes and horseradish creme.  I know there are some barbecue purists who are shaking their heads at the thought of deep fried ribs, but I'm going to ignore your shaking heads.  They were delicious and bone sucking good.  The accompanying broccoli and potato salads were also on point and provided that needed balance to the succulence of the pork.  I also love meatloaf.  Not the mystery loaf that some institutions serve to get rid of leftover whatever, but serious meatloaf that utilizes prime ingredients.  My dad's baby sister makes fabulous turkey meatloaf that I crave on a consistent basis.  This smoked meatloaf is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  This is NOT your mama's meatloaf and it will change your mind about loafs of meat moving forward.  This restaurant now has my dinner worthy seal of approval.",

There was some water drippage from storms earlier in the day, but for the most part we stayed dry.    The beer list is pretty long and we each found something interesting to try.  I wouldn't say it's the best beer list out there, but there are lots of options for beer lovers of all types.  And my favorite part...maybe because I'm a nerd, is that our receipt came in a washed out can of Pork & Beans.  Bonus points!  All in all, if you're in town, give it a try!",

We settled on loaded fries, ribs, pork belly, brisket, greens, mac & cheese, broccoli salad and the baked beans with potatoes wedges to boot.  We have few leftovers and didn't really care for the pork belly ( way too fatty even for pork belly) but enjoyed every other item. The Leonas ice cream sandwiches (which we all love) because they are local and yummy were a great way to end our meal.   Paired with Voodoo Met and a few Moscow Mules( with Titos)! Drinks were well made.",

The mac & cheese paired really well with the strong flavors of the fall off the bone ribs.  The food arrived quickly (5:30 pm res on a weekday).  Drinks were a bit slow, but I really enjoyed the selection of cocktails and beers.  Everyone that worked there was smiling and friendly.  The space and decor were great, and it wasn't too loud to chat which is a rarity these days.  I took one star off for the communal seating.  We were lucky, and got there early enough to sit at the end of one, with a gap between us and the other diners due to a barrier of sauces, etc.  Others weren't so lucky.  I'm not sure I would go there during a busy time unless I had a reservation & a party of 3 or more.  If you have a party of 2, maybe try to sit at the bar if you can't get the end of a table.  The seats looked very comfy.",

The draft list is impressive and you can also order 40's complete with the brown paper bag. We tried the pork rinds and dirty fries. Both were good, however, the fries were a little underdone. We ordered the signature pork and beans entree. The server brought the can of pork and beans out and opened it in front of us and poured it over the toast on the dish. The only complaint is that the temperature was a bit too room temperature for my liking. The choice of four saues were my absolute favorite part. The seasonal sauce is to die for! For desert, we shared a Leona's ice cream sandwich. Looking forward to trying more from Pork and Beans!",

    "text": "Pork and Beans is probably my favorite \"new\" restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Rotating food and drink options keep it a new experience every time.   Ease of Entry: This is probably the largest negative in eating here.  They do not use NoWait like many of the other restaurants in the area.  You can book reservations online, but sometimes that is spotty.   It is a very popular spot in the city, so walk-ins are very difficult to achieve.    Atmosphere: Really cool vibes throughout.  Chain-linked fences and rustic signs put off the hidden BBQ haven/food truck ambiance.  Really clever how they made use of the materials that they did.  Each time I go, I notice a little touch that I didn't notice the time before.  They also have a very cool bar seating area that faces the street so you can people watch while you eat and drink.  Very well done.   Service: Service has always been top-notch.  Very attentive with zero complaints.  The bill is brought out in a Campbell's Soup Pork and Beans can, which is a clever touch.  Food: Everything that I have tried so far has been delicious.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  I typically order off the specials list, so it might not be worth putting any of those items on here.  My wife has gotten the bbq pulled pork sandwich every time that we have gone and she loves it.  I don't see her trying anything else.   If the bolognese is ever on the menu when you are there, you have got to try it.   Drink: Most recently I tried a \"Mountain Squirrell\" which was a frozen mountain dew/tequila drink.  It was so damn good I didn't try anything else off the menu.  Value: The cost for some of the items seem a little higher than they should be, but I guess when you are downtown, have a great ambiance, service and food/drink options it's worth shelling out a few extra bucks for the experience.",

Most of those attendees were standing, so I did find a place at the bar.  The bartender approached me right away, explaining the menu and taking my order.  I started with the Happy Hour wings, dry rub, and a Frose cocktail.  My entree, included the jalapeno cheddar smoked sausage link, with mac-n-cheese and collard greens.  The Frose was excellent!  Frozen wine cocktail, very tasty.  The wings were not as flavorful as I would have hoped, but cooked well, and much better once I dipped in 2 of the house bbq sauces, the traditional and tangy mustard, mixed.   My entree arrived, a short time later, I was hoping for a plain smoked sausage, but of the 4 offered that day, none were plain, there was a seafood chowder sausage (pass:-), and 2 other selections.  I opted for the jalapeno cheddar and was pleasantly surprised, larger portion that other bbq places, nice flavor and not too spicy.  The mac-n-cheese was tasty too, a bit rich, but good.  The greens were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Both sides were generously portioned.   I had enough of the entree left, for lunch the next day.   All-in-all, this was a great meal, along with great service.  I would absolutely return!",

The brisket was dry as a bone, we are from Texas , it shouldn't be dry. The sauces were pretty sweet so we passed on those. The positives, the collard greens we're the best we have ever tasted, the ribs and pulled pork were great too. I would definitely come again.",

I got the flavor from the brisket, American cheese, and whiz cheese coming together and almost making it like a BBQ version of a Philly cheesesteak. It was a little messy but it was very creamy with the cheese which I loved.   A few things I wasn't a fan of are that the service wasn't great. Our waiter was very inattentive and disappeared for long periods of time. I get that they were busy but I expected a little more service wise. It was also a little louder in there than I'd have liked- not a major thing but a slight inconvenience since it made conversation with the rest of my group a little more difficult. Also for most of my time there my phone had no service which surprised me since they had the place open to the patio since it was such a nice night out.   The negatives other than service were small things but the service has to be better. I'd give the food a 5 star review and the whole experience a 3 star review. But since it was one time with bad service I'll give them a 5 for now and see if the service is better next time I go...the food was well worth taking another trip for next time I'm in town.",

Back to the Meat Sweats, after trudging back to my apartment, which is about a mile uphill, my friend starts sweating profusely and looking quite uncomfortable as we ride up the elevator.   He's looking dangerously ill and is asked if he'll be ok, need any Tums, etc.  He claims he'll be alright so is safely driven back to L-ville.  He later claims to have slept for 12 hours straight in a recliner.  Do not underestimate the power of animal proteins and fats.  4 stars.  The brisket and burnt end beans are key.",

The earliest reservations we could get were late so we arrived early so we could check in and have a drink or two while waiting on our table.  I let the hostess know we would be open to seating earlier if anything came available.  Unfortunately, we watched multiple spots for 2 people open or even while tables open and never got an early seat (which we were Ok with if it was actually full until our reservations).  We ended up getting a table right at our reservation time and it was made up with getting a private booth table and our server was awesome!

Parking wasn't bad, with there being an abundance of parking garages close by. I'm a big fan of Valet, but the surrounding Valets were charging $15, far more then what's come to be a standard around the city.  The restaurant itself has a cool, rustic vibe to it with the  aromas of BBQ sauce hitting you as soon as you walk in. We were seated at a communal table near the back of the restaurant. Luckily for us we were place on the end of the table and had some open leg room to one side. Those couples seated in the middle of the table certainly had to find the space cramped, and a little invasive. You have to be prepared and ready for everyone to share in your conversation, and constantly look over at what you're eating, etc. Definitely not for everyone.  The food itself was exactly what we expected. If you're name is \"Pork and Beans\" you have to deliver on the meat, and that's what they did. Brisket cooked perfectly, with fat that melted in your mouth, mac and cheese seasoned perfectly and the pickled accompaniments set the entire platter off right.  For the price, and the quality its really worth checking out, and would definitely recommend.",

Our BBQ roots are from Texas and we haven't had tremendous luck in finding True, smoked meats with authentic sides while spending some of our time in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant has an eclectic, yet rustic feel.  I'm not crazy about the metal fencing that separates the bar area from the restaurant and equally not crazy about the long, communal tables that provide most of the seating.  The beer list is extensive.  We ordered chicharrones to start with; crispy, fried pork rinds served with a slightly spicy remoulade.  We followed with brisket, pulled pork, collard greens and mac&cheese.  The meats were flavorful; but the brisket could have had a slightly more smoky flavor.  The collard greens were tasty, but some of the grit that can be found from less-than-fully rinsed greens was still present.  The mac & cheese was sinfully rich.  Pork & Beans comes the closest yet in delivering the BBQ tradition that these two Texans have been searching for in the land of Three Rivers.  Kudos.",

We didn't get alcohol, just cokes. I was supposed to take a customer here last week but the meeting was moved up and we didn't end up coming. Boy was I glad. This is not a place for a business meeting. It is extremely loud! Good for casual dining. There was a wooden crate on the table with 4 different sauces; classic, hot, tangy mustard and a seasonal butternut squash bbq sauce. The sauces were super liquidity with the exception of classic. It was a little thicker which is what I like. However, most importantly, all sauces had good flavor. I mixed the mustard and classic together. Super yummy! We both ordered the pulled pork plate and one side. I had collard greens and my friend had loaded baked potato salad. You get a roll, onions, bread and butter pickles and small amount of cabbage slaw on the side. The pulled pork had a nice Smokey flavor, was tender and not too dry but not wet either. Pretty tasty bbq for pittsburgh. The greens were seasoned nicely with a little mustard and a little heat, not too spicy. Very flavorful! Potato salad was bomb! Must get if you try this place out. It had huge chunks of delicious bacon, cheese, green onions and celery. We couldn't eat the whole portion of the pork but everything else was gone! We were stuffed! The bill came to $20 a person and that was no alcohol just cokes. Kind of pricey for bbq once you add tip and parking in. Everything is a la carte, most sides were $6 but large enough for 2 to share.  This was a great place but because it was very loud, kind of pricey for casual bbq and really good but not quite awesome, I give it 4 stars. I would come back again for sure.",

Two sides and potato rolls were include with the pulled pork. Their BBQed meats themselves are pretty good, but not amazing.  The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the mac'n'cheese. The heavy coating of breadcrumbs is oddly sweet, and it overpowers any flavor the mac'n'cheese itself had.  As long as they are not short staffed, its always been enjoyable to eat there.  I'd recommend checking it out for lunch or even dinner if you don't mind a meal with a bit higher price tag.",

I have to say that this place was a pretty cool looking restaurant, I really liked the communal seating, you don't see that very often. But since I was alone, I just found a spot at the bar. As always, I went with the Brisket, which did not let me down. It was the perfect fat to meat ratio that I was looking for.

EVERY dish we've gotten here is so good. The beer can chicken was my least favorite. Top choices- pimento cheese app, dirty jo jo fries, short ribs, and brisket. Mac and cheese too! Even friends from Texas raved about their BBQ. Will be back many times.",

    "text": "This is a cool restaurant that has cafeteria style/communal eating which as a dining trend, I think is kinda fun.  So the ambience is kinda loud and rustic.  The food for the most part is bought by the weight and meant to be like shared communally with your guests which kinda replicates how most people eat barbecue anyways.  The sides (beans and collards) were excellent and the vegetables in each retained a bit of \"bite\", so they still felt like vegetables and not the kind of \"cooked to nothingness\" that sometimes places default to.  They both were great. The brisket and the pork belly were bomb, so good in fact, me nor my guest even thought to put bbq sauce on.  This is real bbq with real smoke, not oven roasted and slathered with cloyingly sweet bbq.  I enjoyed this place thoroughly and he only thing stopping me from giving a fifth, is I don't throw my \"5th Star\" around unless it's like mind blowing.  Pork and Beans is great, satisfying, and a cool ambience.  Is it mind blowing?  No. But that certainly is no dig on this place.  They do it well.",

Excellent experience at Pork and Beans for me and my co-workers starting with the reservation process and continuing with the flexibility of the hostess, their selection at the bar, our service at the table, and of course, the perfectly prepared meats and sides. It rivaled anything I've had in more renowned BBQ joints across the country.  Keep doin what you're doin, ya playahs!",

    "text": "We were excited to try out this new Downtown restaurant and went for dinner on Valentine's Day. I made reservations through Yelp well in advance but we had no issues getting them.  Not ideal for a super romantic dinner as the seating is mostly shared community tables but it wasn't busy so we had the table to ourselves for most of our meal.  They have a great draft list and many can options as well.  I went with a sour beer by Long Trail which they let me try beforehand and it was very tasty.  The menu has meats that you can order which come with pickled veggies, 2 mini potato rolls and slaw or you can get a sandwich which has a little less meat on it. The sandwiches do not come with sides and you will need to order a size which are all $7.  Kinda pricey for my taste but for a special occasion it was fine. I went with the 1/2 pound of pulled pork which came with all of the items above. This was cheaper than the sandwich and a decent amount of food. I also got the broccoli salad as my side which was ok as it had huge chucks of the broccoli stems it is. My fiance ordered for his meal the turkey Devonshire sandwich which was topped with a ton of cheese, bacon and turkey on bread. He went with the mac and cheese as his side which was delicious but a little too much cheese for his meal.  Our waitress was great and love how they send out your recent in a Campbell's soup pork and beans can.  It is a cute place and we will probably be back.",

    "text": "We ate here on a sunny afternoon this weekend and enjoyed the sidewalk seats. I got the pulled pork and my friend got the brisket. We decided to share the burnt end beans. I got a beer, friend got some whiskey. Drinks are over priced in this city these days and Pork and Beans is no different.  I do think their cocktails are a bit small too.  The pulled pork was great. Tender and flavorful, even without sauce (which wasn't on our table and not offered to us by the waiter). The brisket wasn't visually appealing - all I could see when I looked at it was a huge layer of fat running through the middle, but surprisingly, it wasn't chewy, so that was a plus!  The burnt end beans are more like chili than a side and 7 bucks is crazy for the type of ingredients going into their sides (broccoli, greens, potato salad, mac n cheese - all pretty cheap ingredients).  Overall, a tasty meal.. but those buns. Those lackluster, pitiful buns. C'mon, guys. Take a minute away from smoking meat and create a signature bun that people will love pairing with your meats.",

Usually bbq is gluten free because it is just smoked meat and spices, but here they spray soy sauce  (which contains gluten) on all their smoked meats. Normally I would not let this count against a place, but I made reservations and specifically noted I was gluten free and they said it would be no problem. So when we show up and I can't have anything but a few sides it was very disappointing.  The atmosphere is cool though and the bar is fun, but I probably won't go back.",

    "text": "Disappointing.  We got the spare ribs and pulled pork.  The pulled pork has a VERY VERY salty, and had strong spices/curing salts on the surface portions.  The spare ribs also did not have great flavor due to over spicing/curing/rubs.  They come with pickled veggies - aka,  strips of onions (not really pickled), pickles, and a cabbage type veggie....also not impressive.  It was just bad barbeque.  We tried small red pea stew special (8 oz).  It had very distinct flavors that were not complimentary or comforting.  The 4 sauces are: classic, mustard-type, hot, and seasonal  (cranberry base).  None were anything special.  All but seasonal were very running and thin. Hot was not very hot.  The seasonal one was thicker and interesting flavor, but not interesting enough that I would take any home with me.  Layout: The front part is standing room,  bar, and some tables.  Then a chain link fence separating the main seating area. Main Seating is cafeteria style, tight.   The staff will  try to squish you in, even if the other half of the table is completely empty. We did have a reservation- early evening on Saturday.  We asked to be seated at the end of the table. After checking, they did accomadate us,   instead of squishing us in between 2 separate couples.    There are booths on the side, but you probably need a reservation in advance.  We did have a reservation and when we called, they said they were completely booked from 5:30 to 9pm. So we got an earlier reservation.  However when we got there it was almost empty, bar area was completely empty, main seating was less than half full.  5:15-6:15pm on Saturday night.  Restrooms were clean.  However, there is a large trough sink, that actually fits through hole in the wall connecting the men's and ladies rooms. You can see into the men's room and the ladies room from the other restroom ---- disturbing.  Also sounds and smells will be intermingling freely.  Disturbing again.   The faucets have a spicket handle like outside your house. They are not easy on your hands, and the water never really shuts off completely - wasting water.  Toilet paper is cheap quality.  There are only 2 stalls in ladies room -- so there will be lines,when busy.  The ceiling was a punched tin/metal and created a cool effect.  But it doesn't make up for the hole in the wall connection to men's room.  Staff - courteous and pleasant.  We are huge fans of Root 174 and were sad when it closed,  but we're eagerly anticipating the chef'snew creation.  We WERE HUGELY disappointed.    We actually stopped somewhere else to eat on the way home to feel full and get more water to dilute the saltiness.   We took over half our meals home as leftovers.....but they will be thrown out.  Disappointing :(",

Not sure how large the people who complain about tight seating but we had plenty of room for the two of us and enjoyed talking to new friends.  We got the pulled pork and beef brisket. While both were good the brisket was absolutely amazing - fork tender with a great crust. Sauces were all tasty but honestly the meat was worth eating plain. We split the dirty potatoes as our side, and they were the perfect combination of spice and gooey cheese plus a ridiculous number of BBQ bites. The total bill with a couple beers each was less than $70 and well worth it. We had a half pound of each meat and the potatoes and couldn't finish it all. We'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu!",
