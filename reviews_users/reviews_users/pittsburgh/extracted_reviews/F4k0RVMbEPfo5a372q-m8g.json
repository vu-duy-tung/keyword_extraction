Then I saw this place pop up on Eat24 and decided to try it.   I got the care pizza on wheat crust with garlic olive oil sauce. Its basically a burrito that blew up on a pizza...and it works so well. Huge generous chunks of avocado make it a healthy but fatty melody in my mouth. And afterwords, I didn't have the dirty sinking feeling I usually get when eating pizza.   This shit is clean, I wouldn't say healthy, but definitely the healthiest option when talking about pizzas. I don't see myself ordering from anywhere else in a good while.",

It was rainy and I was craving Italian wedding soup- big big mistake! Two tiny meatballs a spoonful of round little pasta and a quart of dishwater! Had to dump it out- unbelievably bad. Now on a good note- I also had a mini lunch pizza - pretty good- not great but four star pizza. So advice- when in a new pizza place- do not order soup- like when in a sports bar do not order lasagna!",

    "text": "First and foremost, it's not the worst pizza I have ever had because I once went to public school. BUT, I don't understand their sentiment about healthy food or their definition of healthy is horribly skewed.  They offer three types of crust - whole wheat, unbleached white dough, and gluten free. Given the gluten free trend, I'm assuming that's their definition of \"healthy\". Still, I'm a fan of whole wheat crust (which is rare unless you're making your own) and decided to give it a go. I ordered a small whole wheat pizza with red sauce, mozz, mushrooms, black olives, with one half with meatballs to appease the person I was splitting with. I also ordered breaded zucchini planks because I can't just say no to that.  When the pizza got here, it was nice and hot. It smelled great. Unfortunately, the taste didn't match the appearance. The crust was soggy, the sauce was bland, and the cheese was insanely rubbery (and probably the greasiest thing I've ever tried to eat.) I could only eat one slice because everything was sliding off the flimsy triangle. Fortunately, albeit also dripping in grease (which I expected in a fried veggie), the breaded zucchini planks were okay. I reheated the leftovers the next day in the oven using a little bit of olive oil cooking spray and it crunched the crust up pretty well but the cheese was still terrible.   The moral of the story is that you can go to Trader Joe's, buy a whole wheat pizza dough ball for $1.49, a few organic cheese sticks, veggies, and frozen meatballs to retreat this meal for less than $12 and it would probably be healthier than whatever this was.  I paid $30 including the tip (for just a small greaseball pizza and 4 pieces of deep fried zucchini). I could have just gone on a Tinder date and gotten that kind of disappointment for free. :(",

    "text": "This is the best delivery pizza I've ever had. I ordered online through them, an XL pizza with half covered in tomatoes and half covered in bacon and pepperoni with extra sauce. When I added a fountain soda to the order they gave me the option to get breadsticks for free and I opted to get cheesy ones for an extra $2 (yeah, they got me with that). The crust is not remarkable but I love their pizza sauce. It is very sweet which might not hit everyone the right way. The ingredients they use are really good, my friend who was eating the meaty side said that it was the best pepperoni he'd ever had. The pieces are cut really well too, I'm not a vegetarian but I appreciated that I didn't have to worry about any random peps or bacon pieces on my half. The breadsticks were delicious too, the only thing is that it only has cheese on top in the middle and is cut in half lengthwise and into a bunch of slices perpendicular to that so that there are 4 non cheesy slices on the ends. I was OK with this because I love any kind of white bread that is crunchy so they were very good to me. They gave us two ranch dipping cups with the pizza and we got a marinara one which my friend liked. Getting a 32oz fountain soda was much cheaper than getting something bottled, but it did come with a ton of ice in the cup. If you're looking for quality delivery pizza, definitely get some pizza from pizza care.",

Put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to get back to temperature.  The order was wrong: We ordered a large cheese pizza and hot wings. Our communications must have gotten crossed, because the pizza also came with hot sauce instead of traditional tomato sauce (which is an option for the place). It wasn't horrible, but not my preference and still an error on their part.  Price: A large pizza for $11 is reasonable. But what they call large is more like a medium at 14\".   I can get an 18\" for the same price at Pizza Amier, and they are of comparable quality.   Bottom Line:  I would try them again if I had limited options. Obviously the sauce mix up was a big downer, and surely they don't take that long for cold pizza as a norm. I could see this being pretty decent quality pizza.   That being said, I think Pizza Amier is my preference for delivery pizza for its price.",

However tonight, April 26th, I called to order their special that they have labeled on their \"online website\" under \"HOT DEALS\" and ordered the \"12 inch hoagie and dozen wings special for $11.99.\"  We went round and round for 33 minutes arguing about how I was wrong and how this was for their old menu.  I asked him have you ever heard the \"customer is always right\" phrase and he said yes and then immediatly again said no I am wrong.  He refused to honor Pizza Cares price that they had advertised, and on three separate occasions said \"yes Pizza Care will not honor their prices even though they mistakenly advertised their own product.\"  He admitted that they Falsely advertised their product but refused to honor it, and even saying that they will correct this problem in 2 days saying that it was their IT guys fault.  I even brought up that I have the reciept for when my roommate ordered this same \"special\" two nights prior with the cashier's name and date, however, this still did not matter.  I said that there was no excuse, it is not the customers fault that you advertised it wrong.  After arguing for 33 minutes and the guy on the phone saying the same thing over and over again, and having admitted multiple times that they were in fact \"wrong in this situation,\" this took a turn for the worst...  The guy on the phone, \"Rash-mir,\" obviously a foreigner based on his accent then asked me if I understood my own language; and I quote \"Do you even understand English?\"  So after bringing race into this and insulting me, he then went on to say that \"you are a waste of my time.\" This is an absolute disgrace and I will never order again, along with my roommates.  I will also tell everyone I know NOT to order from Pizza Care.  I have recommended Pizza Care to SO MANY people, and now I will go back and tell them otherwise now.  \"PIZZA CARE... More like PIZZA DOESN'T CARE\"",

The price for the quality of the healthy options? *sad face emoji* I've ordered from this place twice and I'm delighted to report that the food was tasty & delivery service was fast. Since the location teeters on the edge of the Hill District, I've never been inside the joint. They do, however, deliver to Mt Wash!    The latest meal I ordered was a gluten free margarita pizza. The gluten free crust was thin and crispy. I've attempted GF pizza crust countless times and it's a difficult task to master. I'm not sure if Pizza Care buys their GF crust from another company or if they make it in house but either way, round of applause! The crust was delicious. Their margarita style was served with tomato sauce (not diced or sliced tomatoes which I would have preferred) mozzarella slices (not shredded, a plus in my book) and shredded basil. The basil wasn't scarce but it wasn't enough to enjoy in every bite. The ranch served on the side is a nice gesture but I thought it took away from the margarita pizza experience.   Now I know what you're thinking- why the 3 star rating if the food was good and delivery was fast? Allow me to clarify...the pizza was small and priced the same as a large non-GF gourmet pizza. Delivery charge was a $1 so with taxes, my order came to $20 and change. When I say small, I mean it was slightly larger than a personal pan pizza. Enough for two people but not enough to justify the price. Especially with the lackluster basil and tomato sauce instead of slices, I can't place Pizza Care on my list of go-to GF pizza joints.  My fellow foodies: don't rule this place out if you're not concerned with the price!",

    "text": "Nom. Nom. Nom. Nom. Nom. Pizza Care really is a unique quality of delivery pizza to order from.  I give it 5 stars despite having one complaint. I'm going to get my one complaint out of the way- And then continue.  The one thing they could improve upon- They don't have Heinz Ketchup as their delivery ketchup packets. This is Pgh, that baffles me. Now, I've accepted this and usually plan around this with my own Heinz brand Ketchup abundantly on hand when needed. Despite their tomato catsup faux pas, I'm still giving them 5 stars for their quality of delivery & food. And here is why---  Pizza Care has options. And I mean high quality, fresh, healthy options like hand crafted gourmet pizza's with fresh mozzarella on a mixed grain crust with hand broken herbs and fresh tomato..... It's a spectrum of choices. They have crafted gourmet pizza items and standard yummy basic white flour crust, shredded mozzarella, perfectly seasoned homemade sauce, & greasy pepperoni pizza everyone loves.   What makes Pizza Care stand out amongst the 1000 other places one can order pizza from in the area? - Ethics. Most places are slinging pizzas trying to lure in college kids with cheap prices and fast delivery.   Pizza Care is using ethical practices & healthier standards. The cheese is all natural real. Olive oil is the oil used. Sodium is limited and only sea salt is used. The flour is unbleached. No preservatives or sugar is used. The care put into their recipes is amazing and the quality shows.   Now trying to decide on what to order from Pizza Care isn't always easy at our house. It varies depending upon our moods. Sometimes we just use a coupon and order a bundled meal deal. There are some great coupons available. We do love to get a XL cheese pizza w xtra cheese & a pepperoni pizza on Sunday's for our evening cable tv splurge.   I highly suggest not overlooking some of the following items. We also love these items:   Buffalo Fries- my husband loves to add these on to an order.  The yummy fresh cut potato bites that are lightly seasoned.  You can add cheese to them with bacon. I prefer them without the added toppings.  I add my own ketchup.   Salads- there are so many salad choices. I love the beet salad customized. From my experience, they have been very nice about customizing salads. The fresh veggie list is extensive. Go crazy.   Pasta- Love the chicken & roasted peppers, the ravioli, and eggplant. All are household favorites. The chicken with peppers is with penne, mushrooms, pepper, in garlic & olive oil and is really good.  Ravioli is served in a red sauce w cheese. Eggplant is served w spaghetti in a red sauce. Both the chicken & eggplant parm are very good.  My kiddo loves the penne pasta. It's just penne, sauce and a layer of cheese. I wouldn't go crazy for it, but they love it.    Gourmet Pizzas- delicious. Yes, they're a bit pricier but they are so good. It's hard to say which is best. The loaded veggies and natural cheese are delicious. You have to decide which are your favorite and customize.   Stromboli- love the spinach. I'm stuck on it so I can't say much about the others. Mostly because I can't stop ordering the spinach when we get the Stromboli.",

    "text": "What a strange name - Pizza Care. Does the pizza care and give you a hug or do you care about pizza? Or does it mean the ingredients they use/present appears the company cares about people? Maybe all of the above. I ended up here in the wee hours of the morning after a concert. A slew of people made a walk from Consol to their cars and places. After drinks at the show and a nice walk, there were three of us who were hungry. This place kind of stands alone in between lots/property and is open until 3am Fridays and Saturdays. I'd say this is a plus though I'm not sure how much business they get in those hours and in that area.   They have delivery and a variety of options that would easily appeal to college students (Duquesne, for example). They actually have something called Duquesne Specials with combos available at low prices. The place is well lit and has a large enough seating area. The two gentlemen working behind the counter were nice and recommended a few items to us. We decided on a medium pepperoni pizza between the three of us. It didn't take super long to come out and I thought it was good - not much of a grease factor, which is nice. We ate ours with ranch. The area inside was clean, but I wasn't impressed with the bathroom when I went in to wash my hands. They have the key up front and the door knob was loose/looked like it was about to fall out. It appeared tidy, but the bathroom felt grimy and run down. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here since I don't live nearby, but I wouldn't be opposed to stopping in if I happened to be close and craving pizza.",

The whole wheat bread with the sandwich was either incorrectly made with white bread or a really sad attempt at wheat. $6.50 was too much for the sandwich, but it was edible.  The pizza was awful. The whole wheat crust was dense and noticeably sweet. Completely wrong for good pizza. The sauce wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Toppings were fresh enough, but fontinella cheese was bad choice for half the pizza. The mushroom/spinach slices were better, but still not even up to the level of mediocre. I won't order again, but at least the dog has treats for a few days.   Finally, delivery took more than an hour.",

If you're looking for under-seasoned thick breading, covering also tasteless low quality items, this is the place for you. Nothing is toasted, or crispy. The fried fish came out the same texture as the bread, squishy. The \"marinara sauce \", has never met salt. I suspect it's actually canned crushed tomatoes that has once layed near a rosemary container. That's all the spice that could be detected.  This is one of those places that you order take-out from and then spend 20 minutes in your own kitchen, doctoring the food that you bought so that you wouldn't have to cook.",

In reality, it's an exceptional pizza joint that's actually looking out for your cholesterol levels. Basically healthcare, right?  When I get Pizza Care pizza, I get the spinach and feta pizza on multigrain crust. How often can you get multigrain crust at a divey pizza shop?! Like, never! The crust is nice and thin with a hearty, grainy texture that pairs nicely with the flavors of the pizza. They are liberal with the toppings and feta cheese to the point that you don't notice it's a white pizza. The garlic sauce in lieu of red sauce is mild but flavorful and soaks nicely into the multigrain crust. I highly recommend this pizza if you're trying to treat yo'self while still maintaining a semblance of health in your diet.   My meat-eating friends all RAVE about the buffalo chicken pizza, and I've never experienced a delivery that was late or an order that was incorrect. Pizza Care-s about your experience!",

    "text": "Ordered here for delivery after a friend recommended this place. Prices are reasonable and the food came within reasonable time.   My friends and I ordered an x-large with half sausage and half mushroom, along with 24 garlic parmesan wings. They gave us extra ranch on the side like we asked. However, I was not very impressed with the food. It was definitely not the worst, but it's not the best either. The pizza sauce was a tad too sweet for my liking. The sausage toppings were overcooked and tasted rubbery. The wings were under seasoned and just bland...boring...bleh.   Overall the food here was edible but not my first choice for pizza.",

We came across Pizza Care and decided to give it a try.   I was excited to see whole wheat and multi grain crust options, as well as many vegetarian choices. I ordered a multi grain crust with green pepper, onion, and extra cheese. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken pizza.   First of all, our food was $40. We each got a small pizza and a piece of garlic bread. That is crazy to me. The food was all good, but nothing remarkable. No real complaints... but no real accolades either.   I don't think we will order again. Some of the flavor was just lacking, and especially for that price... our pizza search will continue.",

Their workers are always nice and I'm pretty sure they already know our address by heart. Also, they give you ranch with your pizza without having to ask and it's SO GOOD!",

    "text": "Pizza Care has great pizza! I've tried a couple different pizzas & they've all been really good. I recommend the multi grain crust, it's flavorful, crispy & not too doughy like some pizzas. Also love the side of ranch they give you with the pizza to dip your crust in.  I've also had the veggie & the fish hoagies. The hoagies were ok, nothing special. Not really worth getting, I would stick with their pizzas.  I really like that they are using healthy ingredients. No preservatives or trans fat, use olive oil in their crusts, healthy crust options & their cheese is all natural. I know pizza isn't exactly healthy for you however it's nice to have a healthy choice if you are going to eat pizza once in a while.  Pizza Care is a great addition to the city & I don't believe there's any other pizza shops around Pittsburgh that have these healthy options.",

Unfortunately neither they nor I will be ordering from them in the future. Today I placed an order during the 11 o'clock hour, to be delivered for a lunch meeting at work. Along with the street number, I included the name of the business and the suite number. Once the meeting started I was not available to answer my phone, so I missed the call from the driver. He refused to deliver the food to my suite and instead offered to meet me in the lobby.   I requested a refund since my food was not delivered as requested. The company will instead only deliver the food to me at another time of my choosing. I'm hoping they'll at least remove the 30+ percent tip I'd already added!",

    "text": "Pizza Care is rapidly becoming my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh, mostly because of the flexibility in the menu, including and especially some healthy-ish options.  Want a regular pizza?  You can have it.  Need an on-time order for a large party?  They can handle it.  Want a crazy level of topping customization?  They've yet to mess up one of my orders yet, and I've placed plenty of them.  But what really sets them apart is their insistence that pizza doesn't have to be total junk food.  You can swap the crust for something whole wheat or multi-grain (whole wheat options available for hoagie rolls, pasta, and wraps too); there are tons of viable sauce options; they even have low-fat cheese and gluten-free options for pizza crust and pastas.  Over the past year I've been moving more and more of my pizza business to Pizza Care--at this point they're getting well over 90% of my orders (not counting when I'm traveling).  In my opinion, every city should have at least one or two places like this.",

Sometimes by the time the delivery driver arrives, you want to bite them your so hungry. Lol This place was my first test drive for ordering through Yelp and I was impressed. My order arrived within 35 mins.  We ordered salads and wings (wing dust on half and buffalo on the other). My seafood salad was huge, very fresh and chock full of shrimp, surimi, onions, green peppers, cheese and a good mixture of lettuce. No wet bottom salads here either! It was very good. Did I say it was huge? I still have salad left after eating more for lunch today and will have enough to polish off for lunch tomorrow. 3 meals of salad for 10 bucks....not bad.   The wings were plump and juicy. The wing dust was a bit salty on some pieces but the fix would be to order it on the side. The buffalo sauce was just the right amount of heat and the sauce stuck to the wings well.   The delivery driver was extremely nice making sure I had everything secured so it didn't topple over.  I'm looking forward to trying out some other items on their menu.",
