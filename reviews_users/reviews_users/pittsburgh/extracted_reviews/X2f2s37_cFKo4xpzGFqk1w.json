    "text": "Me and my friend decided to stop by here after a movie at waterfront.  There was so much food, and it was all pretty good--especially the dimsum dishes, and the chinese food. However the sushi had old rice, and fish that was not that fresh, and was weirdly watery.  However, the thing that really killed this place for me was the service. The waitresses were more concerned with flirting with regulars then helping. Literally, they stopped at every table around us to talk, chat within themselves, and basically socialize with everyone aside from us. And when our bill came, they circled our table awkwardly until we paid. We asked them to separate our check, and they only gave us one receipt. Plus they coerced me to pay for my friend's tip bill. The waitress literally wouldn't stop speaking to me in Chinese until I paid for my friend's tip, even though he was about to pay the tip in cash. Not that they really helped us...  Overall, the service just really killed it for me. We were nicely dressed college students, and the service and attitude towards us was so cold, and then straight up rude that I don't want to come back.",

The staples are all there, sushi, snow crab (dinner only), shrimp, Mongolian BBQ, salads, crab rangoon, etc. The usual Chinese fare is pretty good, but I would steer clear of the american dishes (their pizza doesn't taste quite like pizza). The sushi I have found to be simple, but does the job. Don't expect any very fancy rolls.   They have recently added a chocolate fountain to their desert bar, which thankfully means you can get a plate of fruits as well if you prefer.",

The price is not bad for all-you-can-eat (especially crab legs). The food selection is typical: lo mein, rice, chicken with broccoli, general tso, sushi, soups, American (pizza, chicken nuggets), salad, fruit, desserts, ice cream, etc. Some of the male customers pushed female customers out of the way to get to the food, and my big husband had to intervene.",

    "text": "So admittedly, I'm biased.  I love asian food, seafood, and big eating, so I'm naturally inclined to like asian buffets. That said, I think that Hokkaido is by far the best asian buffet in Pittsburgh.  There's 2 things a buffet can offer.  Quantity and quality.  With a full range of over 100 different options including a wide japanese sushi selection, crab legs, tons of great standard Chinese dishes like general tsos and chicken with broccoli and tasty desserts, their selection is as far reaching and as any buffet I've ever seen.  The food is quickly cycled through so it's always reasonably fresh, and the entire restaurant is always immaculately clean, well maintained and fairly stylish.  So they have quantity, but hows the quality?  Basically, it's all tasty and definitely as good as you can possibly expect for the price.  It's not the same gourmet dishes you might get at a high end gourmet restaurants like Little Tokyo in Mt Washington, Jimmy Wans in Fox Chapel, or Umi in Shadyside, but it also doesn't carry their high price tags or limited portions either.  Hokkaido is an AMAZING value, and if after pumping iron in the gym I want to get my protein fix, this is a fun place to make that happen.  Come hungry.  You'll leave full and happy :)",

Good place to experiment on seafood or sushi (had mussels for the first time they were great). It is kind of noisy though. I was kind of annoyed with one of their policies, it stated that if you do not finish your plate (or however they worded it) you would be charged extra. I am already paying for an all you can eat buffet I do not understand why does it matter if my plate is finished or not. Probably just a way to earn extra  money. Regardless its okay I would come again.",

We began our meal at 3:00pm. After 2 hours, a waitress came to us with checking list and forced us to leave. What is unbelievable is that she then explained to us: we are keeping other customers away because of our 2-hour seating and they don't have enough seats. WHAT THE HELL OF THIS HELL!!! We paid $25 in total  (including tips and taxes) but we don't have the right to stay more than 2 hours?? Her way of talking was extremely insulting with an irritating long face. Ironically, we glanced at the lobby when left, there were apparently at least more than half empty seats, ha, a collapse of itself.   This is not the end of the story. Today is new year's eve and we do not want a quarrel, so we just argued about several words while the roll of her eyes toward us would be definitely unforgettable. We were totally un-esteemed! We sincerely hope that Hokkaido can train their staff from the very basic in this coming new year. With ignoring customer service, even monopoly in this district can't help a lot.",

They were delicacies! There were clams, oysters, crab legs, fried crabs, frog legs (which my friend refused to try), chicken feet (I say you try them if you haven't), woodear among many others. There were a few different kinds of dumplings! Only I was too full by the time I discovered them to have the space to try one.  Although I might prefer Tokyo sushi buffet on McKnight over this, Hokkaido wins with its desserts. They have things like coconut rice and different (but not bad) tasting cheesecakes.  Oh my fave thing about Hokkaido? The fact that they charge you $8 if you waste food. Brilliant!! It is depressing to see wasted food and Hokkaido is doing the right thing here!",

    "text": "I used to love this place. The food is acceptable for the price (about $20 for dinner) and the there are a variety of choices.  But the quality of the service is awful. Several weeks ago, we went to the place with one luggage, and there were plenty of seats, but the waitress insisted to take us to the seat at the very corner. She explained that our luggage might block people.  What I did not understand was that we could just put the luggage under a table and it would be impossible to block anyone. I told the waitress what I thought but was refused. The corner seat was apparently an overkill since barely nobody even the waitress came there; also the light is dim, the distance is far from all the food.  The most important thing is that, the waitress's attitude was not polite at all. She was impatient with a long face. If she could just explain a little more with even a little smile on her face, I would probably accept the arrangement.  Another time, I went there with my girlfriend. There was only one person at the front desk and she was lowering her head and busy with something. So we went straight inside, trying to find a waitress to take us. We did not find any, so my girlfriend took a seat and I returned to the front desk. The waitress named Maggie at the front desk told us never enter the room without a waitress. This was reasonable to me - the problem was Maggie's attitude was so rude that I just could not control my temper and had a big quarrel with her and after that, we left without having the dinner. Maggie's point is fine, but her way of talking to us was very insulting and uncivil.  Monopoly is bad, this place is the nearest to my neighborhood, and other seafood buffet is far and inconvenient to go without a car. The management team of this place should focus more on the service quality.",

I am a big fan of the snow crab legs (dinner only), Mongolian BBQ, crab rangoon, spare ribs (they have these only once and a while) and fried shrimp.  They have a few different chicken dish options that are alright also.  There is also a pretty large sushi selection though I don't eat it my husband is a fan and says that the quality is pretty good.   Their dessert selection is pretty good with at least five flavors of hard scoopable ice cream, cheesecake, puddings, jello, flan like custard, and recently a chocolate fountain with fresh fruit and rice crispy treats for dipping.   Overall this is not a place to look for a gourmet meal, but if you are in the mood for some crabs legs and some decent sushi it will definitely hit the spot.",

I think they might be ninjas.  One second you are sitting there and the next the appear out of nowhere...it's mind boggling.  The buffet itself has everything from hot to cold.  I feel as if I'm browsing the shelves at a market somewhere deciding if I really need that item or not.  Doesn't matter, I put it on my plate, if I don't like it, no worries.  Of course being a Chinese style buffet they have my favorite (a probably a lot of other people's favorite), General Tso's.  I always end up getting way to much at a buffet and end up leaving as if I just ate Thanksgiving dinner.  You know, unbutton the pants, and then sit back for a nap type of feeling.  Seafood salad, General Tso's, garlic sting beans, honeydew, sushi, won ton soup, and to finish it off, some ice cream.  Happy as a clam sums it up.  However, I'm still weirded out by the chicken feet...o.O",

There's a pretty large sushi roll selection as well as your typical buffet dinner options, ie chinese food options, Hibachi corner, and dessert station.   The ice cream doesn't seem old like some buffets in town. The servers are really good at clearing your table so that you can make space for more plates!! Parking is never a problem for dinner since most businesses next door are closing.   The hibachi area is fairly quick and they are good to ask if I want a soy sauce base or teriyaki base.   It's a little loud at dinner time, since there's a lot going on, but I love that I can take my 17 mo. daughter here and she can scream without having people stare at us. :)",

The salad section doesnt look like it gets too picked out with all the raw stuff over there. people tend to stay away from that area.    the main dishes section always has an array of different types of chicken, noodles, beef, and fish that make your mouth water.  dont really go to the hibachi cause i hate waiting but i have seen people getting food there and it looks like they know what there doing. also next to the hibachi they have a peeking duck that is to die for. very sweet and tender.  the appetizer section with the egg rolls and chicken on a stick is pretty dope. my favorite is the sesame balls. very doughy and good.  the fruit and desert bar had a recent additon....a chocolate fondue fountain! i feel bad for those people that gotta scrape the chocolate that almost becomes like cement when it goes on the plate.  and when it comes to the ice cream section.... COTTON CANDY ICE CREAM AND COFFEE ICE CREAM...what could be better?",

Shame on me for going on an off hour. The soups had skin on them, the shrimp was cold and mushy, and all the sushi had been sitting. NONE of the hot food was hot. Think this place is good when it's packed because it means the food is continuously replenished. It's not really right that I paid the price for a VERY substandard experience - they should close in between meals if they can't maintain quality.",

Part of the problem is that I don't tend to have a huge appetite - BUT I've noticed that if the food is excellent I suddenly have the room to gorge myself on the deliciousness. I've decided that my appetite is a great measuring stick for buffet food quality - and my appetite says that Hokkaido is wonderful!  Note: this is not a Chinese/Japanese specific buffet. It has a lot of the Chinese buffet staples, from the chicken based dishes to the mixed veggies to noodles to the awesome little dessert cakes and pudding - but it also has sushi. Really, really good sushi. All of the stuff here was fresh when I visited and a lot of the items varied between being BBQed, cooked or fried, depending on what was being made and offered that day. There's also few stations where you can customize your own meal, too, i.e. the Mongolian grill, Hibachi, etc.  My point? There's definitely something here to please everyone. I can't even REMEMBER all of the awesome food I've enjoyed here, that's how varied the selection was and is. Plus the place overall just felt warm, inviting and well maintained. Just a fantastic place to splurge. I'd come back in a heartbeat!",

Because Hokkaido is supposedly the \"best\" one in Pittsburgh. Based on that statement alone, you can understand my sense of caution. I've been to plenty of asian buffets around the world. Hokkaido isn't bad, I've just had better. There's a good variety of chinese dishes, mongolian grill, sushi, dim sum, fruits, desserts and crab legs.  My only problem is the cleanliness. You're probably asking, what do you expect from a buffet? Hand sanitizer pumps around the area, maybe? Clean dishes? Clean eating utensils? Clean serving spoons/tongs?   I also witnessed a kid hanging over the freezer to get ice cream. Then he stuck his fingers in the scooper to scrape it out. Then dropped it back in the water. One employee saw but didn't care. I don't know where this kids fingers have been? Not only that but the dishes were slightly greasy and some of my eating utensils had sweet and sour sauce residue on it. Bathroom was a bit of a mess. Old rags under the soap dispenser and paper towels all over the floor. Maybe it was a bad day?  At least the restaurant didn't smell. So that's a plus!  Food was good Cleanliness could be far better Service was as good as it can be Price is a little expensive",

The waitress asked my old daughter to stand up, and told me they would charge her as an adult, because she is tall. I paid for my two daughters in full price because my two daughters have almost same height.  This is the first time my daughters were charged as adult, not only in restaurant, in every place we have been to. I asked my old daughter, how tall she is in her class. She told me she is one of the shortest students.   So, if you have a kid that is 8 and above, do not be surprised if they charge him/her as an adult.",

The food is VERY low quality and even if it was once good quality, they sit everything out so long on the buffet it gets rubbery and has a weird taste to it. My husband and I had an oyster (which we typically love) and we both spit it out because it was chewy/rubbery and had a skunky taste. Like, they left it out in the sun and forgot to refrigerate it. Alot of the seafood tasted like this. Especially the sushi. i'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from the sushi- or it may have been that oyster - :/. I went home with my stomach really hurting and the next morning I woke up with nausea/diarrhea. I highly regret my decision to go there. Really though, I'm warning you. Don't go there unless you want to spend the whole next day in the bathroom.",

And he said it angrily. I was angry by this because I was on vacation in Pittsburgh, and I didn't even live there! It was actually my first time coming to Hokkaido! If they recognize me, and if they're angry about it, why don't they keep it to themselves?  I was very upset while eating my food. I don't even think they deserve one star.

There was just about any item you could find at a Chinese restaurant on buffet and there was also a hibachi which was cool. You are only asked to take what you'll eat and you'll be charged extra for tossing food which is an amazing idea! We are all too wasteful in general. The pricing was a little deceptive. They asked what we would like to drink assuming it was included in the buffet, but it was not. So expect another $3/drink.",

I know people do waste a lot of food at buffets, but it is not welcoming to be threatened with being charged for unfinished food.  It is a buffet and sometimes I take things to try that I absolutely don't like.  I'm not going to eat them just because of your threats!    I was in the area and convinced my husband that we should finally try this buffet.  It was a Friday night and while it was crowded, it wasn't overwhelmingly so as the tables are well spaced out.  I was in the mood for sushi so I started there.  There were about 10 types of rolls, four of five types of pieces and four types of sashimi.  They also had the sauces to add if you wanted to.   None of the rolls or pieces I ate were out of this world or extremely memorable, but they were tasty.  Most had at least one type of sauce on them, though, so if you aren't a fan of sauce on your rolls, you won't like this sushi.  Aside from the sushi, they also have a selection of the typical Chinese buffet fair.  My husband tried a good number of those dishes and again said they were tasty but nothing overly memorable.  They did have a few dim sum options which was a nice touch.  Overall, it was pricey (around $20 per person) but if you went somewhere else and got an appetizer, salad, entrees and dessert, you would be paying at least that if not more.",

Having being spoiled by Sushi Palace and other all you can eat sushi establishments in New Jersey, Hokkaido was several levels below par. The clean plates at the counter were not completely clean, and looked like they were somewhat greasy. A few times, I even saw an employee push a garbage can full of trash past the buffet counter, and made everything look unappetizing after that.

    "text": "SETTING: Clean and open space. Multiple tables to seat small or big parties. Quite expansive buffet that ran along the back wall of the restaurant.  FOOD: Was in the area for lunch and had an Asian food hankering. All I knew was 1) Me hangry, and, 2) Want something Asian, but didn't have a specific asian cuisine in mind. After zero thought process, I decided to go for the shotgun approach. Asian lunch buffet, I'm coming for ya.  There was a little bit of everything at Hokkaido. It's not a Japanese buffet as the name may seem to suggest. It was a pan-Asian buffet that served sushi, seafood, dim sum, noodles, meat, dessert. We all know that a buffet is usually quantity over quality. So no particular knock on Hokkaido, but I got what I expected: a sampling of your typical Westernized Asian fare. Don't expect anything fancy or traditional, this is a buffet...you get the Westernized \"favorites\" (ie: california roll, general tso's, chow mein, etc). Oh, and if you need some good 'ol traditional American delicacies to add to the mix, you can pick up some pizza, soup, and salad.  For buffet standards, the sushi was decent (I was scared to try the raw fish because I wasn't sure how fresh it was...that's just me). Seafood was fine (mussels, squid, etc). Not the freshest, but tasty enough. Chinese food was what you would expect from a fast food Chinese joint. It was one of those days where I just wanted to stuff my face with all kinds of asian food and wasn't so picky, so I was satisfied--minus the grease stain I left on my shirt.    SERVICE: Minimal but attentive, which is what I would expect at a buffet because you help yourself. They take away your old plates and refill your drinks quickly.    IMPRESSIONS: I left Hokkaido with one hand over my stomach from over-eating (3 plates in 30 minutes! Ugh!), and another hand holding a slightly stale creampuff. I probably muttered something the lines of \"never again,\" but that's too bold of a statement to be of any value. But $10 for a lunch buffet...now that's value, even if it is Westernized Asian food.",

And when they do have crab legs , they are so small and smell like they are rotten (crab legs are my favorite and the ones they put out are disgusting, they should be embarrassed ) and what about the people who don't eat crab legs (either because there aren't any available or don't like them? ) They still get charged like $20 a person for a Chinese buffet. They are ripping people off! It's ridiculous. We won't be back.",

    "text": "This is a buffet, so if you are unfamiliar with the concept or dining style, it may be a bit much for the generic American food eater. By this I mean, this is an Asian styled buffet, with combinations and flavors that may not appeal to everyone. I personally enjoy every visit here and haven't been disappointed in over a dozen visits in the past, but as its a buffet I tend to visit during volume hours for a larger and fresher selection.   Yes, it's wise to come here when you're starving and it doesn't hurt to have an open mind on food. Bland isn't really a flavor here. My companion always judges Asian buffets by the quality of the chicken feet, myself the frogs legs. Hokkaido doesn't carry frog legs and the chicken feet were cold, almost pickled, but enjoyed. Plenty of the other food was delicious, the selection gigantic, and the buffet was kept quite clean.   Small secret. It seems they may not label everything on purpose. Perhaps that's because the staff hardly acknowledges the ability to speak English. Perhaps it's to the benefit of the educated diner. I scored some red clam sashimi, salmon skin maki, bean stuffed buns, and something I still don't know what it was. The crab legs were actually delicious, the maki/sushi was freshly prepared, the octopus salad always scrumptious. It always seems like the generic American foods suffer but I know nothing of this. I did not come here eat garlic bread, corn dogs, pizza, or chicken quesadilla.   So sure, it's a buffet, but it has plenty of eclectic dishes. If you're in the mood for an Asian food buffet, there's plenty to cram in your belly here. So yes, four stars, amongst its contemporaries this place shines",

There is a lot of quality seafood but what really got me down was the presentation which was like a lunch line in high school. The dessert section also put a damper on the whole buffet for me. I love, love a good dessert selection and on first glance it was impressive, a fondue fountain, strange fruits, flan.  The fondue fountain was gross, I have no idea what kind of chocolate they put in it but this couldn't count as chocolate.  The flan was way too sweet, I couldn't even stomach it...  The sushi selection was also really sad. Not enough variety and not enough quality.",

It got to a point where we had to ask the host to stop staring at us while we ate, then she went on to say \"I don't understand\". worst place every! plus there is a sign on the table we later noticed that said if you do not finish your food they will charge 8$  per plate to your bill! crazy right!

They have a large section of Americanized Chinese food (steamed fish, General Tso's chicken, squid, noodles, fried dumplings, etc) and a smaller one of American food (wings, fries, sausage, etc.). Avoid their \"dim sum\" section. Taste was a bit off. Surprisingly, their cold seafood/salad section was interesting (i.e. squid, clams, seaweed etc.). Not too sure about the freshness but definitely had a lot of variety.   As far as buffets go, Hokkaido isn't one of the best, but at least it fills you up and you can taste about a hundred different things in one night. 2 stars for doing its job as a buffet.",

So my bf and I came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty crowded. Not too too crowded where you have to wait your turn to get food or when the food runs out and you have to wait for it to be replaced. I've been to the Hokkaido in Long Beach, CA and this was pretty similar to that one. They had a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi (salmon, octopus, and something else I forget). There was lots of steamed crab legs that never ran out and some pretty (unusually) huge cooked clams. See my photo. They were huge! The food was good and the buffet was clean. However, the service was spectacular! The waitresses were extremely nice and always had a smile on their face, which was a pleasant change from the typical Asian buffets where the waitresses seam to dislike taking the plates off your table.  Dessert selection okay. I did like how they had about 8 different ice cream self-serve flavors. The other desserts didn't really stand out to me. The only downside to the dessert section was the chocolate fountain. The bottom level... um... seemed murky (kinda like the dirty water that gets caught in the side of a lake) and definitely needed to be changed. Let's just say I did not touch that chocolate fountain.  Other than that, I had a good dinner. Only wished I could fit more in my stomach :)",

There is a very wide selection of food. My favorite part was the sushi bar--they had lots of different kinds of sushi and selections of sashimi as well.  Dessert was alright--they offered some fruit/fruit salads, ice cream, and cake. To my surprise, they also had white fungus bird's nest soup, a lightly sweetened soup with a slightly syrupy consistency that my mom often made for me at home. It was really refreshing to see something like that in Pittsburgh. There is a chocolate fountain as well, but the chocolate tastes more like Hershey's syrup than actual chocolate and has a grainy texture, so I wasn't a huge fan of it. Still cool, though.",

I came to the burgh in 2000 and couldn't for the life of me find a decent Chinese buffet! They were all pretty disgusting. I was so excited when I saw they were opening up a new one at the Waterfront. Party because it will make my weekly trips to Target that much better!   I should say that it's not only a Chinese buffet, but also serves sushi as well! I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I've ever had, but you watch them making it in front of you, so you at least know it's fresh. I look for very certain things in my Chinese buffets, which I think you all should. Cleanliness, fresh looking and selection. I feel like they have it all. They have a large selection of sushi, fried food (who doesn't love cheese wonton's!) and traditional Chinese. They also have a Mongolian BBQ where you can make your own plate of raw food an they cook it in front of you. It's pretty tasty, and I try to convince myself that's the healthy way to go (even though I know it's not!).   The buffet is pricey at $18 but you can catch the lunch specials, which is around $10. And totally unrelated to Chinese, they have this cotton candy ice cream that is beyond amazing! Look for the rainbow looking one! Delish!",

As someone who loves salmon sashimi though, the lack of subtle flavor - or any flavor, really - in it was a bit disappointing. The ones in the \"salmon and avocado roll\" tasted great though, and the other rolls were interesting as well. The \"stuffed mushrooms\" had what looked like a biscuit as part of it, but turned out to have an odd, cheesy foam taste. The mini cakes were mostly dry and tasteless, but the egg pudding and coconut tapioca pudding were good.  Service was great, with all plates quickly cleared.",

Some \"hot\" food I get, especially the chicken, is usually hot on the outside and raw on the inside. The seafood options here aren't standouts either. Most of it is low-quality and no one bothers to really debone the salmon - two things I really wish they'd change but don't.

    "text": "What happened to my boyfriend and me was unbelievable!!! The waitress called Maggie with two handful hairs on each side of her forehead(60's hairstyle) is very disgusted. When we enter the shop, there's no one leading us. So I asked my boyfriend to wait beside the front door to wait a waitress to serve us and I went inside and picked a preferred seat (If there's a fault, maybe it's that I did not wait with my bf together). However, for any waitress with any quality, she should never ever roll her eyes toward us and reprimand us seriously like we are the thieves or freeloaders, which makes us feel too bad!!!  This is not the end of the story! When we said that we want to see the boss and complain about Maggie, a polite and experienced waitress talked to us. We felt better because of her soft tone but she never asked what we want (need an apology or something else to compensate). She just said that THE BAD ATTITUDE OF MAGGIE IS BECAUSE OF HER BAD MOOD TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AND without any apology, just asked us(seeming nothing happened before) WHETHER TO EAT OR NOT?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT THE HELL OF THIS HELL???!!!!!!!!!!WE ARE TOTALLY IGNORED AND UN-ESTEEMED!!!!!NO ONE CARES WHAT WE FEEL!!!!  Both of my bf and I are not good at having quarrel with others. We did not continue speaking with the waitresses but left with lots of anger and disappointment. We hope that no one else would go through what we did and we sincerely hope the quality of service in Hokkaido could be promoted by expending more training cost for the waitresses.   NO MAGGIE-STYLE WAITRESS ANY MORE!!!",

    "text": "This place was pretty interesting!  In a good way, though!  PRICING:  We (the 2 of us) went on a Friday Night @ approx 7:30 and the check was just shy of $40.  The buffet is pretty huge with TONS of different and unique dishes on it.   From Chicken Feet (yep... the claws!) to Sushi!  There were a lot of traditional Chinese dishes (such as Lo Mein, Rice Noodles, Rice Dishes, General Tso's, etc.), but there were also some wild ones like Squid!  The do have crab legs on the buffet (as well as 1/2 crabs).  Lots of fruit and ice cream flavors at the dessert station. There's even a hibachi station!  Okay, so the breakdown:  PROS:   LOTS of food options; Food was kept pretty fresh and plentiful; Food was hot! We were seated very quickly on a Friday night; the wait staff were on the ball when it came to refills and pre-busing the tables.  CONS: Bathroom attention needed to be a bigger priority; The only thing that they did NOT have on the buffet that I wish they did have was regular old Fried Rice!  lol, c'mon now!  How do ya not have that?!??  lol  All in all, it was a good experience! We'll be back and I think that we definitely got our money's worth.",

The shells break as they should, and the meat comes out in one piece, the sign of proper cooking.  Other places the meat falls apart and the shell is squishy - overcooked.  Many delicious staples, including a huge sushi section which is not my thing, but heard great things.  The real marker of a good asian buffet is my observation of the patrons - we were there on a busy Saturday night, and I looked around and noticed more than 2/3rds of the customers were Asian.  Never in my life saw that at another Chinese buffet.  That speaks for itself, and speaks volumes - this food is the real deal!",

    "text": "As far as a Chinese buffet is concerned I could recommend this place. Maybe one of the best in Pittsburgh but nothing to hoot and holler about. Most of the food was tasty while some of it was dry. Perhaps dry because there were only about 15 people there on a Monday night around 7. Wait staff was friendly and diligent enough to be happy about the service. The restaurant was clean as well. I live in a different state and the city (Houston) is home to a large Asian population and have had the pleasure of some real good food. Overall if you are craving a Chinese buffet this is a good place to try. However, I would not say the food lives up to the price tag at dinner prices. $18 - $20 per person plus drinks.",

Unfortunately I do not have any medals above my bed...YET. This is where I go to train.  There is a 20 dollar fee to train here, well worth it. First I start off with 10 reps of the king crab legs. It's a great warm up, gets the heart going and the fingers nimble. I follow this up with a few randoms, couple reps of sweet and sour chicken, bourbon chicken, and general tsos.  After this I like to go for a cool down, or what I like to call, the first desert. Maybe some ice cream, banana cream pudding, something like that.  I like to follow up my first desert with some mercury intake. Sushi does the trick. I don't go too crazy with this, like to keep my figure.  Then I go big. The mongolian barbecue. This is where I build the stomach muscle. Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops and I even saw shark here one time.   After my stomach has stretched to new heights I like to finish off with my final cool down, some marshmallows run through the chocolate fountain.  Is this the best training facility in the world? Probably not. Does it have some good crab legs and mongolian bbq? Absolutely  Also, like other people said, dont leave too much food on your plate or they will charge you extra.",

    "text": "So unfortunately the sushi buffet on McKnight road closed, which was my favorite place ever. This is my first visit to Hokkaido and I'm so happy I went! I really wish this place was closer to me, but it was worth the hour drive to brace rush hour and get there for dinner.   I really went for the sushi, and sushi I ate! The selection is good, and as far as buffet sushi goes this is some of the best. I only wish their pieces were larger and thicker, but the taste was great! I'm very happy that they had nigiri, sashimi and rolls.   Do yourself a favor and have some crab legs! Usually I'm shocked at people eating mountains of crab legs at a buffet because in my experience they are always rather salty, not so fresh, and the shells are mush. Not so here! These crab legs were actually really good!!! The shell broke easily and the butter was even tasty, which to me is a must. I was there during dinner hours and there were quite a few people eating the crab legs which meant that they kept bringing out small batches so that they were always fresh and hot!   The beef wonton soup was delicious - so flavorful that salt wasn't necessary. As far as the other hot items go I didn't sample much - a few pork dumplings and cheese wontons but everything looked to be mediocre buffet standards.   Final say: if you're going for sushi or crab legs then you will feel like you definitely got your money's worth and then some! If you're planning on loading up on fried foods and standard Asian fare I'd recommend an actual restaurant where the taste will be better.",

    "text": "I've wanted to go here for so long and loved it! Many friends of mine have raved about this place and now I know why.   The manager took us to our table and clarified the price with us--Apparently, a lot of people are surprised to learn that the buffet is more expensive on the weekends than during the week and have been disgruntled in the past. I consider myself a buffet pro and know that yes, of course the price is going to be more expensive on a Sunday afternoon than on a weekday afternoon. That's the way of the world, folks! Regardless, I thought it was great of him to respond to customer complaints and make sure that clarification was made before we were seated. It was $19.99 per person, but let me tell you---- it's an amazing deal for what you get!!!  The food is split up into sections and each one had abundant options. Fried foods, salad bar, dessert, made-to-order hibachi, BBQ/Meat, and then a section which was a great mix of American-Chinese food and authentic Asian options. You'll find the typical buffet fare of wontons, spring rolls, general tso's chicken, coconut shrimp, fried rice, etc. But don't worry if you are looking for something a little more adventurous! There was fried chicken feet, octopus salad, kimchi and other fare that you don't seen at most Asian buffets.   I was most looking forward to this place because of what I've heard about their sushi/sashimi selection. And I was not disappointed! I'd say there were about 10 different types of rolls in addition to the sashimi. The rolls were fresh and plentiful. The tempura rolls were still crispy, which is almost unheard of in buffet-style serving.   I had to sample a little from each section and after three plates, I was incredibly full and satisfied!  They also have a hibachi style section where you can create your own dish to be cooked to order. I was far too full to mess with that section, but I appreciate it's availability, especially for those who might be pickier eaters than me.",

I will say that there is a language barrier from the staff and they are on top of you to pick your plate up and refill your cup.

    "text": "This place is always packed on weekends. I feel like every time I come here, there is at least a 15 minute wait before they let me in. For only $17.99 a person and the endless rows of yummy in your tummy food, Hokkaido is definitely worth the wait.   The atmosphere at Hokkaido is very upbeat and dynamic. There is always some type of party taking place in the buffet. Today there was an engagement party so the place was filled with balloons and confetti. Endless selection of food...all tasted amazing! I love the pepper shrimps and stir fry mushrooms. However, crab legs were kind of scrawny and there weren't that many variety of sushi/sashimi. Oysters though...definitely endless! I think between my boyfriend and me, we had like at least 10 plates of oysters, and they just kept refilling them until we finally surrendered.   Service was okay. I was kind of annoyed that the waitress gave us the check so early, when we weren't even close to getting dessert yet. I know there are other people waiting, but there is no need to rush us like that. No worries, we took our good old time anyways.   In conclusion, Hokkaido is good for everything, except for the crab legs. Sushi/sashimi were ok, but if you're only in it for the sushi/sashimi, then Tokyo Sushi Buffet is a better choice. However, if you're in it for all the variety of food, then I highly recommend Hokkaido!",

The crab is not fresh and overcook... however it provides a variety of food, including Chinese food, habachi, Hong Kong dim sum, western food, and chocolate fountain!! The food I think it's ok are Chinese food, sushi, and chocolate fountain. They said for the dinner, they will provide other kind of crab and oysters which cost you around 18$. You can give it a try since it's so cheap... if you want drinks, it will cost you extra (2$ for coke)...",

Decent selection of sashimi.    Went for dinner - $50 with drinks - not bad but as stated, the sushi was the only think worth going back for.   They did have crab/crab legs that were good - how can you really screw up crab legs?   I would recommend the spicy beef & teriyaki chicken sticks but didn't really like any of the other dishes. General Tsos Chicken tasted more like sweet and sour sauce with hot peppers thrown in.    I will say that we went during the week at about 8:00 (2 hours before close).  Maybe they \"step-up their game\" during the weekend.   Also - its not the cleanest place.  Tables were clean but the rest of the place could use a good scrub down.  I guess I may have expected too much from a buffet place.    All that said - doubt I would go back.",

They were large, easy to crack open and not swimming in a foot of salty water like other buffets.  I'm not a sushi person, but from what I saw, they had a nice variety.  The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the service, which is just what I expected from reading the reviews before I went yesterday.  They just walk by and grab plates.  I had to ask several times before I finally got crab claw crackers, I gave up and went to them for extra napkins and we had to stop her just to get refills on our drinks.

It was difficult even to pluck any healthful-looking pieces of broccoli out of the chicken and broccoli dish. The atmosphere of the restaurant made us feel that we were in hell. As there is no carpeting or insulation, the restaurant is extremely noisy. Tables are close together and it is impossible to converse with one's companions without yelling. We were seated right next to a large party whose vocal infant was within twelve inches of us. We eventually were able to escape to a booth where we were a bit closer to enjoying a meal in a civilized atmosphere. We will not return.",

But Hokkaido Buffet was not very good and was a lot more expensive.  It was $10 for each of our Five year old sons that never finish their plates.  It's was $20 a person for us and the sushi smelled like fish which was disappointing. No one maned the Habachi Grill.  Even the lo mein seemed a little off from usual Chinese style. The chocolate fountain was huge and very nice, but no strawberries for it.  The wait staff was very promote and very nice.  The host desk was very kind also.  We do not like or eat crab legs but they did have them on the buffet, but they are not all you can eat.  Also, if you do not eat all the food on your plate, you will be charged an $8 fee for wasting food on top of you $20 per person price.  I think next time we are in the area, PF Chang's would be a much better option for less money.  Their kids dishes definitely do not cost $10 for a five year old. I would say the best thing to eat here at Hokkaido would be the Chicken Quesadilla, Watermelon, the Serbert ice cream.  Which is disappointing for a Asian Buffet.  Hope this review is an insight to someone.  For those on this thread that lived this place, check out the Fortune Buffet in Monroeville and PF Chang's in homestead you will clearly see the difference!  The hostess was awesome and gave our boys balloons that was kind",

    "text": "I have to update my review because Hokkaido really stepped up their sushi game and I am digging it!    They finally added the basic sushi pieces - salmon, tuna, mackerel, etc. in addition to the rolls they always had.  The fish on top of the rice might've been sliced a little thin but it was very good and fresh - especially the salmon.  I love all the seafood they have - especially since it's Friday during Lenten season.  We had baby clams, cheesy stuffed mussels, salt and pepper squid, shrimp and crab.  I also have to say the eggplant in garlic sauce was super.  Everything was so good - can't wait to come again when I need my sushi fix!  My sister, who was hungover, said this place \"saved her life\" - so dramatic but there is a ring of truth to this - when you want sushi - this place delivers just that and more.  Thanks for upping your sushi game, Hokkaido!! I'm now a big fan :-)",

    "text": "This place used to be my favorite, but they've gotten so stingy over the years that it's really not that fun anymore.   They have a very strict crab leg limit for dinner. You may only get crab legs once during your visit and there is a 7 piece limit. This results in people (understandably) picking the biggest pieces out and what remains are scraps that the restaurant won't refill until they are gone. The crab legs themselves are not the highest quality, so you frequently get pieces with very little meat in them.   Also, the dessert bar has dwindled significantly. It used to be full of different kinds of cookies and cakes. Now, there was a watered down chocolate fountain with marshmallows, peanut brittle, and a brown banana for dipping, a couple of other treats, and ice cream.   The other food is still tasty, but It's just not what it used to be. I understand crab legs are expensive, but I'd rather them raise their prices by a few dollars per person and keep the high quality and enjoyable experience than keep prices the same and make it seem so miserly.",

We tolerated as best as we could, and at the end left a tip which I thought was appropriate for her service. She takes the payment and walks away in disgust. She comes back when we were ready to leave and throws the empty bill holder on the table. I pretended I didnt notice (not to make a scene) but what she was indicating was she wanted a better tip. And she stood there in front of the guests upset. I was shocked by her behavior and I did not want to make a scene so we left. I thought the food was good but because of the service I will never return again and will let everyone know. The manager needs to train their staff. If they are looking for a good tip, they need to provide excellent service.",

Everything we ate tasted fresh, and was well flavored, which is not an easy balance for buffet style service.   And yes, while technically a \"chain\" restaurant it's nice to have an option besides the franchises at the Waterfront in this part of town. I also appreciate the signs on the table warning against wasting food and asking patrons to only take as much as they will eat. It was a subtle reminder that just because this is an \"All You Can Eat\" establishment, it's not a challenge. Take as much as you want, but don't be wasteful--important message!",

Hokkaido does Chinese buffets right and honestly, it's the best I've found in Pittsburgh. The price is on par with most buffets in the area, but I try to catch their lower lunch prices (about $10) whenever possible.   As a vegetarian, this place is a gold mine. Probably one of the only Chinese buffets that have such a wide selection of vegetarian entrees and even tofu. I'm also obsessed with their sushi layout. For the vegheads, they usually have a veggie roll along with tamago sushi and tofu pockets. Why pay $3 for each at other sushi places when I can come here and pound 50 of them in one sitting?   Customer service has always been friendly and efficient. Basically, you blink and your dirty plates are gone.   Thank you Hokkaido for being one of the few Chinese buffets that doesn't give me food poisoning afterwards. I will be back for much more - more than I'll be proud to admit.",

It was my birthday and I chose this restaurant based on local reviews and mostly because I thought it was a \"seafood\" buffet as written in the title. The seafood was not edible. Soft shell crab was boiled and the meat inside was literally grayish/brown. It look awful. It was clear the other dishes had been sitting for a while as most things were sticking the the bottom of the pan. We should have left at that moment but we didn't. I did like the sweet and sour chicken but they were out of sweet and sour sauce and I asked the cook for more and he literally told me NO. He said \"no more sauce.\" Our waitress had to get into a fight with him for more sauce and by that time I was afraid to eat it! Also a note sits at the table that you will be charged an additional 8$ for not finishing your plate. The food was not edible and the sushi was not cold. I am not a waster of food but I had to spit it out. Abysmal birthday meal. So sorry I ever chose this place and so sorry we stayed. My dog could have cooked me a better dinner! Don't eat there...",

You can also fill this to the brim with whatever tasty morsel that fits your fancy. All together, I wager you can get a good 3 lb of food crammed into that box for $9.62.  I got mostly pupus and some noodles. But you could easily squeeze ALOT of sushi into this box. At least 30 pieces. Giant Eagle will charge you like 10 bucks for about 10 pieces or so.

There's a wide variety of Asian and American foods, although somewhat surprisingly (given the name) it's rather weak in the Japanese/Sushi selection.  One thing that bothers me a bit about Hokkaido is the atmosphere. It's a slightly creepy vibe like a 1960's school cafeteria. And a few items I've had there on occasion were just not very good, for instance hot crabs on the buffet that reeked of ammonia when cracked open. But that's the exception, fortunately, not the rule. There are always plenty of good things to eat, although not many wonderful things to eat. In my opinion, Hokkaido ranks as #3 in Pittsburgh Asian buffets, below Tokyo in the North Hills and Misaki on Rt 51. OK for lunch or dinner, and the price is fair, but I wouldn't take a date or out of town visitors there.",

We ended up being charged $17.99 each. ALSO, when it came time for the checks, the waitress, Joyce, stood around while each of us signed our receipts, and went around and checked each of our receipts (all 7 of us) to see how much we tipped. If she noticed someone did not add a tip on their receipt (most of us were planning on using cash) she commented that that price of the buffet did not include the tip. Then, she collected our receipts and stood at the table next to us for about 5 or so minutes to wait and see who was putting cash down. She was huffing and putting the whole time. Terribly rude.",

But if you are into clams and crab legs, they got that stuff too. Also, the desserts were quite nice as well. It is rare for a buffet to have cheesecake, but they did. Service was non-existent (not one re-fill!) and the hostess who seated us was rude. They need to work on that.  Word must have gotten out because the wait times can be enormous for dinner. We had to wait nearly 40 minutes for a table.  Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 5 Stars Relative Price = 5 Stars Service = 0 Stars Experience with Staff = 0 Stars Decor = 3 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes",

I was impressed by the clean interior and then the wide selection of food. It might not be as wide a selection as sushi buffets in new york but it was plenty for me and after 3+ plates I still wasn't able to try everything I wanted to! The food was all fresh and delicious and at such reasonable prices.   I left with a full belly and a huge grin on my face.",

    "text": "Post-Thanksgiving meal planning is a tough task.  You've got a house full of guests, each with his/her own culinary quirks (the snooty foodie, the ethnic restaurant authenticity police, the cheapskate, the unadventurous picky-eater who finds chop suey too exotic, the militant vegan, and the long-suffering mother); the only thing everyone can agree on is: No more leftover turkey!  This would be a good time to pack everyone into the car and head out to Hokkaido Seafood Buffet.  To Asian food aficionados, Hokkaido Seafood Buffet may look kinda sketchy -- being sandwiched between a Dunkin Donuts and an IHOP in a divvy strip-mall, its location does not exactly screams \"oishii!\" Its very buffet-ness also induces skepticism -- good food and buffet are so very often mutually exclusive.  All the same, curiosity got the better of us, and so we find ourselves in Hokkaido Seafood Buffet this Saturday post Thanksgiving.  The name of the restaurant is somewhat misleading. There's nothing particularly Japanese about this place. It is really set up to cater to Americans and Chinese. The food offerings run the gamut from pizza to pig's ears and chicken feet. They do have vegetarian fares, and you will also find dimsum-y snacks, Korean pancakes, chow mein, fruit, ice cream, and, of course, sushi.   The qualities of these dishes vary. The dimsum-y dumplings are probably your best bet (though the wrappers are too thick). The noodle and mongolian bbq station is also a nice touch. The sushi offerings are ok (for buffets) if quantity is more important to you than quality.  Summary: Food-wise, HSB probably only warrants a 3 stars, but I'm giving it an extra 0.5 star for its wide cuisine coverage and another 0.5 star for providing a compromise to a group of diverse eaters.",

We got there around 5 so it wasn't very busy yet. The interior was trendy and clean for the most part- a few booths looked a bit tattered, but we got a nice one right near the crab legs. We dug in immediately trying little bites of absolutely everything. I thoroughly enjoyed most of my choices- everything was very fresh and full of flavor. I tried a few items that just didn't taste good, but they were either too spicy or not something I would normally eat. However, I tried the octopus salad and the tako sushi and loved them both. $17 dollars is a decent price, but keep in mind you're still eating at an Asian buffet. It's not fancy and it's not mind blowing. We definitely be going again, but we'll go early for lunch.",

    "text": "I had avoided Hokkaido since it opened for two main reasons -- 1) their logo makes it looks like a laundromat, and I don't like the idea of eating seafood at a laundromat; 2) I have a a general distrust of seafood this far inland, especially in 'all you can eat' quantities, and most especially at a laundromat.  My boyfriend and I wanted to get sushi tonight, though, so turned to Yelp for ideas of where to do this.  Hokkaido scored high in the results, making this officially the first time Yelp has let me down.  And it not only just let me down, but also helped lead me to a general feeling tonight of wanting to give up on life after a meal there.  We started with the sushi.  I'm certainly not a sushi aficionado, but even I know that sushi is not supposed to be so... chewy.  I don't even really know what more to say about it. I tried a stuffed clam and stuffed shrimp as well, and with both, the stuffing was pretty tasteless and just came off in a clump, leaving me with sad looking pieces of fish, that were, once again, really really chewy.   I'd been pretty excited about the crab legs, as I'm not terribly picky about those, so it's hard to let me down there.  Ultimately, they were fine... somewhat run-of-the-mill, but at least similar in quality to any you can find at the finest Chinese buffets our Northern suburbs have to offer.  (In fact, that's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars, which to me is really more like 1, since you apparently can't give NO stars.)  Everything started really going downhill after this, though.  When I'd gone to the crab area for my crab legs, I'd tried to even avoid looking at the plate of 'whole' crabs next to them... the meal hadn't been *horrible* thus far, just pretty bland (and chewy), but I was still mindful of the fact though that my general queasiness about this experience could tip over into full-blown nausea at any moment.  After a single glance at these 'whole' crabs told me something was definitely not right there, I just decided to pretend I'd never noticed them.  This plan was foiled, though, when my boyfriend, who apparently has no idea what a crab is or is not supposed to look like, brought one back to the table.  I really had no choice at that point but to look at it a bit more closely.  We ultimately concluded that there was no way this crab came from anywhere farther away than the Mon.  Had the sign above the dish indicated what species of crab this was, I might have had less difficulty with the whole thing, but to simply say that THIS thing was 'crab' made it even grosser.  It was brownish in color and had hugely disproportionate, misshapen claws that could only have resulted from exposure to some type of radiation.   The meat (which, I imagine it's needless to say by now, I didn't consume) was crumbly and dry.  I swear I could smell smoke from the mills released from its shell when he cracked it open.  I don't think I can attach a link here, but if you do a google image search of 'genetically modified spider,' or even just simply 'Love Canal,' you can probably get a better idea of what this thing looked like.  If it's not clear, I think I would go so far as to say that I was actually personally offended by this place.  I struck up a conversation with a seemingly very nice, normal-looking (remarkably so, in this place) woman in front of me at the dessert table, and she mentioned that she likes taking her son here when he comes into town for a 'nice meal.'  I wanted to cry and give her a hug.  By the way, the desserts were also extremely chewy.  And the watermelon was sour.    On our way out, we saw a sign that indicated you can have your wedding reception there.  So, in conclusion, if you are planning a wedding reception, and want that wedding reception to be the most depressing affair any of your guests have ever attended, and you want your wedding favor to be sending your loved ones home with the runs for the next three days, then I strongly recommend Hokkaido.  Since Yelp doesn't offer a rating for that, though, I'm going to go ahead and highly recommend avoiding this place.  You deserve better, and you're more likely to get it catching something 'fresh' down the hill off the Duck Hollow pier.",

For the price, $19, there is lots of variety sushi, fried foods, carving station (which was kind of sad (large link of sausage that you cut yourself and pieces of meat that were laid out that you just took), Asian soups (Tom Yum, Miso, Won Ton, Hot/Sour), and taste of food is pretty good.  They had teppan yaki stove so the cooks could make fresh hot food if you wanted.  Lots of seafood (crab, shrimp, clams), but presented in water, not steamed.   Lots of Asian dishes mostly but that's the food we're used to so no problem.  Dessert was good variety too, they hv chocolate fountain and six or so selections you could smother.  Ice Cream was suspect though.  Even tho in a freezer case, the ice cream was soft, so questionable handling.  All in all 4/5, I'd go back.",

    "text": "Listen.  I was expecting a lot more from Hokkaido.   First off, the price is absurd. $18.99 a person is a bit much for the service and food offered. They have a lot of food options, but nothing that would be suitable for a child who is picky, or an adult who doesn't like Japanese food. Their website says otherwise, which is misleading.    Secondly, everyone at my table had some type of issue with their drinks. My water tasted chemically and others mentioned their pop tasted as if the syrup mix was off, causing their drink to be way too sweet.   Third, this place is not only overpriced, but the staff/owner is severely CHEAP! There is a sign when you walk into the restaurant stating that each person is limited to 7 crab legs a person. If anyone eats more than 7 then it is an additional $1 per crab leg! The man who led us into the restaurant made us all stop and read the sign so we understood before entering. The point of an 'all you can eat' buffet is to be able to eat all you can without someone threatening to charge you more because they feel as if you had too much of something.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.   They gave my table of 4 people 4 napkins to start off with. No problem here... until we needed more napkins. When I asked for more napkins the waitress informed me that we need to completely use every napkin on our table before she will bring us more. She might as well have said, please use those dirty napkins again, because we are too cheap to bring you more.  And finally, the thing that bothers me the most with this place is that there is a small sign on every table stating that \"if you waste food then they will charge your bill an additional $8.\" The sign says it's because they like to keep their prices low, but their prices arent low!  I remembered this sign from my last visit to Hokkaido in 2016. My last visit there, the person who paid made sure that we didn't waste any food, yet he still paid the fee. This visit, since I was paying, I assured that everyone got small serving sizes to make sure they liked the food, to eliminate waste. The only scraps left on our plates were bones from chicken and the shells to some crab legs.THEY STILL CHARGED US $8!!!    This fee is completely ridiculous and is just an excuse for them to charge more money. I could have thrown all of our scraps on the ground under someone elses table and sent back completely empty plates and they probably would have still charged us an $8 fee.    The food was ok, but the way this business is ran is the reason I gave them 1 star. And because they have a dope chocolate fountain.",

Now I'm thinking like wow they really recycle food like I could've been coughing or sneezing or anything all over them and now someone else is gonna get the same ones that sat on my table for 20+ minutes.

    "text": "Visited Hokkaido for lunch to see if they'd fixed previous problems. Food and service were both better than last time.   The remaining issue a number of people complained about with them limiting the number of crab legs is pretty easy to fix. I'd suggest they use the approach that the Grand View Buffet uses. Simply lower the price of the buffet to like $15.99 and make crab legs available for an additional $6 per pound, served hot from the back, not on the buffet.",

    "text": "I was recently asked about my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. There's a solid chance this one takes the prize. Hokkaido cannot be considered buffet if it limits the amount of crab legs I can consume.   The oysters were putrid and I don't know how I mustered the courage to overcome my instincts. I wish that same visceral courage could've overcome the food poisoning that ensued.   Hokkaido is considered one of the worst buffet chains where I'm from and have always avoided it. Unfortunately, now that I'm here, sometimes I get stupid and desperate and end up at places like this.   Just keep driving, go to Costco, and make your own seafood. This place is simply not worth it.",

I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but I was disappointed in the sushi quality. They had a good variety, most of the sushi was plain and there were a few good rolls. The sashimi was good quality.   The Chinese steamed buns were delicious. There was a peach one that had a great flavor. They had the tradition orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, coconut shrimp, etc. all of this was good. They also had a Mongolian grill.   Overall this place was worth going to for the variety of food. There's something for everyone, even if you don't like seafood and or Asian food. The place was decorated nice on the inside and plenty of room. The price is $18.99 for the buffet, a little steep, but worth trying at least once. No picture because I put so much good food on my plate that it didn't look appetizing :)",

I had to ask multiple times for a drink refill and finally after the 4th time they refilled my drink. During the meal they harassed us multiple times about how many people were going on our check. I told the server how many people were on my check and she wrote it down, but still came back 4 times to ask how many people were on my check. When She brought the check I was still at the table eating she handed me the check and stood over me demanding that I pay now. They had added a 10% tip to the check, and so when I signed it without adding anything more she asked me if that was it.  I have been to this restaurant twice and both times we were treated rudely, and harassed to pay the check before we were even finished. I will never return to this place again.",

    "text": "YUMMYYYYY.  (imagine that spoken in a Cookie Monster type voice, and you can imagine the scope of the deliciousness to be found at Hokkaido).  My boyfriend and I drove past a sign that said \"Japanese Seafood Buffet\" on the way to the Waterfront, and we both immediately stopped conversing to note \"That sounds delicious....I want to go to there.\"  Coincidentally, our insurance agent mentioned Hokkaido as one of the best meals of his life, and we knew that it was our destiny.  Our delicious destiny.  We arrived at Hokkaido around 545 pm on a Saturday - super early and lame, I know, but we didn't want to have to wait for a table.  Plan worked - we were seated immediately and were in the buffet line in mere moments.  The buffet is arranged around two walls of the restaurant - it's very accessible, and easy to duck in and out to grab a quick nom of something without waiting in the whole line.  The first area is fruit/salad bar, which we mostly bypassed, except we grabbed some seaweed salad and calamari - also noted they had kimchi there as well.  Moving on, you hit some more standard Asian buffet classics, various Chinese entrees, and some more unique offerings.  I grabbed some sauteed scallops, Szechuan short rib, and then my eyes fell on the whole steamed crabs and the crab legs.  Not being in possession of the proper crab cracking tools, I went for the legs instead of the whole crab.  These are VERY popular, but they are constantly refilling the tray with fresh hot legs of nomminess, so don't worry - you'll get some.  Next is a Mongolian barbecue-esque area, where you pick your raw protein and vegetables and a dude stir fries it for you on a hot grill.  We skipped that, and the carving station next to him (couldn't see what type of meat it was).  Next is a baked/fried area filled with super-delicious looking things like egg rolls, seafood pancakes, shumai, and all kinds of awesome Japanese buns and sweets like red bean filled buns, taro buns, and sesame roll things. After that is a good-size sushi area, where sushi chefs work throughout the night to refill the platters as they empty.  There is also a small \"American section\" with boring looking pizza and corn and other lame things, and there's a dessert area too.  Most of what we had was deeeeeelicious!  Especially noteworthy are the crab legs, the red bean buns (which I became obsessed with after one bite), the shumai, and the ngiri sushi.  The rolls were all decent, some were falling apart a little bit, but the sashimi and ngiri were undoubtedly fresh.  Gorgeous cuts, fish was silky and fresh in the mouth - what more can you ask for from a SUSHI BUFFET?  I never expected sushi of this quality here - not saying it's the best I've ever had, but for $16.99 all you can eat sushi and crab legs and a million other things?  A STEAL, people.  We had a plate of hot food each, a plate of sushi each, then a pathetic attempt at dessert (small cheesecake piece, small other cake piece, another red bean bun) and then rolled ourselves home.  We had to eat everything on our plates because they will charge you $8 for uneaten food on your plate!  Not a risk we felt like taking, so load up your plates wisely!  And don't hurt anyone over those crab legs - they will bring more, I promise!",

And here's what I'd say: not going there again unless I really have to and don't have to pay for it.   Go on weekdays, unless you want to pay more than $15/person for an-OK buffet. The space is big, so it's suitable for a group dining. Parking is available for free. The food? Nothing stood out... The food wasn't horrible, but they weren't things that I couldn't find elsewhere or to die for.A lot standard Chinese food, the taste was bland. Didn't try the sushi at all because they didn't look fresh.   Was it worth the money we paid? I guess... simply coz I was pretty hungry and a buffet was a decent treat.",

There's even pizza and such for the folks who aren't the biggest fans of Asian food.  None of the food is super spectacular but considering the price and what you can get for it, this is a pretty good deal.  Just be careful to not take more than you can eat.

Appetizers-  The cheese and clam wasnt successful nor was the stuffed crab.   The salad was fresh and crispy but not a lot of variety to put on the salad.   The wonton section was fun with items such as cheese wonton, pork buns, and a variety of dumplings.  All of these were good plus there is plenty of dipping sauces which I always run out of at other chinese establishments.   I did not try the quesadillas, meat pockets, pizza or Soup.  There were 6 different types of soup ranging from wonton to Clam Chowder???  Main dish-  They had many traditional chinese items but, i particularly liked the bbq chicken.  I also went for the Mongolian BBQ.   This was cool and really was worth the price of admission.   I loaded up on the shrimp and steak which at any japanese steak house would be about $25.   The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the steak was done to my liking as well.  Again, all you can eat!    Side dishes-  Big fan of the singapore noodles  desserts: fresh fruit like kiwi and oranges, cheesecake, tapioca pudding, rice pudding and ice cream.  The place always seems crowded and for a buffet thats what i like to see because  that means high turnover of food!  I have not tried the dinner selection but am looking forward to giving that a shot once my stomach recoils back to its natural state.  For $9 its tough to beat, but would love to see some Thai food put on the buffet somewhere, just some simple curries would be sweet!",

    "text": "Somewhere around a 2.5 overall experience. This is a pricey buffet costing about $20 per person, not including tip, but is still significantly better than many of the 0-1 star $7-$10 buffets I've tried throughout Pittsburgh.   I went to Hokkaido on Saturday afternoon with five other friends. We were seated quickly and given water after our drink orders were taken. The food here is subpar at best and the tiny bit of service expected at a buffet (such as refilling drinks) is almost nonexistent. We had to flag down several different employees in order to have our drinks refilled throughout the course of dinner. The only thing that I truly enjoyed was the hibachi-style service bar at the back of the buffet where you could pick the ingredients that you wanted the attendant to prepare, it tasted yummy and the white sauce was very good. The buffet was set up like a high school cafeteria and nothing looked too appetizing. The sushi tasted like supermarket sushi and the frog legs were okay. Avoid the shark (because it's old) and stock up on edible seafood, like the crab legs, if you want to try and get your money's worth of food (which I was unable to do).   The dessert bar was bland. The flan and \"puddings\" (one was just mashed Oreos covered in whipped cream and the other was dried out bananas covered in a very thin layer of vanilla pudding and wafers) were gross and mushy. Even the chocolate fountain that I was looking forward to wasn't very good. I ended up sticking to the plain marshmallows which were in the section labeled \"For Chocolate Fountain Dipping Only.\" I did like their selection of sorbets and ice creams.  Once 3 members in our group had stop eating a server promptly put down our check, hand wipes, and fortune cookies without bothering to ask if we were finished eating. We paid the bill, but continued eating for another 30 minutes until we noticed that the staff seemed to be impatiently watching us as if asking us to leave (and it wasn't because they were closing either). We quickly finished our small desserts, read our fortunes, and left. I understand wanting to maximize table turnover rates, but a business should never make its customers feel uneasy and rushed.  The relatively high price, mediocre food, and below average service made me feel very MEH about this buffet. I am in no rush to go back and wouldn't recommend it to any friends. I guess I'll just have to accept the fact that Pittsburgh just doesn't have any good buffets...",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I'm typically a pretty harsh reviewer when it comes to buffets since to me buffet quality food is synonymous to takeout quality, and why would someone dine out to just have takeout?  Also, for the same cost and time spent at a buffet one can go to a much better restaurant with better tasting and quality food.  With that in mind, I have to say Hokkaido isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  So here's what I have to recommend:  1.  Go for lunch.  Only go for lunch.  At $8.99, it's probably one of the cheapest if not the cheapest buffet out there.  If you're shelling out over $20 for dinner including drinks, why not just go to a Chinese restaurant w/ a nicer ambiance and better quality food like China Palace?  2.  Go early.  I've been there once around 12:30 and once around 2:30 PM and there's a giant difference in the quality of the food.  Get there either before or during the lunch rush.  They have adequate seating and it's not like you'll be waiting... it IS a buffet.  Food will be coming out a lot faster and everything will be fresher.  3.  Stick w/ salmon nigiri.  If you're here for the sushi, their rolls just don't cut it, and their salmon nigiri is probably the only thing worth eating.  Their other options aren't really passable.  4.  Get their dim sum.  If you're going when they're busy, fresh handmade dim sum is being made all the time.  And where in Pittsburgh can you get non-frozen sui mei?  I also like their pork buns (only if they're freshly made of course).  5.  Avoid the usual suspects.  You know what fried rice tastes like.  You know what lo mein tastes like.  You know what chicken teriyaki and General Tso's tastes like.  You know it's all loaded with excessive MSG and you'll have cotton mouth while feeling like crap later.  6.  Do try their Mongolian BBQ / Teppanyaki.  The chef actually knows what he's doing and cooks kinda okay.  If you're new to Mongolian BBQ, it might be daunting, but after a while you should be able to figure out what sauce combinations taste good.  The chef can make a sauce for you, but I don't like my dishes as salty as your average patron.  I find myself eating their salmon nigiri, their dim sum, their beef brisket soup, and their \"szechuan-style\" pork.  I also get some veggies, be it baby bok choi, green beans, or broccoli for the sole reason of pretending to be healthy.  I stay clear of all their other sushi, their, pizza, sausage, pork loin, and random Americanized Chinese.  A quick nigiri fix with some handmade dim sum in Pittsburgh for 11 bucks seems pretty good for me.",

    "text": "This place is great to get stuffed with a lot of different types of Asian food. The quality is decent, but definitely not top notch. However, given the price ($17 per person, and that includes your non-alcoholic drinks and dessert), I think it is very reasonable. Staff are attentive and courteous. There is also a section of food for those not liking Asian food - fried chicken, pizza, etc, a hibachi type area where you choose your meats and veggies to be stir fried, and sushi. The sushi/sashimi is decent - and some I can tell were frozen, but still good. Hey, it is a buffet after all, and it will be tons cheaper if you fill up on sushi here. There are also typical chinese dishes like lo mein and such, and a few more exotic things like kim-chi and chicken feet. Overall, a fun and clean buffet, in a very nice atmosphere.",

I actually liked this Hokkaido more than the one I visited in VA.  Why, you ask?  It's very simple.  As a lover of seafood etc, this Hokkaido had more to offer.  The things I loved, free crab legs (which wasn't included in the dinner buffet price in VA), oysters, MANGO SALAD!!!!!!! yes yes yes nom nom nom, dim sum, fried shrimp, small clams in black bean sauce, and sashimi (which I also appreciate so I don't have to throw away the useless filling rice).  I mean who wouldn't want to fill up on these amazing things.  The only complaint I have about this is that they didn't refill oysters as fast as my table was eating them, probably because we were devouring them ^_^  Also, I know that they have a sign/pamphlet on the table \"Don't waste food, you will be charged,\" which I'm actually kind of curious if they really keep to this, as our table was scared shitless we ate every last bite :)  I would definitely recommend this place for a hungry party of seafood and Chinese food lovers,  GOO!! you won't regret it.",

There's also a habachi grill in the buffet line, with a cook who prepares to order. I even got to try frog legs for the first time! There's so much good food there!  The seafood stuffed mushrooms were the absolute best!   The service was great too. The wait staff kept our table clear of plates, and messes, and our glasses were refilled before they were empty. I'll definitely be back here, it was absolutely delicious, with excellent service.",

Sushi is fresh and tasty. Basically something for everyone. Crab legs for dinner bumps the price a few bucks - too salty for my taste and I don't bother. Don't waste food!

My lunch tab was roughly half of dinner or around $10-11 depending on beverage and tip.  Selections were similar to dinner except no Peking Duck, crab legs, grilled eel sushi, and only Red Snapper in sashimi form (tuna and salmon available in Sushi form).   The cold section amusingly labels crawfish as mini-lobsters and also had duck wings and pig ear. Still love their hot and sour soup and wish I found gravy for the mashed potatoes.  Service is good and parking plentiful. Certain to become a regular lunch spot for me while I am in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "When this place first opened, I was a huge fan of their menu and was very excited about the large amount of sushi options they offered. A pan-asian buffet was all I could ever dream of! I had been to both lunch and dinner here and never had to wait for a table and always had very attentive service, even if it is a bit loud and crowded at certain times.  That was all until sometime in January when I went with a friend. We were both excited because we liked the food so much from previous visits. We went during peak dining hours (8pm on a Saturday night) and the place was packed. We didnt mind and went about our usual routine. We both noticed that the food wasn't up to the usual standards but barreled through it, wary of the infamous fee one is charged ($8) for wasting food.   When we got to the sushi, it was WAY off. Typically they have very fresh fish, but that night it had a bad aftertaste and texture as if it had been sitting out all day. Fish, ESPECIALLY raw fish, is one thing I refuse to compromise quality on. I didn't finish my plate and neither did my friend. Our server came and cleared away plates but deliberately left the sushi one on the table, though it was clear we were finished with it. Our server asked what was wrong and we told her the sushi tasted bad like something was wrong with it and almost immediately the whole feel of the dinner changed. We went back for seconds, our server cleared our plates and still left the sushi.   Our check was delivered to our table by the manager who was extremely accusatory about us wasting food. No lie, her exact words were \"This is all you can eat, not all you can leave on your plate.\" After a baffled exchange at the piss poor way we were treated and pretty much berated by the manager for refusing to eat their gross sushi in front of the entire dining room, we hurriedly paid the check and left.   If you've ever been to this place, you know how ginormous the restaurant is and believe me when I say that just about every table was filled to the brim with paying customers. Why this woman was on a mission to collect a measly $8 for something that wasn't exactly our fault is beyond me. I understand their concerns about food waste, but quite honestly that is the risk you run when you open a buffet. It's not like we had 5 plates full of sushi left or anything. Needless to say, I won't be back. Shame because I used to really enjoy coming here.",

The restaurant was busy, a bit noisy, with aromas of grilled meat wafting through the air.  The sushi selection was limited but of decent quality (don't ask me about the raw fish). There are about 8 different rolls to choose from. In addition, seafood and crab are popular (not so tasty). There are some items for those with adventurous palates--whole baby octopus, squid, raw shellfish. The desert buffet was disappointing with few and low quality items in its offering. There are lots of cheap carbs too--rice, noodles. 4 different types of soup are also part of the buffet. On Saturday evenings, the buffet is $19.25 including tax.  This was a good experience that everyone in Pittsburgh should try once, although I am not sure I will be back anytime soon.",

But most people that come here aren't going for those items, the golden ticket here are differently the crab legs. The legs here are very good for being a buffet, there's plenty of meat in the legs and the meat looks fresh as you pull it out of its shell. If one is a fan of crab legs, one can easily consume a dozen of these. There's also oysters here, they do vary in size but generally fresh. The oysters aren't the best when it comes to flavor. They also have a good range of sushi, such as salmon and tuna sashimi, and common rolls likes california roll, crazy roll, veggie, etc. There's an OK selection of desserts, but they do have a chocolate fountain for dipping in fruits and marshmallows if you're into that...  I've been here a few times and service is generally good. However on our last visit, the wait staff was a bit impatient. The waitress taking our drink orders literally rolled her eyes when we asked for water with lemon. It sure was a busy day, but don't bring it upon your customers!",

    "text": "Some of the items at Hokkaido were decent, but I wasn't satisfied with most of the food. I don't know about Pittsburgh, but there are better Chinese buffets elsewhere.  First of all, the designation of \"Seafood Buffet\" is a bit misleading. Sure, they have an extensive sushi/sashimi section, but other than that everything else is the same as other buffets. Also, while acceptable, the quality of the sushi isn't good. Everything has that watery, pre-frozen taste. The sushi's texture and smell is fine though, and everything gets replaced pretty frequently.  The hot section of the buffet is a mixed bag. The highlights of the meal were the crab legs, baby clams, and salt and peppper crab. The crab legs were meaty, and buttery sweet. The baby clams were tender and served in a savory black bean sauce. The salt and pepper crab was salty, crispy, and sweet. The hibachi station and some of the fried appetizers are satisfying.  However, every other dish at Hokkaido is below average or average. Nothing is offensive (besides the large clams, I ate one and spit it out), but nothing else is of a decent quality. Yes, this is a buffet, but having 5 dishes worth eating out of the 50+ available isn't what I consider buffet success. I ate my weight in crab and clams, but I go to buffets for variety. I probably won't be returning for a while with that in mind.",

Everyone's reviews were right on.     There is a lot of high quality Sushi.  The Hibachi grill had a good selection of vegetables and meat.  This is the first one I have ever seen with Shark.  I was pleasantly surprised to find crab legs that weren't waterlogged (like many other buffets).  There were numerous shrimp dishes, crabs, oysters, frog legs, mussels, clams, calamari.  For non seafood people there was a decent number of chicken dishes. I don't recall seeing any beef or pork dishes.  They had several soups; I tried the clam chowder which was very disappointing.    There was a carving station for beef - didn't see anyone going there.  Plenty of Asian  appetizers and a few American dishes (pizza) - which I didn't pay much attention to.    The deserts consisted of a chocolate fountain with marshmallows, poor quality pineapple, stale rice crispy bars, bananas, and something I couldn't identify.  They did have fruit (melon, kiwi), jello, ice cream, rice pudding and the usual boxed cakes/cookies you see at Chinese Buffets.   Servers were friendly and refilled drinks quickly.   $18 is a little pricey for a buffet but I wasn't upset paying it. Beware they charge $8 if you waste too much food.  I wonder if they have ever charged anyone that.",

I was even tempted to give Hokkaido 5 stars, because it was just a really nice dining experience with our friends and their kids.  There is easy parking.  It's loud and kid-friendly.  I'm not even sure if the table next to us noticed our wailing baby.  And the service was pretty attentive, even though it was buffet style.  The staff was excellent about taking our plates and asking for refills, and friendly to boot.  Oh yeah, and it's BYOB - there is a beer place up the road, but it only sells it by the case.  The food itself isn't amazing.  There is a very good variety, likely to appease your Asian cravings.  There are some quite authentic Chinese dishes, too, you typically find at Dim Sum.  There are chicken legs, sticky rice with red bean, seaweed salad,steamed pork buns, and others.  You always have to assume the presence of other Asians in the restaurant has to confer some legitimacy to the food.  In reality, though, the food was mostly okay.  Like I said in the beginning, though, as you get older, your priorities change.   Also, for two adults to eat for less than $40 total is pretty cost-effective.  They didn't charge our toddlers, unlike some other places (*ahem* Grand Concourse *ahem* for nearly $20 *ahem* to eat fries and cookies).  I can see this place being a go-to get together spot with other friends with kids  Would I have preferred to eaten at Eleven or Meat & Potatoes, or NOLA?  YES!  Is that realistic with a party of four adults, two 2-year olds, and two 3-4 month olds?  NO!  And so as parents, we have to place convenience, expedience, and a if-my-kid-throws-a-tantrum-will-anyone-care atmosphere, above the tastiness of food.  Sometimes.",

I didn't like everything but I thought majority of it was very good. The place was very clean and food actually LOOKED good so that is a big difference from a lot of buffets that I have been to.   I was able try a lot new dishes that I definitely wouldn't have ordered in a regular restaurant. I tried some of my husband's SHARK (very odd, I know) and it didn't taste bad but the fact that I knew it was shark, made it not appealing to me. The fried frog legs were great! The taro cake was surprisingly good.   The sushi didn't taste cheap at all and it was made very well. It wasn't the best sushi I ever tasted but it was the best buffet sushi I ever had! lol ALL of the Chinese food dishes were excellent and I don't even like chinese food that much!!   I thought it was cute that they gave us warm towels with our bill... that was a nice touch.   The only bad thing was the table service! It was very hard to get a refill and get our check. The waiter gave our card to the WRONG table so it was a good thing that no one was sitting at the table.   Overall, I would definitely go again and recommend everyone should go at least once. Oh and if you don't have a very diverse palate, there are food choices for you like pizza, egg rolls, soup,and things of that nature.",

This place is one of the awesome.  I find the service is good and it has a wide selection of food with good quality and price is reasonable. It's clean and the food has always been fresh when I have gone. It also has a full hibachi station and sushi line. I have never had the hibachi but the sushi selection is great for the price. The only downside is the dessert area. The chocolate fountain is meh and apart from the ice cream it's just below average. But I'm a savory kinda guy and it's not a big deal to me.  I like Chinese buffets when I get a sudden craving for greasy Chinese food and a lot of it. It's a time when I can dawn my finest pair of stretchy pants and eat until they rip and still be the thinnest person in the room.",

    "text": "Oh boy...this place. I feel like every time I eat here I have to train for it. I always go with the same crew and we always plan to come here at least a day in advance in order to keep our bellies at bay until we dive into the buffet. So far, every time I've come here, there's been no wait and the buffet lines were short, if there was any at all. Seafood was the freshest I've ever had in the Pittsburgh area and trust me, I took advantage of every piece of seafood they have. Hokkaido houses an impressive amount of food ranging from New York steak to fresh crab legs and oysters. I would avoid the steak though, it looks a bit tough and shriveled as does the Peking duck. I do however, recommend their crab legs and octopus covered in a tasty sriracha sauce in addition to their coffee ice cream.   As for ambience, it's well lit and clean. Music choices can be a bit confusing, but I always find that to be an excellent conversational point. One thing that does irk me about this place is the waitstaff. They constantly hover around the tables, snatching plates and glasses away from you. Especially when it comes to receiving the check, I always feel like I'm being rushed out of the place...but don't think I'll rush out, it's all you can eat and I intend to eat all that I can!   Bottom line: For $17.99, you can eat anything and everything here. I highly recommend this buffet, it's worth every penny!",

Went in during lunch and had a small plate with a few pieces of coconut shrimp which was ok, a few \"salt & pepper shrimp\" and the regular little crab. The salt & pepper shrimp was dry the seasoning was alright but the shrimp was dry like a rubber band. The crab was dry as well, so dry that it stuck to the shell and you could get it off.  Spoke to the manager whom said \"you didn't eat much\" clearly he was watching me. I told him no as the food was not good. He told me I should go back and find something as he would not refund me my small plate, it's not like I ate half the buffet and didn't like it. He even suggested that I ate my $10 worth of fruit, he was just simply rude and I would not go back nor would I recommend it to anyone else.",

They have instituted a new policy where each person can only have 7 legs and after that, they will charge you per pound.  While I'm not sure how they would enforce this policy, we were respectful of it.  We didn't find the other food on the buffet to be anything better than average.  My husband did say the sushi was good.  We probably won't be going back (and apparently other people feel the same way -- it was as empty on a Saturday night as I've ever seen it).",

    "text": "Great place to go if you have a big appetite and want to try a lot of different good sea food, sushi, and asian food.  There's so much to try!   My three main highlights are 1. Crab legs, 2. Sushi, and 3. Chocolate fountain.    Dinner is $18 and Lunch is $10.  Visit during typical lunch and dinner hours (so you know the food has just been put out).  It's usually busy during these hours, though the restaurant is quite large so you can usually still be seated.    ASIAN DELICACIES Lots of food you'd find at a typical asian buffet such as fried rice, chinese seafood.   The have some sepcial food such as frog legs, squid, scallops, mussels, and raw oyster.   The CRAB LEGS, probably the most expensive item there, were immensely popular and had a line of several people the entire night.  I think some people just go here for the crab legs.  SUSHI: This is one of the highlights, as the sushi is quite good.  It's hand-rolled and there were two dedicated cooks there rolling sushi the entire time.   There's lots of variety including california rolls, philadelphia rolls, rainbow rolls, and different sashimi.    SALAD and FRUIT BAR: Most of what you'd expect at a typical salad and fruit bar.  SOUP: Wide variety of soup to choose from including sweet and sour, wonton, clam chowder, etc...  MONGOLIAN BBQ STATION: I have to say this is a nice touch.  You have several things to pick from such as vegetables, pineapple, noodles, SHARK, and sauces, and the some guy will throw it on a teppanyaki grill for you.    DESSERT area: They have a gigantic CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN, which you can dip marshmallows. rice crispy treats, peanut brittle, banana into.  This is definitely the highlight of the dessert area.  They also have ice cream, fruit, pudding, and some other pies here.",

There's a decent variety of the traditional Chinese-restaurant fare, which isn't anything ridiculously impressive but probably above-average by buffet standards.  They do have a grilling station where you can choose various meats and other ingredients, and have it cooked for you. I didn't partake, so can't comment on the quality of this offering. They offered a pretty decent variety of what I'd consider decent sushi by buffet standards that seems to rotate pretty frequently, and includes things from super tame (California rolls) to the fishier offerings (tuna, eel, etc). There's also a selection of things that could appeal to kids that got dragged along and don't enjoy Asian food, such as pizza, chicken wings, and other traditional fare.  It'd be unfair to leave out their dessert section, which includes all kinds of fruit with a chocolate fountain, ice cream, various puddings, fruit salads... the offerings do seem to change between visits, which keeps things new.  Lunch is a bit cheaper (it's what we've usually gone for), but dinner includes crab legs on the buffet for your extra money. Overall, this is a pretty solid buffet that I'd recommend and will certainly return to in the future, but wouldn't go too far out of my way for.",

They're relatively busy during prime rush hours, so food is pretty fresh all the time (except for the non-Chinese stuff like chicken tenders, pizza, cheese stuffed whatevers but I don't go here for that). Lots of dishes, both classic Chinese-American favorites and more inventive ones (sprite steak!) that get changed up every time I go (rareish occasionally), mongolian bbq made to order station, fruit/ice cream desserts, and the newly added chocolate fountain (though I'm not sure how well-monitored the sanitation is for that...). And I particularly like that they have like 6 soups, so not just your generic hot and soup and egg drop.   Seafood buffet's in their name - pretty good cooked seafood. Crab legs are there. Some sort of clam dish. Raw bar with oysters and mussels, some seaweed salads. Seafood featuring soups. All pretty good. But their sushi is terrible. Their fish is really grainy, horrible texture and flavor. I mean, nothing sketch smelling or anything, but just bad quality fish. The rolls are okay mainly because the fish isn't as prominent. I know it's a buffet and not an expensive sushi place, but for the up charge in price versus a normal Chinese buffet, I would expect at least decent fish.   Service is pretty good here in terms of plates not piling up at the table, water being filled. Even with the bad sushi, this is my family's go-to buffet, but they're not big on sushi and I have enough of that where I live.",

Nothing tasted overly \"fishy\", the dining room smelled clean, and they don't fry everything or cover it in cloying sauce. For the negatives, the dessert section was pretty paltry and I didn't like the sushi very much.  Price is kind of expensive for dinner and weekend meals (I assume because the crab leg trough is dinner only) but lunch ($10)  is about right for what sort of things they serve.

    "text": "Being that I lived in SC for years I wasn't expecting much from Hokkaido. Some of the seafood dishes were the normal overly cooked american versions of Chinese that you can get anywhere, but they did have some interesting and tasty food.   My BF liked some of the cooked beef. I liked the crab, and the sushi wasn't as bad as it could have been. The seaweed salad was better than expected. I LOVED the chocolate fountain! (who doesn't?)    I was overall pleased with the food, but I expected a different atmosphere (I don't know what I was thinking). There were screaming kids in seats and running around EVERYWHERE! Bleh. I know they charge an extra fee for wasting food... they should charge one for bad ass kids too...",
