    "text": "A good friend recommended this place, so my husband and I decided to try it this past weekend.  When I made the reservation, I was asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, so I said yes- we would be celebrating my husband's birthday.  I thought this was a nice touch and assumed they would do something special for him (a complimentary dessert, glass of champagne, etc.) as we have experienced this at other restaurants.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, we checked in with the hostess who said \"Happy Birthday\" and took us to our table.  We were seated in a small room with about 3 other couples and 3-4 tables of very large, very loud parties.  We could barely hear each other which was extremely annoying.. Our waiter came to  greet us and asked how we were doing.  We asked how he was doing as well, which turned out to be a mistake, as every time he came back to our table he began complaining about how much he loathes Valentine's Day and can't wait to be done with his shift.  When ordering our meals, he asked us both if we wanted soup or salad with our dinner- as if a choice of one came with the meal... we later found out they did not.  I feel that he should have mentioned this to us.  Also, I ordered a filet cooked medium that was unfortunately well done (and rather tough) when it got to our table.  My husband's rack of lamb was mediocre at best.  Other couples around us were complaining about how loud and UN-romantic the setting was considering most were out to celebrate Valentine's Day. All in all, considering the noise level, grumpy waiter, just average food, no extra touches for a special occasion and a $175... totally not worth it.",

    "text": "Terrible for large parties!   We gathered all together to celebrate one of my best friends birthdays and from start to finish the night turned into a debacle. We initially had 2 waiters that took the drink order and the leading gentlemen made a presentation regarding the different beef's the restaurant had to offer. Shortly after that, the female server went around the table and took the dinner/appetizer orders and it went all down hill from there. She began on the right side of the table then stopped mid way through, for an unknown reason, and resumed on the opposite side. Which at first it didn't seem like an issue until 2hrs later she comes back to the table and advises that the kitchen got the dinner order \"wet\" and the ink bled all over the slip and no one's order was placed so she had to go back around and take the dinner order again.     After the food started to arrive about 30 to 45 minutes after that, multiple orders had missing items. For example a guest ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and the mac n cheese but their mac and cheese was missing, also there was 2 salads that were given to the wrong guest. In addition I ordered a barry white that sat empty for one hour before anyone on the wait staff offered my another. At this hour the entire party is exhausted and almost immediately everyone ask for boxes to take their food home. The male waiter proceded to take each plate and return each bag to members of the party by throwing it on the floor and under the table cloth, the female waiter returns and placed each bag on top of the table. Which caused some confusion as to what happened that the male waiter would think that some of the guests food deserved to be thrown under the table and disregarded. After that a guest presents a cake to the birthday guest and the male waiter asks if he would like it cut and plated, the birthday guest responds by saying yes and can you only cut 7 slices. The waiter returns with approximately 6 more servers who cut the entire cake and served it to the entire party which was 12. The night ends everyone settles their balances and leaves. Not one person apologized for \"loosing/forgetting\" the dinner order, the amount of time we were there or the level of service we received.      I can not express how truly upset I feel knowing the Eddie Merlot standard from previous visits to the experience on Friday night and on top of it all it was my best friends birthday. There needs to be a apology of some sort issued either to the party or to the birthday guest for the night we had. If this is any example of how larger parties are treated I will no longer suggest going to Eddie Merlot's to celebrate.",

    "text": "My experience here is from a work reception, so I can't fully review the restaurant.  However, I can at least warn anyone else looking to have a reception here.    The reserved private \"Board Room\", which seemed more like a glass closet, was not ready for us when we arrived at our reservation time.  It still took a good 30 minutes to an hour after letting us into the room for them to finish setting up and bring the hors d'oeuvres out.  Several of my coworkers had to change their drink orders repeatedly because the restaurant didn't have the tools or ingredients to make it, or didn't have the alcohol.  Most of the hors d'oeuvres were not gluten-free, but luckily I had requested beforehand that at least one gluten-free option be provided.  This ended up being shrimp cocktail and a fruit and cheese plate, so not too bad, although my stomach wasn't feeling too hot afterwards.  There were also skewers of meat, grilled onions, and peppers.  I tried one, and the meat was so bad I couldn't even cut it with the steak knives we had to request specifically for that purpose.  I understand wanting to use up the less than stellar stuff in things like skewers, but that was just bad.  My coworker's piece was hardly cooked at all, and he couldn't eat it.  Not too promising for what is supposed to be a steak place.  I can't say I'll ever come here again.",

I Our first impression was not great as the valets ignored us while they watched a fight that had broken out across the street at in front of McDonald's. Our waiter was too familiar in how he addressed us and he did not fix things that were clearly subpar---e.g., my Manhattan cocktail that was brought to me half full, sans cherries, even though I had asked for extra cherries. We all made comments about it and he ignored us and, throughout the meal, we had to flag down another server to have an issue addressed, such as extra salad dressing. Many steaks had to be sent back for being improperly cooked and my ribeye, the only steak I ever order, was ok and not well marbled. The sides were good.  For the price of this meal I expected much better quality food and much more attentive and professional service. This was NOT value for money. 2.3 stars is the accurate rating so I rounded down.",

    "text": "Stopped in after work for appetizers and drinks for happy hour, the cocktails were fairly strong, which I appreciate, and a good price during happy hour--although during regular hours it looks like they're the most expensive cocktails of all of the fine dining restaurants downtown. I expect pricy drinks downtown, but not New York City pricy. Anyway, when it came time to order my friend flagged down the bartender, I couldn't quite hear what the bartender was saying (his lips were moving, I thought that maybe he was introducing himself or giving any additional specials) so I leaned toward him and said \"I'm sorry, what?\" He replied by flailing his hands and yelling \"you have to go, go, go!\" Listen, I served in several fine dining and some not so fine-very high volume restaurants and no matter how busy we were, I would never have said that to a customer. Not ever. It wasn't even much of a rush, in the entire restaurant if he can't handle the little burst of people that came in then he should be thankful that he never worked at Harris Grill during bacon night, my god.   Anyway, I ordered a large plate of beef carpaccio to share with everyone and it was...interesting, I mean it was good, don't get me wrong but it was definitely different. It had your typical thinly sliced raw beef (although thicker than most places) with capers, balsamic, and olive oil, but there was a truffle aioli on it that seemed more like store (well, sysco) bought mayo with truffle oil whisked in---which, yeah, is poor man's aioli, but not what you'd expect from a place trying to pass as fine dining. It was served with house fried potato chips, which I assumed was meant for you to but the beef on and eat in one bite, it was different, but it tasted good, then again after two cocktails pretty much anything tastes good, I just didn't get that wonderful classic, fresh flavor from it like I'm accustomed to with carpaccio.   Super long review short, the food was pretentious in it's quest to be inventive, it was pretty overpriced for what it was and the bartender was a douche, plain and simple. I will admit that I overtipped and I always do because I know that servers pretty much assume you're an asshole and don't consider that maybe they just sucked when you don't put at least 20%. I won't go back, I'll probably try and talk my coworkers into going somewhere else for our next happy hour, give it another year or two and Eddie Merlot's will go the direction of Palomino which stood in that spot before it.",

I booked a reservation thru Open Table, and was greeted (and seated), immediately upon arrival.  My server, Rihanna, was awesome, very attentive without hovering.   I received a loaf of the herb bread, with butter and proceeded to order the Short Rib meatloaf, garlic mashed potatoes, accompanied by a wedge salad.  The salad arrived a short time later, nice portion, freshly prepared and topped with bleu cheese dressing.  The entree arrived shortly after finishing the salad.  The meatloaf was super tender, and seasoned nicely.  I could actually see lots of shredded short rib, throughout the beef mixture.  The portion was more than adequate, couldn't quite finish it all (I tried!).  The mashed potatoes, were rich and tasty, as well.  I did opt for dessert (to-go).  I was not as impressed with dessert, as I was with dinner.  The portion was HUGE, enough for 3-4 people to share.  The cake was just ok, reminded me more of spice/fruit cake than carrot carrot.  Texture was very firm.  I received 2 large, 4 layer slices and ate approx 1/2 of 1 slice.  Overall the food and service was stellar!  I will ABSOLUTELY return to Eddie Merlot's.",

She was able to perfectly suggest apps that were not too much or too little for the table. The presentation of the apps were eye appealing and they all tasted delicious.  We ordered the sesame calamari, ahi tuna wontons and crab cakes, all were cooked to perfection an beautifully presented.  Dinner for me was sesame ahi tuna, slightly seared but left perfectly rare served with seaweed salad.  Yummmmmm!  Others tried the braised short ribs, various cuts of steaks, salmon and the roasted bell and evens chicken.  There was not one complaint at the table, everything was cooked perfectly.  Then came dessert......WOW.  We had 2 tableside presentations, bannanas foster and vanilla congnac brownie with a creme brule also.  Do yourself a favor and order one of the tableside presentations, delicious and worth it for the presentation by the waitstaff!  This is one amazing restaurant, decor, wine choices (which were simply jawdropping), ambiance, service, food and value. I said value because I think that for apps, meal and dessert with this type of perfection that was about $100  per person (without drinks) is reasonable. This is not something i could afford often but would certainly want to visit several times a year if I lived local which sadly i do not.  Please come to CT, MA or RI, we would welcome you with open arms.  Thank you for a really memorable meal and remember, ask for Tera!  Kerry",

It's a spacious dining establishment with a lot of contemporary/classical decor. The warm wooden furniture and rich, vibrant colors were great, especially juxtaposed to the lovely green view outside the glass windows. Service was great - maitre d explained everything to us and gave us great recommendations on the wine.  I had a glass of Decoy - Cabernet Sauvignon that has the exactly the level of fruitiness that I want. Nice, smooth and refreshing. I also loved that they had an iPad app for their wine list - made things so much easier to look up (you can search by age, type, price, etc.).  For the appetizer, I got the house salad, which was presented in this lovely angled bowl. Salad itself was alright, croutons were fantastic and fresh. Not your typical, gross, stale, Olive Garden croutons.  Bread was amazing too - a bit logistically hard to eat without making a mess haha, but so warm and fluffy. Seasoned very well too, and the butter that came along with it was delectable.  Main dish for me was the Steak Diane. They asked me how I wanted the steak to be prepared and I said medium rare, like always. However, it was basically well done when I got it. Also, it wasn't so much what I consider a steak rather than a stew. It really just reminded me of a beef stew sprinkled over mashed potatoes. Bland. Heavy. Disappointing.   Dessert redeemed itself - I had a slice of the carrot cake and it was probably the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. Moist, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I was so impressed. The frosting was a bit heavy for me, but then again, most frostings are heavy for me. Very pleased with the carrot cake.  Beautiful venue, lovely staff, great wine, decent food. I think I just ordered the wrong dish - my friend got the cedar plank salmon and was very pleased. Might come back again!",

    "text": "I would love to go four and 3/4 stars but I have to go with what I am given. The only little criticism I have is that the steak was a little salty but don't get me wrong it was still phenomenal! We got there a little early and were told they were not ready to seat us yet but we could enjoy the bar. We did so. Tiffany was our bartender and she was friendly and knowledgeable. The hubby got a gin and tonic and as gin and tonics go this one was mixed just right. I chose the white sangria which was light and refreshing and looked so summery and pretty. We were summoned by the host, Watson (I believe this was his name and if it was not I am sorry). He was friendly and prompt. We were taken to our table which had a nice view of the patio area. We were greeted promptly by John, our waiter. He was attentive and knowledgeable all evening. He was spot on but not in our faces even working to get me a few scallops as my \"surf\". Perfect! We got bread immediately which was fresh and warm. We got apps. I got the fried calamari which was fresh and the breading was light and not overly greasy. It came with a trio of dipping sauces which were wasabi, soy, and mustard all were good. I liked mustard the best. The hubby got the lobster bisque which was creamy and rich with flavor. For our main course I got a ribeye, medium rare as did the hubby. They were cooked perfectly. They are amazing even though a smidge salty...still amazing and juicy. Yum! I got surf and turf so I got two scallops with my steak. The scallops are not listed as a surf item but I asked and they worked it out for me. (Thank you John and Mr. Chef). The scallops were so fresh, cooked to perfection, and the texture buttery. Wow! We got three sides which are huge and most certainly shareable. We got the sweet potato casserole which could be dessert as well, my favorite! We got mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts as well they were good too. The hubby got after dinner coffee which was really good as far as coffee goes and I got the peanut butter cup which was rich and light (if that makes any sense). From start to finish, it was phenomenal! It is a little pricey but we expected that.  It helped that we had a gift card that we got for Christmas a few years ago and a coupon. Can't beat that! We thoroughly enjoyed our 15th anniversary dinner.",

They are from China  and this was their first time in Pittsburg and I thought it would be a good idea to treat them a nice steak.  Therefore picked this place as the reviews on Yelp were pretty decent.  Indeed, the steaks here were excellent.  I had a ribeye and it was delicious, tender, juicy and very tasty.  My friends had bone-in fillets and they loved the steaks.  Don't mean to brag, I have been many 5-star steak houses, but this one is definitely on par with the others.  The service was excellent. We were there on last Sunday and many wines were half price!!!!  We killed 3 bottles.  And the desserts were awesome.  Anyway I high recommend this place and would come back again next time visiting Pittsburg!",

    "text": "It's okay, but I was disappointed.  The service was excellent - attentive, but not stuffy or too high-brow.  Our server read us well, and opened up a bit, and was very helpful in the process.  The environment is open and loud.  There were many large tables, and these bigger groups were loud.  Fine, but not what I expected.  It was hard to chat with my lovely wife at times.  The food was good, but lacked a real edge to get me excited.  Here are some notes:  - My New York Strip was cooked as I requested, but was on the thin side, had a  big strip of untrimmed fat (which a NY Strip should not have), and lacked surface texture.  I do not think they seasoned this cut much, if any.  - Their featured jalapeno potato side-dish was blah.  No bite at all from the peppers, and just potatoes, which are bland without spices.  There is some cheese in there, but Hyde Park's Gruyere Potatoes would crush this dish, as would Capital Grill's au gratin potato dish.  - The Creamed Spinach was excellent - not soupy, like some do, and not overcooked to a mush.  Very good here.  - My wife's Ribeye was also good, not great, again, seeming to lack much surface texture and seasoning.  - The Key Lime Pie is very good, properly tart, and not artificially colored (thank you).  - Their coffee is excellent, served in a French press.  So overall, I was let down.  In this area, I enjoy Hyde Park Grille much better, and would put Capital Grille ahead as well.  If you have been to a Flemings or Ruth's Chris, I prefer them Eddie Merlot's as well.",

Unlike other places where you practically have to book weeks in advance!  I'm not sure if the brunch buffet is regularly occurring or if it's only for special occasions like Mother's Day. Anyway, the food was delicious and very good quality! They have a breakfast section, lunch, salad, seafood, carving station, omelette station, dessert with bananas fosters station!   What I loved about this place is that it's quiet and more intimate than other brunch buffets. Don't get me wrong, EM was busy, just not crazy!! You're not bumping elbows with people.  Overall I really love this place. Seats are the most comfiest restaurant seats I've ever sat in!! I'll be back.  By the way, my parents were very impressed with EM. Thanks for a great experience.",

I've had a variety of apps, including their shrimp, oysters, beef carpaccio, and beef tartare. There are not many places I would trust to serve raw options, but I was very impressed! I am a stickler for the prep of my meat. If I order a steak medium rare, I want to see that red meat! The steaks are always cooked exactly as ordered.  The last time I went was my first experience of lunch and I was pleased. Kay was our server and I honestly can't remember the last time I had a server as great as her! She was polite, funny and extremely attentive to our table of 2 despite having to serve a huge table next to us as well! Quality of service can really make or break a meal for me and Kay was so wonderful!  If the dinner menu is too financially intimidating for you, their prices are very reasonable for lunch. I believe my burger was around $16 and was served with parmesan truffle fries. That price is not much more than you'd be charged somewhere more casual with typical bar fare and believe me... it's worth the few extra bucks!",

    "text": "Probably the best steak I have had in PGH. (simple Medium .07oz Filet Mignon - no sauce).  I ate here on a Wednesday evening around 7PM. We made reservations but there were several empty tables.   Our Menu: -Filet Mignon -New Orleans Mixed Grill* (4 oz. filet mignon, grilled shrimp, Andouille sausage, roasted garlic mashed potatoes) -Asparagus -Eddie's Potatoes (Diced potato, jalapeno accent, cheese, au gratin) -Lobster Mac & Cheese  Each of the sides could be split three ways if you get a little smorgasbord like we did. They were absolutely amazing. I've definitely eaten comparable sides at weddings/events but I haven't been to a restaurant in PGH that hits the mark so well with all the cheesy goodness that you want in Mac&Cheese and au gratin potatoes.   Personally, I wouldn't get the New Orleans Mixed Grill because after you eat the steak, that's all you really want to eat. You dont want to fuss around with any other meats.   We skipped dessert and actually apps as well because we knew the food was going to be so good.   Only callout is the price - I totally get why the prices are high but it's just not a place that I could go to regularly and not have my bank account yell at me. Highly recommend it though!   -You're able to take leftover food home -Parking in the garage below the restaurant gets validated -They have a coat check",

My fiance and I started out with the steak pot stickers and they were very good. The both of us were extremely happy with our suggested wine selection from the iPad. My fiance got lobster bisque and said there were huge chunks of lobster and the soup was overall perfect.   Since I couldn't convince my lady to split the 30 ounce Waygu with me I opted for the 10 oz filet. THE BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER EATEN. Bar none. We split \"eddie's potatoes\" which are cheesy and delicious. My fiance ordered the filet medallions which come 1 peppercorn (very peppery) 1 bacon gorgonzola , and 1 oscar style. Aside from the peppercorn sauce being a little overbearing, she enjoyed the dish very much  I chose the Peanut Butter Cup dessert, and like the rest of the meal, it didn't disappoint. The presentation was very nice as well.   The ONLY negative to all of this is the price. It certainly won't be a weekly visit for us, but definitely will now be considered any time we want to go somewhere nice for an occasion or when we refer friends to a place to eat in the city.",

I was here for a business lunch meeting but we opted to sit and eat at the bar.  Located downtown, near Gateway Center and close to the Point, this is a great place to go to conduct \"high level business\" or, in my case, much \"lower level business\".    Both me and my lunch partner ordered a salad and the salmon BLT.  This comes with some amazing hot fresh bread.  Tried to be healthy but the bread probably tipped over on the caloric scale.  WORTH IT.  The house dressing with the salad was beyond amazing.  The BLT was probably as perfect as one can get to making a salmon BLT.  Great lunch choice.  It can get pricey so be prepared for that.  Lunch for two with iced tea cost me around $55.",

Our waiter, Jim provided suggestions that you could literally taste as he described. We ordered martinis and Moscow mules that were quenching. Appetizers were the Spinach Artichoke dip and Jim also brought us a complimentary Crabcake to try. (Quick side note, I lived in MD for 7 years and I had to admit, they did the Maryland crabcake justice! It was super meaty, very Lil breading, and seasoned superbly! It was my fav of the night!) All four of us ordered Salads, which was ok but not worth $9.95. The bacon dressing was phenomenal though! My friends ordered the Seabass, King Crab, and scallops ....... which were AMAZING!!!! I personally had the Mixed Grill which included filet, andouille sausage and grilled shrimp, all spiced and rubbed with love lol. It was insane! No one ordered desserts as we didn't want to eat sweets before a night of drinking but we were all pleased with our experience. Monday, Jan 29, to my surprise I received a postcard from the waiter advising how he enjoyed our visit and to keep them in mind for Valentine's Day. I was so impressed I told my husband I definitely wanted to go back and get that crabcake again! Lol Eddie Merlot's is a fantastic venue! I 100% recommend!",

We had about 15 people so they put us in a nice private party room. The service was awesome - from the moment we walked in to the very end when we left. The food was so good! My boyfriend and I had lobster bisque, sweet & spicy rock shrimp, and crab cakes for appetizers. The shrimp was my fave! So good. For entree, the bf ordered the new york strip along with mashed potatoes & creamed spinach (we shared this) and it was perfectly cooked. We're some pretty hard critics when it comes to our steaks but I'm gonna admit -- Eddie Merlot definitely met our expectations and we were so pleased.   Some of my friends ordered the sea bass, others had the filet mignon bone-in, which they all loved as well.   Wish we had room for desserts but we were stuffed by the time we finished our plates! But there's always next time :-) bf starting to love dining here so I can't wait to go back!",

The food is outstanding and the service is beyond excellent. The staff really goes out of their way to make sure that your meal is the finest experience. I enjoyed the filet with some sides - and the steak was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend Eddie Merlot's for a real indulgence!",

    "text": "I ordered the filet mignon sliders and requested the mushrooms on the side, however, they put the onions and the mushrooms on the side all mixed together so I had to pick out the onions and put them on my sandwich. Additionally, the sliders were missing the garlic aioli. Maybe there was confusion because I asked for an additional side of aioli for dipping my fries?  Aside from those minor mishaps, the sliders were cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the waygu steak for $100 and he said he felt it should have been a better cut- more of center cut. It was a little on the thin side and tasted a bit gamey. However, the temperature (rare) was perfect.  We have been here a few times and have always had a great meal. It is definitely solid. In regards to the service, the bartender, Tiffany, is absolutely amazing. She doesn't make mistakes. She is patient, kind, social, knowledgeable, and has a great smile! She let us stay after closing to watch the end of the Pens game too. Pretty awesome!  Overall, definitely recommend it here!",

    "text": "This review has many parts. The atmosphere, the service, the food and the price. 1. The atmosphere: Initially, I liked it. I'd been there when the space was 2 other restaurants and they did well in changing the space. However, as though she was sitting at my table, a woman two tables away could be heard chatting as though she was sitting next to me. She wasn't yelling, but the acoustics were such that we heard the entire conversation all night! A little weird. 2. The service:  I have three parts to this one. Our server, David was very nice. He was funny and helpful. However, part two...there were two managers the night we were there and neither came up to see how things were. I feel that at a restaurant such as this, that would be a common activity. Third...toward the end of the evening, there were other wait staff readying tables for the next day. They were chatting about someone-hoping that person would get whatever it was s/he needed. And they were quite boisterous about this. They continued this conversation as though we were no longer there. Not at all what I would expect. 3. The food was wonderful. From the salad to the sides the dessert and the entrees. Exceptional! The portions were generous and we had dinner for the next night as well. The wine list was wonderful and the two selections we made were stellar!! Thanks to David for helping with that too! 4. The price-well, we have been to all of the higher-end steak restaurants in Pittsburgh and elsewhere. We were a little surprised at the prices here. They were higher than the others and didn't need to be. There were others offerings that some of the others don't always have. But, the prices seemed just too far out of reach. (Examples...chopped salad $14, filet mignon, petite $59.95 as I recall.) The dessert was the deal of the night at only $9.95 for an enormous piece of cake that was very delicious. I have to say-glad I experienced, but I don't need to run back. I didn't get the vibe I get from Capital Grille, Hyde Park or even Ruth's Chris. It just wasn't as warm and inviting as some of the others.",

I had the Peanut Butter Cup. It was incredible. So rich, filling and hit so many points on my palette. I loved it. I would surely come back here even just for dessert! The ambiance was awesome, even the rolling low-sitting comfortable seats made me feel so welcomed and at home. I love this place.",

    "text": "*Business Lunch Meeting Recommendation*  We had a group of 8 to do a sales meeting over lunch, and chose this location to book a private room. I would absolutely host here again in the future. Here's why:  ROOM: Perfect size for 8, maybe even 10 or 12. Hidden in the back corner, quiet and quaint. Had a Samsung TV mounted on the wall and multiple input options (see pic) for presenting.   ENVIRONMENT: Restaurant is classy and impressive. Location is ideal in downtown. Bathrooms have customized hand towels and mouthwash. Steak knives are monogrammed with their brand name. It's little touches like this that show they care about their patrons.   STAFF: Patrick was the best (request him!) He found the perfect balance of being there when we needed him, but also letting us continue business without interrupting. Very attentive and polite.   FOOD: Lunch menu options were great. Lighter fares like salads and sandwiches, but also a few full entrees and steaks. The lobster bisque was my favorite. Also, have them bring fresh whipped cream for your coffee, it was so much better than milk or creamer!",

It was very good except there was too much of some type of sauce (kind of like mayo tasting) under the beef.  I even got my husband to finally try escargot (Bourguignon).  And he loved it!  I knew he would.  Was even dipping the fresh bread into the garlic butter.  We each had the 7 oz filet (cooked to perfection). Mine topped with truffle butter & his w/ bacon gorgonzola cheese.  He also added a bbq bacon wrapped shrimp. Delicious to say the least.  And added the Eddie's potatoes...has a nice mild taste of jalapeno's.  Topped it off w/ creme brulee.  Once again....perfect.  Have to add that our server Armind (sp?) was absolutely wonderful especially with his lovely accent.",

The entree I wanted from their special summer menu was not available which we weren't told until ordering   15 mins for drink delivery. No bread until entrees were served after being requested before the salads were served. No water refills no offers of another drink , waiter disappeared after entrees came and never came back so there was no one to tell that my steak was salty and two other filets were tasteless. A waitress came with dessert menu no clue as to why our initial waiter was gone or her name - no introduction. 3 hr overpriced aggravating meal.",

Quick, knowledgeable, and super friendly.   The food was also great. I got the 7 oz fillet and I added it to be \"Oscar style\" which was great because I am a big crab fan. It also had the sauce and a few pieces of asparagus. We had some sides of mashed potatoes and cauliflower. The prices were what was to be expected. 2 other got the fillets which were all cooked to perfection. 1 person got the cedar plank salmon and it looked delicious. It was a nice size piece also.   The drinks were stiff but great.   We had some cake and creme brulee for desert and everyone enjoyed it. I am sure I will be back at some point. Hopefully sooner rather than later.

    "text": "Walking from our hotel to Eddie's  our excitement grew as we peeked through the big windows. The interior looked so cozy and elegant. We were seated right away and were actually pleasantly surprised at the size of the place. My husband wanted a corner table and hostess had no problem seating us according to our preference. I started out with the beet salad,which was ok but very pretty, the beets could of been more roasted. We then moved on to the oysters which were delicious and perfect. My husband also ordered the baked garlic shrimp as one of our appetizers and he claims it was delicious. I tried a little bit of the stuffing since I don't like shrimp and it was perfectly garlicky. For my entre I decided to splurge and go for the Wylarah Filet Mignon cooked medium plus, and when they brought it out I was a little disappointed at the size, but that's fine dining for you right? However it was a delicious piece of steak! The flavour was perfect and even though I ordered sauce I didn't even end up dipping the steak because the flavour of the beef was delish on its own.  As our sides we ordered asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. I was not too crazy about the cauliflower, but the Brussel sprouts were very very good and I would highly recommend them.  The dessert for two caught our eye, even though we were full, because they prepare it in front of you. We chose the brownie. It was pretty cool how she lit the cognac. The brownie came with raspberries and toasted pecans ( which were delicious ) and topped off with ice cream and hot fudge.Thumbs up for the dessert.  If you want to impress your lady this place is definitely a perfect place to go on a date. Overall I feel like it's just a little bit overpriced on some of the meats. But definitely well worth to check out. Good flavour and great service!",

A group banquet like this is often hit or miss - even for the finest of restaurants, but Eddie Merlot's brushed off the challenge like lint on a suit jacket.  First of all, we were seated in a private room that looked like it could hold up to 75 people and featured floor to ceiling windows.  It is a beautiful setting that accentuates the restaurant's location in downtown Pittsburgh and gave us plenty of comfort to browse around the room and talk with each other.  The room featured 5 top round tables with comfy chairs.  Our appetizers were served buffet style with shrimp cocktail the size of my index finger and an awesome cheese board.  My only complaint was that their cocktail sauce was little more than ketchup.  A steakhouse - let alone an expensive steakhouse - choosing to serve a large group is a disaster in the making, but I was amazed with the quality in presentation that they were able to achieve.  As expected, the alternate entrees were great, but the magic was in the steaks.  Every steak came out well plated, at the right level of doneness, and served hot.  Side dishes were served family style.    The meal was capped off with an amazing caramel and sea salt chocolate cupcake.  Please consider Eddie Merlot's for your next large group event - it may be expensive, but your peeps will love you for it and that is worth any cost.",

I ordered the ribeye steak, parmesan truffles, Brussel sprouts, and added a crab cake for good measure.  I got the Buttercup for desert.  The steak was juicy and tender.  Did it live up to the hype?  I would say it fell a little short, but there was nothing to complain about.  I always love Brussel sprouts, until I had these.  They were soggy and did not have much flavor.  I was expecting Brussel sprouts plus bacon to put this meal over the top, but it too fell short.  The Parmesan Truffles were tasty, but seemed like they sat for a bit.  They were not hot like I like them.  The crab cake was just bad...tasted like it came out of a box and then microwaved. It may be the worst crab cake I ever had.   The Buttercup was tasty and had lots of peanut butter flavor.  I would like to try it again.  The beer list was disappointing.  No beers on draft and limited selection (no IPAs).",

They have a cool wine list on an i-pad and you can click on each wine to see more about it ie: where it's from, flavors, pairings, etc. The food was DELICIOUS! We had the ahi tuna tartare, filet mignon potstickers, and salads -- everything was so good but the two apps were really great. The potsickers were handmade and the portion of the tuna was generous.   Pros: 1. Appetizers were great--multiple people around us ordered the calamari which we didn't try but it comes in this fancy sesame rice bowl! Super neat! 2. Wine selections (obvs) 3. Service  Cons: 1. I think they should put some food on their happy hour menu in the bar--more of a downtown crowd would go. 2. It's pretty fancy in there if you are just out and about downtown you might not feel dressed appropriately (not necessarily a bad thing--unless you are underdressed)",

The lounge area was nice and comfortable and it had a very business like atmosphere. The service was outstanding. The gentlemen knew his stuff and was attentive. He is the main reason I gave three stars. When he was occupied, other staff members would check on us to make sure out drinks were given in a timely manner.   My wife and I ordered and split the best ribeye on the menu (the most expensive version). It was an ok steak but was room temperature after the third bite and cold half way through.   The Alaskan king crab was outstanding.   The complementary bread they serve is kind of a joke.  I would have expected more (better quality and taste) with the amount of money we dropped.   The lobster bisque was $10 and probably the best value. It wasn't any better then other places but I can see why it was only ten as they aren't very generous with the lobster part but again a good value.   The shrimp wrapped in bacon was the worst value. I received 5 pieces of shrimp wrapped in bacon and drenched in BBQ sauce. $19. I couldn't taste the shrimp and barely the bacon. The BBQ overpowers the taste and it tasted like generic BBQ sauce you buy at the store. I would avoid this as tasty as it sounds.   All and all the above, with some drinks and tip ran us about $250. Not sure I would go back unless it was on someone else's tab.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my wife as she had recently gone there with friends and wanted to repeat, and I love aged, prime, steaks.  Our waiter, David H., could have been better...very attentive and guided us through the selection process with honest interpretations to match our tastes.  We were very happy with his advice and our choices.  We shared several appetizers: oysters, fried calamari, and tempura shrimp.  Presentation was excellent and all of these dishes would be repeats in their own right.  My only suggestion is that there is overlap in the tempura aspect on both the calamari and shrimp, so if you are looking for two distinct tastes you may find these too similar...I would get one or the other.  The Caesar salad my wife had was very good. Portion size was ample for hungry diners. They have a nice cocktail menu, decent wine list which we ordered some glasses from, and a reasonably priced corkage policy so I could bring a bottle from my cellar.  For main dishes I had the 16 oz. prime strip, and my wife had the 7 oz. prime filet mignon.  The steaks are aged for 21 days which certainly tenderizes them and I could tell that the strip was indeed prime from the marbled fat content, but I did not detect any aged flavors that one might get at any of the Palm restaurants if you order their 18 oz. prime strip.  I had the hash browns (very flavorful), and my wife had the truffle parmesan fries which were also very tasty, both were generous portions.  For dessert we shared the strawberry shortcake which was excellent, as was the French press coffee.  I would rate this steakhouse concept as excellent and on par with Hyde Park in Pittsburgh.  For comparisons with DC it is certainly better than Ray's the Steaks, and not quite as good as the Palm.  Again, the service was first rate and as good as the best steakhouses I've ever eaten at...thanks to David H., and we will be back.",

My boyfriend and I were walking around downtown the night before Thanksgiving when we decided to stop into Eddie Merlot's for a cocktail and a lite bite to eat. We took a seat at the end of the bar. I should note that there were two bartenders working, one of which was gobbling down what looked like chocolate cake or ice cream. There were less than 10 guests dining in the area. The chocolate devouring bartender approached and gave us a happy hour menu. He then walked away and continued noshing on his food. A couple minutes later the other bartender approached and asked us if we knew what we wanted. There weren't any cocktails that looked appealing to me, so I asked for the wine list. She then walked away and never returned. We gave it a couple minutes, hoping she'd pop back over but we ended up leaving. No water, no drinks, nothing in almost 10 minutes. Very disappointing experience. We made it a point to mention what occurred to the host and some other employee that was standing at the host stand. The other gentleman, not the host, offered to make it up to us. We kindly declined, left and walked over to Morton's for drinks and dinner.",

The location has been difficult for the prior restaurants in this space, as it is just off the downtown grid and not too convenient for those on foot. Valet parking is also right outside, but the indoor parking is very much easier.  Don't let the light crowds these days deter you.  The fare is excellent as is the service.  Ambiance is as good as it gets.  Comfortable for a meeting or for a romantic evening dinner.   The ambiance is far superior.  Conversations are easily heard at the table as the acoustics are excellent.  Overall, the menu and the food is superior to Cap Grille or Morton's.  The bar serves strong generously poured cocktails.

    "text": "My fiance had dinner at Eddie's about 2 1/2 years ago when he was a Sr. Business Analyst for a top company downtown with his colleagues. He raved about how wonderful the food was and the portion size, so I decided to make reservations for my fiance and I for a date night at Eddie Merlot's for February 18 at 8:15. First, walking into the restaurant I thought the decor was okay was not too thrill with the seating. Did not like the chairs (something you would see in a law office's waiting room or a conference room). Our waiter she came over to take our drink ordered I had the Blueberry Mojito and my fiance had Bourbon. The drinks were great! The bread was good, a little on the crunchy side, but that was okay. I wanted the rack of lamb, but they was out of it, so I went with the 12 oz. NY Strip Steak and my fiance had the Trio our sides was Eddie's potatoes, sweet potato casserole, and cream spinach. We both wanted our steaks medium well, but we ended up with medium well at the beginning and the rest was medium rare (very red ). All the sides were very good! Our waiter she did the basic nothing above average. I asked for napkins because myself and fiance do not like using those cloth napkins, she gave me a strange look and said ok I never got the napkins. She never asked if our steaks were cooked to our liking. She did not tell us about any specials or made any suggestions on something to try. Another waiter he told us about a good dessert to try and he was very polite and nice. I hope our waiter did not do this because of our skin color (people always think that black folks do not tip well). She would have got 18% of the total of our check ($35.00), but my fiance gave her $20 for the lack of service. For this to be an upscale restaurant they did not have any bags to put our leftovers (waiter let us know when asked for a bag) us and a few other patrons had to walk out with four or more boxes (us six boxes) of food in our hands, trying not to drop them. The overall experience was okay, would I recommend, probably not and I would never go back again. I had better service at Eat n Park and they always have bags!",

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the sweetest and most welcoming staff who seemed genuinely concerned about our well-being (as we were clearly frozen from our trip to the restaurant). The restaurant is pretty large and we were seated at a table by the window.   My friend and I shared the sesame calamari appetizer which was delicious. The \"bowl\" that it is served in is edible! Additionally, I got a bowl of lobster bisque that was pretty standard. For my entree, I ordered the crab-stuffed shrimp. It comes with four shrimp in a row. Not the most impressive presentation, but the dish itself was fine. However, it is definitely pricey for what you get.   Since my friend was graduating later that semester, they sent over a salted chocolate cupcake. It was a very sweet gesture and we ate half of it (and took the rest back, of course) even though we were so full from our meal. As if that weren't enough, there were also two pieces of complimentary chocolate to end the meal.   The restaurant definitely attracts a more mature crowd. My friend and I were the youngest there by far, but we were still treated like everyone else. Service was excellent.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 5 OVERALL | 4",

I typically like wine with my steak but decided to try their Strawberry Fields Martini. The best martini I've ever had! I don't typically like martini's. I'm more a fruity person and this was amazing.   Next we had oysters. They we're the best I've ever had but they were really good! I've had their crab cakes before and those are probably my favorite appetizer they have.   I also had the chopped salad which is great! The 7oz filet grilled perfectly along with the lobster Mac and cheese. Their Mac and cheese is too cheesy for me? I don't know if that's a bad thing. But it's just too heavy for me. But still good.   I've always been too stuffed to get dessert and have actually never tried any of their dessert.",

    "text": "Phenomenal evening at Eddie Merlot's!! As a couple of broke kids, a fancy dinner doesn't come around too often. My boyfriend has been building the suspense for our anniversary dinner for a while, and it was definitely worth the agonizing wait.   Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated with little wait time. The menu is very extensive, but unfortunately for my vegetarians, the gnocchi is the only vegetarian entree other than salad. However, after speaking with the host, the chefs are able to make off menu items at your request to fit any dietary restrictions - very accommodating!  We couldn't decide between the Parmesan Truffle Fries or the Spinach & Artichoke Dip as a starter, so we did what any logical person would do....we ordered both. It turned out to be a wise choice because both were delicious. The fries were hand-cut and deep-fried to perfection. I shamelessly took more than half my share. The dip was sooo cheesy with huge chunks of artichoke  to dunk in with the golden crispy pita. Excuse me while I wipe my drool from this keyboard.   For the main event, I went with the Vegetarian Gnocchi and the Romaine Waldorf salad on the side. I love fruity salads, and their Waldorf was the best I've had! Everything from the fresh fruit to the subtly sweet vinaigrette was incredible!  As I turned my attention to the gnocchi, I was a little disappointed to find that it was very undercooked; however, I got a fresh plate of perfectly cooked gnocchi once I notified the staff. The sauce had a savory yet sweet alfredo taste. I licked my plate clean because it was that good! My only complaint is that the portion size was a bit too small. I may look tiny, but this girl can eat.   My boyfriend ordered the 16 oz Prime Ribeye Steak as his entree, and he would definitely not recommend it. After requesting the steak to be cooked medium rare, it came out rare. The taste of the meat itself was great; however, the steak was so tough that each bite took the poor kid a solid minute to chew. He built some fantastic jaw muscles that day, but needless to say, he was unimpressed. $50 for a dry, chewy steak? Pass.  Now to my favorite part: let's talk dessert!! After we told our waiter it was our anniversary, we received a complimentary Creme Brulee with a candle on top - adorable! We also ordered the Triple Chocolate Cake which was a mammoth! A bit dry but overall, it was incredible. We tackled what we could, but it got the best of us. Round 2 in the morning!  Last, but certainly not least, our waiter David was unbelievable! I wish I could pack him up and take him home with me. He was so friendly, attentive, and efficient. Whenever I needed him, he was there. Even with the uncooked gnocchi issue, he was able to resolve it quickly and ensured I was happy with the new plate. The man even got us an extra dessert which means he won my heart.   To conclude this very long review, if you can fit an excruciatingly expensive meal into your budget, I would say it's definitely worth the experience of a beautiful evening with good food and great service at Eddie Merlot's!",

Its stained glass decor was sending a beckoning, golden hue onto the street, and it attracted our curiosity.  We were in jeans and boots and almost turned right around when we saw the posh bar design.  But at that moment, a hostess - an elegantly dressed woman in pearls - must have sensed our second-guessing.  She immediately dispelled them.  \"Go ahead, boys.  Have a seat,\" she said as she passed.  Oh, 5 Stars for calling me a boy!  Anyway, the place was sparsely full.  It was the middle of the week.  The bartender served us well then just hung out and talked with us for an hour.  We were out-of-towners and in need of some direction.  He told where to go and when - where not to and why.  When we left we felt like:  if ever back in town, we have \"our spot.\"",

Because she's such a swell chick, we ordered everything that she wanted.  To start, we had: Maryland Crab Cake - Jumbo lump crab, corn relish, Cajun remoulade 15.95(Smack your mama and everyone else, good!  One of my top five favorite crabcakes)  * Filet Mignon Potstickers - Hand-chopped filet, Asian flavors, wonton 13.95(Tasty!  Not Yank Sing-San Francisco good, but tasty) * Sweet and Spicy Shrimp - Tempura shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce 14.95 (Solid dish!  Nothing too fancy and on trend.) * Sesame Calamari - Sesame batter, trio of dipping sauces 14.95. (Superb presentation!  Would have been stellar with some additional seasoning.  Fab sauces accompanying the dish.)  Yeah, I know it's a lot, but my sister was there too...  For entrees, we ordered: Creekstone Farms Pork Chops - Two grilled 10 oz. chops, peaches, roasted garlic mashed potatoes, side Southern Comfort barbecue sauce$ 29.95(Damn!  Where did they get those pork chops?  Flintstone sized juicy pork chops with a smoking sauce.  Yeah!) Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon - Barbecue glaze, roasted garlic aioli, sauteed spinach, fingerling potatoes 31.95 (Perfectly cooked salmon and I mean, perfectly cooked!  Yummy-yummy in my tummy!) Grilled Shrimp - Chimichurri marinated shrimp, wild rice, zucchini, tomatoes, tomato jam 29.95. (Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned and HUGE!  If you are a shrimp lover, this dish is for you)  For sides, we ordered Macaroni and Cheese with Lobster - Five cheese sauce, lobster meat 23.95 and Parmesan Truffle Fries - French fries, truffle oil, Parmesan 9.95.  (Both dishes were actually tasty.  The Mac-N-Cheese could have used a little extra seasoning, but tasty.)  And unlike a lot of restaurants at this price point, they actually allowed me to bring in my own birthday cake and served it to us.  Perfection! I also can't rave enough about how excellent our service was...Again, superb! My bebe was totally pleased and she said that this was her best birthday and one of her best restaurant experiences EVER!    Those statements alone were worth the cost of the meal!",

    "text": "Eddie Merlot's is a classic upscale steakhouse with a few unusual twists. The restaurant is huge and extremely attractive, having been completely remodeled after the failure of several predecessors in the space. The menu is pretty much what you'd expect from such a place, but it also includes unusual items such as sinfully high priced steaks and rarely seen classics like Steak Diane. Someone high up in the chain of command apparently has a streak of pyromania, because in addition to the Steak Diane there is at least one other entre and multiple deserts that are prepared with flames at table side. The wine list is good, not great, with prices in the expected range (i.e. high). Service was satisfactory last night, but the restaurant was empty due to the cold weather, so there wasn't much of a challenge. We ordered the Steak Diane for two and shared the special cheesy potatoes and, believe it or not, the creamed corn, which is not the same as your mother served(e.g. jalapenos are involved). Continuing the flame theme, we shared the bananas foster for desert. The wine was a decent Malbec. All of the food was excellent. Prices, as you would expect, are at the special occasion level, so our return visits will be well spaced.",

I am in town for a conference and am alone on this trip.  My server was Stephen and from the moment I sat down, he was awesome!  It can be intimidating to dine alone in an unfamiliar city.  He made me feel welcomed and at ease.  He offered great recommendations and ultimately I chose the bone-in ribeye, baked potato and French onion soup.  Seriously it was heaven in my mouth!! I'm a major foodie, travel often and eat out way too much, however this place ROCKS!! (And they play great 80's music overhead). I could not have been more pleased!  For health reasons I will probably never return to this great place, but heaven willing, I hope to!    To the owners, managers and staff, I say well done!",

    "text": "We came here Monday night for dinner as part of a large work group dinner. Overall the location was convenient to our offices as well as the hotels at which the out of town guests stayed. The menu had a nice assortment of cocktails and wines. I started off with the berry white martini, which consisted of strawberry and raspberry vodkas, fresh sweet and sour, dekuyper triple sec and fresh berries. It was really sweet and delicious but deceivingly strong (see pic).  Our host selected a group appetizer sampler which consisted of tuna wontons, bacon wrapped barbecue shrimp and prime rib potstickers. All were really good. The shrimp were huge. I also had a French onion soup (okay). For dinner, I selected the 10 oz filet rare. When my entree came out it was actually medium and I needed to send it back. The second time around was perfect. We also ordered a bunch of sides to share--Eddie Merlot's potatoes (okay), Mac and cheese (also okay) and Brussels sprouts.  We wrapped up dinner with some desserts. I passed on dessert as I was already full from dinner but ordered the Eddie Merlot's coffee, which I mistook to be non alcoholic (misread the menu). It was fine but I really just wanted a chocolate flavored coffee.  Overall the food was good but this is not the best steakhouse I have been to.  Service was decent but towards the end of the meal a little slow. Also, in speaking with my coworkers the day after, a few of them feel a little put off by the main waiter. They felt he was a little pushy I getting some of them to order the more expensive entree (vs the ordering off of the Monday night prix fixe menu). Also he got one of my coworkers a second glass of wine when she did not order one. And finally he served out the sides family style when only certain individuals wanted sides. We were a group of 13 and some of my coworkers felt he was up selling to maximize the tab, and ultimately the gratuity.  While I did not pay, I overheard one of the servers tell our boss that they were taking off some of the items from the tab due to some of the steaks not being prepared correctly. I thought that was really nice of Eddie Merlot's to do that!!",

We had filet del mar (topped with lump crab) which came with shrimp and potatoes, plus salad (we had Chef's Favorites), and the other had crab legs, plus creamed spinach and Eddie's potatoes.  Everything was delicious, enough food, with leftovers of both sides.  The server (and up to three help with taking the order, serving and clearing the table) gave us good tips about the sides and desserts--both are big enough for two to three people.

I had never been before so I was very excited. As soon as she gave her name I was not only greeted with a Happy Birthday from the hostess and manager but, a few of the servers actually sang me Happy Birthday. Once they finished we were shown to our table. I was never in this space when it was Palomino's but, it is a very lovely space as Eddie Merlot's  A few seconds later our waiter came and went over the features of the evening. After we had made our selections he brought us some delicious bread to start with. For beverages we all had the lemonade. It was very good and quite refreshing coming in from the summer heat.  For my entree I chose the 16oz Prime Ribeye Steak topped with Bacon Gorgonzola Cheese paired with a Sauteed Crab Cake and Lobster Macaroni and Cheese for my side. My steak was just plain remarkable! It was very tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. The Bacon Gorgonzola Cheese was the perfect addition to the steak as it added a unique flavor to the meal. The Lobster Macaroni and Cheese was exceptional as well. Full of lobster and filled with different types of cheeses.   My wife started off with a Caesar salad which she absolutely loved. For her entree she chose the New Orleans Mixed Grill. It features a 4 oz. Filet Mignon, grilled shrimp, Andouille sausage and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Our daughter got the Filet Mignon topped with steak butter with garlic mashed potatoes as a side. She devoured everything on her plate so I think she was pleased.  After we were finished with our meals our waiter packed the rest of our food to go and even packed us a fresh full loaf of bread to enjoy with it. he also gave us each a Eddie Merlot piece of chocolate that was delicious.   My only two complaints are one like others have said is that I wish the food was served a bit warmer as the AC was on Antarctica so after 15 to 20 minutes our food was getting cold and two it would have been nice to of been offered a birthday dessert or something which I wasn't which to me is strange. Otherwise our waiter has very good the entire evening.   Eddie Merlot's is a chain steak house just like Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Hype Park and Capital Grill but they defiantly bring something different and unique to the Pittsburgh Steakhouse Fine Dining Scene.   Insider Tip: Be sure to park in the garage in the building where Eddie Merlot's is located as they will validate your parking ticket.",

I've been eating here for years now and there is never been even a slight hiccup. He is so attentive, genuine, and educated on the restaurant. His positive energy and exuberant personality makes coming to dine downtown at Eddie Merlots something I look forward to every week. Pat is the best server I've ever experienced and I wish everywhere treated the guest the way I feel treated by him.",

    "text": "Eddie Merlot's seems to be going downhill. This visit was actually my third over the past year. My first experience in the fall of 2017 was for Happy Hour and my friends and I ordered dinner from the Happy Hour menu. Our server was friendly and efficient and our food was good. My second experience was Easter Brunch in 2018. I was looking forward to the lamb that was advertised. Although I like my lamb medium rare, the lamb served on the buffet was extremely rare and not very flavorful. The remainder of the buffet was adequate, but nothing super special. Our service was excellent.   My visit this past week is why I started this review with disappointment. The worst part of the visit was the condition of the restroom. The Ladies Room stunk of urine. Two of the stalls were out of service. The next one I looked in had no toilet paper. Finally I found a stall with toilet paper. There was towel litter strewn across the sink area. It did not appear that anyone had been in to clean the place in quite awhile. All the trash cans were overflowing. The smell was the worst, though. Our servers behind the bar (it was Happy Hour again) were quite rude. There was a lot of confusion over the bill. I wasn't drinking, so I observed what was happening to my friends with a sober eye.   I will be quite hesitant to return based on this last visit. The extremely poor condition of the women's restroom speaks volumes as to the management of the place, in my opinion. I gave three stars because of my past visits, but based on this last experience it would have been a 0.",

But I was a little disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered the potstickers and they were tasty, but the ribeye was just okay. The lobster mac and cheese was okay and so were the Brussel sprouts. Maybe it was just what I anticipated for super high quality food. But I also did not order the more expensive steaks as well. Overall I had a really nice time and will be coming back to try more meats!",

Gordon is polite, friendly, attentive and kind. The menu is a la cart. So prepare to either have a large big or an empty stomach. The wine list is long but like everything else on the menu, expensive.  The sea bass was poorly prepared, just about raw with carrots that were inedible because they were over salted. The ahi tuna was perfectly prepared rare with the smallest of accompaniment of pieces of mushroom and asparagus.  Your water glass will never be empty and you will never feel ignored or forgotten, The service is excellent.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend for his birthday during a weekend trip to Pittsburgh. It was our first time in the city so I did some research to find one of the best steakhouses & decided on this one. I had high hopes but ended up very disappointed.   The food was unimpressive. Not awful but not good either. At a good steakhouse I expect to be wowed. I expect to leave so satisfied that I don't stop talking about how good it was for at least a few hours or even days after. This was not the case here, in fact, after this meal I couldn't stop talking about how much I didn't like it. The food did not have much flavor, we needed to add salt & pepper to everything (something I usually never do).  The beef carpaccio & Brussels bored us. Our rib eyes lacked that buttery melt-in-your-mouth juiciness & flavor. If only the rib eyes were tastier I would have been happy & not cared much about the apps & sides, but as the main event, the steak should not be mediocre. We did enjoy the Mac n cheese, Caesar salad, & the warm bread & fluffy butter was delicious (maybe the best part).   The waiter was not friendly & seemed to be struggling to put a smile on his face. He seemed annoyed with my very first question about a Cabernet & responded by avoiding my question & instead offering an answer to a question I did not ask. He seemed rushed, stressed out & overwhelmed. As someone who has worked as a waistress before, I can sympathize with the feeling but I would know better than to ever let that stress show to my customers. He made us feel like we shouldn't ask too much of him or it would just worsen the situation. So we tried to go easy on him.   After we finished the meal, we were finishing our drinks & I started to feel a horrible pain in my stomach. I ran to the bathroom & had diarrhea. It was extremely upsetting that I just spent almost $300 on a meal that made me feel awful. I'm assuming it was the beef carpaccio but it's hard to be sure. In conclusion, it was a pretty terrible experience.",

I just gained 10 pounds from dinner tonight and I am one satisfied customer.  1st time eating here and everything that I ordered was delicious.  The  complimentary loaf of bread was warm and very tasty.  The wedge salad was amazing - hands down one of the best salads I've ever had in life.  Then I ordered the bone-in filet mignon.  It was seasoned just right and the outside seared to perfection.  Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water.  Even their brussel sprouts were delicious!  For dessert I got the bananas foster and it was made right in front of me!  (See video below)  The service was top notch.  Our waiter, Armindo, kindly explained the specials and what he recommended on the menu.  Even paired our meal with a great cabernet wine.  The venue was very intimate, very classy decor.  Wonderful place for date night.  Pretty pricey but worth every penny!  I came here for a work event so after dinner, my colleague and I hung out at the bar to recap the night.  Our bartender was excellent.  Great conversationalist and gave us lots of tips regarding the Pittsburgh area.  He even gave me a free slice of carrot cake on the house!  If you know me, sweets are the way to my heart and Eddie Merlot, me and you are going steady from now on!",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. I held off writing my review hoping nostalgia might set in and some of the edge could be taken off, but to no avail.   As my wife and I entered we were very impressed with the decor and ambiance and both mentioned the superior aesthetics. We were promptly greeted by our server, Tim I believe, who took our drink orders and said he'd be back with the specials; great energy, charismatic, we were preparing for a wonderful dining experience with Tim as our guide.   He returned a few minutes later with our drinks, their version of a mule for me and a glass of moscato d'asti for my wife. As Tim read the specials, my wife was convinced of the surf and turf, crab legs and a filet. Tim mentioned varying sizes of steaks and seafood portions in case you wanted more of one or less of the other so my wife said she wanted the smallest filet cut (more on this later) I had my heart set on the platinum cut wagyu ribeye ordered Pittsburgh rare.   While waiting for our entrees, our French onion soup and wedge salads arrived, both of which were fantastic, the soup being some of the best I've had. As we sampled our drinks, my wife mentioned her wine not tasting right, more like a Pinot and also noted it did not have the characteristic bubbles of the d'asti. When we brought this to Tim's attention, he commented that he's not sure what happened, he poured the bottle himself. He took the glass and moments later an older gentleman, guessing a manager, came out with a new bottle and all was right.   Out come the steaks, seemingly cooked to perfection. My wife's filet was tender and the crab legs were cooked well also. At first glance of my steak, I noticed it was bone in, which the menu had not mentioned (for the ribeye, but the NY was bone in). I cut into the steak and although it was cooked perfectly, something was off, did not \"feel\" or look like a traditional ribeye, the steak really seemed to be a NY strip. (Having grown up in a butcher shop you tend to to notice fat/bone placement and can identify cuts) I asked Tim if I received the correct steak and he assured me that I had.   The rest of the meal went well, the wife had a delicious creme brulee and I opted out of dessert. When the time came to settle the check, I noticed the bill had a charge for Pinot, the wife's filet was upgraded to their platinum cut wagyu without our knowing (it was the smallest cut filet, however one would assume a $40+ upgrade should at least be brought up) , and my steak charge read NY strip. (Tim said there wasn't a key for wagyu ribeye in their system, that they have to ring it in a NY and tell the kitchen ribeye, seems hard to believe for an upscale restaurant).   As I mentioned, I really wanted to like this place but the oversight of details, the hidden upcharge, and the incorrect cut of steak really left a bad taste in my mouth for a meal of that grandeur. If I'm going to pay that kind of money for a dinner for 2 I expect perfection, or at least a little more consideration when things aren't right.   The search for the best steak in Pittsburgh continues, such is life.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriend cane here for our one year anniversary dinner and this place is wonderful! I was a little hesitant because of the poor reviews and it being a bit pricy but let me say that's not the case. I feel like a bad server most certainly could ruin the dinner here but ours was amazing. On walking in to check in with our reservation they greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary. That was pretty cool and super thoughtful I thought. On sitting the table was super well set and right by the window so that was really nice. We don't go out to eat at super fancy places a lot so we decided to go big or go home. I'm not big into drinking but my date had some wine and it was nice that they brought over a glass to feel the wine glass and left some in there for a refill. We started with the bread appetizer and it was so good and fresh and the dusting was so good on top. Next we had the spinach and artichoke dip and omg it was the best I've ever had so fresh and flavorful. Next we had the candy bacon and holy freaking molly the flavor was unreal! The plating looked great and the sauce was wonderful. For dinner I ordered a 45 day dry aged New York strip I think it was. It was amazing and cooked perfectly and soft soft and tender. Had to get a side of the crab legs and omg to die for the melted butter and how they where split it just made it that much better. My date had the vegan pasta and she said it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. We got sides of Mac and cheese and cheesy potatoes. The Mac and cheese sucked but the potatoes now where so good. Needless to say we crushed everything. For desert we had the carrot cake. It was so good and fresh and was the best I've ever had all the fresh fruit played so well together. One thing to mention is I was hot sauce for the potatoes and Mac and the guy looked at my funny but was able to get me some so that was great. Overall this restaurant was amazing and I'm so happy we came here. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect dinner. I can't wait till we come back and pig out again on all the delicious food.",

However lately they have changed the menu and made it much more expensive and less bar friendly most certainly. The removed the cheeses and charcuterie and the smaller carpaccio and other appetizers and now it is quite pricey to even just sit and have a drink. A poor decision to me. I can afford to eat anywhere so price is not an issue but rather value. In regards to the food. I love the Beet Salad, just an incredible dish and well presented and great for sharing. I usually will have the Medallion Trio which is three filet mignons each prepared differently, one peppercorn, one gorgonzola cheese topping and one with crabmeat and bernaise sauce along with a twice baked potato. Great for sharing. Their special app is the Bacon wrapped BBQ Shrimp which honestly though tasty, I have found to be a bit chewy. I do need to comment on the service. The best around Tiffany and the two Michaels behind the bar Andy and Jeff are among my favorite servers. This place can be pricey but if you do it right and share plates (there is a lot of food in each serving) it can be reasonable.",

We were so excited to sit at the bar and experience this new restaurant in Pittsburgh. We sat at the bar while three bartenders stood around conversing amongst themselves, looked over at us and then looked away! We sat there for at least another minute or so while continuing to be ignored when we finally called a bartender over to take our drink order. She never asked if we wanted menus so another bartender gave them to us after we asked. We ordered the calamari, which was tempura battered, fried and greasy. Needless to say it was not good. I ordered a moscow mule and it wasn't served in a copper mug...disappointing. The whole experience didn't end quickly enough and suffice it to say, we will not be going back. I have owned a business for 10 years and I would never think to treat my clients like we were treated. The whole atmosphere left a lot to be desired. With the many wonderful restaurants to choose from in Pittsburgh, one would think the \"new kid on the block\" would be trying a little harder to attract a clientele, not turn them off.",

I can't say enough about the taste and quality of the food.  We both had the \"summer grill\" for $89 for two - had the 7oz filet mignon, salad and veg.

From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out we loved the experience.  The decor and staff were both awesome. Keep reading to find out why I went all 5 stars...  We had the bacon as an appetizer.  After smelling it go by our table to the one next to us, we didn't really have a choice.  We had to have it.  It was sweet and salty, everything you could want in candied bacon.  It was out of this world.  My main course was the Trio of Filet.  I really loved the idea of having Filet prepared 3 different ways in one sitting.  It did not disappoint.  The steak was cooked to perfection!  I don't know that I can pick a favorite.  For our side we had Eddies Potatoes.  Like everything else they were awesome...  By this point, you are tired of hearing awesome awesome awesome BUT the best part for everyone at our table was the dessert!  I have been on the hunt for a dessert place in the Burg.  Let me tell you, for as much as I loved the rest of the food, the dessert is the reason for my 5 star rating.  I would honesty be willing to go back just to have dessert and the orange Manhattan.  We literally had trouble deciding what to get because everything we saw around us looked so good.  I ended up with the peanut butter cup and my wife had the chocolate cake.  Both were melt in your mouth happiness!  I was so full but it tasted so so so very yummy that I couldn't stop eating.  Oh, the drinks were strong and full of flavor... have the orange Manhattan.  You will not be disappointed.  Did I mention the Burnt Orange Manhattan???  Finally, the location can't be much better if you like to hang out and enjoy the city after dinner.  There are plenty of public spaces to hang out these days but none better than the point at night.  I had too many Manhattans to consider driving right away.  Point State Park is a block away.  We strolled through and hung out by the water for a while.  The city really is beautiful from down there.  By the way, if you are from Pittsburgh and don't make an entire night of hanging out in the city when you head in for dinner then you are missing out.  Honestly, find a park, sit down, take in the city, and enjoy the night.  We have a beautiful city, it deserves your attention.  And have the Burnt Orange Manhattan at Eddie Merlot's... and dessert....",

Also, an extremely hospitable wait staff ready to cater to any need you may have.   But when it came to the food, our experience was no better than average. The sweet and spicy shrimp had an addicting taste; however the presentation left much to be desired. It was depicted as a tipped over Chinese takeout box. Not fitting for a restaurant alleged to be a fine steak seafood establishment. For the main course, both mine and my husbands steaks were overdone, but still enjoyable. However, things were looking up by dessert. The vanilla cognac brownie was fantastic, and worth having over and over.   Overall, an experience that was no better, no worse than your average steakhouse. Not expecting to return, given other options within the city.  Here are some items that could improve the experience: - steak knives should only be placed on table when guest orders steak.  - takeout box with chopsticks on shrimp appetizer should be changed as it degrades the dish.  - staff should have clean aprons, some aprons looked well used.  - dress code should be put into effect. No one enjoys dining in an upscale environment with others wearing ball caps.  - staff should be given better lighters when providing table side service (a bright red Bic lighter found at your local gas station, isn't ideal).  - if you have signature Napkins in the restrooms and signature steak knives on the tables, why not have branded signature pens for guests to sign their checks with?",

    "text": "My husband and I were staying at the Wyndam Grand and were hungry since we never ate lunch. After checking on Yelp, I found the great reviews on this restaurant and it was 1 block away. It was 445 when we walked in and we're seated right away. That is when we knew we made the right decision....One word.....PAT! As soon as we met our waiter Pat we knew we were going to have a great experience! After browsing the drink menu we both chose some tasty drinks. I chose the Berry White Martini and it was one of best drinks....ever. I could have had a dozen of them lol. For dinner we ordered off the dinner for 2 menu for $65 it is a great deal.  I ordered the Filet and Salmon combo with the house salad.  The salad came out within a few minutes and was a good portion. The entrees were out about 15 minutes later.   The salmon literally melted in your mouth and had phenomenal flavor! The filet was good as well but I really enjoyed the salmon over the filet which is odd because I am a huge lover of filet. I would order just the salmon next time. The garlic mashed potatoes were good and so was the broccoli. Halfway through the meal Pat came over and offered to get me another drink which I was going to order the same Martini but he insisted on making me a surprise one. I'm kind of a picky drinker so I was a bit nervous but he assured me if I did not like what he brought he would bring me another Berry White Martini. When the drink showed up and I had my first taste I was immediately in love with it... just a raspberry martini but with two different vodkas in it made my taste buds dance! Throughout the meal Pat would give us tips on where to go and what to see and what to do for our one night here he was extremely pleasant and very attentive! He even chose our dessert for us bringing over Creme Brulee that we devoured in just a few minutes. While sitting at the table I was already telling my friends whenever they come to Pittsburgh they need to come and visit Pat and have a great dinner! Next time we are in the city we are definitely stopping in to visit! thank you Pat for making our Saturday night that much better!",

My husband and I go to one steakhouse each restaurant week and this time, he picked Eddie Merlot's. If he were writing this review, he would definitely give Eddie Merlot's a solid 5 star review. For me, I thought it was good, but I feel like we've had better.   In terms of ambience and service, Eddie Merlot's was great. We were seated right by a fireplace, which was perfect for the bitter cold night we stopped in.   Food-wise, we ordered candied bacon and Caesar salad for appetizers, bone-in filets and Eddie's potatoes for entrees, and chocolate cake and chocolate pots de creme for dessert. The candied bacon was phenomenal and the steak was prepared and seasoned perfectly. However, the potatoes were disappointing. Flavoring of the potatoes was on point, but they were undercooked. I just wasn't expecting crunchy cheesy potatoes. Desserts were okay and didn't blow me away. I do want to give a mention to the bread, though. It had a crunchy, garlicky exterior and was perfectly warm and pillowy on the inside.   Overall, I'd probably come back, but I'd skip the potatoes and maybe stop somewhere else for dessert.",

Perhaps a more flavorful sauce or some more spice.   Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meal however. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dish.

The Bartender was exceptionally friendly and made our night that much more fun with just being kind and attentive. We had Filet, lobster tails, scallops, some kind of wonderful cheesy potato & broccoli for dinner. Not to forget we started with oysters which were also excellent!  Dessert may have been the best part of the meal.. on their holiday menu there was a chocolate sampler which had every chocolate dessert in the house one one plate. I would come here just for that alone! It was a \"wow\" dining experience!  We stayed here for quite a while knowing that it would be hard getting in anywhere else for New Years.. well this was not a mistake, because by the time we left there was a band playing right in the heart of town a few steps away from this restaurant, and by Midnight there were fireworks that could be seen to all that were dining here. What a treat!",

I ordered the 7 oz. filet and it was perfectly cooked. My husband went with the salmon and absolutely loved it. I ordered a baked potato on the side (which cost extra), but it was worth it. The potato was huge and we were able to split it down the middle. It came with sour cream, butter, bacon, and chives on the side (no upcharge for any of it).   We both went with the chocolate cake for dessert. As a chocoholic, I can  say with confidence that it was delightful. Even my husband, who isn't typically a dessert man, said that it was amazing cake.   Our server was attentive and helpful. Our glasses were never empty and we weren't sitting around waiting for the check.   Overall, we had a great experience and were happy to note that even though the prices were significantly discounted, the service and quality of food were not.",

The decor of this restaurant is honestly really beautiful and very fancy. I enjoyed it a lot. We decided to start our meal by splitting some calamari. Unfortunately, the calamari was very airy and there was not a lot of meat. We expressed this to our waiter and he willingly took it off of our bill which we appreciated. As for meals, I ordered the sea bass and then our table split the lobster mac and cheese for the side. The sea bass was fresh and delicious. It came with a very refreshing sauce that I thought complimented the fish as well as the vegetables it came with. I would recommend this dish to any seafood lover! As for the lobster mac and cheese, we really enjoyed it but we actually had a manager approach our table and tell us that he thought it was lacking an adequate amount of lobster. He said he was taking it off the bill as well. We were very surprised by that and appreciated that he cared so much. Additionally, they knew there was a graduate our table and even brought out a free dessert to celebrate! It was a great and unexpected surprise.   The only reason I am rating it four stars is because of the \"skimpy-ness\" of those two dishes. Other than that, I enjoyed my visit.",

We had the artichoke dip as an app and it was really good, especially the pita bread that came with it. For dinner, I had the filet with the shrimp and the mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed this although  my husbands entree came with seasoned shrimp and I will say his was better since it was so flavorful!   The salad the dinner came with was also really good. They make all there dressings in house, I would definitely order again.  We absolutely loved the hot bread before dinner too. Just a tip,  sit in the lounge before dinner during their happy hour specials! I believe it was $3 off wine and cocktails .  Our waiter was very helpful. We advised we were heading to a show at Heinz hall at 7, and he did a really good job moving us along so we were able to make it on time. He even told us next time to park there since they do validate parking.  Overall, I really would enjoy a trip back to Eddie Merlot's.",

    "text": "Oh. My. God. I am so SO overly impressed with my experience at Eddie Merlot's.  We came on a Monday night and had reservations for 5:30. We had made these reservations the day of so I'm surprised we got in. Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly smile from the host. They must have taken note that it was our anniversary so everyone who saw us along the way to our table made sure to wish us a happy anniversary. I thought this gesture was so sweet and kind! When arriving at our table, the gentleman kindly pulled my chair out for me to sit. He was sure to let us know that our server will be over shortly and quickly went over the menu with us. Neither my boyfriend or I had been here before so we didn't know where to start! I don't eat meat, so I was on the lookout for any vegetarian or vegan options. They actually had a ton to chose from! I was shocked because this place is know for their steaks and meats.   When our server, Ziad came over, he introduced himself and asked if we had any further questions regarding the menu. He took my drink order and promptly came back with my glass of Merlot. It was fantastic! I'm usually not a dry wine gal, but this wine was great. And I love that they even give you an extra serving of it when they pour it.   Now time for the food. My boyfriend and I hardly take super fancy dinner dates, so we decided to make this one count. We started off with the Spinach and artichoke dip. It came out about 15 minutes later and oh my god it was to die for. It was served with warm pita chips that were lightly salted with sea salt and it was the perfect touch. The dip itself was outstanding and actually came out at the perfect temperature. It looked like it was going to be too hot, but once you bit into the cheesy artichoke hearts, it was all perfect.  Next was time for the main course. My boyfriend took advantage of the Restaurant Week special they were running and got some meat-based dishes. I didn't try any of his food but he said they were the best he's ever had. I chose the Vegetarian Bucatini. And I'm SO glad I did. We also ordered a side of Eddie's potatoes & a side of Mac n Cheese (go big or go home right?)   The Bucatini. Wow. I can't even begin to describe the flavor that erupted in my mouth within that first bite. A perfectly portioned size pasta dish with a butternut squash puree served with garden fresh veggies. The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture and was accompanied by the right amount of puree. The vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, and mushrooms) were all so tender and delicious. The dish, as a whole, was the best dish I have EVER eaten in my life.   Can't forget about the potatoes & mac n cheese. The Mac n Cheese was subpar. The crumbled bread crumbs gave it a nice texture but there wasn't anything super distinct about the flavor. Eddies potatoes though were so delicious. They were spiced so delicately and packed a flavorful punch of jalapeno cheddar. I would definitely get the photos it's again!   We finished the meal with a slice of carrot cake. I had never tried carrot cake before so I didn't know what to expect. And let me just tell you, this cake blew my mind. Between the carrot, the pineapple, and the icing, it was just so flavorful and comforting. The perfect end to the most amazing meal I've ever had.   All in all, I would give Eddie Merlot's a 6/5 if I could. The whole experience was so amazing and I can't WAIT for my next trip here. Between the service, the attention to detail, and the food, Eddie Merlot's is now my favorite place to dine.",

Maybe I was set up for disappointment because of the hype or because the prices imply something special. The food was good, but nothing memorable. Once again, I found myself watching others eat, because after careful iteration of my need for a gluten-free meal and reassurance from our waiter, my meal arrived with bread covering half the plate. IMHO, at a restaurant of this caliber, this calls for management to offer an apology. At least offer a small salad while I wait for my meal to be remade.",

Meaning, they had spiced cherry moscow mule, instead of just plain mules. Prices ranged from $9-16.   For dinner, our waiters name was Gordon. He did a great job entertaining us and he enhanced the experience by having good conversations. We didn't leave until 11 PM.   I had the medium rare 7oz BMS 9+. With Brussels sprouts, asparagus, creamy corn, and french fries. The steak didn't meet my expectations, it didn't hold its structure in the middle and was somewhat spongy, medium rare shouldn't do this, the flavor was good, but not worth $100. The brussel sprouts and asparagus were not over seasoned or cooked and retained some of their natural flavor and healthiness, which was a relief.   For dessert we had the carrot cake, peanut butter cake, and banana foster. All were very good. The banana foster is cooked table side, but I think the presentation was underwhelming and didn't constitute preparing table side.   Overall this is a great place for food, great conversation, and atmosphere.",

However what makes me give 5 stars is the service. Rheanna was one of the best servers I've ever had. She knew when to make her presence known, and when to let me and my best friend enjoying restaurant week to ourselves. I was even more blown away when she made it a point to quickly gather our desserts to go and get our check taken care of promptly, as we were in a rush. The thing that impressed me the most was that she respected two 20 something year olds who were just casually trying to enjoy a nice evening out, always checking in on us and being super friendly the whole time. I've been here once before and was super impressed the first time with my server. I'm pleased to learn the service really lives up to its name. Rheanna and her other service members were awesome. I'll absolutely be back to enjoy!",

At the end of our meal she handed us the checks and didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. Then once we were done w dessert, she was no where to be found and we waited about 15 minutes before she showed back up. The manager never even stopped by our table to see how we were doing but he stopped at other tables. We ordered two appetizers, a bottle of wine, wagyu steaks (which were not worth it) and two desserts. The quality of the food was not worth it and the service was appalling. To say that I would never go back or recommend this place would be an understatement. I would 100% recommend that you go to Eddie V's or Morton's if you want a real meal with real service.",

The dining tables have just enough space between them so it gives a great dining-out vibe while at the same time does not prevent having intimate conversations within one table. I loved that! I feel like this is an important aspect which a lot of restaurants are missing.  We ordered four different salads and all were great. For our entree we ordered beef steaks (different cuts) and the buffalo. All were juicy and tasty (we ordered medium rare and they came out just right). For desserts we had the chocolate and carrot cake. I felt the carrot cake was a little too sweet though. Also, we wanted to get espresso, but they said the machine is broken which I find a lame excuse for a restaurant like this (cannot they just buy one for reserve? I am sure Eddie Merlot can afford this) . But it did not matter that night since we had a great experience dining here, both food and service wise.",

The brussel sprouts were amazing however, and the mac and cheese was also to die for. For dessert I had the bananas foster and WOW was it good. Pricey for sure, but well worth it if you are looking for a nice meal. Definitely one of my new favorites.",

The aha tartare was delicious, the lobster bisque had some meat, the short ribs were tender, the sea scallops were good, the crab cakes had too much bread in them and not enough meat, the filet mignons were cooked to our liking, and the asparagus was cooked and seasoned well. The waiter was nice. When our entrees were brought out, we were asked if we needed anything else. We asked for salt and pepper. 15 minutes later, we still did not have our salt and pepper, so we had to ask a second time.",

John, our waiter, was attentive and kind.  The room is beautiful and comfortable.  The lobster bisque was superb.  The issue was the preparing of the steaks.  This seems to be a common complaint on here about Eddie Merlot's.  Three people ordered steaks medium-well.  All three came medium-rare and were sent back.  They offered to butterfly them to which we all agreed.  They came back out without being butterflied and warmer, but not any more done.  Two things: I don't understand what is so difficult about cooking a steak to the desired temperature and secondly, if this sentiment has been expressed repeatedly on Yelp, why isn't Eddie Merlot's addressing it?  For the price, and make no mistake about it, this is one of the most expensive restaurants in the city, I was disappointed.",

Dinner was a ribeye, mixed grill, filet and the trio of medallions. No one was disappointed-everything was cooked spot on.

Was staying across the street so we walked over on a Friday night right when they opened. Greeted by 2 very friendly gentlemen and taken to our table, a nice big round booth. I think we had the best waiter ever... His name was Don. Super attitude, funny, attentive and a great voice!!! Food was to die for. Best oysters I've ever tasted (clean-no grit). I had the bison filet, delish. Husband had NY strip, perfectly cooked. We had several apps including the steak tartar... This was also wonderful. The wine was good. The cocktails were good. We made the mistake of ordering carrot cake that could have fed 6 people!!! We ended up giving 3/4 to friends of ours who were having dinner at the next table. Although the name of this place is not as widely known as Cap Grille, Mortons or Ruth's, it far surpasses all of them in my opinion!",

Next,  we got our entrees. My 14oz NY strip was good but not great. I wouldn't put it before Hyde Park,  capital grille or Ruth chris's.  On the other hand,  my girlfriend's spare rib meat loaf was amazing. The spare rib was in the center and was very tender. They piled mashed potatoes as high as the meat loaf to make it level for the friend onions. Keep in mind this was for lunch and the portion was enormous.  We will be back for lunch and one if not both of us will be getting the spare rib meat loaf. I almost forgot,  my girlfriend wanted to surprise me so she went to talk to the hostess and asked to have a desert brought to me. My girlfriend asked for something  red velvet (my favorite)  and sure enough they brought out a red velvet cupcake with butter cream icing. Oh and a cold shot of milk. It was complimentary as well! We enjoyed our time at Eddie Merlot's!",

It was my first time dining here and I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience. The environment is bright, open, and well decorated. The service was excellent and very accommodating.   We started off by sharing the shrimp flatbread, which our server recommended and it was quite tasty! I also ordered a cup of the lobster bisque, which was amazing, full of flavor and actually had substantial lobster meat. Next, I opted out of ordering the burger that caught my eye, as the soup was more filling than I expected, and went on a lighter route with the Southwest Chicken Caesar salad. The salad was okay, but nothing spectacular.  The ingredients were fresh, but were completely drowning in the dressing.  Next time, I will be sure to order it on the side- or go with the burger instead.  It was a bit pricey for lunch, especially for a sub par salad, but I am looking forward to give it another try!",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to check out Eddie Merlot's, so when Pittsburgh restaurant week came around, I grabbed the opportunity!  In case you haven't checked out Pittsburgh Restaurant week in the past (and if you haven't, you must next time!), you usually get a smaller menu to choose.  You get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for a set price. The restaurant week menu was pretty fair I thought, and the right price!, $35 for 3 courses compared to around $40 for just the steak.  Yep, it's an a la carte place, so be prepared.  My first course was absolutely delicious.  I chose the Caesar salad and it was a VERY generous portion.  The fresh ground pepper really took it over the edge.  They also delivered out a warm mini round loaf of bread for us to enjoy, which was quite tasty.    For my entree, I chose the steak diane option.  Now I know what steak diane is and all, but for a fancy restaurant I thought the presentation was really lacking.  It looked like they had opened a can of wet dog food and poured it over mashed potatoes.  Luckily it tasted WAYYY better than it looked!  The steak was tender, melt in your mouth, with a wonderful gravy enhancing the steak's own flavor.  The mashed potatoes were thick, creamy, with just the right amount of chunks.  It would have been nice to have a vegetable on the plate as well, but alas, it was a restaurant week special.  If it wasn't ridiculously expensive, I'd love to come back and have a True steak.  For dessert, I had the carrot cake which was an overall small portion, but was just perfect after all the food I had already consumed.  More sweet than spicy carrot cake with a just right cream cheese frosting.  Loved the pineapple in the cake that added that extra sweetness and acidity!  The service was amazing.  Definitely a wine place, not a beer place.  Nothing is on tap and the only problem with the service was that the waitress did not seem to be very familiar with the beer list.  With craft brews becoming more and more popular, I would expect even a steakhouse to have a few that the staff can assist you in picking from.  Overall, it was a good, but not amazing, restaurant week menu and experience.  Would I go again?  Certainly not for full price, and most likely not for restaurant week.  I would hope that next time restaurant week rolls around their menu would be more similar to other steakhouses in Pittsburgh with more options.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife for dinner.  Having been in this place during its two previous restaurants, I was eager to see what changes, if any they had made.  I was not to be disappointed as Eddie Merlots had left the floor plan of the restaurant the same but they really did a good job on updating the decor of the place.  This was especially True in the chandelliers as well as the mosaics that were hanging along the walls.  For dinner my wife and I decided to start out the evening with the sesame calamari appetizer while she also chose to order the lobster bisque soup.  Thankfullly my wife was kind enough to save me one of the larger pieces of lobster in her bisque as well as some broth from it so that I could try it.  I have to admit that it was pretty good with the lobster being cooked perfectly and the bisque being seasoned nicely.  I also really enjoyed our calamari which came with three different sauces: a garlic/ginger soy sauce, ahot mustard sauce and a wasabi sauce.  The calamari was also cooked perfectly as the outside breading had a nice crunch while the inside was soft and chewy and not rubbery at all.  For my dinner entree I had a hard time deciding between the 16 oz. bourbon-marinated ribeye steak and the bison filet mignon.  My choice ultimately ended up being the bourbon-marinated filet which I made after consulting with our server.  My wife ended up going with the steak frites for her entree and we decided to split a side order of the macaroni and cheese.  The bourbon marinated steak ended up being quite large, tender and very good.  You could really taste the bourbon in and it gave the steak a subtle sweetness while at the same time giving it a bit of a bite which I had never had in a steak before.  The macaroni and cheese also ended up being good although it didn't have anything special that stood out to me.  After all of that food we still somehow had a little room for dessert and so we ended up ordering the carrot cake.  The piece that they gave us was absolutley humongus and could have easily been shared by a table of 4.  I ended up enjoying it as it tasted how I thought a carrot cake should.  With the dessert finished and the bill paid we ended up getting our parking validated at the hostess station and left the restaurant quite full but also a bit lighter in the wallet.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  The service that we received here was quite good and the food was as well.",

Cooked perfectly, with cream spinach and sweet potato casserole it was more good than I needed to eat...but I finished every bite. Wife had Alaskan Salmon, she said it was wonderful as well and then we split a peanut butter cup dessert that had the consistency of cheesecake but all the peanut butter flavor of a Reese's. Valentines Day dinner was perfect, wait staff was very professional and attentive.",

    "text": "Disappointing. After a great experience  during restaurant week ,my husband and I came back  for our anniversary. Our service  was slow, the waiter was no help in recommending anything on the menu, just said \"everything is good and it is my favorite menu.\" When we finally got the chance to place our order, the table beside us spilled a drink so he stopped taking our order when we were in mid-sentence  to clean it up. Instead of flagging someone else he continued to help the other table including going to get more napkins and new beverages for the group. This is after we had been waiting over 25 minutes with no bread or drinks besides water.  We decided to split the wagyu ribeye  for two along with mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. While the steak was good, we certainly weren't blown away. The sides were really basic and my husband even commented that the mashed potatoes I make at home were more flavorful than the ones they served us!   We were expecting a little bit of extra fanfare since we made it known that we were celebrating  a special occasion but unfortunately our experience was sub par.",

I'm not a huge fan of steak, so I never like it when I am invited to these types of restaurants. You know the places where everything on the menu is \"aged to perfection,\" ala carte, costs $60, and is the size of a golf ball. That being said, Eddie Merlot's did have some reasonably priced menu options to choose from in addition to the steak.  I had the barbecue braised short ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and a caesar salad. The meat was prepared perfectly! It was fork tender and the sauce was delicious. I enjoyed every bite.   The down side was that the overall service was very slow for the number of people in the restaurant at the time.   As a side note that I did not include when giving my rating, everything that my party ordered looked great, but some of the entree portions were unreasonably small.",

    "text": "My girlfriend suggested this place for our pre theater meal. Fantastic Service & Fantastic Food! We sat at the bar and had a glass of wine before our meal the bartenders were Super nice and friendly. Off to a good start. Our waiter was very knowledgable and gave us the rundown of the specials and his recommendations. We started of with the filet pot stickers. The size was perfect and they were really flavorful. So picking the appetizer was easy but now comes the hard part deciding on an entree. So we decided on the Louisiana sampler which came with a 7oz filet andouille sausage mashed potatoes and choice of soup and salad . Since they do not offer a side salad the waiter was kind enough to have the kitchen split the wedge salad for us. My friend ordered a side of Brussels sprouts and I was agonizing between the truffle parmesan fries or the lobster mashed potatoes . Now for anyone who follows my reviews has to know I haven't met a fry I didn't like lol. Soooooo I went with the fries. I'm definitely gonna try those mashed potatoes next time. My filet was cooked perfectly it sliced like butta! The fries we're seasoned to perfection. Yes I know we ordered a mound of food needless to say we had tons of leftovers. The side dishes at the place are meant to be shared. So we're both stuffed and our waiter offered us the dessert menu I readily replied Bring It!! Lol they have tons of treats to pick from and I decided on the peanut butter pie. I took one bite and was like YASSSSS !!!! The peanut butter filling was silky smooth not overly sweet. Just the right amount of crust and chocolate. So needless to say this place is worth every penny!",

    "text": "Alright Pittsburgh, another new, great restaurant for our fair city. Dined here twice so far so I think I can write a fair and informed review and I expect I will be here many more times to come. Eddie Merlot's is a, very good and lovely to look at, Steakhouse and more. High on looks, high on service, high on price, high on the palate. Worth it all, when you want to splurge.  So far I have had the pleasure to enjoy the 22 oz Prime Bone-in Ribeye Steak and the 18oz Prime Dry-aged New York Strip Steak. Both steaks were delicious and very highly representative of the best of their cuts. Perfectly cooked to medium rare and with such moistness and flavor. Have had the East coast and West Coast Oysters on the half. They were very fresh, flavorful and nicely presented. A word to the shucker, only one issues was a little too much chipped shell included done at shucking time.   Starting also with soup and salad, I tried the Merlot's wedge and then the Chopped Salad. Both were outstanding, but watch for the Chopped Salad containing: Crisp lettuce, Gruyere cheese, red onion, celery, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, crispy prosciutto, and seasoned almonds, with creamy herb dressing, to be very large and filling. A companion liked the French Onion soup enough to order it on two visits. All the sides we tried were pretty good, mostly everything is a la carte so you pick em as you like and have room for. One surprise though and an outstanding one at that, was not listed on the menu but my Strip came with fries. I am not sure how they cooked them but these fries were really good I have to say.   Service is courteous, efficient and informed. For only being in operation a month or two now, I see no real bugs in the orchestration of the complexity that is high end service.   The hosts station was very efficient and we were seated within minutes of our reservations. I really like that efficiency and management skill in a top restaurant because that is part of what you are paying for and you get it here. There is paid Valet parking out on the Liberty St. side and complimentary, validated  parking in the underground garage.   There is a great looking bar area/section where folks are drinking, mingling and eating. I have not tried that side but it certainly looks inviting and beautiful.  As I said at the start, alright Pittsburgh, we have another great new restaurant in our great city. Thanks Eddie Merlot for coming our way.",

I ordered the medallion trio and ohmylanta the bacon Gorgonzola was ridiculously good with the oscar style being excellent as well. Portions were rather large for the price in my opinion. Asparagus was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend was happy with his meal choices as well, especially the bacon wrapped shrimp for an appetizer. Did not get any dessert as I was already stuffed but they looked yummy as they walked by. Our server was wonderful and very accommodating.

    "text": "I dined at Eddie Merlot's for my birthday dinner last night and was happy with the meal and service, but I was not blown away for the price we paid.   Our waiter was friendly, went over the menu with us, and brought our drinks promptly. He did, however, bring me the wrong wine, but happily switched it out for the right one.   We ordered the tomato & mozzarella salad, the wedge salad and the chopped salad. None of them were seasoned well. The tomato and mozz salad also looked like I made it in my kitchen in 10 seconds. The wedge was apparently worth it, though. So far, not impressed too much, especially considering how amazing Ruth's Chris and Capital Grill salads are.  As for the steaks, mine was good but not great. I got the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare (it was actually more on the rare side), but I ate it all. It was a high quality cut of beef, just not seasoned well at all. I'm actually not sure if it had salt on it because I ended up salting it myself. It was also pretty cold by the time it got to the table.   My husband enjoyed the Wagyu Tomahawk steak. He said the flavor was incredible and got it at the recommended medium temperature to help melt the fat. This cut is very tender, but the menu boasts it is 28 oz. It is mostly bone and didn't have much meat at all. He said it wasn't quite worth the price for the amount of meat he got. He is going to stick to regular ribeyes from now on.  The desserts were excellent. The table shared the s'mores, which was a giant s'mores tart and the Peanut Butter cup, which was like a peanut butter cheesecake. I also received a free Red Velvet Cupcake because it was my birthday. I let my family share that due to food allergies and they all loved it.  At the end of the night, the bill was over $550 for four of us. It definitely wasn't worth this price, but I still enjoyed myself because of the atmosphere and decent enough food. I likely won't be back, though.  Food Allergy Update: Eddie Merlot's will take care of any and all food allergies. Since the food is fresh and made to order, they can accommodate quite a bit. I did not get sick and give this place an A+ for attentiveness in that regard.",

We had requested a booth and we got a wonderful and roomy curved booth with a wonderful view of flowering bushes outside.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, rich wood, beautiful lighting.  We were greeted right away and ordered beverages and advised that they would be delivered by our server.  And we were off to check out the buffet.  They had an omelet station and lots of breakfast items including muffins and pastries.  BJ started off with mac & cheese, meatloaf and fried chicken.  I went straight to the salads, Eddie's chopped salad as very good, the Waldorf salad was amazing.  So were the peel and eat shrimp.  They were a good size and the cocktail sauce had an extra kick.    For meats, they served hand craved ham and chateaubriand.  I loved both, BJ thought that the ham was a bit dry.  I thought that the cream horseradish needed more kick.  The chef did bring BJ some straight horseradish was the kitchen.    I can't say enough about the dessert bar which was set up in the bar area.  They had a lot a of tiny little choices.  The best was the pecan and chocolate bars and the tiny carrot cake cupcakes with cream cheese icing.  All in all, a good experience.  The only negative was our server.  She didn't know how to refill water glasses.  I drank both mine and BJ's before I got a refill.  BJ had to wait forever for an offer of another beer.  And she rarely took away our empty plates.  You know, it's not a tough shift, being a server for a buffet.  But it was for her.  Not the quality of service you would expect from an expensive steak house.",

On the other, my main entree was a subpar cut filet that was both bland and bad in texture.  The staff is great here, and they seated us promptly.  Even with our large sized group, the staff was able to keep up with drinks and keeping the table clear.  They took our orders quickly, and there were no issues once the food (entrees and apps) came out.  Like I said, it was just the quality of my filet that left me wondering if I was really at Merlot's or if I was at Ponderosa Steakhouse.  Would I go back?  Sure!  I'd give them another try.",

    "text": "I have been to Eddie Merlot's twice for lunch, with differing experiences.  The first time I went was shortly after they opened this location, with an older male colleague, and the service was fantastic.  I had a burger, which was fine but nothing special.    Yesterday I visited with several female colleagues (and I myself am female).  The service was subpar, particularly in light of the price point.  My glass sat empty for quite awhile, even through we were in a highly visible area and the waiter walked past us frequently.  We did not receive bread, though tables of male businessmen received bread (that looked fabulous).  Our food took quite a long time to come out.  Eventually someone who appeared to be a manager came over and said that one of the dishes had had to be recooked because it was overdone (my thought: does that mean that my dish was sitting under the heat lamp all that time?).  While I am not one the one who picked up the bill, I don't believe anything was done to compensate for the extended lunch.  Bread wasn't even offered (the manager left so swiftly I didn't have a chance to ask for it).  I had the meatloaf.  It was good, but didn't knock my socks off. It was served with mashed potatoes, which were bland and lacked any wow factor. I lovea  good mashed potato, and they're not hard to make, so this is not impressive.  The green beans with the dish were well done.  The meatloaf left a strong aftertaste that lasted until bedtime that evening, so I would not recommend it on a date!  Overall, I am not sure what to think.  I hate to think that we were treated differently as a table of all women, but when I experienced much better service when with a male colleague and the tables around us did not experience similar service issues.  This leaves me reluctant to suggest Eddie Merlot's in the future, though I will go if someone else picks it.",

    "text": "Had a wonderful experience - beautiful location, superb staff interaction, everyone is treated like a celebrity - By Far one of the Best Steaks I have ate! The best Calamari, The best Mac Lobster Cheese! I'm the common person who likes to eat out every now and then with his wife so we have tried other locations in the same 4 Star rating and by Far the Best food in the  category - their Calamari was perfectly cooked tender, no grease, light! It was better than all the Restaurants who signature is Seafood! The price was a bit more and we did take a little leftovers home but pound for pound it was worth it! The combinations of excellent dishes! Why only a 4 .... Cause I had a lobster tail that I allowed to sit and probably my fault tastes a bit drier than what I expected but OUR MEAL pound for pound was the best! We'll find ways to shave the bill but we'll be back.",

And do try the peanut butter pie it was out of this world!  Ordered coffee that was full of grinds!  She left the bill but asked if we were ready before I even had a chance to look it over!

    "text": "Eddie Merlot is a new restaurant downtown near the Gateway station. I work in that building and was lucky to be a guest at their grand opening. My review is for that grand opening and not a typical sit down dinner.  Eddie Merlot put out a wonderful spread of food ranging from seafood, cheeses, desserts, breads, and meats including beef and pork. I'm a big seafood fan, so I decided to stick mainly to the seafood options. The shrimp cocktail was HUGE and fresh and the cocktail sauce had a nice quick to it. The calamari was tender and perfectly fried (not drenched in oil). The ahi tuna wontons were equally delicious. The lobster bisque was creamy and rich and had small chunks of lobster meat.  I definitely left feeling like I would come back for lunch and/or dinner.  The only downside of the experience is that I'm not a fan of the decor. I personally find it to be too busy. But it's a new brand restaurant, large, open and clean.",

The ONLY thing good was the lobster bisque which they give you PLENTY of.  The service was horrible, so bad that I'm going to write an actual letter to headquarters to give them my displeasure on what was supposed to be a great Friday evening dinner.  I had jumbo stuffed shrimp, which the crab meat was overcooked and too many bread crumbs which masks the actual flavor of the stuffed shrimp. Also had the \"special\" which was red snapper oscar style with shrimp.  The shrimp were bagged freezer shrimp, want to know how I know? Because someone said \"oh, these are the shrimp that goes in your salad, I get these from the freezer section at the grocery store\" . A restaurant that's supposed to have quality food as such was very disappointing.  My waiter, Armindo was horrible.  I had to ask 2 people to get his attention and then when I got it he didn't pay attention to my actual needs, which was me asking for the check because I wanted to leave FAST! The food was so bad that I didn't even eat all of the 4 shrimp that was given to me. Go at your own risk.  Setting : blah.  Noise : Moderate.  Food : Did you read my paragraph of displeasure?  Cost : $117  Come Back : Not even if the food was free.",

Temperature was hot when it should be - Lobster bisque steaming hot, flavorful with correct expected consistency. Did not appear to be \"held over\". Each and every menu selection we made did not disappoint. The cauliflower au gratin was savory and full of cheese. The meat was cooked to precisely our requested doneness.  And the attentive graciousness of GM Larry Stakes' interaction with us and his interest in honest feedback was genuine!   We say - JOB WELL DONE LARRY & your wait and bar staff at raising the bar, paying attention to feedback and details! Keep up the good work in a continuance in both fine food and service at your location! A complete pleasure to write this 5 star update!!!",

We got seated promptly, though we had a reservation for 3 and the table was only set for 2. The restaurant was nearly empty. Beautiful space.  Food: I ordered the 12oz New York Strip, which was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out a little more like a medium well - I didn't find it that disappointing, but I was a little surprised, at the price. My companions ordered a bison steak, cooked medium (seemed more of a medium rare) and the stroganoff, which she commented came out basically cold. We also ordered garlic potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus for the table. The asparagus was almost too tough to eat. The other dishes were good. We were celebrating my birthday, so a waiter brought me a creme brulee with a candle - no complaints there!  Service: \"Strange\" is the only word I can use to describe it.   By the end of our experience, 5 people had waited on us in some regard. One of them was very nice but spent probably 10 full minutes making conversation with our table. (Other waitstaff were squeezing behind him because he would not move? And he instructed our primary waiter to refill a drink we hadn't requested be refilled?) When our food came out, there were 3 people there to get everything served. (All I could think was \"please, just put the food on the table at let us serve ourselves!) One of them dripped gravy on my uncle's shirt and didn't seem to think anything of it - just gave a mellow \"whoops, did I get you? Just trying to turn this plate the right way.\"   Other restaurant employees were trying to set up some tables behind us and one kept falling...one waiter brought us a specials menu and commented something like, \"I haven't actually read it, ha-ha, but I encourage you to take a look.\"   It was just kind of a weird atmosphere and I sensed everyone at the table felt a little uncomfortable with each new development.   Long story short, there are far better and less-expensive places in Pittsburgh for a memorable, high-quality dinner experience. I don't recommend Eddie Merlot's if you want your party to be comfortable and confident they'll receive a stellar meal at a fair price. I get the impression they're trying really hard to live up to their prices. They shouldn't have to.",

Most of the group's dishes were very tasty, but I noticed that the portion sizes were very small. It's s good thing we had bread beforehand (which was good, by the way), or else I probably would have left hungry.  The server was very polite and we liked him. We also had an excellent bartender who was very knowledgable and paid attention to detail. Overall, a nice meal and a good experience, however the dinner took 2-3 hours which, in my opinion, took way too long! By the time we were done eating, it was bedtime because the food took forever to come out!",

We made reservations for 9pm and were seated within 10 minutes. The restaurant was beautiful from top to bottom (literally!). The staff were great from the hosts to the woman at the coat check and our waiters. We were seated by the window which was a great view. I ordered a glass of white wine, resiling, and J ordered a coke. We had delicious bread to start! I ordered the beet salad as my appetizer which was delicious. J ordered the Merlot Iceberg without tomatoes. He ate all of it which was great because he never really finishes salads. For our main meals, I ordered the sea bass with balsamic glaze, maple vinaigrette, and veggies. J had the crab legs. For our sides we ordered broccoli, macaroni and cheese, and hash browns. The portions are hhhhuuuugggeee!! We took 3/4 of our food home because it was no joke. The food was delicious though. We couldn't leave without having dessert. Since it was my birthday, I received a complimentary creme brulee which was delicious!! J and I also shared the vanilla cognac brownie which was...decadent and luxurious. When watched it being prepared at our table and it was food porn at its finest. Our total bill was around $160 which was great since the overall experience was amazing. Definitely recommend hitting this place up for a nice night out.",

(2 of 5)  The Long: We came to the steakhouse after the baseball game around 10pm, and were told that the kitchen was still opened. We ordered the crab cakes, two steaks cooked medium rare and a few beers.   The crab cakes came out within 20 minutes, which was decent timing but we were waiting for the steaks for over an hour. What made it worse was the continual barrage from our host that the steaks \"would be coming momentarily\".   We ordered a second round of beers and saw them sitting on the counter for around ten minutes before someone bothered to bring them over. We were considering grabbing them ourselves.  The steaks were okay. Nothing special. To sweeten the deal our server told us that the sauces would be on the house, but when the bill came they had charged us for it. They took it off but the whole experience was rather poor.  My advice? Try another place to get your steak fix.",
