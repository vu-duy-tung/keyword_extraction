Their bloody mary bar is an adult candy store where you can accessorize your mug of belvedere's with pickled turnips, ochra, cornichons, and at least a dozen different hot sauces.  Besides the drinks, the food is all phenomenal. Best eggs benedict. Pastami to die for. Be back soon!",

    "text": "Most of the restaurants in Pittsburgh offer the regular fare, so I went thinking that this could be an exception. Yes, the ambiance is cool, good place to people watch but the price you pay for the experience is too much.  I went in with 5 of my co workers. The waiter Abby, felt like she was doing us a favor serving us. The first thing any good waiter would do is to try and give an overview of the restaurant (kind of food etc) and tell us about the specials. None of that happened. In fact I had to point out and ask her if there were any specials. She simply told us that the specials were on the board behind us and expected us to read through! Such was the snootiness. I put up with it, as I didn't want to cause a scene. She took the orders and it was 35 minutes before the food showed up!! Never bothered to explain why it took so much time and never kept us updated.  Pretty bad experience. Compared to certain classy restaurants like Six Penn and Habitat in Pittsburgh, this place is more pretense and less class. Food was ok, but if  you don't feel welcome, what good is the best food? Go there if you want to drop a wad of cash and ruin your evening",

They have several house infused vodkas to choose from. Off the top of my head I can recall- garlic pepper,  bacon, and dill.  They were all great!   For $5 they bring you a pint glass with the vodka of your choice, and then you make your way to the bar to create the bloody mary of your dreams.  All kinds of awesome garnishes, spices, and hot sauces to choose from.    Ahhh take me back.    :)",

No seriously, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned into a consistency that had the expected sloppy Joe sloppiness but still inspired the high end eats of this gastro-pub.  Their fries, as always, are absolute heaven.  And the service (this time we sat at the bar) was friendly, speedy, and knowledgeable.  Without a doubt an excellent experience on the service and actual food end.  Pricing was extremely good for what we ate and their welcoming atmosphere and diverse dishes make it so you want to return and try something different next time around!",

    "text": "Every time a special event crops up, the answer to the question \"where should we go to celebrate?\" is always Meat and Potatoes.   Sometimes I'll try to mitigate the compulsion to eat here and try somewhere new, but more often than not we'll end up tucked away in an intimate table at our old standby.   Everything about Meat and Potatoes, from the obsessive attention to detail where cooking to order is concerned to the fantastic presentation of the food helps it maintain it's place on the top of our list.   The decor - a smallish place with intimate tables organized around a beautiful central bar in a very pre -prohibition era look - is reflected in their libations selections. And these bar tenders can actually mix drinks! Amazing!    The only possible downside is that, due to the open floor plan and the positioning of the bar, the place can seem a bit crowded and boisterous. If this does not jive with your idea of romance, choose a non-romantic reason to come.   There are only two \"bad\" seats in the house. A two top directly to the right of the entrance and a table along the curve of the wall that's really hard to get in and out of.   What really, really makes this place for me is the service. The wait staff is always subtly there but not in your face. They're knowledgeable without being snotty and very attentive.   The menu features a range of delicious options and preparations like the sweatbread tacos make some more intimidating choices accessible to those who might not otherwise try them.    All things aside, the absolute best thing about this place is that I have never been dissatisfied with either food or experience. In all the years that they've been open, there has not been one time where I thought the quality was slipping and that is really something else.   Hope this was helpful!!!",

As for appetizers we ordered several dishes, while they're fun in concept, I find these to be less impressive.

It was really refreshing to see what is essentially a steak place offer really thoughtful and tasty light and vegetarian fare.   I would have given them 5 stars except for the fact that they have outdoor seating and kept leaving the door open to the outdoor area and flies came into the restaurant and became a bit of a problem. Put up a curtain screen or something if the doors are to be left open.",

    "text": "My beau and I dined here two nights ago (yes, New Year's!) with an OpenTable reservation and coupons for two libations in tow. While I should've heeded the OpenTable warnings of limited menus and whatnot (being vegetarian and all), we head forth into the treacherous territory of carnivores.  I had heard great things from friends (...aka Yelp) and felt that I had to check it out. The sole vegetarian option was limited to brussel sprout salad, which seemed fairly unsexy compared to the other items on the menu. Jaren L. (my dining partner) ordered this, while I ventured away from my beloved legumes and ordered the carbonara pasta with pancetta. (I'm used to making concessions around my family and when traveling to foreign countries.) While I certainly would've preferred visiting on a day where they offered a more expansive menu, my dish was *quite* rich and tasty.  The highlight was definitely the cocktails we ordered. I had the Old Canadian - a concoction of bourbon, meringue, and maple, with a splash of vanilla and citrus. Absolutely divine! I wound up trading with my boyfriend midway through, who had gotten the Ronaldo (HOUSEMADE raspberry vodka, grenadine, and citrus), simply because both of our drinks were just so good.  I will definitely be back on another day to try their \"normal\" menu. Service was decent, but what really sold me was their aesthetic. I'm such a sucker for good marketing, design, and ambiance - all coupled with tasty drinks and food!",

We made a reservation, and when you do that, they ask if you're going to an event and what time it starts--so they can have you out on time.  We started off with two cocktails (I got an Old Canadian and he got a black pepper manhattan.)  I was looking around at the online menu before we left for dinner, and much to my disappointment the Old Canadian was no longer on the menu at the restaurant.  However, the waitress checked and had the bartender make one for me anyway! Woohoo! It was delicious maple-y whiskey goodness. :)  We also shared poutine (hey, I'm an Old Canadian, remember??) and i was great.  Not at ALL like the fast food nacho cheese fries I remember having in Quebec as a little kid...but in a good way.  Nice, crispy fries with mushroomy gravy and real cheese.  Bonus!  Husband got a burger (more mushrooms) and I got fish tacos, which were spicy, cilantro-y, and amazing.  Even though he is a total carnivore, he said he'd order them next time.  We loved the hip, dark atmosphere--it honestly reminded us a little of home (Omaha).  We will definitely walk down here after dinner in the summer a few times just to get a drink at the bar, and it will probably become a regular date night spot for us as well.  I don't know why we waited so long to try it!!",

The bartender blended us fantastic concoctions from their menu.  I've seen reviews for the poor service at this establishment and I believe that the time it takes to make these cocktails is part of that problem. Many of these drinks are rather lengthy in execution and if there is a restaurant full of patrons and only two bartenders, drink delivery could be an issue.  We were sat and our server, KC, came by and immediately got our attention. She was attentive and personable and spot on.  My main course consisted of the Fried Chicken and Jalapeno Waffle. The chicken was passable but the waffle was incredible. Everyone at the table was pleased with their meal and we promised a return visit in the not-too-distant future.  Good job, Meat & Potatoes in downtown Pittsburgh. Well done!",

    "text": "I have been here twice and my first experience was the best! Typically, you should make a reservation before coming here because it gets filled up pretty quickly. I love coming to this restaurant because they provide a good dining experience. The service is great and the ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful as well. It has a hipster, rustic, and natural feel to it. The low lighting adds to it as well.   I was excited to order the bone marrow because we have never had it before. I have always been hesitant to try it but I am glad I ordered it from Meat & Potatoes. These huge pieces of bone marrow come out piping hot and it is served with grilled bread. It is paired with 3 toppings which consists of picked onions, capers, and sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the bread and place your desired toppings on it and voila, a creamy and divine appetizer is ready! The initial bite will make your taste buds happy, happy, happy! It is so creamy and buttery! The pickled onions provide a nice crunch and tangy flavor to the buttery taste of the bone marrow. I highly recommend ordering this if you are up to being adventurous!   We also ordered the Short Rib Papperdelle, flatbread pizza, and Truffle Mac and Cheese. My favorite thing was by far the Short Rib Papperdelle. The creamy tomato sauce is perfect and the short rib was melt in your mouth. The papperdelle soaks up all of the sauce and tastes incredible! You could probably pass on the flatbread pizza because it wasn't that fantastic. I think they serve the truffle mac and cheese once in awhile because we did not see it on our second visit there. The truffle mac and cheese was phenomenal! It was cheesy and the flavor was heightened by the incredibly taste of truffles!   There are also plenty of cocktails that you can select from on their menu. The bar is gorgeous and you could also dine there as well. I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the downtown area of Pittsburgh!",

My recommendation here is sitting at their amazing bar with a friend, getting their Steak for Two (a huge 45 oz bone-in tomahawk)  and their Barrel Aged Manhattan (with a couple extra amarena cherries).  The food menu is always rotating with some interesting specials, but their mainstays (mac & cheeses, pasta, bone marrow, risotto, etc.) are phenomenal and I feel like I've tried almost all of them at this point.   This is the type of place where you come to the bar for just a drink and end up ordering all kinds of food because of how good it is.",

So I thought maybe I'd misinterpreted the moniker and it was supposed to be a rather basic menu type of place.  No.  It's fancy-schmancy menu names, fancy-schmancy prices, and an unimpressive delivery at the table.  The salmon skin was soft, not crispy, so somebody hoses up the temp of the pan before cooking those.  $14 for a burger w/ an egg on it?  It was just ground beef!  The small amount of lamb in the ravioli and brisket in the mac & cheese was like a table-side treasure hunt for small trinkets like you're at the dentist's office, and the bill... for the love of God!  The pot roast seemed to be a decent presentation, amount, and taste, but that was one out of 8 dishes we ordered.  The flat iron steak was also reported to be decent, so 2/5 stars over all.",

I only say interesting because they have so many delicacies on the menu that you don't find at most restaurants. I had a few firsts here and it was very memorable. With so many reviews on Yelp and their 4 star rating, I could not wait to try it.   Not having a reservation I was expected to be turned away at this popular restaurant but was pleasantly surprised when the hostess was able to get us seated in less than 10 mins in the alternate dining room.   From the moment I was handed the legal sized file folder that contained the two page menu, I was like a kid in a candy store. They had fresh mussels of the day prepared in 3 special ways. I ordered the bone marrow appetizer as it was highly recommended (my first time). It was delicious and very large as a starter.  For my main course I ordered the Steak Diane with the baked potato. The steak was huge and was cooked perfectly with a very delicious savory sauce. I normally do not eat baked potatoes but this one was to die for!   The drink menu was also very nice. Every drink I tried was very delicious. They have my favorite dark rum (Cruzan Black Strap) and it was a perfect compliment in the \"dark and stormy\". I also tried for my first time absinthe. They had a good selection. I definitely saw the green fairy after that drink!  Overall it was a great experience and I will be back as soon as possible!",

After reading all the great reviews I had high hopes for this place but I was not impressed at all.  First off I love the decor and the atmosphere. They really did a great job with that.  Also the service we had was great. Our waitress was the best. I would say she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had at a restaurant. I give her 5 stars.  But unfortunately the food was just not that great. They have a great idea but just something was missing and not quite all there with each dish. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad I just don't think it's worth going back for a second time. There's so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh I don't think I'll waste my time eating @ Meat & Potatoes again. I do have to give props to them for the dessert. We ordered the s'mores dessert which came out in a small cast iron dish that was warm, it was awesome! If you do decide to eat here definitely order the s'mores desert.",

If you must order their Poutine, ask for ketchup!  Fired Pickles were ok - the dip was especially good.  The fried batter wasn't special, but it wasn't bad.  Devils on Horseback were original and quite good!  Mac and cheese - ehh.  Again, salty, but the hint of spiciness was nice.  Caesar - I liked the ingredients, but the dressing was not subtle, just salty and ok.  It has potential to be a very good Caesar, but the dressing fails it.  At both the BatRye and M&P, throw out the salt shaker in the kitchen!  It is no excuse to flavor food with extra salt.",

The short ribs flat bread at Meat & Potatoes. They embrace their shortness.  The Short Ribs Flat Bread has blue cheese / cheddar / arugula / horseradish.  That's all you need to know to understand this is delicious and those ribs don't need to be any taller!  Very cool decor, interesting menu, pretty good beer selection (I had an IPA from 21st Amendment brewery) but the reason this is five stars is the service. I sat at the bar and the three guys behind there were awesome.  Made great recommendations, made sure I had everything I needed and provided by far the best service I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  They get bonus points because one guy noticed I was wearing an Archer t-shirt and asked if I knew the Bloody Mary prayer**, which of course I did.  He said a lot of the bartenders have been reciting that.  Nice.  I don't know how I got Skee-Lo and Archer references in the same review, but hey, it's Pittsburgh.  Anything can happen!

And the bacon maple syrup? Mmmmm!  Our waitress (I think her name was Sarah) was great and helped put together an order of chicken of waffles even though they were sold out and couldn't provide the usual combo of 2 pieces dark meat and 2 pieces white meat. It's a very generous portion of chicken.  I also LOVED the Bloody Mary bar. It really is a mini buffet. It was my first ever DIY Bloody Mary. I tried the red hot chili pepper infused vodka and added some spices, sauces and pickled things and it was great. I was worried never having had many bloody Mary's in the past would lead me to mix a bad one, but it was delicious!

Everything was so exquisite it almost defies description. The brussel sprouts arrived in an odd paper cup, but had the flavor a top-notch presentation. The grilled bread was delicious as always and our entrees could not have been any better. Jonathan enjoyed his duck immensely and my pot roast is the best I've ever had, and fed me for two days. We were both in the mood for dessert but the very small dessert menu didn't offer anything we were interested in on that particular evening, but that's okay. I still think the menu items are a little too heavy on the salt but, in general, it seems as though the food has actually improved as MP's time in Theater Square has gone on. I'm ready to return again ASAP!",

Pickles came out right from the fryer, runner did a good job of warning us which was much appreciate. Both were good but the pickles were definitely the tables favorite. My wife ordered the pork chop and I had the wagyu flat iron, both were good but I felt both lacked some seasoning specifically salt. Another member of the party had the pasta with the pork shoulder, probably the best dish at the table. Overall would possibly go back but for the most part the food tasted average to me for above average prices.",

So glad we did.   Every time we come here, we start off with some appetizers. Their fried taters are small. Cut French fries that come with their house made aioli- which is incredible. Their fried pickles are literally the best in all of the burgh- they come with spicy ranch dressing, again, housemade, and are to die for. I switch up the entrees each time I go- they have different specials each week. Their Waldorf salad is delicious. I've had the three little pigs sandwich which is incredibly large and worth the money.  The drinks are amazing. They have tons of unique beers on tap and last time I went I asked the bar tender for a fruity drink- he made me a drink with an egg white in it! Sounds odd but it was awesome.. Where else can you get that? Their deserts are incredible- they have a desert chef who makes the deserts as fresh as they come. Their chocolate mouse is incredible.  Meat and potatoes is a must. It's my favorite restaurant and they do everything perfect. Brunch, lunch and dinner- each menu is amazing. I'm obsessed.",

Devils on horseback- delicious, sweet and savory bites of heaven...bone marrow-I think about this plate and my mouth waters! With the perfect little complementing additions to enhance the rich fatty beef flavor, it is like there isn't enough. I swear this would be my choice of a \"last meal\". Steak for two is what we ate both times because it was so impressive from other yelp reviews as well as in person the first round...you can't go wrong! A great date spot and atmosphere to get a little fancy but- warning that you sit VERY close to other people so not an intimate atmosphere but a great pregame place to get a full belly and do a little downtown exploring.",

They do great mixed drinks but the beer and wine list is subpar, so opt for a cocktail. 2. The food is delicious, some of the flavor combinations are unconventional twists on familiar comfort food - go with your instincts on whether it sounds fun or not tasty. 3. They are almost always crowded...make a reservation.  The service is great if you have a reservation but I suspect much disappointment if you don't. 4.

    "text": "Brunch. Meat and Potatoes has officially raised the bar on what a brunch should be. This place FAR exceeded my expectations and then some. From the outside, the place looks a bit gimmicky, but trust me, once they've had their way with you, you will not regret coming.   We sat down in the busy place around 11am on a Saturday and only had to wait 15min for a table for 2. We asked the waitress if they had a bloody mary bar and she said something to the effect of- yeah, I'll bring you the alcohol you choose and then you can garnish your drink at the \"bloody mary bar\". THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSOLD ANY MORE! What actually happens is they have 6 or so house made vodka or tequila infusions which are phenomenal! Old Bay vokda? sign me up! Garlic black pepper vodka? you can count me in! You take you glass and fill it to your satisfaction with delicious bloody mary mix, which contains just the right amount of kick, by the way. After this, you are greeted a bountiful assortment of spices, garnishes, vegetables, meats and anything else you can think of putting in your bloody. Everything from smoked weenies, to perfectly cooked shrimp to sinful bacon. Artichoke hearts, several varieties of olives, celery and pickles await as well. They give you the alcohol and bloody mix and the ice, YOU take your destiny from there. Oh, and did I mention you get this entire experience for only 7 dollars?!  We saw after making these heavenly concoctions that we were going to have full bellies so we ordered only one main breakfast dish between the two of us. Chicken and jalapeno cheddar waffles, the menu read. What it actually should say is \"Deliciously moist cheddar waffles with satisfying kick of jalapeno with a WHOLE CHICKEN on top served with too-good-to-be-True bourbon bacon maple syrup.\" I was speechless when the dish arrived as past experiences at other brunching locations served me with a mediocre waffle with two measly strips of chicken on top. This was no ordinary chicken and waffles and I now don't think I can ever order this dish at another restaurant and feel satisfied knowing what's really out here.   Our experience at Meat and Potatoes showed me what brunch can and should be. I salute you, M&P for giving me what I think may actually be the best brunch experience of my life.",

While there seemed to be a few open tables, we were told it was an hour + wait if we didn't have reservations, but fortunately there were three open spots at the bar (went with two colleagues).  Food wise (both selection and quality) I'd say it was very good, worth visiting.  Service on the other hand was slow.  It took awhile for the bartender to take our order, and it was a bad sign when he returned to ask us for it again (and still didn't get it right...but to his credit, they comped the dish that he forgot and brought out late).    Some of the dishes...  -The Mac & Cheese with Chorizon and Pulled Pork was good (though I think Butcher and the Rye does it much better) -The Mushroom Risotto was also tasty.  As a side note, either of these \"small plates\" is a meal by itself -The fried brussel sprouts were amazing...a MUST! -The \"fried tater tots\" are french fries.  And a VERY generous portion.  We were expecting tater tots, so just want to make sure I mention it's really fries...and again, A LOT of fries -One colleague ordered a barbecue porkchop, which was bigger than him.  But he said it was good (though hard to finish after sharing the brussel sprouts and fries) -My other colleague ordered a caesar salad, which looked very unique...it had a fried egg, calamari and I think pork belly  Overall, good, will likely be back (though would give Butcher and the Rye the edge after a first visit to each)",

We got downtown around 3:30pm and had a drink a bar close by until about 4:45pm, we walked over to M&P and waited at the door until they let us in! We got the corner of the bar, which was perfect for the 4 of us. Cecil was our bartender, which I was happy about, we had him before and he knows his stuff! Not to mention, just a great personalty-makes the experience that much more awesome! :)  My boyfriend and I shared the dry aged strip tartar--amazing. served with a  smoked soft boiled egg, capers, chili, peanuts, and grilled bread. Be sure to open the egg up so the yolk oozes all over the dish, spread a little bit of everything on the bread and there you go..a bite of heaven.  As my meal, I got the Hudson Valley Duck Breast, which I knew I was getting long before we got there. It's soo fantastic! I like mine medium rare (how I would get my steak) and yes, it eats like a filet. This time it was served a little different from the last time I had it, which was a nice surprise! (it wouldn't have been a surprise if I read the menu lol) It was served with sauerkraut pierogies, chimichurri, and warped in pastrami-my mouth is watering as I type this..also thinking of my next trip back!  The drinks they offer are fun and nothing you'll find anywhere else.  A must try! But plan ahead! Enjoy!! :)",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have come to the conclusion that this is by far our favorite restaurant.   We made out reservation about a month in advance.  That was the only way we would ever get a 7 pm table for 2 on a Saturday night.  We got there a little bit early, so we had a drink at the bar.  The cocktail menu is adventurous and yummy.  You can always ask a bartender to surprise you, just give them some favorites of yours.    Once we sat down, we were presented with the menu and an explanation.  We settled on the pulled pork mac and cheese and the mussels.  The mac and cheese was to die for.  The mussels were also great; we chose a tomato based sauce, not our normal white wine sauce.  We decided to switch from cocktails to wine for the main course. The wine selection was expansive and the waiter was very knowledgeable.  I had the salmon, which was cooked just to my specifications.  I like my fish undercooked, which some restaurants don't seem to like.  He had the hanger steak which was also cooked to perfection.  The sides to both of our entrees were exciting, rare and complemented the meals well.    I forget what we had exactly for dessert, but I think it was some cookie dough type pudding.  We shared this as we were incredibly full, and it was scrumptious.   The only complaint I have is the the 2 person tables are a bit close together.  The couch that wraps around the wall (one of the seating for each 2 top), seems as if the springs have gone.  You sit down and sort of sink another 4 inches.    Overall, we are looking forward to our next visit, as this restaurant is amazing!",

The menu had one burger and about 6 fish sandwiches...which the hostess neglected to inform me of when we placed the reservation. As we are not catholic and had chosen this restaurant for their beef menu options we just ended up leaving. Since we literally only made the trip to pittsburgh for this restaurant we are now out the waste of time and money.",

    "text": "We were in Pittsburgh for a special occasion and decided to try Meat and Potatoes. We had a reservation and we were seated right away. I loved the atmosphere. It was pleasantly full but not crowded. No tvs at the bar which made for a lovely ambience. Our reservation was for later in the evening so the restaurant seemed to clear out with the theatre crowd. Our waiter was great, attentive without being overbearing, knew the wine list backwards and forwards and was lovely. We got the fried chicken livers and Cobb salad and then the steak for two with a chocolate dessert. All of it tasted delicious - well seasoned and generous portions on the sides. The only very minor drawback is the two top tables are very close to each other and it feels a bit like you are dining with the couple next to you. I would definitely recommend to friends who visit Pittsburgh.",

Enjoyed sitting at the bar, had good service, but because the menu is so meat-heavy (naturally, not a complaint), I had decided not to go there again.   However, I had recently looked at the Brunch menu, and thought it looked really inviting. Friends from Boston were visiting, so I took them this past Sunday. The atmosphere is definitely sexy and lovely at night, but during the day, it was disappointingly loud and garish. We were sitting under some kind of woofer and the beat was so insistent and loud, we had to shout to be heard. We asked the server if the volume could be adjusted, but it was clear, from his response, and the fact that the music was coming from a DJ, that no one was going to do anything to lessen the noise. Most of the tables were filled with older people and you could tell we weren't the only ones wanting to escape the loud thumping.  Come on, it's Sunday morning in Pittsburgh, not Friday night in South Beach. The food was mostly delicious but the atmosphere was so bad, we all agreed we would never do brunch there again.",

During the first three visits, the hostess was kind enough to sit me at a table since I prefer not to sit at the bar. This fourth time was different; when I said I wanted a table for one, the young female hostess said she didn't have wait service for tables. She said I'd have to sit at the bar.  While sitting at the bar, the hostesses sat at least 4 parties of 2 or more at tables. This discrimination against singles is intolerable! This is my last visit.",

I suggest you order some of their toasted bread (not free) to go along. Overall a great place and really good food. So why not 5 stars?...  1. Grilled bread was super burnt on edgeds- attention to detail is important  2. Brisket prices where all fat and no meat which was a disappointment.   Besides this my bartender Will was amazing!",

Many of my friends have been quite often and we had a discussion about why we think the food is OK.  The food here has many nice flavors but is greasier than appears and really salty. Because they season the meat with many other flavors and spices, you don't actually notice how salty the food is until you go through a couple glasses of water. Also, they used to give large portions and it was really worth the money but after I went back i noticed they were smaller. Service is fantastic and great atmosphere.

My husband is Paleo so places like Italian or Mexican are always out. The offerings here seemed to match with our interests. We had the Caesar salad with pig cracklins, the special of the day meatloaf and the lemon angel food cake. These were all perfectly fine items. I am here to sing the praises of the steak tartare on the starters menu. We live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so we have a ton of high end restaurants to pick from. The steak tartare at Meat & Potatoes is the BEST I have ever eaten, and my husband the Paleo eater agreed. It was simply spectacularly executed, beautifully plated and delicious. Next time we're in Pittsburgh we'll be sure to be back!!",

I'd recommend driving or taking an Uber.   The food was amazing. We ordered the bone marrow to start. It was perfectly prepared and severed with the perfect amount of accompaniments. As entrees I ordered the salmon and my dining partner ordered the flat iron. Both were delicious! The service was a little slow, we often had empty cups and plates. However we were sitting outside and were able to enjoy the weather, so it wasn't too big of an issue. I'd definite try to come here again next time we are in town.",

We ordered the wagyu flat iron steak, which also comes with potatoes and guac. Their sauce is very unique and everything just pairs so well with each other. We also got the mussels, which I highly recommend. Their house special that day was the curry lemongrass. The mussels were cooked perfectly and the sauce was so good. You should order the mussels with bread (extra $1) to dip it in the sauce since there is a lot left over. Their mashed potatoes was also good, paired well with the steak.   The only thing that could have been better is if they brought out the mashed potatoes with the steak together. I think they forgot about it and brought it towards the end (when we were already half way done with the steak). However, the service was great and they apologized for the wait. Overall, my bf and I had an amazing experience here and would definitely come back if we visit Pittsburgh again!",

The first time was during Restaurant Week a few years ago. It was just me, and I sat at the bar.  I left thinking it was one of the best places in Pittsburgh. Fast forward a couple years to my fourth visit... and I don't know if I'll be back any time soon.  I think the tables are close enough now that it's hard to tell where your personal ends and that of the person at the adjoining table begins. (When the young lady at the table next to me spilled her water, it would have soaked my pants.  Thankfully, the tables were so close that I set my napkin on her table as easily as if I were grabbing my own fork, and was able to stop the flow of water onto both of us.) The service also seems to be getting slower.  The noise level is so high, I feel you have to yell at the person across from you. And I'm not going to continue, other than to say it feels like a nice restaurant that's getting sloppy with the details.",

    "text": "So on this visit to Pittsburgh, I had two places on my \"eat at\" list - Cure + Meat and Potatoes. I ended up making reservations at Cure for Sunday Dinner and was lucky enough to arrive 20 mins after Meat and Potatoes opened for their Saturday night trade and since it was early enough, was fortunate and scored a lovely table on the patio.  I gotta say first up, my server was AWESOME!! I was a bit indecisive with the menu (there were so many good choices!) and he was really patient and listed options.  I ended up getting the chicken liver entree and the Crispy Pig ear sandwich which was on the daily specials list.   So thoughts on my liver - it was delicious and so so creamy, almost like pate... but...but for me, the accompanying sauce and breading was too aggressively seasoned. So let me explain - I wanted the liver to stand on it own, but because the breeding was so robust and spicy, I felt the lovely pate like taste and texture of the tender liver was lost. Similarly the accompanying sauce also had an assertive taste and when I dipped my liver into the chipotle remoulade, the delicacy of the liver was lost. I feel this dish could do with some more refinement- I almost wanted something more creamy as my accompanying sauce than the remoulade currently listed on the menu.  For my other dish, first I just want to list the ingredient list for my Crispy Pig Ear sandwich and #5 in particular had me most curious: 1) Grilled ramp BBQ  2) Apple slaw 3) Hazel nuts 4) Pecorino 5) Foie gras mayonnaise  6) Paprika Hot & Sour Fries 7) Ciabatta  So I grew to like this sandwich more as I progressively ate into it - my first bite wasn't all there and frankly the pig ear piece I got was a touch too crispy but as the apple slaw and the pecorino cheese mixed with the lusciousness of the foie gras mayonnaise, this sandwich really came into it's own. The accompanying string fries too were great and all together it was really quite good! Then the taste of the occasional hazelnut would pop up and it would turn very earthy.   So overall definitely an interesting meal and for sure I will come again to try some of the other menu items.  Yelp Review 49/2017",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and had a fantastic experience.   We made reservations, which I recommend, and were seated promptly. Service was impeccable. We did research about the menu before and knew exactly what we wanted and found the answers to all our own questions beforehand, but our waitress was very knowledgeable about the marrow appetizer we ordered and helped set our expectations in the right spot to help us enjoy it, which we did!  I sometimes wonder if places are worth the prices they charge, and Meat & Potatoes was, because everything tasted fresh and freshly cooked, the service was attentive and collaborative(several people stopped to fill our waters, take empty plates, or deliver food), and was a relaxed, warm atmosphere.   We will certainly recommend this restaurant to everyone looking for a place that's a little change of pace and gives you a chance to try new things.",

I ended up getting the Smoked Kielbasa Sandwich and Im so glad I did! The Kielbasa sausage was very hefty and flavorful. We got the Pancakes of the day to share. That day it was pancakes with pear compote, mascarpone cream, and candied hazelnuts. There were four pancakes stacked on top of each other, and each was very fluffy and thick. They served the pancakes with butter and syrup, but my friends and I didnt use any of it because the pancakes were already delicious without them. I was just in Pittsburgh for the weekend and definitely regret not trying their dinner menu..",

The food is really good. To start, I ordered the Brussel sprouts, which we covered in parm cheese and served with a delicious aioli. Honestly, the portion was so big this could have been my entre. But, I also ordered there roasted chicken(which honestly did not blow me away- still good) and the Bolognese dish(yummy!). The food was elevated comfort zone- strong flavors with simple execution. The service was perfectly fine- everything came out quickly and with a smile. I will absolutely return here and enjoy another fantastic meal. Come try it for yourself!",

I had a pork chop w collard greens and beans which was superb. We also had the \" beef stew\" which was fabulous and my children had the smoked chicken wings and lobster Mac and cheese which they enjoyed.  Order sparingly as the individual portions are enough for two people.  When in Pittsburgh make sure you go to meat and potatoes , they also own pork and beans nearby which is a BBQ themed restaurant.",

    "text": "The first time I was here with my boyfriend, I wasn't a fan. Maybe we ordered the wrong things...the wings were underwhelming...the duck portion was sooo small. And main the thing - the thing that always left a bad taste in my mouth - was that our card was double charged. I had to call the restaurant a minimum of 15 times to try to resolve the issue. I got the run around for over a month of them telling me first that they could see the double charge and that it was pending so would be corrected, then after it posted, I was constantly told no manager was in and I'd be called back or they'd look into it. It was very clear they were trying to brush me off. Finally after all that time, they said oh yes, we do see that, you'll have to dispute with your credit card company. I would normally have given up and just dealt with it because it was that annoying, but our bill was $130. I think it's a bit ridiculous to get the run around like that when you can clearly see someone isn't complaining about $20.   I just recently went back on a work trip, only because coworkers wanted to try it out based on the reputation. I will say that the service, the steak tartare, the bone marrow, my strip loin, my coworker's homemade pasta, and the experience were excellent. We all enjoyed our meals and had no complaints.   I'm glad I came back to try it out, and clearly my review indicates I'm not trying to hold a grudge, I just hope someone takes note of the customer service on my first visit and subsequent follow ups.",

    "text": "For those who have been to Pittsburgh, you surely have taken notice that this city's food game is on mf POINT. I lived in the city in 2015 when Meat & Potatoes first opened up. This restaurant was the highlight of every restaurant that I took my visitors. Everything there that I've eaten was always superb, Brussels sprouts fried to a fine crisp, perfectly succulent duck breast, but the grand daddy of all dishes is their famous Meat and Potatoes for Two. It's a 45oz ribeye on the bone, topped off with a mouth watering mushroom sauce, served with two halves of bone marrow, a hefty helping of potatoes with their famous pickled onions. Fucking YUM. So when I finally made my annual trip to Pittsburgh Mecca, I didn't need no damn beginners menu, we went straight to the table, no eye contact bc that only slows us down, slid right into the DM of that fine chair and put in our order. Water, still or sparkling? Nah maam, we're ready to order. Wild mushroom risotto, epic. And a 45oz gift from the cows. The only ribs eye want is this bad boy. We were served our risotto pretty quickly, mushrooms delicious and flavorful, as expected. But hold up wait a minute, this risotto is undercooked. We're crunching down on damn grains instead of the creamy rich soft rice it's supposed to be. Honestly tho, who cares. I got my ribeye coming, it might be raining, but ladies and gents, we still at Disneyland with a fast pass boutta get ourselves a turkey leg. The kitchen door opens and my head flips around, eyes locked. If y'all think the bride walking down the aisle is a beautiful sight, y'all ain't never been here before. But wait. What the fuck. The dish arrives... just bare meat. There's none of that mushroom sauce, no pickled onions, and hold up... no potatoes? The dish called Meat and POTATOES for Two, from the restaurant Meat and POTATOES seems to be... lacking potatoes? The bone marrow is charred to crisp, zero edible marrow on the bones, didn't even come with bread for it to go on, not that it matters because we would have just been eating plain bread. I'm not sure if there was a management change in the time I've been away, but if there has been, and if the previous owner somehow finds their way into this review, I implore you, fix yo shit. For $75, they've dropped everything on their most famous dish, and provided the bare minimum. This is like getting a $12 hotdog at the ballpark without the option to add any condiments, just a plain ol pink weenie. Pouring one out for my fallen homies. This is just plain disappointing.",

I ordered huevos rancheros which is one of my favorite brunch foods. The sauce wasn't as sweet as I like it, and there wasn't anything special or comforting about the dish, it was really just fine.   Cocktails are great, any time of day.",

    "text": "So two years later, I'm back at Meat & Potatoes for brunch on a beautiful sunny Fall Sunday. My friend and I felt lucky to have been able to make a reservation at 12:00pm on a Sunday with such short notice. Somehow -- they had a table for two available in the next 15 minutes! Sweet!   The best part? When we sat down. Such comfortable seat cushions. We were seated next to the DJ, which for some people would have been less than ideal, but we enjoyed the music and were still able to have a fine conversation without yelling, so I think the volume levels are set just right.  The menu features Eggs Benedict, shrimp & grits ettouffee, chicken and waffles and a few other things. Those who don't prefer eggs for brunch may feel limited in scope for choices (as my friend), but mostly everything on the menu is incredibly delicious (I say with confidence), so how can you go wrong?  I ordered the Thanksgiving Benedict, despite already harfing down 3 soft boiled eggs for breakfast earlier that day. I could eat 12 eggs a day. This was eggactly the eggsperience I was looking for (shoot me now please), but in all honesty: the Benedict was INCREDIBLE. Stuffing - delicous cuts of turkey and perfectly poached eggs with house made cranberry sauce. It came together divinely and was the ultimate comfort food. I tried my friend's shrimp etouffee as well and it creamy, tangy and delightful.  For dessert, we shared something only God could whip up in heaven. The problem being is that I was so damn engrossed with eating it, that I sort of forgot what it called on the menu (dessert menu changes practically daily). All I can say is: if there's a mix of ice cream + a brownie with nuts type of biscotti -- go for it! Or really trust your servers recommendations (like we did). So. Divine.  The price was super reasonable as well. Definitely recommend M&P for brunch -- don't know about dinner/lunch, but I would imagine they can do no wrong!",

    "text": "Beware, this review may not be butterflies and unicorns.  I gave this place two tries. The first time was a better experience then the second, but was not excellent. There is hot competition around meat and Potatoes right now, so if you are visiting the city you may want to compare the restaurants around this one. You walk into a lobby. The restaurant basically took over the lobby and made it where the hostess stand is and where you can sit and wait. The restaurant itself is very very tall, but there is not very many tables, so making a reservation may be a good idea. We visited on a Friday night around 90pm. It was not busy, there were plenty of open table. The person with me had never been. When we got to the restaurant we walked in first to see if it was busy before we put our name in. When we went back to the hostess to put our name in, my friend said that we wanted a table near the bar, but not in another room. The hostess snapped back at her and said, \"there is NOT another room. This is it!\" The attitude was very uncalled for, however my stare at the girl was not. I digress, and wait to be seated because we were starving and I still wanted my friend to try the food. We get seated after waiting only 3 minutes. The seats were comfortable. Very cushioned, like living room seating. The server came over to us with in a couple minutes, she was very attentive through out. Now to make my review shorter then it could be, I will recommend food items that I have tried, things I would not. This is what a non beef eater orders at a meat and potatoes restaurant! Don't judge!  The fried pickles, they are cut thick and you are given 5 or 6 pieces with a side of dipping sauce. Tasted good, but being an app, it was quite small. Served in a literary a small fair French fried basket. Wasn't sure if I was to laugh or be disappointed.  The poutine was good, however it was served a little cold. Being that gravy cools quickly, maybe having it served in a higher bowl to contain the heat better. Just a suggestion. The apps are very small portions as well, being you are intended on sharing them, having them a bit bigger would be fab. The buffalo chicken Mac n chz. This was very creamy, not so cheesy. I was overwhelmed by the buffalo sauce. The sauce, not the spice. My friend said it was spicy, but for someone that likes the spice kick, this was just too \"buffaloie\". Not very original in a good way. This was also a small portion. Not was served with it.  My overall opinion is that this place is given way too much credit. The food is eh (there are better around). The price is holy mackerel. The portions are no bigger the your hand (put your hand out. They are NOT any bigger then that, mostly smaller). Nothing is served with the meals (at least the non steak ones). The atmosphere is cute, the chairs comfortable, the \"server service\" great, the front staff- immature and need etiquette class. If the owners don't start listening to the \"little things\" that people are having issues with, I can almost guarantee this place will be closed within the next one to two years. The competition is on fire.",

Yes, is it a bar? Yes! Thats the best part, I would feel comfortable in jeans and a polo, just as much as I would in a full suit. No one here is discriminated from this dress code. The beer selection was great, but know whats even better is their drink selection. You know you've found a good place when you ask the bartender what you should get, and he asks what you're feeling. At that point you let him do his magic, and you sit back and relax. Is it a little pricier? Of course, but did I mention this is probably my favorite food I have ever had? Because it was, the best meal I have ever had. The fiance ordered the fried pickles, and the dipping sauce AND pickles were both incredible. I got conned into ordering their fried tatters (French fries, and he really had to force me to order them *not*) and I also ordered the mammoth pork thingy. I say thingy because calling it a pork chop does NOT do it justice. Think... Consistency of a steak, taste of heaven, with some BBQ flare in there as well. The collard greens were not something I enjoyed but thats because I am just not a fan of them. The pork was honestly just incredible. The french fries (I forgot to write about these earlier) were ALSO perfect. Truffle oil, and an incredible Garlic Aoli that I wanted to be buried in a vat of. With this being said, the service is ALSO incredible. Please go visit, and have the meal of a lifetime!",

It's hard not to hear your neighbors entire conversation.   We ordered the brisket Mac and cheese and mussels to start. The brisket was great the Mac and cheese not so much.  The mussels were really great! We got them in the Thai curry broth which was very tasty. We also shared the ribeye for 2. It's huge more like enough for 4.

    "text": "This is going to be a hard review to write. First of all, I very much love meat & potatoes. The food is amazing and atmosphere is awesome and this is definitely one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. But something happened while I was dining there with my husband in the summer that made me really disappointed about the restaurant.  My husband and I went to Meat & Potatoes on a Friday night and we ordered the Meat & Potatoes for Two and with the mushroom as a side (we paid $8 for this side if I remember correctly). It is a big dish so in the end we couldn't finish the steak and we had a large portion of mushroom left. When the waiter came and took our bill, I told him to box the remaining food that we couldn't finish. He came back with our bill and a paper bag. I trusted that he packed everything in so I didn't check the bag to see what was inside. The next day after we got home, I was very excited to eat the leftover but only to find that the waiter did not pack any of our remaining mushroom, which was a large portion left on the plate. I was very disappointed so I called the restaurant right away. Someone picked up the phone and was not very concerned at all and told me the manager would call me back about this issue. However, almost 2 months have passed and I have received no calls from Meat & Potatoes ever since.  I know people might think I'm being cheap here because it's only the mushroom! However, I did pay for that dinner (which was not cheap at all) and was told to be expecting a phone call from the manager. People are not to be fooled like this.  Sorry, I know the food is brilliant but I would not come back again.",

This place has been getting great reviews, which it made us even more curious to try it out and also raised our expectation. Last week, we made reservation a week before and got in at 5. The decoration was nice but different than I imagined. The stuff were friendly and nice.   Now the meals, Of course we have to order bone marrows. It is one of the reason we want to come, they serve something that others don't have. However! It was just like eating fat, on a toast. Hard no for this. Pig ears, deep fried, the sauce was very sour. Pickle was Good  tho. No to the pig ears. Pork chops- urgh.. no, stoped after two bites, I've had better. Salad-again, some thing you can do much better at home by yourself Burgh was good  Over all, everything was good but the food. I don't know why people loves this place so much, but it is not for me. I might give it another try if it is not so hard to get in. Since I have to book it a week ahead, i Would rather go somewhere I really like and enjoy. We almost had our rehearsal dinner here, but they don't have a room big enough can host the party. Now I'm glad we landed some where else.",

I know brunch is busy and reservations are a must however today there were at least 5 open tables inside and 5 outside. When trying to put our name in line we were told it was a 45 minute wait. 20 minutes later the same tables were still open! When checking back with the hostess she informed us the kitchen and staff are easily overloaded and they need to set people every 15 minutes. I have never seen that restaurant that empty and not able to keep up with the demand. Oh well. We walked down to Six Penn, got right in, and had a great brunch and some Bloody Mary's. No wait and the place was packed! Enjoyed a nice time on the rooftop deck.",

When we arrived they sat us right away, luckily, because the bar there was completely packed.  So the lighting is very dim with dark walls and floor to ceiling windows. Wonderful for a 10 o'clock dinner. We started with cocktails. The Boyd & Blair sours cocktail was frothy and smooth and it tasted like fall. My friend had the Slow Gin Fizz which was also delightful.  We ordered the mussels in a lemongrass sauce that was reminiscent of a thai curry and they were spicy but not too hot. Definitely try this out!  For entrees we ordered the Salmon, the Pot Roast, Fried Pickles and Waldorf Salad. I loved the salmon, but after trying the pot roast I will order it next time. My friend said \"this is the best pot roast I ever had... sorry mom...\" The fried pickles were crispy and seasoned well.  For dessert we had the buttermilk panna cotta and the vanilla bean pot de creme. They were both amazing but I would definitely recommend the panna cotta if you must choose.   Service was prompt, we were never waiting long for anything, not even our waiter. I can't wait to go back!",

I took my sales rep and sales engineer out for a team-building dinner to this place after seeing it on the Travel Channel.  It is a small place but we were seated at a nice table in the corner by the windows.  Our server was fairly attentive but not great.  My cocktails were good but not memorable.  To start, we had devils on horseback, poutine, and the kobe corndog.  My favorite was the corndog with the chipotle sauce - just divine meaty and spicy.  The fries in the poutine were crispy and soaked up the savory gravy well, with the curds squeaking properly against the teeth.  Devils on horseback needed some cheese or the bacon needs to be crispier because there was a slight texture issue while the flavour was robust.  The fried brussel sprouts were nicely charred and I snuck a pieces of chicharrone and crispy pig ear from the caesar salads.  The three of us also shared the 34 oz bone-in ribeye with mushrooms, steak fries, and bone marrow gratin.  I was a little disappointed that the ribeye was not medium-rare but more medium and the quality wasn't the best.  However, it was impressive looking and the steak fries were incredibly tasty, along with God's butter (aka bone marrow).  The dessert was a huge disappointment, as I ordered the salted caramel pretzel brownie.  It came out parfait-style but was so incredibly dry and the mouthfeel was similar to soft gravel.  I would not recommend ordering dessert here.  TL;DR - fun smallish gastropub requiring reservations that mostly has great food but service needs to perk up with more personality and dessert needs a major overhaul.",

Our daughter had the grilled cheese and tomato soup...huge and delish!!  I had the  mushroom bruschetta, humongous portion--I could barely eat one, but it was so yummy I couldn't stop!   Since we were sitting at the bar, we had the opportunity to interact and hear the bartenders talk about the spirits and food.  All three were absolutely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Atmosphere is hip and trendy, food and drinks are very reasonably priced-- we will be back for dinner!",

    "text": "Went here to celebrate my son receiving his 'white coat' at Pitt's pharmacy school. Nice decor and ambience. I think our waiter was new, but that won't impact my impression of this place. Loved the food. Easy to find. A little surprised they don't offer valet parking, but there is an indoor parking lot up the street. I had to try their iconic bone marrow I heard so much about(Travel Channel). It was delicious. Like meat butter, but very fatty if you're health conscious. I was disappointed to hear the 'Tomahawk' steak I'd seen on the Travel Channel was no longer on the menu. I had the Bronzino(head on) as my entree. I've had this dish many places and some places will filet it for you and remove the head. While the dish was filleted, the head remained on, which adds to the experience. Doesn't bother me. My son had the lamb cassoulet. Very tender and flavorful. I'll definitely get that when I come back.",

However, since I haven't actually been to Pittsburgh for about 7 years, the innocent act worked this time and the night was saved.  Our waitress was very good, and helpful!!  We made our way through the non-mammalian portion of the menu in that really beautiful, but laid back space.  The duck liver pate was oralgasmic.  The lemongrass moules- frites were delightful.  I had to restrain myself from picking up the bowl and slurping the broth!!    The soft-shell crab tacos were perfect.  Eating\"soft\" shell crabs that have been allowed to live too long is like getting a mouth full of fingernails.  These, however, were light, crispy and delicious.  I feel sort of bad eating them at their most sensitive point, though.  there they are, little crabs who are all vulnerable, maybe thinking of writing poetry again and BAM, someone throws them in the deep fryer.  Better luck next life, little crabs.  You were delicious.   The only disappointment of the night were the fancy cocktails.  They were OK.  The Aviation was too gingery and the hot date was weak tasting.  So stick to beer and wine and your will have an utterly fantastic dinner.",

To avoid ruining the hip vibe inside we were placed outside (we have a 2 year old and she's so. not. hip) where we waited and waited and waited some more for appetizers, some flatbread, and a ricotta that never saw the light of day. Clearly we ordered the most time-intensive meals on the menu. Although beverages came out as expected, we were quickly forgotten outside and left waiting until I made my way to the front desk and asked for a check. The server came out and actually asked if we were still enjoying our beverages after being told by the front desk we were upset (and beverages being beyond empty). Interesting. I asked for the manager and she comped the drinks and was quite pleasant considering the situation, but there's something about making my child wait for food that infuriates me. There is nowhere else in this city where I've experienced such lackluster service and poor ambience (when building a restaurant avoid placing your patio along the alley filled with garbage disposal units). Many thanks to our hotel staff for having Microwave Mac n cheese on hand to feed my daughter at 10:00 at night. We won't be back come hell or high water.",

They service it right out of the bone with various toppings to boot. The marrow tastes like putting a meat flavored butter on an already buttered toast. It almost tastes like pork belly but this one just melts on the bread. Next I moved to the wagu flat iron. The only reason for the 4 and not the 5 is the timing. I was not quite done enjoining the marrow and the meat was getting cold. Apart from that the steak was very tender and delicious. Warning that the carrot salad that comes with the steak is really tasty but spicy so be cautious. I would say it is on the medium side of spiciness but unexpected.",

I took my mother, mother in law and sister in law here for brunch this morning and I think I had one of the single best meals of my life.   We each ordered a bloody mary and thoroughly enjoyed the huge bloody mary bar with endless fixins and various infused vodkas. Absolutely delicious.  I ordered the french toast breakfast and it was sublime. The sourdough bread makes for a substantive yet fluffy toast. The warm bananas and bacon almond brittle added a sweet/savory contrast. I couldn't get enough. The chicken and waffles were ginormous. Half of one chicken fried and served over a cheddar and jalapeno waffle. You'll take some home. It's that huge. Sister said it was phenomenal. MIL ordered the quiche of the day. It looked like a slice of cheesecake. It was huge! The eggs were fluffy and the quiche itself was flavorful. Mom got the lobster omelet. It looked amazing and mom sure cleaned her plate! We had vanilla creme brulee and maple tiramisu for dessert. Both dishes were rich, creamy and delicious.  I will be going back for brunch very soon and very often. This is now my favorite restaurant in town!!",

    "text": "Was out doing the yearly visit to Pittsburgh and decided it was time to do some fine dining.  I came across Meat & Potatoes through Yelp, and secured a reservation.  Since there were only two of us, we decided to forego the main course and just stick with the mouthwatering appetizers.    In order of favorites (tartare and bone marrow may have been tied, to be honest):  *Tartare - perfectly boiled egg with solid protein, and runny yolk served on top of a heaping portion of steak tartare.  I don't know if it was the egg, the seaweed aioli, or the dry aged steak, but the flavors of this dish just worked!  Must have if we return! *Bone Marrow - not one, not two, but FOUR tyrannosaurus rex sized bones!  There was toasted bread and an assortment of toppers (sea salt, capers, etc) as well.  Needless to say, the two of us didn't finish all 4 bones. *Fried Pickles - thick, half-inch cut circles deep fried perfectly and with great side of spicy ranch.  We asked for an additional side of the truffle mayo ($1 charge) for dipping options.   *Poutine - probably our least favorite dish, and why this place can't get 5 stars in my book.  The flavors overall were good but the fries were overly salted, and the curds were almost non-existent, and the dish really didn't stand up in any way.  Overall, I'd definitely consider coming back to Meat & Potatoes next year!  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would definitely become a regular.",

This place was pushing distance from our hotel by the Convention Center, so we decided to check it out.  I called to make sure the kitchen was still open and got Mike at the front desk. He was hilarious on the phone and told us to come over. He was equally amusing when we got there. Bonus point - we hadn't mentioned that we had a wheelchair in our party. It's not usually a big deal, we just move a chair, whatever. We got there and Mike just said he had the best seat in the house for us and would be right back after the 'final preparations.' That was the politest way we've ever heard someone leave to move a chair without making a big deal out of it. A small thing, but it was one of many cute touches throughout our meal and a nice way to start.  Atmosphere is fun, the chalk drawing with the different edible parts of a cow was awesome. There's a fine line between trendy and pretentious and they totally made it.  Food - oh yes. We started with the fries with truffle mayo (string fries, delicious) and the lobster mac 'n cheese (mmm.) I got the mushroom flatbread which was perfect and Jeff got the tomahawk - a huge steak on the bone (shaped like a tomahawk) with chive butter and steak fries. All our food was incredible and we had plenty of leftovers.  The draught selection was on the small side, but they had a super random selection of cans and bottles. It's been a few years since I've lived out east so it was fun to try some new beer. They had an elaborate bar but we weren't able to take advantage of all that.  All in all, great. Host, waitress, food, drinks... I have no idea when I'll be in Pittsburgh again but I would definitely go out of my way if I was in town!",

It was packed when I walked in on a Wednesday evening, but found a place at the bar and Molly took great care of me from the beginning. Others pitched in as soon as I needed anything. I had a veal cheek special over kale with pickled vegetables, and fried okra . It was awesome. Great teamwork, outstanding service, fresh, interesting food, good beer specials and well chosen wine list. Highly recommend! Short walk from where i was staying at the Doubletree.",

Regretfully for this restaurant they must not have ever learned that first impressions are everything and these people at the front door are obnoxiously rude. Despite my better judgement I have eaten here three times despite this fact. Each time was about an average to below average experience. The food is good for the most part with exception to the poutine. It was very disappointing. They basically brought us french fries with cheese on top which is not poutine. The service is normally slow. One of our visits was on my birthday and the waiter spilled drinks all over myself and my wife. The manager did comp us a round of drinks, but in my opinion he should have comped us anything except the cheapest part of our bill. Unfortunately for this place they will be missing out on my business. Good food, bad service and not worth the wait. C-.",

    "text": "I really wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars. My wife and I travel an hour and a half a few times every year just to eat here. It is definitely geared towards food savvy customers. With food coming on half sheet trays, and kitchen towels for napkins it makes restaurant employees from anywhere feel right at home. The servers and bar staff all seem to enjoy their jobs and take pride in everything they bring to the table.      First was the alcohol- They have an excellent list of spirits including many prohibition cocktails, which in my experience have all been delicious. I'm a bourbon drinker, and anytime I find buffalo trace on a menu it's a sign of good things to come. Their barrel aged manhattan was sweet and smooth, and had exactly the right amount of bitters and an imported cherry to boot.      Getting appetizers is far and away my favorite part about coming here. The chicken livers are out of this world, and I always get an order of bone marrow. I've never had anything here that was anything short of fantastic, but if I were to make a recommendation for an entree I would totally suggest getting into what ever offal parts they have on the menu, or any form braised meat ( shank or short rib).     Always remember to save room for dessert. I am not normally a fan of dessert or sweet things in general, but I always save room for that last course here. On our most recent visit I tried tiramisu which was one of the best I've ever had, but the toffee cake was to die for. It was served warm with a side of house-made whipped cream and pomegranate seeds, and I would have ordered a second one had I not been full to the point of bursting. All around great place, with refined drinks, fantastic appetizers, delicious meals, amazing desserts, and the most comfy chairs you could ask for. 10/10 Joe Macklin PS. To all the jag-offs out there who are complaining about things like being told you cant have more people than you made your reservation for, please stop going to restaurants all you do is cause headaches, and no one wants your business. Also to those who hated everything they tried, it is not the fault of the restaurant if you have poor taste.",

First, I read the reviews before I wrote this.  Anyone giving this place less than a \"4\", probably doesn't understand what a gastropub is.  The wait sometime can be slow, but it is a PUB!  You're supposed to come to hang out and chat with friends and love ones while snacking on a amazing pub food and innovative drinks.  The must haves are the Devils on Horseback (chorizo stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon, topped with a mild chili sauce) or their pot pie, which has ground chicken skin baked into the crust.  All beers are served in tins, but if you know anything about good beers, some of the best craft brews have their beers in cans.  They also have 5 rotating taps.  Finally, for the desert lovers, they usually have two \"pots\", I had the basic pot de creme which was excellent.  I sat at the bar all three times and bartender's are the best.  I let one of them pick my entire meal my first time, and she put together a solid meal.  I hope I get back to Pittsburgh VERY soon.",

    "text": "Food was fantastic. The tartare was exceptional....if you are debating between it and the bone marrow for an appetizer, don't: it comes served on top of a bone filled with delicious marrow. One gripe, I purposefully seek \"gastropubs\" for the food typical of them, but also for a high-end beer selection which defines a gastropub as such. Meat and Potatoes fails on this front. Half of their beers are the type you find in big box grocers (Miller, Pabst, Tecate, Molson, etc,). The other half are domestic craft beers, none of which are particularly notable.  No belgian beers, no imports (unless you count the big corporate beers like Stella Artois and Boddingtons), and NO BEERS  ON DRAFT. This is sort of a requirement for a pub, much less a gastropub. However, if you are into the mixology, high-end cocktail scene, this place has you covered.",

I liked that they did not have a run of the mill menu. I ordered the duck (pastrami coated, served with saurkraut pierogies, dandelion greens, on the side.) They had no kids menu but my son ordered the Kobe corn dog with wasabi aioli and flat bread with short ribs, blue cheese, cheddar, arugula, and horseradish.  The food we ordered was tasty. The duck was cooked right and the flavor combinations were enjoyable. I recommend reservations. They were fully booked and we ended up ordering to go and ate at the hotel. The crowd was mostly young adults to middle age. No children (except for mine). The hostess and staff were friendly considering how busy they were when we came. The cost was a little bit on the high side but not outrageous. If I am ever back in Pittsburgh, I will definitely come back.",

    "text": "Meat and Potatoes (M&P) is the somewhat new gastropub from Nine on Nine Chef/Owner Richard Deshantz.  I have only been there twice but I have a strong feeling that it will be a fixture in the Cultural District for a long time.  It is a prohibition-era themed restaurant that is heavy on marble and velvet.  One fun aspect of M&P is their tableware: it is not uncommon for food to be served on cutting boards, or in mason jars with ceramic lids.    During our first trip over the summer, my girlfriend and I split the ahi tuna appetizer ($13); I got the Ribeye ($42) and she got the softshell crab tacos ($13).  The appetizer was raw chunks of tuna with wasabi infused tobiko on top.  It was served with some sort of rice chips on the side that were there to provide some texture to contrast the tuna.  It is an interesting take on a tuna appetizer and is still one of my favorite dishes.    Our dinner took a while to arrive but that is to be expected when ordering a 26 oz. steak.  My girlfriend enjoyed her softshell crab tacos and at only $13 it was quite a deal for 3 large tacos with an entire crab in each.  The crabs did not look like any softshell crab I have had in spider rolls or on sandwiches.  It was more high quality than what I am used to, but then again it should be considering the restaurant and price.    I was hesitant about the ribeye being $42 but with some goading from our excellent server I could not resist.  It is served on a wooden cutting board with a massive steak knife. It comes with confit steak fries, housemade steak sauce, and bone marrow butter served directly on the bone.  The fries were good and the steak sauce was fantastic.  I normally disagree with ruining the integrity of a steak by dipping it in a sauce, but this wasn't your typical A1.  The sauce, paired with the marrow butter, took an already great steak to another level.  They had four beers on draught during this trip but I enjoyed my dinner with a can of Wittkerke ($5) and a Belhaven Scottish Ale ($7).    On our last trip we went in for dessert and drinks.  We got the chocolate bread pudding and my girlfriend loved it but I wasn't too interested.  I became intrigued by cocktails that require egg whites, or meringue, and my attention could not stray from them.  My first one was the Old Canadian ($8), it consists of Old Grandad Bourbon, meringue, vanilla, maple, bitters, orange, and lemon.  It is served in a small rounded cocktail glass with a dehydrated orange slice that is supported by the thick meringue.  This was my first experience with meringue in a cocktail but it will surely not be my last.  The airiness and sweet texture of the meringue added an entirely new dimension to cocktails.  I normally find cocktails to be one note, either all alcohol and no mixer, or no alcohol and all mixer.  The meringue on top provided a sweetness that mellowed out the strong flavor of bourbon.  I also had the Tequila Fizz and although vastly different in styles of alcohol, it was similar in how effectively the flavors contrasted each other.    It is an expensive place, but it is worth every penny.  Keep M&P in mind for your next birthday or special occasion.  My only qualm is the clientele.  The location and food served doesn't allow for a typical, blue collar Pittsburgher to be comfortable.  I don't believe it is the restaurant's fault, as they are more than accommodating.  The Downtown suits just don't seem to like sitting beside someone wearing a flannel (me).  Ultimately, it is about the food and the food is superb.  That, paired with the service, make this one of my absolute favorite restaurants.     Oh yeah, you can add foie gras to anything...",

    "text": "Meat and potatoes simultaneously redefines and honors the historically blue collar experience that is Pittsburgh. This gastropub crafted impressive mixed drinks that satiate a palatte yearning for \"something different.\" The Pimm's Blue Ribbon shows off how versatile and tasty PBR can be when combined with the right liqour. Old Canadian and the Old Thyme Refresher also were both were expertly crafted, showing off the refined techniques of the mixologist behind the bar by utilizing freshly made mixers, simple syrups, and liqueurs rarely found in your common neighborhood bar. This particular night, we were served the bolognese and the salmon. The bolognese contained three types of meats (pork shoulder, short rib and pancetta) in a mind blowing concoction over a melt in your mouth gnocchi. While this is traditionally served over papardelle, the gnocchi was a home run with this sauce. The salmon was served in with a korean style kim chi laden slaw that was not your run of the mill, overwhelming kim chi flavor. Kudos to the chef for balancing this flavor with the delicate texture of the fish. The atmosphere was a bit loud, but not obtrussive (the chairs are super comfortable!!!!!). Service was not astounding but not obnoxious either. This is a must visit for foodies and non-foodies alike. There's something to satisfy everyone at a reasonable price (even the little boy at the next table over with his most excellent hot dog seemed pleased, and we all know that children are the harshest critics!). Support your local establishments and keep this place alive! It could be the next great tradition in a city filled with traditions.",

From the duck liver pate with sauterne jelly to the beef marrow appetizer everything was incredible.  Our group was a little high maintenance too because it kept growing as friends were showing up unexpectedly and yet our server was so patient with us.  We sat outside on their patio and it was a slightly chilly fall evening.  M&P actually offers blankets to patio guests in case they are cold!  Such a unique touch that sets them apart.  I had a lovely glass of barbera which paired beautifully with steak.  I will say the portions here are huge.  I know Americans tend to be big eaters so I am used to healthier, scaled down portions but if you have a hefty appetite then this is probably the place for you.  Wonderful wine list and amazing food.  For dessert I had panna cotta with a ginger blueberry sauce.  Heavenly.  I will definitely be back.",

Although you would think this would make a romantic setting you would be mostly right. The tables are crowded close together (if you like listening into other patrons conversations this is the perfect place for you) and are extremely small. Another problem with this seating configuration (includes a large bar in the center of the restraunt ) is the noise level makes it difficult to hear your dinner companions. We ate on a Saturday night and the place was extremely crowded and noisy. Service was below par-- I suspect due to the fact that our waiter had difficulty accessing our table due to the crowded conditions. We had shared the mussel appetizer and the meat and potato \"special\" ( 36 oz ribeye with steak fries). The quality of the food could be reasonably characterized as above average but no where near outstanding. Meat & Potato had a wide variety of beer, wine and alcohol selections. We did not patronize the bar but note that it was large and seemed like a fun place to hang out (no need to be concerned with noise at the bar).",

We ordered the fried pickles to start - they were delicious. Think slices and the breading was fantastic - I'm not even convinced they were fried b/c they were not at all greasy or soggy - yum!  We each ordered 2 specials - the Kobe Beef Hot Dog came topped with chili and mac-n-cheese with a side of fries. I had the Pulled Pork BBQ special - topped with pickled cabbage and a delicious potato salad on the side.  Overall - another fantastic meal at M&P.  It never disappoints!",

We started off with drinks and I enjoyed a Duke of Earl, which is an Earl grey infused tanqueray.  I am not much of a cocktail person but I enjoyed it, not too sweet nor too bitter.  We shared an appetizer of Devils on Horseback, which is a delicious fig stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon.  There were three, so we each had one and half and likely would have eaten more. We decided to share our entrees and ordered the scallops and a flatbread with pulled pork.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and served with quinua.  Loved it.  The flatbread was just 'meh'. Nothing exciting there. We enjoyed our visit to Meat and Potatoes and thought the staff were all friendly and attentive.  Our server, Crystal, was friendly and very informative.

With Penn Ave. Fish Co. right down the road, I would have rather saved myself some dough and gotten a far better spread.  The corn tortillas were bland, the mahi had no taste, and I ended up drinking an entire pitcher of water as the lack of garnishes left them dry as a 20 year old sponge.  I did have half of my wife's wild boar sloppy joe, which while significantly better than the tacos, didn't really impress.  I far more enjoyed the house pickles on the side of the plate.

    "text": "Rachel C and I feasted like champion eaters at Meat & Potatoes. We started with the mussels, which were a very generous portion. They were served in a peppery curry sauce and we received some bread for dipping. Then the kitchen sent out some fried pickles and brussels on the house - both were great!   Next up was the mac and cheese with chorizo and pulled pork (!!!). The cheese was definitely very Velveeta-esque (pretty sure it was Velveeta). Delish. I was so stuffed at this point that I really couldn't eat much of my main course. A shame because it was also awesome. Hanger steak with all kinds of veggies and potatoes.   Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. When she brought over my slightly-dirty martini, she immediately asked me to let her know if it was too dirty. It was, and I appreciated that she recognized that right away. My replacement martini was just right.   Next time I find myself in Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is definitely on the agenda!",

It took us a very long time to get a reservation trying multiple times we were in the city and for my honeymoon weekend and my birthday.  But, my husband and mother decided to just make a reservation and go there for no occasion.     I was slightly worried it was going to be pertinacious, but I was wrong.   The food is fantastic for a foodie and familiar enough for someone who is not. We got the mac and cheese and grilled bread to start.  The goat butter was so good I wanted to ask if I could take what was left home.   For the entrees I got hanger steak, my mother got fish and chips, and my husband got the duck.  Everyone was satisfied and full.  We didn't get any alcoholic drinks, but the soda came in some very neat glasses.    We got a reservation for my next birthday :-)... Would definitely recommend, but there isn't much seating so a reservation a couple weeks ahead is necessary.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to brunch a couple Saturday's ago with a couple of good friends from out of town. None of us had been here for brunch or dinner, we had just heard it was a do not miss.   We had been over served the night before :) and were looking for good bloody Mary's from this amazing bloody Mary bar that I had heard so much about. I am normally a vodka girl but after listening to our waiter go on and on about the sriracha honey infused tequila, I decided to go with his recommendation. When the glass arrived with ice and a hefty amount of tequila, he encouraged me to try it by itself before I head to the bar. What a mistake! Sipping straight tequila after a night out is NOT a good idea!! However, once I went to the bar and put their delicious house made tomato mix and about 800 fixings, it was the best bloody Mary I have ever had!! I fully recommend the tequila, just not straight.   I had reviewed the menu a few days before to get an idea of what they had and what I was interested in. I had seen an appetizer that was grilled bread, goat butter, and house made jams. I'm in. We ordered it first thing to share at the table. The goat butter was amazing, similar to goat cheese in tang, and the jam was apple cinnamon, to die for. The grilled bread was off the charts, however we did not order more for $1 due to the fact that I would have eaten it all and had no room for my actual meal.   I ordered the huevos rancheros, my boyfriend ordered the short rib hash, our friends ordered the chicken and waffles, and bruschetta. The huevos rancheros was very fresh and delicious. It had an excellent spice that was just at the border of too hot. (My favorite) The short rib hash was a small portion but very filling. He said that he was glad he ordered it, because it was delicious, but he would definitely order something different next time. My friend loved the bruschetta as it was mostly portabello mushrooms and bread. Yum. The chicken and waffles came with a jalapeno cheddar waffle that was not very spicy (which is what the waiter had told her)  at all and basically an entire fried chicken (that was amazing!). She at one piece of chicken and half the waffle and was full.   I would 100% recommend this to anyone looking for a brunch that is not the same old thing, reservations are a must as well. Our waiter was funny and just attentive enough to not be annoying. The atmosphere was comfortable and warm. We will be back!!! (Maybe for dinner this time.)",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Meat and Potatoes for date night. As other reviewers have noted, it can be quite noisy inside, and the tables (especially the 2-tops) are pretty close together, although not as close as I had feared.  Food and drink: We started with cocktails, which is unusual for us (we usually go straight to wine), but there are some very interesting options on the menu and we weren't disappointed. I had the Mexican Honey Bee- initially the smoky flavor is almost overwhelming, but then it settles and I really enjoyed it, a nice sipping cocktail. My hubs had the Root to Berry, which was also delicious. The hibiscus syrup gives it an interesting note. Hubs said it reminded him of a fruity beach drink, but it was definitely more refined and refreshing. We shared the bone marrow appetizer; the marrow on its own doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it has a silky texture and when smeared on bread and topped with the accompaniments, it was delicious. We both had the Wagyu flatiron, medium rare. Hubs liked it more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it was fine, but I was expecting more. The steak didn't seem to have much of any seasoning (salt or pepper) on it. We did enjoy the bit of heat from the jalapenos, and the celery root puree was yummy. We both had some underdone potatoes, which is too bad because the ones that were fully cooked were tasty. We chose the red wine special for the night, an Excelsior Cab, which was a nice, easy drinking wine. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the dessert- chocolate pot du creme. We each had one, and I am glad we ordered our own because I would not have shared. It was fantastic. As in if you were home, you'd lick the bowl to get every last bit. We ended the evening by enjoying another cocktail at the bar before heading home.   Service: No complaints at all. Riley was our server and he showed up at just the right times. The busboys were friendly and on their game, once we had both finished with our plates for the course they'd be there within a minute to clear. Allison was our bartender and she was great, I was impressed by how she moved so fast and was still able to converse with patrons. Those bartenders earn their money.  Price: Nothing we wouldn't expect. They appear to use high-quality ingredients and it shows. Although I saw a few small children, I wouldn't really recommend it for kids given the food, ambience, and price point.   We'd definitely go back. We agreed we'd like to go back without a reservation, sit at the bar, and order drinks while working our way through a few of the appetizers. Allison suggested checking for a night when there aren't any major theater shows, as it's a bit less busy then. We'll take that advice for sure.",

We took our friend to Meat and Potatoes for a birthday brunch and were less than impressed with the brunch. First, they do not have a milk frother and only offer coffee. That would be ok IF they had black tea (which they do not, or did not, the weekend we went, which is absurd to not have on hand--go to the CVS across the street and get some when you run out). So coffee or bust which seems awfully strange for a \"top\" brunch place in Pittsburgh. The lack of tea or a latte definitely ruined my brunch. The food was meh. I ordered a regular eggs/bacon/homefries and it came out cold. The others ordered the fried chicken friend pork and it was a \"big pile of blah\" (direct quote from the eater). The bloody mary bar was like something in a college bar. Not worth it. It was very expensive and very busy, so the service was poor as well. We kept having to flag down a waiter to get service. Should have gone to the neighbourhood greasy spoon.",

    "text": "I wish this place opened earlier during my time in Pittsburgh. Gastropubs should be the new thing, and it definitely is mine.   My friends and I (party of 4) went for a really late dinner Wednesday night. I made a reservation for 10pm, and we were seated at a well-located table with super comfortable chairs. The server was very personable and attentive throughout the entire meal, and eager to make suggestions.  We started with drinks, my friend and I ordered cocktails (Blood & Sand/Thompson Daiquiri), and my boyfriend ordered a draft that was served in a cute little mason jar. The cocktails were delicious and well-crafted, but very strong and tiny, not to mention a bit pricey. (although reasonable for restaurants like this)  Between the four of us, we ordered the Charcuterie (3.5/5), fried taters w/ truffle mayo (5/5), fried pickles (4/5), Arancini (5/5), Mac-n-Cheese (4/5), Pate (5/5), The Salty Pig flatbread (didn't try), Bolognese Gnocci (5/5), Pub Burger (4/5), and Tartare (4/5).   I would recommend getting the Pate, fried taters w/ truffle mayo, and the Bolognese Gnocci.   I am definitely going back to try some of their steaks and their brunch menu as well!",

    "text": "A friend and I went to Meat and Potatoes after work on Friday and we made reservations through Open Table for 6:00 PM - easy enough.  We provided our name and got a table right away.   We decided to order several smaller items rather than an entree.  So we got the cheese platter, poutine, short rib flatbread, and lobster mac & cheese.  First we'll deal with the cheese platter - not super impressed.  I prefer my cheeses to be flavorful and sharp...but at least have something to it.  There was only one cheese out of the 3 varieties provided that had something to it...and it was on the mild side.  So nothing too great with the cheese platter.    We ordered the poutine at my suggestion and encouragement b/c I've heard so much about this stuff that I felt like I had to try it.  Maybe I had unrealistic expectations of what fries, gravy, and cheese curds could really do for me, but I felt like they were ok.  I mean potato patch fries with gravy at kennywood would be an adequate comparison...just add some tasteless semi-melted cheese curds and voila you've got yourself some poutine.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I guess I was expecting something AMAZING.    Now on to the good stuff - the short rib flatbread was really really good.  Just the right amount of meat coupled with some flavorful cheese topped with arugula.  Definitely a standout among the dishes.  I highly recommend.  Finally the lobster mac and cheese - delish!  There were visible signs of lobster, not just specs of red - but actual pieces of lobster.  It was sooooo goood!  Another standout dish and maybe the star of the night.    So all in all I highly recommend the short rib flatbread and lobster mac & cheese - those 2 dishes alone will bring me back to Meat & Potatoes!  They are also what made me give this place 4 stars.",

My wife and I went here for our 9th Anniversary dinner.  We started with an order of Poutine to share as an appetizer.  Its hard to find bad Poutine in my opinion, so this was delicious.  I ordered the Prime Strip Loin with risotto and wild mushroom ragu, very good.  I order all my steaks medium and the waiter warned me that their \"medium\" is a bit more red then other places.  I said that it was fine and it was.  The steak was more red than I usually get, but was extremely tender and flavorful.  My wife got the Flat Iron Steak with corn, fried green beans and some chili and really enjoyed it.  We were too full for desert, but really enjoyed our meals. They were even nice enough to offer us two free glasses of sparkling wine to celebrate our Anniversary.  Hope to get back to try the Bone Marrow and hoping I can talk my wife into sharing the 45 oz. Rib eye for two someday, as pictures of it on Yelp and what I saw in person make my mouth water!",

Per usual the food was out of this world; however, the service was very lackluster. We made reservations weeks in advance and our table was not ready until 10 minutes after our time. It took some time for our server to get around to us before we could place our drink orders. Time passed, we ordered our appetizers, they came out and we nearly finished them before we got out first drinks about 30 min in. Our waters were not refilled for some time and when our food did come out there was no check in from our server. The food was great but service was tough. We ended up ordering our wine through another waitstaff just in order to get it before the end of our food.   What really surprised us about the menu is that for 40-70 per head restaurant is that they do NOT offer espresso?!?. We ordered coffee and had what tasted like that mornings drip coffee that was lukewarm. When leaving, we told the three hosts at the front door goodbye and it seemed like we could not be bothered with their time.",

    "text": "What an amazing dinner (HELLO 45oz Ribeye)!  I asked several friends who lived in Pittsburgh before to recommend some restaurants for dinner, and most if not all said to come here. Meat & Potatoes did not disappoint. I made a reservation a week in advance and was immediately seated when I walked in. The service was great throughout the night, and I know this is a bit random but I LOVED THE MUSIC here. They played 90's and early 2000's mix of music (pop, r&b, hip-hop) and I was in heaven. SHOUTOUT TO THE PERSON WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE MUSIC HERE. YOU ARE THE REAL MVP!  My party of 4 split the Uxmal Malbec (very easy to drink and went well with our food). For our appetizer, we split the Bone Marrow (5/5 freaking delicious and very large portion- might be a bit much to share between 2 people but with 3-4 people the portion was perfect), and the Fried Brussels (2.5/5 super salty especially the parts with parmesan on top, have had much better Brussels Sprouts elsewhere). Now onto the main highlight of our meal... Of course, we had to order the 45oz Ribeye special (comes with Bone Marrow Gratin). We ordered this with Black Truffle Butter and Potatoes Au Gratin (5/5 the potatoes were absolute perfection). The Ribeye was cooked perfectly (medium rare), and the Truffle Butter + Potatoes made for a fantastic meal. Personally, I didn't want to just eat meat so I ordered the Pappardelle (5/5 this was the first Pappardelle where the Bolognese sauce was very 'light' and not too heavy).   If you come starving and don't order an appetizer, 2 people might be able to finish the 45oz Ribeye (also depends on what sides you order of course), but based on the amount of food we ordered, we weren't able to finish our meal among 4 people (2 guys, 2 girls). If you don't want leftovers, I would suggest ordering just the 45oz Ribeye + a side to share between 2 people.",

I let my server Kelsey(I think that's her name) know and she immediately got another one made and the manager comped my meal. It was tender and juicy and perfect with the roasted potatoes and butternut squash. I also had the Mexican honey bee  cocktail which paired perfectly with my meal! The only complaint I had was the broccoli rabe had way too much spice and didn't pair well with the rest of the entree but their customer service kept their 5th star!!",

We have tried most of the menu over the years, and there's nothing I wouldn't recommend. Our go-to starter with every visit is the mushroom risotto. I'll admit that sometimes it's too salty, sometimes not enough, but on the nights it's just right there's nothing better (assuming you like mushrooms...and risotto...and salt in the form of parmesan as Samin Nosrat has taught us).   Last evening's experience was great. Food, A. Drinks, A. Waitress, A+. Notably, she asked if we were dining before a show (we were and suggest you do, too) so that the food could be brought out timely. After, she held our leftovers (the pork chop works for two) in the refrigerator so that we could pick them up at the end of our night.  When we first arrived for our reservations, on the other hand, none of the three hostesses greeted us nor acknowledged our presence while they yelled into the phone and talked amongst themselves. One of them finally turned her attention to us. She asked us to follow her - but left before my husband finished hanging his coat, leaving him wandering aimlessly through the dining room. Poor taste for a delicious dinner.  While this seating experience was not all that dramatic, M&P has earned high expectations from me - and they begin when I walk in the door.   4-stars: Go tomorrow ------ Ratings: 5: Go today 4: Go tomorrow 3: Go if you're in the neighborhood 2: Go if you're desperate 1: Go somewhere else",

I was deciding between the fried chicken liver and fried pig ears, I asked the bartender and he said oo yeah tough choice but I would go with the pig ears so I ordered that.  Yes the brussel sprouts were so good and it is a pretty big portion.  If you don't like brussel sprouts, this will change your mind.  I know the sound of fried pig ears sounds weird but it is just meat and just chewy and oh my was this good!  It had a sweet chili sauce with it and pickled vegetables inside.  I was so happy I ordered that and it was so different.  I would definitely recommend that dish.

While I did think that the fried chicken tasted great, I personally prefer more breading. Also, the juices from the fried chicken, which clearly just came out of the fryer, did spill over onto the waffles. This was a tad too much for me as I felt like I couldn't appreciate the flavor of the waffle. If I could do it again, I would take the fried chicken off the waffle and put it to the side.The brisket was delicious and quite heavy. It did have a heavy hand of salt. Overall, would recommend the spot for brunch! Make sure to call for a reservation.",

Seating is tight but wasn't full at the start of our dinner so we didn't feel cramped. At the end of dinner, we had people on both sides of us and felt cramped.  It was hard not to hear the conversations of the pairs on both sides of us.   Our food was just average to below average for us. We started with the devils on horseback and poutine. The devils had a good flavor profile but it was lukewarm at best. The poutine was hot but not very flavorful. My wife had the short rib. She was disappointed. The short rib was dry and lacked flavor. The polenta had no flavor. I tried her dinner and had to agree. I got the flat iron which was very good. Would have been great if it was hot but it too was lukewarm.  The flat iron was the highlight of our meal though. We were both happy with the drinks and the selection is great.   Our service was great. Our waitress was attentive and not intrusive. The other staff also worked well together to deliver food/drink and clear the tables.   Overall we were not impressed for the money spent for this type of meal. When we are back in the cultural district, we are going to try a new place.",

I ordered the huevos rancheros as my entree as this is my favorite breakfast dish. I expected just your average huevos rancheros but this was so much more. It was topped with pulled pork and picked onions which was excellent together.  The Bloody Mary bar is out of this world though. You can choose between multiple infused vodkas such as old bay, bacon, dill pickle, etc. They have a vast number of different toppings that will keep you wanting to make multiple trips.",

The pork chop is big enough for two, especially if you order an appetizer or two. We had the bone marrow and the devils on horseback which were both quite tasty. The cocktails are expensive but well made and enough kick to leave you calling a taxi if you have more than one. Our bartender was friendly and fun, which would explain the mass of humanity congregating around the bar. My only complaint about M&P is its popularity. It's difficult to get a reservation and you need to get to the bar at 5:00 or run the risk of getting shut out by 5:30.",

The music was definitely on point, as were the drinks! My partner and I decided to try the pig ears (delicious!) and fried brussels (not so delicious and a bit too greasy for my liking) for appetizers and then build our own meat & potatoes for two.   I know what 45 oz of liquid looks like, but 45 oz of ribeye? I was in heaven! The ribeye was cooked to perfection and the black truffle butter and chimichurri sauces were so delicious. We chose to do the au gratin potatoes and collard greens as our sides upon the recommendation of our server. I told her I am originally from the south and asked if she thought I would be happy with the greens to which she replied yes and that they were her favorite. I am sorry, but I was almost on the floor when I tasted those greens... they were sweet! I have never heard of sweet greens and I was definitely not feeling them at all. The au gratin potatoes were also a bit heavy and even though I love cheese, I would have to say these were almost too cheesy. Regardless, the ribeye and bone marrow made up for everything and we ended up just focusing on those.   Overall, I think Meat & Potatoes was pretty delicious and I would go back again, but probably not order the Meat & Potatoes for Two. Although the meat was delicious, I think other meat lovers could probably get a better fill of meat from a Brazilian steakhouse for around or less than the $75 that I paid for the Meat & Potatoes for Two.",

The steak was prepared just as I ordered, the potatoes were cooked perfect, crispy and hot. The steak....... was ok. Not bad, but nothing special in my opinion. Honestly the appetizers and service really made the meal for me. And my colleagues and guests seemed to really like their food. So I will definitely come back and try more items.",

All of Emily's suggestions were spot on! Their cocktails were really tasty without being too sweet. I had the Root and Berry. My husband and I shared the Mussels in a pancetta sauce that was really tasty. I had the salmon on Emily's recommendation. The general rule, of course, is not to order the fish at a meat restaurant but this is an exception. It was a complex mix of Asian flavors that was inspired. My husband had the flank steak and nearly licked the plate. My only negative is that I would have ordered the Pork Chop but it was 5\" thick and could probably feed a family of 4. If that's a negative, there it is. But our table neighbors loved it. Oh and the 45 oz Ribeye is a bit obnoxious IMO, but plenty of patrons were up to that challenge. Cue the \"I ate the old 96er\" t-shirt.",

I didn't order anything else unfortunately but I'm already excited for my next visit here. I've heard so many good things about this place. My boyfriend got their lamb meatball, he loves it except for he thinks it's too many mint leaves. We had such a great experience overall, except one little thing. The menu said the lamb meatball was $20 and they ended up charging us $22. They later on fixed it after we told them. Look carefully next time. I don't think this happens often, but it's strange! I know it's $2 but all the waiters and waitresses should know the price that's on the menu.",

I came in at pretty big group for a 10:00PM reservation on a Friday. You would think that such a late reservation would mean that we got in after the crowd had died down and service would be faster. It was about 45 minutes until we received our appetizers and we did not get our entrees until 11:45. Like I said, the food was absolutely amazing. But the wait was pretty problematic, especially given that some of us hadn't eaten since that afternoon.   I think I can give Meat and Potatoes one more try to see if perhaps this was just an unfortunate fluke. But if the wait time is like this again I don't think I can justify sitting around for an hour and a half, even if the food is excellent.",

I would probably choose to go somewhere else for a nice dinner, just based on my own preferences for fish and lighter fare, but we had a good experience overall. Service was friendly and attentive, but we were there for early dinner before it got hectic. The cocktails were tasty and strong, but I didn't see anything too unique. I would say that the drafts were a little disappointing as they only had two or three on tap that were not IPAs.  In more detail are the dishes we sampled:  **Special Shrimp and Shishito Pepper Appetizer** 3/5 This dish was okay, but the shrimp was very salty.   **Smoked Buffalo Wings** 4/5  Solid wings, with crispy exterior and moist, smoked flesh.   **Wagyu Flat Iron Steak** 4/5 The steak itself was phenomenal and cooked perfectly, but the accompanying potatoes and sauce were way too salty!  **Special Black Squid Ink Pasta** 3/5 Pasta was cooked a little too soft and the shrimp was over salted. The sauce was milder and less salty, which helped balance the dish, but overall was not too impressed.   **Pub Burger** 5/5  Get this! I heard only happy mumbles as my eating companions scarfed down this massive burger. I've heard great things about the burger and was not disappointed.   **Vanilla Panna Cotta** 4/5 I'm used to softer Panna cotta but I enjoyed this slightly firmer version with Apple butter and granola on top. It wasn't what I would expect on Panna cotta but it somehow worked.",

Poutin- French fries, it was cheesy and drenched in gravy, (just ok)  Bone Marrow- it came out with 3 large bones to scrape and eat with crispy bread. There wasn't much flavor to it as anticipated. It could've used some seasoning or even a dash of salt.   For the main dish we ordered the Ribeye for 2 (medium rare), with the sides of au gratin cheesy potatoes and cauliflower mixed with capers.  Overall it was just OK. Pricey place and it was good but not amazing like everyone made it out to be.  Also ordered 3 glasses of scotch and our total came out to be $250 before tip.",

My only thing is waitress sometimes took too long to come back to the table. There is a balance between hovering too much and not being able to be found.",

LOVE the pig ears. This is the only place I've had decent pig ears above the mason-dixon.   I ended up getting a pasta dish since I was craving some comfort food that night so I can't speak to their specialties. But the papardelle was fantastic and I would order it again if we return.   They had some really intriguing menu items that I look forward to trying next time like buttermilk fried chicken livers and bone marrow. Definitely a menu that appeals to a foodie but can also please anyone since they've got burgers, sandwiches and protein entrees like salmon and chicken.",

We didn't recognize all of the items that went with everything. The portions are huge, so come hungry! I ordered the pork chop and it was enough to feed 2 people.

Our waitress stopped by, got us drinks and went over the menu. She was very helpful - my wife was considering the lamb and she let her know that it was a very generous serving, so my wife opted to order something a bit smaller. We both went with the salmon - and it was fabulous.   Service really was top notch. Just as we finished, dessert was offered.  We shared a chocolate mousse style dish, which was wonderful.   Atmosphere was nice - the restaurant was perhaps a bit smaller than we had thought, but the noise was never overpowering.   Friends had reported mixed experiences here - ours was terrific.",

French toast is good, but a little pricey for what it is.   Service here is outstanding, especially during peak hours (which always impresses me).

Where do I begin to even comprehend to you the ATROCIOUS customer service this place has....not only were the people SARCASTIC but they have no idea what the proper etiquette is for greeting and welcoming people. YOU SAY HELLO NOT WAIT FOR US TO SAY HI CAN I HAVE A TABLE....OBVIOUSLY we were here to eat and not just stare at you while we WAIT for you to notice us...even though we WERE THE ONLY people in front of you. We had a friend waiting for us and he had stated that he was outside, well I informed the hostess since I didnt want to be rude and just walk in, that we were here to sit outside since a friend already had a table for us. Well, she pointed at the door and stated \" its that way\", then turned back to whatever she was doing....ok.....so we head out sit ourselves down.   With a name like Meat and Potatoes you would think MEAT and Potatoes would be the highlight...but nothing really AMAZING caught my eye in regards to that. I ordered steak BLUE along with some type of potato ( mashed) The plate LOOKED pretty but lacked flavor only salt. The apparent \"bed of brussel sprouts\" was just (I am guess 2 AT MOST). The waitress was no where to be seen, we even had to waive down another server for refills on drinks. Only other time she actually came was to give us the check....Note to servers, if you have people seated outside, check on them. When we wanted to pay, we waited an additional fifteen minutes until we GAVE UP and walked inside to pay....ONLY TO BE TOLD TO SIT DOWN AND OUR WAITRESS WAS GOING TO ASSIST US....Well GEE, if she showed up more than TWICE in our whole evening then maybe... JUST maybe we would have, but that was not the case.    I then went inside to buy some shirts and when I informed the woman at the front that I wanted to buy shirts she snickered at me and said,\" I have to go get the manager because I dont have the key for that\" Ok, no problem....got my shirts and left....  I have had bad service, but honestly this place gives Pittsburgh a bad reputation, this is not a restaurant you would want to visit if you are looking for quality food, great service and a memorable experience.  Go ANYWHERE but here.",

    "text": "We have been attempting to get a reservation at Meat and Potatoes for two years!  Full disclosure, our expectations were high!   We started with fried pickles, fried pig ears, buffalo chicken Mac and cheese, and smoked chicken wings.  The fried pickles were some of the best I've had- crunchy, briney pickle chips, crispy breading and delicious dipping sauce. The pig wars were tasty with Asian style cucumber salad and daikon radish- the serving was a little too large for my liking.  The smoked chicken wings were cooked perfectly crispy skin, juicy chicken and a great sauce with yummy blue cheese and celery.  The buffalo chicken Mac and cheese was definitely lacking in the buffalo sauce dept. I prefer a baked Mac and cheese with less creamy cheese.  The special salad of the night was 5 hour beet salad.  Tasty- but not the best I've ever had. My entree was disappointing. It was salmon with a Korean preparation- black rice, kimchi, cucumbers, and Chinese sausage. I never did figure out where the Chinese sausage was. The black rice, which beautiful, lacked flavor and the Kimchi had a very pasty spiced texture.  It was far from a favorite.  Lemon angel food cake was my desert of choice but the lemon was very disappointing and tasted quite artificial.   All in all, the service was excellent, the apps were yummy, but the entrees and desserts were a tinch disappointing.",

We only had drinks and dessert, so I can't comment on the entirety of the menu.  The drink selection was good and the bartenders were very knowledgable. I don't know if it's a new trend, but I noticed that several restaurants in Pittsburgh have Absinthe on the menu. I had the US Absinthe and it definitely had earthy tones, just as described by the bartender.  The atmosphere was great and it made me want to stay and drink yummy cocktails all night. We probably would have if we didn't have a 6:00 AM flight the next morning. The food selection on the menu look great and the dishes around us at the bar looked delish. If we ever go back to Pittsburgh we'll definitely be eating a full meal here.",

    "text": "It was great. Yep. That's the end of the review.   All right, I came out here for dinner and I was incredibly pleased at my decision, so much, in fact, that I skipped out on another place my second night and came here again, for reasons outlined later.   First night was mostly appetizers on my end. I made the mistake, if there ever was one, of ordering the famed bone marrow appetizer, which the waiter cautioned was more of a 'sharing' app. Whatever. It looked great in the pictures so I got it.. and yes. It was a delicious pile of bones with bone marrow to scoop out of with all of its super fatty greasy sweet goodness. Yes, it did start to get overwhelming at the end. Yes, it was a ton of food for a reasonable price. So my original intention was to order the pork chop (which in itself is enormous) but no, I had to stop with the steak tartare appetizer and close out with drinks.   Let's talk about drinks. I like fancy craft cocktails. I also like rare liquors that are hard to find in the States. Meat & Potatoes has both. Greta was my bartender for that evening and we started off conservatively with stuff on the menu but by oh, drink four, I was peeking through her bartender's black book for novelty's sake. She also alerted me to Fernet Branca Mentha, which is a super minty version of Fernet.   Second night was the pork chop that almost got away. Stuck to the basics, got it, and it was perfect. Beautiful presentation, just done right pork, and it was enormous amounts of food for reasonable prices (for a high end gastropub... bear in mind, I come from the DC area where stuff like this cost 2-10x more). Admittedly, it was less memorable and more basic than night one's debauchery of meat butter and raw meat. The fried brussel sprouts though. Get them. Those WERE incredibly memorable from the second night.   Get reservations. They're probably one of the most desired restaurants in town. Great service, great food, awesome experience.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went here after we saw a show downtown. I had heard great things about M&P and was super excited. However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience.  I got the lamb burger and my girlfriend got the duck.  The lamb burger was not good. I thought the meat was spongy and didn't taste fresh. I was pretty sad, since I was expecting to be blown away.  The duck, however, was delicious. It was very well cooked. The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was tender. The plate came in three parts on a long plate. A salad, pierogies, and the duck. The flavors from each were good on their own, but to me, they felt like three separate dishes. I didn't feel any unifying theme between them.  Perhaps it was my fault that I didn't get the steak. I think I will try again someday in the future.",

So when work offered me and few coworkers to pick up our dinner tab, I told my coworkers I knew exactly where to take them in the 'burgh! As a side note, this was all their first time in Pittsburgh by the way :)  We were impressed from the very beginning when they brought us the water. I loved that they left a bottle of water on our table. I drink alot of water and am always annoyed when the waitstaff doesn't refill it fast enough at other restaurants. We ordered wings and mac n  cheese to start as appetizers. Both were delicious! The entrees didnt disappoint either. We all ordered something different just so we can try a bite of different dishes. Last but not least, we also ordered a chocolate mousse. Every bite of that dessert was heaven. It went much too fast.  I want to come back again and try more different dishes!",

    "text": "After hearing and reading raving reviews about Meat & Potatoes, I dined there expecting the best of the best.. of the best in Pittsburgh. Even though it was very tasty, it did not meet the 5-star review that I was expecting. However, I had dinner there for a work function, so I was in the back room with a round table and was away from all of the activity. For me, this took a lot away from my entire experience because I couldn't experience the atmosphere in its entirety.   Let's start with the appetizers. I tried both the fried brussels and Artisinal Cheese Board. The Artisinal Cheese Board was definitely my favorite. The display was so cool, and it was definitely great for sharing. Someone in my party loved the Bone Marrow, which I wasn't feeling brave enough to try (maybe next time?). The Waldorf salad was pretty tasty. A little bit on the bland side, and I was expecting a better presentation, but overall, I would order the salad again.   For the main course, I ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron. I order my meat medium well, and it was a little pinker than I had hoped, but it was still pretty good. And, the serving was huge! I was definitely not expecting as big of a steak...enormous actually.  Dessert...delicious. It seemed like they had seasonal offerings, and I had the gingerbread cake, which was my favorite part of the meal. Again, huge piece of cake.  Oh, and cocktails...my party seemed to enjoy what they had. The bar was hopping.  I've tried to make reservations for this place a few times and it's been booked. Book in advance, and on a Friday or Saturday night, don't expect to walk in and get a table without a reservation, especially because this place is located right in the heart of the Theater District. It's also loud, so don't expect to come here and have a peaceful, quiet dinner...I prefer atmospheres like this one though.  Overall, I would recommend Meat & Potatoes, especially because of its location. It is not your traditional place by any means.  The menu is not ginormous, but it has your fair share of unique offerings. For what they offer, the prices are what you would expect and not outrageous either. For Pittsburgh, it is definitely a place that really stands out and has a more creative, chic take on things.",

Order the rib-eye FOR SURE (it comes with marrow so you can skip that at appetizer time, it's great, but use your \"room\" for the appy that delights you most.  Visit 2. Brunch: Bloody bar, check, bacon vodka suggested.  I got the hash (Meat and Potatoes right?!).  Wow, so good.  Visit 3: Casual Dinner: Burgers and Beers.  They've got a great selection of both.  Maybe start your meal with the \"snacks.\"  Friend brussel sprouts anyone, yeah, I think so!",

I came in with a friend with no reservation because there were no more available when I tried to make one online. The host took my name down and said she'd call me if there were any cancellations. So basically telling me I wasn't getting a table if no one cancelled. But she quoted another party of two that came in after me 20mins. Unacceptable. Not sure what her deal was. I asked to speak with a manager and told him the situation. He sat us right away. I wish I could remember our servers name because he went above and beyond to take care of us. I had the croque madame. I've had better but it was good. The French toast was to die for. I will fly back just for that French toast and I live in California. Overall I had an amazing experience.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Meat & Potatoes for a long time now and finally had the opportunity to go to brunch last weekend on Sunday.  My friend and I had reservations for 2 people at noon, and we were seated promptly.  I had no idea what to expect, but given the reviews and my ideas of the place comparing it to other upscale restaurants in the area, I was wholly unprepared for the extremely loud music that assaulted our ears as we entered the dining area - the place was fairly crowded with people, but even with that the music drowned out the voices of everyone and it was difficult for us to even hear one another.  My friend has a medical condition that is exacerbated by loud noises (which had I known about the music volume here I would never have suggested eating here), and while the manager did kindly lower the volume a bit even with that, it was still uncomfortably loud even for me and I don't have the health issue that my friend does.  I despise going out to eat only to have my eardrums beaten down with loud music that makes it nearly impossible to have a conversation with the people you are with but given the very intimate nature of the seating (you are practically on top of the people next to you) I guess that the restaurant opted for loud music versus involuntarily eavesdropping on the patrons next to you.  So, as far as ambiance goes I rate it a 2 because of the too close seating and the loud music plus the tables are so small that it's nearly impossible to fit even 2 plates with drinks on each 2-seat dining table.   Our server, whose name I don't remember was great - he was very attentive and accommodating.  I have zero complaints on the service.  The food was hit or miss, though the prices were comparable with local fine dining restaurants that serve Sunday brunch.  My friend wanted to try the fried taters so we decided to share those and this was by far my favorite part of our whole meal. The fries were well-seasoned and crispy on the outside while the center was still warm and soft - they were nearly the perfect french fries!  I'm not a big fan of aioli in general but their truffle mayo had a great flavor.  I had coffee, and it was decent coffee, but it wasn't great - there are much better cups of coffee at other restaurants around Pittsburgh but it was okay once I added cream and sugar.  I ordered the shrimp and grits as my entree and my friend ordered the roast beef eggs benedict with house hollandaise.  The shrimp and grits is covered in etouffee which I didn't really like as it overpowered the creaminess of the cheddar grits and detracted from the typical flavor of a traditional shrimp and grits.  It wasn't bad - I just didn't like the two flavor combinations together.  My friend said that the hollandaise sauce was lacking but at the same time she didn't mind because she said that it didn't taste like a traditional hollandaise sauce and that she wasn't happy with the flavor of it, but that she didn't mind the dish, but would have preferred no sauce or a traditional hollandaise instead.  The overall experience was a bit disappointing and underwhelming particularly given that I have heard so many good things about the place.  I would definitely go back if invited, but I won't make it a point to go here when there are so many other great restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

Cooked to perfection with fries on the side. Others in our group ordered the roast beef which looked amazing.

Biggest complaint would be the size of the room and the noise, made conversations across the table a bit difficult.",

This was a huge helping, with more meat than rigatoni! I didn't notice the pancetta in this dish, though listed in the ingredients.  It was fabulous, with a huge portion to take home (should reheat well, too). My lunch partner had the house smoked duck salad. It was a very small portion - the salad was the size of a side salad, with four smallish slices of duck on top. She felt that it was overdressed.  For the price, the size was disappointing. I will echo the other reviews that note that the seating is awkward and close together.  As the Washington Post dining critic, Tom Sietsema often notices, a proprietor should sit in every seat of the house to experience the customer's viewpoint before opening.  We were seated next to two large (tall, broad shouldered men) who had some difficulty and awkwardness in getting into their seats.  I had almost no leg room.  The 2 tops are just awkward. Service was fine, no problems. We were pretty low maintenance. My drink was refilled quickly and our seating and food service were prompt.  I look forward to dining here again, and my husband will be grateful for the leftovers tonight!",

    "text": "It was about 8 pm on a Sunday night. We just got off the Duquesne Incline and found street parking after we drove across the river to downtown. We originally planned to see the Rubber Duck installation after dark before grabbing dinner. Thanks to a quick last-minute change of mind, we called Meat and Potatoes and were lucky enough to score an 8:45 pm reservation.   It certainly took a lot of luck to get this table. Once inside, we saw that both the bar and the dining tables were fully-occupied. The lively patrons and the dark and sleek interiors reminded me of a recent dining experience at The Girl and the Goat in Chicago, where I had my best dining experience in 2012.   To my pleasant surprise, the quality of the food here was comparable to that from TGTG. The bread with goat milk butter and jam was so addictive that I couldn't put down my butter knife. The seared duck breast we had was just as good as any I had in Manhattan, only at a fraction of the price tag at $19. The pierogi with the duck dish was good but seemed out of place. I guess it was a way to keep the meat and potatoes theme. The only disappointment was the blue cheese flatbread, where despite its inventive combination of flavors, didn't impress either of us.   For a restaurant this good, we were surprised to hear the dessert selection was rather average. We were so lukewarm about the choices that we decided to skip them all together.   The modern interiors and nicely-prepared dishes were more than enough to give this place a 3-star rating. When our bill came out to be around $50 for the two of us, the fourth star is much deserved.",

    "text": "I love the bar here. The bartenders are all amazing, incredibly helpful, friendly, and knowledgable. They can make you amazing drinks, and can give some great recommendations too. It can be pricey for the cocktails, but they are worth it. The craft beer selection is cheap if you're into that, too.  The brunch is fab, and the $5 bloody mary bar, including house-infused shots, is one of my favourite things in the universe. Just saying.  This place can get hectic, and there can be quite a wait. The food is pricey, but portions are generally pretty generous. The snacks are great and cheap to compliment a night at the bar.  Lots of out-of-town businessmen and even celebrities regular here. It is generally a 30+ bar crowd.  You're not allowed to sit at a table and just order drinks. It doesn't matter that drinks are mostly $10+ and it doesn't matter that there are lots of open tables. I found that very rude and off-putting when I was refused a table on a Monday night because I didn't want to order food at 11pm.",

The restaurant while small is very nicely decorated and while the tables are close together that does not bother me.  We got the wedge salad and split it- it was very large and very tasty!  We also ordered the meat & potatoes for 2.  It was a Tomahawk ribeye.  While it was very tasty it had quite a bit of fat and didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting.  I saw quite a few other dishes going out that looked fantastic so i will be sure to try one of those the next time!",

And, if you sit at the bar during Saturday or Sunday brunch, Bloody Mary's are all you can drink for $15.  That, my friend, is a deal.  Now on to the food.  Wow.  Here I go with superlatives again, but the shortrib hash with poached eggs drizzled with horseradish hollandaise was, without a doubt, absolutely stellar!  Rich, melt-in-your-mouth, succulent shredded shortribs melded together with creamy potato cubes.  Perched atop were two perfectly poached eggs whose yolks, when pierced by a fork, enveloped the hash in creaminess only surpassed by the final crowning glory of a zippy housemade horseradish hollandise.  Superb....I've been fantasizing about them ever since.    The hubby enjoyed a plate of chicken and waffles.  You may recall he ordered the same thing at Alchemy & Ale recently...Meat & Potatoes makes chicken and waffles the way they SHOULD be made!  Crisp, crunchy, JUICY, ON THE BONE chicken pieces piled atop a crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside cheddar jalapeno waffle kissed with bacon bourbon maple syrup.  Ooooooo....maple. Bacon. Bourbon.    We each had a specialty drink - me the Bacon & Egg - a blend of bacon vodka, orange juice, sugar and egg white.  The bacon vodka was a house infusion that packed more bacon punch than the Bakon brand I have in my bar.  I am going to try my own bacon infusion again!  The drink was interesting, but next time I want all that bacon-y goodness in a Bloody Mary!    Fond memories of San Remo and Monte Carlo meals always ending with Fernet Branca enticed the hubster to order a Kingston which included Drambuie and Fernet Branca along with pineapple juice.  He enjoyed it, but enjoyed his Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat Ale even more!  He IS a pumkin ale fan.  The brunch prices here are amazingly reasonable!  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, professional and efficient.  The kitchen is top notch!  Meat & Potatoes is a PERFECT way to start a weekend morning!",

    "text": "(11/10/2014)  Heard a lot about Meat and Potatoes, was mentioned in Bon Appetit's article about Pittsburgh being the next big food city.  We arrived close to 10pm on a Monday night, place was bustling, very loud (DJ spinning tunes in the corner, luckily in my age group), full of the pretty people here to see and be seen.  A large bar hogs up most of the main room, a circular dining area rings it.  Place is dimly lit, beautiful dark wood and cast iron, marble and mirrors, like a 19th century parlor.    We were seated towards the end of the bar at an unfortunate turn in the dining room.  Overflow from the bar made passage pretty tight.  Dimwit hostess tried to seat another group between us, either she gave up trying to make me move into oncoming traffic or the incoming guests decided (wisely to ask for another table).  The place pretty much filled to the gills, then I realized, duh, Monday night late menu special \"Night Cap\" (starts at 10pm).   Cocktails, Prohibition-era, were the best of the night (this was stop #6 on a self-guided restaurant crawl of downtown Pittsburgh).  My friend had the 25th Hour (subbed vodka), I had the Southie; both made great use of herb and spice liqueurs for subtle accents.  Since I knew we were headed this way, saved myself for the Bone Marrow.  An enormous tray arrive with 2 large marrow bones split in half and stacked.  Accoutrements were classic and perfectly matched to cut the unctuousness of the marrow (pickled onion, parsley, sea salt, capers).  We devoured the top two, they were phenomenal.  The bottom two were unfortunately cold (as much of a carnivore as I am, cold marrow is totally gross).  Also had the Devils on Horseback, jumbo Medjool dates stuffed with chorizo, wrapped with bacon and broiled.  Very tasty, touch overwhelming on the dates for me (maybe use a smaller date?).  The menu is not, shall we say, \"lite\", but hey, you didn't expect that from a place called \"Meat and Potatoes\" did you.  I can see why the place has turned heads.",

    "text": "I made my reservation for Meat and Potatoes a couple months in advance and they were more than accommodating when I had called two additional times to make it larger. So, I was really happy with their customer service from the get go.   We arrived 15 minutes before our 10:30 pm reservation and were seated exactly on time. I was hoping that since was later in the evening that we'd get seated earlier, but the place was actually still very packed.   The hostess seated us at a table with very plush, tufted dining chairs and a beautiful wood table. (I immediately had dining room envy.) The menu gave you choices, but it wasn't overwhelming. However, there were so many different things that we wanted to try for starters, but we settled on the Mac and Cheese, Fried Taters, and the Smoked Buffalo Wings. My plan was to focus on the Smoked Buffalo wings and the fries, due to the breakup that my digestion system had with lactose a few years ago. For my main dish, I ordered the Waygu Flatiron Steak because, I mean, this place was probably named \"Meat and Potatoes\" for a reason.   And, I soon discovered what that reason was....   ::Cue Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 in C Major::   A culinary masterpiece sans fanfare and haute cuisine presentation descended upon us. The appetizers arrived in beautiful, steaming piles on cast iron dishes. Even though I was hungry,  I couldn't help but wonder how we'd even finish half of it.  That worry was quickly erased. I began shoveling french fries into my mouth. And, after I saw my sister break the crust on the steaming pile of corkscrew noodles drenched in creamy cheesiness, the plans to forgo the Mac and Cheese were quickly forgotten.   Everything was OUT OF CONTROL good. The wings were an amazing ratio of saucy to crispy. And, there was a perfect smokiness to the wing sauce. I would venture to say that they were the best that I have ever had. The mac and cheese was uniquely divine and set a new standard for the cheese pasta dish. The fries were perfect crisp and seasoned.  Potatoes were never done better justice.   When the waiters came back for our plates, there were only bones and emptiness left in this post apocalyptic foodie wasteland. We, the Annihilators, were full, happy, and ready to tackle the next course.   The Waygu Flatiron was perfectly marbled and seasoned, served with heirloom tomatoes, pickled jimaca, and wasabi mashed potatoes. The steak has become what I would want for my last meal on Earth. The mashed potatoes weren't my favorite. The consistency was a bit stiff and the wasabi was off putting when contrasted with the other flavors in the dish.   We were too gorged to even consider dessert, but we did get the pumpkin cheesecake to go. It is served a cute little mason jar with a few raspberries on top. (I hate raspberries, but we'll forgive them this one offense.) This dessert was light and delicious. And, should probably be incorporated into my Thanksgiving menu. I'm just sayin'.

We tried the Bone Marrow, and have to say it's not going to be on my bucket list. Restaurant did nothing wrong to it, just the texture and appearance doesn't appeal to me. Steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes and mushrooms on point.  Now for why we won't return. The tables are not large enough to hold two waters and two drinks, much less the food that was served. We were seated by the front door and once food was served, the crowd wouldn't leave us alone to eat as they felt compelled to be 'funny' and heard. Additionally the atmosphere and vibe is more bar than restaurant. It is too noisy, and too crowded.  Good food gets the 3 Star, the atmosphere scores a big zero for me. Too much competition out there to put up with this place.",

    "text": "I am very saddened to have to give this place a poor review. Mostly because of the wait and the food it just wasn't what I was expecting from a restaurant that has 4 positive star reviews. I was really looking forward to bringing my hubby to a great steak place for his birthday but I was just not happy with the meal.   When we first arrived our reservation had been for 8 o'clock but i asked to move it to 830 so that we can sit at a bigger table as opposed to one of the small roundtables. The hostess on the phone told me that that would be no problem in that 830 they would have a rectangular table ready for us to sit at and dine.   We arrived early and sat at the bar waiting for our table to be available I looked around and seen at least three or four Open tables at the time but I assumed maybe they had already been reserved for other couples. As we waited we both ordered an appetizer of mac & cheese and fried chicken liver.  It took about 15 minutes for appetizers to come out and by the time they did our table was ready. We grabbed our drinks and the woman guided us to a small roundtable I looked at her and said well we requested a square table and that's why we waited until 830 as opposed to 8 o'clock.  She stared at us as if she had no idea what we were talking about she said okay well just give me a minute. She came back two minutes later and decided to sit us at one of their 4 Seater square metal tables as opposed to the two-seater woodblock table. I didn't mind sitting there but when we sat down there was an awfully weird smell almost like mildew and the seats that we say in still had crumbs in it from the guest that were sitting there before us.   I wipe down my seat and didn't bother to complain. The waitress gave us menus and asked us if we wouldn't know what we wanted to order. of course after having waited for 30 minutes we already knew. We decided to get that 34 ounce ribeye meal for two. I was very excited about ordering the ribeye especially after seeing all the beautiful pictures on yelp about how tender and juicy was. But to my surprise when it finally came to the table and I tried to cut into it it wasn't as tender as I had first assumed. We ordered the steak medium and it was very pink on the inside so I knew they didn't mess up the cooking process. Once I had tasted it it lacked flavor tremendously as if they had just brought the steak from the store, cooked it up and threw it on our plates. I assume the steak in itself would be full of flavor and bursting with with with taste but it just wasn't it was flavorless and bland and the only thing that made me eat it was a steak sauce that accompanied it.  The mac & cheese wasn't too good either it lacked that very delicious cheesy taste that you get from most creamy mac & cheese dishes. I did however enjoy the chicken livers they were very soft and not too hard to chew but the breading kept falling off of each piece that I picked up which only defeated the purpose of it being fried in the first place.   A few slices through the steak I was so disappointed that I just decided to stop eating and just stuck to the potato wedges and mushrooms that came with the dish.  It was a Monday night when we went so they had a guest DJs come in and also a group of people advertising Pimm's gin liquor. There is another issue I had with this restaurant. The music should go according to the Environment. The DJ that they had hired to play music was playing it way too loud I almost felt like I was in a club even though I looked around and saw people casually dining. It didn't make sense to me at all. the free samples of gin may have been the only upside to that evening. I had informed them over the phone that it was my hubby's birthday soon but before we received the check we never even heard a mention about it.  Once I brought it up to the waitress she asked if we had any desserts in mind. I wasn't too excited about the regular food so dessert wasn't really an option for me. My hubby on the other hand really enjoyed the steak so he decided to get a dessert to maybe save the evening for me. the vanilla dessert was very delicious. i scraped the inside of the glass container just to savor  each bite.  By the end of the night after a few beers a cocktail in all the food we had ordered my bill was about $140 including the tip. I was very disappointed that I had spent so much money and was so dissatisfied I should've just stuck with my regional got it went to capital Grille where I have never been disappointed. Maybe this place has better options for lunch or brunch or maybe I should just order something else but either way I probably won't be returning to meat and potatoes anytime soon.",

Oh yea, just in case you want to impress your significant other, reserve tickets for the Theater Square right next door! They perform musicals from the Pittsburgh CLO company and it's a perfect place for a dinner/lunch date after you get your Meat and Potatoes on.   Parking is street or in a garage off 7th.

Everything we had was delicious! We ordered some devils on horseback, which I actually have never had before, and they were perfect! The dates were stuffed with chorizo and I was really surprised that there were not greasy in the slightest. We also got and order of brussel sprouts and smoked wings, both of which were satisfying. Knowing how amazing the tartare is at Butcher, I had to try it out at M&P. I really did like it. However, it may have been my least favorite of the appetizers. The Asian inspiration was not for me. i felt like I was eating a tuna tartare instead of my beloved steak! While I love both of them, it isn't a love that is equal by any means. The drinks were good and the bartenders were very impressive with how attentive they were! I was extremely happy overall with out meal.",

    "text": "Meat & Potatoes is a trendy eatery located in the Cultural District and right in the center of Theatre Square. Parking here is extremely easy, especially if you go into the parking lot located on 7th Street (I think it's called Theatre Square Parking Lot?) The restaurant itself its bustling, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, so make sure you call in advance or use Open Table to make a reservation. I came here last night for the second time to celebrate my boyfriend and I's anniversary. We had a reservation at 10 pm, since we were at Benedum Center for an opera. Upon arrival, we were seated within 5 minutes. The ambience is lively, classy, and has a wonderfully energetic aura about it. Our server immediately came over and brought water. Since my boyfriend and I were extremely hungry, we ordered as soon as she came over. We shared the bone marrow, which was a decadent appetizer served with grilled toast, parsley and pine nuts, sea salt, capers, and pickled onions. It was delicious! The only con may be that it's quite a heavy starter, especially considering all the prime choices of protein you can order. For dinner, my boyfriend had the leg of lamb steak, and I had the adobo pork shank. My boyfriend loved his meal (he's a sucker for lamb) and it was a perfectly sized portion that allowed you to get full but not full enough for dessert. The pork shank was amazing. As soon as I tried to cut off a piece, the entire shank just fell apart. The meat was tender, a little bitter, and had some underlying spice. All in all, a great dinner. We ended up ordering the pot de creme for dessert and it was one of the best ends to a dinner I could ever imagine. The chocolate was silky and just melted in your mouth. The freshly whipped creme and crumbles added light and crunchy textures that perfectly complemented the chocolate. After a few bites, it can get a little too sweet, but the dessert, itself, never gets heavy. Service here was the right balance of hands off and attentive. Our server checked in a couple times to make sure everything was tasting right and brought us water right as our water levels were diminishing. However, my boyfriend and I were never interrupted when we talked and had the chance to just enjoy each other's company. Overall, I'd say Meat & Potatoes is a winner. It's hard for me to pick one con about this place. As long as you make sure you have a reservation, you're golden.",

    "text": "Hmmm...I love meat and potatoes, so when a friend asked me to go there for her birthday I agreed knowing it was super expensive and upscale.  It's also located downtown which equates to #parkingnightmare.  I'd say bus down there, but busing anywhere in Pittsburgh takes an eternity.  I digress.  The food here is awful.  I got some kinda Bolognese Pasta, it tasted like dirty gym socks.  Not kidding.  The presentation was terrible, and it tasted warm as opposed to hot.  I'll do a warm hamburger from a fast food joint because they aren't charging $23, but not warm pasta from a place that has reservations and $50 and up plates.  They charge $5 or some shit for toast, so that's the kinda place this is.  The wine was delicious, but it's hard to mess up red wine for someone who imbibes as regularly as I do.  Had it not been for the wine, and company, I would probably 1 star it, but I'm no high class gal.  The service was ok.  They kept trying to take all of my silverware and plates before I was done with my dishes.  It's like, back up, I'm not even finished eating yet.  And I used to serve tables for a long time, so I know the difference between hovering over a table, and allowing someone to eat and enjoy their company.  Here's the kicker, a friend got the highest priced plate cause he's a baller (unlike myself), and well, it's supposed to come with MASHED POTATOES.  Well, they said, \"we're out of mashed potatoes, would you like french fries?\"  My eyes got so big, as did his, and we were like \"are you for real?\".  Their like \"yes, we ran out (on a friday night no less), so if you want mashed potatoes, we will have to make more for you\".  He said, \"Ummm...if I'm ordering a $50 plate of steak and potatoes, I don't wanna eat french fries\".  Seriously.  I was floored.  They were kinda rude about  him wanting mashed potatoes, too.  And, as you can imagine, it took a very long time to get our food.  The atmosphere in this place is cool, and our server was pretty efficient for the most part.  The birthday girl enjoyed her food (i think), but I wish we coulda just went to Thai Cuisine.  The steak looked greasy so I figured pasta",

However both steaks came out raw (actually cold in the middle). My wife sent hers back and it came back medium to medium well...typical BS kitchen response to undercooked steak...sent it back over cooked to prove they cooked it right the first time.  We gave up and didn't finish our meals.  Was surprised the waiter didn't say anything...we tipped him well as it wasn't his fault.  How this is number one is beyond comprehension.

Not to mention they have a \"Bloody Mary\"(for those Americans) or us Canadians like to call it, \"Caesars\" bar with all the right fixings!   This place is awesome if you want to come before a theatre show as it's connected to one of the major theatres. Be sure to make reservations though because it gets packed!  My fiance and I came for brunch and we are sad that we weren't able to go back for dinner because the brunch was more than satisfying and worth our every penny!   The fiance ordered the pub burger and I ordered the classic chicken and waffles. Let's start with the burger, it had a beautifully cooked fried egg to top and some yummy horseradish flavoured sauce that gave it the right zing! Of course it came with some shoe string fries on the side. Right size and good flavour, not your average burger!  My chicken and waffles was an absolute delight, my mouth waters just describing it. Firstly it was ginormous, I'm sort of embarrassed yet proud to say that I finished the whole darn thing. The chicken batter was light and crispy and the meat inside literally melted in my mouth, it was so juicy! The waffle the chicken sat on was any average eggo type waffle you find at the grocery store. This one was homemade and infused with jalapenos. It didn't stop here, my chicken and waffles came with bourbon maple bacon infused syrup that tied all of the loveliness together in one bite...  To no surprise we had no room for dessert as our second stomach failed us!   Another awesome thing about this place that I mentioned briefly before is the make your own Caesar station! You pick your alcohol base (I chose siracha tequila- yes it exists!) and you basically walk up to the bar area where they have all the garnishes you could ever think of for a Caesar, from bacon to celery to green beans to prosciutto to cabbage rolls! And there is no limit!   If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again I'll be sure to stop by here again, you should do the same!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to go to Meat & Potatoes for some time now. We finally got there a few weeks ago. My husband's boss from Sweden was in town and we wanted to take her somewhere nicer in town for dinner. Unfortunately when I called to make reservations no one answered. So we just decided to walk-in. I should have called again about reservations though instead of just winging it, because when we got there, the place was packed and the only availability they had for a half-hour was on the patio. We decided that was okay, ordered drinks at the bar and then were seated outside.  I know this is not the fault of the restaurant at all...but it was about 8:30pm on a weeknight, and as soon as we were seated we were greeted outside by obnoxious jack-hammering across the street. We decided this would be pretty annoying throughout our meal, so we asked the waitress if there was any possible way we could get a table inside. It took about another half-hour, but we were seated at a table in the restaurant.   We order the fried brussel sprouts as an appetizer. Unfortunately I did not think they were very good. I also thought it was weird appetizers are served in cardboard food boats you usually see at concession stands. I guess it was supposed to be ironic. So appetizer in general just wasn't too thrilling.  For my entree I had the duck, which was pretty delicious. My husband and his boss were also happy with their entrees despite the hiccups getting seated and the stinky appetizer.   Like I said, I know the jackhammer wasn't the restaurants fault. It just kind of put a bit of a damper on the rest of the experience. Maybe my expectations were also really high from all the buzz I heard about Meat & Potatoes. For the prices though I just didn't think it was 5 stars this time. I'd like to go back and try their brunch though. Perhaps that will make me add a star or two!",

My go-to dish is the pork chop...which has never let me down...until now The chop was seemingly undercooked (despite being ordered medium) and it's smoked flavor was definitely \"off\". In the past, the chop was akin to a deliciously smoked ham but not this time. I'm not sure if it was due to the amount of patrons ordering the dish that night and they were just pumping them out as quickly as possible, but I left there regretting my entree choice.   As for the rest of my experience that evening, I'd say it was average. The drinks were good and the service was as expected on a busy evening. However, with the main reason for going here being the food, I'll definitely think twice about returning any time soon.",

If you are going to try something a little more exotic, like the bone marrow, then I'd suggest you go with a few couples.  Have a few couples order things like bone marrow and have others order things like the Mac & Cheese (Out of this world).  That way everyone can share and you aren't stuck paying for something you may not care for.    In the end, my experiences at M&P have been pretty excellent.  They have a great drink selection and the food is generally very good.  I highly recommend the pork chop for dinner.  In spite of being very large it was so nice and juicy.  I'd say it was cooked to perfection.",

My grandmother and I were disappointed that they had gotten rid of their cheese and charcuterie board. The entrees were decent, but nothing that I felt could not be replicated elsewhere. That, for me, makes this a safe but overpriced option for Pittsburgh. Good for late night when nothing else is open but probably not much else.",

The portion size is excellent but the cut of meat is not the highest grade. The steak truly needs a sauce (their house steak sauce was very good), but any steak enthusiast will tell you that a great steak should never be tarnished with even a great sauce. The confit potatoes and buffalo Mac were very average. Service and atmosphere were great. Strictly based on the taste and quality of food and factoring in cost, I would not come here for the food. Very good for a pub steak but well below average for a steakhouse steak. Likely will not return.",

    "text": "I recently moved to the area a few months ago from NYC and was excited to bring my mother to the restaurant since I had a great brunch there once and I heard so many good things around town.  I had stopped in for a drink at the bar one night after work and had a good cocktail, but bar service was poor and had a hard time getting someone to close out my tab.  But figured it may have been an off night so still decided to try dinner.   My mother flew into town yesterday evening for the holiday and we stopped in for dinner around 7pm.  We were greeted by a nice gentleman and ordered a burger and the pork chop.  At 7:55pm our dinner still had not arrived and our server was nowhere to be found. When we located him, I asked him if he knew how much longer it would be.  He came back and his response included asking us how long it had been, he thought it had \"only been 20 minutes\".  First of all, it had been over 40 minutes and secondly, not an appropriate response to customers to re mediate the situation in my opinion.    The food came out 5 minutes later.  The burger was delicious!  The pork chop was huge and more of a shank size. It was more than disappointing.  The chop and the collard greens were oversoaked in the sauce.  The chop was overcooked (supposed to be medium, was medium well) and dry with little taste.  Maybe that is why they drench it in sauce for taste?  There was a poor portion of beans as well.  Definitely not worth the $28.  If someone does want to try it, I'd suggest sharing for two and generally I can eat huge portions, but this one was over the top.  Maybe if I had liked it, I would've eaten more...The waiter also never came back to check on us to see if we were satisfied with our food.  Lastly, the credit card machine was down and I had to fill out an old school slip.  But stuff happens and also being in the serving industry for years, I know that things go down from time to time, so nbd.    Overall, the experience was unsatisfactory. Ambiance is nice and the burger is amazing.  So far bar service and waiting service has been poor and needs major improvement.",

    "text": "In Pittsburgh for one night - this place had some great reviews - had to be done. I'm not familiar with Pittsburgh so didn't know if Parking would be an issue. Happy to discover there is very reasonable parking in the same building as the restaurant.   The inside was pretty full and busy, a little loud but not terrible. Some baffling would probably help a little bit with that.   As a starter I ordered their special Negroni and two small apps. The Negroni - in a word - was excellent. Here's what makes theirs different: Nolets Rose Petal Infused Dry Gin, Campari and Lillet Rouge (Fortified Wine). The fortified wine is a sub for the standard sweet vermouth - and it worked quite well. To accompany that I tried the  Grilled Bread with Goat Butter and Seasonal Jam and the Fried Brussels with Parmesan and Lemon Aeoli. The Brussels were very nice fried but I would have loved them as much if they were simply roasted. The combination of the slight bitterness of the Brussels Sprouts with the savory Parmesan and the ever so slight hint of sweetness in the Lemon Aeoli - was such a nice contrast. And then you switch to the grilled bread - and hit some other regions of the palate - tossing a sip of the Negroni - magic.   I could have stopped there but, as I was leaving the next day, wanted to try at least one of the Mains. So I ordered the Pappardelle - with Bolognese, Short Rib, Pancetta, Pork Shoulder and Garlic Bread on the side.  It was very well prepared and presented. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I hadn't already indulgent the apps. But that's my fault!   I ate at the bar and the servers there worked well as a team - both giving excellent and efficient and friendly service. Very professional. Would definitely come back!!",

I love how you could choose from any of the infused vodkas, and make it your own! Plus, the bacon was perfection. Third, get the brisket hash. You will not be disappointed!

I have been wanting to come here for years and just made it this weekend for a friend's birthday. Since it was her birthday, we made reservations for 10 in the private room in the back. This is was super fun and intimate for a group of friends- I would recommend it for a large group!   We started off with some drinks around the table. I wanted something different than I usually order, so I chose the Corpse Reviver. Highly recommended! We also started with the fried Brussels and fried pickles- both delicious! I was going back and forth between a few different items on the menu, but Chris convinced me to split the 45 oz ribeye with him.  We ordered the ribeye medium rare with the broccoli as our side and chimichuri sauce. Besides the fact that we had to send back the ribeye because it was almost completely rare, everything was so good!   The only thing disappointing was the service from our waiter. He was not friendly at all and seemed very annoyed with our group because we were chit chatting instead of looking at the menu. For as much money as we spent here, it would have been nice to have a better service experience. I look forward to coming back in the future and hopefully have a better experience.",

    "text": "Went here with a group for work.  We had been given a back room due to the size of the group, however with the weather, many flights were cancelled so we missing missing about 1/2 of what we should have been.   We were greeted when we came in, and were waiting for more of the group to show up.   When we were seated, we were missing 9 of the group.  There was a pre-printed menu on the tables with a partial selection from the main menu.  For me, I was disappointed because I already checked out the online menu and knew what i wanted, and none of it was on this menu!  When the wait person came around to take our orders, I asked her if I could have the lamb meatballs.  She promptly told me they don't have them and that i had to stick to the menu in front of me. Full disclosure, I didn't like her attitude.  There was plenty of food, we tried several apps had a salad option and entrees.  Each table ordered what ever apps they wanted but when they came out - they did not come to where they were ordered.  We were given fried pickles, and we did not order them and we had ordered 2 of the smoked wings and were given one.  There were two tables in the room so I do think better attention could have been paid.  The Plain Jane burger was just that - plain - nothing special.  The bar scene did look like the place to be.  However, I would not return to confirm this.",

So because I'm with my wife and kids after a day at the zoo, I can't be seated? Any other time when I'm in a suit with my business associates, we have no problem getting a table for 5 or 6 weird how you treat people poorly based on appearance. I asked her if we could wait or if she was just turning me away. All she said was that I could go to Pork n' Bean and that's about all she could do for us. I asked again and she just said no, they will not seat us. Totally unprofessional and prejudicial. I emailed management about the issue and guess what, no response. I wish I could give zero stars.",

DJ setting the mood in the corner. Folks making their custom Bloody Marys at the BM bar.  Saw folks with picks full of all sorts of stuff. Skipped alcohol today but got some great brunch items with my two friends.   The BEST part of brunch was the special dessert.  A deconstructed sweet potato cheesecake in a jar. Each of us had one. Each spoonful went deeper into the delicious layers. I honestly don't know exactly what was in it but it didn't matter.  It was amazing!!!",

The stuffed french toast came with malted peanuts and aside from being completely delicious, filled me up for the entire remainder of the day without really costing all that much. My partner's croque madame was also delicious and was equally large, decadent, and reasonably priced.  My only knock would be that the menu was a little limited; There was really only one item that appealed to me at all upon looking at it.",

Loved the ambiance of the restaurant, definitely a great place to go for date night or to celebrate a special occasion.  Cocktails (4/5): We all enjoyed our drinks and the prices weren't too bad either.  Caesar Salad (5/5): highly recommend ordering, it was amazing! The crunchy pork rinds and crispy pig ears complimented the salad perfectly and the addition of the egg was also unique.  Roasted Duck Breast (4/5): really enjoyed the duck, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. However, I don't eat polenta so I asked to sub a side potato dish instead which the server said I could, but did not inform me that there would be an additional $4 charge for this. Would have been nice to know.  45 oz Ribeye for Two (3.5/5): the first ribeye they brought out was rare so we had to send it back. I found it odd that the bone marrow wasn't served with any toast or bread because it was really oily eating it by itself. Chimichurri and horse radish sauces were decent.   Truffle Fries (5/5): great fries, loved the aioli.  Overall a great spot for dinner downtown. Will be back the next time I come to Pittsburgh.",

We also ordered the eggs and hash which tasted amazing - but definitely not on the healthy side!   I love blood marys, but I am not a fan of (anything) spicy - these were the perfect mixture! Kudos to them on the mix. They have a blood mary bar which I'm sure you could add spice if you prefer, but we had the bartender make ours.   The only complaint I have is with the service. The waitress didn't take our drink order for a long time after we were seated, then it took a long time for her to take our food order, and then (you guessed it) a long time to provide and process our check. I would expect a better service experience anywhere, but especially here. Luckily, we planned for a long lunch or we would have been late for the show!!",

    "text": "If you're looking to eat come here. You'll get a healthy amount of portions with your entrees. The website recommended making reservations so I made one through Yelp (thanks Yelp ).   Order: Pork - A huge pork chop with sweet spicy collard greens. Topped with a sauce that had a bit of a tangy and mint taste to it. I can't forget to mention the two pieces of perfectly good pork slices on the top of the chop. Those two pieces were the highlight of the meal. The waiter ensured I was aware of possibly raw pieces. It seemed to be cooked pretty good when I cut through it. This takes me to cutting the pork. It was tough to cut through the thick piece of meat. Perhaps a better knife would have helped. I made it through half of the pork chop before I called it quits from being stuffed.   Wagyu - This fine piece of meat was delicious. This entree was the only entree that did not come with as much portions as the others. It was satisfying though. It came with a mashed type of potatoes with a light sauce.   Three Little Pigs - This was a pretty big sandwich full of different types of pork, cheese and a fried egg. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered it so I ended up cutting it for her since it was big and thick. She enjoyed it.   Don't forget the dessert! Peanut Butter and Jelly cheesecake is a must! It was so yummy. It was topped with peanuts so if you're not a big fan you may want to remove them. After all it's peanut butter and jelly! I enjoy it.   Service was pretty good. Our waiter checked us frequently and was nice.   Reservations:  One thing I found odd was reservations for a party of 2 showed 8pm was available and when I edited it to a party of 3 it changed it significantly to 9pm. I called the restaurant to check if I could go at 8 and they said 9 was the earliest for a party of 3. We got to the restaurant, a bit early (they were cleaning our table at 8:50). We were offered a table outside in order to sit immediately. The table we sat at could fit a total of 4. Why weren't we offered to sit there in order to be seated at 8pm - I'm not sure. It wasn't an option given over the phone. In my situation it wasn't a deal breaker. We came at 9pm. However it could have been a deal breaker for others.   The reviews mention it's not kid friend. I believe because it's only open for dinner and has a huge bar. We didn't get a glimpse inside since we sat outside but the bar appeared to be busy.   Overall we enjoyed our dinner and would come back if we were in the area.",

    "text": "I haven't been here in probably a year, hoping for a better experience. Seriously, fix the horrible service. One of the hostesses clearly has no clue what she's doing (the other was friendly and helpful).  We sat for over 15 min without anyone coming to our table. They were busy, but there were several open tables outside, so not at capacity. I finally asked the hostess for a server and when she finally arrived, told me that there was a miscommunication. Ok, that happens.   But then my drink order came half way through appetizers (which came out without plates, which we had to go get ourselves), and no one checked on us until our meal was over. When she finally asked how our food was, she had our bill already in hand to usher us out. Our drinks had been empty most of the meal.   Unfortunately, this has been the norm here. The food is great, but the service is so far below the caliber of the other restaurants in this group. There is some attitude that doesn't even make sense.  Sadly, I won't be back. I used to eat here every single weekend.   The review below is months old and realized I didn't post it. Great to see things haven't improved.   Please. Fix. Your. Service. I'm a frequent visitor to all of the restaurants in this group for client entertainment and because I live downtown and eat out almost daily. I came in for brunch today by myself. There was a seat at the bar. One of the bartenders had the worst attitude I've seen in a long time. I don't know her name, but she was wearing lots of cats. She was obviously miserable at work period, but she made my visit miserable too. I was sitting on the corner by the Bloody Mary bar initially, but the adjacent seat opened up. To give more room to the patrons at the bar, I mentioned that I was going to shift down a seat and asked whether it would be a problem. She glared and informed me that it would be a little bit of a problem (presumably because she had to shift my seat in the computer). Really? I get you have to shift the order from one seat to another, but it happens. Do not make your customers feel like they are an obligation or burden. I just shifted a seat to give more room to the bar.  The attitude continued the rest of my meal. The patrons next to me commented that she should have never come in to work today.  I've worked in service, be nice and you make more money!!  I give 3 stars because I love the food here. My sweet potato pancakes and granola were fantastic as usual. I also appreciated brunch with fun, but reasonably boiled music! But please, do something about your service. Your other sister-restaurants don't suffer from this problem and it has been getting worse over the past year at M&P.",

You should definitely make reservations for this restaurant. We forgot to do so, but we came at a weird time on a Monday so we were able to get a spot, but if you're coming at a regular lunch or dinner time, I would recommend you make a reservation. This place gets really packed!  Something small, but the chairs are incredibly comfortable! They were like chairs that I would have in my living room. The whole place in general was nice, simple, and classy. We ordered the Brisket Mac & Cheese, Poutine, and Salmon. The Brisket Mac & Cheese and Poutine were amazing. What I liked the most was the salmon. They used a different rice I've tasted before and the kimchi had a different, but good flavor to it that I've never tried.",

I highly recommend eating at Meat &Potatoes if you visit or live in Pittsburgh.  What we had * Meatloaf - Slap your Grandmom twice if she tries to get a taste. This dish was amazing! 5 stars  * Pork Chop - Huge! Definitely will have leftovers. The pork chop was juicy and tender. 5 stars  * Three Little Pigs Sandwich - When we saw the size of this sandwich we were like WHOA! The sandwich was big enough for 2 people to eat. And the fact that it had bacon, Pork Milanese and ham made the sandwich that much more amazing! 5 stars  * French Toast Dessert- This was a let down! The only good thing about this dish was the ice cream. 2.5 stars",

The only downside is that the place takes reservations and if you come without one, you will have to sit at the bar (if you are lucky) all the while watching as tables around you are mysteriously empty. It's also a tiny bit too expensive, making it a special occasion place, not an everyday affair. For those of you worried that this place isn't good for vegetarians, they usually have something on the menu to satisfy those who find meat unappetizing. If you ask for them to make a dish (such as the huevos rancheros) without meat, they will oblige. While they do love meat, last time we went in, our server also reminded us that \"potatoes is also part of our name.\"",

Chicken and Waffles: Amazing, if not even a little intimidating. M&P takes a new twist on a Southern classic with three huge pieces of fried chicken, jalapeno/cheddar Belgian-style waffles and a bourbon-bacon maple syrup, which was still hot when it came to the table. It was so much food, I could not finish it at the table. Even better reheated the day after.  Huevos Rancheros: Now, Bob and I make this dish at home all the time. For those of you that are unfamiliar, it's a baked/grilled or fried corn or flour tortilla, top it with meat  (chorizo or in M&P's case...chunks of pork), top it with a sunny side up egg or two, a mound of cheese and some ranchero sauce. It's like a Mexican breakfast wrap on steroids. And it's damn good. M&P did not disappoint, and they made it prettier. It was an amazing tower of Mexican flavor explosion.  Ambiance/Atmosphere: We got there right when they opened. We were first in line, and while I'm bad a judging if you need reservations at any place, we were LUCKY we got in. We made a point to be there before they opened, just in case...and we were glad we did. The place filled up in about 15 minutes after we got seated. Service was amazing, and the waitstaff really took care of each other and made sure every aspect of the dining experience was covered. I dropped my spoon from my coffee (which was good!) by accident and 2 seconds later they'd replaced it. Even the owner of M&P was there, helping out and serving. I like that.  Things we didn't try but should have: Red Velvet Pancakes. They also had a Bloody Mary Bar, but considering I don't like tomato juice, it didn't impress me. Really wanted an Old Canadian, but considering it was early, I didn't feel proper doing it.  Will go there again, for realz.",

The portion was huge and I would have gladly eaten the curry broth as a soup!  We got the meat and potatoes for two, which was cooked absolutely perfectly and we ate almost all of the gigantic portion. Although slightly under salted, it was a great presentation and a very nice cut of ribeye. Our dessert, some type of chocolate pot de creme, was delicious as well.

Great flavor, but they serve their cocktails in very wide saucer glasses. This just warms up the drinks more quickly than a smaller glass, and a warm cocktail is no one's friend. They pour their wine generously, and the glass selection is great.  I had fries -- fine, but the flavored mayo that came with them lacked flavor. Then I had the harvest salad, which was nice, but strangely cold, like it had just been taken from a fridge. I liked the spare dressing, however. Next came one of the night's specials -- grilled cheese with tomato soup. The soup was great. The sandwich was cold and I only ate one bite of it.  Maybe with more time they'll get their game on.

While the bartender was friendly, he didn't know the menu very well and kept having to get back to us regarding our questions on the specials and menus (ie, was there meat in the heuvos rancheros, did the omelet come with any sides, etc).   Also, the service at the bar was very slow because they were too busy making drinks to be attentive to those individuals eating at the bar.   Having said that, my breakfast was pretty delicious.  I ordered the omelet special which was filled with cheese, sausage and peppers.  They were able to substitute soy sausage in it for me and it was oh-so flavorful.  I know soy sausage sounds a little gross but I highly recommend it.  I also came directly after a 14-mile run and was freezing.  I was craving a steaming cup of hot chocolate and much to my chagrin, they don't serve hot chocolate!  Between the lack of hot chocolate and the slow service, I was a little disappointed with my first time here.  Having said that, I'm going to give it a try for dinner and hopefully sample the pumpkin ravioli and some tasty drinks.",

The truffle aioli served with the fries is so great that you will want to eat only that, every night of the week.  Brunch on weekends is amazing as well, and there is a build your own bloody mary bar.  They have mixologists on staff and the cocktails might be the best in town.

We started with the cheese plate, which was head and shoulders above every other cheese plate I've ever had.  It was full of new and interesting flavors, all of which paired perfectly.  Dinner was the duck - again, wonderful, complex flavors all of which played together in surprising and delightful ways.  Since the first two courses were so wonderful, dessert was a must - rich, decadent pot de creme.  Wow.  Since I'm expecting, I was sadly unable to sample the cocktail offerings, but there were a ton, and they all looked awesome.  The bar featured an absenthe fountain - seriously.  As other reviewers stated, seating is a little small and crowded.  This wasn't a problem for us, but we had no trouble chatting up our neighbor table in typical friendly Pittsburgh fashion.  If you're looking for a private and intimate setting, this is not it.  It is, however, fun and \"casual upscale.\"  We will definitely be back.",

With our reservation we were seated right away (instead of the 45 min wait the previous time). The food was fantastic! Our waiter however, was either stretched too thin with tables or just plan bad!

    "text": "Meat & Potatoes is my favorite brunch spot in Pittsburgh! I highly recommend making reservations, especially if there is a show or game in town.  The first time my husband and I visited, we did not have reservations--but we arrived right when they opened; we were able get get seats at the bar., however, within 15 minutes of sitting down, there was not one seat left at the bar.  My husband and I both had a blood orange and caramelized pineapple Bellini-- it wasn't on the menu, but the bartender recommended it--simply delicious!   My Husband ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit special-- scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, and cheese served on a giant homemade biscuit, with truffle mayo and a side of frittes. I had the omelette special, which had blue cheese and mushrooms, served with a side of their au gratin potatoes. Both meals were phenomenal!   My mom came with me on my next visit to M&P for brunch before we headed over to the Benedum to see a show. I made reservations a few weeks in advance, and I'm glad I did-- I overheard the hostess tell the party in front of us there would be a 1.5 hour wait!   We were seated upon arrival, and our waiter Shane was at our table in no time! My mom and I both opted for the Bloody Mary bar--we both had the garlic and black pepper infused vodka, and proceeded to top our bloody's with the amazing variety of toppings available. It's hard to believe the Bloody Mary bar is only $5!   For our meal, I had the BPLT and my mom got the Quiche of the day. My sandwich was delicious; this version of a simple classic had arugula, pastrami belly, thick cut bacon, ripe tomatoes, and truffle mayo all wedged between two pieces of grilled bread. I don't remember exactly what was in the quiche, but I think it had pork, peppers and scallions. It is served room temperature, which I found a little odd, but the flavors were amazing. It was served along side a house salad, which really balanced the dish nicely. We finished our meals with a cup if coffee, which was also delicious!  The service is impeccable, the drinks are fantastic, the food is stellar, and the manager stops to talk to the tables (which is a nice touch). I highly recommend stopping in for brunch in the very near future!",

I'll list the positive first: good food. It is good,but not great and for what they charge, it should be great. I ordered the Kobe beef with a sweet and savory sauce with fingerling potatoes. The sauce needed to be mixed together and that was not explained in the menu or from the waitress (more in that in a bit) so my first couple bites were actually disappointing. My wife tried a salad, which was good but not memorable. I was also disappointed with the lackluster beer list and the decor. It's designed to look old but with the Christmas pine cones, it looked 'dirty old' and was not appetizing. Also, seating was uncomfortably tight. I sat too close to people on either side with wait staff bumping our table while standing too close to take orders. Lastly, on the decor, they don't have their own bathrooms! You need to use the theater. I was recently in a restaurant in Dallas that was awarded one of the top 5 bathrooms in Dallas. I didn't know there was someone keeping a list but if they went here, they would be very disappointed. Finally I wasn't impressed by the staff. The people greeting didn't seem happy to be there and our waitress didn't explain anything on the menu and seemed not to know about it. When my wife asked about the speciality salad, she shrugged and said\"I don't know; I don't like warm salads.\" When I asked for a recommendation, she merely told me the top 4 entry items were most popular. I feel the only reason this restaurant is popular is: A: it's near the theater and B: Pittsburgh doesn't have too many places to compete for fine dining... yet.",

    "text": "\"So if she's ordering whiskey you can assume she's clearly comfortable with herself, knows what she wants and has no problem making it happen - regardless of what anyone else at the bar might think.\" - Elite Daily, 10 Reasons Why You Should Always God For The Girl Who Drinks Whiskey   When I moved to a new city and realized that some of my social interests were different than many of my fellow college graduates, I found myself exploring restaurants and bars in downtown, because that's where I wanted to be: in the city. I was first introduced to Meat & Potatoes (M&P) in Pittsburgh's Theatre Square, by a colleague. Several weeks later, I found myself going back, by myself. There is a weird stigma about women going to bars alone but if you know what you like (drink wise and environment wise) then, go for it! I love going out alone to enjoy a drink or meal alone. M&P is the perfect location and environment for such a night. Why? Because it lays somewhere near casual fine dining and brings the working professionals and artsy culture of Pittsburgh together, under one roof. It's a place where I know I will get great service, a stellar Manhattan (I like mine with Blanton's and 2 cherries) and a great seat for people-watching across their large but cozy bar. I've been to M&P so many times now that the bartenders know me by name - whether that is a good thing or not, is up to you. I've enjoyed an hour or more to myself at M&P but, I have also had some fantastic conversations late into the night with those visiting Pittsburgh or locals who also love this spot.  If you are looking for dinner, make a reservation and you will be in store for a whirl! M&P's dinner menu is home to a variety of quality cuts of meat and fish but their mushroom risotto and sprouts are drool-worthy as well. Their weekend brunch and bloody mary bar is one of the best in Pittsburgh but be sure to make a reservation or you won't get a seat!   I went through this phase where I would be craving a great bar environment and I would want to try a new place in town. I am all for trying new spots but, there is a certain time in the night where you simply shouldn't fix what's not broken. Don't walk across the city if what you love is standing in front of you. On a late night's I have gotten into the habit of ordering fernet and coke at the bar, along with their signature espresso panna cotta. Yummy!  Get a group of friends or co-workers together, or venture out alone for a great time and drink at Meat and Potatoes. And, don't forget the whiskey. Pittsburgh is a Meat and Potatoes kind of town, and M&P is where you want to be if you are a downtown dweller or visitor!  - xoxo, A  (A California Girl Living in Pittsburgh on Purpose)",

I ordered a pre meal drink with an appetizer plus a glass of wine with the main course.  The drink and appetizer arrived almost together, in a reasonable amount of time.  Like magic when I finished them both, the dishes and utensils  were removed and my glass of wine and main course arrive along with new utensils.  I was asked if I needed anything else only once while I ate and when it appeared that I was finished, I was asked if I wanted dessert (which I declined) or the bill.  It was like the wait person was keeping an eye on what was happening at my table and acting appropriately when it appeared I needed their services leaving me to enjoy my meal in peace.  I was not harassed with constant questions about needing something, my needs being addressed without having to ask or wait for service.  Highly recommend this establishment and if I lived in Pittsburgh would very happily come back to enjoy another meal.",

    "text": "While looking for a restaurant that's open on Sunday night, we remembered that we had not yet had dinner here, so made a quick reservation (a must) and made our way to the Cultural District (not Squirrel Hill, as it erroneously says here on Yelp). My first impression was positive, as I like the decor and look of the place, with its high ceilings, plush velvet banquet seating and streamlined, Steampunk vibe; kind of butchery meets 19th century cafe. The bar is in the center of the room, and it was lively, even on a Sunday evening. Service was prompt and helpful, and we decided to each have the caesar salad and share some apps. The caesar here is non traditional and delicious, with both cracklins and chicharron standing in for croutons, pickled green tomatoes adding zest and a fried egg on top for richness. This is a fantastic salad, considerably more hefty than the original version with all of the protein and fried elements, but playful and surprisingly well balanced. We shared the fried chicken livers, the ahi tuna taquitos, and a special of the night, pork belly with mole, corn esquites and pickled cabbage. The fried chicken livers were delicious...perfectly cooked and served with a rather spicy dipping sauce. The ahi taquitos were good too, and provided a little relief from the richness of the other two dishes. They feature ahi ceviche stuffed into tiny hard taco shells and topped with cilantro and a yummy drizzle of their sauce. These are spicy and rather addictive. The special was excellent. They achieved succulent perfection in the preparation of their pork belly, which the server told us was braised, but which had a lovely caramelized exterior, so perhaps it was finished under the salamander. The fat had not been rendered away, and was meltingly soft. A decadent indulgence. I am sometimes loath to order mole at any restaurant, as I'm so often disappointed, but their's was very good, not too sweet and not overly spicy. The pickled cabbage provided a nice counterpoint to the full bodied pork and sauce, and the corn was delicious. Overall, excellent food served in a fun atmosphere. This is not everyday food for me, as I treasure my arteries, but you can order fish here, and you don't have to eat fried food, beef or pork belly to have a good meal. The drink menu is interesting and not overly pricey, and the wine list is well thought out. I'll be returning.",

However, I had a wonderful meal; the double cut stuffed pork chops.  We sat outside in October, and since there was a little chill in the air, I was very happy to have the warm blanket for my shoulders.  I couldn't finish my entree, but left very happy and will definitely be back.",

The service is always excellent.  Definitely need to make a reservation though.  They have a comfortable waiting area outside the dining room, along with outdoor seating that's super cute during nice weather.  The pork belly tacos were unreal, and they had an eggnog pana cotta for the holiday's that was to die for.  Meat & Potatoes is probably my favorite place in downtown Pittsburgh.  I hear they have a killer brunch, but I haven't tried it yet!",

We found one for the two of us (of course) but decided to stake our territory anyway with the one chair and to grab another when one freed up, which took some waiting and work including dealing with a rude old man...  Aside from that I love the dark interior of M & P with the mirrors and gold trim surrounding the room. It adds a nice element of elegant coziness.   The bartenders greeted us and were kind enough to give us a sample of the beers we were interested in trying. Ordered the Oscar and my bf ordered the Kobe Flat Iron. Oscar had a cut of veal, a fried soft shell crab on top and a side of risotto. Delicious - kind of on the salty side but I like it that way. I ate every bite but I had a hard time cutting with the knives they gave me (first butter knife then was given a steak knife when realized I was cutting with a butter knife). And the service continued to be great - the bartenders checked in periodically, were friendly and didn't push you out of  M & P. They let you soak in the experience and we did.",

Were seated later at our table in the main area, which is very lively and stylish, very well suited for a relaxed conversation. Great atmosphere!   The food was VERY good. The meat was prepared really well. I had pork belly tacos and hubby had bone-in filet, both cooked to perfection, followed by dessert served in a glass jar. Servers were polite and attentive.   The only downside was that the filet (that was on special and was not listed in the menu) turned out to cost almost twice as much as the most expensive item on the regular menu, a small thing that our server \"forgot\" to mention. Even though my husband thoroughly enjoyed it and would have ordered it anyway, it would have been nice to mention it in advance, as you don't generally expect a price of $56/entree in a place that has $20-25/entrees in their menu. Hence minus one star.   Otherwise it was a wonderful evening and we will come back. But please, do mention the price next time!",

We ordered fried chicken livers which were super crisp but cold bloody livers inside, sent the back and they refried the same order only to burn them and reserve. We sent them back only to find they were left on our bill and our waiter did not return after running our credit cards. My pastrami crusted duck was served on whole wheat spatzle, the spatzle was fried and burnt to the point where it had the consistency of pistachio shells (inedible).

The moules were ok. The mussels were like warm, but the sauce was hot. The soft shell crab was not soft. We pulled out bones/shells in every bite. The frites with black truffle mayo were amazing. The tartare was slimy and fishy. We sent it back because it tasted so unseasoned and almost rancid. The manager told us the chef made a new batch. When it came it was just as bad as the first batch. We have been here before several times and have always ordered the tartare. It has always been really good. This one lacked any flavor. You could tell the didn't add an acid or mustard or anything. We sent the second batch back too. yuck. I would not return. In addition, they overcharged our bill by up charging our drinks and other orders. I would not return. There are better places to go...

Instead of simply leaving us at the bar, the owner came over twice to apologize and comp us a round of drinks and two flatbread appetizers.  That level of attention and care for customers is unique, and our group was still talking this morning about how well we were treated.     Apart from the excellent service, the food was delicious.  We had the bone marrow, tartar and pate appetizers, all of which were great.  The boys had the chicken pot pie, meatloaf and sweetbreads for dinner. These were big hits.

    "text": "Love this place. I was in Pittsburgh for a business trip and I really wanted to try a good place to dine downtown. Every body recommended the Primanti Bros, and no..I didn't want that. It didn't fit in my mouth. Then, someone I worked with recommended this place and Nola. I chose Meat and Potatoes as I didn't find it necessary to eat Cajun food in Pittsburgh. My coworker, Joe, and I had to wait about 30 minutes before we got sat. At first, they said 1 hour. But nice that they offered to call so we could at least walk around. So, I definitely recommend to make a reservation. It's definitely the happening place in town. When we were walking around, none of the nearby restaurants were half as crowded as Meat & Potatoes. The foods were awesome too, and I had a hard time ordering as I wanted to try several things. Joe was daring and ordered bone marrow for us to try for appetizer. He asked me if I had it - of course, I had. There aren't that many things I haven't tried. Well, it was his first time. He lost his bone marrow virginity that night. He liked it. I ordered one of my favorite meals ever, moules frites which were mussels and fries. It was tasty. Joe ordered gnocchi with short ribs. I loved my meal and if I were in town again, I'd come back in a heart beat.",

    "text": "This was my fourth and least favorite visit, so I'm treating this as an anomoly for M&P.  We started with the Tartare (his choice) and Ahi Taquitos, followed by two specials: Lamb Belly (his) and Mahi over chowder.  We finished with a shared chocolate pot de creme.  From the cocktail menu, the Aviation and the barrel aged Manhatten were ordered.  I usually order the delicious Fried Brussels, but passed on them this time to try some new items...note to self ALWAYS get the Fried Brussels!!   The cocktails were very good, but, also very expensive...they so well made that I would order again! The Tartare was okay, but, the main flavor was salt...loved the soft boiled egg on top. The Ahi Tacquitos were overwhelmed by the dense mini corn tacoshell and the entire appetizer just tasted of corn taco...the corn taco shell tasted like like a store bought, big brand name, taco.   The Lamb Belly entree was ambitious, but, it didn't have a huge amount of flavor; the Mahi, over a thin layer of potato/sausage chowder, was a much better choice, but, still only ~4 stars due to a disconnect between the mahi and the chowder. The chocolate pot de creme is a standard, and was delicious, as usual. The service was fine, no complaints there...but the mirror behind us seemed to be a distraction to our server, as she often watched herself attend to our table.  We will be back, as the menu is so varied and the flavor combinations are always fun...we will just choose more wisely, next time!",

    "text": "Love the atmosphere, love the over-the-top \"meat culture\" shtick on the menu and in the decor!  This joint, right smack in the groin of the Cultural District, has a huge lively bar yet is still comfortably appointed for foursomes on the perimeter.  We had two awesome appetizers - the Escolar (a seviche) and the Watermelon Salad, with feta, olives and a lime vinaigrette.  The main course was a nice try, but not a perfect 10 on execution: Soft Shell Tacos, consisting of soft shell crab, pickled carrots and cucumber salad, cilantro and Thai chili sauce.  The taste combination was interesting but I found the tartness of the pickled carrots overpowered the poor crab, who showed up dutifully for work, all dressed up, and ended up with a little desk near the file room.  But, hey, perhaps that's what I get for ordering crab at a \"meat\" place ... sometimes you have to take credit for your own poor choices.  I still approve of this joint, and I love that you can still find a meal downtown at 10pm on a weeknight amid the hustle and bustle of the Pittsburgh theater jet-set.",

    "text": "Every time I have been to this restaurant it has been very busy.  They have a really weird reservation system too!   So the first time I visited was after the theater, we did not eat just had a cocktail and I mean one as the bartender that evening was too busy with some guys and the absinthe machine to ever get back to us for a second drink.  But we still vowed to return to eat.  So the second time we go for Sunday brunch, it is very busy, there were 3 of us but we managed to find 2 seats at the bar. We wanted to eat at the bar but they make you put your name on the list as it is reservations there too.  Unfortunately they have super vapid hostesses who seem to have no facial recognition or clue as to what they are doing.  So while sitting there we are seeing some food coming out and the Chicken and Waffles looks delicious.  The bartender Cecil was pretty fantastic. But then a server comes to inform the bartenders that  they are out of the chicken.  So after sitting awhile (the place had pretty much cleared out by then) the hostess finally comes over to move us to the other side of the bar .We thought this to be very odd!  Which was still dirty from previous customers and then needed to be cleaned, as we stood there and waited.  I ended up with the breakfast Americano which was a typical breakfast but with a house made sausage link and that was very good.  My other friend got short rib hash also very tasty and the other got the grilled cheese,  which he said was the \"best grilled cheese he had ever had\" All in all everyone was happy with that visit.   The third time we try to go again it was for Sunday brunch as we really wanted to try that Chicken.  But it was a no go as my one friend has very little patience and when they told us we couldn't wait at the bar she wanted to leave. So we went somewhere else that day.   The fourth time we had a party of six and had made a reservation and they gave us the private room.  I finally got that Chicken and Waffles along with two of my other friends and I was extremely disappointed as were they!  While the chicken itself was moist and juicy the breading lacked any flavor at all (seriously Shop n Save has better fried chicken) and the waffle was dry too!  Now it comes with a bourbon, bacon syrup which was tasty but the waffle itself broke apart when you touched it with the fork.  And four of the six had the house made sausage patty that day and the four of us that ate it got ill.  I was relating this some other people who said that also got ill after eating here. Mental note:\"No more sausage here\"!  Even after that a couple of months later I with two friends were in town for the Arts Festival and wanted to have a couple drinks and apps so we try to go here and it was extremely busy again and we decided to go elsewhere.  So I think in all of my visits it is either hit or miss the service is generally good with the exception of Cecil the bartender who is very welcoming and friendly.   The hostesses vapid (every time I have been there).  The food good some days and not so great others.  But I would still like to try dinner perhaps one day when there is a blizzard!",

    "text": "I just went to Meat and Potatoes this weekend with a group of people. We made the reservations over a month in advance because it is such a small restaurant that it was hard to get in with a group of 10. Between all of us we tried a variety of different things on the menu. Appetizers- the Devils on Horseback were surprisingly good. I didn't think I would like them, but they were probably the best app we had. They has a fried Mac and cheese appetizer special which several people tried and it was nothing to write home about. The corn dog was pretty good, but had some kick to it! For entrees - I got the pot roast, which was pretty good by pot roast standards. The hanger steak was too small of a portion for the meat lover in our group but they said it was great. The pork chop was GIANT and really juicy, but the slaw side that came with it was too spicy for me. And the duck was excellent. Our service was pretty good and the drinks were delicious, but pricey. All in all an exceptional meal, and will go back, but maybe not worth the month and a half of anticipation!",

Even with reservation, we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, which was a bit annoying. The ambiance was nice overall. The decorations were great and we loved the worn mirrors along the wall. Because it was so packed and the tables were so close together, it was difficult for J and I to have conversations. It was easier to have conversations with the people seated next to us. J and I started our meal with grilled bread and friend taters, which were pretty decent. For our main meal, J ordered the pot roast and I had the roasted chicken. Overall the food was pretty good. Very flavorful and large portions, which was great because we had lunch for the following day.  For dessert, I had a lemon berry custard cake and J had the chocolate mouse. Both were delicious. I think if we went on a less busy day, we may have had a better experience.",

While waiting to be sat, another hostess came over & started complaining about a customer loudly in front of us. She was told to hush but continued to talk about him. It was a really bad first impression. Then another hostess came over & threw the iPad that they use to seat customers onto the stand (hard enough that I expected to see it broken) & the original hostess talked about her under her breath. My fiance & I felt awkward, it was obvious they were all miserable & didn't really respect the restaurant...& this all happened within our first few minutes there!  We liked the decor, but I couldn't stop staring at the layers of dust above us. I know I probably eat a lot of dust daily, but I really don't want to see thick dust overhead at a nice restaurant. Service was slow, we didn't even get our drinks until we were half way done eating!  The food was great though! I had the French toast & my fiance had the chicken & waffles...everything we ate was delicious! I just wish the people working were nicer! When you spend over $50 for breakfast food, you expect to be treated well. The nicest person we encountered was the guy running food to tables.  I really can't imagine we would go back anytime soon. Again, kudos to the chef because the food was GREAT...we were just really disappointed with everything else. Also, it turned out that the guy the hostess was complaining about was Kris Letang! Not cool. Let go Pens!",

The first time I had reservations and we still were asked to wait 30 minutes for our table to be prepared. When we sat down there were at least 5-6 open tables. The restaurant is pretty small. The meal was good though. I had a Manhattan and the Waygu flat iron steak and my friend had the duck. Both were delicious.  On my second visit we again had to wait for quite some time even with having reservations and the teeny bopper that was our hostess had an attitude. We were seated and waited for an extremely long time. They were out of many things including the fried pickles and so we ordered the Devils on horseback. They were alright. We waited even longer for our food and my flat iron steak fell flat this time. It was cold as was the pasta that our friend ordered. I was extremely disappointed and have to say for the long wait and poor service I would expect decent food. For the price and other reasons combined I don't think Meat and Potatoes will be on my list of places to frequent. There are a lot of better and more reliable options in Pittsburgh",

Our drinks arrived promptly and were delicious - it's worth noting that the drinks here aren't your standard Jack and Ginger, and perhaps when you have to add an egg white to a mixed drink, it's going to take some time.   The food was good and came to our table quickly. Pro tip, if you wait fifteen minutes after your food is served to eat it, it will be a) cold and b) not the restaurant's fault.   The service - we had Ashlee, the same server - was attentive and friendly. The music was a normal level for a hip restaurant. If you're expecting secluded silence you won't get it, but it wasn't distracting at all.  All in all, we had a great experience from start to finish.",

We had an amazing brunch on Sunday and the bloody mary bar was also top notch.   I got the chicken and waffles and they were delicious! Not to mention the fact that you get, like, a mountain of fried chicken to go along with the cheddar an jalapeno waffle with the bourbon bacon syrup.  It was a ton of food but I couldn't stop eating it.  It was one of the best means I've had in a long time.    My wife had the Brisket & Eggs and it was equally delicious.  I only tried a bite as I had a lot of work to do, but I would have no problem ordering that dish next time we go there.    To go along with the fantastic food was the music!  Vex was playing some very appropriate, nice music that stretches well beyond Top 40 standards.  I was impressed by the stuff he was playing and I think the music was perfect for Sunday brunch.

MUSSELS OF THE DAY- traditional type.  These were tasty BUT I KNEW these were gonna be salty when we ordered and I was right.  I am feeling dehydrated hours later as I write this.  I prefer my mussels cooked in sauce that is more drinkable so you can sop it up.      PUB BURGER- I suppose there was no living up to the fantastic burger I had earlier this week at Burgatory.  This burger was a sad burger in comparison.  Not really to my liking, a little too soggy and lacking in tomato.  The fries were good, crispy and hot.      WAGYU FLAT IRON- My companion claims this was not real wagyu.  Overall it won a rating of \"OKAY\" from him but for 28 dollars, an okay is pretty sad.  Probably will not be back.

After getting very good cocktails at the bar (sloe gin fizz and glenshaw sour) we were seated at exactly 7p.  Not a big restaurant - it's one big room, high ceilings, with the bar at the center and tables around the edges and had a nice lively feel.    Draft list was on a chalkboard on the wall, and had some great seasonal and local selections.  Only special was the mussels of the day, which looked good but we're not mussels people.  Started with pate, which was an ample portion, and the seasonal salad, both hit the spot.  Lamb burger was good-sized and excellent.  Korean Reuben could have used a little more kimchi since it really did go well with the corn beef, but it was an interesting and enjoyable (and large) sandwich.  Couldn't even finish all the french fries served with each sandwich since we wanted dessert.  We went with gingerbread cake which was fresh and delicious but we couldn't help thinking it would have been better after 10 seconds in a microwave.  They brought it with a candle since we were celebrating my husband's birthday.  Service was professional and friendly and the server was helpful with beer and food selections.  We were happy with the prices we paid which were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of what we got.  We are partial to gastropubs in general and this was a very good one - would recommend to anyone to try.",

Really awesome cocktails, and you can tell that they don't skimp on ingredients or presentation.    Have been here twice for cocktails, and last night we added food.  Unfortunately the Manhattans made me lose my ability to recall what we ate at the bar.  Cute and friendly bartenders!  Highly recommend for night out on the town in Pittsburgh!",

She said pork but not beef so I expected only pork. I'm glad that beef was in it but it was too cooked. Also, I noticed that ingredients were missing like the fried egg. And where was the horseradish cheddar? The fries were also extremely salty. I'm bummed cuz I really wanted an awesome burger but I think a fast food joint burger would have been SO much better.",

Just try theirs. For brunch, get the Bloody Mary bar option. You will thank me.   Speaking of brunch I have ordered the short rib hash and poached eggs twice and I will order again. Ridiculous. $12. They could charge more and it would pay.   The wife bought the fried chicken and waffles. Also ridiculous. Chicken was moist and flavorful. Some would say spicy but tame for us. The real hero was the syrup. The bourbon, bacon infused syrup was so unique and flavorful it almost goes unnoticed in its small dish they serve it in.   Pork belly tacos are great!  The only item we ordered that didn't stack up to every other item was the lamb burger. It was good but compared to everything else they serve this was at the bottom of the list.",

You better call well in advance for those seats and have a res, and you'll be glad you did.  I've only ever been to M&P for brunch, but have been there several times. Each time I've ended up getting one of the specials as my meal, and I've never been disappointed, but have enjoyed some more than others. The cinnamon bun-fantastic and sticky! The Benedict special-it rotates and you should always get it!  Now for the drinks. The coffee is always hot and almost constantly refilled by their staff who are very attentive. Now there is also a magnificent Bloody Mary bar as well. This thing has everything and more that you could ever hope for your Bloody Mary--bacon, shrimp, celery, and...grape leaves!

Lol...She checked out the menu and said we have to go here!  We walked about 20 mins and arrived at the most divine place and walked in and were immediately seated!  The atmosphere was upbeat and lively and we got waited on by an incredible waiter Storm who proceeded to help us figure out what to order!  For me he told us if his favorite dishes- one was the Salmon and the other was the Pot Roast!  I chose the latter and I am so glad I did because it was the BEST pot roast I have ever had...mouthwatering and so tender!  The flavors and the seasoning and the sauce was out of this world!  Hannah got the New York Strip and it was cooked to perfection and was so tasty and so beautifully seasoned!  We also had the risotto for an appetizer and The Chocolate mousse for dessert!  Everything was Amazing!   I love this place and we even met the manager Josh who came and sat with us to share the history of the restaurant and the other places they own!  I am so Impressed and so excited to try there other places too!  Thank you for an incredibly awesome experience and the best food in Pittsburgh by far!",

We were packed into these tiny tables with half both seating and half char seating on a curve needless to say I could have grabbed a French friend off my neighboring tables plate without much effort.   But as for the food it was good! We had fried pigs ears which were spicy sweet and tasty. Along with fried pickles which were good but not great. I ordered the salmon. Which I actually loved. It's had a fried egg, black rice, kimchi, and hot sauce. I'd definitely order it again. My fiance got a pasta dish which he loved. And we finished with the baked French toast which was a bit disappointing but it sounded so good when described to us.   All in all not a bad experience by any means I would have just loved a bit more room and better fried pickles!",

Someone at our table got the chicken and waffles and it literally had almost a whole chicken on top - way too much food and really unnecessary although e said the flavor was good. I did think that the menu items were all very heavy so are a splurge - there was not a vegetable to be found on the menu. I also felt the chairs were too low for the table.

I've tried to get a reservation in the past and received similar responses to other reviewers. This time we made the reservation 2-3 months in advance so there was no problem. We had to make a 7:30 show and requested a 5:30 reservation so that our meal would not be rushed. We were told that a 6:00 would be plenty.   Yes, they got us out of there in time to put leftovers in the car and still get to the theater, but........Our meal didn't hit the table until 6:55. The steak and frites were great, but I didn't eat a lot of it b/c I didn't want all of the heavy food sitting in my stomach throughout the show. Given how late the food came out of the kitchen I also didn't want to inhale my meal and be even more uncomfortable. They probably would have made more money on us if we got the earlier reservation too. I definitely would have ordered more wine, some before dinner and some during. Dessert was not even an option.  The steak was really thick and delicious. However, there were so many flavors on the plate that it was a bit over the top. Either one of the sauces or the frites were extremely salty, which then just took over the flavor. My husband had the flat iron steak and loved it. The mushrooms and sauce were divine.   All of this being said, I would definitely go back but not on a night when I had to be somewhere else at a certain time.",

Overall, the food is decent (good quality but does not always hit the mark for taste). At dinner I would suggest the mussels (delicious). At lunch, avoid the fried pickles appetizer (not as good as the waitress suggested) and fried chicken sandwich. Do not order the brisket on flat bread at brunch (what was I thinking?).  Service is generally slow. On my most recent visit at brunch on Sunday at 1:30 (today) we waited 45 minutes for our food. On the other hand, the waitress was great about making sure my mug was always filled with coffee.  My last complaint is that the furniture is very  uncomfortable. It looks great but makes the legs sore. It's also too low for the height of the tables. The decor is nice.  Overall, M&P is a nice place to try, but I would certainly not call it one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. It does not live up to the hype.",

I ordered a drink while waiting for the order. The drink was really good. I got my food and went to the hotel 4min away from the restaurant. I had ordered bone marrow for an appetizer and hanger steak for a main. The bone marrow app was missing the bread that goes with it! And.. one of the marrows was undercooked :(  The hanger steak was ice cold and chewy. On top of that, they did not provide me with utensils!  I was very disappointed.",

I have to call out two of my favorite bartenders ever (of any place I've lived!), Blake and Mikey. The amount of awesome that they are is hard to describe. So I shan't. Just make sure you visit M&P some time on a weekday as they generally don't work weekends anymore and request a cocktail like the tequila old fashioned or the Honey Boo Boo.  Also, the kobe beef corn dog. Omg, that corn dog. Best. Corn dog. Ever.   The only reason I would consider not moving out of Pittsburgh (besides my boyfriend, of course ... ) is Meat & Potatoes. Now I'm sounding like the obsessive girlfriend, but damn y'all, the food is bombtastic.",

But if you do opt for any of their food involving meat & potatoes, you are in for a treat! On a snowy weekday night it was full but not busy around 9:00pm. I was able to seat immediately at the bar area which I'm sure I took the last available one. This place is not very large, nor is it good for big parties. 2-4 will probably be as big as this place can accommodate for the most part.  The bartender recommended the Wagyu Flat Iron which I got. Both the steak and potatoes were not dry and cooked to my liking. I also got the Root to Berry. It is a pretty fruity cocktail which is what I was craving as I waited for my food. I really wanted to try the bone marrow but all that food probably would have been too much just for me.",

Some dishes like chicken and waffles were massive and others like Korean burrito were really small with no sides included. The music was loud and the bass was thumping; i felt like we were in a bar or lounge and it was just not the vibe I was expecting for a Sunday morning. With tables very close to each other we weren't able to relax and chat - we did more leaning in and talking loudly (I'm in early 30s with no kids but I feel so old saying this!). Service was just okay. Getting attention or making requests a challenge - again i think because it was so busy.",

It seemed like everyone was raving about Meat & Potatoes, but we never seemed to get there for one reason or another. Finally, after buying tickets for a show I was able to get reservations for dinner pre-show.   The space itself is smaller than I expected, to the point that I actually felt a bit cramped.   The staff was incredibly friendly and it became clear that a few diners around us were regulars (one couple told us they lived in a condo nearby).   The alcohol selection was quite nice. I went with an old fashioned, my wife had wine.   Anytime I see duck on a menu I am tempted to order it. This was good, but nothing mind blowing. My wife ordered the Salmon which was, again, good but nothing incredible.  Again, I don't know if all of the hype made it impossible to meet expectations, but we both left the meal with the sentiment \"That was good, but not amazing.\"  I would be happy to go back and try again, but its not a high priority.",

That wood is then thrown on the fire to cook food. No thanks.",

    "text": "This was my third time here. My prior two experiences were very good. This third one was abysmal.  Came here for dinner with a group of coworkers and the wait staff was rude and un-attentive. Waitress disappeared for a good chunk of the night. Food came out way too late. All that needed to happen was just communication from our server. I totally understand when restaurants get busy, but a \"Hey guys sorry the kitchen is backed up, here's some fries to hold you over until your plates come out\" or SOMETHING would have sufficed.  When our meals finally came, three of my coworkers ordered the lamb and were very unhappy with how small the portion sizes were. I don't think any of us would go back again after that.  The DeShantz restaurants are declining a little bit. They have 6-7 restaurants open (or soon to be opening) and it doesn't seem that they have consistent quality staff they need to have behind each and every restaurant. Poulet Bleu is exceptional with their service and food....Tako is still very good. Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye seem to be the ones in the group that are slipping. A lot of reviews on here seem to cite poor service...shame. Get your FOH in order!",

    "text": "I would score this place 5 stars were it not for the half hour wait from being seated until getting a glass of water (warm), and then only after having to flag down a busboy (girl). It was like we were invisible. Other tables around us got attended so I guess our waitress was MIA. when she finally arrived and took our drink order it was another 15-20 minutes for them to arrive. I complained to the waitress and told her she'd better step up her game (tip inferred) and I'm happy to say she did!  After that the service was spot on! Nice recovery really. Anyway, when the food did arrive it was fantastic. I ordered 2 appetizers for the table, chicken wings and cauliflower. I would have been perfectly happy with the chicken wings for dinner they were so good! But I paced myself and fortunately stopped because when the double bone cooked to perfection 3\" pork chop arrived I had to finish it. I barely noticed what my wife had ( pot roast with mashed potatoes) or our nephew and niece's (both had the meatloaf. I was happy my wife didn't finish hers because I got to enjoy the leftovers the next day for lunch. To say that the portions were generous is an understatement. And the food was delicious. Btw, back to the waitress (server for those that insist on gender neutral pc), normally I tip at least 20%+ but it is not automatic. I'll tip more for exceptional service, suggestions, and hospitality, but i am also not adverse to leaving a lot less (rarely below 10% though). In this case I did feel that there should be a penalty, but in light of the nice comeback I decided on 15%. While she probably didn't realize it, because that's all many people tip anyway, I didn't want to reward being ignored when we arrived. Oh well, maybe next time I'll tip 25% if we get her again and she performs well.",

It is filling and yummy - a healthier option for there I would have to say.  I like the hanger steak, mussels, Salty Pig Flatbread, Brussel sprouts, mushroom risotto, etc...   I think their mussels are some of the best in town- an absolute must have.  And my hubby raves about the lunch burger (I cannot vouch for this though).  The Brussels are banging - you have to get those.   Even on off nights- they seem to have a vibrant bar scene.",

I hate how alot of smaller places like this have you cramed right up beside the next table, but at least staff here tried to space people out as best as they could.  Now for me it was over priced for anything other than a plain burger. So we both got burgers. I asked to have muchrooms added to mine since I had a choice of swiss cheese, and either the waiter is new or thats a strange request..since the waiter acted like it may be an issue, and they may not have them ( in my head I'm thinking this suposed to be a place of meat, what do you mean you may not be able to add mushrooms) but as an Avid mushroom lover it wasn't strange to me. After checking with the chef he said it was not a problem  ( was charged 2bucks for them) my burger and fries were cooked perfectly even though I asked for ranch on the side and was told they did not have it(what!). ALSO my burger meat seemed much smallert than the bun.  The food was enjoyable, it was a comfortable relaxed setting. However I do believe for us this was just a one-time try.",

Tonight I had dinner at the bar at Meat & Potatoes and asked for mayo & mustard for my burger. When I got my check I was charged a dollar for truffle mayo. I didn't ask for truffle mayo. When I mentioned it to the server he shrugged his shoulders. It's only a dollar, but I was disappointed with the lack of clarity. If you're going to charge me for mayo. Let me know so I can decide if I really want it. I'm in the industry and still over tipped. But I wanted to stiff him because of his reaction. I thought about talking to the manager, but again... it's only a buck. Still.. it's bad form. Is this your policy?",

The taters are actually just French fries, not tater tots if anyone was wondering. They were very good, but the sauce was too rich and garlic-y for my taste.  The sweet potatoes fries and the French fries that are served with the entrees were extremely salty and/or sweet. I would highly recommend replacing them with a salad or something else. My friends and I all agreed the sweet potato fries and French fries were subpar.  The pub burger was excellent, but almost too big to handle. 5 minutes in, my bottom bun of the burger became soggy and wet. The Cuban sandwich was good, but nothing special. The chicken and biscuits were great, and the pork chop was cooked very well with a lot of flavor.  I will definitely try to come back for dinner.",

    "text": "As soon as I knew I was traveling to Pittsburgh for work, I searched on my Yelp app restaurants and things to do near my hotel.  One of the places I bookmarked was Meat & Potatoes.  Talking to one of my Yelp friends, the night before I left on my trip, he recommended this same place so, now, of course, I must go.  I arrived in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday.  That night, I went straight to this restaurant.  I could see it was busy but, I only needed a table for one so I thought I would be able to get in.  Nope, it was 100% full and wait time was about 1.5 hours.  Good sign...  week day and this busy, must be really good.  So, again, using my Yelp app I made a reservation for Lunch the next day (should have done this from the very beginning...)    They opened at 11:30am, and my reservation was at 12:15pm.  I arrived right on time and was happy to see it wasn't crowded this time so, plenty of seats to choose from.  I sat right in front of the bar, where I could see the mixologist working her magic.  My server was great, friendly, always with a smile, and gave excellent recommendations.  I was between a pasta dish and the mussels.  Since it was lunch time, she said the pasta would be too heavy and I would definitely have leftovers (not practical when staying at a hotel) so I went with the mussels which I love, and can say they have one of the best dishes I've ever had.  It's an almost endless mountain of mussels in a coconut milk, lemongrass, curry broth, with cilantro and chili.  The chili is spread out through the mussels so you get the heat from it on some and it's absolutely delicious.  On top of that it comes with half a loaf of perfectly made garlic bread.  I'm not a fan of garlic but this, I could not resist, it is divine by itself and even better when dunked in the broth.  This dish is truly outstanding...  you can see for yourself, check out the picture I took and tell me your mouth is not watering immediately...  Other thing I love is trying signature drinks, especially when you see a bar like the one at Meat & Potatoes.  Equipped with every tool necessary for a mixologist (not a bartender), glasses of every type, herbs, bitters, fruits, you name it, they have it.  After looking through the \"Libations\" menu I went with the Vieux Carre - hennesy cognac / bulleit rye / cocchi vermouth di torino / benedictine / angosutra & peychaud.  My server described this as an \"in between a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned\".  They add one of those big blocks of ice to keep the drink cold and not watered down, and a lemon rind.  It's elegant, strong, but smooth and with a touch of sweetness, excellent for sipping and enjoy the beautiful bar.  They also have outside seating, which I'm sure would be very enjoyable on a beautiful day or night but, personally, after seeing the decor and bar inside, if I ever have the chance to go back, that's where I would like to be.  Where I can see those wonderful drinks be created and the amazing food is just steps away.  Regardless of what time you go, where you sit, or what you order, I assure you, one visit is all it takes to become a fan of this place.  To those living in the area...  lucky you!",

Seriously, I've never had such an extensive conversation over what to order, how to order it and at which pace everything should come out. It would have been overwhelming if it wasn't so much fun.   Meat & Potatoes is regarded as one of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's cool, it's funky, it's got a super-talented chef with an interesting menu full of culinary delights and treasures to choose from. I love that you can go either all small plates and share everything from mussels done one of three ways to a plate of delectably roasted Brussels sprouts with a few pork belly tacos thrown in in for good measure, or sit down to a proper three- or four-course meal with superb wine and service. The menu is flexible and fun, but the food is incredibly complex and refined without being stuffy, pretentious or over your head. It is meat and potatoes, after all.   I would highly recommend making a reservation well in advance, coming with a friend or a few, having one of their marvelous cocktails and then ordering a bunch of plates that appeal to you. Then I would do it all again a few nights later so you can have all the things you weren't able to stuff in your face that first night, because like I said, you'll likely want one of everything much like I did. And everything is soooooo goooooood.",

The waiter was kind enough to bring us the truffle mayo (that came with fries) upon request. $16-- Mussel - I love mussels but never had I had mussels with salmon roe, bacon, balsamic vinegar pearls & dill in a tomato sauce. As odd as this all sounds, it was fantastic.   Entrees (we all kind of shared) $19 -- Hudson Valley Duck Breast /pastrami crusted duck / sauerkraut pierogies /  scallion butter / dandelion greens / chimichurri ***This was my entree.  The CRUST on this duck is ridiculously DELICIOUS. The duck was perfectly cooked- tender, juicy...and so... mmm.  The pickled onions, dandelion greens & chimichurri complimented the richness of the duck well. I wasn't a big fan of the perogies (dumplings filled with potatoes & sauerkraut).  I took a few bites but it's just not my thing. Overall, good portion size and value.  Definitely would order this dish again.   $20-- Pork/smoked chop / pastrami / baked beans / spicy collard greens  ***My friend got this and it was HUGE! It must of been a double/triple cut pork chop.  Even had some folks from surrounding tables starring out of curiosity.  Usually when I think of pork chops, I think about dry and chewy. Not so the case here.  It  was moist and the sauce was really flavorful.  Spicy collard greens were good. ORDER THIS!  $29-- Wagyu Flat Iron / charred carrots / queso fresco / cilantro / pepita / radish / chili sherry vinaigrette  ***  My BF ordered this and it was probably my least favorite of the three entrees-- not to say it was bad.  The meat was cooked well, but it was a little on the plain side for me and it was the most expensive out of the three. I wouldn't order this.   Food is excellent, and the service was great. I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "We had no less than two people telling us this was the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, so it's a good thing it's on our way back to the hotel from the office. We stopped by at about 6pm on a Monday and was told the only tables they had were outside. We were totally OK with that, since Pittsburgh was a lot nicer than DC and the outside tables had cover over them.   We decided to get the bone marrow dish after reading so many yelp reviews, really having no idea what to expect. I've had bone marrow at home before, usually when my parents cook down huge bones for the soup base, but never at a restaurant. It's one of those things where I thought Americans don't usually eat. Anyway, the bone marrow came out with three huge bones where you can scoop out the marrow. It also came with four little toppings, pickled onion, capers, some kind of lime/cilantro mix, and another I can't remember. You use it as a spread on the toasted pieces of bread with the toppings. It was interesting. I'd say try it if you haven't, but I wouldn't order it again. It's quite heavy and fatty and oily, so you can't really eat that much, but definitely worth a try.   I ordered the lobster mac and cheese because I was planning on ordering the mussels and the waiter said the mussels had a pretty big portion, but I may still need something small on the side. Now the mac and cheese was heavenly! With a lot of lobster chunks in it! It's pretty much half lobster and half mac. So totally worth it. Then there was the mussels with the curry sauce. I can't resist mussels at a restaurant, especially when it's a curry sauce. I loved it! And it was a huge portion, even with all the shells! My coworker ordered the duck dish and it looked super good though. He really enjoyed it.   I'm so glad we got to try this place. I am kind of curious what the inside looks like. Maybe we'll get a chance to go back.",

Ordered the Waygu Flat Iron and portion sizes for my meal and other guests were incredibly small considering the prices. $12 Mac and cheese entree came with short ribs on it and was a larger portion than all of the entrees.   Food was extremely salty and not very flavorful.   Also, the restaurant is very small with tables so close surrounding the bar that you cannot pass somebody if you are coming or going and servers clog up the aisles. It is really more of a bar with some hgher-end, higher-prices bar/grill type items.",

I really felt like I benefited meal wise by sitting at the bar and not a table. I got to ask random questions about anything on the menu. I went with the steak tartare which was great but it had a lot going on. Brisket Mac n cheese was amazing and so filling. Just an app but it hit me like a brick. Great drinks, great food and a really sexy atmosphere. Parking was relatively easy too one street over (free after 6). Great place for a date or drink after work.",

    "text": "We went here for my fiance's birthday. I called ahead and she asked me if we were there for any special occasion. I told her yes, for a birthday, and asked if they do anything special. The girl on the phone laughed and said no, \"you have to pay for dessert\". I wasn't looking for free food, but was hoping for a special table, candle, etc. Otherwise, why did she bother to ask?  We got there and the waitress offered me a drink (my fiance was parking the car). She read me the draft beers and offered to come back to take a drink order. We were seated at a small, wobbly table for 2. It was so small, that it couldn't fit our entire order on it, and the waitress told us she had to \"map out\" how to deliver our food, so that it could all fit on the table.   Once my fiance was seated, we ordered the curry mussels. They were fantastic. I could almost drink the broth alone without the mussels.They were seasoned with red curry, what tasted like cilantro, and had a little bite to the aftertaste. We then ordered fried pickles (amazing breading, not too thick, and didn't fall off), devils on horseback (dates stuffed with sausage wrapped in bacon with a sweet red pepper sauce. Definitely more sweet than we imagined), and poutine (cheese curd was good on them).   My fiance decided on the lamb burger. It was delicious and juicy. It had a good lamb flavor and the bread was fresh and didn't tear. There was some sort of sauce on the burger, which was had good depth of flavor. It came with fries; the fries were fries. Nothing out of this world, but tasty.  I decided on the mushroom risotto. It was perfect. Flavors were delicious and the texture was creamy. It was a small plate and I was full, but not so full that I couldn't move, which usually happens when I eat here. It was a good portion size.  We weren't impressed with the desserts. We were looking for something light, and all they had was chocolate. The \"lightest\" thing they had, was some type of orange creamcicle dessert, and neither of us are fans. They change the desserts daily, so I was unable to order what I had last time I was there, and loved. To be honest, it was disappointing that we did not have dessert, given that we were there to celebrate a birthday. It would be nice if they had some type of standard dessert to accommodate several different pallets, that way everyone leaves happy.  All in all, it was great food, friendly service, and a good environment. Make sure to call ahead, though. They fill up fast, even during the week.",

    "text": "Met some friends from out of town and we were not disappointed.  Appetizer - Grilled Bread, Fried Pickles, and Wings.  Grilled Bread - served with freshly made preserve and butter - quite yummy to counteract the next appetizer.  Fried Pickles were approximately 1/2 inch thick.    The batter was thicker than I was used to at other establishments.   Very good to eat with my Porkslap Beer!  Wings were smoked (I honestly did not try).   My friends loved them and could not stop eating them before their entree came out.  I tried to the Pork (Fred Flinestone style) with baked beans and bacon served with a side of cole slaw.    The pork chop was approximately 2 inches thick and cooked perfectly.   The entire dish was awesome.  My friends ordered the Lamb Burger which received high marks.     Another ordered the Flank Steak which received a meh... due to seasoning.  Desert was followed by Rasberry - Oranged Cheese Cake and the ever decadent Chocolate Mousse Cake(?) Both were very good and a great contrast.   The only minus was the serving of the cheese cake (which seemed to be served in a shallow Jar.   It made it very hard for sharing.  If you want the experience but not the cost - sit at the bar.  Order a PBR for $3, split a flat bread or some wings (good portion) - You will have a good experience.    The bar is crowded but patience and PBR's go a long way :-)  Atmosphere - Crowded and Trendy.  Food - Very good - Cooked correctly.   I will be trying more of the appetizers and flatbreads in the future  Price - Snacks (Grilled Bread and Fried Picklets) - $5-$8 range, Appetizers - $12-16, Entrees $16-25 (average) besides the meal for two.  Enjoy!",

Also, my husband had dined at Tako, a restaurant by the same restaurant group and loved it there. Positives include a great bar area, which is where we sat. The bartender, Jenna was so friendly and helpful. We also chatted with some really friendly people at the bar... Pittsburgh has some of the nicest people! Anyways, we had fried chicken livers for an appetizer. They're were very large and it was a huge portion, like everything else here. It was just too much and the taste was just okay. We ordered the giant ribeye to share. It was enormous. Again, the taste was just okay. Giant cuts of meat sound fun and look cool but it's very difficult to cook them right and to get a great flavor and texture out of them. There's nothing wrong with any of the food, just not to my liking. I do think it's worth a shot to visit to see what it's all about.",

We were there on a Monday night, 8/28/2017,  and the place was packed.   This place is definitely overrated.  First we ordered two appetizers, the Bone Marrow and the Wild Mushroom Risotto. The Bone Marrow was terrible. It was nothing but fat and grease. They provide bread with the marrow that is grilled but it was actually burnt and had a definite burnt taste. We asked for more bread and were told there would be a $3 charge but we didn't mind that at all. The bread again was burnt and had that burnt flavor. The Wild Mushroom Risotto on the other hand, was delicious.  In my party we ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron steak, the Lamb meatballs with pasta, the Spring Chicken, and Salmon.   The Wagyu Flat Iron steak was good but nothing to write home about. I have had better.  The Lamb Meatballs were good but the pasta that came with them was overcooked and rubbery.  The Spring Chicken was just okay and it was on the dry side. We have made juicier chicken at home.  The salmon was terrible. It was the worst tasting salmon we have ever had. It came with black rice that definitely had a different taste that nobody liked. The salmon had a fried egg on it too which seemed strange and didn't really pair well with the salmon.   In my party we ordered two specialty beers they had on tap, the Redstone Watermelon Nectar and the Greenflash Divine Sauvage. They were both excellent beers.  The service was excellent but the food was sub-par. You can get a better steak at Outback than what we had. Don't go here it is over priced and over hyped. Don't waste your money.",

The establishment is fancy enough but weirdly integrated in the building that it inhabits, which causes some issues with their welcoming of patrons, their restroom location and their general state of apparent confusing entrance.  The smell of alcohol (although quality one from what I can see) is pungent to the point of annoyance, and speaks to a questionable ventilation. The decor is fancy without being overstated, yet the place is a little crowded creating a packed atmosphere that detracts from the elegant dining ambiance. The food itself is equally divided between uninspiring (their staple truffled potatoes and their burgers) to the good but incredibly pricey(the tartare was literally a couple of spoons for 14$ or so, although I must give them props for the very well put together presentation). The (almost) saving grace was the Flatbread, reasonably priced, sizeable if not generous, and cleverly balancing the fat of the charcuterie with the crispy dryness of the base. Thumbs up for our attentive server, who was informative and fast to refill our drinks.",

Had it with the white truffle butter, which was a good touch, but not necessary. The truffle fries are above average; as a note I'm  usually not wild about truffle fries as they're somewhat over played and underwhelming.  Service was good too, cocktails were all well made and garnished. The wine options offer good variety.",

It is AMAZING and a bargain at $59 as we ate off of it for days!!  Our daughter had the Plain Jane burger with white cheddar cheese and loved it.   I'm glad I made reservations as the place was packed the whole time we were there.  Service was exceptional as our waitress Ashlee S was great and took good care of us.

We took advantage of the Bloody Mary bar- I had bacon vodka (the only non-spicy option), while my husband had the honey Sriracha. The bar itself was great! I love mine a little dirty & was disappointed to not find olive juice on the bar. Fun experience & there were plenty of items you could probably make 2-3 skewers if you put everything on! Onto the food. I asked the server if the eggs in purgatory was in a tomato ragu (I saw a mushroom ragu on the menu too) and he said \"no, it's mushroom.\" Based on his response I ordered that. To my surprise, it came out as a tomato sauce. Had I known (why I asked), I would've ordered something else. Very disappointed, and the reason for 3 stars. To have a server not know the ingredients in your regular menu items (it'd be better to say \"not sure, let me check\") is unacceptable.  The dish was fine, just not what I expected. My husband had the chicken & waffle- huge portion but the bones in chicken always make it tough to eat. He enjoyed the subtle spice from the jalapenos (he says 3.5 stars). I was very excited about this place with the high rating & countless reviews, but am disappointed.",

    "text": "I was visiting my sister from out-of-town and she HAD to bring me to this place for our night out together. Overall, we had a great visit but our service for most of the evening severely lacked which is why I am deducting one star!   Our reservation was at 6:45pm and we arrived a little early at 6:30pm, so while we waited for a table, we sat at the bar to order some drinks. We got delivered a menu and patiently waited for the entire 15 minutes to be acknowledged by someone behind the bar. I tried to understand since they were busy. But, there were 4 bartenders behind the bar and 2 out of 4 of them were hand-washing cups. We felt awkward not being acknowledged by anyone, so this started our evening off a little sour.   We did get our table as promised by 6:45pm and waited around for our server to show up and take our orders. Meanwhile all tables around us are being acknowledged and served. Eventually after a few minutes of sitting, our waiter did come over to our table to take our drink and food orders. We started off with some mussels. These mussels were amazing. The only complaint I had was I wanted MORE!!! They were ridiculously flavorful and just downright amazing (I highly recommend the curry mussels). We ordered some pate too, it was pretty good - but I would recommend mussels for sure!!  Next on to our entrees; my sister ordered the duck and I ordered the steak; extremely flavorful, delicious food. On another level - that is for sure! I absolutely couldn't get over the amount of flavors inside of my dish, it was some of the best I've ever tasted. Again, the food was absolutely tremendous. However, it was extremely frustrating to watch out for our waiter who was serving tables around us, but did not come back to ours. He went back to other tables most of the night to refill beverages but for some reason; he didn't even come over to ours. We had to flag him down to get another alcoholic beverage. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the service and my sister (who visits this place often) stated that the service has NEVER been that way, and usually most of the servers are very proactive. I was pretty disappointed as it did cause a slight damper, but overall the food was pretty damn amazing. I would definitely return but I would hope to have way better service in the restaurant and at the bar.",

I'm so happy my Uber driver suggested this place and I was able to convince my group to travel away from campus to try and validate the yumminess.  Now for the bad the hostess/host stand and seating process is a joke. We came on a Wednesday right before noon and visually saw empty tables but we had to wait in line to tell the hostess we would like a table for two ppl. Either the gal at the stand wasn't familiar with the system or she is forced (let's hope forced) to fill-in fields (she asked for our name and phone #) and she actually had to print out a small ticket to give to the guy that took us to our table. WTF!?!?!? It took a while and again, we could see the empty tables.  We finally were seated at a tiny table inside. We had luggage so this was not ideal. The waiter was prompt but asked us for our beverage order yet we had no drink menus to select from (small mistake and very forgivable).   I would definitely come back when I visit Pittsburgh again however perhaps I'll make a reservation, naaaahh, I don't think that will help that seating process.",

A huge bowl was served and I think I was pretty full after that app.    The main course was scrumdidilyumtious. Sorry, it was a word from willy wonka but I had a quagmire moment as well in my own head.    I ordered the pot roast which was server in a Le Creuset mini kettle with lid.  This was served with delicious veggies and mashed potatoes. The gravy was phenomenal.  This was a serious dish and I complemented it with a Sgt Peppers Old Fashioned. The drink was excellent.

When someone comes in for lunch, and there are 40 minutes left, don't tell them, \"we have to be respectful of our servers than need to leave at 2.\"  Maybe, I don't know, you as an employee should be more respectful of your owner's business.  And, no, we don't want to eat at the bar on a limited menu.  Company owners try so hard to establish a good business and it only takes one rude, poorly trained employee to ruin the experience and cause a poor review to be written.",

He made a reservation, told them it was my birthday and asked if they did anything special for birthday, the gentleman said 'yes of course we do'. Got there ten minutes early, the hostess did not even mention anything about it being my birthday, and sat us immediately (into a sardine can). The people on each side were about two feet from us.    Food: We got a 'snack' - the toast with goat butter and jam- very tasty and reasonable priced. Then we ordered the \"meat and potatoes for two\". The steak fries, bone marrow, and mushrooms were really good, but the steak was 70% fat, it was $50 for the steak. For $50 it should have been a lean cut of meat. We cut close 50% of it off because of all the fat. *All of the food took a while to come out but that is to be expected when you are paying a lot for a meal.  We asked for a box and the check and our waitress came back with a box, then she final recognized that it was my birthday by saying 'oh you aren't interested in a birthday dessert?' We declined. She did not even wish me a happy birthday or even wish me a wonderful night, just okay I'll get your check.   They have a lot of interesting foods on the menu so I might go back again. But I would never go back if celebrating a special event. Terrible ambiance, too noisy, it's not romantic, did nothing to make me feel 'special' on my birthday. (I'd recommend Morton's on Liberty for that).",

I've also tried the brunch which is, after Tamari's amazing new Sunday brunch, one of the best in the city (don't forget to save room for the all you can drink Bloody Mary bar).   I would have given them 5 stars, but I actually don't really love the ambiance. M&P gets a lot of the downtown pre-theater crowd and it always feels a bit too full.

Both dinners were after a show across the street, around 10:30pm. Sat outside with show mates and had a bit of everything-pappardelle pasta with short rib, Brussels sprouts, bone marrow (ridiculously huge portion for what you pay--ask for extra bread with it), fried pickles, the salty flatbread-just a lot of food. Everything was incredibly good, and not over seasoned. Came back on another beautiful night for a repeat of the pasta sitting at the bar-- my best meal of all. Drinks were stellar--including this bourbon/balsamic/basil treat that I repeated both nights. Brunch was also incredible. Chicken and waffles can easily be split--basically a half chicken worth of poultry on a big waffle. Chicken is different from other fried chicken--almost double fried, and tasty enough to eat the skin by itself--really memorable. I've had a lot of gastropub/contemporary american meals on the road this year, and this place, for many reasons, is by far the most memorable of the bunch.",

We spent about two hours, slowly working through apps and beer then lunch/dinner.  The pretzels were good, the beer cheese made them great.  The brats were wonderful.  The red cabbage was a surprise hit as well.  I tried the beer in a flight to try each, but went back for more of the dunkel and hefeweizen.  The dunkel was a real treat.  I recommend to plan to spend a good amount of time here.  Also, very kid friendly.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will try again.",

    "text": "Amazing gastropub in downtown Pittsburgh.  We've been here for after-dinner drinks and snacks, but most recently had the opportunity to check out their brunch, which they have on Saturdays and Sundays.  On a recent Sunday we tried to call ahead for reservations but were informed that they were completely booked.  However, we discovered that if you don't mind sitting at the bar, you can show up for brunch and walk right in.  We got there right at 10:30 and we had no problems.    Great atmosphere: exposed brick with a marble-top bar and old-school fixtures and weird antler-type chandeliers and things hanging on the walls, and a lot of mirrors and chalkboards where specials are written on the wall.   They had many brunch specials, but we went with the Irish Benedict and the Huevos Ranchero.  The Irish Benedict had an amazing hollandaise sauce over poached eggs, corned beef, cheese and some yummy thick toast.  The Huevos Ranchero were also amazing, with a delicious tomato-chili sauce, picked onions, and black beans.    Both meals were so large that we couldn't finish them.  I also ordered the potato gratin on the side, but it was sort of meh in comparison to everything else.    And the brunch cocktails were delicious: the papaya bellini was great, but the French 76 was amazing.   They have an extensive bloody mary bar which we didn't get, but it looked really fun, with all these self-serve fixins like tons of different types of olives, asparagus, artichoke, etc. etc.  Overall, great service, great atmosphere, fantastic food.  We'll be back for more Meat & Potatoes!",

Tasted everything at the table, which ranged from Roasted Branzino, to Risotto to the Pub Burger.  For a Meat & Potato place, they did fish (Branzino) and risotto some of the best I have ever had.  The Pub Burger was nothing short of amazing.  Loved it.  Maybe death row last meal good.  Decent selection of beers, nothing to write home about but a few good small craft choices.  Good bar and good place for drinks and snacks as well as a meal.  The service is a different story.  Our server, Emily, I think we were actually bothering her to be there.  Seemed not to want to work or take care of customers.  Also, we asked her what Devil of Horseback was (a small plate).  She described it wonderfully and the four of us all oohed and aahed.  She neglected to tell us only 3 came on the plate.  She could have told us and offered to add a fourth or tell us to get two.  She seemed experienced just full of attitude.  Based on some other reviews, may be a common theme so be forewarned.  Overall small place but really good food with under attentive staff.",

Their chicken and waffles doesn't sound that different than something you could get almost anywhere, but the chicken is really seasoned well and there is some jalapeno in the waffles. And the French toast is also very good. Love the almond brittle they give with it as it really gives the texture of the French toast a little something different.

She picked Meat and Potatoes and I have heard of it so I was pleased to give it a try. Today, I live in the Phoenix area where a food revival has been occurring for the last decade. This prohibition themed area is comfortable and bright. The mixologists at the bar have an array of magic at their fingertips. We asked for a specialty martini for Mom that was tasty and not too strong. He whipped up a raspberry citrusy take on the cosmopolitan for her that was bright and sweet and pink and delicious. I opted for my classic Belvedere martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Mom chose the duck breast and I had the lamb neck cassoulet. Both were extraordinary and huge! Luckily we chose not to have an appetizer so we filled ourselves and sipped a delish pinot noir from our friendly server Adam. The atmosphere is light with 1970s pop music playing of Elton John, Billy Joel and James Taylor and diners were businessmen, families with kids, theater goers and young people. I recommend this meaty, comfortable take on amazing food without any reservations.",

The menu is full of highlights. Everything is delicious! I am in particular a fan of the brussels sprouts and poutine on the snack menu, the tartare on the appetizer menu, and pretty much all the entrees.

Now the food.  Shad roe appetizer and tuna tartare appetizer were both perfect. I had the mussels with coconut lemongrass sauce which surpassed my prior favorite at Pointe Brugge by a mile.  Plus M&P grills their bread, which makes for better sauce dipping.  My guest had a steak, and said it was \"better than Capital Grille.\"  Finally, the frites with truffle mayo and the fried Brussels sprouts were both phenomenal sides.

    "text": "I have come to understand that the term \"gastropub\" really means \"great bar, so-so ambiance, middling food.\" Unfortunately, Meat & Potatoes is a prime example of this.  Hubby and I decided to try this place since it was new and we've pretty much been to all the other Cultural District restaurants, plus we wanted to experience the successor to Cafe Zao (which was one of our very favorites).  While the service and cocktails were good, we were underwhelmed with the food and ambiance of the place.   First of all, I was disappointed to find only two steaks on the menu of a place named \"Meat & Potatoes.\" One steak was a fattier cut and was moderately priced; the other one was over $40 - deal breaker! I settled for one of the evening's specials, a fish-and-chips platter that came out looking and tasting like something you'd get at a fairground or at a greasy spoon kind of joint.  The cocktail menu is really interesting - I tried a few old-timey drinks I'd never had before and was really pleased. But the problem with having a great bar in an upscale restaurant is that when the bar is a U-shape in the middle of the dining room, you get patrons lining up three-deep all around it to have their drinks. We were seated so that my husband had his back to the window and I had my back to the bar. Through the entire meal, other patrons were standing immediately behind my chair, leaving no space for the servers to pass through from the kitchen without squeezing between us. All evening, hot plates of food were passed over my head and someone's butt kept bumping my chair. We mentioned the problem to the manager, but he basically said he couldn't do anything. I think it would have been better for the new owners of the place to change the layout a bit since Cafe Zao did not use the bar in the same way that Meat & Potatoes obviously is.",

Fortunately, the dish was succulent and despite my better judgement I finished all of the huge platter of 2 poached eggs and corned beef, although I did leave much of the hollandaise sauce as it was too much.  The wait staff were attentive and I was able to try a number of microbrew Stouts with the Irish eggs benedict (these went together quite well) as my glass never was quite finished before they asked if I wanted another.

    "text": "Love it. My friend and I came on weekday evening and were welcomed very sweetly by the hostesses. The food along with the prices are pretty straight forward. We went for a bunch of snacks and one appetizer to split. We had the mac n cheese (amazingly decadent and would definitely order again), poutine (fries were a bit burnt BUT anything tastes good when it's smothered in gravy), bone marrow (largest portion I've come by), mussels in their beer sauce (huge portions and it's a MUST), and their soft shell crab tacos ( we could've done without this, it was way too sweet for my liking).     The staff was really helpful and pleasant and the ambiance was romantic minus the view. We sat outside on the patio and it would've been perfect except for the view of people waiting for the bus and the traffic line up. Not so romantic haha. If they could just put a nice wall of green shrubbery/bamboo to block that out, it would do wonders to the place.",

    "text": "If there was one place I wanted to try in Pittsburgh, it was Meat & Potatoes. As Pittsburgh's first gastropub, Chef Richard DeShantz knocked it out of the park by featuring a veritable montage of some of my favorite foods. And since the 2011 opening of Meat & Potatoes, he's taken over the Downtown Pittsburgh scene by opening up Butcher & the Rye and Tako, in addition to his bistro, Nine on Nine.  Meat & Potatoes features a bustling, yet cozy space with a central bar as the focal point. The GF and I met up with some friends and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our reservation. After waiting an extra 10 or 15 minutes past our time, we were graciously offered a private dining room. But as we were about to head to our table, a perfect table for 4 by the corner opened up so we could enjoy the animated atmosphere.  Cameron's Kick [$10] Chivas Regal 12 year scotch, Irishman whiskey, orgeat, lemon, nutmeg  I started off the night with the Cameron's Kick, which featured smooth Chivas Regal and the kick of Irishman whiskey. The orgeat syrup imparted nice undertones to complement the scotch and in combination with the lemon and nutmeg, this was a surprisingly light and subtly sweet tipple.  Fried Pickles [$5] Spicy ranch  For our meal proper, we began with the fried pickles, which were spot on. A pet peeve of mine is when fried pickles come in spear form. Clearly, they're meant to be in chip form. These had a great crunch and a nice brininess that was accented by the spicy ranch.  Kobe Corn Dog [$7] Wasabi aioli, spicy ketchup, radish, sesame seeds  The kobe corn dog had a nice cornmeal crust that had a sweetness that was balanced by the richness of the beef dog. The light crunch of radish added some levity, with the wasabi aioli providing some spice. The ketchup had just the right amount of kick to provide some brightness to each bite as well.  Braised Pork Belly [$18] Carrots, English peas, pork jus, baby turnips, pea tendrils  On special for the day was the braised pork belly. So obviously, this was a must order and I'm so glad I did. The pork was unctuous, well-braised, and had a nice final crisp to provide some texture. Three huge hunks provided triple the pleasure. But not to be outdone, the English peas and gorgeous carrots had a wonderful sweetness that provided that countervailing element to balance out the heft of the pork belly. The baby turnips provided some starch and additional texture, with the pea tendrils adding an herbaceous element to each bite. This isn't just meat and potatoes people. Pittsburgh can cook!  Meat & Potatoes for Two [$59] 34 oz ribeye, confit steak fries, mushroom ragu, housemade steak sauce, bone marrow gratin   But the main reason I was here? Behold the hallmark dish - meat and potatoes for two. A huge 34 ounce long-bone ribeye is featured, though I'm fairly certain there was more than 34 ounces of beef on this particular night. Though I could have used a bit more of a salt-seasoned crust, it was cooked perfectly medium-rare. And more importantly, the beef cut and ate like filet. In fact, I don't remember the last time I had ribeye so tender. This was all topped by a mushroom ragu that provided earthy heft to each bite. The gratin provided wonderful texture to the fatty bits of marrow - easily a cup's worth of God's butter. The confit potatoes were perfect - a light crunch on the outside with creamy tenderness within. Perfect to dip with either the spicy ketchup or the housemade steak sauce. This dish can easily be shared by 4. Safe to say, there were leftovers, even for me.  Lobster Mac n Cheese [$16]  Taleggio, white cheddar, Doritos, truffle  You don't think I stopped there did you? I had to get the lobster mac, which featured the delicious combo of taleggio, white cheddar, black truffles, and yes, Doritos. The cavatappi was al dente and had great bite. The cheese sauce was a bit soupier than I typically like, but the earthiness of the truffle and the salty of the Doritos definitely came through.  Lemon Berry Pie [$7]  And since we were celebrating the GF's birthday weekend, we had to end with some dessert. The lemon berry pie was layered in a mason jar. Light, sweet, tart, and tangy, it was the perfect palate cleaner.  It's safe to say that Meat & Potatoes is a must if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Service was helpful and on top of things, despite it being a busy night as well. Not only are the dishes well-executed and delicious, I also couldn't believe the price point of the meal. It's not to say the meal was cheap and I'm sure there's the element of cost of living when compared to Philly or NYC, but I would have gladly paid more. The next time I'm in town, I know I'll need to check out Butcher & the Rye and Tako. But I know a part of me that will feel the urge to simply return to Meat & Potatoes.",

Meat and Potatoes is not quite as down-home as it sounds. Pate and bruschetta are on the Sunday brunch menu. Michelle's Bellini was made with real strawberries, and my Bloody Mary bar was a DIY festival with six kinds of meat, probably two dozen pickled things in jars and just as many varieties of hot sauce.   And yet, if there are two kinds of good menus--inventive deliciousness and calculated deliciousness--this definitely was the latter. Maybe it was the decor: I just can't take antlers seriously in a new downtown cultural center. Maybe it was needing to decide between chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, huevos rancheros AND stuffed French toast.   I ended up with E: None of the Above, but it was hard to know if I was eating brisket hash or a marketing gimmick.",

Sunday around 4pm still resulted in a 30 minute wait.   MODERN RUSTIC VIBE With canning jars at the entrance, the flickering of 'chandeliers', as well as dark furnishings--Meat & Potatoes delivers a poshy yet rustic vibe that still fits well with this area of the 'Burgh. The outside seating is also a great place to people watch yet still tucked under the building's roof.  GET READY FOR SOME FOOD CREATIVITY The appetizers already set the mood for the ride ahead. The Strip Tartare arrived with a smoked Egg--gooey, runny Yolk--the Tartare being soft and well-seasoned against the milder crunchy Bread. Their Brisket Mac & Cheese was an explosion of comfort food but kicked up with hints of Horseradish and Potato Chips. I was also surprised at their Ceasar Salad--loaded with Cheese but enhanced with a sunny Egg on top. And yes... besides combining flavors I often don't see elsewhere (yet make sense) the food tasted great!",

    "text": "Read the recent reviews! If you do, you'll see that the overlying theme of many of the reviews is their poor service. This is also the reason why I'm giving them two stars. Service is just not good. For real.   This used to be my absolute favorite restaurant here in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere was great, the food was on par, and drinks were amazing. Over time though, their service has gone downhill so much, that I really don't have any desire to come back. I've actually left feeling embarrassed for taking out of town guests here, it's been so bad. Before I go on about service though, I want to say that their food has also changed over the years, and it's just, well........it's just not as good anymore. Gah, I hate saying that out loud. I really do. I want to like it still. But I've given Meat and Potatoes too many chances over the past year, and each time I've left sorely disappointed.   The real reason I'm writing this review is to share my frustrations with their lack of service. From the hostesses to the waiters, they are just not good. Sometimes they are not friendly, sometimes they're downright snooty and condescending, or heck, sometimes we don't get service at all and have to wait there for obscene amounts of time before someone actually comes by our table. Now you may wonder why I just don't speak up and say something, but I'm not a confrontational type of person. I'd rather just hurry up and get the heck out of there. Unfortunately, I always have this moment between visits where I think on the good old days when things were great there and decide to give them another chance. But, I guess the joke is on me. No more.   Whew, glad I got that off my chest. And clearly, I'm not the only one bothered by their lack of service. I guess you could take your chances and maybe get a diamond in the rough as your waiter, or you could spare yourself the likely possibility of getting a dud and go somewhere else. Either way, you've been warned.",

The bar was full and so was the restaurant on a Sunday night before the Pirate Dodger game, with many in team colors for both teams.  Some nice up beat music playing.   Service was on point.  We shared the Cobb salad that had bacon lardons, tomatoes, egg, scallions, some great blue cheese and a avocado ranch dressing.  A great start to our dinner.  For a appetizer we ordered the Lobster Mac that has some black truffle.  The mac was good, especially when you had a chunk of the lobster or truffle. Two people in our group split the Meat & Potatoes for Two (34 oz. ribeye, confit stay fries, mushroom argue and bone marrow gratin.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The bone marrow was perfect sweet combination.  The confit potatoes were very good with a nice crunch and flavor.  The Pork Chop, ordered by someone at our table, looked great and was told it was top notch.",

I would much rather trade their huge portions for better quality food and preparation. I had the brussels which weren't crunchy. My pork was super thick and very difficult to cut. My father had the cassoulet and thought it was too salty.   Bone marrow was good, but they serve it with all types of toppings to conceal the fact that the bone marrow isn't very tasty without them!   Again, I'm not super aware of the options in Pittsburgh, since I no longer live here, but my guess is that you can find better. This place isn't as good as it used to be.",

Multiple times, a server would stop and ask how our meal was and if our drinks were ok.    Our meal was served quickly even though the place was packed.  The drinks were of upscale quality.   Cons: The place was at max capacity and the tables are so close you end up hearing the next tables conversation.  They in turn hear yours and can lead to them chiming in on your conversation.   We ordered the 45oz steak for 2 people.  I do not recommend getting this as it is only a novelty item. The steak was 35% fat and was of poor quality.  We would have been better off ordering individual steaks which would have been much better.",

There was bone marrow was included but no bread? but bread is included in the appetizer to the couple next to us.    When the waitress came by to ask how the meal was we told her that more than half of this was inedible. She said oh would you like desert?

The first time I went there, it was Pgh Restaurant Week and they offered a 5 course tasting menu. It was the first time I'd ever had marrow. And if you are thinking, \"Ew! Marrow??\" Believe me. I was the same...until I ate it. And it was delicious.  Everything else we ate that night was also delicious. Fried chicken and jalapeno waffles. Sweetbread tacos. Grilled bread w/ goat butter and rhubarb jam....  Sweet baby J. Can I tell you about that grilled bread??  GET IT.  It is offered as an app at brunch AND dinner, so no matter what time of day you are there, you can get it and you should. It's probably what God eats for breakfast.  Spare rib hash for brunch? DO IT.  So basically what I am saying is...The food is great. The service is also great - every time I've called to make a reservation (and I'm always last-minute b/c I'm a procrastinator), they've gone out of their way to fit us in.

We reserved with OpenTable through Yelp for an 8:15pm seating on a Thursday, so although we arrived about 30 mins early, we were seated within 15 minutes. i would recommend doing the same, as the other yelpers seem to have long waits otherwise...  Drinks--creative and delicious (my choice: Moscow Mule in its own self-titled copper mug)  Food--also inspired. i loved the devils on horseback and could've eaten another two orders on my own. Mussles tasted fresh and well-seasoned. the pasta i ordered was a bit undercooked, but the 3-meat sauce it came in more than made up for that shortcoming. charcuterie board was delish and enough to satisfy, but not fill 2 people up before their meal.  Service--attentive but busy  Vibe--industrial, cool, funky; great for an intimate group of friends or a date.  Can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh one day and return...  Walk to nearby Andy's at the Fairmont hotel for a nightcap, and enjoy the fab jazz trio and sophisticated atmosphere :)",

    "text": "I'm disappointed in the service and the kitchen at Meat & Potatoes.   First, I usually expect my server to know what the daily specials are, but our server read the brunch menu off of a handwritten list that she was carrying around. When it was time for dessert, she again read from her list. It appeared that she either missed one of the desserts or the kitchen had run out (we saw the table next to us order a dessert that wasn't offered to us).  Second, I was unhappy with the wait time. We waited quite a while for a table, though this was probably largely our fault for not reserving a table for Sunday brunch. But then on top of that, we waited far too long for our food after we ordered. We waited at least half an hour for our food to come in this crowded, noisy restaurant. Our server never stopped by our table to tell us what was going on with our order but let us sit and talk amongst ourselves about how long we were waiting for our meal. I'm not sure what was going on in the kitchen, but we waited over half an hour for our food. The restaurant was busy, but surely not any busier than any other Sunday brunch period. We ordered straight off the menu, so there was no excuse for the delay.   I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which was fairly good. There wasn't too much cheese on my sandwich, which I took to be intentional. In fact, I was talking about how some restaurants put too much cheese on their sandwiches, thus crowding out out the deliciousness of the fresh bread! Then my chef husband pointed out where the cheese had run off the sandwich and melted onto the grill while being overcooked. The cheese had been cooked right out of my sandwich.  My husband ordered the brisket flat bread and was disappointed. He thought it tasted charred (\"dirty oven taste\") and underseasoned. Our other dining companion ordered the short rib hash. She said it was delicious, but she couldn't eat the bottom layer of potatoes in the dish because they were sitting in a puddle of grease.   There were a few other things on the menu that I was thinking I'd try next time, but after today's experience, I probably won't go back.",

    "text": "I came here in March one Sun. morning, after hearing the hype about the brunch.  While I'm always curious to try much-hyped restaurants, I'm always a bit skeptical--I guess this comes from being afraid that I'll be disappointed.  My dining companion, who'd been here several times with other people, had been wanting to come with me, but I was never able to get a reservation (I've heard you have to reserve weeks ahead, which is testament to just how popular brunch is here).  However, he informed me that he'd always sat at the bar, which doesn't require a reservation, so we decided to try for that.  We arrived at about 11am, and, after about a half hour wait, we were seated.  I was torn over whether to try the bloody Mary bar, which many other reviewers recommended, or a brunchtail, recommended by my dining companion.  Between wanting to save room for food and the cocktail of the day (I forget exactly what it was, but it had rhubarb, which I love), I opted for the hair of the dog, which turned out to be an excellent choice--indeed, so excellent that when the bartender asked if I wanted another, I assented enthusiastically, which I never do, since I try to be conscious of my alcohol intake.  For my entree, I ordered the chicken and waffles, per reviewer recommendations, even though I was a bit skeptical since I don't really care for jalapeno.  I had never tried this dish before, but I've had it since (in Atlanta, no less), so I have a standard for comparison.  While I always hesitate to use this much-cliched word, it was--epic!  The bourbon maple syrup was sweet, but not overly so, and it complemented the savoriness of the waffle (in which I couldn't taste any jalapeno at all) perfectly.  I took the chicken off of the waffle and poured the syrup directly on it in order to ensure that as much of it covered the waffle as possible, and then replaced the chicken.  The chicken was delightfully crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside--some of the best fried chicken I've had in PGH.  Since I couldn't hope to eat the whole thing in one sitting (it's huge!), I ate the waffle and half the chicken, and took half the chicken home (it was still great the next day!).   After eating the waffle, I felt so full, there was no need for another meal until 5pm.  The atmosphere is great--very trendy and bright, and there's a DJ spinning tunes on Sun. mornings.  The bartenders, who served us, were attentive and helpful.  While I initially doubted I'd come out saying this, I can confidently say that M&P brunch is worth the hype.  Try it--you won't be disappointed!",

I also saw short ribs on other items, would have liked to see a short rib entree)...I am having a hard time deciding on 4 or 5 stars....I think it is really close to 5, but a couple small things, like the drink, the pastrami (see below) and a friend saying the steak was a ittle tough are making me  go 4 instead of 5. But honestly, this was probably the best sit down meal I had all week in this town and wouldnt hesitate to suggest you try it.  We had a group of 8, so we started with a bunch of the small plates, or whatever they call them. The Fried Pickles...oh my....I am not a huge fried pickle person, but if everywhere that has them made them like this, I would be. Best. Fried. Pickles. Ever! The Poutine...being from the west coast, I had no idea what this was. But I am now a fan. Very tasty. The grilled bread...meh...it was fine, but not exciting to me, but a buddy with me said it was his favorite.  The Brussel were also very tasty. Im not usually a Brussel guy, but it was outstanding. I wanted to love the corn dog....it was good, dont get me wrong, but it just wasnt as exciting as I was hoping for. It was solid though.  The bone marrow....wow...what can I say? It was extravagant, decadent, rich, buttery goodness. And my buddy that lives in town said his dog loved the bones...  Soooo...I had the pork chop....holy crap was that thing huge! It was very moist and tender with a nice smoky flavor. The apple salw had a nice little kick to it, and the cool spicy crunch of the slaw with the tender smokey-ness of the pork and the sweetness of the beans was a great combo. The only thing I felt that came up short was the pastrami. It was just this really fatty piece of limp meat that didnt have much contributing in the flavor dept and wasnt the best texture, to me. Overall, the dish was a big win though.   I really enjoyed this place and would like to give it a 4.5....if you are looking at yelp trying to decide where to go in Pittsburgh, this is the place...I just wished I had more time there to try more of their menu (like lunch...the sandwiches and burgers sounded great). I think it is really close to 5 stars, it was just a couple really small things that cant let me do it (btw- I hate when people give good reviews, but not 5 stars and dont explain why)",

For brunch, for dinner, to sit at the bar.  Let's start with brunch...4.3 stars.  Their brunch menu is excellent if you are a foodie.  They have a lot of tasty and creative items.  Yes, they are a little fancier then my taste but they taste good.  Their dinner menu is just ok.  maybe 3.1 stars.  We went here once after a pirates game and they placed us in what could be compared as a home office.  The room felt so small.  I felt clausterfobic the entire time.   The food was just ok too.  Go somewhere else for dinner!!!",

The meat was moist and flavorful.  The egg was also a tasty addition.  I enjoyed the thick cuts of bread, which were grilled.  Probably top five sandwiches I have eaten anywhere.  Thick. tasty. satisfying.    Of course, this place isn't cheap and I certainly wouldn't mind paying less.    But the cost was justified.",

SERVICE: i called earlier in the day to find out if i could make a reservation. the hostess said that the ONLY reservation was at 4pm. I didn't book that one, as it was way to early, but we decided to take a chance and drive into the city anyway. When we arrived around 7pm there were several empty two-tops and the bar was about half empty. we chose the bar. EXCELLENT service from the three or so bartenders! FOOD: so beyond good. i wish i had three stomachs so i could have tried everything. we shared the shortrib flatbread, tartare, fried brussel sprouts, and creme brulee..... COCKTAILS: again, excellent. i order a Manhattan everywhere I go and this one (ahem....two) were superb. also had a couple of cans of the Sofia Blanc de Blanc (bubbly in a cute little can! don't worry, they provide a champagne flute too)  overall, i wish it were here in LA. read a full review with photos over on my blog: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhourglassandbloom.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F01%2F07%2Fmeat-and-potatoes%2F&s=cdbf675d5b6c88fbd7e24cdbf08158cbf0df94db73a1b77e1bc899ee4795381c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hourglassandbloom.wordpr...</a>",

What how do those thing go together, extremely well that's how.  Hangar steak had some nice bitter micro greens, uber crispy potatoes, and a nice bright sauce to pull it all together...

    "text": "Terrific evening at Meat & Potatoes. We decided that the appetizers were more exciting than the main courses, so my wife and I put together a meal of the artisan cheese plate, mussels plus garlic bread and fries, and brisket mac and cheese. All terrific. The large bowl of mussels could certainly be a meal for one, and was a lot for two. The Diamondback cocktail was outstanding, with the yellow chartreuse and apple brandy adding nuances while letting the Bulleit rye shine. I'll be ordering these in the future. My one demerit, and the reason my review is not 5 stars: The tables for two are just too small. I admit, by having multiple appetizers, we required more than the usual amount of space, but the tiny round tables really don't work. Also, the bench seat along the wall is low and uncomfortable (I felt like I was sitting on a hump and worried that a spring might pop through), and I heard others complain about the cushioned chairs as well. Everything looks great -- but this is a case of form not following function. M&P needs to rethink this aspect of its design.",

For main course, we had the flatiron steak and the pork--both perfectly prepared, flavorful, and copious.  About that wine list... If you are going to offer so many options of deliciously prepared meat, it is my opinion that you should have a wine list to go with it.  The regular wine list on the menu is quite limited. The \"special\" wine list that the server showed us after the meal was over (since I asked) was very pricey.  I understand that this establishment is a gastro pub, and focuses on beer and cocktails.  However, it is my opinion that an expanded wine list would greatly improve the quality of the meals, especially if it included options from Italy and France, and at reasonable prices.  There is no reason, in my mind, for a gastro  pub to ignore wine selection!  Otherwise, we have no complaints. I would be remiss if I did not mention that the desserts were delicious, both the lemon berry pie and the chocolate pot de creme.",

By the time we made it there from our 4 hour drive I was starving. We were seated right away and the ambiance was really cool. Unfortunately that was the most exciting part of my experience there. The mussels seemed to be very touted on the menu and the specials so I thought I would give it a try. I was a little disappointed as the flavor just wasn't there. My boyfriend ordered the tacos per other reviewers suggestions and they were so overly greasy that even between the two of us (who are big greasy fast food fans) we were only able to eat 2 out of the 3. Albeit I admit that since we went to a place called \"meat and potatoes\" we probably should have ordered something more red meat related. Maybe we wouldn't have been as disappointed? Who knows...I don't plan on going back to give it a try personally but my recommendation to you if you are planning a trip to meat and potatoes is to stick with the 2 person tomahawk meal and get the full experience....anything else will fall sub par to your expectations.",

I was expecting nice green-crispy brussels but received greesy brown brussels instead.  I thought they were overcooked so I asked the waitress if the brussels are normally cooked this way and she said yes.    On to the maincourse - I ordered the Pub Burger (medium) that looked wonderful upon arrival but was cooked closer to Well and was way too salty for my liking.  My guess is that the pork belly was the main culprit for the salty burger.  Let's just say I had order envy of my wife and friends meals.  The pork dinner and chicken pot pie were tasty but the mussels (beer sauce) were just above average.  If you want good Mussels go to Pt. Brugge.    All in all a decent place but I would not rank in the top 3 in the 'Burgh as others have noted.",

The food had enough ingredients to make sandwiches etc. more upscale, without going over the top.  It's a place I can take my foodie friend to, and also my, for lack of a better word, meat-and-potatoes boyfriend.  The interior was lovely - dark brown and white coloring, a little cramped (but pleasantly so, if that's a thing), and intimate.  The dessert was a pomegranate rosewater cheesecake.  I think that's all that needs to be said.  The reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price and the service.  The price is a bit higher, which I have no problem with if the experience is worth it.  Although the food was delicious, the overall experience just wasn't up to par with what we paid, in my opinion.  The service was also painfully slow for lunch.  Most restaurants open for lunch downtown move at a faster clip than dinner, since most patrons are taking a 1-hour lunch break.  Eating there took almost 2 hours.  Overall, I would still go back there in a heartbeat.  The food and atmosphere was great, if you don't mind paying a little bit more and have the time.",

For our entree we shared the Meat and Potatoes for two with fingerling potatoes and Brussels sprouts. We loved the sprouts. The meat was cooked well (medium rare) and seasoned nicely. It was pretty fatty though so when all was said and done we didn't get as much meat as we would have liked. Will probably return to try some other dishes.",

One dish you won't regret getting is brisket mac & cheese (no matter how bad it may be for our bodies). We could've (and did) eat it with a spoon. I could eat that melted gouda cheese goodness like a bowl of soup.  Yes to the meatloaf and potatoes (was on the fall menu). The meatloaf was divine, the potatoes perfectly buttery and creamy, and the onion rings added the right crunch.   Things I think are worth skipping - 1) the bone marrow. We've only had bone marrow several times, but there was not much flavor to the marrow compared to others we've had. It tasted just like fat smeared on bread. And the capers were far too salty. 2) the poutine - we love our poutine but these were just a little underwhelming.",

    "text": "Delicious meat, delicious potatoes. Came here one if the evening sir spent in Pittsburgh at a recommendation from a friend. Totally worth it, if you like meat that is.   Went with the poutine as a starter, which in hindsight we could have not ordered because we ended up so full. It was delicious. They know how to do their potatoes, and the fries with the gravy did not disappoint.   The Caesar salad was interesting with the fried egg and I enjoyed having some greens before the 45 oz. bone in ribeye.   The \"build your own meat & potatoes for two\" is a sight to be seen. It says share between two people but we comfortably shared between four and couldn't even finish (partly due to the sides and the starters?)  The meat was an enormous medium rare perfectly cooked piece of beef. Tender and juicy. Lovely. The sides were also delicious. Huge fan of the confit potatoes - very rich. The brussel sprouts and cauliflower great as well. To top it off you've got the bone marrow that comes with the beef.   All in all, delicious food, cool vibe, definitely worth a visit.",

There is one entire side of the bar devoted to all of the hot sauce, olives, cheese, meat, and vegetables you could ever want to put into your bloody.   Everything else was great, too - quick service, seated immediately (with prior reservations), and a fun atmosphere. Did I also mention their brunch menu is amazing?! They offer a wide variety of options, with something for everyone. We went with the croque madame with a side of fries and avocado toast... we split both and couldn't decide which we liked better, since they were both that good!  I definitely recommend this spot for a delicious Sunday brunch, but be sure to make reservations before hand, as there was a steady crowd with very limited seating all morning.",

Would highly recommend reservations especially if there's a show in town. Sometimes you can grab a seat at the bar which is smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. I had the perfectly cooked flat iron steak with minor modifications to make it gluten free, while my husband enjoyed the meatloaf that I believe was on special. I'd imagine we'll be back here to try more of their dishes before a show or another event.",

    "text": "We were so excited to find mussels for my husband and eat at one of the best rated restaurants in the Pittsburgh. For the most part, it was great, so I'll start with the good. Ambiance is fabulous. Interesting, not too dark, most comfy chairs ever and friendly servers. Everyone smiles and helps out. Prices are mid to high, but seem appropriate. Range from $12 to $75, so you can spend a little or a lot, which I appreciate in a restaurant. Automatic chilled water bottles is quite refreshing on a hot evening- loved it. Fried Brussels- so yummy and crunchy, even our 15 year old ate a few of them. Pot Roast- I think our son would have licked the plate if he could have. Vegetables cooked just right. Meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes had the perfect consistency, so yummy with the gravy. Mussels- my husband was on cloud nine. He loves mussels and these were amazing. The wine broth with the grilled sourdough was full of flavor, just the right saltiness. Fritas- crispy, fresh, hot, my favorite of the night.  Now, the disappointing part. The wild mushroom risotto. It looked gray (compare photo with other reviews) and it smelled and tasted off. There was hardly any risotto, mostly mushrooms and gray mush that tasted like it may have had flour added to it. After being up and down all night with gastrointestinal challenges, still belching this morning, with abdominal cramping, I'm super disappointed in the restaurant for serving this last night. Since we moved out of San Francisco to po-dunk nowhere in Tennessee over a decade ago, I assumed that I had just lost my \"cultured palette\". Three employees questioned why I wasn't eating the risotto. To be polite, my husband said I was just not used to so many mushrooms. My son asked if Gordon Ramsey would approve. For $14, I would think you taste the risotto and toss it if it is rotten. So, if you think the risotto if spoiled, trust your gut, or your gut will pay. 12 hours later, I'm still paying for it.",

My boyfriend and I went for my  birthday dinner knowing it would be expensive, however my $14 cocktail in this little itty bitty glass left more to be desired. Our waiter asked if I wanted another and I laughed and said no, and he was very confused.  The redeeming thing about this place are definitely the truffle fries and the brussel sprouts. Trust me, if you get those apps, the evening will be worth it. My boyfriend got the 22 oz pork, and I got steak, and of course they were delicious, but not really anything too different or special.  Our waiter however rocked. I don't remember his name, but he was so friendly and accommodating, and when I said I had a gluten allergy, he took that very seriously and made sure I knew what I could and couldn't eat on the menu, as well as notifying the kitchen. This place is worth going for the apps and atmosphere, but I would definitely drink before coming.",

With meat and potatoes I have had a wonderful experience each time. This place is great for a date night, an evening out with a small group of friends, and even a celebratory meal. I'm a fan of Moscow mule and the doctor mule is great! It has peppercorn infused vodka which gives it a little kick and still keeps it refreshing. They have great cocktails and an adorable bar in the center of the main room. There are small tables along one side which are not as private as I'd like for a first date or intimate conversation but the vibe is still great and provides a laid back elegance - if you can imagine that. Lighting is dim and the room is modern. The food is so amazing! The portions are large and if you get any appetizers you could probably split a meal. The 45 ounce ribeye is listed for two people to share. So my parents - they never leave scraps- ate maybe half of it. It could probably serve an entire table. It was delicious but unfortunately undercooked. Undercooked is better than over cooked, especially when you're talking about an 80 dollar slab of meat! Definitely worth trying and splitting. One of my favorite items is the brisket Mac and cheese. I've gone just for that and drinks and I've been very content. The Brussels sprouts are crisp and delicious and the lemon aioli is perfection. I've also had the flat iron and actually split this with my husband after having some apps and it was so delicious. If you haven't been to meat and potatoes you are definitely missing out!",

I'd recommend not getting any sort of appetizer if you're eating alone and want to finish it. I'm a big eater and could hardly finish.

It's been around for a while so it might not have the new and exciting vibe as some of the other spots, but there's a reason it gets rave reviews. They do a great job.  I've gone for dinner and lunch (when they were open during lent) and everything has been delicious. My favorite thing to get is mussels, but even just a regular old burger is awesome here. You can go as fancy or casual as you'd like with the menu, and their cocktail list is awesome. Service is always attentive without being overbearing. Even with other new and trendy places popping up around town, I keep coming back here.",

    "text": "We usually dine at Meat and Potatoes a few times a year.  Mostly so my wife can satisfy her duck cravings.  I have to admit after reading some recent reviews about M&P I was a little nervous.  We have always had a good experience here and I didn't want that to end.  Well the jury is out and M&P is still one of our favorite restaurants.   I made reservations awhile ago for 515pm.  I could have made them for later in the night but I thought we were going to go to the baseball game right after so I made it this early.   We ended up not going to the baseball game this night and we were feeling rushed to get there by 515.  So my wife called to see if they were able to bump our reservation to a little later time.  She talked to a hostess and they were polite and changed our reservation until 645pm.  That was great and it worked out so perfect for us too.       When I made the reservation I requested that we could sit outside.  The girl on the phone said they couldn't guarantee it but she would put a note that we would like to sit outside.  We love M&P but sitting indoors can get squished.  That is probably the only thing that we don't like about M&P.  You sit so close to other tables that you can hear their conversation and they can hear yours just as easily.  So that's why we requested to go outside.   I dropped off my wife in the front and then I parked.  She asked them too sit outside and we got to!  If it's a nice day sit outside at M&P!  You have a lot more room and you can't hear your neighbors conversation.       So far so good!  I ordered a water and wifey got a Black Manhattan.   She ordered her Duck and I ordered the Pork.  The food came out at a good time and it looked great.  She liked her duck although she said it was better in prior times but she still liked it a lot.  I really liked my smoked pork shop.  It was huge and it came with pastrami pork belly, baked beans, and spicy collard greens.  The temperature on the pork was perfect.  Even my wife tried it and loved it she said.        Did we luck out?  Has the service and food gone down this past year? I don't know.   Maybe it has but for my personal experience it hasn't.  We will be back like usual in 6 months so she can her duck and I will try something new.",

It's hard to comment too much when people get it right! Here is a photo of said steak! It was larger than my head.

I ordered a dill pickle and jalapeno infused vodka bloody. The server came back with a glass of ice and vodka. I didn't realize it was a make your own, interactive thing. That was really fun and my garnishes were real out of control. The vodka on its own was really delicious, and so was the final drink.  My date ordered the morning mule which tasted fantastic with the fresh ginger and prosecco. This is officially my 2nd favorite mule of all time.  We then ordered the kimchi bloody which was good and the seelbach, which was fantastic and knocked me on my A.  To eat, I ordered the burger, sans bun.  I didn't want fries so I asked for salad mix or a vegetable and I was advised there was nothing like that on the brunch menu and no, I could not have it. Seriously, not a single vegetable to be had. Odd, and highly disappointing. The burger was ok, though the condiment choices did not make sense to me. One was ketchup and one was a pink mayo based chunky sauce of sorts. Neither enhanced my burger and in fact, both took away from the burger. Maybe a grainy mustard or an au jus or something more appropriate.  My date ordered chicken and waffles and literally it was a huge waffle with 5 boned chicken parts. Totally not what he expected, considering you basically had to eat the chicken with your hands and part of chice and waffles is covering the whole thing with maple syrup... It was a complete mess and very uncomfortable looking. He advised it tasted good, after I let him know it's not his fault if he left looking like a 2 year old with food all over himself.  All-in-all, the experience was ok. They def make one great cocktails. The food left a bit to be desired.",

I've never had it before and I was told that if you're going to try it, make sure you try it at a place that does it good and does it right.  And that place would be right here, at Meat and Potatoes. It was phenomenal. Delicious and cooked to perfection. Yeah, $18 is a lot for this appetizer, but how often would you have this? And, would you want to try and make it a home? No. (what does that saw look like?)  So, I came here for one dish and it was perfect!  I did look around at other meals being served and they all looked good.  The only negative is that it's very noisy. If you are coming here for a nice, quiet dinner for two, forget about it. The tables are very close together and there is no privacy. This is how I met the two ladies sitting next to me while I dined. I could hear everything they said and ended up sharing my Bone Marrow meal with them. Yes, it's dark and noisy, but the food made it all worth while.",

The sweet Thai chili sauce it was in was delicious and I could not stop eating the pig ears. It was garnished with cilantro and thin slices of quick pickled cucumbers. The acidity balanced the sweetness of the sauce.   For our entree, we built our own Meat & Potatoes for Two, which includes a 45 oz rib eye and bone marrow gratin. Everything exceeded our expectations! We ordered the steak with the house steak sauce, mashed potatoes, and a side of the roasted cauliflower. The bone marrow gratin was very rich and flavorful and paired well with the steak.  We ordered a medium-rare rib eye and it was very tender and juicy.  The house steak sauce was like a combination between A1 and Ketchup. The roasted cauliflower had a sweet flavor and it was delicious.   We booked reservations a week before to make sure we could eat here. The rib eye with the additional sides ended up being around $120. The food was absolutely delicious that we were happily paying for it.",

    "text": "The wait was definitely worth it.  We've been meaning to come here for the longest time. You either need to walk-in and hope you can find an open table or make a reservation weeks and sometimes even months in advance. While I hate planning my dinner plans that long ahead - I craved and made my RSVP 3 weeks in advance for a date night thru Yelp.  They have an option of indoor and outdoor seating. But since it was somewhat of gloomy evening - we chose to sit inside. The seating area especially those for 2 are very close to each other but not too close to bother us. The place is dimly lit and it can be at times be pretty noisy. They have the regular menu and a special of the day menu that includes few starters, drinks, main course and desert that are specially priced for the day.  We started with a dark and stormy for the lady and a draft beer that was on special. For the starters, we went with their famous Bone Marrow and Fried Pig Ears. Since my lady doesn't eat Beef - I devoured the Bone Marrow on my own including some Fried Pig Ears. I must say, I was a bit disappointed with the Bone Marrow. Although delicious - it just wasn't as good as I had hoped for or perhaps my expectation was just too high. I would probably skip the Bone Marrow next time. The Fried Pig Ears dipped in sweet chili sauce was really good though.  For our main course, I went with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast and she got the Salmon. The medium rare duck breast was juicy and delicious and had a certain sweet flavor to it. Not something I would recommend pairing with the Bone Marrow. The salmon was however a different story. They are absolutely delicious and the combination with black rice, kimchi, korean hot sauce and fried egg was just perfect. I can't recommend the salmon high enough.  The service was just as good.  We will definitely be coming back.",

In any event, I wanted to wrap up my birthday weekend with brunch at M&P because I hadn't been here yet for that and I've been told they have the best bloody mary in Pittsburgh.  Our food was great. Our bloody mary's were just...alright.  Our service was...meh.  I love the atmosphere of Meat and Potatoes. It is not a huge space but they do utilize it well and make the most out of it with the seating. I definitely recommend a reservation no matter what you're coming here for, otherwise there will be a wait.  It is bright and they had a DJ spinning real vinyls which was cool. It was very relaxed and vibe-y and their menu, though limited to brunch, is extensive in the sense that you can order breakfast or more lunch-type of items.  We started with the truffle fries and bloody marys. I got the bacon infused vodka for mine and my date had the horseradish vodka.  We braved the crowd to go to the bar to do the add-ins.  Mine was okay - not the best and not the worst.  The truffle fries were to die for.  I ordered the huevos rancheros for my meal and my date had the brisket hash.  The food came out piping hot and the flavor was really good.  The huevos rancheros were insanely spicy. Too intense for me almost.   Our waiter was not really  engaging us at all. He showed up when he had to, took our orders and brought out the food. It wasn't bad service, but it wasn't that good either. Which is disappointing, because M&P is a really nice place and the end bill reflects the atmosphere and the quality of food, so I wish the overall service/experience matched.  Regardless, I'd come here again because their menu is interesting and you know you're going to eat a satisfying meal.",

I sat at the bar so I could work on my tablet like an antisocial monster. I had the Aged Manhattan which was AMAZING at $12. Then the Sgt Pepper's Old Fashion, $10. The bartender & bar back were so nice and attentive, also chatty and cute (not relevant, just saying). The decor, glassware and room vibe were all great. I needed food after those great whiskey options & was pretty upset there was only one steak entree option at a place called Meat and Potatoes... I ordered fried pickles which were delicious & complained to the staff. Apparently they almost always have a steak feature in addition to the one entree & the 45 oz ribeye for two, just not during my visit.  Go here, hopefully you can get tipsy & eat steak.",

We started with the bone marrow appetizer. It was actually my first time trying bone marrow, and after tasting it, I don't know how I've ever gone without it. It was presented very nicely, and I loved that they had a few different kinds of accompaniments to give it different flavors. I think we had capers, sea salt, pickled red onions, and some sort of gremolata. I loved the sea salt and bone marrow combination.   For our meals, we got the pappardelle pasta and the mushroom flatbread and shared. The pappardelle was good, and had some great chunks of meat in there, but it was served with garlic bread that I honestly felt just detracted from the rest of the dish. The mushroom flatbread was tasty too, although nothing that made it extraordinary.   Overall, the place had a great atmosphere, bone marrow to die for, and some solid entrees. Would be back if I'm ever in the Pittsburgh area!",

    "text": "Now that you have to book a spot at M&P brunch three weeks in advance, the anticipation of the visit feels like half the fun. The meal itself isn't bad, either. ;)  The Bloody Mary bar is the highlight of the trip, every time, all the time. Grape leaves, sun-dried tomatoes, whole roasted garlic, sweet peppers, and every hot sauce on earth are just some of the accouterments to choose from when you take the plunge of building your own brunch time beverage experience. Don't be if it takes you six or seven minutes to craft your savory beverage/breakfast snack cup.  Now armed with two cups of booze and snacks, we return to our inappropriately small, round table to receive our meals from a despondent server. A great attitude is always appreciated, especially at brunch, in order to enhance the dining experience. A bad attitude is simply a missed opportunity. Admittedly we did chuckle after the server took a surprisingly condescending/undercover policeman tone after I ordered tequila for the bloody bar: \"IDs first, then we'll talk flavors.\" Aye aye, captain.  My dining companion made the superb decision to order the Bi Bim Bap. Its Korean spicy funkiness made for an incredible flavor profile. Perfectly cooked black rice, crisp cucumbers, and a sunny side up egg solidified the dish as a slice of heaven. During the ordering process I panicked and ordered a breakfast charcuterie tray. The small selection of meats, though attractively served on a butcher block, was salty even for cured flesh. The two deviled eggs were tasty, but not impressive. I noticed that this meal has since been removed from the menu. Good choice.  With a Bloody bar that's on fleek, and meals that consistently remind you why you're an omnivore, M&P is worth the wait.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about this place so we tried it out for the first time on a Saturday. We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance and they only had a 5:15 and 7:30 at that point so I would def. make reservations if you plan on eating here.   Pros: -Really cool interior design- industrial/glamorous feel to it. -The food- the food is Delicious. The combined flavors on everything is just awesome. I had the roasted chicken, my husband at the pot roast, and we split the cheese plate as an appetizer. It was all awesome. The cheese plate came with 2 different cheeses (I believe blue cheese was one of them with a sea salt on it), some delicious walnuts, fig? , and a spread with toast. It really hit the spot!   Cons: -Very tight seating. You will be about 1 foot away from other tables on both sides of you and when a waiter is at that other table, their behind will be in your face. Not a big deal but if your someone that is bothered by tight spaces and like your privacy, you will want to skip this place. -Bloody Mary- I was excited to see they had a bloody mary bar but found out it was only for brunch. I decided to order one anyway because I figured it would still be awesome. I mean, they have all the toppings for it still! Wrong- the drink was weak, not spicy, and was served with a lemon wedge and a tiny green olive. No cucumber, pepper ring, nothing. I thought they would at least throw a few things on a toothpick in the drink  Overall, I would come back here again for dinner, however I would skip the drinks or maybe try a drink they specialize in on their menu rather than ordering something off the menu.",

    "text": "First let me say that any restaurant that has fried pickles listed on the menu piques my interest.  Then to read on the menu that they make their own pickles in house was an extra bonus.  These pickles were thick cut and so favorable that I could probably have eaten a whole serving of just the plain pickles, but everyone knows that frying something gives it a little extra savory flavor. The coating they use was perfect, crunchy, and complimented the pickle itself.  The spicy ranch used as a side for dipping when added made this treat, for lack of a better term, perfection.  My god, my mouth is watering even now as I write this.  Enough with the pickles though.  When we arrived at Meat & Potatoes a show was letting out at the Cabaret, so we weren't sure we would get a seat.  If we didn't there were more places to choose from in the Cultural District.  Luckily for us, when we walked in and were greeted by the hostess and asked if we had a reservation and our answer was no, we weren't turned away.  We were told that we could wait for a table or walk in and find a bar seat.  We opted for a bar seat, good choice.  Once we sat down we were basically tag teamed by the bartenders.  One was handing us a menu and telling us the drink specials as the other was pouring us a glass of water.  The menu is small, but that didn't make the decision making any easier...at all.  It was easy to pick the appetizers, fried pickles as mentioned before and we also got an order of poutine.  Since I've already salivated all over myself, the keyboard and the floor because of the pickles, I really shouldn't write more about them.  I will focus on the poutine.  As it was said before by other reviewers, these are spiced to perfection and as I am going to say, melt in your mouth.  Imagine if you will if you decided to go to Kennywood to get some Potato Patch fries and instead you walk up and they were substituting Meat & Potatoes version instead.  Just take the Potato Patch fries and miniaturize them.  Fresh cut, fried up to a nice golden brown and tossed with some of the best spices you can imagine.  Cheese curd melted throughout and topped with some of the best gravy you can find.  These and the pickles could have been a meal enough for me, but you know I didn't stop there.  While we waited for our entrees to show up, we had a libation as well.  I opted for the Erie Oatmeal Stout while my friend had herself a Moscow Mule.  Both were so satisfying, but I can tell you that the Moscow Mule was by far tastier with the combination of food we were having.  While we also waited for our food to come out the bartenders made chit chat with everyone that was seated around the bar.   Recently I have been on a quest to find the perfect burger in the Burgh, so of course I opted for their Plain Jane burger.  I can say that this is one of the few places that can cook a burger to medium well and it tastes like it's cooked medium well.  Perfect portion of burger too, the patty was a little thicker in the middle but I wasn't worried about that.  Romaine lettuce, tomato, red onions and more house pickles to top the patty.  I also opted to add cheese, a nice white cheddar.  This time the pickles were sweet pickles and the mixture of taste with all the toppings was like a mouthgasm.  From the bun to the pickles I was very happy.  The burger was definitely an excellent decision to make that night.  More pomme frites were a side here and sadly, after all that great food, I could not finish them.  Definitely a return trip to this place, and definitely a bar seat again for me.",

I had the pappardelle based on the server's recommendation but was a but disappointed. The dish had chunks of meat and a chunky tomato pancetta sauce but the flavor was a bit more basic than I expected. The noodles were great but overall it was just ok. Wish I had the beef!

My mom and I came here with no reservations on a Sunday night and were given a seat in under 20 minutes-open table had no more reservations and I knew it was a long shot, and I am so thankful I got a table!  The cocktails were expertly crafted and delicious, the menu touched on something for every palate, and the service was impeccable. I have not had a meal this good in a very long time-I had the poutine and manchego/chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates to start, followed by pastrami crusted duck, and finished with the malted chocolate pot au creme. I then rolled home in a food drunk stupor, and laid on my bed asking God why the food was so good that I was forced to eat all of it.  Go here, it's worth the price-your eyes, mouth, nose and tummy will be so happy with you.",

I'd been wanting to go here for a while, and I finally had the presence of mind to snag a reservation during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. My date and I both got the PRW fixed three course menu.   ATMOSPHERE & SERVICE: Meat & Potatoes is a constantly busy place, especially at peak dinner hours when we went. Rather than being overly loud or hectic though, I felt like all the people around us created this vibrant energy through the restaurant. All the while, our server was patient and attentive and added to the great experience.   FOOD: the restaurant week menu was beautifully crafted, with a lot of diverse flavor profiles. We started out with a tart crudo, followed by a savory squid ink pasta, then pork ribs with a sweet cranberry sauce. Of course, I had to add on a dessert, which was a little lemon meringue pie in a jar. They were small portions, but each dish was wonderfully crafted.   My date and I both really enjoyed our plates. It didn't blow our minds, but the creativity of the dishes was really nothing I'd seen before. It's absolutely worth a visit!",

When we were seated it probably took 10 minutes before our waiter came to greet us and get us some water - and we were parched from being out on a humid day. So that wasn't a great start to our experience.   We ordered their fried taters, bone marrow, corn dog, pork belly tacos, mushroom risotto and the lamb leg. Their fried taters were well seasoned and went well with the black truffle mayo. It was my first time eating  bone marrow this way and it was very oily but I think it's naturally that way so overall it was good when eaten with the other condiments it came with. The corn dog wasn't anything special but the sauce gave it a little kick. The mushroom risotto was delicious and was probably the best dish of the night. The lamb leg dish was okay and probably wouldn't be something I would order again from here. It was very oily and a bit salty. I didn't try the tacos but the person who ate them said it may have been the best they have had. The pork belly was crispy that it melted in his mouth.   When we were done with dinner, it took a good 15-20 minutes before we were waited on again for leftover boxes, check, etc. Overall our waiter didn't check on us enough and wasn't very friendly. So in a nutshell, the food can be a hit or miss - and I would stick to popular dishes for the hit - and the service has a lot of room for improvement.",

As a word of warning, I've found the dishes to all be rather greasy.  This includes the salads.  You should expect that given all name, but just a heads up.  The sandwiches are huge.  I enjoyed the Three Little Pigs and the burger.  I found the Korean Reuben to be a little off, I think it would be better without the cheese.  The salmon is great as is the pasta dishes.  All of the appetizers are great.  The only food I haven't had is the steak.  I haven't found anyone willing to share it with me yet.",

I typically spend a few minutes debating what to get before deciding on short rib hash, but there are so many good things on the menu I am always tempted to switch it up. The quiche changes every day and is always good and oh my gosh - the flat bread... both the salmon and the brisket are a great way to start the way.  I'm not a huge bloody mary fan myself, but that's what M&P is famous for so while you're here, definitely try one. If you are in need of coffee, try the Irish Breakfast. The whipped cream is made fresh and maple-flavored.  And last, whatever you do, remember that there is NOTHING wrong with eating dessert after every meal, including breakfast so save room for whatever dessert they are serving. I rarely recommend splitting dessert (since I hate sharing it) but in this case I'd say half a cupcake is plenty.",

    "text": "When a bartender is wearing suspenders, listen to said bartender's advice on cocktails and the menu.   I struggled with the menu choices. Everything sounded amazing and I wish I could have tried a bite of each dish. But I also thought I could get really good fish tacos, or pasta or cheese plates elsewhere. I was secretly craving pizza, so I lingered on the flatbread list. I decided on the mushroom/truffle.   \"Are you a vegetarian?\" the bartender asked when I ordered. \"No, not really,\" I replied. \"Then don't get the mushroom,\" he said. After all, the place is called \"Meat and Potatoes.\" So I asked for a small order of the fried taters with truffle mayo and the short rib (braised beef, bleu cheese) flatbread.  The Belgian-style frites were great, but I ate half of them and used the truffle mayo as a dip for the light, flaky, how-did-they-do-it buttery flatbread crust. The beef was tender and paired well with the cheeses and spicy greens. The pickled red onions were sweet and could have been sliced much thinner. Carmelized may have been a better option. Roasted, diced beets could have also given it a pop of red and and earthy note. Overall delicious.   The guys next to me at the bar were drinking the bartender's rum old fashioneds. A fan of brandy old fashioneds, I gave the cocktail a chance after learning the bar didn't have Korbel brandy (nope). Allspice syrup was the key to making this impossibly tiny, impossibly strong, impossibly delicious cocktail taste like Christmas and the solution for world peace. A common spice for braised beef, it paired well with the short rib flatbread. Ask for it.   Probably shouldn't go here if you're in a BIG hurry to eat or make the curtain call at one of the area theaters. Even at the bar, service was slow and the place was packed (reservations are pretty key here). But this place lends itself to taking your time, slipping slowly, and enjoying well-crafted food. As casual-hip as it was inspired, I had a great meal. So glad I went.",

    "text": "This was our second trip to Meat & Potatoes.  Both have been verey good, just short of excellent.  Service was friendly, and though the tables are very close to each other, somehow it works in this place.  Perhaps it is the overall gregarious atmosphere.  Now to the food...  We started with 3 apps: (1) The grilled bread was great as always.  Great value at $3, always perfectly toasted, with superb butter and jam.  (2) Mushroom flatbread ($12) - also great, just as good as the shortrib flatbread we had last time.  Portions are generous.  (3) Yellowtail cerviche - This was the one downside, and it was pretty far down.  It was $12, and had 6 little scrapings of yellowtail.  All I could thing of was \"margins\" as I was eating this - it must be 90%+.  Also, while the sauce around the scraps of yellowtail were good, there was nothing to get it up with.  I asked the waiter about it, and he offered a spoon instead of bread.  With so many other good things on the menu that are tasty and filling, I highly recommend you avoid this menu item.  My wife had a pasta (farfelle) with shortrib and pork shoulder ($18) - so excellent!  I then had a burger with pimento cheese toppings, which was outstanding - meat to bun.  Also, the fries it came with were perfect - all only $12.  Finally, we sampled 3 different drinks - their signature bourbon cocktail, and two vodka based cocktails.  All were great, and all cost $10.  There was just enough alcohol and overall flavor in them to justify the price.  Overall, Meat & Potatoes continues to please.  Other than the yellowtail app, they are avoiding overly \"shi-shi-ing\" themselves by providing hearty, innovative food and drink at a moderate price.",

    "text": "Next time I take a trip to Pittsburgh, I'm definitely going to also at that point take a trip to YUMTOWN.  I mean Meat & Potatoes.  I like that an ampersand is in the name of the restaurant.  (I just wanted to use that word.)  Delicious!!!!  Suuuuuuper classy fancy schmancy but dressing up is FUN!  It's in kind of a weird location, I was like, am I going into an office?  But it shares space with another establishment (I want to say...bowling alley?) and they share bathrooms too which are clean, by the by, and probably bigger than they would be if they DIDn't share the bathroom so...that worked out.    Very nice hostess, they checked my coat for me.  Not that that's like something that would separate them from the rest but, just so you know they do that.    LET'S talk about the food!  So yummy!  We were there with lots of people so we shared a bunch of stuff and we had two kinds of mussels--one curry and one regular garlic butter white wine and BOTH were wonderful.  There wasn't a yucky mussel or a gritty one in the bunch, which can totally ruin your minute or more if you aren't laid back.  The curry one was so different but soooo so so good.  Then I had the pork belly tacos and...like, seriously, they have come up in my dreams.  IN MY dreams.  I remember biting into the first one and my pupils probably dilated instantly.  I'm saying that my neurotransmitters immediately fired.  I'm saying they tasted good.  They were served with fresh lime slices and there was a teensy bit too much cilantro draped over it but I picked it off and that was easy to do so...thanks.  You obviously know that people have cilantro things and were thoughtful.    Ned insisted on ordering the meat & potatoes for 2 dish and eating it by himself.  It was...impressive and also frightening.  It was also BEAUtiful!  Huge gigantic dinosaur sized (not really) bone with marrow just glistening there in the candlelight.  I really don't like bone marrow.  Ugh.  The steak was juicy and the potato wedges were huge and the whole thing was slathered with mushrooms and onions and served on a huge cutting board.  It's the kind of steak that makes a man feel like a man.  I think.    Man, now I want those pork belly tacos again.  OK, drinks!  They make a good martini, they have a decent beer list and a good wine list too.    Back to food.  Desserts!  AHHH I'm so glad I had a little room left because jesus CHRIST the desserts were all so good and so rustic looking.  Almost all of them except the tiramisu, I think, were served in mason jars and I LOVE mason jars.  A lot.  I realize that's not necessarily a plus for the masses but they were ALSO fantastically delicious!!!  Ned had the butterscotch....something like pudding or creme brulee with no brulee.  I don't know, all I know is that it was better than mine and I hate when that happens.    Go here!  It's great!  Not too badly priced either.  Definitely going back when I blow through the Pitts.  The burgh.  The Pittsburgh.",

Luckily Elvira and friend left (no doubt heading to the Michael Moore film festival) soon after and M&P became a much better place to be.  In town for one night only, I saw the great yelp reviews of M&P and decided to give it a try. In the mood for something light, I decided to sample the wedge salad and, as a recent convert and aspiring bone marrow aficionado decided that to give it a whirl, too.   The recommended Cab was good but not great, the wedge salad was cold, crisp, and just the right amount of blue cheese dressing and fresh blue cheese crumbles. So far , I'm 2 for 2. Over my shoulder I hear \"Your bone Marrow, Sir?\"  Holy Fred-freaking-Flintstone, I'm served the largest portions and sizes of marrow I've ever seen - gynormous even by (my accustomed) Texas standards. Perfectly broiled with grilled bread, sea salt, pickled onions, chive and -surprise!- capers, it was amazingly good. And amazingly rich. And more than one man should eat, even Fred and Barney in their prime. I was semi-successful doling out samples to those around me  - despite the inner voices in my head from my Mom telling me to clean my plate - I had to quit after two of the three bones. This is absolutely awesome and you must try it - just bring a friend or two when feeling especially carnivorous.  Five stars to you M&P - when back in DT PB I will darken your doorway again on the nearest, convenient, Elvira-less night.",

The only other restaurant I know of in town that does equally wonderful preparations of meat is Union Pig & Chicken in East Liberty.

I had the flat iron steak for my entree. Very tasty and tender, but chewier than a fillet. I asked them to go easy on the salt on this which they did! However, the potatoes, mushrooms were again over salted. My husband had the pasta Pappardelle. I have had this at other places and enjoyed it more. He had the same reaction. It was good, but not fantastic. Another friend had the pot roast. He was disappointed with the size and said it was not warm enough. I would recommend it to friends. Service was great.

We started with an order of grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb jam which I thought was perfect!  BJ got the short rib hash with poached egg and  horseradish hollandaise.  He thought the flavor was excellent!!  I got one of the specials which was chorizo quesadilla served with potatoes au gratin and pickled veggies and avocado cream.  So, so yummy.  The portion sizes were adequate, leaving you satisfied but not over stuffed.  We also decided to have a red velvet cake and shared a Irish Breakfast coffee.  The coffee was served in a brandy glass with Jameson, bacon whipped cream and zest of orange.  Perfect ending to a fantastic brunch!",

The decor wasn't quite what I expected, but not bad.  The food was great.  We started with the kobe corn dog and fried brussel sprouts.  The corn dog wasn't really better than the best corn dog I've had before in my life but the fried brussel sprouts were something new and delicious.  They were crispy on the outside but still juicy on the inside.  My boyfriend got the pot roast and I got he pastrami crusted duck.  His pot roast was good, but I had to protect my duck from him after he tried a bite.  I have never tasted anything like it.  The combination of flavors made you keep searching for more.  It was rich without being too rich and the saurkraut pierogis that came with it was a great balance to the duck.  I highly reccomend this place to anyone who enjoys classic food in a way that you've never experienced it before.  I ordered some of their specialty drinks, two that were gin based.  I can't recall their names now but they were not my favorite thing on the menu.  Dessert was a \"pot de creme\" which was the perfect amount of sweetness after my meal.",

We were told their would be a short wait which was to be expected, but the host came over and updated us which was much appreciated.   I ordered a bloody mary from the bloody mary bar. Wow, what a cool idea. They bring you infused vodka on ice and you take the glass up to the bar and create your own bloody mary. The bar had countless spices, hot sauces, vegetables and even had meats and cheeses you could add if you so desired.   The food was freaking incredible. My girlfriend got chicken and waffles, the waffles had jalapeno and cheddar in them, and it came with bacon syrup. The chicken was moist and tender.  My shrimp and grits were delicious. The shrimp were large and tasted so fresh, the grits were creamy and the sauce was succulent. The portion sizes of both meals were generous and that is a huge plus in my book.  Lastly, our server was a pro. He was quick, attentive, and knew the menu very well.   This was a slam dunk, 5 star experience all around. I will definitely be back and will bring visiting friends and family here when they are in town.   I give Meat and Potatoes my highest recommendation.",

As a Miami Beach local, I am used to overpriced cocktails but was surprised by this in Pittsburgh.  Afterwards, we were seated at a very comfortable table for two closely nestled between two other tables. I tend to avoid seating situations like this, but it wasn't overwhelming. In fact, it gave us an opportunity to see what other diners were enjoying. To my surprise their signature appetizer is bone marrow, which is literally served in the cow bone, which is then spread across bread.   We weren't feeling adventurous enough for that and decided to try the fried pickles, risotto, and Mac n Cheese instead. We split our entree - a flat iron flap steak, which was perfectly cooked and jam packed with flavor.   The wine list was simple and in comparison to the cocktails, very affordable, I had a bottle of Malbec while my boyfriend went with a bottle of Pinot Grigio - both under $34.   Overall the staff was pretty attentive but we still had to hunt down our waitress every so often. I absolutely hated their choice of glassware. Wine served in tumbler glasses and martinis served in a weird sort of snifter. I'll pass on that.   I would recommend this place to friends.",

We got one at 1030 when they open, and by the time we left the place was packed!  We all had the bloody Mary bar, which was fabulous!  You can pick from an assortment of tequila, vodka or gins that are all house made with chills, bacon and all sorts of flavors.  Then they have a counter full of everything you could want to make a delicious bloody Mary.  Everyone ordered something different.  I had the Huevos Rancheros.  It was excellent!  I ate the whole thing!  Yummy tortilla layers with beans, salsa, eggs, and cheese!  Others at the table got breakfast sandwiches, that looks amazing and if you are really hungry, the chicken and waffles which was enough for 4 people!  We also got some fries to share that come with a yummy truffle mayo!  I highly recommend the Brunch!",

    "text": "On a whim we decide to walk in to this highly recommended restaurant in the theater district of downtown pittsburgh later on a saturday night with no reservations and surprisingly did not wait long to get a table.  It truly lives up to its name because the meat and potatoes were epic.   The hanger steak was perfectly prepared and absolutely divine laid out on top of delicious fingerling potatoes.  However, the soft shell crab tacos fell short for me.  I love soft shell crab and these really missed the mark.  They weren't in any way complimented or highlighted in their presentation.  Our appetizer, the devils on horseback or dates wrapped in bacon with sirhachi, were delicious and the bacon made desire...well, more bacon.  It was so good.    A+ to the staff and the ambiance but not a huge fan of the up close and personal seating arrangements.  I find that most modern and trendy spots seem to want you on top of the couple next to you and everyone walking behind you.  I also was a bit put off by our server bringing a can of beer and a glass to the table and pouring it table side.  Maybe it's just me but I don't want the illusion there's a bunch of igloo camp coolers in the kitchen labeled with beer types they're fishing our libations out of.    All in all, it's not always about the food and with good company any meal can be a positive experience.  I would return again soon as the menu offers a wide array of choices I just couldn't get to that night.  Great place.",

    "text": "Meat & potatoes for two. So SO yum.  Bf and I were here about a month ago for dinner and libations. We ordered the \"build your own\" meat & potatoes for 2 for $75. This sounds like a bit of a hefty price tag but it is so so so worth it. An order includes a 45oz rib eye served next to their signature bone marrow gratin. So tender. So savory. I'm making myself drool just thinking about it. For $2 extra we also got chimchurri sauce (other sauces are available though, depending on your taste) as well as a side of truffle fries and mushroom ragu for an addition $8 apiece. While all that added up pretty quickly, the truffle fries were seasoned to perfection: evenly but not too heavy handedly and definitely some of the best I have had in a long long time. The entire meal was so good and the portions generous enough that we had enough to take home for lunch the next day.  The drinks, however, did not impress me so much. I am far from a connoisseur of craft cocktails, and since I am aware I know nothing, I always ask the experts (aka the bartender). Our bartender that night wasn't super helpful. Based on my preferences, he recommended the dark & stormy but bf was already planning to get that so I asked for another recommendation. He had none. This baffled me because.. I mean, he's the one that makes the drinks right??  I picked something else but didn't care for it and ended up not ordering a second because I was a little put off by that point (and also super stuffed from all the meat & potatoes).  All in all, would definitely recommend giving this place a try. The ambiance is nice. Dark and romantic enough for a nice date or boisterous enough for a girls' night for drinks and chat.",

    "text": "Coming in for restaurant week, we found that atmosphere to be pretty casual with some good music in the background and almost a full house. Service was also pretty timely with decent wait times between food servings. From the presentation of the food, you could tell that the chefs really paid attention to how things came together.   Taken individually, each item would probably have been a 5-star dish. The confit chicken thigh was nice and tender with a nice side salad mixed in. The mac and cheese was very flavorful and surprisingly filling despite its small size. And who could complain about the pork chop with pork belly, a huge portion of meat that went perfectly with the squash grits, not to mention the roasted apple with foie gras on the side?   The only problem in the end was that taken together, we found the meal to be a bit on the heavy side. Something lighter like a soup instead of the mac would have worked well. Or if the mac had been removed and replaced with a dessert at the end. Maybe even a smaller portion of the pork chop/belly, and a different pairing for the foie gras or apple. For the entree, having both pork belly and foie gras on the same plate definitely became a bit hard to swallow comfortably, particularly after the cheesy mac. But for anyone who was able to enjoy the entire meal, I'd say it was definitely worth the price.",

It's hard to believe this is a highly ranked and recommended restaurant in Pittsburgh since the steak was totally not worth the price (and the 1hr waiting time). There was about 1/3 of the steak was fat. And if you don't order any of the 8-dollar side dishes, all you can get is the beef and the bone marrow. I can't say the steak set was not savory at all but it was just too expensive for that amount of \"edible\" meat, and the variety of the steak set was the least I have ever had. I should believe some of the negative experiences listed in other reviews before I went and I recommend you should too. Although I don't like the food at all, the service was fine so I rated Meat & Potatoes a 2 star.",

We had to reconfirm (my issue) for the reservations, and arrived at 5:45 and awaited our friends who came in at 6:15 due to traffic.    The intake was flawless; the waitress, new to us, was the perfect representative of this trendy place in the cultural district.  We had to wait 25 minutes for others to show up but the wait staff came around ever 3 minutes to check...   Orders done quickly; and the kicker was the question about the time of the show we were going to... so .. the checks came out just in the proper time to hightail it over to the Byrham for Sister Act.   Food was all excellent.  So, I've modified my previous comments based on this last encounter.  We are going to establish this place at the \"go to\" when in this section of the cultural district.  While I am sure other places are great, why not just enjoy the ambience of a proven venue!     Remember the Cabaret is only a few yards away inside and the provides even more even possibilities.  Noone ever comments on this but... the restroom was perfect, coat racks located just outside the restaurant, and literature for the cultural district easily available.  So -- go, enjoy, tip generously.  Roy",

Just thinking about it gets me all quacked up.  First time there but definitely not our last trip to M&P.    We arranged reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and when we arrived the waiting area was packed with other reservation holders so reservations are a must.  I did see a table or two that was not occupied during our early dinner but I chuck that up to the hours we were dining, 5pm on a Saturday.  Well it worked out perfect since we were coming from an afternoon show.  I studied the menu for two weeks looking it over and over and wondering what I would order.  I had thought of the fried pickles as these are one of my favorites, or the pork belly taco's because come on pork belly in a taco!  Yum, but no.  My recent love affair with duck had me swooning for it...  I also saw so many wonderful pictures of the bone marrow I had to give that a shot too.  I can say confidently that I picked wisely.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  As I looked to my H who I convinced to order the Wagyu, I stated, \"Welcome to my new favorite restaurant\".  He absolutely loved the wagya, he said I wish there was just one more piece of it.  I think he could have had two... Lucky for me my plate filled me and though I could have eaten more I didn't have to, the portion was perfect.  I could've done without the pierogies.   I love pierogies but this one wasn't my thing.  All is fine I gladly gave them to my H to eat and he happily did so.  The atmosphere here seems casual with an upscale feel at the same time and the seats were like sitting on your overstuffed couch.  I melted in.  I will be back M&P you really got all your ducks in a row.",

I am not the type who can eat a lot of meat or potatoes. He insisted it was good, and he was right.   I love the decor and ambiance of the place. Everyone was super nice and funky. Funky in a good way. Cute clothes, hairstyles, and style overall. I loved it. The seats were a little weird. We were seated in the main dining area near the fireplace. When I sat I did NOT expect to sink as hard as I did. As a shorty, the seating was brutal.   We ordered so much it is hard to list it all. Out of what we ordered, I like the charcuterie board, and some dates wrapped in bacon (can't remember the name) but it was something you could write home about. We also ordered some pork bellies, and some other random things that weren't as memorable. We were also going to get bone marrow, but since we also ordered the HUGE Meat & Potatoes for Two which comes WITH a huge thing of bone marrow we decided not too.   The meat was awesome! We ordered medium rare, I think they wanted rare (I was with two people from France), but I think that style is a bit too \"blue\" for me. It still took about 45 minutes to come out. But with all the other food we ordered it was a quick and easy wait. I was so full at the end of the meal, but we still did order dessert. I think if it weren't for being embarrassed in front of my colleagues, I would have totally bent over and slumped home. My stomach was that full.   If I were in pittsburgh, I'd love to come for brunch. :) Next time, I'll still try to make a pitstop here :D",

I could have drank 10 of them.   Today was a spiced rum w cinnamon & apple cider.   Will def be back for brunch!",

We came for Saturday brunch and had the Bloody Mary bar. Their Bloody Mary bar had a large selection of charcuterie, dolmas, cheeses and vodkas - even bacon and mini meat sticks. I got the steak frites. It was cooked perfectly, and the fries were really good! Not going to lie, my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and those were even more tasty - everything you would want on a brunch! They gave him 4 huge pieces of chicken! The mimosas were good too. I would definitely come here again. 4 stars because even though the food was good and the service was great, it's not the best brunch I've ever had. This will definitely become a staple every time I visit Pittsburgh.",

I'm a native Chicagoan, where I expect my cities cramped and unfriendly and dirty. I was shocked by how much breathing room I had here.  Meat & Potatoes has a spread of crazy stuff on the menu, and I go in on daring dining. They have a slate of absinthe, including original recipe European imports, on the menu. Score! They do it up as a cocktail in the traditional way. Less green and halluciniatory than I had imagined, but what a fun experience :D  The actual meat of Meat and Potatoes was spot on. I had \"Pickled Chicken\" which is probably the worst name for a fried chicken sandwich I've ever heard. It is, however, pickled, so a logical name, but it really is a classic, mildly spicy fried chicken sandwhich. The breading is crispy, the chicken tender, Top notch experience all around.",

Had the bone marrow which is an acquired taste. The pot roast was OK but a little flavor would've put it over the top mashed potatoes were just airy extremely rich. Same with the duck neck where it is it melted in your mouth it was all extremely rich the only thing with flavor was the three slices of lamb sausage quarter sized I found on the bottom at the end of my meal which I would've loved to of found first. I can think of two dozen other places I would've loved to of spent my $118 But again it seems a lot of people are ordering burgers and sweet potatoe fries that kept walking by our table and I may come back for this just not the entrees",

    "text": "Guys, I finally made it to M&P!!  After a couple False starts, I finally got my act together, made a reservation well in advance, and brought a fellow aspiring foodie friend who was visiting town.  We split the bone marrow appetizer, which is three huge femurs and an assortment of toppings, served with toasted bread.  Fantastic.  I chose the special salad, which consisted of roasted Brussels sprouts with candied walnuts and a brisket vinaigrette dressing, and then talked myself out of the Wagyu flatiron (next visit) and into the pappardelle pasta dish that comes in a ragu sauce that was made by angels.  I opted not to get a cocktail and paired it all with a nice dry cider instead.  My friend got the pastrami crusted duck, and she delighted in it.  We both took ours home for a second meal.  We were well pleased.  Service was excellent, and the atmosphere is very much in keeping with the design aesthetic of this restaurant group--a bit eclectic, rustic, and modern hipster.  Well worth the visit, and I look forward to a return.",

It's quite the hipster scene, but the atmosphere is excellent so is the decor.   I've never had a bad meal or experience here. The duck liver pate is usually something I always order. I expected it to be gamey at first, but to my pleasant surprise it was not. The are mussel are great though I've only tried their curry variation. Pro tip - ask for extra toast/bread for the pate & mussels when you get it since they toast them to order. The duck I've had only once but it was well cooked and the texture was perfect. The devils on horseback were a bit too sweet for my taste so I did not care for them much. I'm still working my way through the whole menu, but I haven't had a True complaint about any of their dishes yet.    I've had a few and they're all exceptional, but the Southie is by far one favorite cocktails here. The bartenders do what they do well and they're all very friendly and accommodating.",

The menu is decent, but surprisingly lacks a variety of meat choices for dinners. Appetizers were above average. The fried pickles were nothing special. The short rib flat bread was great. The tater tots are fries, which is just dumb.  No bread is given prior to the meal, which is disappointing.  I had the pork chop. It's gigantic. It was cooked perfectly but did lack seasoning. I had a side of mashed, and they were just ok. Overall, it was alright.  My wife had the red fish. She didn't like it, and afterwards said she should've never ordered fish at a place called \"Meat & Potatoes\". I tried hers and it was indeed bland....kind of like our dining experience.  This will likely be the most boring review we write. Sorry about that.",

    "text": "This is just a super solid gastropub style restaurant. It's the first restaurant by the owner of Butcher and the Rye and tako, and I still think that, out of the three restaurants, the food is most consistently the best.  I have been here numerous times for dinner and for brunch, and the food is always decent and sometimes excellent.  I recommend the burgers, which are decently priced and done very well here.  Their tacos seem to rotate, but I had some delicious pork belly ones here awhile back.  I don't often order the main courses for dinner, so I can't really speak to the quality of those.  I like coming here for brunch even better than for dinner.  The main reason for this is their EPIC bloody mary bar.  When you order a bloody mary (which was at an *amazing* price of $5 the last time I was here ... I hope it hasn't increased since then) you can choose the spirit (vodka, tequila, sometimes flavored spirits, i.e. jalapeno or horseradish).  Then they just bring you the spirit and you go to the bloody mary bar to complete your drink.  Their baseline tomato juice mix is already very tasty, and then there are an assortment of hot sauces and spices that you can add to taste. Finally, there are SO MANY SNACKS you can add to your bloody mary, from the usual pickles and cornichons to cheese cubes, salami, bacon, and even grape leaves!  Since there is often a decent wait for brunch if you didn't make an advance reservation, my favorite thing to do is drink bloody marys during the wait.  Just don't fill up too much on the BM toppings, because you'll want room for the delicious brunch food.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go here for a long time and this past Saturday we were finally able to make it. For a place with such a strong reputation, I was hoping for a bit more. If the prices were cheaper and/or the portions were a bit bigger this would be a solid 4, but these issues, followed with not meeting my expectations from the hype of the solid reptutation left me not super impressed.  We started off with the Lobster Mac and Yellowfin Ceviche. Both were good, but a bit pricey. I really did like the ceviche, but it was only maybe 10 small cubes of tuna. Then, most of us got a cobb salad and we all thought it was a nice size portion and pretty tasty. I thought the avocado ranch was a little too subdued in flavor though. Also, it could have used just a bit more bacon for the saltiness and it almost definitely requires an extra side of dressing. Good deal and flavor overall; worth the price for the most part in my opinion, but it would be nice if it was a bit cheaper when combined with an entree.  As for my entree, I ordeded the salmon, which was pretty good, but was a bit too salty I believe from the Korean hot sauce. I needed about 4-5 glasses of water to get through dinner. I thought the portion was a good size and the price wasn't too expensive at $22. I got to try a couple bites of the Pot Roast and the Pork Belly Tacos as well, which were order by others at my table. The Pot Roast was good for pot roast, but not something I would normally ever order at a restaurant. Pot roast, in my opinion, is a meal your mom makes you at home. Then, I tried one of the pork belly tacos. It was interesting for sure. The toppings were very pleasant; however, something about the very fatty pork belly was not my cup of tea. For the money, this dish is a good deal, but I don't think I'd ever order it.  Overall it was a nice restaurant, but it has room for improvement and I was just expecting more after seeing all the great reviews on Yelp. Also, we had reservations, which we had arrived promptly for, but it took another 25 minutes or so to be seated and only after I asked the hostess. She told me that she texted the person who made the reservation a few minutes prior, but failed to turnaround and ask the people in the lobby if we were the party ready to be seated (we were sitting right behind her)... Not that everyone needs to order an appetizer, salad, and an entree, but it added up to about $50 bucks after tip, which is just a bit too rich for me for one person.",

We paid for parking, walked a couple of blocks and were NOT thrilled to hear there was a 4 hour wait - are you kidding me! We were told we could check the seating around the bar, we did. Squeezed into 2 end seats and were quickly greeted by the bartender complete with page-boy cap, suspenders, white t with sleeves rolled 3/4 of the way up - really added to the decor.  My hubby started with the Dunquesne Pilsner beer, and I started with an iced tea. The beer, in the words of my hubby, \"it was a good drinking beer\".   Our starter was the Artisanal Cheese Board, and it was super yummy! The local cheese was tasty, but my fav was the local strawberry preserves! Fresh dates, apple slices, candied pecans and toasted fresh bread were great accompaniments to the cheese.  Our entrees: Pappardelle for my hubby and the Brisket Sandwich. My mouth still waters when I think of my hubby's Pappardelle pasta! The pasta was fresh made, the short rib and pork shoulder were perfectly tender and tasty, the bolognese sauce was the perfect addition, not too overpowering, just right! My Brisket Sandwich was good, very big! The slaw was a little different than I expected, not in a bad way though. The overall taste was good, a solid 3 stars, but the Pappardelle deserved a solid 5 stars!  The overall place gets a solid 4 stars, but the pasta dish and our bartender service gets a 5!",

I ordered the duck breast Jan ordered the black bass. The duck was well prepared and seasoned correctly. The sea bass on the other hand was overcooked and so salty Jan could hardly eat it. We will not be ordering the black bass at  Meat and Potatoes again.",

Only downside was that it's very cramped in the seating area - if you have loud, nosey, or annoying neighbors, you are in for a bad experience.  Fortunately, we had none of those - in fact, our neighbors were very friendly & pleasant to chat with - so we had a great time.  It's a bit of a gamble, though.",

Very disappointing was that they brought entree about 2 minutes after appetizer platter showed up.  That's why did't get a 4-star rating.  Service should be on par!  The fresh pappardelle Bolognese was decent, not stellar, the pot roast was sublime.  The timing of the entree was the largest problem.

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW: I have to start by saying that my girlfriend and I have eaten here at least twice a month since we moved to the area 5 months ago. And it's usually pretty stellar. Tonight was a major exception.  This was our go-to place to bring friends and family when they visit, but we have changed our minds for this Friday, when our family is coming to town.  We ordered the new ginger cocktail, which we have had a few times since our favorite Bramble has left the menu. This time, the drink left my mouth burning with straight fresh ginger. After getting an eye roll and a sigh from our server, we were able to exchange them for the Clover Club drink. We then ordered the Kobe Corndog, which is usually a great appetizer. This time, it was cold. Sigh. But the kitchen mistakes don't stop there. I ordered the bone marrow, which arrived RAW. I was then challenged to an argument by a server (Shane?) who told me that 'technically it is cooked through'. The nerve to tell me that my bleeding bone marrow is 'technically cooked'. He was then gracious enough to 'have the chef take a look at it for me' ?!? Are you kidding? I didn't come out to eat to have to argue over my date's shoulder and the loud music over something as simple as putting a bone back in the salamander. My girlfriend and I both work in jobs where customer service is a top priority, and it would be nice to think that we could expect the same when we come out to eat.   To top it all off, our server never once checked in on us, and was so timid she didn't even ask if we needed a dessert menu.  We are really dissapointed in our experience this evening, we will not be returning to this place for a while.",

The house made steak sauce was prefect for the meat and the mushrooms it was a bit tangy with good spice. Just a few things to take note of the dish takes 45 minutes to cook so don't come prepared to order and eat in 5 minutes but trust me it's well worth the wait.",

On my last visit which was my first time having dinner here we all started with canned beer! Funny for a more fancy place but they do not have a lot of drafts. Those in my party started with the muscles and had a few sauces to choose from. They went with a beer bacon sauce that you could not go wrong with. My only complaint is they charged you for bread for dipping. For my entree I got the burger with cheese and asked to substitute mashed potatoes with fries. The burger bun was homemade and cooked to my liking. They brought out the fries instead of mashed potatoes but quickly fixed this and took it off our bill. Others in my party ordered the duck, hanger steak and pork and were very happy with their choices. Be warned the pork is a huge serving that comes with baked beans and collard greens.",

We've been there before and the food has been excellent.  As soon as we entered, we knew we couldn't stay. This place has decided to have a DJ on Sunday mornings. The music was so loud, with such heavy bass, that there was no way we would be able to carry on a conversation with our friends, much less enjoy a relaxing meal. The hostess offered to have the music turned down. After doing so, it wasn't any better.  So we left and had a lousy \"meal\" of bar food in the theater.  Why do places think it's a good idea to turn into a night club on an early Sunday afternoon?   We won't be back. Too bad, it used to be a nice place.",

    "text": "This is probably the only bar in Pittsburgh that can make a proper Last Word, not to mention that they have a couple of barrel-aged cocktails on the menu (Manhattan, Negroni).  Nice program, wasn't expecting to find that out here.    However, a bartender took my order and then proceeded to never serve it up.  I eventually just took my seat at the table when the party arrived.  Seriously, how hard is it to serve up a barrel-aged cocktail? -1 star.  Food wise, here's what we tried:  - Kobe Corn Dog (Solid) - Chorizo / Pulled Pork Mac-n-Cheese - Pub Burger (The menu here is confusing as it says pork belly pastrami, when really they just meant thick sliced bacon... come on guys let's stop watching so many episodes of Mad Men) - Korean Reuben - Fish-n-Chips (fried skate)  The burgers, sandwiches, and fish and chips were all great, but damn the portions were big.  If Jon Taffer ever came to this place he would say that the food costs are probably out of control.  An upscale place like this should be serving share plates like sliders, not giant deli sandwiches.  I can't complain about them for giving lots of food to us, it may be that they have to do that to compete for local business for all I know.  Just saying that I would have preferred more small plate options.",

    "text": "Meat & Potatoes, the name says it all!  So after catching a review for this on the food network a year ago I have been going crazy wanting to go here and try the \"Meat on a plate with potatoes for 2\" haha.  So first off let me say this, this place is small, but very nice! The waiting area has very comfortable couches and the waitstaff are amazing.  The seats at the table are tall-back chairs that are quite possibly the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in, after our meal I just wanted to take a nap in the chair.  Anyways onto the food and staff.  Our waiter was awesome, very attentive and left a bottle of water at the table. I love this and wish more places did this. Being able to serve ourselves more water and having you replace the entire bottle is the best idea, wish more restaurants would do this. He had great suggestions, knew how things tasted on the menu and really made our night.  The food.  Well obviously we had the steak for two with steak frites and bone marrow. The steak was HUGE, enough for 3 people!!! It was not only cooked perfect but the flavors were out of this world. It was tender, juicy and was perfectly seasoned.  The steak frites were huge and tasted great but the winner here was the marrow. I LOVE bone marrow. This is like the food from heaven. I love spreading it on bread, or in this case, my fries!  We ordered a few sides including the poutine and fried pickles. So the \"Snacks\" are as big as appetizers but come at half the price. The poutine was perfect. The fries were crunchy and salty, the gravy very meaty and the cheese curds were actual curds! They did in fact squeak on your teeth haha. The poutine was exactly as I hoped it would be.  The fried pickles are chips, but they are THICK and I mean THICK. The pickle itself had an amazing pickling, I'm not quite sure what they used but it was great!  Overall this place exceeded my expectations and the next time I'm in Pittsburgh I am definitely coming back!",

    "text": "My friend and I decided on a little preseason \"tailgating\" and came here for drinks and apps. As I walked in the door, I received some snobby looks from the host stand, but ignored it. The look was like \"what are you doing here\". Whatever. I found my friend at the bar and we caught up for a bit. It literally took them 8 minutes (I kept time) for them to acknowledge me and tell me the specials. After scanning the restaurant, I noticed some specials on their mirror from the other side of the room (no one told me about them). I ordered a peach and herbs drink (bourbon). The drink itself was good, but no real taste of peach, just bourbon. It was good, but I know I could've made a better one. My friend had a Southie she said was good.  We ordered the mussels with bread, fries and truffle aioli. Not kidding, about 1/2 my mussels were empty :( The bread was soggy and it wasn't from the broth. The fries were ok. I noticed they put all the long fries on top and left us with crumbs on the bottom. Really?   So my friend excused herself to the ladies room as I continued working to try and find a mussel with meat (the mussels were ok too, not fabulous). I'm not joking here...THREE PEOPLE asked if they could dump my empty mussel bowl...THREE PEOPLE! There were only like 4 more mussels to finish. I had to shoo them away. The guy sitting next to me even made a comment and I said this was something like a Seinfield episode (leave me to my mussels!). Lol!   FINALLY, I finished and they were so happy to take my empty mussel shells away. Wow, had you given me the attention upon my arrival, Meat and Potatoes, I might not have wrote this review.  All in all, Meat and Potatoes is like a really hot guy: yes, you're hot and nice to look at, but very shallow, snobby and conceited. Yes, their food is good, but you better pair that with outstanding service, which we did not receive. With you being in business for all this time and with other restaurants giving stellar service, you should know better by now, Meat and Potatoes-hence the 2 stars.",

After parking in the Theater Garage and being stuck in a downpour with no umbrella, we stumbled into Meat and Potatoes, and so glad that we did.  At 1030pm, there was still a 20 minute wait so we started with a drink at the bar. The whole establishment feels like a bourbon bar/speakeasy, and is unlike any other place we've ever been. While enjoying a drink at the bar, all three bartenders engaged us in conversation and made us feel right at home. We decided to order just a few small plates and eat at the bar.  We started with a short rib flatbread that was very unique and delicious. Next came the Devils on horseback. Being from Baltimore, we are accustomed to oysters, however these were served with dates. They were a little heavy for our taste, but very flavorful. The standout dish was their fried brussel sprouts. They were so crispy and crunchy, but still had their earthy sort of flavor. I would come back just for an order of those. The bartenders were also making gourmet cocktails with ingredients I had never even heard of. The speed well was right in front of us so we got to smell all of the drinks as they were being made.   Overall, a very unique atmosphere,great food, great drinks, and an amazing staff. They made us feel right at home and I would recommend this place to anyone.",

Flat iron is normally code speak for cheap piece of meat, but this was a one inch thick cooked perfectly meal. A negative:  your neighbor table is very close to you.",

    "text": "This is a review ONLY for the burger.  That's because I love burgers. I seek out good burgers. In fact, the other day I was told a good chef in Memphis (whose restaurants is allegedly not doing well) commented he would *never* put a burger on his menu. That's a really silly idea. There are people like me who travel for work and check yelp for a great local burger. People like me read reviews of good burgers and then travel specifically to the restaurant for the burger. Which of course adds to revenues and grows business.  Meat & Potatoes is trying very hard to be a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburgh. Located in a \"new\" building the restaurant was created to feel like it's been here for years. They focus like any gastropub on good food and good alcohol, using every part of the animal they can. I visited for lunch, not dinner, but the burger was of course on the menu.  This was a very good burger. Topped with caramelized onions, havarti cheese, tomato jam and arugula, the well-proportioned meat sat squarely between a freshly baked bun. The bun was out of this world. A bite was an explosion of flavors. I would absolutely come here again for the burger.  The fries were fine. Freshly cut, lots of salt, and served with a small serving of ketchup.   Four stars for a really good burger.",

    "text": "It seems like everyone in Pittsburgh is ranting and raving about Meat and Potatoes. I have half a mind to join them. However I feel like M&P is like that girl you pick up at 2 AM when the boozer is letting out. Things look great right then and there but looming back the next morning you are left thinking \"Weren't you prettier last night?\" This is my morning after wake up call.   We will start with the decor.  I like it. It's a cool modern take on the kind of look one gets in a classic pub. While this should lend to a warm inviting atmosphere, M&P is somehow able to make is feel cold and pretentious. Secondly, the tables are crammed in so tight big guys like me can end up feeling very cramped. On that note I would like to apologize to the poor people seated next to me on my last visit. The layout forced my butt in your dinner. Sorry.   The service can mirror the feel from time to time. Sometimes I get warm and friendly, other times its cold and unapproachable. Just because you work in a hot downtown location doesn't me you get to be a boor to your guests.   The major saving graces to M&P are the food and the cocktails. The food is killer. My go to favorites are the fried chicken livers (trust me) and the signature Meat and Potatoes for Two (I don't share. Fat guy remember?). Steaks always come out hot and perfectly cooked, but rested enough so they don't bleed out all over your plate. The bar is stellar too. They seem to trend toward updates on classic prohibition era cocktail is but they are done well. The drinks are very well balanced and tasty. Too easy to have too many tipples here.   To wrap up I like M&P. it's pricey but I the k it is worth it. The major issues I have with the place stems from their pretentiousness. They label themselves a \"gastropub\" which to me is entirely redundant. The word supposedly means a bar with great food. Ok you just described a \"pub\". The attitude follows with the decor and the attitude of the workers. It's like meeting this great girl at last call and in the morning you find out she is kinda bitchy. But she's definitely hot enough to call again.",

The entrees are, of course, delicious as well and the custom cocktails are wonderfully balanced and mixed, but hot damn, those are some good fries! This is a great place to take a date on a fancy (and expensive) dinner.  I keep trying to give it four stars in my head because I feel like I've been too liberal with my stars lately, but nope, I can't do it. As long as you're expecting to spend a lot on really good food, then this is perfect.  Endnote: one of the things on there is a GIGANTIC steak that two people can share.

The first course was the Smoked Brisket Mac and Cheese, the brisket was incredible moist and tender, pairing excellently with the creamer variation on this mac and cheese dish.   From there I went with the Leg of Lamb Steak. The cook on the steak was great. There was hardly trace of fat. I must say tho the star of the dish I would have to give the butternut squash caponata and bulgar wheat. The sweet taste of the squash with the hardiness of the wheat. There was just something about the pairing,  a bowl of it and I would have been quite content.   Which leaves me with dessert. I went with the oreo cream brownie. To be honest I only went with it because it was done differently than the usual mason jar filled dessert that there known for. That being said although any dessert I've had there has been great. I think they have come to shine when they step out of there normalcy and deconstruct something that makes me want to tell my friends and family about.

Had short ribs flatbread and Hudson Valley Duck Breast.  They had to switch it to some other type of duck that was even more tender, but the duck just melts in your mouth.  Again, the food was so rich, that it was hard to have so much.  I was really tempted by the mussels, but the only non-pork flavor they had was curry, and I wasn't in the mood for curry that night.

    "text": "I had my first Meat and Potatoes experience a few weeks ago as part of Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. My friend and I made reservations for a weekday and I basically spent that entire workday looking at the menu and salivating.  We decided to go with the prix fixe restaurant week menu, which had a fitting \"meat and potatoes\" theme for each course.  The first course was beef carpaccio with cute little crispy potato chips, arugula, quail yolk, and a taleggio foam. The carpaccio was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The portion was very generous, especially for an appetizer course. I would go back just to have this again.  Second course was grilled flank steak, potato gnocchi, and basil salsa verde. The meat was perfectly cooked--extremely tender and full of flavor. We loved the pillowy gnocchi, which were a delicious companion to the steak and the salsa verde. My friend and I both later agreed that this was our favorite course. The menu referred to this as a \"stew\" but I'm not sure I would use that word as I was picturing a hearty soup of some sort. Regardless, this dish was perfect and we loved it.  The third and final course consisted of crispy short ribs, pickled Swiss chard, baby carrots, and potato croquettes. Again, the meat was tender and packed with flavor. The crispiness of the fried croquettes added great texture, and it was nice to have the carrots and chard to add in some other flavors. This was served with a very rich gravy and overall had the feel of comfort food, elevated.   For an additional $20 or so, M&P offered a paired cocktail for each course. My friend and I had gone to happy hour prior to dinner so we decided against the three drinks (I wanted to actually remember the meal...) but we did each order a cocktail off the regular menu. We had a Clover Club and the Seven Year Itch, both of which were great. They had a nice selection of both classic and new craft drinks.  The restaurant itself has a nice, trendy vibe but doesn't go overboard. The staff was friendly and we didn't run into any service issues.  Overall this was a positive experience and I'm excited to go back. Based on other reviews, I think my next trip here will be for brunch. The words \"Bloody Mary bar\" are enough to draw me in!",

My husband and I shared the 45oz. steak and also ordered the Bernaise sauce and the AuGratin potatoes, all of which was terrific.  Our steak was cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth.  My husband also had the bone marrow appetizer, which everyone at our table enjoyed immensely.  Our meal was terrific.  Meat & Potatoes is a little pricey, but it was worth it.  We celebrated my husbands  birthday and our waitress Emily could not have been better.",

    "text": "Food and drink at Meat and Potatoes:  AMAZING. Service:  Interesting  I say that because I feel like there is a bit too much of an attitude from the hostess and sometimes from the bartenders.  I wanted to stop in for drinks before a show and when the hostess asked if I had a reservation, I said no, we just wanted to stop in for drinks.  She continued to inform me that they were a very popular establishment and it is important to make reservations.  I asked if we could just sit at the bar and was told yes, but that tables were just for those with reservations.  I clearly mentioned that I was going to the bar, there was no need for her to tell me several times that they are popular.  When we got in, the bar was completely empty except for two seats.  Most tables were empty as well, but I do understand that they might be if people were coming in for later reservations.  Service at the bar was friendly and efficient.  They gave recommendations on which drinks to try and also suggested some of their most popular items.  I love steak tar tar and was excited to see it on the menu.  It isn't east to find on a menu and even harder to find a good version.  Theirs is served with an egg on top, aioli drizzled around the sides and peanuts.  The unique additions made one of my favorite dishes even more tasty.  I ate it slowly because I wanted to savor every bite and was actually sad when I took my last forkful.  I can't wait to try this dish from them again.  I also had the poutine.  The price seems steep for an appetizer of french fries, but the portion size is quite large and everything about them was tasty.  For drinks I sampled the Delicious Sour.  It was a perfect blend of the ingredients and I would order it again.  On another visit, I had a very different experience at the bar.  I almost felt talked down to by the bar tender once I said I wasn't going to be having any drinks.  Every time they walked over they mentioned how they have such great specialty drinks, they are known for their drinks, etc.  I get that, but there are a lot of reasons a person someone might not want to drink, no need to be pushy.  They also seemed to want to rush me out.  I felt like I wasn't trendy enough to be sitting at the bar and they wanted me out to get someone else in who better fit their image.    Overall, a great place with amazing food.  Just be aware that you might get some snobby treatment and be reminded of how great the restaurant you are in is.",

    "text": "Damn, can this place do brunch! I've been to a number of brunch places around the Pittsburgh area and this one might well be my favorite.  Let's start with the ambiance. Perfect lighting, not too bright and not too dim. Great for those coming to eat to cure themselves of their hangovers. The music playing were those AWESOME 90s jams we all love and keep near and dear to our hearts (you know that Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, and Third Eye Blind!).  I went with 3 other friends and was seated at the bar and greeted by friendly bartenders. We ordered the following: shrimp and grits, 2 orders of chicken and waffles, and scrambled eggs with potato gratin. Oh and of course some mimosas and bloody Marys (because, duh, it's brunch).   I did not have the fortune of tasting the shrimp and grits but the friend who ordered it said, and I quote, \"I wish that never had to end\". So, I'm guessing it was pretty freaking good. The friend who received the scrambled eggs said they were the best he had ever had.  Now, onto the chicken and waffles. WOOWEE. These chicken and waffles gave meaning to my life. I had a reason to live. To love. To write this review. First, the chicken...the amount they gave us, you would've thought they gave us the whole damn farm! Like 4 HUGE pieces of chicken topped on a giant Jalapeno waffle (jalapeno in a waffle?! The future is now, people) with a side of bourbon-bacon maple syrup. This entire thing lasted me for at least another 2 meals. Talk about getting your money's worth!  Onwards to service! So friendly and nice. When they took our plates, you would've thought we were doing THEM a favor by having our plates removed. Bartenders were great, they talked to us, but not in a forced way and kept us entertained with their mixology while we waited patiently for our food.   Bottom line, this place is wonderful. All the hype Meat and Potatoes gets is honestly all True. What an excellent dining experience and quite affordable too (at least brunch was)! Highly recommend this place, whether or not you need a pick-me-up from an all night bender or just want a nice casual, but classy brunch. Definitely looking forward to returning here again!",

Occasionally, you'll wind up with a slightly inconsistent or unorganized bartender but that certainly doesn't speak to their whole staff. Besides waiting a bit to long for a drink from time to time the service has always been on point.  The food is impeccable with large portions.   Price may detract for some, but it's about where you should expect a gastropub in a Downtown area to be.   If you're a foodie it'll fall into your regular rotation. If you're a casual diner, save it for that special night. The service and atmosphere will help set the mood.",

We ordered the fried pickles, and I ordered the pot roast, which were both great. However this past time, the service of wasn't great, and I wasn't super impressed by the duck entree.

My husband and I were super excited to try their brunch menu, unfortunately it was Thursday and they only do that on weekends. A little bummed out, we were still going to try out their lunch menu because we already had our hearts set on a place. We got there, starving yet excited, only to feel extremely unwelcome by the very rude hosts. We kindly asked if there was outdoor seating available and the girl with long, black, frizzy/curly hair rolled her eyes, crumpled up the ticket that was already printed and dropped it on the desk while giving an annoyed look to the other host that was just sitting there slouching in her chair and then proceeded to walk us to the closest, probably most declined outdoor table instead of the beautiful patio on the side of the building. We didn't refuse it, we were hungry and didn't really care, we had the whole rest of the day to enjoy the city and the weather. But that experience lingered as we waited for our server, who probably didn't get told that we were sitting there. Unfortunately for our server who was pleasant and helpful, we left to find another restaurant where we would feel more welcome and get some brunch.",

You have four vodka choices, and then you add the toppings of your choice, such as fresh asparagus, celery, mushrooms, garlic, and multiple choices of hot sauce. There are plenty of breakfast cocktail options as well, and they are quite creative. I had a champagne cocktail with elderberry liqueur. Delish!  My friend had the omelette special that came with their signature au gratin potatoes. They were outstanding. I had the short rib hash, and I would go back again and again for that dish. The eggs were perfectly poached, and the short ribs literally melted in my mouth.  I love the atmosphere. Rustic with lots of wrought iron, yet modern. I can't wait to come back and try their signature chicken and waffles. I kept watching that dish go buy and my mouth kept watering even though I was already stuffed!  Our waitress was just ok, but honestly, I didn't even care because the food was so good.",

They had us in a small room off the bar which was nice, so we could talk easily to each other.  The decor was pretty amazing, I really liked the ambiance they were setting up. While, I did not order cocktails, most people in our group did.  The first person to get his drink, had a decent sized glass, which led everyone else to feel okay that theirs would be a decent size as well.  Unfortunately, that was not the case, the cocktails came in 3 different sized glasses, none of which were large.  I believe that was where most of the disappointment lied with our group for the evening.  Don't get me wrong though, everyone enjoyed the flavor of their drinks immensely, but they were overpriced for how much you got.     Just to say we did, we got the bone marrow appetizer, and while only half our table tried it, those that did seemed to enjoy it - I know I did.  I also ordered the waldorf salad, which was amaaazing.   As far as the meals went, they were fairly reasonably priced, but the portion sizes were pretty scattered.  I ordered the 3 little pigs sandwich and got a fat-heads sized sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered the pork - which was also massive.  No complaints on our end on flavor or size.  Unfortunately our friend ordered the salmon, and was disappointed in the size of his meal, and ended up finishing his wife's french fries (which were some of the best I've had in the city).  Everyone else got what I would deem, an appropriate sized meal, with no left overs, but also no hunger pains at the end.  Overall, a good meal was had by all",

My only complaint was there was more bacon than syrup, and after being charged  $1 for butter I wasn't too keen to be charged for syrup as well. The chicken was perfect, the waffle above average. The jalapeno waffle was good, but a bit undercooked and dry. Again, I could've asked for more syrup but out of principle resistance to being charged extra for a condiment I didn't request any.",

    "text": "Fantastic joint located in the Cultural District of Pittsburgh's Downtown area. I admit, I'm surprised that I put off coming to this place for so long. My friend and I ended up splitting a Meat & Potatoes for Two ($69), which included a 34 oz. ribeye steak meat cooked medium rare, confit steak fries, mushroom ragu, homemade steak sauce, and bone marrow gratin. I also ended up getting a devils on horseback as a small plate. Let's start with the main entree ... the steak meat for the ribeye was dope. Not only very tender, but also very flavorful especially with the homemade steak sauce, which gave the meat a more tangy flavor. Quantity of meat was abundant and even for two, it took my friend and I the entire meal to eat all that meat up. The confit steak fries were also not your average steak fries ... not soggy, but very crisp and tasty with seasoning (much appreciated). The bone marrow tasted like fat ... not sure if this is how it should taste (as this is the first time I've ever had anything like it), but it was very interesting indeed and I used it to coat a few of the steak fries that I ate. The mushroom ragu was great. Fresh, firm, and flavorful. The devils on horseback was tasty ... came in a small tray and I only got three. Not sure if the price on it was justified, but the taste was good. In general, a great place to go. Just go hungry and ready to eat meat!",

    "text": "We visited Meat & Potatoes last Saturday for a pre-dinner drink.  Upon arrival at 5:30pm, the restaurant AND bar were packed.  After making a circle around the bar to find seats, we went out to the hostess station to ask about a table.  Unfortunately, Meat & Potatoes was completely booked for the evening.  We really wanted to try at least something while we were there, so we went back to the bar.  I sat down at the only empty seat while my fiance stood next to me.    I asked the bartender (who looked amazing in the flannel shirt and cabby hat) for a drink suggestion.  Per my taste buds, he recommended the Vanilla Sky.  It tasted slightly tart with hints of anise and vanilla.  As a black licorice lover, I truly enjoyed this beverage!  My fiance got the 21st Amendment Back in Black.  We both really enjoyed our drinks and plan on returning to Meat & Potatoes - on a night we have made reservations.",

    "text": "I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I'm having trouble. I'll try to break down my thoughts about this place, but overall, I loved it! It's a unique place and very few restaurants in the city have a similar vibe or menu.  Atmosphere: Awesome! It's right downtown and in the midst of the cultural district happenings. It's also a little dark inside, but very eclectic, with a trendy, gastropub vibe and drawings of cows (which I enjoy).  Food: Here is where I love and also a little torn. I loved what I had, but I felt like there was a bit of an identity crisis involved. The food was eclectic, but also kind of random. They are called \"meat and potatoes\" but didn't really have the menu that reflected that name. Maybe that's meant to be the irony, for which case, they did fine. For example, if you wanted just a steak (I'm not a steak person, btw), then you'd have to order the steak offering that is for 2 people. You'd think that a simple option, like steak, is what this place would own. Otherwise, the mussels for an appetizer were great and I also loved my entree (but to be honest, I don't remember what I got now).  Service: Pretty decent, although our server seemed to be in a bad mood and the others around us seemed to have a server that enjoyed what they were doing. This may have improved the experience quite a bit.",

We ate at the bar as all tables were full. Great, great service. Yes the bar tenders are kind of this 'dork' trendy for the gastropub scene but they were quite knowledgeable about food and drink. If you were unsure about a draft beer they would give you a taste to see if it's what you wanted to go with.  Started with the pulled pork flatbread. YUM. Arugula, blue cheese, cheddar, horseradish, pickled onion - all delicious. My friend and I ate it up. I had the Salmon with black rice / kim chi / cucumber / korean hot sauce / chinese sausage / fried egg / ginger scallion relish. Mind blowing. I mean really, really creative dish. The salmon had crispy skin and that is the first time I've ever wanted to keep eating the skin. Everything just had a really great marriage of flavors. My friend had the hanger steak and was also impressed.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place! We decided to go to Pittsburgh on a whim for some shopping so I didn't do any research or make reservations anywhere in advance. After some lurking around Yelp, I decided I had to come here due to the sheer amount of great reviews, and c'mon, who doesn't love some meat and potatoes?!   When we got there (without a reservation) we were told that the restaurant was booked solid until 10pm. Sadly, we were about to leave when a space opened up for 2 in about 45 minutes! I was overjoyed! There's a separate lobby from the restaurant right outside with some nice comfy couches so we sat there and waited. Also, there's a small bar that's in the same building as the restaurant that featured live music on a stage. Next time I will research more wisely so I can do both.   The table ended up being open a bit earlier than expected so we were seated promptly. The ambiance of the restaurant was dimly lit without too much noise so it was perfect for a romantic dinner for 2, as was the case when I looked around, there were lots of couples out for a nice dinner together.   Our waitress was very nice and gladly answered all the questions we had in addition to making some great recommendations in regards to drinks - she knew her stuff! We settled on getting the deep fried chicken liver and mac and cheese to start followed by the 34oz ribeye steak with potatoes and bone marrow as an entree. Let me tell you, BIG MISTAKE because the starters were so rich and filling that we were already nearly full when the big entree came. Our eyes were far too big for our stomachs.   The chicken liver was delicious. It was battered and deep fried a bit rare, as the waitress had warned us it would be a bit pink inside. I wouldn't recommend it if you're squeamish with the idea of anything coming from a chicken being a bit rare. The mac and cheese was SO RICH and super CHEESY. It came with pulled pork and chorizo. The cheesiness was definitely there however there was barely any meat that I could notice.   Now, onto the big one. The 34oz ribeye was perfection (called \"meat & potatoes\" on the menu). It came on a cutting board that took up most of our table so we just ate straight of the board (channeling our inner caveman). The ribeye was perfectly charred, cooked medium rare with the (HUGE) bone in, and seasoned just right. It came with 2 sauces on the side for the potatoes. The bone marrow gratin was also quite good however I wish that they had provided a few pieces of crusty bread to eat it with. I ended up just using the potato to spread it on (is that what I'm supposed to do?). The potatoes were very crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. Unfortunately we were barely able to finish half of it so we had to get it to go.   Next time (there WILL be a next time) I think we'll just get the ribeye alone as it's more than enough for 2 people. They also have daily specials as well. When we went they had mussels 3 different ways that was very popular. Nearly every table ordered them!  It's been a few weeks since we've returned to Toronto but I still think about this amazing meal! I'll be back!!",

He advised I order another dish, especially since this would be new for me. I went with the bone marrow and Caesar salad, which consisted of romaine, pickled green tomatoes, crispy pig ears, chicharrones, fried egg, and parmesan. Most of the ingredients in the Caesar were also unfamiliar to me.  My meal was excellent.

The hot sauce variety is the best I've ever seen. -The Strawberry or Peach Bellini. -Fried taters with truffle aioli. Shut the front door. I wish I could eat this dish every day.   The experience: We had a group of 12 so we reserved the side room. To be expected, it's a bit loud but a must-have if you are attending with a large group. Our service was excellent. The waiter knew each dish, made perfect recommendations and was quick to notice when our beverages got low. The food runners we're also speedy and professional. We had one small incident with a loose coffee lid and a bit of hot brew landing on the back of my date but it was handled well and certainly didn't ruin our time there.   Food: I ordered the Shrimp & Grits, most of the table ordered the short rib hash (it's the most popular brunch item) and the rest of the dishes included the Pub burger, Bi Bim Bap, Huevos Ranchero, Eggs in purgatory and Chicken and Waffles. The Chicken and Waffles portion size made everything else seem like an appetizer! I thought that seemed a little inconsistent but that's not a huge complaint, I needed a to-go box for my meal and it was half the size! No major issues with any of the food. A bit of hot sauce needed for a few of the dishes but that's more personal preference than a stab at the quality of the food. I found my dish to be very rich, part of the reason I had to take the rest home. The flavor was wonderful, I only mention how rich it is so my fellow yelpers are aware.   The dining experience at Meat & Potatoes for lunch and dinner has long held a superb reputation and I am happy to report that their brunch experience is no different! You will not be disappointed!",

Our server started a little slow but gave excellent recommendations. Each menu selection was perfect, including two of the beverages we enjoyed- Goose Island 321, and a featured Watemelon Draft I forgot the brand.. The truffle risotto appetizer for $14 was my entree- I do not have a large appetite but it was more than enough for me and to share. Perfectly prepared-to die for! I would recommend it as a side to share for normal diners! It was beautiful visually, the aroma, the taste, and texture...perfection! The Wagu steak $31, served with sauteed mushrooms was one of the other entrees I tasted and was also great! The steak was beautifully tender and cooked to perfection. The third entree was also a winner- the paperdelle with short rib and Bolognese sauce. It was light and the noodles handcut, there were generous meat chunks  that were fork-tender. The atmosphere is uncluttered,  hip, urban- upscale, but the prices don't break the bank. I think this is one our best treats of the city in the cultural disrict.",

    "text": "I'm going to give Meat and Potatoes 3.5 stars here.  Before I start my review, I just want to say that there was unusual event that happened while we were dining that I'll try not to affect this review.  There was an altercation at the bar area, which almost ended up in a fight.  It disrupted the whole restaurant and after the culprit was removed from the restaurant, it took someone in my party twice to ask the manager to call the police (the culprit was just standing outside the restaurant) because maybe the manager thought he was kidding the first time? Nonetheless, it didn't ruin the evening and our waiter said in his 2 years working there, nothing like that had ever happened.  Back to the actual review...  I've wanted to go to Meat and Potatoes for as long as I've known they had the 34 oz. ribeye.  The restaurant was somewhat dark and the bar takes up most of the space in the middle of the room, but I've never sat in a more comfortable chair while dining out.  There's an extensive drinks menu, so you'll definitely be able to find something that works for you.  To start, our table got the fried chicken livers, the lobster mac and cheese, and the pierogies.  It was my first time trying chicken livers and they were delicious, as was the mac and cheese (which had a doritos crust that was really surprisingly good).  The pierogies tasted fine, but were cold so we asked the waiter to heat them up and they came back cold again, which was the main negative of the meal and the reason why I didn't give a full 4 stars.  For the entree, I split the ribeye for two with a party member.  It was exactly like how I envisioned it.  Cooked exactly like how we wanted and the flavor was unbelievable.  It came with potato wedges and bone marrow, which were delicious as well.  Just a heads up, though (which I didn't know until we ordered), that the ribeye for two takes up to an hour to cook.  We weren't in any rush, so that was fine and it obviously makes sense because it's a massive piece of meat.",

Wings weren't too hot and I've never had better fries in my life! I personally got the three little piggy sandwich and it was the best out of everyone else's meal. It's more like a yummy breakfast sandwich with s runny egg, thick cut bacon, and ham. It also came with fries. I loved it! The others at my table got a variety of different items.

The steak selection was minimal but I ended up getting the lamb meatballs with pasta. The flavors were very strong but tasty. It became quite rich about half way through. The drink menu seemed extensive and they had some cool craft beers on tap. The vibe was upscale/trendy. A DJ started performing around 9ish (on a Monday night) which I didn't expect. The restaurant turned slightly into a club which I wasn't in the mood for. Prices were reasonable.",

Glancing at their dinner menu, I feel like I could probably come, if I were in the mood for some serious carbs (the vegetarian options are a little limited).   Anyway, the Bruschetta is amazing - that chimichurri is magical. I really, really enjoy it. I also very much love the bloody mary bar, a $7 build-your-own sort of deal. They have 6ish flavored vodkas in rotation (my favorite is old bay), and then you go get your mix and all the toppings you want. And these are serious toppings: ~20 kinds of olives, 10 kinds of pickles, antipasti of all kinds, stuffed grape leaves, etc.  Sort of an appetizer in its own right.  The portion size for food varies widely - the Bruschetta is just the perfect amount, whereas the chicken and waffles looks like it could feed 4 people. You may want to ask before ordering or look around you.  I often see people waiting to be let in, sometimes angrily. However, they take reservations! You don't even have to call that far in advance if there's only a few of you. Just a tip, so that you're not left out among the hangry people.",

I ordered a Bloody Mary and the Benedict of the day, my fiance ordered a Bloody Mary and the huevos rancheros. About 10 minutes later we saw our food come out, but they tried to give it to another table. 5 minutes later, they finally brought it to us. We had yet to receive our glasses to take to the Bloody Mary bar, so we had to ask again (we were seated by the bar and could see our glasses full of vodka and ice just sitting there melting). I tried my food before heading to the bar and it was ice cold. I hate complaining, but it was inedible. They took it back and continued to apologize profusely. Once I got my food back, my fiance was finished with his (I told him to keep eating so his wouldn't get cold). It would have been nice to have been able to eat together. They didn't even take anything off of the bill.   It is upsetting because we were looking forward to coming here and even saved it for a special occasion, but the service wasn't great and my food was cold and they didn't do anything about it but apologize.   It is an expensive place to not have a perfect experience. Because of that I don't know if we will ever be back.",

The bone marrow was delicious (think beef flavored butter) and the first time I'd had this. Requested that the steak be cooked to medium and it was and was just delicious. They were excellent with fitting in my son, who is a toddler and the waiter was very friendly toward him. This restaurant isn't the largest, I do not think I would recommend it for a large crowd as it has open air and very little space between you and others. It wasn't especially loud or anything, but I wouldn't personally bring a big group here. Food was served up amazingly fast. HIGHLY recommend reservations because this place isn't large and there was a long wait if you didn't have reservations.",

The Squid Ink Pasta had a great texture and chew to it, and none of the \"seafood-y\" taste, smell, or grittiness. Lots of fresh seafood and a great tomato sauce to finish! Very impressed. I thought that the Steak and Frites would be your typical thinnish-strip steak, but the steak we received was thick, cooked perfectly, and super tender. The frites were very, very salty.  We also tried the Bone Marrow (described at \"meat butter\") by the staff, and it came with grilled bread, gremolata and pickled onions. It was a bit too fatty and greasy for me, and I wasn't a particular fan, but I had to try it since I was there. The Fried Brussel Sprouts were less impressive- super salty and the sprout leaves weren't that crisp as I've seen at some other restaurants. Lemon aioli was good.  The Smoked Brisket Mac and Cheese was fine- nothing particularly stood out to me, and if I were to return, I would try something else.   In general, service was fine. We enjoyed the Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites, though they are not on the regular menu. Overall, a lot of the dishes were on the salty side.",

We started off with a couple appetizers; fried pickles and chicken livers. The pickles were a hit. The chicken livers, not so much. The sauce for the livers didn't go well with the livers and while it may be a personal alternative taste, it's something we have liked at other establishments.   We had the oysters rockefeller, chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger for dinner. The oysters were a hit. The chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger were a miss and primarily for the same reason.  The chicken and burger both lacked seasoning.  The chicken batter was seasoned but the chicken itself while well cooked was bland. The burger was perfectly cooked but again little if any seasoning created a bland tasting burger.  We were a bit disappointed after the reviews and hype.   Pittsburgh has no lack of great food. Time to  move on to the next one and we hope that our feedback will inform small adjustments to improve the exoerienc.  The dipping sauce for the livers didn't go too well with the livers but on",

I haven't always been the biggest advocate as I've had some awful experiences but kudos to you them as of late.  For as nauseating as the whole Edison bulb, overly hip architecture that has sprouted across Pittsburgh, it works well here. They bartenders are skilled, and the best part, they are actually pleasant. Which is more than I can say about a lot of similar establishments. We stuck with beer and some simple Old Fasions, but I was memorized watching them work as we were sitting at the bar.  Frankly, I could come here and just eat from the snacks menu, but we decided on some appetizers with the bone marrow and tartare. Both were exquisite, just the right amount, and made up for any past transgressions from previous visits.  For dinner, I had a plain Jane burger, and it was exactly what I was craving. Cooked medium rare and didn't even need condiments which I rarely find myself saying. Fries, were as expected, very good and presumably cooked in duck fat. Although that's just a guess on my part.  To date the only issue is getting a table or at least, getting reservations. I'm sure it's a stressful job judging by be need of 2-4 hostesses every night but they don't always handle things well. I arrived right around 5PM on a Friday and got two seats at the bar no problem. Amazingly, the place was fairly dead until 6PM.  Confusing as we couldn't get reservations, but we were able to get in so it all worked out.",

HOWEVER, regarding the hostess(es):  Don't expect the hostesses to be accommodating or helpful when trying to make same-day call-ahead reservations.   I understand that such a successful establishment is not hurting for business, but the hostesses were rude and pretentious when simply asked about seating a party of 6. \"We can't accommodate a party that large.\" Done. No further explanation, no attempt to resolve.   Um, ok? I'm a very patient person. \"So then what do you recommend for a larger party (which I don't consider a party of 6 as \"large\" but I suppose it is a smaller restaurant)... \"There are some other restaurants nearby.\" ---- WHAT? I'm sure management would love to hear how well-trained they are to handle *difficult* questions/situations from the hangry brunch crowd.   Fortunately we were able to make a reservation for 4 (two of our party decided it was not worth the hassle) through the app. Clearly I was hell-bent on dining at this establishment.  Final conclusions:  1) Make reservations far in advance. Fortunately you can do that through the Yelp! App.  2) If you plan to walk in and wait, you better not have over 4 people in your party. If so, just take your business elsewhere because they so obviously do not need yours. In fact, they'll gladly share with others.  3) While hostess service left a bad taste, every other aspect was worth the wait-time. Polite, knowledgable and attentive servers. Delicious food.",

Just sad you have to book so far in advance to get seated at a decent dinner time but definitely worth it.  This is a must.  Moscow Mules were out of this world.  Ceasar Salad was authentic and lemony.  Staff was very laid back and catered to your needs.",

One bartender asked another to take our order, which he did followed up by \"It's going to be a while for your cocktails\" in a very rude tone as if we kicked their dog or spit in their face (which we did not).  The bar back was incredibly gracious and very nice, wish we could have ordered from him.  The Pork Chop I would highly recommend, Fred Flinstone would have been envious.  Bone in, huge, cooked perfectly......I actually lucked out ordering.  Couldn't dare ask the server for a recommendation, which I usually prefer since they have insider info. The server came up and smirkily said \"what do you want\" as if we insulted his family (Again, which we did not).    Service - F Food - A++  It'll be a while if ever before we go back though, poor service creates a poor experience regardless of how good the food is.",

We have truffle fries (amazing), wings, fried pickles, and Brussels sprouts. All were really good. We should.have stopped there. Then I ordered the steak.

    "text": "How has this place been open for two years and I haven't been there yet!    There was honestly not one bad thing about this visit.  From the amazingly interesting and tasty drinks to the perfectly plated duck, I really need to go back - now.  Our trip there was my birthday lunch and since I was not going back to work, bring on the drinks.  I started with the glenshaw sour and was a bit disturbed by the egg whites that it contained, but all of my fears were alleviated with that first frothy lemony sip.  I followed that up with a brandy buck - how many birthday lunches does a person get?  Applejack brandy and pungent ginger were a perfect combination.  M had the thai steak salad that was piled high with thin strips of skirt steak.  It looked amazing.  J had the mussels.  It might have been the biggest pile of mussels I have ever seen - and we eat a lot of mussels.  The pancetta in the sauce definitely differentiated these mussels from others around town.  I had the duck.  Perfectly medium rare duck slices over spaetzle with massive saurkraut pierogies.  I was in heaven.  We finished it off with some of the creamist creme brulee I have ever had.   Awesome birthday lunch.  Can't wait to go back for brunch, dinner, more lunch, drinks....",

Libations:  I had the El Segundo, which is sweet but you can smell the jalapeno floating on the drink with each sip. Truly delicious! I also stole a sip from my friend's Up in Smoke which was equally good, despite having whiskey which I am not a fan of. I decided to be good and stick to just one drink since I had to drive home.   Snacks: We had the ahi tuna, fried chicken livers, devils on horseback and poutine. My fave was the ahi tuna, but I just love raw fish! Everything was truly deletable, the poutine was an experience.   Dinner: I got the braised lamb shank and that night instead of the polenta, they were serving beans and greens with bacon. Mmm, who doesn't like bacon? the lamb shank was oh-so-good! the portion sizes here are huge, I stuffed my face and had enough leftovers to stuff my face again for lunch.  Service/Atmosphere: Service was good, nothing to complain. The place is busy, which I love. Love the energy there!  We couldn't have done dessert even if we wanted to. I almost had to be rolled down the street to home. Happily rolled.",

When we came - the hostess knew us immediately. lol We were seated right away. Our drinks were fabulous. My fiance got the Bambles drink & I got something that I can't remember it's name but was good .... Appetizers --we got fried pickles - delicious! AND... we got bone marrow... I know that's a really weird app combo - but whatever - it was divine. My fiance got the pub burger which he loved, except he wasn't feeling the pork patty on the burger. I got the salmon with an asian flavor infusion with a fried egg. I know that sounds also -- very odd but I am not addicted & cannot CANNOT wait to go back to have that salmon dish again as soon as humanly possible. It was epic in my mouth good. A MUST to order.

    "text": "Overall: An excellent lunch and dinner experience. The service accommodating, the drinks well-balanced, and the food savory, if slightly rich. An easy choice for Pittsburgh fine-dining. __________________________________________ Ambiance (4/5): One room and large, so it doesn't get to \"chill\", but otherwise very relaxed, festive, and modern, if a little chatty from the other guests and expansive from the very-large bar.  one room and a small private table with door, industrial feel with pipes and low-power lights hanging from the high ceilings above. bar of 20. high ceilings, rustic wall mounts of deer heads, greens hang from lights for Christmas, tree lit in corner. Soft ambiance play from above, hum to the place. __________________________________________ Service (4/5): Prompt, if stand-off, arguably \"know it all\" in delivery, but exceptionally accommodating during lunch and overall very genial and helpful.  Immediate water and refills, long list of suggestions with general portion sizes indicated. Recommendations were as described. Took a bit of time delivering between appetizers though restaurant fairly packed.  I returned for lunch the next day.. 35 minutes after the kitchen had closed! I placed an order at 1:55, they cooked it and put it at the bar. It was still warm, waiting, when I arrived at 2:35. I never felt rushed sitting down this late, and they accommodated me perfectly. __________________________________________ Drinks (5/5): Mixed drinks have a fantastic balance of flavor, alcohol, and texture. Small craft beer selection.  1) sloe gin fizz - awesome lightness with gin and citrus, juniper a bit lost but consistency creamy with egg. Fantastic stuff.  2) Sgt peppers old fashioned - bitters and orange work well together, pull out bourbon oak and heat while tempering. Pepper keeps drink light, very low sugar presence compared to sometimes over sweetened profile. One of the best old fashioneds I've drank. Another winner! __________________________________________ Food (4/5): Aside from a few textural shortcuts and missteps, this is excellent cuisine, both lunch and dinner. Rich and hearty yet balanced and inventive, I look forward to trying another round.  1) tartare - spicy from the chili bowl-glaze and Jalapeno crunch! Soft boiled egg sits atop (done perfectly). Seaweed definitely noticeable. Light onion as well. Quality meat, lighter smoke unnoticeable unless you separate from fixins. Peanut adds a distinguished crunch though the flavor contrasts a bit. Lighter, more conflicted from so many ingredients, not as rustic or simple. I prefer softer texture of bittering agents like arugula, black pepper, and capers to the harsher texture here, and the spice heat slightly hides meat, but very good stuff.  2) Bone marrow - rich, fatty melt in mouth, nice use of salt, white onion, caper to cut richness though still a lot. Bread is hearty, absorbs marrow easily, but could be a bit crisper, though richness may overpower otherwise and sopping marrow out of bone is made easier. The coarse sea-salt is a textural issue against the marrow. It's gritty and cracks as the marrow melts in your mouth while you attempt chewing the bread.  3) Tort sandwich - really crunchy bread. Light! Avocado cuts jalapeno sting, pork fat, radishes maintain levity. Waves of flavor, first light jalapeno and pickled radish, then brash mango aioli and avocado, light pork and smoke following as spice builds, before the toasty crunch finish. Really subtle, in control. Lightly dry without aioli.  4) Mac and cheese - served in mini cast iron! thick! Lightly sweet, little burnt aspect so low textural contrast. Light influence from chorizo, hearty lightly stinging. Really solid and rich, though texturally a bit boring. She agreed.. \"thick, rich\"..",

The food was okay but the dining experience was hampered by the slow service. All in all it took almost FOUR HOURS to get all our food. Lest you think we ordered everything on the menu, we ordered the following:  Mussels, Fried pickles, Poutine, Grilled Bread, Devils on Horseback, and the Bone marrow.  The food has definitely improved since our first dining experience. The mussels were very tasty, and I definitely enjoyed the poutine. The grilled bread came with a very good strawberry rubharb jam. A word of warning about the bone marrow, it is well executed but the individual bones have little in each (compared to most places that serve bone marrow).  All in all, a good dining experience if you're looking to spend the evening. If you've got a show to catch you might want to head elsewhere.",

The hostesses were rude and I'm not sure if they were stoned or just worried about what their hair looked like, but they could have given two sh*ts about us being there. We had a reservation but arrived earlier to see if we could get in. Yeah, not sure they even spoke English. Bar was full, we were 'stalking' some folks about to leave until this 4-some came in, walked right in front of us. Bartenders never ack'd us. Overall, just a rude group of people. I'd like to try again next time. Maybe they'll get some more competent help.",

    "text": "Meat and Potatoes is a yearly tradition for me and my Steeler friends when we come in from Columbus, OH for a football game. We have been doing it for the past 3 years and unfortunately this visit on 11/13 was a complete disaster. I went to the bar to grab a drink while we waited for our table and my GF went to the bathroom. I hadn't realized that my birthday a few weeks ago was also the date that my ID expired and was denied bar service. As a 30 year old I was a bit annoyed, but didn't voice any displeasure since in reality I was in the wrong and the bartender was just doing her job. When my GF came back from the bathroom I explained the situation to her and told her to go ahead and grab a drink. She attempts to order, but is told that she better not be caught handing me her drink and instead of having her drink made the bartender goes and talks with the manager. Eventually the bartender returns and serves her drink WITHOUT ID'ing her. You would think my younger GF would get her ID checked by the bartender who just made a whole scene about an expired ID. Still, not enough to get us to leave because we want our Rib-Eye. The manager Matt assumed that after all of this we would want a free appetizer, not really, but still a respectable gesture. We are sitting around enjoying our appetizer and I'm sucking on the ice cubes from my GF's EMPTY Bourbon drink when all of a sudden I have the manager rip the glass out of my hand while it's in my mouth. I didn't want to cause any type of scene inside the restaurant and ruin anyone's experience, so I asked Matt if I could have a calm word in the Lobby about what was going on and why I was being harassed. I tried to ask him a couple questions about the situation in the lobby and instead was interrupted and after about 2 minutes was told by Matt \"I don't have time for this, maybe the cops will if you would like them called\" I responded \"that wasn't necessary, but I'm sure they would have loved to hear how his bartender didn't card my GF who was clearly under 30. I wanted to stay because the food is so good, but my friends were just as uncomfortable about the way I was treated as I was. We told our server that we wanted charged for our Appetizers so we could leave her tip and not ruin her night as well. I had made these reservations 3 months in advance and it really sucks that we were treated so horribly. I understand a liquor license is each establishments most valued possession, but I was doing absolutely nothing to try and endanger it. If I had just one piece of advice for management it would be to listen and understand the complete situation instead of assuming and jumping to conclusions. I will never be back or spend a dime at this establishment ever again.",

    "text": "At long last, after years of hearing about this place, I had the chance to eat a meal at Meat & Potatoes. And it didn't disappoint!  The atmosphere in here is really quite interesting - while the place definitely has the look of a modern and comfortable dining area there's lots of little inclusions in decor that make you think about shopping for fresh meat from your local butcher shop. It's kind of hard to describe and has to be seen to be understood, but rest assured, the place looks wonderful and inviting.  But let's be honest, the food is what really matters here! Meat & Potatoes is well-known for serving delicious food. And, well, they do! If you want a great appetizer, go for their grilled bread, which tastes like homemade toasty goodness, especially once you add on the fresh butter and jam that comes with it. As for the main courses, my friend had their special fish tacos (made with tilapia) and I went for a good ol' lamb burger. And yes, both were quite excellent! Something about the ingredients used in them gave what could potentially be considered standard menu fare a unique flavor. My lamb burger for instance had harrisa aioli, arugula and havarti, among other things, rather than the usual onions, American cheese slice, etc. - and the result was delicious perfection. Oh, and the burger? Cooked medium, exactly how I asked! So many places overcook my orders that having a tender, juicy, perfectly cooked burger in front of me was more or less a little piece of Heaven for me.  Not only is the food excellent here, but the service is wonderful! The waiters and waitresses are really attentive here. Have empty plates in front of you? Someone will soon clear them away. Do you have a show to go to that night? They'll make a note of that and get your order out ASAP. I really got the impression that they cared about our dining experience and it elevates Meat & Potatoes in my eyes.  So if you have such wonderful things to say, why only give this place 4 stars, I hear you asking? Well...because this place is LOUD. Like, even on a slow Wednesday night, between the loud music and the people talking here, the noises levels here got quite high. I would NEVER want to be here on a Friday or over the weekend, honestly.  Still, I'd definitely come back - the food and service really are both quite excellent. And given their prices (not super high but not cheap either) I think in my book this is a great location to keep in mind for special nights out with friends or dates. And who knows? Maybe I'll eventually find the energy to brave the noise and crowds and try their brunch - which I hear is also fabulous!",

    "text": "I have to say that since moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, I've been disappointed with the restaurants I've tried so far. Philly made me a total food snob, which happens easily when you can eat any cuisine at any time on any street corner and have a great meal, whether it's $10 or $50. I know, I know there are great places in Pittsburgh and everyone tells me I just haven't been to the \"right\" places yet.  Meat & Potatoes was one of those places! My faith in Pittsburgh food is restored. This was easily the best meal I've had here and definitely up there for one of the best meals I've had anywhere. From my phone call making reservations to dessert, we had an amazing experience here.  I called to make reservations and was connected with Matthew, who was extremely helpful and very pleasant! I had to call back soon after to make changes due to a change in our party number and he was overall very accommodating.    We arrived a bit before our reservation and got drinks at the bar. They have a nice selection of beers, some drafts and then an extensive bottle selection. It was quite crowded, so we took our drinks out to the lobby where there are large, comfy couches and tables to wait for our table.   When we were seated, we were introduced to Josh, who was a magnificent server and made our meal very enjoyable! He took great care of us throughout the night, from making sure we had everything we needed to making menu suggestions at our request.  Everything was delicious. We started with the Curry Mussels and Wild Mushroom Risotto. They were a great indication of the quality of the food we were going to have and we could not stop raving about it. The risotto was creamy and cooked perfectly. I am a huge fan of Mussels and loved something other than the traditional red or white sauce. Curry, coconut milk, lemongrass...YUM!  Each of us ordered a different entree and shared so we could sample everything. I could not have been happier with my selection. I ordered the Agnolotti pasta. It had pecorino romano cheese, greens, sweet potatoes and a maple bourbon foam. I was intrigued right away. A sweet, savory pasta dish that was definitely one of the most delicious and unique I had ever tasted. I am to stop myself from devouring it just so I could savor the leftovers!  The other dishes were equally as delicious! (Some of the best steak I've ever had.) Pappardelle pasta with bolognese sauce, short rib, pancetta and pork shoulder Wagyu Flat Iron with heirloom cherry tomatoes, pickled jicama, wasabi mashed potatoes Hanger Steak with pulled potatoes, romesco,  water cress, green onions, jalapeno vinaigrette  Oh and it didn't stop there. We decided to indulge in dessert because we knew it would be amazing. We shared an Eggnog pot de creme and a chocolate mousse that were both out of this world!!  I will definitely be going back because there were other menu items such as the Korean Reuban and  Lamb Burger that definitely caught my eye as well!",

It was a Tuesday night and it was packed, so have a reservation. The decor is very interesting and edgy.  So anyway, our server tells us the specials. He describes a steak that sounds good, I say I want that. The other steaks on the menu are $25-30 so I figure it's something around that. I get the steak, it's amazing, every bite melts in my mouth. The potatoes with it are also delicious (though I wish there had been more, there was basically a decorative amount of potatoes). Then we split a baked chocolate mousse for dessert which was equally delicious. Service was excellent and attentive throughout.  Then we got the bill. That damn amazing steak was $56. $56! $56!!! I had to laugh (to keep from crying). Now, I'm a frugal person, and I usually don't fall for well-known consumer trickery tactics like the \"special with no price\" but they caught me off guard on this particular night since my husband had encouraged me to \"go with the flow\" after I had lamented the $12 cocktails we ordered earlier at a nearby bar. Here I was trying to carpe the diem and I end up picking the most expensive dish in the world. HA!  I'm just glad it really was the best steak I ever had.",

As soon as we walked in the front door I could tell that it was going to be a great dining experience. The minute you walk in you're greeted by a friendly group of hostesses, and the friendly service doesn't end there.   Our waiter, Brent was wonderfully attentive, friendly and constantly checking up on us. My girlfriend and I shared the Macaroni and also the Fried Pickles, both were delicious. For our entrees I had the Duck Breast and she had the Pappardelle, even though neither one of us cleared our plates we were still beyond happy with our meals.   Meat & Potatoes is one of those places that you can't say anything bad about, at least I can't. The staff, the food, the atmosphere A+! I can't wait to go back.",

The poutine appetizer was a real disappointment. After having poutine for the first time earlier this year in Toronto, Canada, I was looking forward to see and try Meat & Potatoes' take on the dish. What ended up coming to the table looked more like wanna-be gourmet cheesy fries than actual poutine.   Definitely would come back for the mussels, skipping the appetizers.",

    "text": "4 years and 700 reviews later..  This place is still awesome.  This is coming from the picky, non-beef/pork eater who can find a few items to love--think grilled cheese with chicken skin cracklin and truffle, whaaa!  The place itself is really open with a massive bar smack dab in the middle.  It's done in a more airy, classic style, especially compared to its train wreck Butcher sister. It's also exactly what you expect, topped with Edison bulbs, large, plush chairs, and the clean-lined bar top.  Not nearly as stuffy as it definitely could have been.  The most recent adventure to Meat and Potatoes was for brunch.  +1 called for reservations (make reservations, really), showed up, and we were immediately seated in the crawl space for parties of two along the wall.  I clearly first got my seasonal bellini on, which at the time was some type of pineapple. Ooooh, damn. There's also the bloody mary bar which everyone raves about; if my nebbing skills are anything, it did look a bit extensive and cool.  I, of course, ordered the french toast. Sugar bread and booze! It's brunch! But this french toast was different.  Sourdough but tender, served in a huge bowl, topped with almond brittle. It was almost caramelized and incredible.  Enough to almost make me forget the starter of granola and fruit.  The pile of goodness was topped with honey and a sweet ricotta I still can't get over.  The guy inhaled his huevos ranchero, but allowed me to carefully remove a pile of egg, salsa, and black bean that was just spicy enough for all the flavor it gave. Pair that with the roasted pork it was served with, and +1 actually cleared his plate.  Okay, so maybe I didn't have meat nor potatoes, but it shows how anyone can get into the newer wave of frou frou downtown dining with the original.  It's the only logical place to start (with a bellini or two).",

Each time we have had less than great service but we were always happy with our drinks and food so we let it slide.  However, today we showed up for our brunch reservation and waited ten minutes to be acknowledged by a server and then another twenty minutes with no drinks or explanation for why our drinks (a Bellini and vodka for the Bloody Mary bar) were taking so long. After thirty five minutes of waiting - we made a reservation at a neighboring restaurant and left.  There are too many great restaurants in Pittsburgh now to deal with the less than stellar service you will find at Meat and Potatoes.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one!",

We had a reservation (highly recommended, as the space is small and popular) and were seated relatively quickly. We each ordered something different and passed plates:  -Brisket and Eggs: Delicious, the meat was a little tough, but the kimchi made up for it.  -Irish Benedict: Hearty but a bit bland. It also was really heavy. Definitely the least favorite.  -Short Rib Hash: Pretty good, is a somewhat small portion but apparently was filling  -French Toast: Absolute perfection. It was a bit sweet but all of the flavors worked well together.  -Omelet Special (Sundried Tomato, Cheese Curds, Roast Beef)-Pretty good, but the real star was the potato gratin that came on the side. That was divine.  We also decided to share 3 desserts. They were small so it worked out:  -Black Bottom Chocolate Pecan: The presentation was awesome-it came in a jar with whipped cream on top! It was really warm and rich. Definitely delicious, but probably couldn't have eaten one by myself.  -Pumpkin Tarte with Cranberry Sauce-Yum! Very festive and not too heavy. It was also less sweet which was pretty good considering the other 2 desserts.  -Mudslide Tiramisu: Light, flavorful and just great. This was probably the table's favorite. I would definitely order this again, no matter the time of the year.  All in all, Meat and Potatoes was a delicious treat, and  I hope to go back soon!",

It's mainly reservation only but you can always wait a 10-20 minutes and they'll seat you at the bar if nothing is available, which is delightful. I've tried the Irish Benedict and Short Rib Hash. Both amazing but I like the Benedict better for brunch. The short rib hash is unbelievably flavorful in a amazing way. The eggs are always poached to perfection and hollandaise on both is superb.",

From the soft shell blue crap sandwich to the smoked pork chop everything has always been amazing. The service has always been spot on. The interior is a modern American with a steak house feel. The drinks are well crafted and never disappointed me or who ever I have fine with. The desserts are always good. Some better then others but always good. Just keep in mind to always call and make a reservation before trying to get a table. It's always booked the day of I find. I learned that the hard way one time. Also the lunch and dinner menu do not have the same items on them so always double check that before picking a time. The only issue I have had with this place was when I walked in and they said they could seat us in an hour. An hour later we come back and that changed to 3 hours. At that point I would rather of been told that they never could of sat us. So I repeat. Always call ahead!",

The whole patio was open, but we were asked to wait 15-20 for a table or be sat at the bar. My friend and I picked the bar, and found maybe a dozen other tables empty - weird. But, I am not an expert on the seating process there so who's to say?  Staff was friendly and the bloody mary bar looked off the chains. Good spot overall.",

If you don't make reservations at least a month in advance, then I suggest you arrive a half hour before they open to get your name on a list for seats at the bar. And sitting at the bar is super convenient because it's right beside the Bloody Mary bar. There are tons of pictures on here of this bad boy, and I saw several people taking pictures to show friends and family, but let me say, none of them does this Bloody Mary bar justice. You could seriously just order the bar and make a meal out of all the amazing toppings that are on the bar. (Don't do this though, people will probably sneer at you). But seriously it's fantastic! My only issue is that the mix to make the actual drink was really lacking in any flavor. It may have truly been just tomato juice as the Worcestershire, Tabasco, etc were all available on the bar. I was a little disappointed. At least make me a delicious bass that I can add a little or a lot of spice to and then lots of toppings. I'm all for a little DIY but let's draw the line somewhere. Now a not about the chicken and waffles. They are delicious, no doubt about it, but it is HALF OF A CHICKEN. No lie. Half of the entire chicken. I burst out laughing when they brought the plate out. I had enough leftover for 4 more meals (but not enough of that delish syrup!) so be forewarned.",

    "text": "The Captain and I came to Pittsburgh for a weekend on official MOH duties and, naturally, I turned to Yelp to discover what restaurants awaited us. Meat and Potatoes was the most reviewed restaurant AND half a mile from our hotel so this seemed like the obvious place to go.  The restaurant is nice inside - it has this hipster butcher vibe going on. It's unfortunate that it was just the Captain and myself because there were a lot of items on the menu I'd have liked to try. But alas, we could only order what our stomachs could handle. I went with the bone marrow appetizer and the Captain got the mussels. The bone marrow was well prepared and, if I may say, a rather large portion. Of course, this was probably meant to be shared but ... my fat ass ate it all. The portion comes with 3 pieces, about 6 slices of grilled bread, and is accompanied with gremolata, pickled onions, capers, and salt flakes. Don't shy away from this menu item (unless you're on a diet ... and I should be).  For my entree I selected the duck served with spaetzel. What a disappointment. I ordered it medium rare and it arrived as such but it tasted like ... nothing. Bland, dull ... completely void of anything that would make me pause to appreciate its flavor. My husband got the wagyu flat iron steak which he said was \"just ok.\" A little curious as to how neither dish was served with potatoes. I mean, that's the name of the restaurant, right? Meat and potatoes?  Anyway, desserts were just parfaits in various flavors, served in small jars. Perhaps our expectations were too high or perhaps the restaurant is overhyped. Either way, I'd suggest making a meal out of appetizers - the entrees disappoint.",

We have stopped post-CLO shows and had coffee on a couple of occasions as well. Always a good spot for coffee and dessert! The service was good, with the servers always attentive. The most challenging things about this location are its size and tight quarters. Tables are very close together and it can be difficult to not be sitting on top of other guests. The waiting area is also very limited. If you do not have a reservation, you will be waiting a while for a table due to lack of space inside, and there isn't much room to wait out in the lounge.

More crowded than NYC restaurants. We sat for 55minutes before our food came out. They apologized due to the private party of 20 in the back. HOWEVER, the tables around us who came in 20-30min after us got their food 15minutes before we did. The waitress did her best to apologize.  The manager gave us 50% off our food. The food turned out to be too salty, too greasy, or too sweet, and mediocre. I got hypoglycemic waiting for the food so I ate some of mine anyway.  We still left a sizable tip because the wait staff did try. We will try another place in the future.",

I am so sad I am only visiting the area and cannot come back to this restaurant to try everything else on the menu.   The stuffed french toast looked amazing and wish I had two stomachs so I could have gotten it too. I know that they infuse their own vodkas and have a Bloody Mary bar which is really cool.

The steak is huge, 3 people could probably share the steak.    My husband ordered the flat iron steak and I ordered the Cesar salad.  I had a bite of his steak and it had a lot of flavor.  He cleaned his plate so everything else must have been good.  He said that there were lots of different flavors on his plate.  The reason I ordered salad at a place called meat and potatoes is because I'm pretty basic, I'm not a fan of complicated ingredients.  My salad had a fried egg, pork rinds, and fried pork ears.  Everything in my salad was good except there was a sour fishy sauce that I could taste, it wasn't horrible but it was different.    The place is great if you like food that is cooked with non typical flavors.  It is quite pricey but it seems like all the portions were huge.",

One of my girls picked out Meat and Potatoes when I was visiting, and this was a great choice.  Six of us had a great table, round and good for conversation, in a corner of the room with a nice view of the restaurant; the bar looked like a nice place to sit for a casual meal.  The duck breast was outstanding and looked nice on the plate, others had the chicken and the meatloaf and a couple other things and everyone was very happy.  (One odd note that has now recurred in Pittsburgh; it seems like every time we ask a waiter 'we have a vegetarian dining tonight, any suggestions for how to work around the menu?', the first thing our waitress asked back is, 'so do you eat fish?'  This is the second time this happened!  I mean, it's no big deal, but still odd.  I'd understand eggs or cheese, people want to clarify between vegetarian and vegan and that's not clear, but a fish is not a vegetable!).",

You could probably serve three people with that huge steak.  Service was good as well.  My only nit (and hence 4 stars) is that the dinky, dull steak knives they provide are useless.  These are the little wooden handle, $10 for a case type that you got at the Goodwill store in college.  Even though the meat was pretty tender, it was very difficult to cut.  The server said they keep fighting with the manager to buy new, larger knives.  I've eaten at steak joints all over the world and gotta say, this is the only time I've had to complain about cutlery.    So if Mr Meat & Potatoes Manager reads these, don't be a cheapskate, please go buy some real steak knives so I can easily cut that wonderful piece of meat!",

She was good at making them tender but hers, I'm sorry to say, weren't nearly as sublime as these.  The lamb shank was delicious too, with a unique seasoning and a perfect preparation.  Beyond that?  The punch I ordered was a very good drink.  All in all, an excellent, 5-star experience.  Oh yeah, and then there was the excellent wine recommendation.  I never thought I'd utter the words, \"can I have some more of that delicious California Pinot?\"  Especially after having been in both Burgundy and Willamette within the last 6 months.  As I sat there on my way to Chicago from New York, I decided, based on the atmosphere and the food, that maybe Pittsburgh is the gateway to the Midwest; closer in style to Chicago than to New York.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Saturday with my mom, around 12:45 PM. We were greeted quickly and asked if we had a reservation (we did not). The host hemmed and hawed and then said we could sit at the bar or in a quieter off room since the restaurant was full for reservations. We chose the quieter room. The server did a great job of making sure we weren't forgotten back there, especially since the only other party who were back there with us left about 10 minutes after we arrived. But the room was weird, like a converted break room they added for events/large parties. It didn't match the decor of the main dinning area, and it never filled up. The restaurant closes from 2-5, so I'm not sure why we had to sit in the back room, as the main dining area never filled up either, but I digress. Unbeknownst to me, M&P was still serving brunch at that time we arrived, which was unfortunate, as we really wanted more of the lunch portion of brunch, which was a little lackluster on the menu. My mom ended up ordering the brisket and eggs, and I got the Pittsburg cheesesteak. Both entrees came out promptly, and were very flavorful and hot! The waiter was prompt and checked on us a couple of times, which I appreciated, since we weren't in anyone's line of sight being in the strange room. At the end of my meal, I inquired about the bathroom, which was another strange ordeal. You need to leave the restaurant completely and walk to the theater area to use the restroom. It's very odd and a bit convoluted, as I was told to leave the restaurant and it'll be there immediately on my left.   Bottom line: if I lived here, I'd try their dinner menu. I wouldn't be inspired enough to come back and try brunch, and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend them to my friends who may come to visit Pittsburgh. Also, these guys aren't on Open Table. Never even thought to make a reservation via Yelp, so I'd suggest to them to make it easier for patrons to be prepared.",

I really don't understand the fancy-kind of vibe but then take tables, cut them in half and that's all you get. There was (6) tables for 2, all guys were on the side near east the bar and our elbows were 12\" max from hitting each other it made 0 sense. More of the business side of things, more tables = more profit despite your customers feel like sardines . The huge mirrors on the wall where all of these tables for 2 are, every single one of them were filthy . I was going to take a picture but I didn't want to be that guy. I just figured a place with a great reputation would actually clean the place. Also for a \"fancy\" place, we ordered calamari ... I thought it was pretty damn tacky to charge $16 for calamari and then serve it to us in a plastic try that you would get fries in at a bowling alley.   Summary The place is hypocritical... fancy place to go eat downtown, we expect you to pay for the fancy but will only meet you halfway.  Food - great Expensive  Not really clean (mirrors actually pissed me off for some reason)  Not a lot of room  2 dinners, 1 app, I think 4 drinks was $156 with tip . Her dinner was a special   Again to go downtown to pay that plus parking I don't think was terrible, but I'm not here like we have to go back ASAP",

    "text": "In short, very disappointed with both the service and uninspired kitchen.  As a business, M&P lacks True character by trying to fulfill too much and does not hit any of the marks correctly.  If you are a person who shops via brand name itself, this will be the place for you.  If you are a person who says this chartreuse and maroon tie I'm wearing would go great with a black IPA, head elsewhere.  1. Pretentious. Having lived in Austin and Portland, you get a sense of style about a place.  This has the sense of going too over the top in many areas such as the decor and music choices.    The bartenders have \"prohibition era\" hats and some obligatory hipster beards while the music was a bouncy jazz song that played on repeat trying to mask the noise from the crowded place.   As others mentioned, the tables are extremely tiny geared for a lounge and go type of place.  The menu calls canned bear as \"Tin\" .  With all that room on the menu, should it not simply say \"Not on draught\" or \"Bottle\".  Why not \"Aluminum\"?  Personally, go breaking bad and just put the scientific symbol \"AL13\".  But as others mentioned, a PUB means beer on draught; put the bottles on another list - in fact, just put the drinks on another list.  Refer to Peche in Austin, TX for the right way on how to focus on a \"theme\" (in Peche's case, limited french food, Absinthe and Prohibition cocktails)  2. Basic Stewardship underwhelming in a cultural district. Sorry to say, but the staff did not seem to engage with customers more than a basic order taker.    The server did not have knowledge about the beers and could not articulate the flavors of the specials on the menu for us to care; you were left to do the addition.  e.g. Mussles + Curry + White Wine = \"Oh yeah, a light spicy flavor with a salty twinge\"  When asked about the wine and drink list it was a similar reaction.  3. Menu needs love The menu was fairly large and had multiple sections to work with.  There was nothing that called itself out as \"I'm why they call it M&P bitch\" other than the also obligatory (Amarillo Texas Styled) Big steak  Like many early gastropubs, they try focusing on the (fancy?) ingredients more than the mood they're trying to hit with the food.  Give it a condensed description and useful name.  \"Flaming Firey Wings of Damnation\" is a good example.  With a name like Meat and Potatoes, just lay it out there on one side in big letters of MEAT.  Show off the proteins in bold.  4. Food is uninspired.  Had the smoked wings (per other recommendations) and as a self-identified wingman, these were lightly smoked but could have come from Quaker down the block.  The sweetbread tacos were interesting as a different meat but it too lacked a palate definition.  I tried very hard to interrogate the server on other options.  Even to suggest a place with \"Meat\" in the name should try different styles of beef.  Refer to Victory 44 in Minneapolis, MN for the right way.  With a name like Meat and Potatoes, you expect hearty.  With a floral patterned menu and jazzy beat you get not gastropub but \"new American\"",

    "text": "Quite possibly the most disappointing and un-delicious restaurant experience I've had anywhere.   I make it out to Pittsburgh once a year to visit my family, and this year we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice meal out at Christmas. One of my family members suggested Meat & Potatoes because of its outstanding reputation, and because it had been advertised all over Pittsburgh Today Live.   We ordered the pate appetizer from the lunch menu, along with a round of cocktails, which were actually pretty tasty. But the pate was oddly and cloyingly sweet and came with only a few meager triangles of grilled bread. We asked for more since it wasn't nearly enough for the pate, and were informed we would be charged extra- something I've never seen happen in a restaurant, ever. Come on, it's bread.  They were out of the fried chicken and biscuits, but strangely still had enough fried chicken to offer the fried chicken sandwich, so I settled for that. I still have a hard time believing they could ruin something as simple as a sandwich, but this thing had absolutely no flavor at all. It was so bland I couldn't even taste the chicken! It was also drenched in a honey glaze, presumably to mask the tastelessness of the meat itself. The coleslaw was its only saving grace, and I was grateful to have something with some flavor to put on that sandwich. The Chick-Fil-A I had next day was leagues better, to be sure.  Everyone else seemed a little more satisfied- my brother enjoyed his burger and my grandma her mussels, though the side bread was absolutely saturated in melted butter. My sister-in-law had a steak salad, which didn't look like anything special.   I've eaten some great meals in Pittsburgh, and this place hardly lives up to the city's culinary rep.",

Started with a sampling of the black truffle fries, the 'Devils on Horseback' (best dish of the night, chorizo wrapped in a date wrapped in bacon), and a pile of wings that were spectacular.   I had the Wagyu filet for dinner - very good. My friend had that pork chop that was almost the size of my arm and it was delicious as well.  Ended the night with a creme brulee that was perfectly done (warm center).  The ambiance was great, only complaint would be a lacking wine list.",

This time it was a marvelous rye whiskey and laphroig concoction with a large dose of citrus. I think the citrus might have overpowered the smokiness in the whiskey bev, but either way it was still awesome.  We all shared some devils on horseback (must eat bacon wrapped figs, nom!), and some wagyu beef sashimi (double nom).  My main course was the duck with chimichurri (what a fun word, perhaps my first born son will be named chimichurri). It was very good, and did not have the typical fatty-gamey flavor of duck and had a more roast beef consistency.   My girlfriend ordered the lamb roast and, whew, that was a hit. She continues to perpetually make superior orders to mine.   M  and P is still one of the best restaurants in the 412.",

A healthy portion of collards and beans but the greens were way too sweet but were cooked perfectly with some \"tooth.\"  The beans were less than tender definitely undercooked. So the two sides were not very good. Would try again maybe mussels?  They looked interesting.",

Food came quickly and while we had long waits between interactions with the server - he was attentive when we had him.  We ordered one of the mussel choices - prosciutto, lemon, white wine and garlic.  Grilled bread.  To die for.  Three of us shared the large ribeye for two and good god it was amazing.  Perfectly cooked.  Excellent flavor.  Excellent quality.  Probably one of the best cuts of meat I've ever had.  Honestly the food was well worth the kind of lax service.  I have found the service to be attentive in the other restaurants in this group...so maybe it was a bad night?  Service was by no means bad.  It was just a little off.  It was a busy theater night and we made the show with time to spare.  I would definitely go back!",

Overall good food, but nothing outstanding. The cons: Waitress was fairly blase, bland flavors, buyer's remorse.   The mac 'n' cheese appetizer was likely the star of the show. The chicken livers were pretty good, but with the intensity of the ingredient, I would've liked smaller slivers (no biggie). My friend and I ordered the giant ribeye, with sides of Brussel sprouts and au gratin, with sauces of chimichurri and truffle butter. I do not think it is possible to cook such a piece of meat with traditional methods to anything above rare; we had to return it because it was essentially raw throughout the middle. However, it was a very thick cut of meat, and very tender - very good quality. Unfortunately, there was no crust or seasoning; the chimichurri and truffle butter were bland; the sides were just okay. A little salt would have gone a long way.   I did not think the quality justified the price, unfortunately. I was pretty pumped :\\",

It's intimate and cozy- perfect for dinner before a show, a nice date, or even just something a bit more special than normal. Our server was super friendly and helpful. He walked that very fine line of being there when we needed him, but not overcrowding us perfectly.  We ordered the Salty Pig flatbread as an appetizer- not disappointed! It was the perfect size for 2 people to split without filling up too much before dinner. We both got the Flat Iron steak meal. W-O-W! The thick cut of the steak was cooked perfectly. The butternut squash paired with potatoes and broccoli rabe complimented the meat and each other really well.  I would highly suggest making a reservation if you're going at a time that could even remotely be considered busy. Meat and Potatoes is pretty small, so I don't imagine they have the capacity for walk-ins during these times. Luckily, it's very easy to make a reservation using OpenTable!",

    "text": "They have an extensive menu including Build Your Own Meat & Potatoes for Two, but my friend and I decided to share a bunch of Snacks and Appetizers off the menu instead. We may have overdone it! We definitely ended up taking some leftovers home...  Let's start with the Fried Brussels with Parmesan and lemon aioli. These were excellent! Super crispy, toasty, and cheesy, with a light and refreshing dipping sauce. A fantastic choice.  Next we tried the Devils on Horseback, which are dates stuffed with chorizo and Manchego cheese, wrapped in bacon, and topped with a piquillo pepper sauce. These were probably our least favorite dish of the evening. They were ok, but nothing special.  We also got the Poutine, which is a generous helping of fries topped with gravy, cheese curds, and scallions. I've never met a poutine I haven't liked, and this was a wonderfully satisfying addition to the story of my life.  The Wild Mushroom Risotto here is a must! This is one of my local friend's favorites from previous visits, and I concur that it's quite excellent. Creamy and cheesy with a hint of aromatic truffle.  Last but not least, we also got the Cobb salad, which was split onto two plates for us to make it easier to eat. It features iceberg carpaccio (essentially a thinly sliced cross-section), bacon lardons, tomatoes, Maytag blue cheese, egg, and avocado ranch dressing. This was the \"fresh\" component to our meal, and was a lovely way to round out our super filling array of dishes.  Let's not forget the delicious cocktail I tried. My friend teased me because I didn't believe her that a Corpse Reviver #2 is an actual classic cocktail, then she proved me wrong with Google :) I couldn't resist the name and the description, so I ordered this classic cocktail of Tanqueray gin, Cointreau, Cocchi Americano, lemon, and Copper & Kings Absinthe. It was tastier than the name sounds, that's for sure!  All in all I really enjoyed dinner at Meat & Potatoes. I can see why it's a popular spot, and I would happily visit again on a future trip to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "WOW. That's the first thing I said when they brought out my food. Boyfriend and I shared the meat for two (45 oz. steak) that came with a bone marrow gratin. We also ordered a side of bearnaise sauce and fried brussel sprouts.   First things first, the portions were MASSIVE. Our meal could easily serve 4 people. Food came out fast even though they quoted us a much longer wait time for the steak.    Our steak was juicy and well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The bone marrow was absolutely decadent. Wish I had some bread to soak up the bone marrow juices! It was my first time trying bearnaise sauce and I wasn't super impressed. The brussel sprouts on the other hand, were simply amazing. Super flavorful and definitely enough to share for 2 people. It came was a nice lemon aioli on the side, which helped give the dish some creaminess and acidity.   We ended our meal with carrot cake and I will happily say it was one of the prettiest and tastiest carrot cake I have ever had. It was elegantly plated and easy to eat. This is a must if you love carrot cake!  Overall this meal was definitely a cheat meal and something I imagine people would choose as their final meal. Highly recommend people try this place out at least once!",

    "text": "Terrible brunch experience. Very disappointing. I've been wanting to check out meat and potatoes for years, but wanted to wait until I was eating meat again (obviously) today, we ran 6 miles and I would have eaten grass off of the side of the road, sadly enough It was still disappointing.   1- automatically fell in love with decor. Very dark and moody, which is different for brunch. The host, not so nice. We got there at a great time and were able to snag two seats at the bar with no wait. However, it took 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge we were sitting there (did we not look STARVING) 2- Bloody Mary bar, I get I. Cool concept.. and he Bloody Mary was the best part of my brunch. Of course I added 500 toppings. 3- Food (trying my best to not sound completely negative) WHEN the food came out.. mediocre at best. Salmon flatbread, very good taste but the crust was not nearly done. Flat breads should be crispy, I shouldn't be eating a flat bread and wondering if dough is cooked all the way through, am I right? SIDE of potatoes, yummy taste.. no where CLOSE to being cooked completely. And last but not least, the worst Benedict I have ever had. My biscuit beneath was hard, almost couldn't cut through. Egg, 100% over cooked. And hardly any of the  hollandaise sauce. It was completely dry, and not enjoyable to eat what so ever. In addition my \"crab cake\" was breaded, and deep fried.. YUCK... tasted like a frozen $1 patty 3- Drinks, again.. \"hello over here\" the service was terrible. And we were sitting at the bar. The drinks we had were good. The only complaint I has was I am almost certain that we got over charged for one drink. At this point it wasn't even worth bringing up because I was SO ready to get out of there.  3- Service, totally poor. Including the visual negativity from everyone in the restaurant. The DJ even had a sour face.. It was like.. \"come on it's Sunday morning!?\"  4- kicker. We ended up making friends with two out of towners sitting next to us. When we got our checks at the same time, ours was over $100 and I overheard them say \"how the hell is our check only $37?!\" (They had equally as much as us\"..... whoever rang them out gave them 1/2 off of every single thing they ordered (good, drinks). HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? so here I am, so cranky over lousy expensive food, and these dudes got 1/2 off?!  Believe me when I tell you it would take major convincing for me to come back here, or recommend this place to anyone. Thumbs down!",

So flavorful and creamy but with delicious texture from the crumbs. bits of pork mixed in but doesn't overpower the flavors of the cheeses. my husband and I also shared the 34 ounce ribeye. it was cooked a perfect medium rare and did not disappoint. our server recommended the mushrooms which weren't my favorite but I was too full to even care. The steak was incredible and well worth the $75. It could easily have been shared among a family of 4. would highly recommend and will be back one day.",

I think that due to its eclectic vibe, meaty offerings (ha! sorry), and well rounded menu, Meat and Potatoes is a fine choice for any of those seeking Pittsburgh's more impressive experiences.  I loved the atmosphere inside, which, although crowded, still felt immersive and personable. Great choice for a date. The service was also friendly and I never felt rushed during our meal. Everything was delicious! We got Thai mussels, poutine, and the tomahawk steak - - all of which were excellent. The latter was utterly massive and, despite its size, delivered both steak and sizzle (I'M SORRY! I will axe the puns. Ha. Ugh.) We remarked several times over just how this thing must've been prepared (like, with half the bone stretching out of the grill?) and the tomahawk was definitely a lasting conversation piece for a memorable meal.   I look forward to returning and trying more of the menu. Overall we were all very pleased!",

When my wife started to eat her favorite dish she realized that there was no egg on top, which is an essential part of the dish, nor was there an egg the other Bi Bim Bap plate ordered at our table.  Once getting the attention of the waite staff he was shocked and apologetic about the egg being forgotten. There was a misunderstanding about both dishes not having the egg, so only one was brought out, after a little more wait the second egg came.  They didn't want their dishes to get cold nor eat an incomplete meal, so while they waited they ate some of the dish without one of the highlights. The thing that got me was the bill was full price. Now I wasn't expecting a free meal, but they could have offered us a comped drink or dessert, but nothing was offered for the inconvenience of 2 incorrect meals.  Just not what we expected from this establishment.",

It's a gastropub, which can be bad is done poorly, but this is a pretty good example of how it can be done well.  They normally have a burger special, which is usually what I end up ordering.  They had one that was basically a burger and a pulled pork sandwhich combined together with an onion ring on top... Wow.  The craft beer list is long and reasonably priced.  Great location and good food.  Enjoy!",

Because of her, he had to move his chair to the other side but she'd never apologized until we asked to do.  Their service was also very slow.  Second, unimpressive foods.  We had stakes and Bo Ssam there. Stakes were not bad. However, Bo Ssam was awful.  Bo Ssam is a Korean traditional dish. Since I am a native Korean, I'm really well aware of how the dish should be. It is NOT the Bo Ssam at all. It is not even close to the original dish and there is nothing close to the original dish. So disappointed.  Actually, I tried to find anything positive about this restaurant and the only positive thing is the location. That's all.   Will never go this restaurant again!!",

    "text": "First, the negative. My entree arrived an hour and ten minutes after we sat. Our server was nice enough, but was too busy and distracted to get our full order until the appetizer was on the table and half gone. We ordered the appetizer as soon as he greeted us, and it came quickly, so that was quite a long wait for the main course.  That was my only complaint, and if the service had been on point, this would be a five star review. A few quibbles follow but didn't change my enjoyment of the experience.  For an appetizer we split fried brussels spouts. Delicious. (The sauce was pretty bland, but not needed.) My cocktail was also damn tasty. I ordered and aviation, but John recommended something different - whatever it was I liked it. Our entree was the meat and potatoes for two. What that looked like was about a pound of steak fries, cooked in fat or tallow. On top was a cowboy ribeye about the size of a cow, cooked right to temerature, covered with a slew of mushrooms sauteed in garlic and more fat, and a nice sized marrow bone split in half and roasted with cheese. This was served with ketchup and the house steak sauce which was delicious, even though I like meat best unadorned. All of the above was executed amazingly.   My bf also ordered a side of mashed potatoes. These were tasteless. Also, the table was too small to hold both the huge platter of meat and potatoes and plates, so we ate from the serving tray. This made it awkward to eat in a civilized fashion, but the food was so amazing I would have eaten with my hands if I needed to.  Executive summary: delicious food, but served too slowly.",

    "text": "If you like \"meat and potatoes\", this might not be the place for you.  The cocktail selection was outstanding, as was the beer selection.  The food is out there (I went in with this expectation so was not caught off guard).  One of our appetizers was bone marrow---like they bring out a calf leg that has been cut in half and you eat the marrow right out of the bone.  It isn't an appetizer for the faint of heart, but I liked it.  For my main course I had a fantastic leg of lamb, perfectly cooked, with a side of mashed potatoes and something called sweet bread.  I figured it was just that, sweet. bread.  That isn't what sweet bread is.  It's ground up thymus, pancreas, testicles, tongue, etc. of a lamb.  The texture was a huge turn off, but the taste was so-so.  I would not order the sweet bread again.  All in all, the environment was great, a little more upscale with a waitstaff that can play the part.  I was in a suit and did not feel out of place.  My one issue, and I can't say it was the food for certain, but both my girlfriend and I were incredibly sick later that night.  I had a fever, was sweating, and just generally felt terrible---my girlfriend was the opposite, freezing cold, but just as sick.  Like I said, might have had nothing to do with the food; might have been that I had never eaten anything of that nature before and my system didn't know what to think.  Anyway, I will return, just not for the sweetbread.  Cheers, Rob",

But it happened when I had a couple people visit from out of town and Butcher and the Rye was sold out (not that that name is any more appetizing, ha!). So yeah. They wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant and the three $$$ seemed to fit the bill.   I ordered fried brussels and mushroom flatbread - mission accomplished! While it was a little sad to make a tiny dent in the bill while actually paying for my carnivore visitors ordering the likes of Wagyu Flat Iron, I was happy to see them satisfied with their meals. It helped that the service was impeccable and the ambience was not as stuffy as some other places that take themselves even more seriously.   While I won't be returning anytime soon, you should check the place out. I imagine that if you and/or your friends like the name (in a non-metaphorical sense) and enjoy good service, it's a pretty good place to be on a weeknight (can't speak for the weekend scene).",

We're not petite people, but this was more than we could handle. Still, the bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly. The marrow was kinda weird. Guess we just weren't that into it. The two classic cocktails I ordered (Negroni and Manhattan) were well balanced. My one complaint would be the service. The girls at the reception seemed lost and flustered, and one even commented that the software they were using was \"dumb\" (because she didn't know how to use it?). The tables are tiny, and they really pack you in there. It's a small place, so I guess space is at a premium. The waitress seemed almost overwhelmed, like she needed to get to her next task in a hurry, and we were keeping her from someone else more important.   Some customer-service focused training on the waitstaff would dramatically improve the overall experience. Like everyone else says, the food is fantastic, but the service is a bit spotty.",

We decided to go since we drove 30mins there and they had good reviews online. We got to the bar and it too was full. Servers zipped past us without asking if we wanted something. It was a small area packed with many tables. One table was even empty without a reservation sign. We started to just sit our asses down and order. After 5 mins or so and I'm sure in the servers way a portly manager arrived and rudely ask we move down. We stated we wanted to order and were in the right spot as it was the server area. However we never did get any service. The obese manager continued to argue with us that we needed to move down but didn't say to where to order.

As a appetizer we had the Kobe Corn Dog (which was very mediocre {didn't have the proper crisp, flavor was off}) and the Poutine (gravy was good wish there was more cheese curd).  I was going to order the Bone Marrow but the couple next to us said \"you have to try the Mac-N-Cheese it's amazing\" so we did....it was really good. There is Chorizo and Pulled Pork in it so it is very hardy....(we were both going to order entrees but after this we shared one).  We finished with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast. The pastrami duck was cooked a medium rear and was delicious with the chimichurri.  The pierogies it came with were good but nothing special.  Our server was fine....with us! He was seemingly short with the couple next to us who (the female was a vegetarian) seemingly asked questions about every dish. You got the vibe that maybe he's been spoken to about this by his managers....i.e. quipping back.  Highlight of the night might have been the two Spanish guys (in \"wife-beaters\") who sat themselves at a table to \"just get some drinks.\" After two Corona's they left but clearly the restaurant did not have the proper procedures in place to deal with this....  (It shows I have 4 check in's here.....I've only been here once. Verizon network was having issues that night into the morning.)",

I tried everything I could eat on the menu, and I was in love.  Simply it was divine.  They have also started doing lunch on Fridays during Lent, unfortunately it's over.  I hope they bring it back and soon!  My suggestion is to come here with friends, and try a bit of everything, so you get a feel of what do you do like.  I particularly enjoy their fish sandwiches (during lunch), fried pickles, and moules and frites.  They make some killer cocktails, and the servers and owner are extremely friendly.  I even spotted the entire Steelers O-line here one evening, it's definitely a hot spot!",

    "text": "Wow!  If you are a committed carnivore, this is the place for you.  We had a party of five on a Saturday night at 9:00 pm.  Place was full.  Ordered for appetizers the kobe corn dog, devil on horseback, fried pickles and fried brussel sprouts (when you have to have vegetables, fry it out. :-)). The fried brussel spouts were really good, and would definitely reorder every time I'm here.  Fried pickles were also tasty, but would have probably preferred a thinner cut. Kobe corn dog was also delicious, but if you are planning to order a large entree (see below) this will fill you up too much.  The Devil on Horseback which is a date stuffed with manchego cheese and wrapped in bacon was also excellent, but the fried brussel sprouts were my favorite   Leaves were nice and crunchy, nicely salted,  awesome.  Now, for the entree, we ordered two  steak for two entrees for the five of us.  That's 34 oz of a tomahawk ribeye, with bone marrow gratin and steak fries.  This place knows how to cook steak, and that is an understatement.  Our steak was a perfect medium rare with a nice outside char.  It was topped with a mushroom sauce with huge pieces of mushrooms. The meat was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife.  The bone marrow gratin was so rich, but the crunchy breadcrumb topping was a beautiful offset.   And the amazing thing to top it all off, was that dinner was less than $40 per person with wine and drinks.  I come from NY, and that is just not possible in the Big Apple.  You go to a great steakhouse in NY,and plan to spend three times that amount for five people.   We like to visit Pittsburgh because it's a great city with my favorite football team.  Meat & Potatoes is just another reason to take that special trip to the Steel City.  This is an awesome place!",

I'm not a fan of their wine list, but I am very picky.  Also, I do not look at this place as a wine hotspot. The food was excellently prepared.  Everything was properly seasoned, and the burger was exactly med-rare!  Finally, someone who knows how to cook to temp!  The mussels were so good we took the leftover broth home. The only thing I did not like is the way the daily specials were presented.  They are so intricate and expansive that they need to be presented in writing (not on a chalkboard on the wall, because my date couldn't see them).  Instead the server verbalized all of them and after the first 2 minutes of that spiel I gave up on following along.  Please make it more accessible. All in all, I love it, and will be back!!!",

Based on the name, it didn't sound like the kind of place I could show up in a suit, but I wasn't about to go to the hotel and change clothes. To my surprise, this place was as trendy and chic as could be, and full of after work professionals.  I sat at the bar and started with an order of wings. Turned out to be best wings I've had in quite a while. I then ordered the pork chop which comes with apple cole slaw, pastrami and baked beans. The pork chop is huge! But the meal is delicious. Everything was awesome and the only reason i didn't finish the pork chop was because it was so big.    The rum selection at this place was also awesome, which in my eyes completed what was an excellent experience. Highly recommended!",

From a food perspective, we've had mixed experiences. On a brunch visit with a large group, most were satisfied, but my grandpa's fried chicken was burned (the exterior even looked overly browned) and my huevos rancheros weren't very flavorful. We've been here many times for dinner and have had a large chunk of the menu, and again had some hits and misses: fried pickles, duck pate, short rib flatbread, mac 'n cheese, and all chocolate desserts (that dirt pudding!) were great, while the fried chicken livers (cut way too large and the breading fell off) and duck breast (not very flavorful, overcooked) just didn't do it for us.

We actually had our first date there and fell in love. This time, which was on 6/17/17, the quality was surprisingly declined. The hostess wore canvas shoes with a very ratty dress. The service was a little slow, and the rate for the food to come to the table was VERY slow. The prices have almost increased by 20%, and the quantity decreased. The food was either over seasoned with vinegar or over seasoned with salt. When we left, we went to a local burger joint just to be full. I use to love this place. Being I have been so busy and live almost an hour away. I couldn't come by as often. It's been a little over a year, and wow did it change. It's ashame. It use to be a great place to dine. Now, not so much. I'm not sure if they changed chefs or owners. But at this rate, I will be VERY surprised if they see 3 more years. Bad news travel fast. I'm very disappointed that this place changed ... for the worse.",

    "text": "This place is a carnivore's heaven on Earth.   Last month my boyfriend and I took a mini road trip from New York to Pittsburgh to visit my sister and brother in law. I did some research about the places I wanted to visit while I was there. This was at the top of my list.  We called around 9pm to see if there were any tables open. We were told the wait was only 10 minutes and we were seated right away when we arrived! I don't believe this is something that happens frequently; we were very lucky.   We were seated right near the kitchen. Normally, I wouldn't be too fond of this, because of the foot traffic with servers and busboys etc, but with these huge, comfy, throne-like chairs, nothing was going to get me down.  We started with drinks, my boyfriend ordered the First Word and I ordered the Desperado. Both were really unique and enjoyable, with a swift kick. I suggest the Desperado only to people who really enjoy tequila, like me. Otherwise, I think it may be too much for people to handle.  Instead of ordering full meals, we decided to order a bunch of appetizers and eat tapas style. It was the best decision we've made, to date.  We had fried pickles (well, everyone else had fried pickles since I don't enjoy them, but they loved them.) We also had the fried Brussels. Oh my god, so good. And the dipping sauce was great, too! The tartare was different than any I've ever had before, probably because the meat was chunky rather than super ground down, but I really enjoyed it. The egg that accompanied it made the dish. The risotto was good, but probably the least successful of all the dishes. Texture wasn't that of an amazing risotto, but it tasted good. Lastly, the bone marrow. Oh my god . 3 huge half bones filled with creamy meaty goodness. I have dreamed about it quite often since my encounter with it. It was incredible. Also, it was only $14. Are you kidding? I'm from New York where this can be upwards of $30 and people would still pay. I was in shock.  For dessert we had some sort of cheesecake and bread pudding. They were good, also!   Prices are on point, the food was incredible, drinks were good, and the atmosphere was great. This is a destination I plan on visiting every time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I was bound to love Meat & Potatoes, due mostly to my unstoppable love of both meat and potatoes. Beyond that, the spot is a great place for drinks, brunch, or dinner.   Every time I visit, I am floored by how fairly the place is priced. Sure, you can go with a $50 steak, but there are also reasonably priced delicious burgers, tacos, or a breakfast sandwich at brunch. There's an adventurous element to the menu (I ate fried chicken livers last meal there!) dressed down as comfortable pub fare. One of the most popular menu items is the bone marrow.   The decor is hip and fun, but when I go I don't feel like I need to starve myself the next few days to make up for breaking the bank. The place is always packed, don't plan on going there before a show if you don't have a reservation. Actually, just don't plan on going unless you have a reservation--I went on a Monday at 8:30pm and it was still crowded.   So why not 5/5 stars? Every time I've visited Meat & Potatoes, I've had some issue at the hostess station. They consistently seat you at least 15 minutes late for reservations, and they tried to seat me outside last November (which would've been perfect had I been trying to catch pneumonia). I wouldn't downgrade if this was a single occurrence, but every time I go, there is some sort of confusion upfront. Midway through my meal, I almost always forget because the food is so delicious.",

    "text": "I went here with a group of friends to socialize and catch up as one of them was visiting. Parking is easy enough as there's parking garages close by, but the location between a Cabaret theater and a music hall means it can get busy before or after shows. Inside is dim with atmosphere and small, but it has a nice feel to it, plus the seats are very comfortable.  Appetizers of flatbread pizza, fried pickles, and mussels were a great way to start. The pizza was very flavorful and I really liked it. The fried pickles were done in a way that the breading stuck with the pickles and didn't come apart when eaten. It wasn't that sour either, but just the right amount. The mussels by themselves could have served a meal. There were quite a bit as an appetizer and split nicely between the five of us. The soup base was an interesting mix of bacon and salmon roe, which worked extremely well with the mussels and bread on top.  For entrees, I ordered the salmon along with another friend while other people ordered a burger, lamb shank, and pork chops with apple coleslaw. The salmon they had was a fusion of sorts where they mixed the idea of Korean bibimbap with an egg on salmon cooked medium. The salmon was cooked nicely, but combined the rest, it was a bit of a miss. The kimchi under the fish and the sauce used for bibimbap completely overpowered the whole dish. The black rice they used is supposed to be soft and sticky when cooked traditionally, but they seemed to have pan fried it to give it a crunchy texture. It could have worked, but tasted more like uncooked rice. The cucumber was slightly sweet and went along with the dish, but the kimchi/sauce still overpowered everything.  Trying some of my friend's dishes, the lamb shank was soft and smooth, which I enjoyed. The pork was cooked well and my friend really enjoyed it. The serving size for both of these were large and filling. The salmon was a good size and filling as well. I didn't get a chance to try the hamburger, but my friend enjoyed it.  For dessert, I decided to try the tiramisu they had. The presentation in a jar wasn't what I was expecting as tiramisu is usually presented as a small block on a dish. Once I dug in, I realized why it was in a jar:  The texture of dessert was more like pudding than bread-like, most likely due to the alcoholic content in it. Other than that, it was normal tiramisu in a more pudding form. It was okay, nothing impressive, but nothing bad either.  Overall, with good service and good dishes for the most part, I would recommend people to try this place.",

If you don't have a reservation, the wait can be ridiculous, but it is worth it.  you can also walk up to the bar and they serve the full menu there.  I like their decor and location.  They also have outside seating.  I feel like it's a speakeasy type place because they serve the types of drinks served at speakesies.  My husband, who is a whiskey drinker, likes their manhattan drink  He says they make it differently here.  I'm not a whiskey person, so I won't be the best judge in that matter.  Like in everyone's reviews, the bone marrow appetizer is a must.  It may sound steep to pay $18 for it, but they actually give you a lot of bone marrow.  I've been to places where they serve one bone marrow, but this appetizer can be shared with 4 adults.  I say adults bc we have big appetites. LOL.  You can eat it as an entree bc it is filling, but probably won't be good for you healthwise.  The flavor is amazing with the toast and condiments that come with it, and you can ask for more toast if you want.    Tonight, my husband and I had dinner here before a show at heinz hall.  My husband had the duck dish and I had the pork belly tacos.  The portion here is huge, so I really feel like the price is on point.  My husband really wanted a peanut butter oreo dirt dessert, but I had to be a downer bc I wanted to go to another bar for martinis.  they have yummy desserts here.  I think they rotate but I remember the cheesecake in a jar being delicious.  The brunch is also good.  I like the short rib hash and huevos rancheros.  I've had better chicken and waffles in other cities, but this is the only place I know so far in pittsburgh that has chicken and waffles.  What I didn't like was the waffles were tough like it was dry and needed more syrup than what was given.  We had our engagement brunch here a year or so ago.  We were a group of 14, and when I originally made the reservation, they could only give us 2 separate tables.  I ended up saying yes to it bc I really wanted my out of town fam and friends to try this place.  They were so accommodating and ended up giving us the private room in the back.  eventhough it was hidden past the kitchen, that did not bother us at all.  I like how they arranged the tables into a big square, so it was easy to talk to everyone.  At that time, I forgot what everyone got, but everyone was impressed with the quality of food and the decor.  I feel like that says a lot bc our fam and friends came from foodie cities like chicago, nyc, seattle, cali.  In general, I highly recommend this place.  Good place to take an out of towner.",

No joke. After waiting almost an hour and half for it to come out, It was 90% gristle and fat. Yes I know Ribeyes are more fatty. Ribeyes are my preferred cut of meat. This was not up to snuff. Everything was very gimmicky and trendy just to be trendy. This restaurant is constantly hyped up by everything I read online and by everyone, but after this third visit I just cannot see the appeal.",

This place is definitely worth checking out if visiting Pittsburgh and want some delicious food.  Make reservations and you'll be glad you didn't have to wait in line.  The interior is pretty I like how there's a mirror along the walls so the people facing the wall are able to people watch behind them (I like the people watching.  Creepy, I know).  Fighting a hangover, I asked for a coffee and liked it.  We asked for suggestions from our server who was really great in explaining the menu favorites to us.  Even the server for the table next to us gave us her choices too.  Everyone there is very friendly.  My friend had the short rib hash which looked amazing. Okay, I can speak for it since I stole a bite from her place.  It was damn good.  I chose the French toast and boy was I glad I did.  It was probably the best French toast I had ever had.  Those bananas!  Like bananas foster and what's that sauce? I'm not good at reviewing food other than telling you it was mad delicious.    Wish we had another night in the city to check this place out for dinner.  Seems to be a popular place with the locals and with good reason  I would definitely go back here if ever in Pittsburgh again.",

Went on a Tuesday night and despite the restaurant being packed due to a play, the hostess was extremely friendly and helpful, finding two seats at the bar for my friend and I.  The bartender was an absolute great guy and a True mixologist, once again taking the time to review the menu and drink options despite being swamped. We ordered bone marrow, the pork chop, and duck, all of which were extremely generous in portion and incredible on flavor, the service is top notch, the food is absolutely amazing, and the price is an absolute value all things considered.  Will def be going back and tell all my friends about it when they visit the burgh, kudos to everybody there, the only thing that I can see as a possible negative is the booth like seating around the restaurant, that would be annoying to be that close to other people, so I would def choose the bar if I had an option.",

Faves include the Croque-Madame, chicken and waffles, poutine ...

I have this theory about resturants that the later in the evening the worse off the service, the cooks/ wait staff are more tired I'm more tired...that's my  way of rationalizing poor service.   I ordered fried chicken livers and the mac and cheese I nibbled on these bits while sipping on a beer at the bar.    I then ordered the three little pigs to go.  The bar tender took my food away and boxed it up, then another waiter came with a bag that had my to go sandwhich in it.    I asked, \"Is all my food in here\"? He said \"yes\".  So I paid and left .   Well well well when I got home  only the sandwhich was in the box.  I always do the bag check when dining at say Wendys ...but I didn't think I would have to do a bag check at Meat and Potatoes. What a let down I wanted to finish my mac and cheese.  The buddy waiter/bartender system they have at the bar is confusing and I must say I don't like it.   The Mac and Cheese was so yummy too with smokey pulled pork through out. Gosh I wish I had checked that darn bag for the rest of my food lol.",

    "text": "A-OK. Which is unfortunate because we still gave Meat & Potatoes a try after hearing from a Pittsburgh local that has visited multiple times that the atmosphere is a real let-down and the food is good. However, the atmosphere created can ruin a meal, no matter how delicious the food.  Reading other reviews, I see that other people also commented on the incredibly poor customer service of the hostesses. Hosts and hostesses set-up the atmosphere of a restaurant. If the people \"welcoming\"you to the restaurant show that they are disinterested through their body language of slouching against the counter, not welcoming you first when you enter because they are paying attention to their phones, not asking how they can help you, giving attitude by sighing when you do not have a reservation, and not guiding you to the area where you can wait, it can ruin an entire experience. Which unfortunately because of two young hostesses it did. It was like being greeted by two angsty teenagers.  Our expected wait for the patio was 10 minutes (I am not sure what the wait was for inside because the hostesses did not tell us) e received a text from an automated system to be seated sooner. Coming back there was another hostess, who I talked to later in the evening about our experience with the younger hostesses. This other hostess has worked at Meat & Potatoes longer and was very kind and cheerful and took my comment politely and apologized for our experience. We were seated by the 'less' disinterested or maybe trying a little harder at her job, younger hostess who was at least standing upright when we walked in to the patio.  We were seated outside on the patio, which was lovely even for a hot day and the interior of the restaurant was very dark, loud, and you could smell all the food being served which was not necessarily pleasant. However, every so often smells which included everything from garbage and human smells if you know what I mean, from the alley which the patio was situated in (blocked off by a short fence) was a worse smell. In addition to sitting outside at the patio, there is only a small fence barrier to the alley and street, a group of people passed by and started berating customers that we were eating the 'cockroaches' they saw in the alley.  Our waitress, Crystal, was incredible. Her pleasant nature, positive conversation, knowledge about the menu definitely made the night for us. She came back often to refill our water for us, check in how we were doing, and apologized profusely for forgetting some lemons we asked for the water which was really not necessary, definitely appreciated.  We ordered fried pickles and Poutine from the Snacks menu, the 45oz ribeye and Sgt. Pepper's Old Fashioned to drink. Crystal and the server who brought out our snacks suggested we eat the Poutine quickly while it was hot which would allow the fried pickles to cool down, that information is always appreciated! The ribeye from 'build your own meat & potatoes for two' for $75 is a great deal as it definitely could serve at least four people. It was beautifully displayed on bone with the bone marrow gratin resting across and we ordered it with black truffle butter an extra $4 served in a small glass jar which was filled with black truffle and herbs. The food was excellent. I loved the thin cut fries of the Poutine and the scallion added a acidic contrast to the curds and gravy, but I would have preferred more gravy on them. The fried pickles order was small, but had a perfect breading that did not get soggy. The ribeye was perfectly cooked rare and the bone marrow gratin was oozing with deliciousness.  I would say that all three of us in my party enjoyed the meal, unfortunately the earlier experience of the hostesses actually caused one of my party members to leave before the ribeye, which ruined an otherwise lovely day in Pittsburgh. The food was fairly priced for the quality you are receiving. Our waitress Crystal made the night easy, the horrid detachment of the hostesses, smells and openness public jeering added to cutting our appetite short and our early leave. If we ever come back to Meat & Potatoes, we will not come sit at the restaurant.  I hope they do take-out.",

    "text": "I went to dinner at Meat and Potatoes expecting great things given all the reviews.  I was very disappointed.  The fried pickles were average at best.  The sauce container was so small, the pickles didn't fit inside to dip.  The fall salad wasn't bad if you ignore the abundance of radicchio lettuce and too much dressing and soggy pears. To cap off the night my flat iron steak came after waiting 1 hour.  The mushrooms and onions were a nice addition.  The steak was cooked perfectly at medium-rare but was definitely lacking flavor.  The french fries which the hostess raved about were small pieces of potatoes (nothing special - D+).    To charge $28 for a flat iron steak and a potato side dish is on the high side. It definitely needed a green vegetable.  I can get a nice strip steak for $30+ at McCormick and Schmick or Grand Concourse or even a basic ribeye for $28 at the Cheesecake factory.  For $40+ Morton's, Ruth Chris or Capital Grille is more appealing.  They offer a 28 ounce ribeye for 2 for $58.  Why not offer a smaller version for 1.    They need bread for the meals and ice cubes for the warm water.  Glasses for iced tea are too small.  I didn't bother asking about desert, I just wanted to get out of there!  The music had a loud repetitive beat.    I do have to say the burgers looked really good.  For some reason they don't open for lunch on Monday and Tuesdays.",

    "text": "We were very excited to try this restaurant and went there on Saturday night for my husband's birthday. After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.  Well as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance.   The most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.  So many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor.   Then our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook.   Neither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening.",

    "text": "My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill.   The two of us were seated along the wall where the \" tables\" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me.   Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better.  Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had.   We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong.  Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen.  Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal.   I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at $7 and $10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink.",

We got a flatbread starter (with jam and goat cheese) and a lamb entree, a beef pot roast, and the salmon with black rice. All were tender and flavorful and the service was extremely attentive. The decor is fantastic - high ceilings, cool lighting and details, a lovely bar in the center of the room, and two different outdoor seating areas. We sat inside (I loved the dining chairs - sort of like a comfy sofa for one) and left stuffed and happy.",

For apps, we had the tartar and the bone marrow. I my was my first time having bone marrow and tartar so I did not have anything to compare it to. I did enjoy both dishes and thought they were very flavorful. For main entrees, we ordered the duck and one of their specials. I thought the duck was a bit chewy for my taste, I've definitely had better and would probably would not order it again. The other dish (forget the name) was great and would definitely order again. For dessert, we had the French toast dish. Definitely delicious but felt more like a breakfast option than a dinner dessert option. Their cocktails and service are also great. The portions are definitely large. We left dinner very full. Would come again for a night out/cocktails at their bar.",

We expected the ribeye would take a bit more time to cook which was fine and we enjoyed our drinks and the mussels while waiting, and we were pleasantly surprised that once we finished the mussels it was ready, so that was perfect. When it did come out I was even more surprised because they had done something that I had never seen before. They stuck a candle in our steak!It wasn't by request either, my boyfriend just asked if they could do something special so that was really nice and I appreciate the creativity. The neighboring tables were also impressed and one person even asked to take a pic of it The food itself was amazing, the steak melted in your mouth and was cooked to perfection. I couldn't have been happier with the overall experience, oh and the drinks were great too!",

I got the pub burger and she gave me an extra napkin without me even asking. Super considerate and great service.  Fried Brussels: DELICIOUS, smoky, balanced,  cheesy, clean and sharp. Best Brussels I have ever had. Fried golden brown and covered in Parmesan, perfectly cooked and not mushy.   Poutine: Not anything out of this world but tasted good. Compared to the Brussels the poutine is mediocre but who can turn down fries, gravy and cheese curds? Fries vaguely remind me of five guys which is a plus because five guys makes pretty damn good fries.   Pub Burger: Incredible and suuuuper good, it's a burger with melt in your mouth pastrami pork belly, an egg and sauce. Really really good and absolutely huge, this is the best burger I have had in awhile  Wagu Flat Iron: Melt in your mouth, like a fillet mignon but with really great flavor. Cooked perfectly  Steak for Two: Huuuuuuuge. Really good too! If you like steak ribeye and are feeling hungry grab a buddy and get this. It comes out on this huge wooden cutting board with all of your sauces and sides. Sauces and sides are extra but you will definitely have leftovers, we had our steak with confit potatoes and roasted cauliflower and it was fantastic.   Overall: This restaurant is great!!! I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh. It's casual atmosphere has 80's music in the background and is very inviting. Our plates were so huge we didn't even get to dessert! Moderate price points and an excellent meal for all to be had.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to get to Meat & Potatoes since it opened a few years back. My interest was piqued recently when I read a Thrillist article that said they had the second best burger in Pittsburgh.   We arrived at 5:30PM on a Friday. I had made reservations earlier in the week. There were still a few tables open, but it was pretty busy. The seating was a little tight, but not bad.   We started off with the pigs ears and poutine appetizers. We devoured the poutine but left the pigs ears relatively untouched...not the taste for us. They were drenched in a tangy, asian-style sauce that you'll either love or hate. The poutine was amazing, the fries were great and hot, but it was very filling!  My husband and I both got the burgers. We both agreed that they were some of the best that we've had, especially considering the price point, only $11. The meat was great, they were cooked to order. Would absolutely order again.   We finished the meal with the chocolate pot dessert, which came highly recommended. It was smooth and delicious. Though, for my fellow chocoholics, I would be remiss if I didn't say it wasn't THAT chocolately and I still craved a little chocolate after I was done.   The service was impeccable. The waiter was attentive, informative, and patient. Some of the best service we've had in Pittsburgh to date. We will definitely be back to Meat & Potatoes.",

Meat & Potatoes didn't look like much was going on from the outside (it was raining) but as soon as we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. Reading about the bloody mary bar on Yelp is what attracted me to this place but the nice atmosphere and DJ really made it fun.   Our waitress was so pleasant and happily gave us recommendations for their house-infused vodkas and brunch entrees. My boyfriend and I both ordered the black pepper and garlic vodka for our bloody mary's and really enjoyed making our own versions at the bar. I honestly can't say what the vodka tasted like because I put so many other things in mine but I can say their bloody mary mix is amazing.  I had the brisket hash and it came with two eggs. It was so good but it was my birthday so I was more focused on my drink. My man got the fried chicken and he loved it so much that he ate every bite.  I'd love to come back and try dinner here, too. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, Meat & Potatoes will definitely be first on my list.",

The burger was large, well seasoned, juicy (not soggy), and flavorful. Came with a side of fries which were crispy with just the right amount of salt. The wait for the food wasn't bad considering how many people were at the restaurant. It took maybe around 20 min from the time we ordered our food to the time we received it. We were also served appetizers in that time frame which made the wait more bearable.",

They need to take a few tables out of there so the customers are comfortable eating their dinner! I guess we just came in a bad night. It took 15 mins to get our bar drinks (I don't blame the server, I blame the 4 bartenders that was just chatting with each other).  We ordered 2 appetizers and it took 12 mins to hit our table, it was not hot and it tasted like it was left on the expo window for a good minute. Server didn't come back once to ask about our appetizers. Same thing happened with our main entrees! Our table next to us which got sat 35mins after we got there, got their food before us?! How does that happen?!  I'm very disappointed with the manager on duty, he didn't do anything even after the server told him about the wait time. I wanted to tell the manager about my experience but he was too busy standing there by the bar doing nothing!  I would not recommend this place to anyone!",

Not many places were open for dinner and after walking aimlessly around downtown Pittsburgh for an hour we literally stumbled upon this place. We walked in scanned the menu quickly and were seated right after.   The drink options/specials were reasonably priced at $7 to $9 and the ambiance was great. All the hostess and waiters seemed welcoming.   The food. The food. The food. Unfortunately, the menu item I ordered isn't listed on M&P's website. It doesn't seem like they've updated since 2017 but I can say that my dish was I believe a lamb chop with either quinoa or couscous. There were a variety of vegetables and sauces and the flavors were SO GOOD. The flavor I cannot speak enough about. I really did savor every bite. My brother ordered the pappardelle and said although the pasta was a little bit more on the dente side of al dente, it was still very delicious.   This is for sure a place I'd return to for another speical occassion.",

In the past 6 years of eating there, while I may occasionally try a few different items, I keep pretty consistent with my favorite meal.  One, the barrel aged Manhattans they serve are my favorite.  If you like Manhattans or Old Fashioned(s) you can't go wrong with either.  The fried pickles and grilled bread (or as some call it, toast) are both great appetizers.  The bread comes with a butter and jam that often change but have always been popular.  In the end, it's the Pub Burger that does not help the waistline but is as emotionally satisfying as any food can be.  A number of items (and other good sandwiches) have come and gone on the menu, but this stable has stood the test of time and I'd highly recommend it.    I'd also recommend sharing as some of the portions on the meals can be a bit much if it's the beginning of your evening downtown.",

My biggest complaint is that the sticky bun we shared was cold. It came in a mini cast iron skillet on a plate, one would think it would be hot or at least gooey and warm. Nope, cold. I had scrambled eggs (very good) and the house-made granola (with house-made yogurt, honey, and berries). Very large portions. I liked the granola and yogurt. My husband had the breakfast Americano, he liked it. Also, I made my reservation through their website weeks in advanced. I emailed a few days before to confirm my reservation, I got an autogenerated email back that said I'd hear back within a day, never heard back. Also I didn't find anyone to be that friendly (hostess, server).",

I thought it was very reasonable at $12 for a downtown eatery, which appears to be laid back but upscale. I ordered a beer on tap (only a few to choose from) which was kinda pricey $8. My spouse had the seasonal salad $9 with heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. It looked very small (like 2 lettuce leafs in it) but he sd it was tasty. He also ordered the buffalo Mac n cheese appetizer. It was pretty small, but he sd the chicken in it was delicious. Our waitress wasn't the most attentive but friendly at least.",

To be honest, I wanted to try multiple things on the menu but only got the flatbread because I wanted something kind of on the lighter side in comparison to the rest of the menu.  However, the entire menu sounds amazing and definitely want to come back for more and even for brunch.   Saw a few people with the huge steak for two - it is HUGE. Looks awesome though and definitely an experience.   Also, our server was so kind in explaining the menu and what is popular. Really took the time to explain and it was much appreciated.

    "text": "*HIGHLY RECOMMEND*  After telling myself I will eat here one day for the past 3 years, I finally did. I came in with high expectations especially from all the raved reviews over the years, and let me tell you...IT WAS AMAZZINGGG!!! My eyes have been set on the 45oz ribeye ever since my friend told me about it when she came here a while back. Of course if you're planning to go to Meat and Potatoes, you better get the meat and the potatoes. So we ordered the 45oz ribeye (medium rare) with the chimichurri sauce, a side of rosemary potatoes, and a side of the roasted cauliflower. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes for them to cook that ribeye, it was worth the wait.  45oz Ribeye:  Oh My God, it was HUGE and the medium rare was PERFECT! No blood at all but rare enough. Even though it was difficult to cut the steak, it wasn't chewy or hard. The bone marrow that came with it melted in my mouth . Both the ribeye and the bone marrow were well seasoned. Tbh, this piece of steak is good for 3 people, I had to take some home because I couldn't finish it. And that chimichurri sauce is like a mixture of olive oil and cilantro. Surprisingly good on the steak.   Rosemary Potatoes: Very fragrant. The potatoes were so soft. I personally prefer crispier potatoes but it was still good.   Roasted Cauliflower: I've never had roasted cauliflower, but boy, was it good. I really enjoyed the raisins they put in it, making it a savory yet sweet dish. The cauliflower was pretty well done and soft. It definitely pairs well with the steak.  FINAL VERDICT: Would I go back again? YES  Would I get the Meat and Potatoes for 2 again? Probably not because it was hella expensive and I'm a poor college student. But it was definitely a woexperience",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place.  I was in the area visiting the Pittsburgh and the Warhol museum for a short few hours and ended up here based on their menu, review and location. I asked for a table for one outside and had to wait for them to be cleaned up. 10-15 minutes later I was seated outside with 5 other cleaned and now Set empty tables. I shouldn't have needed to wait for everything to be cleaned. Fine.   Next step: the waitress was really nice and I quickly placed an order.  Chicken and waffles + a mimosa.  Sounds like a great Saturday meal.  Water and my mimosa came out fairly quickly. This was followed a few minutes later by the food.  If you like a lot of food, this particular order hit. It came with a mountain of chicken (3 large pieces rather than the 2 typical at many other places). This was over a large waffle. I was overwhelmed but happy with the portion, underwhelmed with the spiciness of the chicken (I ordered the spicy option), so I ordered hot sauce on the side.   As I enjoy the chicken and begin to look down, I noticed the waffle was soaked in what appeared to be grease or oil. This ofcourse is a complete turnoff. There was so much oil that I asked for a side plate to separate the waffle from chicken and asked the waitress if perhaps it was a special sauce. She admitted it was chicken grease but shouldn't be soaked through the waffle like that. She offered to bring a new waffle out and she did. She was quite nice about it and totally understood, but I was pretty turned off from that moment.   Like I get it....I don't eat chicken n' waffles expecting a healthy meal, but when you see a grease soaked through waffle, it's a bit traumatic. I just started envisioning clogged arteries and somewhat lost my appetite. I'm sure that's why most places don't put the chicken directly on top of the waffle.   So that's a no for me on my specific meal (try something other than chicken and waffles), a yes on the service, a no on the random wait time, a yes on the general food and drink options, a yes for the location - close to other restaurants, activities, the Warhol museum and baseball field-  and a yes for having indoor and outdoor seating options.",

I made reservations before hand so I'm not sure if one could get in without a reservation.  They didn't seem overwhelmingly busy for a weekend night.  There's a gorgeous bar in the middle of the restaurant and tables that surround it.    Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and quick.  The bartender made a delicious mocktail that wasn't on their signature cocktail menu.  My husband and I split the 45oz ribeye steak with chimichurri sauce, bone marrow, and au gratin. Oh my, the ribeye is as big as my head!  We ventured into our dish head first and we came with big appetites because I had previewed the menu before-hand.  I think we had just a few potatoes au gratin left over but we left completely stuffed and happy!  I would highly highly recommend this place to anyone in the Pittsburgh area!",

There looks to be outdoor seating as well, I chose a table inside.    The food was very good.  Like most of my work trips, I had been up since 4 and skipped lunch, so I was starving by the time I got to Meat and Potatoes for dinner.  I started with the buttermilk fried chicken livers that were served with a slightly spicy chipotle remoulade (a good low calorie start to the meal).  They were very good.  The chipotle sauce was the perfectly spicy companion to the rich livers.  Then I had the bolognese with pappardelle, also delicious.  The bolognese was made with pancetta and good size pieces of tender pork shoulder in a delicious tomato sauce.  The service was very good.  Since I wasn't in a hurry to get back to my hotel I took my time reading and enjoying my meal and a glass of wine or two.  The server checked in on me from time to time, made good recommendations, but wasn't annoying.",

    "text": "Okay--let's begin. Que arrival: promptly greeted as soon as we entered the doors. We had a 1:15 reservation for 2 for brunch. I read Butcher & Rye for dinner and Meat & Potatoes for brunch was the \"call\" according to the internet. Me being the sheep I am when it comes to unknown cities- I obeyed. We arrived at around 12:45 and the host said our reservation would be ready by 1:15. We sat at the bar in the meantime to grab a drink. Sunday funday baby. I was immediately intrigued by the Bloody Mary bar situation. The bartenders seemed to be getting hit with the last wave of server tickets so I wasn't mad that I wasn't immediately acknowledged. But now it had been about five minutes and we still were not even greeted. Being forgotten or ignored is super awkward. Finally a male bartender got around to us and my boyfriend had a beer (can) and I inquired about the BM's. They didn't have the bacon infused vodka *sigh* so I ordered the Old Bay infused. The bartender pours the vodka and then it's free game. I walked to the end of the bar to make my bloody. Their selection was impressive: I added celery salt, old bay, horseradish, and hot sauce. Their hot sauce selection was impressive. I decorated my BM with SHRIMP, bacon, celery, a FREAKING CHICKEN WING, assorted deli meat and pepperoncini! All of this was in/on my BM for $9... $9. SO WORTH IT. The wing was fantastic as were the shrimp. I loved it! 1:13 rolls around and the host comes up to us to let us know our reservation is ready when we are. We closed out at the bar and made way to our seats. The cushion and the chairs in the dining room were very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is being SO CLOSE to the people on my left and right. I barely have room to put my bag next to me on either side. I'm easily distracted... so I hate hearing the person next door's conversation.  The server-seemed possibly new? She was fine she just seemed nervous or anxious. She wasn't confident when she spoke. We started with the sticky bun... it was just okay, kind of dry. It wasn't as soft and gooey as I would've expected it to be. Our meals arrive: chicken and waffles and the Philly cheesesteak. The chicken and waffles was my boyfriends meal- WOW there were four gigantic pieces of fried chicken on his plate. They were super crispy and tender on the inside; such a perfect balance. The syrup was warm and only highlighted the dish. My philly- not going to lie, very mediocre. The roll had this strange smell to it and I couldn't put my finger on it. I'm a bread LOVER and this bread was chewy and tough. The meat was very fatty and I just don't enjoy gagging while I'm eating. The cheese on the philly was great but that's about it. I was so sad too because the philly is almost highlighted in the menu; it's placed in its own special box on the paper menu. The fries were just... fries. I believe they had a slight rosemary taste but they weren't anything out of this world. I typically don't expect much out of fries.  I ordered a second drink- the nitro caramel martini and between the martini and the bloody- this was the BEST part of the meal. If I would've known the food was going to not be so stellar (or the philly in particular) I would've just ordered a second BM and got the chance to eat more wings and shrimp.  I don't know if I would recommend eating here as much as I would invite others to drink!",

    "text": "I now remember why I avoid meat & potatoes - service.  I keep trying to give Meat and Potatoes more chances - but I always leave disappointed.  My friend and i visited Meat and Potatoes on Saturday for brunch.  Our hostess didn't know what end was up.  After over 15 minutes of watching folks bus tables around us (outside), wait on other tables, bring food to other tables - my friend finally asked the hostess if we had a waiter.    Our waitress FINALLY came and took our food order.  And took the water bottle as it was empty (so I was expecting a new one).  Our appetizers came - along with my friends drink.  But no water.  Water was my drink of choice, due to a recent health scare that's about all I can drink. (We finally got water after our food was served...and I asked a bus boy who was taking our plates).  We got a couple side plates to start us off.  No appetizer plates.  Just dropped them and left.  So - I got them myself.  Here's hoping the pile of plates were clean!  We didn't see our waitress again till she had our bill in hand ready to get a clear table.  She never checked on our food, nor did the 5 additional people that came by (I started counting).    In regards to the food - the food was decent.  I was disappointed that my brisket hash bowl was almost filled with grease.  Not a little grease (which is reasonable) A LOT of grease.    The problem is the service.  It desperately needs to be fixed.  My previous reviews said the same thing.  It hasn't been fixed.  I was really hoping for improvement.",

The food was flavorful, well seasoned, and plentiful. I would recommend coming here. The only negative I would say is the waitstaff seemed rushed. At one point a server attempted to take my plate as I was taking a bite. I told him I wasn't done yet...it was weird. Otherwise it was a positive experience.",

    "text": "Wifey and I decided to use a night alone for a hot date. We left the hotel and started walking with a couple of places in mind and decided on Meat & Potatoes. Luckily, they had some open tables in the 'secondary' seating area...the hostess described it as having a 'different vibe'. 'Different vibe' was code for the back room with some louder music and more lighting...we were perfectly fine with it.   Our waiter, Storm, took our drink orders quickly and we checked out the menu. The menu wasn't huge, which I like...do something right with a few items instead of trying too hard with a lot of different dishes.    We got our drinks (me a Manhattan and Wifey had a Dark and Stormy) and we started with the Mushroom risotto appetizer topped with shaved Parmesan. Kind of an odd choice for us but this was out of this world. Creamy, savory...just amazing  For our entrees I ordered the NY strip medium rare with smashed sweet potatoes m, mushrooms and Swiss chard. Wifey had the Short Rib with polenta roasted carrots and pearl onions. We also ordered a side of fried Brussels sprouts.   When the meals came out I wasn't sure it was going to fill me up, but it was plenty of food and beautifully presented. My strip was a little on the rare side, but it was delicious and I'd rather have it a little rare than overdone. The combination of flavors in this dish brought perfection with each bite. The sweetness of the potatoes, the salty savoriness of the steak, the woody flavor of the mushrooms and the slight bitterness in the chard all complemented each other amazingly.   Wifey also loved her meal though she said it needed just a slight touch of salt. The short rib was cooked beautifully and combined very nicely with the polenta. And the fried Brussels were amazingly rich and full of flavor...probably my new favorite way of having them.   Both of us were so stuffed we skipped dinner and went out to walk the city a little more. A little pricey, but the food was amazing, service was excellent, the ambiance was perfect for us and the place was spotless and fun. A five star meal!",

It is both rustic (with whiskey bottles and antlers) but also trendy (lots of mirrors and cool incandescent lighting) I had to drive back so I couldn't drink but their bloody Mary's look amazing We got the pork belly hash which reminds me of Chinese pork belly and I loved it.  We got the Nashville hot chicken and waffles. The chicken was seasoned well (not spicy though) and very tender. The waffle was good too but the grease from the chicken gave it this very salty fatty taste. I think your supposed to eat them together but I realized in this dish, I prefer it separately. I just ate the pieces of the waffle that didn't touch the chicken. The waffle was chewy and delicious.",

This was our first time at the restaurant so he did provide good suggestions when we were between two appetizers.  We went with the Fried Taters with Truffle Mayo.  They were delicious but very rich!!   For our entrees I had the Flat Iron Steak, and my husband had the NY Strip Loin Oscar.  Both were great!  Cooked perfectly - medium rare for both of us - and well seasoned.   All of the sides that came with my Flat Iron were delicious and went well with the steak.  I'm a self-proclaimed picky eater but I absolutely enjoyed everything that was on my plate.  It is pricey - but for a night out to celebrate a special occasion it was well worth it!  We will definitely be returning!",

Perfect at medium-rare and teamed up wonderfully with the accompanying pierogies, etc. The only thing I wasn't terribly keen on was the dressing for the greens. The flavor was a tad overpowering/bitter. And I tend to like bitter. My date and I also split the prosciutto mac n cheese and the fried pickles before the meal. Both perfection, although in retrospect we ordered waaaay too much food for just the two of us.

    "text": "This place is a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.  It's been on my list for quite awhile and I finally got there on my recent visit to the burgh.  A friend and I risked it without reservations and met at 6, we were lucky and easily snagged 2 seats at the bar.  This place is small - it took me awhile to realize that the mirrors on the walls around the place were just that - mirrors and that the place wasn't huge.  I started with the Old Fashion and she went with the Brandy Buck.  Both drinks were delicious.  We both had a hard time trying to decide what to order because everything sounded great.  Finally, I was sucked in by the brussel sprout kim chi on the Koren Ruben - and boy, I'm glad I was.  This was hands down one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.  First of all, it was gigantic - I swear the sandwich weighed about 3 pounds.  Thick pieces of some sort of bread - it was hard to tell with all the goodness sandwiched between the bread.  A big pile of delicious corned beef, swiss cheese and then that brussel sprout kim chi.  I think I could eat that stuff by the bowl.  Not only was the sandwich massive, but it was accompanied by a huge bowl of pretty good fries.  And it also had some sort of delicious sauce on the side - I think it was supposed to be thousand island, but it tasted suspiciously like the sriracha tzatziki that came with one of the daily specials.  I didn't really care, it too was awesome.  My friend opted for dessert while I went for another drink.  Her lemon passionfruit cheesecake was amazing.  My wine was pretty good too.  The service was great and the food was amazing.  This place has earned itself a stop on my regular rotation.  Yum!",

    "text": "Caveat:  I ate neither meat nor potatoes, but I think I tried everything else on the menu.   The atmosphere is ...a little weird.  You have enter through the theater, but once inside the restaurant it's great.  Sort of French bistro meets bordello.  (That makes sense to me).  The chairs at the tables are realllllly comfortable, so much so that we were afraid we were going to fall asleep after eating and drinking too much.   We started with a bevy of appetizers - short ribs flatbread with arugula and gorgonzola was very tasty, as were the fried chicken livers.  The bone marrow, though, took the day.  It was a *huge* portion - easily three times what I've had in other restaurants.    For dinner I had the pappardelle, my second choice because they were out of veal shank.  It was excellent - and you can always rely upon me to get pasta no matter where I go.  The noodles were definitely homemade by someone, and the sauce had more flavor than most bologneses I've tried.  Lesley had the \"Pig dip,\" which looked amazing.  Erin was less than thrilled with the Kobe beef, but Tim loved his hot dog.  Yes, a $12 hot dog.  Apparently it was worth the price.   The big hiccup was the service.  Our waitress was unfriendly and inattentive.  The place was not busy (it was a Tuesday), so I couldn't understand why it took so long to have plates cleared and drinks refilled.  That said, the food more than makes up for it.",

That may work in an Italian place with lots of ambiance and where the wine is not expensive, but here it just came off as cheap. Wine at these prices should be served in wine glasses.",

The chicken was tasteful tender and juicy. My only complaint is the round tables tend to be on the small side and can make eating slightly uncomfortable if you have more than two plates and drinks.",

It was cooked medium - juicy, flavorful, and the egg on top was creative and added to the overall experience. The fries on the side were, meh, but it didn't matter because the burger was beyond this world! The bun was soft and buttery, made in house. DH had the snapper topped with papaya salad. It was a light yet satisfying dish. We finished dinner with the cinnamon almond panna cotta (it was the special). It was just ok, but I'm sure that had we tried a different dessert, we would have been very pleased. We will definitely visit this place again the next time we're in town.",

Good city spot - but there is no manager presence and they are really not focused on great service! Good to be in the theater district i guess!  Took a seat at the bar before a show! good crowd, lots of energy!  The menu is innovative, and very tavern-ish in some ways... i.e. great place to get a good drink and eat something!  just a good ol steak with a  potato is what i was expecting, sorry I was born and raised in these parts! took the name too literally..it is worth mentioning that burger (which is something i would prefer to make at home!) was good. Salad and flat bread were good. Service is where they took a hit with me; just not very customer focused - i was left to feel that i wasn't a recognizable face in the crowd -one drink in a 80 minute period???  a bartender (all of 23 maybe) was more interested in how he was holding his bar spoon and stirring than actually preparing drinks... let alone the 7 minutes to make one drink while telling a gentleman next to us that he was a master mixologist and blah blah blah blah... maybe if you had a grey hair kid you could pull that shtick off but your knowledge of bourbon and scotch (good job reading) is limited and you need to keep your ego in check!  You haven't been alive long enough to know that much!  Make my drink and ask me if i would like another before my drink is empty and its time to leave!  I guess it was forbiden that one of the 42 other people behind the bar hep us!  please note - he made good drink, but anyone can be taught to measure and stir! WAS that detailed enough team?

    "text": "Are you ready for manly man food served in a manly man setting?  I am!  And thankfully, so was Belle.  I say manly man with my tongue in cheek since M&P owes much to chefs like Gabrielle Hamilton and April Bloomfield, both of whom have been kicking ass in NYC for a few years now.  Bone marrow on toast may be the single most ripped off dish of the last decade or so--this place takes it from Hamilton, who stole it from Fergus Henderson.  Is that a problem?  No!  Bone marrow isn't something you really expect to see on many Pittsburgh menus, so I won't call into question any cook's motives if I end up eating it.  Smack in the middle of the theater district, M&P is a good date spot--the lighting ranges from \"romantic\" to \"theoretical.\"  Yes, it's convenient, but more importantly it offers you many chances to put your date in situations in which you can evaluate him/her as a prospect.  1. It has a good bar.  If I have to explain to a bartender on Carson St. what goes into a Blood & Sand, I don't want that guy making a Blood & Sand.  Or anything.  But that's not the case here, so you can observe what your date drinks given a wide array of options.  Guys manage to screw this up all the time and yes, girls notice.  Beer (12 oz?  Before dinner?) and lite [sic] beer (ever?) will doom you.  Ordering something like absinthe (available here) is doable, but for God's sake don't go into some overly-long explanation about the green fairy.  Absinthe hasn't been like that for ages.  That's like getting excited about drinking dairy because before refrigeration, it was a risky proposition.  2. Its menu takes a small token of skill to decode.  Every restaurant is required by law (-ish) to have the following items on the menu: random, bland chicken breast dish; chocolate dessert with a lavish description (pick from: forbidden/dream/fantasy/some other erotic term that reinforces the unhealthy cultural relationship between women and food); fish with really boring sides; pasta (usually vegetarian, giving non-carnivores and the thrifty an option).  At a bad restaurant, you stick to these because it's hard to really really screw up pasta, but at a good restaurant, you skip these because the cook just put them on the menu as a nod to less adventurous eaters--certainly not you!  I have never had the salmon at M&P.  I'm sure it's fine.  Salmon is tough to screw up.  I will never have M&P's salmon.  Why would you ever go to a place with pictures of cows and pigs on the wall, a place obviously intended to be a shrine to all things pork and beef and order fish?  It's clearly not the passion of the chef and can be safely skipped.  So if your date orders the salmon, the ravioli, or even the \"Plain Jane\" burger, be wary.  3. If your dining companion orders any beef dish from a place like this well done, make an excuse and leave.   M&P is not a pretentious place, but it takes its meat seriously.  Don't let someone insult the cooks or the food like that.  When I order something well done (once every 3 years), I'm saying, \"I assume the kitchen in this diner is a festering pit of bacteria and this is the only way I can think of to kill it all.\"  With all these lessons in mind, Belle and I ordered a sea of appetizers (marrow, tartare, and so on) and a lamb entree to split.  Aside from perhaps a little too much binder in the tartare and slightly uninspiring accompaniments with the lamb, everything was excellent.  Nothing life altering, just tasty, solid food that was fun to eat.   This place takes its muscular eating seriously--steaks are served on cutting boards, wine is served in jars, everything has capers.  It's a gastropub, which means no one is going to be blown away by some intricate little molecular trick the kitchen uses.  But if you're in the mood for a plate of bones straight out of the Flintstones to be placed in front of you, this is your place.",

BUT - Two of three bartenders were rude, condescending, and just plain mean.  One in particular criticized our drinks choices, sneered a lot and was otherwise thought he was very cool - obviously too cool for us.  Compared to NYC bars I have been in this week, the service was much more unfriendly and haughtier here = the attitudes here make this a place I would not recommend to friends- has potential but some new staff is needed.

Meat and Potatoes, IMO, blows that out of the water. The portions and the quality more than make up for what some have called pricey. Personally, I don't think this place is expensive, it all depends on what you get. Everything I've had here is on point, and even if you are stuffed, make sure you leave room for dessert, as their rotating lists of desserts are all so delicious. Most recently I went for my birthday dinner, which happened to be during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. The chef's menu theme was Southern, and every single course was exceptional, particularly the Chicken Waffle Tacos and Pecan Bread Pudding. If I had been home, I would have licked those plates!",

    "text": "I have been to restaurants all over the country for over twenty years and let me tell you that this restaurant is now one of my top five experiences. Not only was the food amazing, but even more impressive than that was the service. While most people were dressed a little more than casual, I walked in with my family in nice jeans and a hoodie (Thanks Yelp). We didn't even get a second glance and were treated like any other customer. Everyone from the host to the waiter was so friendly and wanted to make sure we had an excellent experience.  On to the food.... wow! Spectacular! To start, we got an order of the fried brussels, fries, devils on horseback, and mac & cheese. Everything was fantastic. The devils on horseback is a dish completely unique to this establishment (I've never had it anywhere else or even heard of it) and the mac & cheese was so rich and hearty. The chorizo and pulled pork are perfectly balanced in it to ensure that you get tons of flavor without it being too heavy of a dish. You have to order these two things if you go here.  For our main courses, my wife got the Pork Chop and I got one of the specials (Black Bass with Squash Soup). Be prepared  to eat if you get the pork chop because it's as big as your head. The pork chop comes with a couple of slices of brisket on top to accentuate the dish and was delicious. The black bass comes with a cranberry relish and a small dish of the squash soup, which you are apparently supposed to pour around your bass to get a perfect combination of flavors. That is exactly what it was, a perfect combination of flavors. The soup itself was great and the taste of all those elements combined was superb.  We got the chocolate pot de creme for desert, which was like a chocolate mousse. Like the rest of the meal, it did not disappoint. Rich without being overbearing .  If you are only in Pittsburgh for a day and are looking for one hell of a dining experience, you HAVE to go here. For people with younger children, they have high chairs so go enjoy yourselves.",

The tables are close together, but it is cozy. The dim lights make the atmosphere romantic. I drooled over the marinated olives! Be careful though, as the olives do contain their pits. I also enjoyed one of their 3 flavors of mussels of the day, a beer and mustard green concoction with chunks of bacon. The bacon soaked the beer flavoring up and tasted potent!  The broth left after devouring the muscles was the consistency of a soup. The server brought me garlic bread to dip in it. This place does have coat check which helps to save space at the tables.  Speaking of tables, they are pretty small but the staff is quick to get your used dishes out of the way before the next course is presented.",

Personally, we decided to order a bunch of appetizers to munch on versus a full meal.  We started with the fried pickles and mussels with beer broth.  The fried pickles were possibly the best I ever had with thick cut pickles and a delicious dipping sauce.  The mussels were very good, not my favorite, but very fresh tasting.  If I went back, I would try the curry broth which we heard was fantastic.  We then ordered the watermelon salad, short rib flat bread, wings and mac n' cheese.  Every item we ordered was amazing.  My favorites were the short rib flat bread and wings.  The short rib was so smoky and cooked to perfection.  The combination on the flat bread was mouth watering.  The wings were spicy and smoky at the same time.  I'm not a huge wing lover, but I would order these again and again.  Lastly, the drinks were amazing.  My fiance ordered the Pimms Blue Ribbon and it was very refreshing.  I ordered the daquiri and agree that it was a very light drink.    Everyone else around us ordered the pork chop, poutine, and a number of other appetizers.  The one that stood out was the pork chop which was cooked to perfection and had a delightful pancetta topping.  We all tried a bite and it was to die for!  All in all, an amazing experience!",

We started with drinks from the bar, then kept ordering food. The tuna taquitos for him to start and the moules of the day for me. The ahi was delicious and a creamy spread of fresh avocado inside the crunchy shell made for a nice handheld appetizer. My mussels were packed with flavor and unique. We also had an order of the chorizo mac 'n cheese, which we both managed to eat quickly.   Atmosphere is fabulous. What a cool spot. Our server was okay - he wasn't overly helpful when I asked about a few of the specialty cocktails nor did I feel he was good at recommending items. Oh well. We still had a great night at M&P. My man ordered the burger (medium rare) and fries and loved it. Full from the mussels I ordered the devils on horseback appetizer which were the most perfect trio of stuffed dates wrapped in a slightly salty bacon. For dessert we shared the dirt pudding, reminiscent of our childhood years with layers of chocolately rich pudding and crushed oreos. The adult version was so good.   One of our favorite dining experiences while in Pittsburgh. Kudos, Meat and Potatoes!",

The environment and ambiance were amazing. The place has a nice atmosphere that prepares you for the food experience to come. Service is nice, fast and helpful. Everything we tried was great and I have to recommend the three pigs sandwich. Also the plates we saw in other tables seemed delicious as well. We will definitely visit this place again and I am highly recommending it!",

I wasn't the biggest fan of the duck but everything was still amazing nonetheless. Our server was absolutely great but I've also got a give props to the runners and bussers as they were right on top of things. We're not generally fans of dimly lit restaurants but they nailed it because the ambiance was still inviting and embraced a neo-prohibition era feel. Wonderful experience!",

This place resonates with you well after you leave in positive vibes!   The decor is welcoming and warm with a successful blend of early 20th century artifacts and hip contemporary design and color. The menu is intense and truly a carb fiesta! Beers in the house are plentiful in selection and the service was outstanding. The server knows the brews, recommends wonderful ales that accompany whatever choice from the menu . This is now a staple for me on each visit to the steel city. Try it, you will not be disappointed! Excellent experience and meal.",

    "text": "It's a surprisingly small space and despite a number of bar seats it still appears impossible to get one.  Make a reservation, don't count calories, and enjoy.  Artisan cocktails are outstanding, definitely the best I've had in Pittsburgh and they easily measure up against my home town of New Orleans.  The wine and beer lists are also very well chosen so just about everyone will be happy (other than my colleague who always orders Bud Light, which they don't carry here).  On the appetizer menu, poutine is fantastic (and this is coming from someone who worked in Montreal for a year) if you like the combination of fries, cheese curds & brown gravy.  The lobster spring roll was really good, and the tartare was also excellent - let's just say there are very few places that I would ever order tartare but this is one.  The Fall Salad is also great and the sashimi was fine but didn't blow me away.  In terms of main courses the signature 34 ounce ribeye (which most restaurants would call a \"Tomahawk\" or \"Cowboy\" cut) was shared by my table on my initial visit and I have to say the meat was cooked perfectly and had great flavor but overall it just had way too much fat.  Of course, the accompanying fries and bone marrow gratin were also good.  The surprise hit of the meal however was the pasta - great homemade papardelle with a perfect short rib bolognese sauce and very good agnolotti with a brown butter sauce and some veggies although the shape & size of the pasta wasn't typical for agnolotti.  The short rib flatbread was also very good and the only real miss on 2 visits so far was a mushroom flatbread that had a strange ricotta spread for the cheese and just didn't have much flavor.  Nothing is perfect but everything from the decor to the service to the food are done well at Meat & Potatoes and I'll definitley be back - assuming I can get a reservation.",

    "text": "Tried this place for dinner earlier this week on a biz trip to Pittsburgh.  I did not realize it was in the theater district of the city, which makes the location busier and more commercial than I was expecting.  I was hoping for something with more of a neighborhood feel, which this place definitely does not have.  It's right in the middle of a touristy part of downtown, so keep this in mind if you're trying to eat before a performance at one of the nearby theaters.... waits for a table seemed to be high, even on a weeknight.  Having said that, I found a seat at the very busy bar (just after 7:00pm on a Tues night), and proceeded to order one of the house specialties, the smoked pork chop, with baked beans and spicy apple slaw on the side.  This was probably the best damned pork chop I've had in my life, and was about 3\" thick (two ribs worth of the loin)!  Very tender and flavorful.  My bartender/server warned me it wasn't the fastest item to come out of the kitchen, but it was not a long wait.  I had the summer salad before, which was just OK.  All of their beers are either served on tap or in cans, and they have a decent selection.  I finished off with their coconut flan, which was outstanding.  My bill was $56, with a nice tip.  Service was fairly quick considering how busy the place was, and very competent and friendly.  I would try it again, but probably with a reservation.",

We continued on with our night, paid the tab and went home. The next morning, my husband noticed that someone had added an extra $20 tip to the tip that we left on our bill.

My favorite part is the bloody mary bar! They have a choice of several infused tequilas or vodkas and a wide range of accoutrements that you can add to create your own masterpiece (as you can see from some of my photos here).  I particularly love the shrimp and bacon options.  As far as entrees go, I love how they regularly change up their menu so there's always something new to try.  I've tried several items on their brunch menu and I haven't had a bad thing yet and the portions are always quite generous and the prices reasonable.  The service is also very attentive.  The only thing I don't like is the choice of music the dj plays at brunch which often sounds like late nigh club music rather than brunch music, though at least they keep the volume to a reasonable level so it's not too bothersome.",

I was next to the window sill which had a nice thin layer of dust.   I don't have any complaints about the service, the staff has always been friendly. The restaurant is always busy (good for them!) so I've never gotten the feeling of service that went above and beyond, and some servers are more knowledgable on the menu than others, but they are nice and they get the job done.

We ordered the lamb neck and the duck breast. The presentation looks good.  Lamb Neck is HUGE, but mostly bone. The taste is soft and tender. Again, for the price, it didn't blow me away.. but it was decent. The duck breast was also soft and tender.. good portion.  Again, the taste didn't blow me away.

Thursday night was packed, room in the dining area for reservations only.  So I wandered to the bar and found a seat.  The bartenders...these guys are the best.  Cecil (I think)...is the man.  Their cocktail list is short, but these guys know their stuff.  I opted for the Pimm's Blue Ribbon - which combines my two favorites, St. Germain and PBR.  This is a dangerously drinkable drink...I know, I had several.  The gentleman next to me had a Sazerac, which I hadn't experienced before.  This is where Cecil stepped in and gave us a vibrant and detailed history of the drink - which was awesome.  The Sazerac isn't on the cocktail list, but again these guys know their stuff, and I would recommend giving it a shot if you enjoy Rye.  Then, for food.  Well by this point I've noshed on the Brussel sprouts, and exquisite Ceasar salad, the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Banana Pie.  Brussel spouts are very good, but the dipping sauce they come with is even better.  Not potent, but buttery and smooth.  The Cesear salad is creamy, and topped with real, homemade pork rinds.  Now, these have never appealed to me before - but the crunchy texture and saltiness in contrast to the salad (topped with an egg...yes) was spot on.  Lobster mac is as pure as it can be.  I stopped in last night for dessert and tried the banana pie.  What came out was a little jar of heaven.  It was a banana bread type deal, layered with whipped cream and caramel...and there was a hint of peanut butter.  It was good.  With the bartenders and solid food, I would definitely recommend this place.  The atmosphere is upscale but casual and in a great locale.",

Never really have been let down with food options here plus they have a reasonable selection of beers. Always busy so make sure to make a reservation beforehand! I haven't had the brunch here so all my comments are for dinner but I will say I've heard good things about the brunch. It's on my to do list...  On a side note, Monday nights after 10 PM they have industry night for the folks who are in the restaurant industry. They offer $8 bites and drink specials- definitely worth checking out if you're out late on a Monday.   Food: I've eaten a number of dishes here and quite frankly have never been disappointed. It is, in True Pittsburgh fashion, rather decadent so don't go if you're on a diet. My favorites: Snacks/Apps- fried taters with black truffle mayo (the mayo really sells it in my opinion), Mac n cheese (a generous serving of mixed in chorizo packs in a nice punch of flavor; eat and expect an impending nap), fried brussels (my favorite but again, not the healthy kind your mom made you eat as a kid) Entrees- lamb burger (just all-in-all well executed burger), pork chop   Also if you're there for industry night on Monday, I believe the menu may rotate each time but if poutines are on the menu (see picture) go for Asian Persuasion and Southern Pride. Three poutine dishes was more than plenty for 4 of us following an appetizer or two.   Drinks: Had a mixed experience with cocktails here. Not all that impressed with them so if you're on the fence about a cocktail or draft beer, I'd steer towards the latter. They seem to always have a few interesting ones on tap. If you're looking for a place for a quick drink with friends downtown and are willing to stand at the bar, it's a worthwhile stop.   Ambience: Matches the food- lots of wood, warm and dimly lit. As I alluded to before, it's a nice way to prep you for the food coma to come. The place seems busy often do not a quiet romantic date spot but certainly trendy and interesting enough for a date or with a few friends. Large groups would probably be difficult to seat here- haven't tried before.   Service: Generally good although can be a bit slower when things are busy. Never had issues so far.",

The theme music would probably be The Cure or Dashboard Confessional for the group milling about there.  Not welcoming at all.  That being said, the rest of the experience is amazing!  The brunch was fantastic complete with a $7 bloody Mary bar which, in my opinion, is a steal considering the amount of things to skewer and place in your bloody.  We got the grilled bread, steak omelet (omelet of the day) and the pot roast hash.  The winners of the day were the grilled bread, the cheesy potatoes that came with the omelet, and the pot roast hash.  Our server was awesome as well.  Great place for brunch!",

    "text": "It had been awhile since my last visit to M&P, mostly because scoring a brunch reservation is about as easy as getting a hole-in-one.  But with a little planning we did it, and were really looking forward to the brunch.  I had the short rib hash, and my friends had the granola and berries and the huevos ranchero.  We had the sticky bun as an appetizer.  In order of greatness:  huevos ranchero was spicy and excellent.  The short rib hash and the granola were both good, but not great.  My hash was underwelming, the short rib meat was tender and delicious but there were only a few bites, mostly potatoes in my skillet.  The poached eggs  and horseradish sauce were the best part, and I just wanted more meat!  The presentation of the yogurt and granola was unique, and the combination of fresh berries and dried fruit made for a great texture/flavor combination, but atop two slices of raisin walnut bread it was just well...odd.  The bread was dense, so it wasn't soggy, but there was just something bland about it.  I would have loved more of the ricotta and the granola sans bread!  Last on our favorites list was the sticky bun, which was on the specials list.  First, know that the appetizer is a single sticky bun, do not be mislead by the plural form listed on the menu.  It was on the dry side, and we all just wanted to dunk it straight into our coffee. We all commented that a sticky bun is supposed to be sticky...this was more of a cinnamon roll...without icing.   Overall, it's still a great atmosphere, the DJ was a great bonus on Sunday morning before a Pirates game, cocktails looked spectacular as always.  Definitely get the heuvos ranchero, and from the looks of the table next to us...get the chicken and waffles...and share it...because it looked AMAZING!",

Our group sampled the Brussels sprouts appetizer- roasted with Parmesan cheese, and the pate, served with toasted bread in a cute little jar..very good with a sweet tang to it. I had the Mussels in a chili broth with sweet potato cubes and roasted chick peas...excellent and plentiful and a nice twist on Moules frites..I had mine with the spectacular Truffle fries with a mayo dip- that alone would suffice for a meal! My husband had the burger with pork belly and an egg...also amazing and huge. The Three little Piggy sandwich that was served could feed a family of four! I would definitely return to sample more of their fare. All was well done and huge portions. Would consider sharing next time.",

Good flavor but a few places it was too tough to eat. But, I would go back and just not order the pot roast.",

    "text": "Meat and Potatoes was my initiation into Pittsburgh cuisine and literally the first dinner meal I grabbed a few months back. The joint has a gastropub atmosphere with a bar in the center of the room and tables surrounding it. The servers/bartenders are all extremely friendly and have always been very cordial. The cocktails are delicious and well made. The decor is hip and classy which I never thought I would say about a joint. It was a Monday and I pulled up a seat at the bar and was immediately presented with menus for my perusal. I can say that ive been here a few times now since my travel started to Pittsburgh and the combined food that I have ordered has been the Mac and Cheese, parpadelle, fried taters, wagyu strip steak, etc.   The mac and cheese is really rich and even the appetizer portion is enough for a meal. If you love gooey cheese with special ingredients like brisket or lobster or foie gras, then this is your dish. There is nothing to hate about it. The parpadelle is another mouth pleaser and out of this world. The meat is perfectly tender and amazing with the sauce and pasta being the perfect compliment. I am personally a bigger fan of the dirty pasta over at butcher and the rye but this dish is a close second. The fried taters is a fancy way of saying French fries and boy do they deliver on it. This dish is a solid sharing plate for a few folks. The wagyu is the only one that I was not 100% a fan of. To me, it seemed like trying to put a fancy \"Asian\" spin and the sauce was a bit too heavy and overpowered the juiciness of the steak making it seem like it was in the passenger seat. Still solid dish but a slight disappointment amidst the other dishes that I am a big fan of.   All in all, a great joint and a spot that I visit frequently. Love the service, the food, and the vibe. Definitely recommending to any folks trying to find a solid spot.",

Very cool atmosphere, not too loud, but definitely vibrant. The folks at the Podium were super helpful and nice, and we were seated for our reservation promptly. Our server was excellent as was the libation we started with. I had the Pappardelle with pork shoulder  as my entree and its was just the right amount of delicious. I was able to finish it without feeling guilty . The best part of the meal for me was probably the dessert. It was a sort of French toast, brulee'd with caramelized sugar, baked apples, and a scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream. Garnished with dried apple and round melon-scooped fresh apple. That was probably the best thing I had eaten in a long time, I had to take a picture. I will definitely be attempting another reservation the next time I am in the area!",

I ordered 2 things: the beet salad which was so refreshing and had a beautiful presentation, and the \"Pork\" which was a MASSIVE pork chop perfectly cooked (seriously. How was the center of that thing so buttery and soft???) with 2 strips of pork belly on top. The chop chop as covered with a delicious baked beans side dish/sauce, and (because I don't like collard greens) I substituted confit potato wedges. The flavors were spot on. So smoky and tender and juicy. Ugh. So good. I was also stunned at how large my dinner was. The 2 couples on either side of me couldn't believe it either. One of them asked if they could take a picture of it. I ended having to take 1/2 of the whole meal home. I don't live in the area but if I did this would be a frequent on my least.  If there's anything negative about my experience, it was that I had a really hard time seeing my meal. I like a dark atmosphere... but I literally couldn't tell what was on my fork while I was eating the salad. Was kind of fun, though. Thanks for the delicious meal!",

Both dishes were the perfect size and were loaded with flavor! My favorite appetizer is the bone marrow.  Before visiting meat & potatoes I had never tried bone marrow before, but since then I've tried it at several other restaurants around the country and none have measured up to meat & potatoes.  My only complaint is that the tables are very close together, so I felt like the neighboring tables were listening to my conversations and I felt like I was eavesdropping on theirs.  An excellent pre-show dinner option for sure!",

I LOVE that this restaurant captures the pride & humor of the city.  ie: *Fried pickles served in a paper tray, on a silver platter with spicy ranch dressing. Ha! & Yum! *Mac-n Cheese with chorizo, pulled pork, & \"government cheese\" Yes, please!  Coat me in this ambrosia & walk away. *Perfectly cooked Pastrami crusted duck served with sauerkraut pierogies & dandelion greens-- BRILLIANT.  The entire menu is peppered with \"wink wink, nudge nudge\" moments--like puns but with food.  This is exactly what i want from a gastropub--refined & delicious food that isn't stuffy.  These are ingredients you WANT TO EAT paired or prepared in unexpected ways.  The restaurant is a bit loud, but still quite comfortable.  I was ecstatic to see a proper cocktail menu in Pittsburgh & recommend the Up In Smoke--the whiskey balances the salty smorgasbord before you.  Go with a group, order everything & share.  The portions are generous & the plates are lick-the-china delicious.",

For entree we split the lamb burger which was my first time having lamb as a burger. It was good juicy and had a really good sauce.

No matter what day of the week it's bustling.    Food: On my first visit, my party guest and I shared the ribeye for two.  It came with bone marrow which was okay.  I like bone marrow but the consistency of this one didn't work for me, the gratin style wasn't working for me with the marrow.  The ribeye also came with a side of fries.  Additionally, we ordered a side of fried brussel sprouts.  The sides were ordinary, nothing special.  On my second visit, I ordered the moules w/white wine and frites.  The balance of flavors was right on.  The portion size was generous.  If there was a negative - and it really technically wasn't a negative - was that they put chorizo with the moules.  Service: Attentive enough not to be overbearing; friendly.  Ambience: Very lively.  Music is a bit loud but makes for the energetic atmosphere.",

We are glad we did, and are considering coming back for brunch tomorrow on our way out of town. This place has great ambiance, friendly staff and AMAZING food. The seating was a little close (a long bench with chairs on the opposite sides for parties of 2) but that just meant we made some instant friends. Our server was professional and nice and our dinners arrived quickly and looked great. I had the pot roast w/whipped potatoes and my husband had the Papperdelle Pasta w rib tips. We shared and I have to say the Papperdelle wins. The sauce is delectable, the noodles cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back for this! My pot roast was a smidgen dry but it was still extremely delicious. Overall our experience here was fantastic and I highly recommend come here for dinner (be sure to make reservations in advance, they fill up fast). BRAVO!",

The cocktails that were ordered:  First Word: my new favorite and have ordered each subsequent visit to the restaurant!  Desperado: delicious tequila cocktail, but a definite punch!   The Food:  Fried Pickles (these were good, but my husband has had better)  Fried Brussels (a must order.  Delicious!) Bone Marrow (absolutely amazing!) Tartare (I wasn't a huge fan of the peanuts featured in it, but the beef was delicious)  Risotto (delicious, but more toothsome than other versions I have had)  Caesar Salad (absolutely delicious with a perfectly cooked fried egg and delicious pig ears!) Mussels (delicious and huge!)   Went again last night and had:  First Word cocktail (I can't say enough about this delicious drink!)  Caesar Salad (awesome)  Meat and Potatoes for two (ordered rare and it was spot on!  The bone marrow, mushrooms, and confit potatoes were great accompaniments!)

The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite nice, though the lighting is quite dark so if some people have trouble with that do be aware.  The cocktails available at Meat and Potatoes are also phenomenal.  I personally really enjoy their barrel-aged Manhattans; I don't know the last time I had a Manhattan that good.

It took a reservation made several weeks in advance to finally make it but once we were seated in the special \"group room\" and the menus came out, it was clear that the wait was worth it.  To start with, we were enticed by the make-your-own-bloody mary bar with a variety of pickled vegetables and sauces to complement one of the many unique bases.  This was good, but others were happier with their expert-prepared cocktails.  All of the dishes ordered by our group were excellent.  True to the restaurant's name there were about 15% of the items on the menu which were vegetarian options.  However, we enjoyed our meaty offerings:  Chicken and waffles with a uniquely cheesy jalapeno savory waffle, light pancakes deemed \"the best pancakes I've ever had,\" short rib hash, etc.  Come with a group so you can mooch off of others' entrees!",

    "text": "This is one that Yelp gets right, with a 4 star rating.  It's a pretty basic name for a place that serves above average food; bar service is a bit of a \"show\" and the place is packed as well.  Staff was very friendly, pasta and steak were pretty good and the value - you can't argue with.  I must say, they have very straightforward, yet meaty and well prepared wings.  Beer selection was a bit limited and, of course, focused on the microbrews... much like the rest of Pittsburgh apparently (and the rest of the country right now).  Overall a pleasant, moderately priced experience.  I can see why it's so popular.",

Me and my 2 guests had salmon and duck entrees w/pierogies, a delicious flatbread starter with roasted mushrooms and truffle, and watermelon and Waldorf salads. Music selection was terrible, but the food made me forget it momentarily. Really \"Car Wash\" from the 70s in the background?",

    "text": "I've gone to Meat & Potatoes twice and ordered the bone marrow appetizer ($18) both times. It is definitely an experience I believe everyone should try. At first, it is really hard to wrap your head around the concept, but once you do it, you realize the buttery steak taste is something you can get no where else. By the second time you order this appetizer, you are desensitized to the idea of eating marrow and it is not as big of a shocker. The menu options range from appetizers, salads, flat breads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta and main courses. I ordered the waldorf salad and it was wonderful! It tasted like a fresh picked mixtures of lettuce, fruit and \"green goddess dressing.\" I also ordered the \"Meat & Potatoes for Two\" (34 oz ribeye), which I wasn't too impressed with for $59. I would get it again for the experience though, seeing as how it's a 34 oz ribeye to share and isn't too common of a experience at other restaurants I've been to. Although exotic, their drinks are not very tasty. I ordered the \"25th hour\" drink ($9) which had lavender agave in it, but I didnt taste much lavender. It was a dry tasting, bitter drink. I would be open to trying more drinks though. As far as going for dinner, the place gets cramped (tables/seats are pretty close together) and there are an overwhelming amount of people at the bar. Getting to the bathroom is a challenge when the people at the bar won't move aside for you, which can be irritating, but this would not keep me from going at dinner time! I do recommend this place to someone who is willing to try a fancier, exotic restaurant with a great price for the quality, but if it is a first time, I would recommend lunch time to genuinely experience the food and a calmer environment.",

Heard good things about meat & potatoes from several friends, so I thought to give it a try this trip to Pgh.  I came as a walk in and didn't have reservations (it was a tuesday night) so I was offered to order at the bar, full menu.  I had bone marrow, a good portion served and with the toppings it was excellent.   Pot roast was the best I've had in my life.  I believe it was a chuckroast with carrots, other vegetables and whipped potatoes with a very savory sauce - I finished every last bite (which is rare, usually taking home a doggie bag.)  I have no idea what was in it, but the flavoring was amazingly tasty.  The pot roast was tender and no difficulty eating.  I finished my meal with the chocolat pot au creme, a mousse like pudding, which personally I thought was a nice finish after a bit of a heavy meal.  I had a cup of coffee to end my meal, espresso was not on the menu.    I will be back, to try the mushroom risotto, pork chops and the meat & potatoes for two - heard rave reviews about the latter.",

    "text": "I was pretty sure that no place in the 'Burgh would supplant Park Bruges as my favorite brunch spot, but Meat & Potatoes makes it close.  I love the layout of the restaurant - outdoor seating, but indoors the center of the room is a large bar, with the tables in the periphery.  To top it off, the chairs have high backs, and are the most comfortably dining chairs I've sat in.  That sounds stupid, but it was enough for me to notice.  The food was fantastic.  There is a nice touch to start, in that they bring an oversized, fresh, blueberry muffin.   This muffin has the perfect, sugary and crunchy top.  And definitely share the short ribs hash for the table.  We ordered nearly ever brunch entree, and everyone was happy: Pub Burger, Fried Chicken and Cheddar Jalapeno Waffles, a BPBLT (a gourmet BLT with pastrami belly).  The portions are quite sizeable, so bring your appetite.  Service was equally great.  I always enjoy it when the staff are also foodies, and get excited about the menu items, have actually tried the menu and drinks, and offer educated recommendations.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back for a dinner service.",

    "text": "Having been to Meat & Potatoes countless times, I recently revisited for the first time in over a year and was delighted to see that it hasn't missed a beat, despite the fact that the ownership has continued to add more hip restaurants/bars to its repertoire. The cocktails are still awesome. There's still an interesting beer list, a few of which are draft, but most of which is entirely in cans. The menu continues to change every so often and offer some great items including the mussels, which seem to have become a mainstay there, a mushroom risotto (awesome though a bit heavy on the parsley) and a pickled chicken sandwich with bread + butter pickles, garlic mayo and iceberg lettuce, which was just freakin' delicious! On an earlier occasion a while back, I had a beef sandwich that was a daily special and was about the best beef sandwich that I've ever had! While I find the atmosphere to be too modern and contrived to be called a gastropub as they call themselves, it's fun and lively. It has a speakeasy feel to it, though it's very open and visible, so it's more like a speakeasy that came out of the closet. The service was decent. Bonus points for the kitchen being open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.",

    "text": "Note: By ALL means, make a reservation. A few months ago, we were turned away because we didn't have one.    It was a harrowing journey from Kay's Beaver Falls lovenest to Downtown Pittsburgh for my belated birthday date with culinary destiny: Meat & Potatoes. A fender bender on Route 60 did not deter us nor did the frigid temperatures. I was meant to come here, yesterday, not moons before, and we made it just in time. A phone call Kay made en route to M&P explaining that we might be late was unnecessary even though they promised to hold our table for another 30 minutes. They also knew we were meant to dine here.  Emily, our ornately tattooed server who went up, away, and beyond her call of duty to make this a gastronomic night of nights, knew we were meant to come here against all adversity. The glitter in her bespectacled eyes and her pixieish demeanor were simultaneously homey, reassuring ('don't worry, ya made it! i promise it'll rule!'), and magically stirring, as if she was a riot grrl/food fairy/carnival barker leading us onto a rollercoaster of protein, starch, and housemade opulence. The restaurant was dark like a theater, a theater of madness, wonder...  I believe, she wanted to test us, test...me. She saw me coming, months ago, I swear...in a crystal ball...  A ternion of Devils On Horseback charged towards us with flag-like skewers jutting from their armadillo backs. Honeyed, bacon-wrapped, armored like hellborne beetles, full of chorizo sausage, manchego cheese, and topped with peppers, onions, and a red sauce reminiscent of ketchup that I cannot recall the name of, I finished off two, Kay dispatched one.  After quickly shellacking our first appetizer, I inspected my surroundings. Dish rags were napkins. Mason jars held food, candles. Water was poured from glass milk bottles. A large bar in the center of the room came off as a carousel for cackling, well-to-do adults who wanted very much to be seen. In what was a demonic, Dickensian Coney Island for carnivores and time-travelers, Kay and I just tried to survive in it.  The second appetizer came in the form of Pate, as M&P calls it. A duck liver mucilage is topped off with a sauternes jam in a sealed jar and served with toasted, grainy bread and a spreading knife. A rare treat, we rationed it, swaying with each gloriously silken, subtly sweet, crunchy bite.   Knowing that they must grind their own beef, I was compelled to try the Pub Burger, or was it compelled to try...me? The imperious fried egg was the first thing I saw followed by the flaky, buttery bun and the horseradish cheddar flap. The trembling, fat pastrami pork belly slab became noticeable only after the initial chomp. A \"special sauce\" lurked...somewhere within. Magnificently frizzled and exotically seasoned \"fried taters\" sat off to the side in a steaming heap. These are also offered as a \"snack\" with truffle mayonnaise, but when I asked to have the truffle mayonnaise, Emily gladly obliged for an upcharge. The beef, egg, cheese, and pastrami all colluded to create a creamy-meets-meaty alchemy for my mouth, and I savored it in lieu of attacking it. This was more than a burger; this was a game of chess, the crowning french fries and the exquisite truffle mayo acting as a respite between moves unti...checkmate!   Kay had a pot full of mussels that were likely the greatest and freshest of all the mussels ever noshed on. Arriving at an ideal consistency between gummy, gamey, and tender, the mussels soaked in a intoxicatingly beery brine that begged to be absorbed by our bread and were chaperoned by plump cubes of a bacon packed with flavors that were at once earthy and unearthly. Clearly, this was not bacon from a supermarket cooler.   We almost ordered dessert. That was until Kay said with a playful look in her eye, \"You know you want that marrow. Order it. It's your night.\" Emily approved, laughing as she headed back to the kitchen as if aloft on butterfly wings, likely saying in her head, \"Man, these groovy folks GET it!\"   Out came three bones colossal enough to have come from wyverns along with cups of gremolata, pearl onions, capers, sea salt, and more bread. With this dish, we danced on the edge of de trop, the filthy rich jellied lard nearly overwhelming us. It has been called \"God's Butter.\" After last night, I shall call it \"Satan's Tallow.\"   Lastly, dessert arrived in a dyad of mason jars. One was Red Velvet Cake, complete with a lone candle to commemorate my birthday. The other was a chocolate mousse so iniquitous, so profoundly profane in its sugariness, I coveted it, longing to snatch it from Kay's hands. Not even a cap of whipped cream was enough to cut its carnal cocoa essence. The Red Velvet held its own, however, its batter bright red and moist, its cream cheese icing adding angelic vim in an attempt to offer salvation from tawny, aerated damnation. Thus ended our ride and trial. It did not kill us. We are now stronger.",

    "text": "Disappointed.  I was so excited to finally try Meat & Potatoes and it failed to live up to what I hoped it would be.  First off the ambiance was fantastic, I  loved the decor and the feel of the restaurant.  I thought it was modern and inviting.  My table of 4 got a bad break to begin with being seated right by the patio door.  Normally I don't think this would've been a huge issue, but it was almost 100 degrees outside.  The door was constantly being open and shut and it really made the two of us closest to the door extremely hot (how did people eat outside!).    We started with some cocktails, and they were all fantastic.  The Corpse Reviver was the standout of the group and I recommend it highly.  After perusing the menu for a bit, myself and someone at our table decided to split the Meat & Potatoes for 2.  It is a 34 oz Ribeye, Steak Fries and Bone Marrow.  Doing the math we figured that this would be plenty of food for two people, thus we only got the Grilled Bread with Goat Butter and Jam to start, it was very good and the jam was fantastic.    We were very wrong when we thought it would be plenty of food for two people, especially two men.  It might have been a 34 oz ribeye if they count the 2 foot bone sticking out of the ribeye because it definitely wasn't enough for two people.  We ordered our ribeye medium and it came out really rare, we are talking barely warm in the middle rare.  I can usually understand not getting the steak completely correct, but I've almost never been served a piece of meat as off as this one was.  Instead of cooking us a new one, they cooked the pieces we had already cut off and what was left on the bone and brought it back out.  I understand this because it was an expensive piece of meat I'm assuming, but still was a little off putting.  The fries and bone marrow were nothing special in my mind.  Neither one was especially flavorful or memorable.    We then skipped desert because of the heat radiating from the constant open doorway next to us and called it a night.   Maybe I'll give Meat & Potatoes another chance, but it's definitely not somewhere I'll be running back to.  UPDATE:  After going back a couple more times and eating lunch there I'm upping my review to 4 stars.  Their lunch menu is fantastic, and I would recommend it highly.",

    "text": "I know that I'm late to the party on this one, but I've been trying to be pescatarian for the past half year, so it's been a bit tough to come here. That being said, we break \"fast\" every now and then, and Meat and Potatoes is a great way to get your meat on. The name is actually quite fitting, because if you want veggies at all, this is not where you're going to find that - I think about 15% of their menu might include vegetables.  The pate is phenomenal, as is the bone marrow appetizer. You'll feel full just from eating that, because it is so rich. But totally worth it. I also had duck here and it was great too. Also - try the red velvet dessert. It comes in a jar, which is really fitting because you won't be able to finish it and then you can just take it home in your purse. So, evidently I have broken \"fast\" a few times. But, why am I writing only now?  Because I discovered Meat and Potatoes brunch - which is on both Saturday AND Sunday. Hear that Pittsburgh? Saturday AND Sunday. Some of you would do well to note that many of us aren't limited to brunch on Sundays!  Anyway, I've been having a fried chicken craving for the past month or so (if you've been a dedicated meat eater for most of your life, and then go pescatarian, it catches up with you sometimes) and someone told me that Meat and Potatoes does down-to-earth goodness fried chicken and waffles. Let me tell you about the last time I had chicken and waffles. It was at midnight at the Waffle Shop in East Liberty, and the fried chicken was so bad, I left it, and the waffles tasted like cardboard. But that's another story... Needless to say, this fried chicken and waffles was PHENOMENAL. The fried chicken is perfectly breaded and cooked (you can tell them if you just want dark or light meat) and the waffle is made out of this wonderful cheese-jalapeno batter that is only the slightest bit spicy. Which comes with syrup cooked with bacon.   Did you just fall over? That must be my puddle of drool you just slipped on. Sorry.",

It was a nice night in Pittsburgh, so we decided to dine outside on the patio, but the inside looked pretty cool as well.  There looked to be a room off the main area for a group dinner party.  The food was on point.  We started off with fries and an order of \"Devils on Horseback\".  I can't really give a great explanation of what the latter is, but it involves bacon-wrapped dates, cheese, and I believe olives.  It made me think \"high-end stoner food\".  I hope that helps.   For entree, my wife got the papparedelle bolognese and I got the special, which was a flank steak with a fried egg, bearnaise sauce and a short rib hash.  My dish was delicious.... a bit on the salty side, but very good.  The pasta was very good as well.  We stuck with wine for our dinner, but the drink menu had a wide variety of cocktails.  If that's your thing, I'm sure you'll find something worth trying.  The service was just okay.  I think our waitress was a bad shift or two away from throwing her apron away.... or maybe she just had a really long night.     Recommend!",

    "text": "Made a reservation at 6:30 on a Thursday night. Very glad we did because as we were checking in with the hostess, she was turning away several people. (The next opening, I overheard, was at 9:30). Lesson learned. Always make a reservation.   We were seated at a very small table along the wall and ordered apertifs. As an appetizer, boy and I chose the artesian cheese board with bread and rhubarb jam. All the cheeses (one cow, one sheep, and one goat) were very tasty especially when paired with the jam and walnuts. Note, this appetizer was rather small so expect it to only feed two.   I ordered the duck breast and boy chose the pappardelle pasta. I was informed that the duck was usually served medium-rare, which I thought a bit dodgy for a poultry item. I asked them to prepare it medium. The duck was very flavorful, and served with a few sauerkraut pierogies and chimicurri sauce. Yum! Boy's pasta was also good. The bolognese/pork shoulder sauce was very savory and rich. I usually enjoy cheese on my pasta, but I guarantee you will NOT need it with this dish.   To finish, we shared a peanut butter parfait. It was so rich, we couldn't finish it!   I saw so many other menu items I would like to try (not to mention the mussels), so we will be returning!   The food is five-star. I docked Meat and Potatoes one because the service tends to be a bit slow and the atmosphere is LOUD. I wish I could give it an extra half star because the bartenders dress like they walked off the set of Newsies. And who doesn't love Newsies?",

    "text": "We chose this venue for the last night of our Pittsburgh mini-vacation.  I began with the house's barrel aged Manhattan cocktail. Smooth, and not too sweet. My partner had her usual Riesling.  We shared the marrow bones, which at $18 are priced and portioned for two. This may have been the single best presentation of this dish I have encountered - and I've been eating them since I had them at St. John in London back in 2002 when this was a new idea. Three large bones, packed with marrow. Condiments were gros sel, pickled onion, capers, and a gremolata. I tried all four condiments - the salt worked best. The charred toasts were also excellent and moist with oil. We demanded more toasts to process the luscious masses of marrow.  For a main course I selected the lamb cassoulet. If I remember the menu correctly, this comprised lamb neck (Jamison farm?), lamb sausage and a sort of \"streusel\" of lamb bacon. The dish arrived as a sort of timbale of meat atop a ragout of beans, topped with pea greens. It was attractive if not the typical presentation. No confit, no duck or goose. The lamb was tender, the cut more like half of a  braised lamb shank than the usual slice of neck. The beans had the proper texture. The sausage sort of broke down. Overall I enjoyed the dish, but descriptions fail me  it's sort of a cross between a braised lamb shank and a cassoulet.   I washed it down with Terrazas Cabernet from Argentina, a great buy.  My partner plumped for the roasted Pennsylvania chicken which was firing on all cylinders. Despite it being tender young chicken there was a deep flavor, nice round dumplings, bacon fat. The sauerkraut and Brussels sprouts sort of disappeared into the juices.  Collard greens, a side order were light, spicy and sweet - not the usual taste of turkey neck or pork bones.  No room for dessert after the marrow and meats.  Good service and good value.",

They have a back room that has additional seating that we were placed on. Not impressed that they first seated is on the table closest to the door that the waiter would have to pass close by every time and though there were plenty of other free tables we had to ask to be moved. Back room is also smoky from the kitchen.  As a vegetarian I had the grilled bread (delicious with yummy butter with sea salt) and the Brussel sprouts (shredded to unrecognizable and very salty).  Overall not a very memorable dinner for the price. Will not be returning.",

In the meantime nephew made reservations for play 'The Toxic Avenger' for 7:30PM. During the course of the day we passed Meat & Potatoes & stopped in to see if could be bumped to an earlier seating - snagged a table for 5 for 9:30PM - play 7:30 - 9:30PM next door!  Finally decided on dinner: Appetizer - Fried Pickle, Fried Pigs Ears, Poutine, Caesars salad Entree - Thia Mussels in spicy coconut broth, Lamb Neck Cassoulet, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Roasted Chicken & special Chicken and Dumplings + dessert  Let me say this - This place is a well honed lean, mean working machine. The service was fast & courteous. The wait staff knew their products. When the food arrived the servers new exactly who was getting what. The same happened with our after dinner drinks - no questions who's drink is...   Now to the food we go: Fried Pickle - delish, with a slight kick, Fried Pigs Ears - yum, crunchy, Poutine - oh my my, love, love poutine ever since I was introduced to it some decades ago in Canada & this was deeeeelish also.  Mussels - extra spicy as requested, yum finger lick'in good (wrong product). They were absolutely delicious. The cassoulet, fall of the bone. Risotto - yum, both chicken dishes - finger lick'in good.",

    "text": "House - Had a wonderful dinner Monday, January 2, 2017, having 8:00 p.m. reservations. Pittsburgh was quiet after the New Year celebrations and so was Meat and Potatoes - several open tables and places at the bar, which sits in the center of the large dining room. The room is circled by half booths in velvet with heavy 2-person white marble top tables that were nice and sturdy. I have mobility issues and there were no steps to get into the restaurant and our table was near the entrance so I had a very easy time getting to the table. The cushioned booth side I was sitting on was quite low and I was afraid I'd have trouble getting up as my leg strength is the problem, but I was able to make it up fine. There was a large still water bottle with a bale top stopper that the hostess poured our water out of. The glasses are plain and heavily weighted. The water was not chilled, which I would have preferred.  Cocktails & Appetizers - Our server was Crystal, a wonderfully cheerful and polite young lady, who happily shared her best information and advice on drink and food choices. I had a Mexican Honey Bee which was strong but good, and my husband had a Dark and Stormy, which was quite too strong for me. We ordered fried pickles with spicy ranch and an order of the poutine. We did not care for the fried pickles appetizer and did not eat more than a bite - the pickles were not like dill flavored. They were very strong and overpowered the ranch and breading. The poutine was a new dish for both of us and it was absolutely delicious with a lovely gravy with melted cheese curds and scallions that really made the flavor pop.  Salad - I ordered the Cobb salad and it was a very large oval plate with iceburg carpaccio / bacon lardons / tomatoes / maytag blue cheese / egg / avocado ranch dressing. The carpaccio is only indicative of the fact that the iceburg is sliced into thin flat rounds. Probably won't be able to tell this since it's piled up with condiments. This was a lovely salad with delicious bacon lardons that I wish were more plentiful, but the blue cheese and avocado ranch dressing simply clashed in a very distasteful way. I'd definitely get this salad again but just leave off the ranch and ask for blue cheese only. I can recommend this salad based on that stipulation.  Entrees - After consulting with our server Crystal about the specials, I decided to go with my original idea of the Wagyu Flat Iron - smoked fingerling potatoes / celery root / maitaki / soubise / pecorino compound butter - and after reading another Yelp review, I asked to substitute Confit potatoes instead of the fingerling potatoes, but Crystal said it would not be possible based on how the dish is put together (everything coming combined underneath the steak). The steak was absolutely the most delicious steak I have had in YEARS. It reminds me of the grass-fed beef from my childhood. It was so worth the $38. I ended up just getting a side order of the confit potatoes and they were fantastic - crunchy on the outside while fluffy, soft and delicious on the inside. My husband got the Pappardelle - bolognese sauce / pancetta / pork shoulder / garlic bread - this was a delicious dish as well and very economical at just $18. The bolognese was almost like stew meat and very plentiful in the dish  with fewer but very large flat noodles. The garlic bread would have been much better had it been grilled. It was quite chewy but definitely not a deal breaker. My husband was very happy with this dish and would definitely order it again. One last note about the evening's specials, Crystal was very nice to guide me about the extremely small portion of Octopus (3 oz) special available, which definitely helped me greatly in my entree decision making.    Desserts - My husband ordered the apple cheesecake which was in a jar with crumble topping and he said it was delicious and not overly sweet, which was very pleasing to him and he would order it again. I ordered the Pot de Creme chocolate with whipped cream topping and caramel popcorn topping which was absolutely delicious together.  The bill came to just under $150 and we ended up taking virtually all the dishes home with the exception of the fried pickles, which Crystal had taken off our bill. This was a very nice gesture and was not expected at all as there was nothing wrong with the dish except just the taste to us was not pleasant. This was one of the best dinners we've had in quite a while and it just makes me want to return as soon as my wallet rebounds.  Decor/Environment - Five Stars Food - Five Stars Service - Five Stars  We hope your experience is as pleasant as ours was. Enjoy!",

Definitely reserve a table in advance. When my husband and I went, we were lucky to find an open table as walk-ins, possibly because it was a weeknight. We ordered the Devils on horseback, Thai curry mussels (with fries) and the pork belly tacos. Omg the flavors here are so incredibly bold, but not overpowering in any way. The reason for my reduction of one star you ask? I got sick afterwards. I can't exactly pinpoint this meal as the culprit, but I'm almost certain the mussels were it. Despite getting a little sick, I would definitely come back to try something different next time. The food here is just that worth it.",

    "text": "Meat & Potatoes is practically legendary in Pittsburgh.  This restaurant is within the Cultural Trust building that contains a parking garage, the backstage bar, and the Cabaret Theater.  It is usually crowded so definitely make a reservation if possible.  My friend and I came here as a celebration, and we ordered quite a bit of food.  We started with the Tartare ($16) and Short Rib Flatbread ($12).  We needed some instructions with the Tartare because we had no idea how to eat it.  We ended up ordering pita to it with it, but the server could have done a bit more explaining when asked.  The flatbread, however, was unique and delicious.  It had the rib meat, bleu cheese, and a sweetness to it.  For dinner, I ordered the Parpadelle ($18), which was FANTASTIC.  I eat very little meat in general, but the meat here is flawless.  It is so perfectly tender and amazing.  The pasta and sauce were delicious as well.  Absolutely recommend.  My friend ordered the duck breast ($18), which was also delicious!  I know most people come here and get the giant cow thing, but I am not into meat enough to order that.   We finished off our meal with some kind of Creme Brule dessert thing.  It was served in a mason jar and also had hints of chocolate.  It was just ok and really lacked any distinct flavor.  We did not even eat half of the dessert between two of us.  So why is this place not perfect?  The lovely ambiance is ruined by tables that are too close together.  You can barely move and forget having much of a conversation with anyone you are out to dinner with.  The worst part is that you are so close that the people next to you will try to jump into your conversation.  It's basically family style seating, which is so not my scene.  While the food is fantastic, I am unlikely to return unless I want to sit alone at the bar.",

    "text": "M&P's newer sister restaurant, Butcher & Rye, had a wait so we walked right over and got seated after a really short wait. No worries, I enjoy original restaurants to get an idea of what this Pittsburg restaurant family has to offer.  I would give this restaurant a 3.8 if it were possible.   My dining partner isn't as adventurous of a diner as I am so I didn't order the fried chicken liver or the fried pig ears that I really wanted. We settled on the buffalo mac and cheese instead. Great creamy gooey texture but holy cow was it salty!  3.5.   I ordered the lamb shank with cous cous which was well made and tasty. No gamey flavor and the cous cous was cooked well. A solid 4.0.   My partner had the parpadelle bolognese which I had more than a few bites of. The sauce was hearty and delicious, there might have been a little too much meat in the sauce which I know I would've struggled with if I had ordered that dish but to each his own.  My partner loved the al dente texture of the pasta but to me, the texture seemed less like al dente but more like perhaps too much flour in the dough?  Something was off but I prefer this to overdone pasta. 3.5-4.0.   We tried two cocktails, can't recall the names of them but I wouldn't waste any money on cocktails there again. Perhaps I'm spoiled since I've had some really superior cocktails back home in NYC and internationally but the flavors just didn't mesh and they were not easy to drink.   The staff were friendly and unpretentious and decor was comfortable and inviting. Price wise, I'd say they were on point. Overall, M&P would be a place I'd visit again and try different dishes if I found myself in the neighborhood and hungry but I didn't like it as much as I had hoped.",

The Kobe Corndog was pretty good on the inside, with a very pinkish hotdog meat. The outer breading was rather dry and too thick. On top was sprinkled a few leaves of cilantro, very thin radish slices, and a light wasabi-based sauce - these additions didn't really add to the corndog. The ketchup on the side was unnecessary.  The wagyu iron flat, the beef was a good texture, easy to chew and eat. It was a nice pink color in the center and browned on the outside. It was also too salty. I liked the sweet and slight tartness of the picked red onions. The yucca fries were rather dehydrated but ok. The plantain chips were too hard and dry.  Lively gastropub, there is a large square bar area in the center of the room, wood tables and comfy plush chairs around the room's peripheral, . Dim lighting with filament light bulbs, upbeat music playing overhead, and plenty of chatter. Seems hip and happening.  The service was good, the waitress was attentive and considerate.",

We came on time for our reservation but for some reason they still made us wait 15 minutes to be seated. As when we walked in there were several tables empty, so I'm not sure why we even had to wait, especially when we made the reservation a week in advance.  I came with a group of 5 and we wanted to order finger food that we could share. We ordered mostly the snacks and flatbreads.   Fried pickles - just as it sounds, pickles with a layer of fried batter Buttermilk Fried chicken livers - didn't like this as much, I guess I'm not a big liver fan Fried Taters w/ Mayo - tastes like regular cripsy, thin french fries The Salty Pig flatbread - very very salty, couldn't taste anything but very salty cured meats, we didn't like this one as much Mushroom Flatbread - this one was great! more delicate than the Salty Pig, you can really taste the mushrooms Thai Mussels - loved the Thai mussels, mussels were fresh  Overall, I was a little bit disappointed by the food but it's probably our fault for ordering the fried foods, which is really nothing special. I wish we ordered the bone marrow or something from the main entrees, which is probably what Meat and Potatoes is better known for. I would come back here again to try more than their bar-type foods.  The servers were friendly though. I wish they recommended items to us, but they were nice enough to cut our flatbread for us when we asked them to.",

The Bloody Mary bar was everything a self-proclaimed Bloody Mary aficionado could have ever dreamed of; house infused vodkas, homemade smooth tomato juice, 20 hot sauces, meats, cheeses, shrimp, bacon, olives, pickles, horseradish. It was incredible. The whimsical menu had some wonderful options. I wanted to try one of everything. I had chicken and waffles which was pretty amazing. Others had pancakes and stuffed French toast which were big hits. We had an excellent time as fabulous food at Meat and Potatoes.",

Then a party of 8 comes in stating that they had an 8:30 reservation.  There was a debate about whether or not they had a confirmed reservation.

It also seems like they are trying a little too hard to be cool and trendy.  I am sure being located in the cultural district that is expected, but it feels forced and over done.

We started with cocktails and crispy pork ears served with quick pickles. The ears were nice and crunchy - more like crispy bacon than some other places I've tried them. We also had the poutine which much like American poutine in general does hold up to its Canadian counterpart. But if you haven't had it in Canada, this one was okay. My one compliant is the cheese curds - there isn't enough and their consistency is such that they don't really melt. I had the buffalo two ways - buffalo steak served with buffalo sweet breads. The steak was yummy and fairly light. I usually like sweet breads, but these were maybe too big because they seemed a little too glandular for me to stomach. Plus I wasn't a fan of the buffalo sauce. If you like buffalo wings, you might enjoy this spin. We also had the bone in steak served with twice baked potatoes. It was a nice steak and a good representation for a restaurant of the same name.",

Lots of flavor and marbling (my favorite part of a ribeye). Mushroom ragu on top was like icing on a cake. Delicious! The steak fries were about normal when it comes to steak fries, but dipped in the black truffle mayo (worth it for an extra $1 to have it on the side), they were almost up there with being as delicious as the steak (sort of kidding, but really good dipped in the mayo)!!  The bone marrow gratin was a first time try for me! It was actually fairly good, very fatty flavor, and I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it, but I am glad I tried it (plus it came with the entree).  Artisanal cheese board as an appetizer was yummy also. 3 different cheese, and some fruits, and the preserve was lovely!! It comes with some bread too.  I wish we had saved room for dessert - maybe next time.  The tables are a bit tiny.",

The more I think about the meal the more I realize that I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I thought. The place itself was really nice but parking was a bit tough downtown at night. The atmosphere was definitely something different but it was quite crowded and noisy.  I actually loved the \"snacks\" that they had, we ordered buttermilk fried chicken livers and fried brussels. The livers were perfectly soft and the dip that it came with was perfect.  The brussels also came with a dip that I was pretty happy with as well.    For the main course we ordered a lamb burger and a korean reuben.  I thought  that the fusion was a creative idea but the execution was nothing spectacular.  The burgers also came with a bowl of fries and as a huge french fry fan I was delighted.  I liked the fries better than the reuben but my boyfriend didn't have a taste for them because they were a bit on the salty side.  They definitely didn't skimp on the portions like a lot of other pricier restaurants do which was a huge plus for me because I was working up an appetite.  They didn't have a menu for desserts but the waitress listed them off to us and none of them sounded particularly appetizing. As we were leaving I caught someone ordering a bone marrow and that looked like it was definitely worth trying!   TLDR: Meh, I'd go again but not anytime soon.",

When we go here before a concert, they always ask what time the concert is and make sure your food comes out at a timely manner. I'm in need of a concert to go to in Pittsburgh so I can come back here!",

    "text": "A 5 Star brunch review!  Here we go!  Background: Long time fan of M&P - In fact, its my favorite High End Gastropub eatery that is in PGH! A tall feat considering all of the mouth watering options around town! This amazing trip was a surprise from my friends who had set this up in part for me before I leave town. Considering I had just been at a wedding the night before, It was probably one of the few things that got me up and ready to go when I was told in the morning!  Seating: We had a reservation for noon and I was pleased to find out that we were placed in the private room that is immediately to your left when you enter the bar/dining room.   Menu: The Brunch menu is not expansive but it doesn't have to be like that anyway. Everything on the menu is done to a high level and you can tell when all the food comes out.   Dish: I went with the Bi Bim Bap: (skirt steak / black fried rice / pickled cucumbers / carrots / korean hot sauce / sunny side up egg) and it was Amazing! The flavors paired well and it was a good amount of food.   LIBATIONS: I started with some coffee that was good, not great. No worries though since my mimosa was on point! Smooth and delicious! Lastly, I got the Jefferson's Quill: (bulleit bourbon / strawberry hibiscus / lemon / mint / bitters) which was also very good. I tried several Bloody Mary's which all had great toppings (grape leaves, stuffed mini peppers, dill brussel sprouts) and different juices and infused vodkas!!!    Service: Our waiter was very good. He gave recommendations, was attentive, brought our food and drinks out on time. All in all, he did a good job with a large group.   Check out brunch here at least once! I'll be back for sure!!!",

    "text": "I had not been to M&P since shortly after it first opened so when I chose a random Friday night I knew my bf would be in town, I booked a 9:30 reservation for the two of us. Parking is so convenient due to the Theater Square garage being in the same building. I forget the cost, but I do remember it was quite reasonable. We arrived a little early and our table wasn't ready yet so we sat on one of the couches in the lobby for a few minutes until we were taken back. The tables when you first walk in are a very tight squeeze, however, we were seated on the opposite side of the dining room, and I did not find the tables to be too tight together. We were not privy to our table neighbors conversations so there was a decent amount of space between each table.   Our server was very efficient and attentive without being intrusive. She quickly got us water and let us peruse the drink menu a bit further. My bf decided not to have a drink, which meant I had to have two-one for him AND one for me ;) The drinks were expertly made-I had a bourbon drink and a whiskey drink. They were very tasty and very strong, but I wasn't the one driving so bring it on! We started out with the Lobster mac and cheese. It was so creamy and the doritos crust really added a unique touch to the dish. There were several chunks of lobster mixed uniformly throughout. This was easily the best lobster mac I have had in quite some time, possibly ever! I totally wish I didn't have to share because I could have downed that dish in a few scoops just by myself, it was that good! The portion was a nice size as well, perfect for two. My boyfriend had the duck which was cooked PERFECTLY to a medium rare. It was melt in your mouth juicy, and I will absolutely order that dish on my next visit! I went with the short rib flatbread after reading rave reviews on that dish on Yelp. I was impressed-the bleu cheese was not overpowering and the short rib was so very tender and juicy. I liked the arugula on top as well-VERY tasty! I wanted to save room for dessert so I left one small piece behind.  I was disappointed they ran out of the pot de creme and the chocolate smores dessert, however, they had a red velvet cookie cake that was TO DIE for! I'm not even a red velvet fan and I'd totally order this again, although I am hoping next time they don't run out of the chocolate pot de creme. This was a stellar dining experience, from service to food to ambience. I will ABSOLUTELY return (and hopefully it's for brunch!)",

What should have been a pleasant evening immediately became one of disrespect & ignorance. When I walked in with my daughter and her friends to get them a table I asked the hostess for a table for them & a table for myself and my husband. I was immediately told,\" we don't split parties\" and the hostess made a face of disgust at me. I then, calmly, stated to her that there would be separate checks and that she should seat our two different parties as requested. She & the young man then gave me the ugliest faces in front of my daughter and her friends. When I asked to speak to the manager he came out and it was apparent that he wanted to defend his host staff more than he wanted to fix the situation with the poor customer service. Needless to say we didn't stay, and we won't darken their doorstep ever again. We value ourselves, but obviously they didn't feel the same. When did it become okay to treat customers with such blatant displays of ignorance?",

    "text": "After hearing rave reviews and watching the Food Network special on this restaurant, my parents and I were looking forward to dining here.  The first time we stopped by, we learned that it is so busy most days that you need a reservation.  We promptly booked a reservation for the following week.  The first sign that the service is less than adequate was that I received a text message reminder that my reservation was for 15 minutes later than what I booked and it included an extra person.  I called, and although the hostess was apologetic, they were unable to change the time to what I originally booked.    I am gluten-intolerant.  Dining out at any restaurant is a risk that I assume, but I do expect a high quality restaurant to try to get it right.  After informing the waitress of my food sensitivities, I ordered the tartare.  It arrived on top of a piece of bread.  The waitress was apologetic, but I didn't have much confidence in the food service after that.  Also, what kind of a restaurant serves tartare on top of bread???  That's a great way to ruin a beautiful delicacy, ability to eat bread aside.    For the main meal, my mother and I ordered the meat and potatoes for two.  It was a novelty and we were both pleased with the presentation and the taste of the meal.  We had a lot of leftovers, and that brings me to another very disappointing experience.  We scraped all of the meat off the bone prior to having the waitress take it back to box it up.  When we opened the box the next day, we discovered that they only gave us half of the meat.  This is unacceptable for what we paid for the meal and the amount of meat that was leftover.  We were not otherwise impressed with the service, as it was difficult to get the attention of the waitress throughout the meal.         The atmosphere was not quite what we were expecting.  We were expecting more of a higher quality, upscale dining experience, but the music was too loud for conversation.  The decor was unique, although the chairs in the waiting area desperately need to be restored.    Overall, I don't feel that the meal was worth the money that we spent.  If you have food sensitivities, beware!",

We were directed to the bar and were delighted to see that two seats had just opened up.   We sat down, were greeted and given water and menus.   That was it.   Ten minutes later we got up and left because no one cared to take out drink order or answer questions about the menu.   It was busy, yes. But that is no excuse for rudeness. If you can't handle the crowds, pull back a bit on your profit motive and hire more wait staff or Leo something else.   We were very disappointed because of all the good reviews we saw on yelp. Maybe those reviews only pertained to table service.",

    "text": "I'm pretty in love with this place.  Not a fan of the wait or the never-anything-available-at-the-time-I-want reservation system, but the food speaks for itself.      I have been to the bar once or twice and come for brunch, but most recently it was dinner.  Here's what we had:   - The 34 ounce ribeye.  So I didn't actually order this, but I was sitting at the bar waiting for my friends and the people got one.  Served on a big wooden cutting board, it screams \"caveman\" with a big bone sticking up off the side.  It was huge and meaty and looked divine.   My friend arrived and we were discussing what to order when I said \"I'd love to order that steak, but a couple of us would have to share it.\"  The folks next to us *(perfect strangers) said \"it's amazing - don't order it - have some of ours and then try something else from the menu\".  They then proceeded to hack off a 6 ounce hunk and put it on my little bread plate with some mushrooms and a potato wedge (people are just awesome sometimes).   And they were right - it was amazing.  Tender and well-seasoned - cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be coming back for it with the boyfriend.     - The curry mussels.  Having had kind of an impromptu meal at the bar, I decided on the mussels as my entree at the table.  The broth was the best mussel broth I have ever had.  I actually packed up the leftover broth in a to-go container and plan to pour it on some chicken and rice this evening for dinner.  The mussel portion was large and you can get some fries or bread on the side if you want round out the meal.      - The pot de creme.  I'm not a huge dessert person, but I was told I HAD to order this.  This was rich and chocolaty without being super heavy or overly sweet.  The perfect end to my meal and definitely a dessert I would recommend.    I also sampled the pot roast and some sort of lemon pie (in a mason jar) that were really great.   Everyone loved every bite and every cocktail (did I mention that they have all kinds of handmade goodies in that department?)   Brunch is just as amazing as dinner - I'll definitely be back.",

The place was packed to capacity on a Thursday afternoon around 1PM. There was one bartender on duty who was also acting as our server. While cordial enough, she was obviously overwhelmed. After a while she took our orders, and we sat at the bar being bumped up against by fellow patrons and wait staff. After waiting almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a salad, we ran out of time and asked the bartender to make our order to go. She assured us twice that it would be right out. Another 10 minutes later and the order finally came out. Overall the food was nothing to rave about, and certainly not worth having to wait 40 minutes for. No utensils were included and a side was missing. We certainly didn't get what all the hype was about.",

So we were shown to our table and my fingers were crossed that our server would be amazing!  We looked over our brunch menu noticed that it was a little different the the one we saw online, but ok.  K.C came over to our table and BAM we were off and running! She is truly an amazing server... Told us all about the specials and took our drink order, great personality and very tentative to our needs! She made great suggestions for food ideas and we ordered....  Food was fantastic and all 6 of us were very happy... I had the short rib hash and It was so yummy.... So I give them 5 stars and will be back to see K.C please ask for her when you make the reservation, you won't be disappointed !",

The hostess did go the extra mile to get us at a full-sized table when asked to be moved - we were initially at a cocktail table much to our dismay.  Two large people at a small round table isn't very comfortable. We did get attitude from our server when we asked to be moved to a larger table.  But, again, the food more than made up for the bad attitude from the server.  My husband and I went there on Friday, February 13th for an anniversary dinner.  The wild mushroom risotto was amazing!  We both had the flat iron steak and it was cooked to perfection.  The charred carrot salad that the meat was served with was phenomenal.  For dessert, we had a malted chocolate potted cream that was pretty much heaven.  If you go, ask for a full-sized table when you make your reservations or you might find yourself at a small cocktail table.  Reservations are an absolute must - you won't get a table on a Friday night without one.",

The bone marrow is fun and well made, the goat-butter and jam appetizer is a wonderful combination of flavor, the mac-and-cheese is extremely good, and the spicy stuffed dates were so good I've tried replicating them at home.

Low key vibe and awesome decor. The food is amazing. I almost always go for the mussels, which can't be beat. But we've also shared a lot of the apps and been impressed. Backroom is great for larger groups or work related entertaining as well. Fun place to go but be sure to make a reservation well in advance!",

Had some excellent cocktails, I figured hey I don't drink wild drinks that often so I asked the bartender to make me something with bourbon. Whatever he made me was incredible, I think he told me it was called pushing up daisies or something along those lines.   Once we were seated, definitely need reservations here, which we had. We had some risotto as an appetizer. This actually should have been my main course. It was perfectly cooked and so creamy owww! Then next was a steak and rib entree, which I ordered medium-rare, once again on point and so delicious. The special lady ordered the pot pie, And I have to admit it was the best pot pie I have ever had and to top it off it was so large I ended up eating for another 2 days afterwords.   The only thing that was sort of stupid was that I got charged $0.75 for a to go jar for my desert? What gives ?! I just spent over $100 not including tip and your going to pull a  maneuver like that. I mean what's $0.75 on top of my $40 bar tab and $75 dinner bill. It's just the point of it all. I still love this place anyway. The people and service are great and the food kicks butt too!",

The place has a very cool urban/gastropub vibe with lots of interesting decor. For appetizers, we split the Devils on Horseback  (trust me. Order them.), fried brussel sprouts and the Poutine - they were all excellent. For dinner we had the pot roast, Pappardelle and the Hanger Steak. There was more than enough food to fill you up. They also have a great selection of mixed drinks. The only real complaint was the service. Our waitress was waiting on our table inside, as well as some tables outside, so she was a little elusive. And we asked a busboy at one point to check on our drinks, but he didn't seem too interested.  Other than that, a very good meal.",

Don't get me wrong, the food was cooked perfect. My favorite part of the meal was the bone marrow and the tenderness of the steak. So good. I just got lost on the grits and collard greens & pickled mushrooms that were served with it.  Like I said, I'm just too much of a Steak and Potato person to appreciate the variety of the plate.  The service was great, she knew all about the dishes and made recommendations. The atmosphere was good, music in the background and not too bright or dark for the lighting.  The seating, well, the seating was like we were in a group, RIGHT next to the people beside us. So close that the guy next to me jokingly was going to try my dessert! (it was hilarious but his wife was annoyed. haha!)  All in all, the food was good, the place was nice, just cramped and the service was great.  Just not my cup of tea.",

As a lover of sweet wines, the Riesling they had (I can kick myself for not writing down the name) was probably one of the best I've ever had. Appetizers; poutine and the whiskey wings. Oh my gawd, was that poutine amazing. I mean, it is the second time I've had it at M&P and I think it was better this time.  I wish I had some right now, and its only 10 am. The wings were full of great flavor. They were about half a point too spicy for me, so I only ate a few, but the hubbie loved them.   My entree was the short rib flat bread. After we ordered but before it came out I overheard the lady at the table recommending menu items to her date, saying 'order anything but the flatbread, they are good, but not nearly as good as everything else'. Sad trombone for me. I agree with her though, it was good, but... Not the shining star of the meal.  I need to make it priority to hit up meat and potatoes more often. We love it!",

We generally try to squeeze in a visit to this place when we're in town visiting family.

I went with a friend who I was visiting in Pittsburgh and we both got the Irish Breakfast Coffee, which was Jameson, Maple Whipped Cream, and Orange Peel. It was really delicious, not too boozy, just enough to tingle a little bit with the citrus when you took a sip.  We also shared the grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb, and honestly I would have been sold at just bringing me the jar of rhubarb. It was so, so so good. And the perfect portion to not fill you up before your main dish.  For my main, I had the PBLT. I love BLT's as they are, and I've had other iterations of them with avocado and what not, but I don't think I was prepared for this. Pork belly, bacon, arugula, tomato and truffled mayo... AND it came with delicious fries?  Everything was fantastic all around, if you don't give this place a shot you're doing yourself a disservice.",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure of dining at Meat & Potatoes for many different circumstances--I've enjoyed drinks and small bites at the bar, I've used their side-room for a large-party Friday lunch during Lent (sweet life, a fish sandwich menu), and I've had every type of ambience, from a bustling and packed house and a table of five to a slow and early night with a table of two.  I love meat and potatoes. My concern with Meat & Potatoes (see what I did there?) is that your night is entirely dependent upon your server; and, unfortunately, of the many times I've been there, I've almost come to expect poor and sloppy service. Is it really that hard to be a good server at a classy restaurant? My experience in the food industry is minimal (I waited tables at a sushi joint for about a year in high school), but I seemed to think it took more effort to be a bad server than a mediocre server...so why am I constantly plagued with bad service at this place?  Cue rant? My first time was at the bar, and the bartenders were more than friendly--one of them actually recognized me from his time at Embury (\"The guy who likes bourbon, yeah?!\")! They'll make any drink you want, and they'll recommend drinks that you didn't know you wanted. My second time was at a table, and the service was awful--sure, it was a busy night, but ten minutes to get water, followed by a half-hearted \"you ready yet?\" didn't really excite me into a good meal. Further visits are plagued with memories of a server that kept attempting to up-sell (\"Would you like garlic bread for the table?\", or \"How about  refill on your fries?\", which I guess could be understandable--but then, after asking if I wanted a drink on the rocks, and then charging for ice on the check? What? Does this parenthetical even make sense?) When asking about a cut of meat, or even something as simple as a good beer, I've been told, \"I don't know, its meat,\" or, \"Yeah, I don't know, it's all beer.\" I don't want you to think I'm complaining unnecessarily, or that I'm being petty with my critiques, I just expect a server that pretends to care about you or enjoys the job that he/she has.  In short, the food here is delicious. They make a burger with an egg on it (the name escapes me) which may be my favorite burger in Pennsylvania. The bone marrow is rich and buttery. The cocktails are delicious and the bartenders are excellent (a lot of them came from Embury and the Firehouse Lounge). The devils on horseback are perfect. The muscles are well worth the price. The meat cuts rarely disappoint. When I attended for lunch, the simple twist on the fish sandwich was excellent (that potato salad made me drool).  I just can't stand that consistently awful goddamn service.  I'll keep coming back, and I'll probably keep giving 20%, but at least I can bitch about it on the Internet.",

Overall a rather small restaurant, the bar and dining area seemed rather squeezed together in a mosh posh fashion.  Most of the food was great, the chicken liver appetizer was crispy, the burgers were juicy, cooked correctly and delicious, and the brisket had an excellent smoked flavor with plenty of fat.  I gleefully approve of their use of goat cheese in a number of dishes.  The pasta dishes, however, seemed to fall a bit flat.  Dessert cheesecake was served in a cleaned out candle / mason jar, equally as tasty as it was awkward to receive.  Fries were mediocre, overly cooked and a touch salty.  Also, there could have been a larger draft beer selection. I certainly applaud them on their interesting take on a number of mildly mundane dishes though, makes for a unique dining experience.  Prices were reasonable, the wait wasn't long, the staff was tremendously friendly and service was excellent.  Absolutely worth checking out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Hungry for carnivorous creations, we decided we should check out what Meat & Potatoes had to offer our gastrointestinal system.  Since I am a follower of the Paleo way of eating, anything with Meat in the name is A-okay with me!  My friends will tell you that they automatically know and should always assume that if my carnivorous cravings are not quelled they and fellow tablemates will not be appeased with my behavior.    Sooo..here we go!  We asked for options from our foodie friend aka hotel concierge and he also suggested Meat & Potatoes.  Ok, so now that are minds and GI systems are in sync we head out into the blustery Pittsburgh evening.  Our driver told us mid-drive that he heard they turn people away all the time and reservations were definitely suggested.  Since this was a grim possibility, eeek on a Monday in downtown Pittsburgh, who would've thought.  So, we called, and low and behold a 2 hour wait for a table.  We decided to show up and no space at the bar to gussy up to either, fail.  We asked about bar options from the young hostesses, I mean, they're young, they should know what bars are good around their place of business.  They suggested a place a block away, it was closed.  Seriously?   Apparently, after checking further with my handy dandy Yelp app, I came to the conclusion that Pittsburgh is a ghost town on Monday, does no one eat on Mondays??  Is there some secret cult thing here where everyone starves on Monday nights and businesses decided to give all their much needed restaurant business to one restaurant?!  We remembered there was a bar right beyond the entrance to the illustrious M&P's so we decided to check out the show selection and bar.  Much to our fancy they had a FREE show of cabaret singers and a bar!!!  SCORE!!! or GOAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL whichever suits your desires.    We got our free tixs, a few drinks and got a front row table of a packed house and enjoyed the libations until our table opened up.  The service was great until we waited over 45 minutes for 1 plate, yes 1 plate, to come out of the kitchen.  Every table was full, but these weren't plates that anyone slaved over all day.  These meals definitely didn't take 45 minutes to prepare.  We had a hanger steak (7 slices) over german potato salad and a few brussel sprout leaves.  Honestly, I've prepared meals more indepth in less time.  The waiter noticed the concerned, I'm about to go all King Kong in here if I don't eat something soon look on my face the 14th time he passed our table.  He came over and chimed in with \"Oh, we overcooked your steak so it's being redone\"...ummm ok, could you maybe have told me that 30 minutes ago and 2 liters of water ago?!  Our dinner was delish when it finally arrived and $32 later we paid the check and vacated our table.    The hanger steak was tender, juicy and seasoned appropriately.  Most places tend to under season steak and the chef's had a great handle on this.  The german potato salad 'dressing' was tangy, sour, creamy and touched every inch of my palate sending RED ALERT morse code signals to my synapses.  The crispness of the brussel sprouts leaves interspersed throughout the dish were appropriate and provided not only color but another texture to round out the dish.  Presentation was clean and crisp and visually appealing on a long rectangular plate with the slices of hanger steak displayed proudly atop the creamy fingerling potatoes like Tiffany diamonds on display in a sparkly glass case.  I whole heartedly believe in my dining experience starting with a beautiful and aritistic visual display of what is about to happen gastronomically.  It's like porn but better, satiated for a lot longer!  M & P hits all of your senses with muted overall lighting with hints of beautiful dim white twinkles here and there.  The 2 tops are a little strange, cramped if you decided to hang onto your app and start on your entree.  I kept kicking my companion under the table, honestly, I wasn't doing it on purpose this time!    M & P is definitely worth a reservation, make sure you follow this simple step people or you may find yourself out in the cold bitter Pittsburgh evening without a full tummy and cold nose!",

The texture was enough to gag at, and the taste did little to make up for it. I would not order this for an appetizer again, nor would I recommend eating lumps of fat on an empty stomach!  For my entree I got the flat iron steak. Most expensive entree on the menu and I knew why! It was delicious. The steak was a melt in your mouth experience and the wasabi potatoes and shittake mushrooms complimented it perfectly. Cheesecake for desert was a knock out also. Of course, we had to ask for extra berries and the manager obliged.   I wasnt absolutely amazed by meat and potatoes. It was a good restaurant and an experience to try, but the space was slightly crammed. 4 stars though bc good food and great service. I'd go back again to try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "I want to love this place and recommend it to everyone I know, but I cant.  The food is good, great flavors, unique items with a large variety. It really is all about the meat and starches here, and they do it well.  But, if you have a sweet tooth, the desserts aren't go satisfy you.  Its okay though, you'll probably be too full from the snacks, appetizers, and main course.   Now for the bad, I've been their twice and service was terrible, to the point that I'm not sure I'm going to go back.  First visit, out dinner took almost 3 hours.  The waiter was forgetting things left and right and when it came time to pay the bill, we spent 20 minutes waiting .  Our waiter was engaged in conversation with a guy at the bar, and that guy had to point out that our WHOLE table was staring at them, before he came back to grab our cards.  Second visit:  They are particular about getting the temperature of your protein right, they even ask how you would like your salmon cooked (which I think is kind of bizarre).  Given that, I ordered my pork medium.  I got a piece that I had to saw into, definitely not medium.  They right away offered to take it back and fire a new dish for me.  Great I thought.  A long time passes, I see a couple pork dishes come out of the kitchen, none of them  mine.  One of my friends is getting irritated for me that its taking so long.  The rest of my party is piratically done eating their dinner, i'm basically full from eating everyone's french fries, and FINALLY my pork comes out.  Obviously I'm not going to eat this whole meal by my self while the rest of my table, full from their meals and ready to go, is watching me. Sigh...so I pack it up.  The second piece was cooked right, but I'm upset that it so long, I didn't even get to enjoy.  =(",

    "text": "I went to Meat & Potatoes with a few friends this evening, just a few days after their opening. Here's what we ate, what we saw, and what I liked and didn't love about it:  The Drinks:  * I had the Dark & Smokey. Obviously, it didn't have quite the same taste as a classic Dark & Stormy, but it was still interesting. I probably wouldn't get it again though. * Someone else had the Old Canadian, and apparently it was amazing. * The only con I had in this category was that we were there and ordered our drinks during what I thought was happy hour (5:45), but when we got our bill, they were full-priced.  The Food:  * Curry Mussels & Frites - great. A bit spicier than those I love over at Point Brugge, but still a nice dish. The frites were good - crispy where they should have been crispy, but I wouldn't really call them frites. They're just good fries. Anyone who knows me knows that my favorite thing to eat in the entire world is fries, so I'm gonna stick to my guns on this one. Verdict: Point Brugge has the best frites in Western PA. Also, why the heck doesn't Park Bruges offer the same EXACT frites as Point Brugge? It was disappointing to come across that a few weeks back. * Poutine - good. I was hoping to learn that the curds were from the local Arsenal Cheese, but I didn't remember to ask.  * Cheese Board - great selections, every one of them. The preserves were tasty too, and the portion size is spot on. * Mac and Cheese - Lobster. Chunks. Creamy. Just right, and maybe my favorite thing we had the whole evening. * The PIG Dip - basically like a french dip, but with pork shoulder. This was my main, and it was outstanding. The bread remained crusty even after a dip or two in the au jus. It came with the frites and a tasty, crisp apple slaw.  The Interior & Branding: I'm a huge fan of pub and brasserie style interiors, so I have to say, I was almost as excited to go here for the decor as I was for the food. The style is somewhat classic and polished, but still cozy.  * Beautiful, well-equipped bar in the center of the restaurant, with a super thick, classic white marble counter and pendant-style bulbs hanging from overhead. * GREAT branding. Nice work on the letterpress, die-cut business cards and the website. FYI - the hours are at the bottom of the About page. They should be at the bottom of the Home page. * Subtle, yet luxurious tone on tone damask wallpaper. * Comfy, rich chocolate brown tufted dining chairs (I think they're from the Cafe Zao days?). * The chalkboard looks great. It's a bit hard to read from the far corner by the kitchen where we were seated, but I'm fine with that. Apparently, after the age of 30 you start to go blind even if you've had perfect vision until that point. * The only con for me was that the bathroom was not actually in the restaurant. You have to walk outside the main entrance to get to it. Not a big deal, of course.  The Staff:  * The manager came by a few times to make sure we were getting what we needed and were happy with everything. Very nice guy. * Our waitress was hilarious. Yes, she was knowledgeable about the food, but she also educated me and my friends on laser fat removal (just look it up). Priceless, especially after the meal we just had. I felt a tiny bit rushed by her, but it wasn't offensive.",

    "text": "Claustrophobics should avoid this place, since there is very little space between tables. A large bar takes up the entire center of the restaurant, leaving little space for tables along the periphery. Because of the tight spacing and because this is a popular, crowded restaurant, it gets very loud. Many people like that. We, however, had been hoping for a quieter, more sedate atmosphere. On the positive side, the food was very good, though you should be aware that the portions are small and you should order accordingly. Three of us had the black bass, which made us wish we had ordered an appetizer or salad with it. One of us had a burger, which came with a side of Brussels sprouts and was more filling. The lemon berry pie was delicious, but we were a bit disappointed it had berry jam instead of actual berries. The service was quick and pleasant. Meat & Potatoes is very conveniently located to the major cultural venues, right next to the Cabaret, steps from the O'Reilly, and a short walk from the Benedum and Heinz Hall.  Although we enjoyed the food, we didn't like being crammed into a small space. In the future, this will be lower on my list of pre-show places to eat.",

Had an extremely knowledgeable waitress named Rachel that made fantastic recommendations based on the True preparation of the dishes.  There was too much that we wanted to try on their far from ordinary menu, full of interesting dishes.  We went with the Beef tartar appetizer which was so fantastic, smooth, flavorful and the delicious egg topped it off perfectly.  We also tried the tuna taquitas which were great as well.  The Fried Pickles are a must have, the breading is incredible but they are huge.  For entrees we enjoyed the Moules Frites with White Wine Garlic Broth, which the girlfriend said where some of the best she ever had.  I enjoyed their signature duck dish, this was such fresh meat but what really made it for me was the pastrami edging.  The sauerkraut pierogoies were a nice side of the dish aswell.  Dont miss out on their drinks, this was the best Manhattan cocktail ive ever had!  Also enjoyed a drink called the Perfect Sour, that was a great addition similar to a Pisco Sour.  Will be returning soon with plenty of options to try !",

    "text": "I'm so thrilled to have such a charming True gastropub in the city, particularly in downtown where new restaurants seems to pop up then die out quickly.   I had great expectations when first walking in - the ambiance had an upscale comfortable and quaint feel that made one fill right at home. The menu, which was an brown folder with age sheets of paper, had just the right amount of selections as to not overwhelm the guest with too many choices. I absolutely adored the cocktail list, and after 2 trips I have tried the Aviation (a twist on the \"traditional\" version which I believe does not call for grapefruit juice), the Sazerac, and the Old Canadian. The Old Canadian proved to be my favorite, meringue in a cocktail is simply one of the greatest ideas a cocktailian has ever had...go early 1900's.   I'm fairly certain that ever dish was concocted by the devil, everything was perfect! The mussels were fresh, plump, and they didn't have the fishy taste that is all too common in restaurants, and yes, believe it or not mussels really shouldn't taste like that. Next came the duck liver pate, served in a small clasped, jar with a couple slices of toasty, buttery baguette. Unfortunately not enough bread for the large amount of pate. Either way, the smooth, savory taste of duck pate on crunch bread is one I'll never forget. The pork belly potato skins were probably one of the best things I've ever had, though I can't it was particularly good for my health. You have to splurge some times? Snail and blue cheese risotto had great potential, though it was not as creamy as a risotto should be - it was a little on the watery side. I had no idea apple played a role in the dish, quite a minor role to say the least.  Overall, this is the type of place you want to spend some time in, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a restaurant. I could sit in the dangerously comfortable chairs, or the well designed, open bar for hours drinking prohibition cocktails and munching on the small bites. Seriously, you need to go.",

I appreciated that they brought toppings and seasonings on the plate with the bone marrow.   I decided on the short rib flatbread for my main dish, and I was very happy with this choice! The flavor and ratio of cheese, meat and bread was perfect!   We capped off the meal with the chocolate bread pudding that was also very good. My suggestion on this would be a better ice cream. I pictured more if a vanilla bean.   All in all, very good and already looking forward to going back!",

I actually preferred the starters over our main (burger). Highlights: Fried Pickles, Gin cocktail (name is escaping me), Poutine  Atmosphere was cozy and cool. The tables are a bit small and cramped, but luckily the restaurant wasn't too crowded. A great spot that I will definitely be back to if I make through Pittsburgh again any time soon!",

    "text": "Having been to Meat & Potatoes at least ten times now, I've had some really amazing meals here, definitely worthy of 5 stars. But I also think things can be a bit inconsistent here. Although it's definitely one of my favorite spots in the 'burgh, it's just short of perfection.  Just like everyone else in the world, I love love love the ambiance here. I find the chairs a little uncomfortable (probably because I'm short and can't reach the table...I should really consider bringing a booster seat) but other than that, everything is gorgeous speakeasy chic and is a good match for the upscale comfort food theme. It also has a great vibe for some classy drinking, and I'd certainly visit the bar more often if I had the $$$  Also, in love with the brunch. I really do think this is the best brunch in the city. The shortrib hash and the korean brisket & eggs are my favorite dishes, and who can resist a $5 DIY bloody mary bar with house-infused vodkas in flavors like bacon and shallot?? I know I can't...though I wish I could so I could try the various flavors of bellini they offer. If you only eat one brunch in Pittsburgh, this is the one you want to try.  The dinner is where I've had some mixed experiences. The steaks and other mains are usually awesome. The mussels have been less impressive, and on the last visit I ordered a version with \"balsamic pearls\" that I expected to mimic the texture of the salmon roe in the dish. Instead there were just clumps of chewy, stale-tasting balsamic vinegar interspersed among the shells. Something is also off in their steak tartare, and trust me...I LOVE tartare. I just think the flavors they choose in trying to be creative don't always work in harmony. But the simple things, the \"meat and potatoes\" if you will, are done wonderfully, and that's what you should come here for.",

Along with their lunch menu that changes seasonally, they have daily specials. On the particular day we went, my dad and I both enjoyed the Asian noodle bowel which was fantastic. It had fried wontons, grilled pork, broccoli, onions, and jalapenos. Portions are enough that you aren't still hungry but don't walk out thinking you've gained 20 pounds. Their desserts are worth the extra bucks as well. Awesome atmosphere - no complaints!",

    "text": "Well, as suggested I made reservations. However, to get a reservation at a 5:30 I had to make it 4 weeks out. We were about 20 minutes early so we checked in and told the hostess that we were going to be at the bar to get a drink, until our table was ready. My wife was exited to check out the Bloody Mary Bar for $5.00, that we've heard so much about. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that the bloody Mary bar is only for lunch, but he could make her one. So a Bloody Mary and a Jack and Coke came to $22.00 plus tip. Ouch! That was a bit more than we were expecting but we were out on the town and just wanted to have a good time and enjoy ourselves. So 5:30 came and went and we still didn't get a table. So about 5:45 I went back out to the hostess stand and asked about our 5:30 reservation. They told me it would be another few minutes. So we finally get a seat right next to the corner of the bar. The problem is that it was so narrow between the bar and my chair every time somebody went by they would bump into my chair or me. So I asked out waiter if we could move over one table. He did allow us, so that was good. So my wife is sitting against the wall on like a big long velour couch and I was sitting in a velour chair across from her. She was complaining how uncomfortable she was, and so was I at this point. Both of our seats felt like the springs were blown out and we were sitting in a hole. The velour upholstery was all stained up and looked filthy. The mirrors on the wall looked filthy at first, but then I realized they were just old pitted. With all of the high ratings, despite the tiny tables, I was expecting better. So as an appetizer we ordered the bone marrow and mushroom risotto. Both were very good I must say. For our main course I ordered the Hudson Valley Duck Breast and my wife ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron. We both ordered them medium rare as recommended by our waiter. My Duck breast was very chewy and gristly, even after I trimmed off what looked fat and gristle. I couldn't even find a piece that I didn't have to spit out after a few minutes of chewing. My wife gave me some of her Wagyu Flat Iron to eat instead. It wasn't bad but defiantly didn't seem like Wagyu beef. I didn't complain though, I just wanted to get out of the uncomfortable chair I was sitting in and go home. Our waiter asked what was wrong with my dinner because I obviously didn't eat it. So I told him it was very chewy and gristly. He said that was one their signature dishes and after talking to his manager, he took my dinner off of our check. The service from our waiter was good so he got a nice tip, but as for the restaurant, we were very disappointed.",

But when a place is this good what do you expect?!? Get the devils on horseback as an appetizer, you will thank me later! Also, if you are a fan of fried pickles they are some of the best in Pittsburgh. I have never had a bad meal at meat and potatoes and have have eaten here way too many times to review all of my meal choices. The specials are always top notch and you cant really go wrong by ordering one. Just go with the fried pickles and devils on horseback as an app then order anything off the menu for a great dining experience! A+ (it's really dark here so bring a flashlight to read the menu)",

    "text": "Has it really been almost 3 years since my first review of Meat & Potatoes? Well, I think it's about time I author a new review, especially since I've been there a number of times since. Most recently, I had the opportunity to have dinner with several other Yelpers. What I've always loved about this restaurant is its proximity to so many fun and interesting things in downtown Pittsburgh, especially the theater district. In addition, the interior decor and ambiance resonates with the types of restaurants I enjoy going out to for dinner. It's cozy, relaxing, and sexy. Prior to my most recent dinner adventure at MP, I last dined here in December 2014 for my birthday, and before that sometime during the summer of 2014. To be quite frank, I immediately noticed that the menu hasn't really changed much over the last 6-8 months (give or take). I mean, don't get me wrong, the salmon and hangar steak are delish (really, really delish), but I've become bored looking at them on the menu. Give us something new and exciting, MP! Even some of the drinks have been on the menu for a lengthy period of time. We all know your bartenders are extremely creative, so let's see some new items hit the menu. OK, I'll step off my stool now. On the bright side, the food and service were really great. The five of us shared their bone marrow appetizer and a cheese plate. For a drink, I chose their old fashioned cocktail. Having recently stopped into The Commoner and ordering their old fashioned, I much prefer the MP version. For my entree, I ordered the hangar steak. I know, I know. I just complained that the hangar steak has been on the menu for ummm ever, but it is really good and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I enjoyed my meal, I loved every moment of it and really wanted to savor some dessert, but just didn't have the room. Of course I'll keep dining at MP, but would love (really love) to sit down, open a menu and see some newer items listed.",

Our party ordered the marrow (we HAD to try it) the fried pickles, and the bread that came with butter and jam. The marrow was cool. I think it was kinda a one and done thing, but I don't regret it. The fried pickles, however, were amazing!! Highly recommend! I got the beet salad and the buffalo chicken Mac & cheese. Both were delicious.

    "text": "Visiting Pittsburgh and came for brunch on the recommendation of friends who raved about the place when they lived here. I will say the infused vodka Bloody Mary was yummy with the fixings bar and the food when we got it was delicious, we had the Croque Madam and the French toast and took half of both home - generous portions. The reason for the 3 stars was that 45 mins after we ordered we still had no food and no one had come to check on us or explain anything. At that point I flagged down our waiter who went and checked in the kitchen and said that one of the meals had to be re-prepared because it had burnt. However 20 minutes after that we still did not have our meals and the folks that sat next to us who came about 45-60 mins after us got their food before we did. At that point I quietly went out and asked to speak with the manager. He went and checked and confirmed the story but felt they should have alerted him as well to the issue and he did apologize and make it up to us with some bill adjustment. However if I hadn't initiated the conversations I'm not sure if we would still be waiting. The restaurant was not that busy at the time. Overall, the food was good, liked the ambiance and the manager handled the situation well, the waiting without wxplajust soured the experience. I'm writing because several other reviewers mentioned long wait times so might just be something to consider - seems a bit hit or miss.  Update: came to find out that after adjusting the bill that the credit card got charged twice both for the discounted bill and then again for the original bill and that they are going through some new billing system so they didn't know how to take care of  it right away. I spoke to my friend who kept coming here for years and it seems like this is either a) a new problem b) a unique one. Unfortunately it just completely ruined the experience. It's akin to getting food poising. You want to try it again but you would feel foolish to do so.",

    "text": "I would love to have given Meat and Potatoes five stars. This restaurant earns its points with its food. Marrow bones were perfect. Brussels were excellent   The Ribeye was excellent (but it was not 45oz which is 2.8 lbs) before cooking). We had mushroom risotto as a side - really good. The only real food miss was the collard greens which tasted like someone dumped a bottle of Worcestershire sauce into it (we actually used them as the steak sauce).   Where this restaurant missed last night was with the service. When you order a $100 bottle of champagne (or any wine) in a restaurant you expect someone to occasionally pour it for you. When we needed something like plates large enough to fit the marrow bones, you had to flag a waiter down.  Appetizers to be cleared flag a waiter down. This is not a place that anticipates customer needs or where a waiter makes sure you have everything you need with any regularity. We had a cocktail at the bar before dinner. It was a process getting enough attention to pay the check even though at 7pm the bar was mostly empty.   I give the food a solid 4.25 out of 5. I'd give the service a 2.5 out of 5 - about halfway between no service and great service.",

    "text": "I really enjoy their brunch on Sunday's here. I highly recommend making a reservation by calling beforehand. They tend to get a great turnout on Sunday's for brunch, because, who doesn't love a good brunch? They have a DJ on Sunday's and man is it upbeat and fun! We each started with libation: a breakfast brunch drink (light, fruity but subtle) and a passion fruit Bellini. Both were tasty and refreshing. We also got an order of applewood bacon to share. I had the breakfast brisket hash. It was very good, but I wish there were more pieces of brisket. It seemed to be a toss up if the small cubes were a potato or brisket piece, which was odd, but still tasted good. It wasn't as filling as I thought it would be. My BF had the Huevos Rancheros which were more filling and very tasty. I ordered another helping of bacon, toast and a sticky bun for us to share. (4 slices of bacon for $4 I think is a bit steep, but, who doesn't like bacon with their brunch?) All the sides were tasty, but a little pricey for the amount you get. The seating for 2 people isn't overly private with another table for 2 very close to both sides of your table; we would've rather sat at the bar or outside, but both were full. Parking is limited on the street nearby, but there are plenty of garages within a block or two. If you plan on drinking, plan for a more expensive bill.",

We didn't have reservations, but they were able to comfortably accommodate us at the bar.  We had some of their specialty cocktails, which were all expertly mixed, aesthetically appealing, and delicious.  For brunch, I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the flatbread salmon, both from the regular menu.  The chicken was quite possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had, and my friend's flatbread lox was so fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere was interesting and trendy without being uncomfortable, and the service was good as well as friendly.    Additionally, the waitstaff and bartenders all seemed to be enjoying their work, which always speaks volumes to me about they way an eating establishment is run.  I highly recommend Meat & Potatoes to anyone looking for a fun dining experience with original food ideas executed perfectly.",

My boyfriend and I had both called asking about a reservation for a party of 20 and were told to e-mail someone, we both did and received no e-mail back. We called again numerous times before someone finally got back to us less than a week until the party. She was very nice and explained it would be $250 to rent out the back room (not too bad) and a $500 minimum food and drink order, which between a group wasn't hard to hit. But, I had a couple questions about the menu and checks and was never responded back to. When we arrived they had the back room ready except for the appetizers that we had asked to have out when we arrived. Our waiter was really great and he had extra staff helping him which was nice. The food and drinks were all delicious, I had the steak and it was awesome! One downfall is that the room was in the back behind the kitchen so it's very private so we felt a little left out of the cool atmosphere but it's great if privacy is what you want with a big party.   My only one complaint was they knew it was for my birthday and they didn't mention it or even bring out a small desert which I thought was a little rude since we had paid $250 just for the room and our total bill just between my boyfriend and I was over $500. Also, the manager never came into check on us or see if everything was going well. (I've planned big parties like this before and usually they stop in to make sure you're happy with everything). All things considered we will be back for sure but definitely plan a group event somewhere else with a bit more of a lively area.",

    "text": "While searching for a place for dinner with the boyfriend and the pseudo-in-laws, I stumbled upon the website for M&P. Open for less than a year, the menu for this awesome gastropub made my mouth water. A stellar selection of craft beers, decent wine, and a cocktail list using fresh ingredients that could warrant the term \"mixology\" but without the \"mixology\" price tag? I'm in!  But while the casual-hip atmosphere and well-curated libations are definitely reason enough to go here, the food stands out as innovative yet familiar; filling, well-executed, and affordable. Our table started the meal off with an order of their mussels cooked in a white wine sauce and served with fried taters (fries) with a black truffle aioli. These mussels were fresh and quite flavorful with the addition of smokey chorizo, chili, and broccolini- it's broth soaking in great flavor and accentuated with a touch of cream.  The boyfriend's parentals ordered the salmon (pictured at the top of this post) and the roast chicken, respectively. The salmon had a beautiful presentation and was exotic and packed some heat with its Brussels sprout kim chi, pineapple, chili, and Korean BBQ flavors. The Pan Roasted Chicken had more south of the border flavors with black beans, yucca fries, salsa verde, and queso fresco.  Boyfriend went the route of their Hudson Valley Duck Breast which was cleverly crusted with pastrami seasonings and served with sauerkraut pierogies, ramp butter, dandelion greens, and chimichurri- we shared bites of this and I must say, that duck was served at a perfect medium-rare and had loads of flavor. For my entree, the Braised Lamb Shank. I surprised even myself when I made this my dinner of choice, but the description sounded too good to pass up (and it did not disappoint). A giant bone-in lamb shank was placed before me; perfectly fall-of-the-bone tender and covered in a glorious sauce and gremolata. This entree was served on a bed of creamy Tuscan white beans, broccolini, and a bitter braised kale that helped cut through the fatty, homey goodness of the lamb. If you can't tell, I was an absolute fan of this dish.  Completely stuffed from this rich and comforting dinner, we opted to skip dessert. But with Southern Tier's Creme Brulee stout on the menu, the boy and I couldn't resist. Do yourself a favor and head to Meat & Potatoes next time you're in downtown Pittsburgh.",

We also had a few cocktails, I had the dark and stormy, it was well made and delicious. If you saw M&P on food network and you want to visit it is well worth it!",

Shortly after we were seated our waitress came to take our orders. Everything was going perfect.. Until an hour and a half later and we still had not received food. This would be acceptable if the waitress would have came to our table to apologize or to let us know that it would be just a little bit longer, but she did not.   Once the food did arrive, however, it was amazing. I ordered the salmon, which was delicious. Some people in my party had the duck and others had the hanger steak and burgers.   Once it was time for dessert we asked to see a menu and the waitress said that they only did desserts verbally. Then she never said what the desserts were. So we left still hungry with no dessert.  Overall, if you have the time, it's worth the wait for the food. I would rate the food 5/5 and the service a 2/5.",

    "text": "Impressive...so impressive. Another place that makes me gloat about how cool Pittsburgh is.   There was a bit of a mix up with reservations, and the room we'd requested wasn't available. Because of this mistake, though, the manager made sure we were seated, and our party was comped appetizers. Good business!   Those apps were divine: mushroom flatbread, tuna tartare tacos, fries...we passed them around again and again, our eyes telling the story of our love for them.   I had never eaten dinner here before, so I was really excited, and I ordered the pot roast. It's meat and potatoes, people. I'm not leaving here without some mash! While I was waiting on the dinner, I tried the 25th hour cocktail, a blend of gin and citrus that I would love to recreate at home. M&P is well-known for their creativity behind the bar, and tonight did not disappoint.   Now for the meal! OMG. Meat was tender and juicy, and it sat on a bed of the most perfect consistency of mashed potatoes one could ask for. The plate was adorned  with a gravy that brought the whole dish together, and I was in glutton heaven. It was a special occasion, and I hit the gym the next day :)  Of course, we didn't stop there. To complete the celebration of the evening, the table ordered each of the three desserts to share: panacotta, Heath bar, and chocolate Oreo. Each of these desserts comes in a mason jar and is packed with deliciousness. Everyone had a different fav.   Service was outstanding!  Five stars, well-deserved.",

The meal was very reasonably price considering the quality.  Just like the other reviews say: you must try the bone marrow. Nothing beats meat butter on toast.",

    "text": "PLAN AHEAD AND MAKE A RESERVATION. I was visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and I knew I wanted to eat here, but I didn't think of making a reservation ahead of time. Don't be like me. Make a reservation before you get there. You don't want to waste your time waiting for a table, hoping there is a no show. Luckily, I called again another day and they were able to seat us in the \"back room\" within 20 minutes on a Saturday evening! The back room is separate from the main dining area so you miss out on the amazing ambiance, but you still get to order from the same menu.   We had a group of 4 and decided to order a bunch of dishes and share so we could try a little bit of everything. We ordered: --Meat and Potatoes: 34 oz ribeye with sauteed mushrooms, bone marrow, and (mutant) potato wedges. Highly recommend sharing this with more than 2 people so you don't waste any food. The ribeye was meaty, cooked just right at medium rare, flavorful, succulent and fatty. Cut a piece of ribeye and top it off with bone marrow for extra flavor and extra fat. :) --Caesar Salad: This salad comes with fried pork ears. It's delicious! Love the home made Caesar dressing too.  --Mussels of the day with garlic bread: Get it! There were 3 different flavors to choose from. They give you a ton of mussels!  --Lobster Mac: It was good but I wouldn't order it again. They give you large chucks of lobster.  --Pork Belly Tacos: delicious!!! The tortilla is so yummy and you can feel the pork crunch and melt in your mouth.   I love the ambiance of this place. It's a great place for a date night. Order a few drinks and some plates to share for a great night. I love the romantic vibe this places gives off. Round marble tables with candlelight centerpiece gives off an intimate vibe for a nice sit down dinner.",

I want to say something about the seating.   I really don't like sitting really closely to other people. There are many 2 person tables that pretty much line the border of the restaurant. So you are basically eating with the people on your left and right so it makes for a poor experience when you sit next to overly chatty people who want to talk to you and or when you're sitting next to drunk people.   Also I don't know what the waiter looked like because he was literally standing directly behind me the entire meal, because I was facing the wall and there is no room to take the order from the side of the table because the waiter's butt would be in the faces of the table next to you. That is a little annoying to me.   I wish the seating was better but over all it was a good experience and the food was delicious.",

I love the feel and the atmosphere of the place. The restaurant is not big but they did amazing with what they have. In the center of the restaurant is a really cool bar area. It is definitely a hip place for dinner.  We started off with the devils on horseback which are dates wrapped in bacon. They were highly recommended on Yelp and by our waitress so we had to try them. Boy were they delicious. It came in an order of 3 and that was gone within 5 seconds. For our main course we shared the Meat & Potatoes for Two which comes with a 34 oz ribeye with confit steak fries, house made steak sauce and bone marrow gratin. This was so amazing. It is a lot of food for two people but we enjoyed every bite of it. I hope to visit Pittsburgh again so I can try more things on the menu!",

We had a reservation at 8:30pm and waited about 30 minutes longer after that. They were so apologetic and had one of their parties prior to us run a little late. They definitely took care of us with some of their best appetizers on the house. Sometimes, you can appreciate a restaurant or business going above and beyond for their customers, which is really why I get a 5 star review. The service goes a really long way for me.    Now, on to the highlights of the meal:  The best of the starters we had was the Bone Marrow. The only way to describe it is in one word: butter. The fried pickles and  Fried Brussels I could couple together. Both were not overly breaded, which I enjoy, and still crunchy.   The entree is what stole the show for me. I had the Duck Breast and it was probably some of the best duck I have ever had in my life.   All in all, I would definitely go back to Meat & Potatoes if I am back in Pittsburgh.",

One helpful hint before going to M&P would be to try and do a reservation, just to make sure you can get a table as it seemed like a hot spot for Brunch (and have heard it gets packed in general). Here is a my full breakdown of M&P:  Service (5 out of 5): As states, the service was great! The server was very nice and really helpful as this was our first time at M&P. She was an excellent server overall (I was a server at one point and know how hard it can be sometimes).   Decor (5 out of 5): I really enjoyed the decor of M&P and loved the overall atmosphere of the place. Although it was a bit warm for me when I went, I really like that they have an outdoor patio for those who wish to eat outside.   Food (5 out of 5): For brunch, I had the salmon flat bread and my girlfriend had their French Toast. I found the Salmon flat bread to be the perfect amount of food and to be very flavorful! I had some of my girlfriend's French toast and it was certainly a treat! The French toast was cooked perfectly and was the perfect amount of sweet. I would vote for the Salmon flat bread over the French Toast only b/c the French Toast is a lot of food and can be very filling (still worth it to try it though if you are starving or want to split something).   On a side note, M&P also had a Bloody Mary bar. Neither of us had a Bloody Mary, but were sitting next to it. Everything that was being made looked good, if you are into Bloody Mary's.",

They not only served us well but were friendly and talkative, giving genuine recommendations and sharing funny stories.   Ordered a glass of Prosecco for myself and a whiskey drink for my boyfriend, very good. Started with the tartar, spicy but delicious. Then came pate -amazing- and then devils on horseback. Also a little hot but very good. The bone marrow was excellent and the toppings with it were great. Once we got halfway through the bone marrow the bar tender told us we had the option to do \"luge shots\"  of Jameson out of them once we finished. We happily complied and were given bibs to protect our shirts. Lots of fun. We got the tuna ceviche for dessert which was just the right combination of light and sweet and salty and savory and we finished the night off with a shot of Fernet Branca.   Not cheap and unless you want to risk finding a seat at the bar, plan ahead. But a wonderful place, gorgeous decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and amazing food.",

We started with drinks and here's what I know:  The Glenshaw was really tasty, but kind of had a hint of Fall with the allspice swirled into the frothy egg white.  Next up:  The Bramble: gin + blackberry + lemon = summer solstice, for sure.  Perfect.  The Steak Tartar was amazing.  Large portion highly spiced and a little sweet, topped with a smoked soft boiled egg.  The egg was not for me but the others said YAY!  The Mac and Cheese was ridiculously sinful.  Star of the appetizers was without doubt the Devils on Horseback.  Dates wrapped in bacon with manchego cheese and a nicely seasoned red pepper sauce.  There were four of us and our dinners came from all corners of the menu:  Duck for me - generously served and well complemented with a couple of sauerkraut pierogies.  Others had the pot roast, roast pork and pasta - everyone was so very happy.  Loved. The. Duck.  We positively waddled out of there quacking about our next visit.  Better get the reservation made and soon!",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to eat at meat & potatoes for the second time last night, and as the story goes, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  I must admit it did not live up to its 'reputation'. For our first soiree, there we had brunch, and it turned out GREAT! My wife had the short rib hash (poached egg, horseradish hollandaise) @ around $12-14 it was priced right and tasted good. I had chicken and waffles (not as good as chi-town HOWEVER for PGH it was phabulous) and it was both filling and tasted good. SOO good that I made a mental note and put this place on my must try again list.   I thought this was the type of establishment that a blue collar working man/woman, needed and would be proud to say... 'I've eaten there'. Again on that first night. Meat & Potatoes hit all the right spots. Service food ambience you name it they hit every note. These were the best of times!!!  Now we come to the worst of times. My wife/soul mate is my foodie buddy. If I am belly to the bar 90+% of the time she is with me. Monday night was no exception. We decided to end her birthday week celebration with another run at nirvana. We shot for the moon and ended up in the trees:(.  My wife ordered the $14.00 pub burger extra well done. The waitstaff brought it to the table with panache, and the bar was set high. When she cut the burger it was as far from well done as you could be. The burger was red and spewed blood necessitating its return to the kitchen. Upon its return the meat was still a shade of pink that prompted my wife to throw in the towel and admit defeat. What was suppose to be a beautiful evening with dinner and dancing turned into... Just sparing with an almost live cow. Will I eat there again sure. Will it be soon. I don't think so. I am going to give my wife's wounds some time to heal.",

    "text": "Had an enjoyable lunch here, with mostly positives.  I love the decor of the place walking in. The set up is interesting - oval shaped room with couches lining the edge. It feels really quaint without feeling stuffy. Huge bar in the middle.  We tried the fried \"taters\" which were truffle fries, and the devils on horseback, basically chorizo stuffed dates. The fries were great! A very generous portion for $5 and came with yummy truffle mayo. The dates however... the only thing I could taste was the dates, which overpowered the chorizo and the sauce and I would not order it again.  For entrees we got pappardelle and duck and both tried a bit of each. The duck was good overall and I did enjoy it, but the chimichurri really overpowered it, and I love love love the natural flavor of duck that was definitely not highlighted :( The pappardelle (why is this word so hard to say) tasted really really undercooked to me, but my friend refused to send it back...  Personally I liked the sauce, but the dish does taste kind of heavy to me, but I am someone who generally finds pasta dishes a bit heavy. For dessert, we split a vanilla creme brulee, and it was just average. Really really sweet, actually, so that can be good or bad depending on preferences. Acceptable.  I'd definitely come here again and try some other things on their menu. Good experience overall. It's so conveniently located right in the heart of the cultural district - no doubt lots of concert/playgoers take advantage of this.",

Let me tell you ... The steak was cooked perfectly! I would highly recommend that. We also had a bottle of the Malbec wine and that was delicious. The service was great, Emily our waitress, was super nice and attentive. All in all great place great food. Just wish their dinning tables were bigger considering how big the dishes are.",

I got the Bone marrow appetizer and then the Wagyu Flat iron. Although Ill need a decent workout to burn off 1/100th of this meal, I enjoyed it! I think the bone marrow is a once in a lifetime dish because of how decadent it is. But i loved everything about my flat iron. Cooked perfect, correct portion size! One thing I would change was the pickled carrots that came with it. I didnt love it all that much... YAY!",

My friends and I went to Meat & Potatoes as a last stop on the latest Pittsburgh adventure. We decided on brunch, which apparently gets booked out for reservations, so you might want to plan ahead. Luckily the (very large) bar area remains unbooked and the bartenders do take good care of their customers.   While I very much liked all the food I tried - including the MASSIVE grilled cheese and tomato soup, and the truffled fried potatoes. The portion sizes seem to vary quite a bit from dish to dish, i.e. the steak and eggs is tiny.  The highlight for brunch was the Bloody Mary buffet bar. That's right a buffet for Bloody Marys. You order the Bloody Mary, so they pour you infused liquor (jalapeno-infused tequila, bacon-inflused vodka, etc.), and then you go up to the bar for allll the fixings. And there are A LOT of fixings, including all different types of hot sauces.  I look forward to trying dinner on a future visit!",

I was impressed by the songs they were playing during my stay. the music genre was alternative indie pop from 1990's, like Blur and garbage. several tracks were from garbage 2.0 which was beyond my expectation. this surprising music ambience actually is the reason inspires me to write this review.  decorations and interior design were obviously eclectic with a hint of hipstery. but I didn't see young customers at the age around 20's-30's at all. probably because of the price. nevertheless, I was seated next to a 60yr old couple, whom just met through online dating, presumably. being by myself and dropping my ears at their conversations was definitely enjoyable at its best.  oh, hm, about the food, I got horseback riding for snack and mussels for lunch. horseback riding was a bit too sweet in a weird way for my tongue. i left the dates untouched but ate the entire unknown stuffing (it tastes like pork) and bacons and sauce. hm yumm.  the mussels were incredible tasty. however, I got a plane to catch. thus, imma end my review, and it is also because I can. besides, a lot of people mentioned it already.  hope your experience at meat and potatoes is going great like mine.",

Food was the mission and we did not care much about the decor and the music.  So, the back room was kind of a plus.  You can read the menu all you want but your waiter is your best friend.  There was four of us and we all got a smile on our faces at one point or another going through some of the dishes she suggested.  I started with the tartare.  When it came in, i realized that this was going to be different.  In a good way. A must...  Then i went for the mussels.  It was addictive.  The broth was tomato-bacon ish (can't remember what it was called).  The chef is realy creative.  I would be curious to see what would happen if he exchanged or cooked with Martin Picard of Le Pied de Cochon...  Wine list ok.

All through dinner we had to listen to the couple next to us discussing their families and the couple on the other side asking each other questions as if they were reading from a Trivial Persuit deck- 'Do you like to get your nails done...?  Do you have any pets...?  Do you have any allergies...?  Do you have a large family...?'  It was very distracting.  The bar scene looked more to our taste but we had already ordered so we were stuck where they seated us.    We ordered the Mussels appetizer and the 'Meat & Potatoes for 2'.  The mussels were a bit confusing- some were under cooked, some were over cooked, but the majority of them were just right.  The broth they were cooked in was delicious- perfect for 'bread dipping'.  and the bread was delicious- once we sent back the garlic soaked french roll that came with it and brought out grilled sourdough.  I would suggest to anyone that comes here to request the grilled sourdough in place of the butter-logged roll.  Mussels- Pass    The Meat & Potatoes for 2 is a $59 monster 32 Ounce hunk of Ribeye with a tomahawk sized bone perched in the middle almost daring you to pick it up with 'said' bone and start knawing away like a starving caveman.  But, please resist that temptation as the napkins are small and not all that absorbant.  We ordered it Medium and it came to the table on a cutting board that required us to relinquish every other plate we had other than the about 5 inch square ones we were using to place our silverware on.  It definately looked impressive and I could feel the couples flanking us trying not to stare.    The 'frites' they served with the meat were crispy but also greasy.  It was like their oil wasn't hot enough when they dropped them, or they had been sitting around for a while half cooked and they tried to 'freshen them up' with a second 'dunking'.  They were also heavily salted to the point where it sucked all the moisture out of your mouth as you chewed them.  Potatoes- Fail.    Next was the bisected bone that was turned into a 'gravy boat of sorts' where the gravy was bone marrow seasoned with too much salt and baked with top layer of extra salted bread crumbs.  Maybe next time I'll tell them I have high blood pressure and can't have salt.  Marrow-Fail.    On to the glorious looking steak...  My first cut was delicious, although a bit salty (Do they salt the steaks when they age them?)- a nice char on the outside and delicious steak on the inside.  My second cut was very red and rare.  My wife's first cut, was red and rare, bleeding on the cutting board.  There went her appetite.  Someone doesn't know what Medium is supposed to look like... I should have been more specific when we ordered however, we have watched more than our share of cooking shows and know that medium is not supposed to bleed.  It's supposed to be brown on the outside and pink on the inside.  that's the reason we go out to eat steak- so we don't have to time it just right to get it the way we want.  If we were home with this dinosaur hindquarter I could have just tossed it back onto the grill for 3 more minutes but in this confined space and no-where to turn for assistance and my wife's appetite already blown- I chewed my second slice then asked for a 'to-go' container...  Meat- Pass... barely...   I think if we ever come back here we're going to request a larger table, order seperate entrees, be very specific with our orders, tell them EASY ON THE SALT and send back anything that doesn't taste the way it should...",

Though it can be more than 30 minutes they are always helpful with getting you in and out quickly. The food is awesome. I really enjoyed the large steak for two. The service is also very good -- we've never had a bad server and the bartenders are also very friendly.",

It came on a butcher block cutting board that took up the whole table - no room for plates, so when asked by the waiter on being served \"is there anything else I can get you?\" my response was \"Yeah, a bigger table!\"  We had reservations, made over two weeks in advance - next time, Mr DeShantz, seat us at a real table or if you don't have one, then don't take the reservation!!!",

We got seated right away and I started off with a signature drink called Blood and Sand... which was pretty good (anything with Dewars is pretty good).   We got the cheese board for an appetizer which was excellent with sugared walnuts, pecans, dates and homemade peach jam. It was so good I thought my husband was going to get another board so he could eat that as his meal.   For dinner I had the salmon with black rice and my husband had the duck. Both were really good and for dessert we had their custard which was extremely rich... so you could only eat a little but...very worth it.   Our server was also helpful giving us details on the food and recommended a great white wine to pair with my salmon. The wine was light and spicy, and ended up enhancing the spices and flavor of my meal.   Over all, we had a great experience at Meat and Potatoes and we cannot wait to go back.",

Meat and Potatoes is shooting for the downtown Pittsburgh crowd (i.e.,dressed up rich suburban Pittsburghers between 35 and 60). The meat and cocktails are very good, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is upscale. Mussels were ok. The Porter House for 2 is truly excellent.   My  burger was ok (for medium rare, it was much more toward the medium side). Definitely try the Sazerac if you're into cocktails. The bread pudding was tasty.  This would be a good place to go on a date, with friends, or a client if everyone is in the mood for a steak dinner. Plan to spend ~$65 and be overly full. Avoid before the theatre rush; it gets crowded.",

We usually frequent South Side for our dining pleasures but my friend took us to Meat & Potatoes for brunch after our marathon style Saint Patrick's Day rage-fest last year.  Not being a huge breakfast food person but still looking for something to \"soak up the booze\"; I opted for the five-cheese grilled cheese and tomato soup! It was HUGE and DELICIOUS! I'm pretty sure someone at the table had Chicken & Waffles and another had Huevos Rancheros which were also amazing!  I also remember diving into someone else's left over fried taters. Yum!  I needed a nap after this one.  It has been a while since I was at Meat & Potatoes but I remember a large make-your-own Bloody Mary bar.  Great for the Sunday Funday hangy cure.  Next time I am in Pgh, I may request a return visit to Meat & Potatoes!",

We could here some of the Buccos game while we were there which was awesome! I had the Three Little Pigs and my girlfriend got the Pork Mac N Cheese and the Fried Pickles. Everything was delicious, especially the sandwich with the dippy egg on top!   The only thing I will say is that I wish the hostesses were more accommodating because I originally called to make a reservation and the only time they said they could reserve was 10:15 p.m. So I didn't make it. She did tell me they accept walk ins and I figured we could just go and check it out and when we got there they had a reservation at 8:30 available, so we had to wait an hour to sit down which wasn't bad on a beautiful night. I just wish they would have told us that they offer a full food menu at the bar because it was basically empty when we got there, then we wouldn't have had to wait an hour without a reservation. My advice is call for a reservation and if it's not accommodating to your plans, you can just walk in and make a reservation which seemed to get us in there quicker than calling ahead.   But overall everything was awesome! I definitely want to go back and try some other menu items!",

    "text": "Wow. Can we talk about Meat and Potatoes for a second? I went here for the first time last night (finally, I know, stop judging me). I had a mouthgasm. Simple as that.  Absolutely love the ambiance of the place - dark colors, dim lighting, jazzy music... it was just what we were looking for. The feel of this place is classy, but not uptight. The service was friendly, expedient, and professional - to the level of a five star restaurant, while still putting out a casual, relaxed vibe.   I started off with a \"Turn the Beet Around\" ...yes the song kept popping into my head throughout dinner, and yes I did dance in my chair while sitting. I love anything spicy so it was already looking up. Reposado, lime, orange liqueur, jalapeno, and beet syrup. It was quite an unusual winning combination. Smash together, fruity/spicy/a bit of savory, add tequila - and it just popped.  Next was the duck liver pate. At first the sweetness of the sauternes jelly on top cuts through the more savory flavor of the duck, but it rounds out as you eat it, and has a nice savory finish. Its perfectly paired with a simple grilled bread (to which they gladly brought a refill).  Shortly after, came out the wild mushroom risotto. It was definitely good, the mushrooms were tasty, but I'm having trouble remembering details because of what came next!.......   The roasted chicken! It definitely stole the show, and I'm not afraid to say, it's probably the best thing I've eaten this year.  Served beside their yukon gold potatoes, adorned with roasted tomatoes, olives, and pine nuts, laid on a saffron butter sauce, and topped with fennel. This dish was clearly crafted by a True culinary artist. Besides the chicken being perfectly cooked and juicy, the way the flavors came together was just something I had never tasted before, and we just kind of sat there in awe/bliss until it was all gone.   I couldn't believe that we had drinks, appetizers, and dinner for two, at this quality for only $77. Last week I paid almost $200 for worse service and mediocre food at another place downtown. I must get back here asap.... I need that brunch in my life. See you soon!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go to Meat & Potatoes for a long time. I have heard such good things so this was a place I really needed to go to. Lo and behold I was asked to a late night birthday celebration! It was held on Monday after 10.   We were presented with two menus. A late night menu and the regular menu.  I was torn. The late night menu was $5!!! And the menu looked amazing, mussels, oyster, patty melt, shake and bake chicken, and an assortment of flat breads! Wow, what a great menu and a great deal.  But would the portions be enough? Or was this a sampling menu.   I was hungry. I didn't want this $5 menu to turn out to be some sliders and a chicken leg. So I asked the waitress about the portion size. She said that they were small, but still good and made a shape with her hands that looked like a slider sized bun.  OK, I thought to myself, better go with the big girl menu.  I ordered the Kimchi Ruben from the regular menu. The rest of the party went with the late night menu, and ordered two of each of the $5 plates.   My food came first, and it was delicious. The bread was thick and crusty, and did not get soggy even the next day. The corned beef was cut to perfection and the kimchi (brussels sprouts) was spot on. Just enough spice and heat to make me want to try it again.   But, then the rest of the food came out. And let me tell you, that  $5 menu was no joke. The flat breads were so good. I got to try the greens and chilies flatbread. OH MY. The greens were cooked to sweet perfection and when you took a bite it was heaven, with that kick of chilies mixed in. Just enough to make you go, \"WOW\" but not overwhelming. The Patty Melt was amazing. Juicy, cheesy, and the bread was thick and toasted just right. The mussels were marinating in this amazing buttery garlic sauce that made you dip your crusts of bread in it, just to get another bite. So good.  (Can you tell we shared plates?)  My only complaint is that if the waitress wouldn't have told me that the sizes were small I would have saved some money and just ordered off the late night menu. But I was not disappointed with my order or all of the other dishes I tried at all. And it makes me want to go back soon. This time, I will focus on the late night menu!!",

We arrive late on a Thursday, after most shows downtown had started, so the restaurant was not crowded.   We sat at the bar, which is usually a great experience, but today, the 3 bartenders didn't feel like making eye contact or being even nominally friendly much less serving.  No one greeted us when we sat down, and it took forever for someone to take our order.  The drinks were wonderfully prepared, as usual, and the food was solid.  However, they forgot part of our order (seems to be a theme if you look at other reviews), and the staff just seemed to be uninterested in being there or dealing with customers.    Guests near us seemed to be having the same experience -- surly bartenders, distracted staff.  Would have been a 4, but service has got to improve.",

We were promptly seated - there were 5 of us. I didn't even notice the portions other people had at their table, but I was about to be surprised.  I got the Lavender drink, which was pink and bubbly with a good combination of sweet/tart. Then I ordered fried taters with a truffle mayonnaise. We all shared those and they were gone in a split second. Super delicious! Someone else got house-made granola and I only tried a spoonful, but the dish was ginormous.  For the main dish I ordered chicken and waffles. Before I knew it, what looked like a whole freakin' chicken was in front of me with waffles and a bourbon bacon syrup...which I accidentally spilled all over the table. I was kind of mortified even though the waiter was like \"Psh, you're fine!\" and got me another side of syrup. Everything was really, really good. I need to go back and eat everything!",

We stopped for brunch on Saturday (3/31) and it was great! My boyfriend got the grilled bread and brisket hash, and I got the \"Nashville hot\" chicken and waffles with a side of home fries. The chicken and waffles were massive! Everything was absolutely excellent! I also got a mimosa, which did not disappoint either! It was definitely full, especially being that we got there at 10:40 with reservations, and for only being open for 10 minutes, the place was pretty packed already. I suggest you make reservations, which is the advice we were given and I'm glad we listened because we wouldn't have wanted to miss out! The service was great, the atmosphere was relaxed and fun, and the DJ played the perfect brunch music. After being in the city for 5 days, we decided that out of all the places we ate at, Meat & Potatoes was our favorite!",

We shared the Bruschetta and the short rib hash. Both were unique takes on two homey dishes. The bruschetta was quite unorthodox in that there was no raw tomato salad. It featured crostini topped with mushrooms, eggs, chimichurri, and goat cheese. It was very savory. It had a great spectrum of textures including crispy, soft, and creamy.  The short run hash was essentially short rib and soft cooked potatoes under an egg with horseradish hollandaise. I felt this dish was quite savory too, yet it had a more complex layering of flavors.   During Saturday brunch, they offer a build your own Bloody Mary at the bar. The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was just as good.",

They are used to eating at more upscale restaurants and are try foodies so the thought it was fantastic. Or waitress was awesome and made us feel very welcome. I mention this because we have beenough to other upscale places with the kids that act like we don't belong because we have kids with us. Not here. The food was excellent!

First off, the fried pig ears came out in a red/white striped French fry basket you'd see at a fair. Not the presentation I was looking for. Also thought they were way overpriced. The bread was okay. Nothing too fancy about some toasted bread.   The steak on the other hand was huge! Great presentation. We ordered it topped with truffle butter which I loved, but my boyfriend wasn't a fan of. We also ordered a side of scalloped potatoes and they were bomb! The steak was extremely fatty though. Overall, I would say most of the weight in the steak came from the bone that was attached and the fat. There wasn't a whole lot of meat to it.   All in all, I would say that meal wasn't worth almost $150. The steak is more of a once in a lifetime thing just to say you ordered a 45 oz steak. We probably won't be going back, but it was a decent date night.",

The seats are so comfy, the table is roomy, and the beer is cold. And, the food is amazing.   Came in for an early reservation, at 5:30. Was sat immediately, in the well decorated dining room. Ordered a Victory \"Summer Love\", due to Nicki's (our AWESOME server) suggestion. Before i had half of my beer gone, my order of Bone Marrow was steaming on my table. This. Stuff. Is. Amazing. The kid that brought my food told me how the breakdown went, as I was popping my marrow cherry. He described the marrow at \"meat butter\". There are no better words. Bread, sea salt, herbs, capers and pickled onions accompany the marrow, but you don't even really need them! Still, amazing with.   My entree came next, the Duck. I originally was super excited about the duck, but my first bite of pickled cauliflower turned me off. I chugged a little more of my beer, and went to work on the duck. It was perfection. They can keep the pickled cauliflower next time.    Dessert was a red velvet gob cookie, I love red velvet, but this was a little weird and hard to eat. But hey, everything else was amazing, so I'm not gonna complain!!  Happy Eating!",

Had to try the bone marrow, which was meaty, fatty and flavorful. The mussels I had were fabulous too, with a slightly spicy broth. Enjoyed the devils on horseback, just wish there had been more. My husband got chicken of all things, which he thought was super tasty.  Someday I'm going back and taking my Dad to tackle the tomahawk.",

It's not that the food was terrible, but it just wasn't impressive. We got the ribeye steak for 2, which was ridiculously salty, to the point that it wasn't enjoyable. We would have sent it back, but it takes 35 minutes to cook and we had to head out to see a show. Totally not worth it. I did like the strawberry and goat butter appetizer and the drinks were good. The service was also good. Overall, it's not an awful place, but I'm definitely not dying to go back. There are so many better restaurants in Pittsburgh, in my opinion.",

    "text": "During my first real visit to Pittsburgh I had the joy of sitting down to a meal at Meat & Potatoes- being from Philadelphia people have a lot of bad things to say about Pittsburgh (not sure why, probably because we're just mean), but the meal I had here did many things to break down these rumors and start me toward thinking that Pittsburgh could be an awesome place.   The waitress we had was super attentive and friendly and any place that serves things in jars basically has me hooked from the onset. As for the food, I tried the tacos and mac n cheese simply because I was having serious trouble deciding and just randomly picked, and I was not disappointed with my choice. The mixture of meat/bbq sauce/apple slaw creates quite the mouth-gasm upon eating. and the mac N cheese was so rich I had to take half of it home- it was simply too great. I suppose my only complaint might be that the neighboring table (and perhaps my dinner companion) might have heard my moderately audible moans. whoops. so impolite. but moving on...  Being that I've only been here once I can't quite give them a 5 star rating only because I think I'd need to eat another meal here, but from what I've tried I can certainly say they've got my attention, and I would certainly repeat my visit to try all the other delights they have to offer.",

Ambitious menu, attractive space and branding, serious cocktails...you name it, M&P seemed to be doing it right.  The primary problem is I just don't think the food is good enough.    It's not that it flat-out, irredeemably sucks (when you use quality ingredients there are sure to be some good flavors there), it's that 1) foods that are shamelessly unhealthy really have to be off-the-charts tasty or it's not worth it; and 2) it's not cheap for Pittsburgh. Case in point: the fried brussels sprouts somehow lacked any semblance of crispiness.  If I'm looking for soggy and greasy any local dive will do.        Unfortunately the service was also brutal when we went.  We ordered a starter for the table that somehow came after the dinner was entirely over, and the waiter disappeared for long stretches for reasons unknown.  This wasn't during the opening days either.  At this price point I can't imagine winning many diners' loyalty with the level of service.  I'm happy that places are taking on ambitious menu offerings. Perhaps M&P can evolve into a really good place, I hope it does. But until then I'd rather go to Primanti's.",

We were split up into 2 tables which was fine.  There was a private room by the kitchen for bigger parties.  The place was packed at 6PM on a Saturday night.  We ordered drinks-I had the Ronaldo, which featured house made raspberry vodka. It was as sweet and delicious as I thought it would be.    As for the menu, there are quite a few vegetarian sides and appetizers, so we got the mushroom flatbread which was amazing.  Fresh argula and shaved parmesan really completed the dish.  For dinner, we ordered the only vegetarian entree, which was the pumpkin ravioli.  For me, I don't mind having few choices when I go out to eat-I usually find the smaller the menu the better the dishes are.  I wasn't disappointed with this dish.  The raviolis were stuffed with pumpkin in a creamy sauce that was light and flavorful.  I only wish there were more-it was that good!  I'm not a huge dessert eater so we didn't even look at the menu.  I took one star off for the service.  When our flatbread came out we weren't given plates and couldn't flag our waiter down for them.  He also never checked to see if we wanted to order another round of drinks-another waiter came by and helped us instead.  Other than that, it was a great meal.",

It works perfectly for a late dinner after the opera, or a casual meet up with friends. The menus are printed and presented in a black manila folder, and specials are written on a blackboard. The service is casual but competent. That is, you feel like your server is in on the whole concept of the place; they're invested, and they're not out of place. Everything was fresh, tasted homemade, and the portions were bigger than I anticipated. One of the best parts is that it's not expensive. We had 3 people, each with a drink, and each took home food, for ~$70 total.   And they've got a brunch?? I'm just too excited for words.",

I was delighted by my dish which truly brought me to heaven. I was jealous of my date's meal, though it more appropriately should be called \"A Chicken with and waffles.\" Seriously though, it was more food than either of us could handle, and made a lovely chicken salad throughout the rest of the week.  It is indisputable that the food and cocktails hit the spot. However the atmosphere makes the speak-easy vibe fall short. The high ceilings, metal riveted ceilings reminiscent of Walmart, and overly packed space ultimately disservice the intimacy created by the seating and mirrors that I am guessing the establishment is striving for.  Despite the ever so slight problems with the architecture, this spot is not one to miss. Located within the cultural district, this a happening, distinguished yet casual restaurant where you nearly feel transported to another time with food that is out of this world!",

Two of us went on a Friday night around 10:15 PM and were seated outside with no wait -- but there were still plenty of people around eating and enjoying, which was pleasant.   The staff was friendly and accommodating, and I can be a pain in the butt sometimes (gluten) so it was nice to feel taken-care of.   We ordered:  Bone marrow appetizer: delicious.  Waldorf Salad: surprisingly boring and iceberg lettuce-y, given the description on the menu. Tartare: meat was fresh, they had to leave a few things out for me because they were not gluten-free so it was missing a bit of something. They brought a sauce out for my dining companion and he said it made a big difference.  Hanger Steak entree: nothing wrong with it, but it didn't taste as interesting as the menu made it seem like it would be.   For a \"we're hungry, let's grab a bite\" it was fine but overpriced.

Every item on the menu was something I would order.  I ordered a black IPA but the waitress brought a regular IPA. This wasn't a huge deal for me, but when I asked her about it she said she would check on it. She never came back or offer to change it to what I ordered.

    "text": "I like Meat & Potatoes. I've been there several times but I just went for brunch, so let me write about that.   I had a daily special which was the pork belly with savory oats, fruit kimchi and a fried egg. This is one of the more unusual dishes that I've tried there, and it really worked for me. The rich pork balanced well with the acid in the kimchi.  I sampled some of my dining companions' choices as well and enjoyed most of their dishes. I tried the brisket flatbread, which was excellent; the eggnog French toast, which was good but didn't really excite me; and the sausage and biscuit (another daily special). That last one. Man. It was oversalted. Like: Dead Seas oversalted. It was sent back and quickly replaced with something more enjoyable. The coffee was good too.   Service was good but sort of... hover-y. Plates were removed from the table as soon as the last bite was consumed (or prior to in one case) . Almost all the serving staff has an earpiece which gives the place a bit of a Secret Service feel---not the most relaxing vibe for a lazy Saturday brunch.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Several months after M&P had opened, i ate there one night as a walk-in and was seated within minutes on a Friday night around 9:30pm. The food was so delicious, I was truly impressed. So, for some time shortly after, i regularly brought friends and family there to dine. Literally, no matter whether one was seated at the bar or on the floor, the service was excellent, on par with some of the more expensive casual dining establishments in New York City.    Then, due to a change in my regular routine, and because my friend was between shows at CLO, I stopped dining there so regularly, and ended up not returning to the place for several years.  Well, i worked in a research lab at Pitt for many years, and we would often have doctors working with us for a year or two to fulfill a post-doc or fellowship program, many of whom are not from Pittsburgh, or even the U.S.  So i recommended M&P as a \"fantastic\" place to dine after a new doc asked for a recommendation of somewhere to eat in the Theater District at some point a year or so after I ceased being an M&P \"semj-regular.\" You can imagine how foolish I felt to have her return to me the following Monday only to relay the message that she had a terrible experience.   Then, fast-forward 2 years (now this is about a year and a half ago), and Im at the Christmas market with my \"new\" boyfriend in Market Square. We had a wonderful afternoon, but suddenly our hunger crept up on us, and we realized we were going to get \"hangry\" before we could wait out a table at Nola or anything immediately in Market Square, so I think of M&P and feel assured - as it was only about 4:30pm at the time - that we could get a table quickly for a quick bite to eat before their dinner rush came in.  Now, by this time, Meat & Potatoes had apparently become a \"popular\" place to eat - and the rumor was it was so posh, you had to wait weeks for a reservation; but for a place called Meat & Potatoes, it should be pretty obvious how ridiculous that wait time should seem.  Well, we arrive, and its about 4:45pm - the hostess asks us if we've made a reservation. I say no, and she says with a shitty attitude, \"Oh, well, I'm sorry, we're booked for the night, and we strongly recommend you make a reservation with us *weeks* in advance\" - she emphasizes \"weeks.\" Thats the end of the conversation as far as this dipshit is concerned.   So, i calmly asked her if there was bar seating available - and then she tells me, yes, in fact, it's first come first serve. Well, how lovely - seeing as how they were closed between 2:30 and 5pm to turn over before their dinner rush, and we happened to be there right as the doors were opening at 5pm. So- because I asked - we were told we could be seated at the bar in about 10 minutes. But here's the thing: I have since never gone back nor recommended the place to anyone bc i will never again risk bringing someone and having a hostess piss them off.    Here's a short list of places I would recommend, instead: Sienna Mercado, Nola, or Sharp Edge if you want comfort food. Tako if you want pretentiousness and ambience for half the same price, wait time, and minus the bitchy hostesses Ten Penny if you want pretentiousness, ambience, and decent food but little to no wait time  And if what you want is fantastic food with no pretentiousness, AND little to no wait time, then skip downtown altogether and go to Lawrenceville.  Umami/Izakaya is fantastic Japanese street food and a unique ambience within Pittsburgh. It sits above Cantina which has decent tacos and good happy hour drink specials. Piccolo Forno nearby offers delicious italian fare for cheap, and is BYOB. But if you like grappa, dont hesitate to have a drink or two at the grapperia behind the restaurant while waiting for your table, or as a night cap. Tender, further toward the 50s on Butler St, is like a 1930s art deco oasis with crafted cocktails anywhere from $9-15 a pop; they're worth it and they're the star of this place. There's BrilloBox on Penn Ave & Main St, which is, in my opinion, hands down one of the best \"bar food\" experiences you can possibly have in Pittsburgh (there and maybe Yesterday's in Greenfield), and even the vegan food at this joint is so fantastic, even I choose it from the menu from time to time, despite my intense distrust of anything \"vegan.\"   I mean, i can keep going, but the point is, Meat & Potatoes developed hype because its service was once top notch and its food was inventive and a delight to one's senses. But, sadly, it seems to have become rather lackluster in the minds of many, including my own.",

    "text": "Incredibly happening place with a great atmosphere and even better food.  We began our evening at the bar and received incredible service despite how busy it was.  The beer selection was suitable and their take on an Old Fashion with a hint of spice made itself the drink of the night.     We began with a few snacks including the devils on horseback and the wings.  My only qualm was that there were only 3 of the devils on horseback for $7.  Hard to share when you have more than 3 people.  Considering we drank most of our appetizers at the bar, we opted on just ordering entrees at that point.  All were delicious.  My red snapper was outstanding with accoutrements that possibly outshined the fish.  Other entrees such as the Hudson Valley Duck Breast was so reasonable in price considering it was an entire breast with sauerkraut pierogies for only $19.  Our dining partners raved about the hanger steak and the pasta.    The menu is so well versed, there is undoubtedly something for everyone.  The proteins were cooked perfectly but what really impressed me was the originality of the sides that accompanied the proteins.  It's funny, but the name is deceiving...they are by far more than just meat and potatoes.",

    "text": "Just like everything else in downtown Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is overpriced. That being said, you're probably paying more for the ambience than the food, which (as the name would suggest) is traditional American. I was actually really excited when I first stepped into this place. The menu reads like a who's who of American cuisine. Unfortunately, I may have ordered the wrong dish (lamb burger). I found it dry and unsatisfying. I'd definitely be willing to give M&P another chance once my meal ticket comes in.",

    "text": "We came here per an out of towners rec cross referenced with yelp. From the start it was a bad experience. We put our name and number down for our 40 minute wait. We asked if it was okay to walk down the block to check out the bridges. We get a call 10 minutes after we left telling us that it's going to be an additional 30 minutes as our table was just \"given away.\" We were literally down the street so we walked back to ask what the deal was, something about her forgetting to put us on the list (yet we were there when she did Plus it was right next to the phone number they called us on...) The three ladies up front suggest we might have better luck at another spot down the street. But we were determined to eat here. So we stand around. 10 minutes later we're seated. The hostess really needs to learn some time estimating skills.  The meals: the French toast was good, not amazing. The candied bacon was a nice touch. The rancheros were nothing to write home about, pretty boring and not a lot of flavor. The chicken and waffles were about the same, there wasn't a whole lot of meat on the chicken so it was basically fried skin and waffles. I didn't try the pub burger as I'm not a red meat eater (I'm new to the meat eating game.) we ordered some bread to start as we were all pretty hungover from the wedding the night before, it took forever to come out.  The Bellini was decent, apparently the Bloody Mary bar is \"amazing\" so if you're into a boozy brunch bar, there's that. The staff were pretty lax, had to ask a few times for coffee and water refills. The space it self is huge, but there was a live musician which cramped it up slightly. That being said, it was rather loud, we couldn't really hear the folks at our table chatting. The bathrooms are not even inside the space itself, but outside to the back in the lobby. Overall, I'd slip it, but I think I just have higher expectations from places with 4 stars",

I was slightly taken aback when we were asked if we wanted bread with it, which was an extra charge. Not sure how you're supposed to eat it otherwise, but I definitely enjoyed it. I chose the salmon for my entree and it exceeded my expectations. So amazingly flavorful, I'd have to say it's the best salmon dish I've ever had. My only complaint about this place is the seating. I understand they have a small space to work with but the tables are extremely tiny and very close. It's almost awkward when another couple is seated beside you and there is essentially no table room left once the plates arrive.",

While the backroom was nice for talking to all members of the party, the decor was extremely plain and did not match the rest of the restaurant.  For dinner I started out by ordering the poutine as an appetizer.  This was the first time that I had ever had poutine in Pittsburgh and it was a good resemblance to the popular Canadian dish.  I was also lucky enough to taste some of the tartar which came on top of bone marrow.  Both of the appetizers that I had were very good and I was happy to have ordered them.  My entree was the duck breast which came on top of mashed sweet potatoes and red cabbage which was topped with a nice sauce and brussels sprouts with bacon.  The duck was cooked perfectly and I even enjoyed the potatoes which was odd since I am not normally a sweet potato fan.  I also had the pleasure of trying both the bass/papperdelle dish and the three pigs.  Each was excellent!  The bottom line for me is that my dinner here was the best dinner that I have had in a long time.  With that being said I am really looking forward to coming back and hope that it is in the near future!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went last Friday to celebrate my birthday. We had a reservation for 9:30p. We arrived there around 9:20p and was seated in less than 10min. Which we truly appreciated because we were starving! We heard so much great things about this place that we couldn't wait to experience it ourselves! Unfortunately, we were seated right by the door that opens up to the outdoor dining. You would think that with reservations, we would, at least, get a decent seating compared to when you are just walking in without one! A staff and a customer tripped on my girlfriend's seat in the process of going out that door. Very annoying to have people walk by your table non-stop during dinner while you hope that none of them would tilt a tray of food/drinks into your heads.   When our waiter came, his name we couldn't pronounce but sounded like a foreign name (Enie, Enye or something like that), he was very standoffish. We told him that it's our first time there but he didn't seem to care. My girlfriend asked about the wine as she doesn't want anything dry but our waiter dismissed her with a \"all of our red wines are dry\" comment. Then he left to give us time to decide without offering any help or suggestions. When he came back, I told my girlfriend to pick whatever she wanted so she ordered Reisling. When our waiter came back, he didn't even look my way, talked directly to my girlfriend (btw, we could hardly understand him in the first place!) and serve her the wine to taste and approve instead of serving me first. He asked my girlfriend about what we wanted to order, still not addressing me as he should have. Was he trying to insult me? We let it pass but my girlfriend was getting upset. If it wasn't my birthday and that it was late, we probably would've walk out of there by then.  Our food came and I have to say, it was delicious! The bone marrow was what everybody said it would be and the chicken liver was great! We had the 45oz ribeye and it was perfect-- charred on the outside, pink on the inside! We enjoyed our meal despite the non-stop stream of people going in and out that door right next to my seat!  Needless to say, we enjoyed the food but not the experience. It was very disappointing considering how hard it is to get a reservation in this place. Maybe they should remove that table by the door and remind their waiters to be more friendly and polite especially to those first timers in their restaurant. We tip that waiter 20% for his rudeness. Maybe he would be nicer to others.",

I'm glad that was all we ordered because that main dish was humongous. Fried pickles were delicious, very light and crisp. And the main dish was awesome too, cooked just as we wanted and came with delicious mushrooms and potatoes (as the name suggests).  The reason for 4 stars is because we weren't informed that our main dish would take an hour to prepare and our wait for our food got a little anxious towards the end like \"did they forget about us?\" etc. Other than that it was a very smooth experience.",

Read good reviews and had high hopes and they did not disappoint. Literally some of the best brunch food my husband and I have had and we're big brunch fans. The most impressive part was the perfectly poached egg on my hash, which is really hard to find. Our server was lovely, the Bloody Mary bar well stocked and we could not have been more satisfied. This is officially our Pittsburgh brunch spot.",

    "text": "Had an amazing dinner last night at Meat and Potatoes. The Ribeye for 2 was truly worth the 4 hour drive from Philly!!! Extreme flavor, perfectly cooked, and throughly filling! The host stand also serves as a stand out of amazing service as they were helpful, caring and worked with our early arrival when they didn't have too. The only two things from a five star review is the seating and service. Seating was too tiny. In other words, even only ordering the ribeye for 2 almost took the entire space. Plus the bench my son sat on,and commented on by the other person on the bench, seemed broken to the point that they sat on their jackets to get more height. Lastly, the service seemed put out, lacked warmth and, more importantly, no real attention to our table even though it took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive.",

    "text": "I love this place!  I couldn't wait to try it when my boyfriend and I came to visit Pittsburgh one weekend because he is obviously, a meat & potatoes guy.  We were pretty hungry, yet wanted to save room for their 34 oz. Ribeye.  He started with a caesar salad.  It was different, but very delicious.  The crispy pig ears and chicarrones added a great crunch to the salad since it was sans crouton like the usual.  The boyfriend really enjoyed it.  Meanwhile, I had the fried pickles and devils on horseback lol.  The fried pickles were great, but I wasn't too into the devils on horseback.  I've had them differently at many other places, so a description with what's in it would've been nice.  But when the Ribeye for two came, we couldn't wait to dig in.  First off, we were seated at a tiny table, so the wood board basically took up the entire table.  But the seating was very comfortable because I had the booth side, which was similar to a comfy couch.  They gave us little plates.  Although there was a lot of fat on the steak, it was still a really good amount of meat as well.  It was cooked perfectly and the wait did not feel long at all.  We got the mushroom ragu on the side and they put it into a dish for us.  Steak fries were crispy and delicious, but we were pretty full from the steak.  We also added a side of mac & cheese to have with the steak.  All in all, we had a great experience and wish we lived closer so we can come back.  Meat & Potatoes was also located in a great area and the bar looked like it'd be a good spot to grab drinks before a night out.  The ambiance was great.",

They give you a huge helping and its enough for 2-3 people.  In addition, the mussels are amazing. They come in a different variety of sauces and are soaked with flavor and have no 'fishy' taste as I've experienced with other mussels/seafood of this variety.  The atmosphere is very classy and refined but still hip and fun to be in. They have late night burger and food specials that are extremely cheap and reasonable despite being a high end resteraunt.",

Seated promptly, nice looking restaurant,  though they didn't have the heat on and it was freezing.. Heeding the warnings of other posters, I specifically asked for no added salt, and while my cassoulet was still on the salty side, it was quite good, my other dining companions had the pot roast, both agreed it was salty. They shouldn't have to hide flavor issues with too much salt. We tried the famous bone marrow appetizer.... wouldn't have that again, basically flavorless - and salty.  The service was not what one would expect for a restaurant in this price range ($140 for 3, with tip, no drinks, no dessert), just mediocre. Someone needs to focus on proper serving for a table. One should not have to ask for basic things like extra water.  My meal itself was good - not \"scream out loud this is the best place I have ever been\" - but good. Would I go back? Probably not simply due to the salt level and the poor service.",

    "text": "I've been to Meat and Potatoes several times now and and both occasions the food has been very good. Last night I went for a late night bite and some dessert. Given the late hour we were able to walk in and get seating, though this is certainly not the norm. Usually I have been given a rather long wait time if I just try and walk up. Reservations are definitely recommended. Last night was certainly a pleasant surprise and they hostess was friendly and happy to seat us right away.  On this occasion I got the charcuterie which came with several smoked meats, olives and pickled vegetables. The cauliflower was exceptionally good and I enjoyed all the meat. My only gripe (and this is nitpicking) was that the bread was large pieces of toasted bread. I tend to like  more pieces or toast points, but again, I'm just being persnickety. Yes, i did just use that word, I;m so pretentious sometimes.   The dessert was fantastic. We shared two desserts, a white chocolate panna cotta with blackberries and a rich chocolate mousse like dessert. Both were absolutely phenomenal. I really enjoy places that make their own desserts.   On a previous visit I had the Meat and Potatoes for two, which is a perfectly seasoned 34 oz Ribeye, Confit Steak Fries (which are perfectly seasoned potato wedges really) and the most interesting part, a Bone Marrow Gratin. It was my first time trying bone marrow, which I thought was good and matched well with the steak. My date did not care for it much (in all fairness she didn't care for me much either so I wouldn't put much stock in her tastes :) ).  Overall, the food here is very good, and I've never been disappointed. The only thing I really don't love is the seating. I always feel like I am crowded by the tables next to me. I have ample room to move and I don't bump elbows or anything like that, but the tables are just close enough to take away the intimacy of the small 2 seater tables. It's not a deal breaker, but the only real negative I can say about the plate.",

If you like sours, the bar makes their own homemade sours and they are really good.  I loved my whiskey sour!  Dinner was pot roast for my friend and I had the heirloom tomato feta salad (on the specials) and the curry mussels, which were fantastic!  I love the spice and thickness of the broth, which make for delicious dipping for the garlic bread.

The food not only looks amazing it tastes that way too... But I decided to indulge in the \"Dub\" burger and fries... And I had the \"Grilled\" bread with jam and goat butter for an appetizer. And as a beverage I tremendously enjoyed the \"Nino\" cocktail.   This is far from my last visit....I highly recommend eating here before a show, a date night, or just a night on the town!",

Oh how I miss eating steak tartare all night long in the back kitchen when the chef wasn't looking. Short rib flatbread is amazing appetizer as well. But if it's your first time, go with the meat and potatoes for two. I included two pictures of the steak tartare and the watermelon civiche straight from the back of the kitchen from when I worked there.",

Very creamy and full of mushroom flavor. I would have preferred the actual risotto to be softer it was firm but everyone seemed to enjoy it. For main entree I had the steak rare. It was cooked perfect, has great flavor and was melt in your mouth good. The prices here are on the high side but the food quality is high. The cocktails menu is great and they have a awesome brunch. I would give a 5 star if the menu was expanded a bit more with more fish options. But then again it is named meat and potatoes for a reason.",

The staff at the host/hostess station should not be picked for aloofness. Sadly this was their forte. Short, terse 'greetings' and avoidance of eye contact. This did not make for a good first impression.  The waiter was much better. He was attentive without being intrusive.  The dining room experience was too much like a rave. The music was too loud and too techno. If you want to run a night club, run a night club. If you want to run a restaurant change this.  The most positive thing I can say about the menu is that it's 'varied'. If you're expecting \"meat and potatoes\" they're there, but in pretty odd ways. I get it, off beat equals haute cuisine for some, not for me. To each his / her own.",

Good selection of wines and beers too.  We started out with the Devils on Horseback appetizer - OMG, the flavors!  I'm glad the waiter suggested we add a 4th to the order of 3, or my husband and I may have fought over the last one.  I had the lamb shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender, and my husband had the salmon, which was prepared to the perfect doneness.   I have a gluten allergy, so I was grateful for the GF menu, which has most of the regular menu items but modified to be GF.  We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night, so we went early (5:15) and had no problem getting a seat for dinner at the bar, which was a fun spot to be.",

Upon arrival we were told they were booked for the day but they had an area in the back of the main restaurant we could sit in and would be seated in 20 minutes (yay). We were led past the main dining area which is super cute and cozy with a DJ spinning tunes. The area we sat in was brighter and a bit nosier but we were just glad to get seated. We both ordered the Chicken and waffles. It comes with a half chicken which is pretty generous considering most places only give you a piece or two. The chicken was super crunchy, almost a bit too crunchy and slightly overcooked for my taste. It was also a bit too salty. I opted to get the Pittsburgh ranch dusting on the side and I'm glad I did because otherwise I would not have been able to eat it. It wasn't a bad meal but I have definitely had better chicken and waffles. I would come back at dinner time to check out other options when I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Chef/owner Richard DeShantz has received a lot of accolades for this restaurant and his other nearby dining options, Butcher in the Rye, Tako, and Pork and Beans.  His menus are exciting and his food preparation is outstanding.  I can't say enough about their strong service model and romantic/laid back atmosphere.  You want to linger over your craft cocktail or seasonal draft beer just a little longer when you're dining here because it's so relaxing.  The food is exceptional.  I really wanted to try so many of the appetizers but we were running late for a show at the nearby Benedum and didn't want to feel too rushed.  Straight into the entrees then!    I had the Pappardelle pasta dish with Bolognese sauce, pancetta, pork shoulder, and garlic bread.  The noodles were delicate and perfectly cooked to just a smidge past al dente.  The flavor was really spectacular; so good that I overlooked the fact that my dish simply wasn't very warm when it arrived.  The bits of pancetta created a really delicious bite; one that I would go back for again and again.   My partner tried the Wagyu Flat Iron steak for $38 that came with charred fingerling potatoes & onions, corn pudding, avocado, and pickled peppers.  The steak was perfectly cooked and not an overwhelming cut to eat.  The sides were very nice flavor blends to accompany the steak.  The Negroni cocktail we ordered was a little too Campari forward and when we asked our waitress about it, she said that was how it normally looked color-wise so we just added a sidecar of gin to sort that out nicely.  It was such a delicious and enjoyable dinner, we are still talking about it today.  It's such a great little space in the Cultural District.  Definitely make a reservation unless you don't mind parking yourself at their bar.",

For appetizers I ordered the brussel sprouts and poutine. The brussel sprouts came topped with lots of Parmesan and was crispy and delicious. The poutine was huge. It came smothered in rich gravy and large cheese curds. We were nearly full after the appetizers, but our 34 oz ribeye came out onto the table. 34 oz is no joke and came with a bone marrow gratin in the bone. The ribeye was so incredibly thick and juicy that I think I died and went to heaven. We asked for it medium-rare, but as I cut toward the bone, the meat was definitely rare. I didn't mind this but for those who like their meat less red, keep in mind that because the meat is so thick, it might cook unevenly. There was a nice fatty trim that melts in your mouth. The bone marrow gratin was to die for, although there wasn't much of it. The marrow was incredibly buttery and the crispiness from the breadcrumbs paired nicely. I definitely recommend grabbing a friend or two to order the ribeye if you decide to come here!",

I was left unsatisfied for the $200+ bill.  We ordered the: Poutine Bone marrow Pate Pub Burger Meat and Potatoes for two (we didn't get potatoes)  I felt much of the food was overdressed with too much salt. Not allowing the meat to shine.",

I had been traveling Asia for 3 weeks before coming here so I was craving some good red meat.  I came here on a Sunday and was seated pretty quickly.  I went straight for the wagyu flat iron, cooked rare.  Honestly, I was kinda underwhelmed.  Maybe my taste buds weren't adjusted back to the American palette yet but my steak was really salty.  It was very soft but I needed a few glasses of water to finish.  Overall, the place is really nice and I'd definitely give it another shot but it just wasn't worth the price on my first trip.

The brunch items I have tried so far have been satisfying, but just a little off the mark for me in terms of flavor. Although everything I've tried has a strong (salty?) flavor, I've also felt a little underwhelmed and craving a more complex/less bland flavoring. Also when I ordered the brisket hash I found the portion to be a little small (however I was right off a plane and very hungry, so that might have had to do with it). Overall I would still say that every dish I've tried has been solid and my experiences there have been happy. I have heard that dinner is phenomenal, so I would love to go back to try that!  PS: When I was seated outside on the marble tables I found that the table combined with the unique dishware and eggs made my meal very instagrammable, if you care about that.",

    "text": "Is there an option to give the drinks, dessert, and snacks a 5, and everything else a 3? If your primary goal is to grab a few drinks and small bites before/after a show then this is probably your place. The drinks were unique and delicious definitely worth stopping in for, but the main entrees were less than stellar.  A nice, fancy meal it was not.   I really wanted to like this place a lot more than I actually did. Is this place more hype than substance? I'm left wishing we had gone to Butcher and the Rye instead. We made reservations a few months ago via Yelp and had really high hopes! The sitting areas were super tight, and the plush high back chairs were difficult to move and get in and out of. We did appreciate how well the staff worked together to clear tables, and how the servers checked with patrons to see if they had a timeline to work around (trying to make it to a show etc.)  I went with the Roast Chicken (chicken, garlic sausage, marble potatoes, heirloom squash and broccoli rabe) and my husband went with the highly reviewed pot roast. For the chicken, there was a mix of flavors that did not taste pleasing. I kept eating, and mixing thinking it's probably meant to all be eaten together rather than one or two items separately. I was getting a flavor profile similar to sauerbrauten (german potroast). I will say, the heirloom squash in this dish was the singular bright spot. How it was dressed or seasoned (apple cider maybe?) oh so, good. I'd eat a plate of just that - five stars right there!  The pot roast was alright as well. We both commented the entree needed more pepper. No salt and pepper shakers available at the tables though. Some gristle was lurking in between the bits of meat, so you never knew what you were going to get. Was it outstanding, no, was it good - a solid good in my opinion.   Okay so dessert milk chocolate pot de creme (other options were a cheesecake dish, and berry lemon cake/sorbet combo.) This pot de creme was oh so good, with the perfect amount of chocolate with a luscious texture. It's so hard to get desserts right, but thankfully this one was done right.  Finally, we both went home with leftovers from our entrees. Usually leftovers taste the same or better the next day. This was not the case, sigh. The pot roast was again alright, but the gristle that was hiding among the untouched mashed potatoes was not appetizing. I gave the chicken another shot, and while the chicken just by itself tasted better I realized the offending flavor in the dish was the sausage. I can't quite pin what was unappetizing about the sausage, but it did not go well with the vinegaryness of the rest of the dish. I love sausage, but this did not play well with others.  We had a hard time believing this restaurant is under the same umbrella as BATR. If we had gone to this establishment first, I think it would be a hard sell to try others in the brand.  Last tip, parking. There's a few garages nearby that seem reasonable during non-events, but we happened to have dined when The Price is Right was filming in town, so.....that was $15 for parking. We've parked downtown before on a Saturday night and it was a few bucks, so this was a bit of a shock.",

Another friend ordered a burger and said it was fine but no different than other burgers. Another friend ordered the burger that came with pork. The pork was s big piece of fat that she had to remove. I ordered the catfish tacos which was really the only thing on the menu that interested me. They were good but really, I was at a restaurant named Meat and Potatoes. Silly me, I thought I would be ordering a nice seared rare filet with some fingerling potatoes made special by the chef. I was very disappointed and won't be returning. I just can't figure out why they are doing so well with all of the truly fabulous restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

For dinner my husband ordered the lamb shank with white beans and kale - very good and incredibly tender lamb shank. I ordered the duck breast - only complaint - the chimichurri sauce seemed misplaced and combated with the delicious flavor of the duck breast - would order again - but request no chimichurri.   Found this restaurant when in Pittsburgh for a weekend - have already recommended to two different friends planning trips within the next six months.   We weren't able to get reservations until 9:45 - but it was worth the wait. Recommend making reservations a few days beforehand to ensure you get a time slot that works for you. The decor is fun - but was very happy to see that the food out-shined the decor - as sometimes it tends to be the more hip the interior - the less quality the food - not at Meat and Potatoes!",

Good food, good service, wheelchair accessible including the bathrooms, although the dining room is more than a little tight!  I definitely recommend reservations if you're in a chair like my husband, although we have had good success just showing up, even if it is a little uncomfortable for the people that need to squeeze by his chair.",

    "text": "I ate here for the first time last Friday, so 2 days ago.  Pros:  - Food.  Decent fare with some rather interesting items.  I enjoyed my beef tartare and my mussels.  However, Point (and Park) Brugge's mussels are leagues better.  Nothing wrong with these ones though.  - Beer.  They have some nice choices in terms of quality, although it seemed like the number of choices was a bit limited.    Cons: - Service.  The first person I encountered was an incredibly rude hostess.  If you're the girl with the very curly, red hair and you're reading this, get out of the service industry.  It obviously doesn't suit you.  She ignored me, then was rude to me, then told me it'd be a 45 minute wait, then ignored me again.  On the other hand, the other hostess was congenial.  She was able to seat us right away.  Our server was also nice as was our food runner.  Nevertheless, the hostess is the first person you see and helps set the tone for the whole experience and my started off poorly.  - Food.  While my food was fine, my friends' was not.  They each got a sandwich that consisted of a breaded pork cutlet, ham, bacon and topped with a fried egg.  The problem is that the cook put a copious amount of salt on top of the egg.  Let's go over this.  You have a sandwich with ham and bacon and you're dousing it in salt?  No.  - Decor/theme.  I know almost everyone on here enjoys the look/feel of this place, but I feel it is just all over the place.  In some ways they make it feel like a western style saloon.  But then they have the servers in mechanics' uniforms.  Additionally, mason jars are being done to death.    Verdict: A decent enough place, and I wouldn't mind going back, but I'd rather go to other new places or ones I consider better before returning.  Not a bad choice if you need a place to eat before/after going to one of the theaters.",

The service was excellent and the drinks were good.  Our kids both had Mac & Cheese with the pulled pork (no chorizo) and it was ok, but too much cheese for the mac, and the pork did not work well with it.  My husband had the Korean Reuben, and he said it was way too salty, as were the fries.  He also said the pungency of the kimchee overwhelmed the sandwich, and he couldn't taste any of the other flavors.  I had the fish and chips and they were awesome.  The fish was skate, and it was really delicious - lightly breaded and fried, but not greasy.  The taste of the fish dominated, and that was a good thing.  The chips followed the theme of being too salty.  Overall, it was disappointing.",

The bone in ribeye is epic and absolutely must be shared. The fried chicken is also really great. Oh and the barrel aged whiskey? Yeah, I love it.   Their brunch is also really goddamned good.

I enjoyed their version of a grilled cheese which included an amazing pickled green tomato not to be out shined by stellar bacon! The Bloody Mary bar was a hit but I chose to enjoy a lavender bubbly drink that was delicate but sweet! The only minor suggestion I may make would be for the front of house staff to not so obviously walk through so frequently to check the status of your meal to determine their wait time, it made us feel rushed or judged. However, the food, drinks and waitstaff was on point and I have no complaints! Can't wait to go back!",

I thoroughly enjoyed the goat cheese butter and toast!   My main meal was the roast chicken and potato's with gravy, and yes it was heavenly. I made sure to eat every last bite even if I was full.   The waitstaff was also very kind and friendly and was always making sure we were ok. Even a manager came at the end just to double check.   All in all a great experience!",

In addition to being on a different planet from store-bought cured meats, M&P's house-cured versions of traditional terrines, hams, forcemeat and garnishes put the carnivorous delicacies served in other major metros to shame. Combined with the kobe+marrow+capers appetizer and it was hard to believe we were in Pittsburgh and not at a coastal foodie mecca (and I've been to a few).  I had the Branzino, which I rarely order because it can be so generic, but I needed to stick with something low-fat for health reasons. Not disappointed in the least. Whole fish, including head, served in a lovely copper dish on top of a kind of ragu of vegetables and small potatoes. Skin on, head on but NO BONES. Stuffed with lemon and herbs. OMG (and I never say OMG) this was so flavorful and easy to eat compared to the usual \"whole fish\" experience.  Will definitely find an excuse to go back again. While service can be lacking on a busy night - the food quality and creativity are worth the wait and then some.",

The idea is apparently to reclaim old classics, with things on the menu like chicken pot pie and devils on horseback.  The pot pie was fine, although it seemed overpriced at $20.  The sweetbreads were OK, but lacked the silky delicacy you expect from them.  The fries that accompanied the burger were limp and uninteresting.  It's really not bad, and it was fun -- everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves, and there was a great friendly vibe.  The service was attentive if not particularly effusive.",

We arrived on time and were taken to our table by the bar. The restaurant was busy but not packed. We ordered our drinks and then waited.  .  And waited. . .  And waited. It took our server 30 minutes to take our order. Having 7 years of restaurant experience I was dumbfounded that it took this long. I'm honestly still in shock. When our server finally made his way over to our table, I ordered the special pancakes- cornmeal with lemon and blueberry. Our food also took quite a long time so our waiter provided us with monkey bread to share as an appetizer on the house. The monkey bread aka glorified cinnamon roll was a sugar explosion in my mouth. Yummm. I liked it so much I took one to go with the intention of giving it to my husband but ate half of it myself later on. As far as my pancakes were concerned, I wasn't as impressed. They tasted like cornbread with blueberries. I wasn't able to find the lemon at all. Another disappointment, the syrup. I was given standard maple syrup. The dish could have easily become 4 stars with a warm blueberry sauce or lemon creme anglaise. I also ordered a side of the peppered bacon with my pancakes. The bacon was delicious and savory. It added another dimension of flavor to an otherwise bland meal. All in all, I would not return to MNP for brunch. But, I do want to give dinner a try for some (hopefully) delicious meats and potatoes.",

Also had the chicken livers and fried pickles and both were very tasty.  My personal favorite was the roasted bone marrow.  It came with parsley garlic, sea salt, capers and pickled onions.  It was so F-ing good!!! For our main courses i had the pub which had pork belly a fried egg and havarti cheese.  It was messy but so good.  After all the apps i couldnt eat the whole thing and didnt touch the moutain of fries it came with.  Other entrees were the wagu flat iron with wasabi mash.  Def the 2nd best thing on the menu besides the marrow. The pork shank was as big as a football and had great flavors.  It literally melted in your mouth.  At a place called meat and potatoes we did have someone order pasta!!  What a sucker!  The papperdelle was very very good tho.  Our server did a great job and drinks were great too.  They dont have bottled beer which while that seemed wierd didnt take anything away from the great time we had.  Atmosphere was awesome and ambiance matched.  We finished with coffee and choc mousse.

The place has a cozy, romantic vibe; if rustic chic is a thing, that's a fitting term for the decor. I had the soft shell tacos (soft shell crab, pickled carrots, cucumber salad, mint, cilantro, Thai chili sauce; $14) and Sgt. Peppers Old Fashioned (Bulleit bourbon, black pepper, thyme, lemon, whiskey bitters; $9), both of which made the most of the many flavors involved. While I'm not much of a cocktail person, I do love a good Old Fashioned, and they did it justice. Ultimately, it was probably for the best that my reservation was nudged out of peak time, because the relaxed atmosphere and attentive-yet-casual service ended up being just the right mix for the end of an evening.",

Burgers were all around tasty. I blew it & ordered the brisket samitch which was soggy. Shoulda had the Wagyu. Stupid stupid stupid!! The Langer had the duck & said it was delicious.

    "text": "Meat and Potatoes is a gastropub that is conveniently located next to the O'Reilly Theater in the Cultural District in Downtown Pittsburgh. There is a lunch and dinner menu during the week and a brunch and dinner menu during the weekends. We attended during Saturday Brunch before a performance at the theater. We made a reservation in which I highly recommend. Those that did not opted to leave due to the wait time and patrons with later reservations did not find luck getting a seat earlier. I didn't have much wait time at all as my table was provided shortly after arrival. The seating is very close and crowded. There is not much privacy or room to move whatsoever. But lets focus on why we go to restaurants, food and service. Our waiter was very patient, pleasant and did a great job refilling our water. The food was plentiful. The servings were much larger than I expected. We ordered the fried tators with truffle mayo and potato gratin as appetizers. The fried tators were seasoned tremendously. May be a bit salty for some, but they were great to us. I elected to get the chicken and cheddar and jalapeno waffle. There were four large pieces of chicken which included a leg, thigh, wing, and breast. I was full the entire day off of this entree. The bourbon bacon syrup offered a tasty contrast to the heat of the waffle. My date had the french toast which was equally large and delicious. If you want to be full, enjoy a flavorful meal, don't mind crowds or tight seating, the brunch at Meat and Potatoes is highly recommended.",

For appetizers we tried out the fried brussel sprouts, poutine, bone marrow and steak tartare and the short rib flatbread and EVERYTHING was delicious.  I've never been a big fan of brussel sprouts, but with the crispyness on the outside and tangy dipping sauce, I'd get them every time at Meat & Potatoes.  I had the short rib bolognese for dinner. I highly recommend it! The chunks of short rib just melt in your mouth.  My boyfriend had the flat iron steak and he liked it as well.  The place was very nicely decorated.  You could meet up here for a drink after work around the center bar or a nice dinner date.  (the chairs are super comfy!)  I hope to make it back for brunch sometime!",

    "text": "I had a horrible experience at Meat and Potatoes. I chose to go to the restaurant to celebration my graduation with my doctoral degree. We arrived to the restaurant at 6:01, admittedly one minute after our reservation time. The hostesses said that they had CANCELED our reservation because it was at 5:30 and we were late. I had spoken to a staff member earlier that day who CONFIRMED my 6:00 reservation. I told the hostesses this and showed them the phone call on my phone. They still continued to say that my reservations were at 5:30 and somehow had the audacity to state that I never confirmed my reservation, despite the evidence. Eventually, another staff member, who was also rude, said they would \"fit us in\" and gave us a table after about 20 minutes of waiting. All the while that we waited, the hostesses were giggling and staring at us. They truly acted like junior high children, it was absolutely absurd. I can't believe that a restaurant of a \"high quality\" would have such employees. We finally got seated and waited an extremely long time for our food. Once it came, it tasted like it had been sitting for a long time. No one at our table enjoyed their entrees. I was so upset at the time, because this had ruined my celebration, that I didn't ask to speak to a manager then. I called and Facebook messages the staff the following day, sent them photos of my confirmed reservations, but NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM! I would never recommend this restaurant. They are extremely unprofessional and do not care whatsoever about their customers.",

Mashed potatoes were just eh, ok at best.........the lobster mac and cheese, AGAIN one note taste, just a heavy cheese sauce (Velveeta like), way too much sauce to noodle ratio...wasn't bad, but not what I would hope for from this place. Even my cocktail tasted like it was made from a mix.. I ordered the peanut butter/banana cake...but it was just stale cake crumbles in a mason jar with peanut butter and cool whip-like substance on it...not that good.

The atmosphere is relaxed and casual (unlike Cafe Zao, the previous tenant of the same space), and the food is really tasty!  I am also a fan of their unapologetic meat-lover attitude. (There are some limited vegetarian options, though True vegans are probably out of luck.)   I recommend the bone marrow, the lamb, and their daily mussels. Also loved the panna cotta dessert (was salty caramel when I was last there).   The service is a bit mixed, depending on whom you get.  When asked for suggestions for a non-alcoholic drink, one waiter shrugged and said \"water?\" while another got the bartender to make a super delicious drink (peach and ginger soda with mint and stuff).

    "text": "I would have given 4 or even 5 stars had our service been good, but it was really inattentive, lackluster and more typical of Eat and Park than a more upscale restaurant reputed to be one of the city's best. We waited 10 minutes for just water, then 15 minutes for our drinks. It was busy but that was too long to wait.  The brunch menu was offered but we were never told the specials (in fact, as it was my first time there I didn't know there were specials.)  We learned of them only after our waiter recited them to our table neighbors, 2 men, who came in and were immediately waited on after we had finally ordered. They sounded tasty, and I would have ordered one had I known. The waiter never came back to us until we were done, even though he chatted amicably with the neighbors. Had we wanted or needed anything, we were left to keep wanting/needing it. Only the water and food servers appeared to pour or deliver. I guess a 2nd mimosa was out of the question. I haven't experienced this attitude in Pittsburgh for a long time and was frankly astonished. I suspect it was that we were 2 women on our way to the theater, but who knows? We were dressed well and are friendly to servers so there was no attitude from us. The reason doesn't really matter though; it only matters that it was unreasonable. We allowed 2 hours and it's a good thing we did. The food & drinks were excellent, the younger crowd was buzzing, music loud and energetic - very fun atmosphere. Portions are huge - ridiculously so. However, the most ordinary service, on a day of a small celebration, was a huge disappointment. I would give it one more chance because my husband would love this place. Hopefully there won't be a repeat of that service.",

    "text": "Meh. This place shares their restrooms with the Cabaret theater, but somehow convinced themselves that they're way better than they actually are. I don't get the hype. I live around the block from here and so I've tried this place, I'd say, about 20 times in the last year. I've only had a descent experience once. Why come back if it's so terrible? Because they are open on Sunday and Monday when most places downtown are closed. And being from Nyc I love going to my neighborhood spots. Also, my husband loves their papadelle. If only they treated their customers well. Everyone that works here thinks they're to good to be there, and the manger is actually the worst one. We get it. You're a very busy establishment. Doesn't mean you get to treat your customers like crap. Leave your money. There's so many new and better places in pittsburgh to try",

We had the mac & cheese brisket for an appetizer, so so good!!! The brisket was the best part actually but all in all delicious, we both thought.  I had the duck he had the lamb, med rare on both is the way to go. There was a pickle cucumber side for mine that was devine. He didn't offer me any of his lamb (not sure if this relationship will last lol) so I cant give a review about that. We sat at the bar because they do go by appt, not sure if its just cause it was Saturday and there was a hockey game tonight and football game tomorrow. We could either wait 45 min for a table or sit at the bar, we were here at 4:55, place opened at 5! By 5:15 bar was completely filled and only 2 tables opened...but not for long. Staff was amazing! Spoke to two other people at the bar a local and a fellow visitor from Jersey. Just a great crowd!!  I will definitely be back during the summer for warmer weather, and to enjoy more food (4 weeks post jaw surgery, so I was limited). Recommend for sure!",

If you want a brunch table you really need to call ahead.  We started with the make your own bloody Mary bar which blew my mind.  You get a choice of several different alcohols and a mass of options to throw in them.  The choices literally blew my mind.  The knowledgable bar tender warned me not to overpopulate my bloody Mary and I'm glad I took his advice.  They literally had 20 kinds of hot sauce to finish your drink with.  We started with the seared pork belly topped with an egg and kimchi.  It was phenomenal I'd go back just for this. The appetizer was last meal good.  I had the short rib hash and my guest had the Irish breakfast(forget the real name). Both were awesome.  The service was good and the place was bustling. The only downside is that it's really small, this wasn't a problem today but I can see how it would be.  Will definitely return",

Food is amazing.  Everything we tried we raved about.  Chicken & waffles, short rib hash, scratch-made everything.  Huevos Rancheros will make you want to live here.  3.) Brunch is affordable!  4.)

    "text": "The first time we had been was for our anniversary on 9/24/16.  The food and service were both great.  We did have some issues though which is why there is only a 3 star rating.  If it hadn't been for the food and service being so good, probably would've given a 1 star due to the issues being listed below.  First off, the lighting, like so many other high end restaurants was horrible.  I will never understand putting out such stunning looking food and then having basically no lights in the dining room at all for the patrons to see how beautiful the food looks.  Secondly, the night we were there, the draft beer system was down.  While this most likely isn't an everyday occurrence, it still was an issue the night we were there.  Third, the tables are so crammed together, you're basically eating dinner with complete strangers sitting in your lap.  The tables are literally only about 18 inches apart.  It makes for a romantic evening not being romantic at all with having the feeling of complete strangers sitting at the table with you, but hey, anything to make more of the all mighty dollar I guess.  And lastly, my brother in law ordered a gift card online for us for Christmas 2015.  We brought in the printout and the server told us that we needed the actual card.  To date, neither my wife and I, nor my brother in law's family has ever received this card our server was talking about.  I don't see how it takes more than 10 months for a gift card to be mailed from Pittsburgh to Cranberry Township or to Lakewood, OH so it just seems like the restaurant took a $25 donation for absolutely nothing.  It's sad since the food and service were so good that I don't believe we will be returning.  As good as the food and service was, it does not outweigh the issues, especially just taking money from my brother in law and giving absolutely nothing in return.  Once again though, anything to make more of the all mighty dollar, including not honoring or sending gift cards even though money was exchanged for the gift card.  Definitely a way to make more money by charging for a gift card then not ever sending it.",

Despite the fact that I was semi-annoyed we had to drive into town from the 'burbs' during a trifecta of parking-hell (Pirate game, Regatta and \"Furry\" convention), I couldn't have been more pleased with our meal.  $20 parking was excessive, but to no fault of the restaurant.  Started with a steak tartare appetizer which was the best thing I've eaten in recent memory.  Followed it with the \"surf and turf\" special that, although a little pricey, was simply wonderful.  Wish we could have saved room for dessert, they all sounded terrific, but will have to wait for our next visit.  If you are expecting a private dining experience, Meat and Potatoes isn't your place.  Tables are very close together...so much so you could eat off of strangers plates. My wife hit a grand slam with this one though, can't wait to go back.",

Several people told us to check out this place after I had seen some great reviews online, so we decided to give it a shot. I have to admit I had some pretty high expectations going in due to all the good things I had been hearing and this place hit the nail on the head. I could not have been happier with my meal or with the service. The staff was extremely attentive. The restaurant was crowded when we went (on a Monday night) but I think it added to the excitement and the style. The menu is very different from what you can find anywhere else, they have unique combinations and a very good variety. For example, my boyfriends dish came with Kimchi fried rice and the star of my meal Wagu beef cooked perfectly. I would recommend to anyone and if you're visiting from out of town this is a MUST!!",

The portion was more than enough and we left some in the bowl only because we didn't want to fill up too much.  I had the lamb burger-medium, as recommended by the chef. The generous serving of hand cut, shoestring fries were crispy and cooked until they were dark golden brown and served with a side of spicy ketchup, which was also fun. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu. Fun atmosphere too. Although I'm not in Pittsburgh often and I hope to make it back here sometime.",

It is generally reservations only if you want to sit anywhere other than the bar on a normal day for dinner. It is a bit overpriced for what it is, and their \"claim to fame\" has always been their Roasted Bone Marrow entree.  My wife likes to eat here when we go to see shows at the Benedum or Heinz Hall..... so I basically can't escape it without risking her ire on our night out.  Usually when we go, my wife will order the fried chicken kidneys/livers(interestingly good), Poutine(subpar), and sometimes the Bone Marrow(novelty imo). I've had their Burgers (meh) and Hot Chicken sandwich..... which tastes great but is super messy to eat-be warned.  The drinks are overpriced for what they are so don't expect to get out on the cheap. An average mixed drink is around $12-15 and a Domestic Beer will run you almost stadium prices.  We've sat at the bar in a pinch, since you don't need a reservation to sit there, and the bartenders are all very attentive. The bar is a tad bit crowded sitting however..... you might be sharing your neighbors meal at any moment.  I could never come here again honestly and feel like I'm not missing a thing..... however, I know I'll be back next time my wife and I go see a musical.",

It was pretty busy, so if you can make reservations I recommend them. They have a nice brunch menu covering all the basics from sweet to savory. I had the fried chicken and waffles Nashville style and my friend had the brisket hash. The fried chicken and waffle portion was HUGE. They really did not skimp on the chicken. The only annoying thing was that the waffle became super oily from the fried chicken. I ended up not really being able to enjoy the waffle as it was soaked with oil. I was also expecting more flavor from the chicken. The brisket hash was delicious! If you like eggs benedict, I highly recommend it. There was a decent amount of meat and the hollandaise was perfect. The brunch prices are very reasonable as well. Overall, a good place to go before a show as it is so close to the Benedum!",

    "text": "I find places to eat sometimes by purely seeing which few spots are the \"most reviewed \" in an area. This was #1 in Pittsburgh, so I went!  Appearance: I drove RIGHT by this place once because I couldn't see the signs in the windows for it. Lol. It's a surprisingly small, quaint, cozy gastropub tucked into the first floor of which looks to be an office building that you have to walk through a lobby to get to. The big windows at the back of the restaurant unfortunately face the side of another building, but the 2 giant ones at the front give you a decent view of the street. It's all street parking, so good luck with that.  Atmosphere: I LOVED it here! OMG! The giant, high ceilings, the interesting light fixtures, the staff uniforms and the freaking mirrors that curved with the walls were awesome. It was hype in there! Loud, but a good loud, like people were having fun loud, but you could still talk to the person next to you or more importantly, the bartender! I enjoyed that the bar was the center piece of the whole establishment and everything basically was designed around it! It just made so much sense.  Service: Blake took amazing care of me. Great conversationalist, made good recommendations and he made me feel so welcomed there. He was attentive and amazingly friendly which just made my experience that much better.  Food: I started with their Hot Cider which comes with a shot of Crown Royal Apple. It was absolutely delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol... so I added more, quite a bit more. Lol. Blake raved about the Smoked Wings here, so I just HAD to try them. 12 for $14.00 in a place like this, so I thought it was a great deal and OMG. They were AMAZING. I'd pay regular price for these all day long. They're smoked for like 630 hours, tossed in their whiskey buffalo sauce, fried, then tossed in that sauce again. They come out in a skillet on a wooden plank topped with green onions with your choice of sauce. Huge wings. Like, when I tell you I was going to eat these then move right on to the main course, these wings stopped me dead in my tracks. I had to force the last 2 down and was so glad I ordered them.  Value: Looking at the menu there was a bit of sticker shock. Meatloaf for $25.00, Roasted Chicken for $25.00 and their famous 45 oz. Ribeye al la carte for $75.00. Things were a bit pricey, but for what I paid for MY meal (partly why I went with cheaper options) I felt it was a great value. Perhaps if I'm feelin' spendy, I'll splurge on one of the more expensive entrees.  In conclusion, this is totally somewhere you have to come check out. I had a great time here all by myself sitting at the bar and just hanging out. You won't regret it.",

Follow up - manager called me, apologized and offered to send a gift card to visit again and give them a second chance. This was just to appease me, since card never arrived. I'll say it again: don't go there.",

The risotto was flavorful, but was a little undercooked for my liking. The potatoes were well seasoned, but were huge. It was basically a bowl of baked potatoes. I think they would've been better if they had been cut into smaller pieces.   We got seated right away late on a Friday night, but it was still very busy. I would definitely recommend a reservation here.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon Meat & Potatoes after arriving in Pittsburgh. I decided to take my chances and walk in without a reservation. They had over and hour wait - which I expected. The hostess did let me know that they had bar seating with full service. Their bar was also super packed, but I let the bartender know I was looking to grab a seat and ordered a drink in the meanwhile. As soon as someone was paying their check the bartender gave me a heads up and I was able to settle in.   I ordered a Bloody Mary because that's what I'm into these days. They have a DIY BM bar - first you choose your liquor and you get handed a glass, with a decent pour of said liquor. I went with chipotle pepper vodka, cause who doesn't love an extra kick. Then you head over to this assembly line where you dress your BM with different meats, cheeses and vegetables and then top off your liquor with the BM mix. I wish I was better at this whole dressing thing, but it is clearly not a strong point of mine. However, it was an experience and I was slightly buzzed after just one glass. It was STRONG.   Since I was there for brunch, I ordered the Brisket Hash. Everything about it was to die for. The eggs were properly poached, it had the right amount of truffle oil, and the potatoes were delicious. I wish the serving size was slightly bigger but it was still everything I wished it would be.   I would definitely come back to try out some more of their menu. If you are in Pittsburgh - this is a must.",

I had the fried pickles (best I've ever had), along with the wild boar sloppy joe w/ bbq chips. Everything was awesome. The True star of the show, however, was the grilled bread, which only cost $3! It came with an amazing butter and homemade strawberry jam and was absolutely perfect. My buddy had the fried chicken which came with biscuits and a coffee-bacon jam. He gave me a biscuit with the jam and it was off-the-charts good. This truly was one of the best lunches of my entire life. I'll definitely be back, the next time I'm in town.",

The Pittsburgh ranch chicken and waffles, the fried taters with truffle mayonnaise, and the banana peanut butter stuffed french toast were the highlight.  The chicken was so good but for once I found a waffle that was equally as good. It was fresh and a little firm like a waffle should be...not soft like a pancake. The fried taters are a good size and we split them among the 4 of us as an appetizer. The truffled mayonnaise was perfect. The stuffed french toast has malted peanuts on it that were soooo good. The french toast also had this crispy layer that was very delicious!   The Korean bbq burrito was underwhelming and missing the cheese and sour cream but the server took care of it immediately and it was removed from our bill. Our service from Riley was all around fantastic!",

    "text": "I really can't say enough about this place.    My girlfriend and I were passing through Pittsburgh on our way to my niece's wedding and managed to stumble into this place after hours.  We'd landed in Cleveland around 6 pm and didn't get to the Burgh until after 9:30.  We only wanted to dump our luggage at our hotel and find something cool/unique/local (non-fast-foody) to eat.  Later we'd find out that we'd gotten lucky.  Because it was so late, we were able to get a table as soon as we rambled in . . . .   Our order: fried pickles, poutine and the smoked, thick-cut (four bones) pork chop with house-made baked beans, spicy greens and a couple strips of charred/OMG/nom-nom-nom pork belly.  We've had fried pickles before and they were . . . I don't know . . . amusing?  A novelty?  These hit all the taste quadrants on the tongue--the thick cut of pickle is game-changing--and we could've eaten them by the dozen.  The poutine came with fresh, airy mozzarella and long-simmered, in-house gravy.  It was a meal unto itself.  And the pork chop?  Jesus.  It was gigantic but jaw-dropping: part ham (Christmas!), part porky chop (4th of July!). . . and all char, smoke and sauce.  I also have to say: the service was both casual and stellar.  Even at 10 pm, there were three friendly servers taking care of us all night.  Not a small thing.  We felt like we were at home--if home were a five-star restaurant.  So, even if we don't need to, we'll still toot the horn for this place.  We were visiting from Los Angeles, which isn't devoid of great, innovative (and even reasonably-priced) restaurants and food trucks.    But now we wish that we had this restaurant here . . . .",

Took the chance and showed up and to our delight they had plenty of availability.  We enjoyed Bone Marrow, Pigs Ears (very yummy) Salmon with black Rice and Pork Pappardelle.  All the food was delicious.  The menu is so interesting. I would take off 1/2 a star for the slowness of the service.  We sat for awhile before we ever met our server or received our drinks.  Never received a refill on water. Our server, who was very nice, had a very large party in a private room and I think it was difficult for her to handle it all.  The other thing I would share is that it is very dark.  Good for setting a mood - not so good for reading the menu.",

The dimmed lights and delicious mixed drinks are two of the reasons I'm cool with you. And the menu is as adventurous as my soul. There's always something new, different and borderline questionable on the menu so there's never a dull moment.   One big turnoff however is the tight quarters we diners and drinkers have to be in.  Although I put up with it, it's always awkward when I'm standing at the bar and my behind is bumping into the backs of diners' beautiful heads. Apologies are being given out as often as drinks are being poured.   With that being said, my favorite part is watching the show being performed behind the bar.  The bar tenders are True artists creating drinks worth writing home about. They are unique and delicious and I can never just get one. Well done!  So, Meat & Potatoes, although you're small inside and I have to endure more awkward moments in one night than anyone should in a year, I will be back.",

    "text": "My husband and I were very behind in trying Meat and Potatoes (so behind actually that we tried its newer sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye first), and we finally checked it out tonight before our Alton Brown Live show at the Benedum.  I had heard over and over again, particularly when Meat and Potatoes first opened, that the staff was underwhelming. Though they exceeded my extremely low expectations, I must admit that this restaurant receives 4 stars (and not 5) from me because of the staff that I encountered. The best analogy for me is to think of the sales associates (or should I say models) at Abercrombie. They will ring up your purchase, but they will not do it with a smile or go the extra mile. However, when I'm paying nearly $100 for a meal for two (drinks, appetizer, entrees, dessert, and tip), I expect my waiter to have a better personality than an A&F employee.  The second, but more minor, reason for my 4 star review is the seating. Though the restaurant is beautiful aesthetically, the made-for-2-people bench seat with accompanying miniature round table and chair is very teeny. This compact seating reminds me of restaurants in New York City and is not something that I want to experience in Pittsburgh. Plus, we were sitting a bit too close to a drunk woman ranting loudly to the strangers sitting immediately next to her about her ex-husband and his numerous infidelities and addiction issues.  However, despite these few flaws, I had a great dinner. We started with the Wild Mushroom Risotto appetizer. It was warm and rich and full of flavor. I would definitely order this dish again, though I do believe that it had a tad too much salt. For our main course, my husband ordered the Pot Roast, while I went with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast. The two bites of Pot Roast that I tried were very pleasing. The dish was homey and flavorful and appeared to be a great portion size. Overall, I enjoyed the Hudson Valley Duck Breast but did think that it had some opportunities for improvement. The little dandelion green salad on the plate seemed a bit unnecessary. However, it was descent tasting, particularly the pickled onions on top.  The sauerkraut pierogies on the dish were a major disappointment to me. They tasted pretty one-note and could have used some sort of sour cream sauce on top to improve the flavor. However, the star of the dish - the pastrami crusted duck - was perfection! The duck was cooked rare/medium rare (just the way that I like it) and perfectly seasoned. By the end of the meal, I was too full to finish and felt absolutely devastated to leave two slices of duck sitting on my plate.  We had allowed two hours for dinner before our show, so since we were finished in only 45 minutes, we decided to order a dessert. Though I'm sure the desserts change frequently, I do wish that the restaurant would print a small menu with the options. I had a tough time remembering all the options when the waiter listed them for me and also couldn't see the distant dessert sign on the wall. We selected the Baked Chocolate Mousse that was out-of-this-world delicious. I have to say that it was my favorite item of the evening, with the duck in a very close second.  Though I may have sounded critical throughout this review, especially since having the meal-of-my-life at Butcher and the Rye just a couple weeks ago, I do have to say that I enjoyed my first Meat and Potatoes experience, and it definitely won't be my last.",

    "text": "This place solidified my desire to relocate to Pittsburgh. Yes, it's that good.  My boyfriend and I were considering moving to the Steel City after reading some impressive articles about the area. We were stumbling around downtown Pittsburgh in an uncomfortable rain/wind/ohgreatnowmyumbrellaisinverted situation and this place was a beacon of hope!   Considering how busy it was, we didn't have to wait long at all-- no more than 20 minutes and they have a really comfortable, intimate seating area while you're waiting for a table to open up. We ended up in a great conversation with a friendly local and the time flew by.   Once we were seated we could see why this establishment has such rave reviews. The staff is amazing. My boyfriend and I couldn't help remarking on how kind and helpful *every* employee was. There was none of that ~avoid eye contact so you don't have to answer a question~ on the part of the employees. Providence has some great, independent restaurants but I often get the impression that I'm burdening the staff by asking for anything extra...even water. While every establishment we visited in our two and a half days in Pittsburgh featured unusually kind (by New England standards), Meat and Potatoes truly stood out.  Oh, yeah, and the meal was phenomenal. I'm not a \"~*~foodie~*~*,\" but I'd like to think I haven't completely destroyed my palette by overindulging in packaged Ramen. This is some of the best food I've ever had. We started off with the lobster macaroni and cheese and we stopped and looked at each other...we may have even been salivating. This was beyond good. It was rich and hearty and while the portion was appetizer sized, it could easily be a meal in itself because of its density and richness. I don't even like crustaceans!  For our main dishes, my boyfriend had the mussels and chose the curry sauce (they had two other options but they escape me :/) and I had the pork belly tacos. For nearly our whole meal we kept nodding and eating, staring wide-eyed at each other in contentment. I didn't sample any of his dish but he tried some of mine and we can both vouch for its deliciousness. The sesame seed crema was the perfect addition. Again, this meal was very rich (no complaints here) so come hungry.  It's rare that I write a review anymore but the service at Meat and Potatoes (as amazing as the food was) compelled me to. Our first impression of Pittsburgh was a great one and we look forward to making Meat and Potatoes our spot in the coming months.",

Brisket Mac and cheese is another ridiculous option.. Delicate smoke, blue cheese creaminess with a BBQ chip crunch.   Prices are totally reasonable for the quality and portions of the food.

Meat and Potatoes did not disappoint! We made reservations a week or so in advance for a Saturday night.  It was very busy but we did not have to wait for our table.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  They congratulated us on our anniversary.  We asked questions about different dishes on the menu and they provided us with some excellent recommendations. We both one of the specials which was a delicious chicken dish.  We were also surprised by a bottle of wine from a Canadian winery that we love that friends of ours had left at the restaurant.  The fact that they did that for us and served it as a surprise speaks volumes to the kind of people that run the restaurant.  It was a bit crowded in the dining room. You are right next to the tables next to you so you cannot really have private conversations.  (I also feel for the waitstaff who have to make their way around everyone and everything with trays). I only docked points for the crowded feel and the noise. We will be back to try the other amazing dishes on the menu.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Meat & Potatoes for both Brunch & Dinner. The restaurant serves delicious meals, great drinks and a friendly wait staff.   The restaurant can get extremely busy, especially before a show in one of the nearby theaters. I would definitely recommend booking a reservation in advance, as you will not get seated without one during busy hours.   The restaurant has a dark atmosphere and a few of the tables are very close together, making it difficult to hold a conversation with all of the noise. I have found that it is better to eat at Meat & Potatoes will a group of friends or family, as you will get seated on the side of the restaurant that is less crowded.   Further, the restaurant has a private party room that can accommodate a large group of people for any event.   Overall, I would recommend Meat & Potatoes to anyone! It is a great place for a post-work drink, a pre-show dinner or a Sunday morning brunch.",

We also felt it was way overpriced and the service was terrible.  From the oh so enjoyable room temperature water, to the appetizer order not being placed, then when we did get it finally, the appetizer plates were never removed, and when the dinner came, it was served on a wooden slab and we were not given plates to use. I had to reach over the app plates to even get to the wooden slab. So messy.  The salt content left me feeling sickly.  We will not be back.  The stars I did award were for the drinks, which were refreshing. This restaurant really has a reputation of serving delicious food, guess things have definitely changed after a couple of successful years.",

There was no wait, as I made a last-minute reservation for right when they opened.   The interior threw me off a bit - it's very plush, to say the least. I wasn't expecting it, especially since they share bathrooms with the theater, and they're more, um, pedestrian.   Cocktails were good. I had the Cane and Able (10 cane rum, Ardbeg 10 yr, lemon, vanilla, jalapeno, angostura). I was afraid it would be too busy, but it was pretty well-balanced. The soft vanilla and smoke from the Scotch really rounded off the peppery edges.   As for food, it was mostly good. The fried pickles and poutine were solid. I had the pot roast, which was very tender and flavorful, and went well with the whipped potatoes and veggies. My friend got their take on the Fish and Chips (country fried skate with yukon gold chips, malt vinegar aioli, mushy peas and pickled green tomatoes). It was an overwhelming mess. All the components were done really well, but the flavor combinations seemed very disjoined and overworked. Just too much.   We opted for dessert elsewhere, so I can't comment on that.   Overall, a good experience.",

Though the food was good, the wait staff need to learn some professionalism and patience.  They also need to learn that their menu is not very common and not everyone is expected to understand what certain things mean on it.   I think the manager needs to have a talk with the wait staff taking orders, most of whom seemed to exclusively young females (while all the bus people were males).",

    "text": "Things are looking up in Pittsburgh with the addition of this creative and brilliantly thoughtful restaurant.  This place can be and most likely will be a diet buster but is well worth the splurge every now and again.  I really enjoyed the service and ambiance.  I loved the cushy chairs and could easily have stayed for hours.  Miriam and I split some dishes and each ordered a Caesar salad.  This was a Caesar unlike I have ever experienced and was the best one I have ever had.  From the menu: romaine/ kale / house dressing / crispy pig ears / chicharrones / fried egg / pickled green tomatoes $10.  Oh my gosh.  It was rich and flavorful, the mix of textures was terrific.  The green tomatoes and tangy dressing giving relief to the richness of the chicharrones, pig ears and egg.  I am craving one right now.  We split the buttermilk fried chicken livers with what I believe was a mustard based dipping sauce.  Perfectly battered, fried, the livers were cooked medium.  These were as good as the reviews state and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again and again.  I think there were 8 so I would definitely split them unless your going to make a meal of them at the bar with a drink.  That may just be an idea!    We also split the Ahi Taquitos $14 with ponzu / avocado / jalapenos / ahi amarillo.  Crispy and absolutely wonderful.  I wish they were a little bigger because they were gone in too few bites.  These are very dainty but have huge flavor and a great balance of ingredients.  They're a little on the spicy side but not so much as to be overboard.    Lastly we split the special for the evening.   Braised pork belly with mole, corn on the cob, pickled cabbage, jalapenos and radish.  I loved this.  Loved it!  This should definitely stay on the menu.  The pork was cooked perfectly, it was tender, unctuous fatty dream.  The mole was terrific and I really enjoyed the 4 inch corn on the cobs.  I can't pinpoint the seasoning but I wanted more.    Our 5 dishes were $60 with tax and I really didn't mind a bit.  The quality and brilliance of the food was well worth it and I am excited to give a 5 star review to a Pittsburgh restaurant.  Keep up the good work!  I will be back to try more of this brilliant and interesting menu.",

When she deigned to put her petulant eyes on us, she actually scowled at me... Gee, I had the concierge at our 5 star hotel make this reservation (against his advice), as I had read positive yelp reviews about the place. But this individual was truly pissed that we were there, and before long, so was I... The \"restaurant\" was understandably 3/4 empty but the \"hostess\" insisted on seating us on top of another table... Our gracious neighbors insisted that it was \"OK\", if we sat down (practically in their laps) but I explained that we were from out of town and weren't comfortable with banquet seating. Our little snot of a hostess then said we that we \"could sit there or nowhere\", even though there were a ton of empty tables! What? Really??? That was when I noticed the smell in this \"eatery\"! It was an unholy cross between disinfectant, manure and offal...Usually when Satan manifests in the flesh he is accompanied by a strong fecal odor, so I instantly knew that we were in the wrong place and urgently needed to flee... I made the sign of the cross at this vile little creature as we slowly backed up and headed for the door. After running for our lives down the street, we ended up at a wonderful little Italian place where we enjoyed a magnificent meal. Like I said, we're from out of town and should have listened to our concierge who had warned us to avoid, \"Meat and Potatoes like the plague\"! I should have listened... My bad!!!",

    "text": "Living in New York, I have really high expectations for food (especially brunch). So far I've been disappointed by a lot of places I've tried in Pittsburgh. Given all the great reviews, I decided to try out M&P for brunch, keeping expectations low.  We didn't have reservations on Sunday, so we showed up exactly at 10:30am when the restaurant opens. 4 groups were already ahead of us waiting for seats at the bar. Tables were not available for walk-ins. The waiting area was dimly lit with ample seating which was great! Fortunately there were plenty of seats at the bar so we only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Honestly, I think I prefer to sit at the bar - the bar table is quite spacious, there's a place to hang my bag, and there's much more excitement going on at the bar.  The food was really hit or miss.   Brisket and egg (1/5): Super disappointed. This dish got such rave reviews on Yelp. I was expecting a Korean BBQ flavor but it was completely lacking in the brisket. The burnt edges were super dry and chewy. The brisket otherwise was so fatty both my bf and I had to spit out the fat. My bf liked the kimchi which was mixed with gochujang (I absolutely love gochujang!). It was extremely spicy so be sure you can handle it. The egg yolk was almost completely cooked and barely runny.  Grilled bread (1/5): First, my bread was burnt and dry. Second, the raspberry jam was way too sweet. I've had the best fresh jam in NY (Beth's Farm Kitchen jam), and this jam at M&P tasted like Smucker's compared to that.   Fried taters (3/5): The fries were really good, however the seasoned fries at Winghart's are much, much better. Also it seemed like our fries were from the bottom of the bag, meaning they were all short instead of the long strings you see in the photos. These fries should've never been served.  French toast (4/5): Now here's the saving grace. I am extremely picky about my french toast. I like it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside without being too eggy. I've had the best french toast of my life at ABC Kitchen and have tried it at a myriad of other restaurants in NYC. I've even been disappointed in some of the highly rated french toast dishes in NY. The french toast at M&P is absolutely delicious. It beats the banana french toast at Extra Virgin in the West Village, NY by a mile. I don't even like banana but it is delicious here. The portion is humongous. The sourdough is exquisitely caramelized on the outside and chewy on the inside (but not fluffy). The bacon almond brittle is a bonus, but I barely touched it because the french toast stands on its own. Definitely, definitely recommend this.  Regarding drinks, my bellini was also ok, but my boyfriend's diet Coke was flat!   Overall, I would definitely come back for the french toast and to try the chicken and waffles. I might even try dinner but not expect too much.",

Both times phenomenal service and incredible food. They have a back room that's quieter that you can reserve (or rent out? I'm not sure - someone else was paying). The third time I came with my parents for my medical school graduation a few weeks ago. My parents are notoriously impossible to please when it comes to restaurants. I've never seen them get beyond a \"I guess this place is ok\" sentiment. But Meat & Potatoes seriously won them over. My dad was in love with the beer menu (\"tins\" only), my sister was in love with the historic cocktails, even my mother was thrilled by her food (never happens).  The vibe is cool, the menu is incredible, the quality is great, and the prices are totally reasonable for what you're getting. I wish I could afford to eat here every day.  The devils on horseback - laced with crack, I swear. And I thought I hated dates.  The cocktails - I've tried half the menu by now, all amazing.  My one teensy tiny bit of constructive criticism, just for the sake of not glowing too much - make sure you don't get a table immediately next to the bar if possible. They're placed pretty close and if the bar gets crowded (it's right in the middle of the dining room), sometimes other patrons will invade your space. We actually asked them not so seat us at a table that was already invaded. They obliged, and then we watched 3 other families also refuse the table. I did feel a little sorry for the poor souls who eventually ended up at it. But not that sorry, because the food and the drink and the awesomeness would have made it worth a little discomfort anyway.",

First the environment and decor is between rustic and modern and it almost felt like it was between divey and trendy/nice without it feeling disgusting. I think the reason why it felt divey was because of the half oval bar in the middle of the restaurant, where it seemed very \"college-y\" with people hanging around or draping themselves all over it.  They have an insanely extensive whiskey menu, which basically won me over at that point! My table shared an order of the fried pickles as an appetizer, and I got the Red Snapper. It's a bit on the lighter side, which is what I wanted, with a lot of veggies, and the fish was cooked so well. Next time, I want to try the Pork Chop. The table next to mine had a few people that ordered it and it was huge... huge. It looked really good.  Their seasonal menu also sounded really good and I'm sure it was! We also got 2 desserts, which I believe were also on rotation. One was a pb oreo dirt pot, and the other was a malted chocolate pot de creme... and the pot de creme was to die for. It is definitely one of the best restaurant desserts I've ever had!",

Drinks are not the average bottle slinging. Anything off the menu is an experience though the special was too smokey like eating a piece of wood out of the fire. However no uppity BS, she took it back and made me another.   Had the special which was the chacatuire as an app with the fried Brussel sprouts. Both were outstanding. For main course we had the special strip which was also fantastic. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the waygu was way too fatty and not well seasoned. Dessert was phenomenal. Chocolate pecan pie and the chocolate mousse. Both of them were so good we nearly ordered another.   This place consistently delivers a great dining experience. Karen was a great waitress as well. My friend from Cincinnati repeatedly said they had nothing like it there. Props to the burgh and to meat and potatoes for bringing big city dining to our beautiful city.",

    "text": "I went to Meat and Potatoes for a friends birthday dinner. We made reservations far in advance, so that was not an issue. However, it is connected to one of the theaters so it is frequently packed with the show crowd.   The ambience of the restauarant is really nice, it is a bit dark and small inside but is very cozy. I thought it would be a really good date place. It also has outside seating, but it was cold when we went so we did not have a chance to check that out.   As my drink, I got the bourbon smash which has bourbon crushed with mint leaves and berries and oh my god is it delicious. I have tried numerous times to create it myself at home with some bulleit bourbon, mint, berries and simple syrup but I have never been able to recreate it perfectly.   We got the bone marrow as an appetizer. I thought the presentation was really nice, the bone itself came out and had small dishes with sea salt, capers, and some other type of spice. It was presented with delicious toasty bread. While I was not a huge fan of the bone marrow itself, it went on the bread like butter and what really made it stand out was the garnishes to put on it.  For my entree I got the duck. It was presented in slices, and almost looked like steak. I ordered it medium rare and it was really delicious. My friend had the turducken special, and while I could not stop giggling at the concept/name, it was a really good special too.",

    "text": "What a great spot! Long weekend in Pittsburgh, and I was told this was a spot to try, so the group I was with came here for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't overly crowded, which was nice, they were playing amazing hits from the 90s and the sun was shining through the big windows at the front of the restaurant. Meat and Potatoes doesn't want to come off pretentious, hence the name and they succeeded. Just served great food and great drinks. I had to get the chicken and waffles because they were too good to pass up, and had a rosemary infused vodka cocktail with some champagne! Delicious. Serving size was large and in charge, my friend and I could have split the chicken and waffles easily and all other meals at the table were the same. No complaints! Definitely recommend it for one meal while visiting Pittsburgh.",

The texture and presentation were fantastic.  Overall, I was very impressed. They also had good happy hour beer specials with most beers being $3. I will definitely be going back at some point.",

After learning that nearby restaurants closed early due to water issues, we quickly noticed that they were still open and decided to partake. We were welcomed and guaranteed a spot without reservation (points added for that)! The waitress was very pleasant and friendly. We ordered our drinks and browsed the extensive menu full of gastropub favorites! I had to order the mac n cheese! So yummy! I also ordered the wings and they were also very tasty!   I can't wait to dine here again and try their brisket. Definitely 5+ stars!!!",

    "text": "Lot of good things to say about M&P and a few less good too - so I'll do a pro and con, for a chance. But overall a very very good place downtown!  Pros: the restaurant is very nice, with a great oval bar at the center, and tables around. Very high ceiling, great rusty colors, a bit shadowy. I like it.   Cocktails! I tried a few that night, and I liked all of them (some more than others). In fact, these may be the best cocktails i have had in Pittsburgh so far.  Food! The bone marrows are as impressive as the other reviews say. Huge. No HUGE, and tasty. Not for the faint of hear though: that's not light on your belly. The duck was fantastic and so was the flat iron. The tartare was good, although I have had better in Pittsburgh (Salt's is often better for instance).   The portions are fit for Pittsburgh. Enormous. too much actually (do we need to have 3 enormous bones for the bone marrow?), but I suppose some would grumble on yelp if they were a tiny bit smaller. Yinzers have a big stomach.   The menu is not very large, and is fairly conservative (steaks, duck, salmon) with a few sandwiches. But it all seems very good.   Cons: the tables are really close to each other if you are dining in the section with tables for 2. You may hear your neighbors, and this may be less than exciting. At 8:30 a Tuesday, we did not have the problem. The tables emptied soon after we arrived. Good strategy.  The wine we tried (a malbec from argentina) was less than impressive. We did not finish it. Worth a star off? nope. The pros make up for it.   The coffee was god awful - what's wrong M&P? And there is no espresso. Really? Like in 2014, in a fancy restaurant?   Oh yeah and it's hard to get a table over the week end. Booking is required. The bar is also quite full over the week end.   We'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "The ambiance at Meat & Potatoes is 5 stars.  It's unique without taking that so far as to make people uncomfortable. It's warm and bright and dark and cozy all at once with captivating light fixtures, various size tables and tufted chairs.  It's more special and sparkly than a home, but it's not stiff or formal.  The menu isn't overly broad but there's something for everyone.  And the presentation?  Impressive.  The Pork for instance, looked like a polished version of something that would've been served to the Flinstones.  Huge and glossy with homestyle fixins.  It tasted good, but it didn't quite live up to its looks.  The Pork was tasty but slightly (and I mean slightly) chewy and the greens had a vinegar note that didn't quite blend with the rest of the dish and the beans were (nicely) more interesting than one would expect for baked beans, but they were quite firm for beans in a way I'd consider undercooked.  I rarely indulge in french fries, and I'm pleased to say, these ones were well worth the splurge.  Crispy without being burnt, nicely salted, and the large portion is.... well, large.  We ordered another entree, but the presentation of the pork so overshadowed it, I can't even remember what it was!  In the end, the star of the show was the Fried Brussels.  Seemingly a staple at hipster joints nationwide, one could rue the unoriginal dish in place of something more locally inspired, but... Yum.   So crispy and dusted with parmesan and the aioli.  Thank you, Meat & Potatoes, for keeping it simple, simple, simple.  I had a child with me who declared they would eat brussels every meal if I could recreate the dish.    It was an enjoyable meal that didn't blow me away, apart from the brussels (which, I was able to recreate, sans the aioli, at home with a shocking amount of oil.).    The wait staff was pleasant though a little scattered... Rushing away forgetting that we wanted to order dessert (good but nothing to write home about) and in the end, after we asked them to package an entire leftover flatbread that went uneaten, they never brought it out.  We could have asked a third time, but headed home without it.",

    "text": "March 7, 2014. Decided Meat & Potatoes was the place for us to have a birthday celebration dinner. We arrived a tad early for our 7:45 reservation. We were pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away despite the place being packed with theater going crowd. We were only a group of two, lol.   Waiter poured some water right away & took our drink order. Our bottle of wine took some time to arrive. But the place was packed & the staff was constantly moving.   We ordered some fried pickles for fun but I can tell you the menu is packed with an array of appetizers, drinks & mussels of the day! Pickles were delicious & the dipping sauce had a lovely zing to it.   We were seated in the bar area at these tiny two people tables among others coming & going. After an extraordinarily long wait & noticing people coming in after us were getting their meals we were about to ask about our meals when the waiter came to us & told us he took it upon himself to involve his manager & insist on our meals to be made immediately. He apologized. We were fine with that result but if we had theater tickets or other plans we would have been hard press to have stayed & been able to enjoy our meals. I think the wine helped in this situation not to get annoyed.   The best part of the night other then the amazing chocolate dessert & having dinner with my great friend was the lovely friendly couple next to us. The tables are so close together it's impossible not to acknowledge your dinner mates. That made the evening fun & extra special to meet friendly native Pittsburghians!   Note: I enjoyed the game hen with green bean casserole & a scrumptious cranberry stuffing & lovely chicken gravy. The chicken was moist & nicely seasoned. Wish there was a roll or fresh bread to sop up all that gravy!   My friend enjoyed the fish & chips. Lightly battered. Served with fresh greens & smashed peas (my friend absolutely went nuts over the smashed peas & wish she had a small bowl of them) all drizzled with a light malt vinegar. There was a side of their home made tarter sauce.   We shared an amazing chocolate mousse dessert with fresh whipped cream!   All in all we had a nice experience. It was loud & very active. Not a place for a romantic dinner for two but definitely a place to go with friends. If going on theater night allow plenty of time to enjoy your meal or eat at home & enjoy drinks & appetizers or dessert here. Food is delicious & plenty. I didn't pay since it was my birthday but my friend was pleasantly surprised at the bill thinking it would be higher with the quality of food. She would put it at moderately priced to high depending on what you ordered. I would agree with her based on the prices. You can eat well here and spend little or spend a lot.   I say go. Give it a try & decide for yourself!  :-)",

It tasted great, don't get me wrong, but the ratio of gravy/cheese curds/fries seemed off. I still enjoyed it though. The salty pig flatbread was very good as well. Our waiter mistakenly gave me cold coffee after our meal but noticed the error before giving it to me and replaced it immediately. All of the food here is hearty and there is so much of it you'll probably end up boxing your leftovers to bring home.",

Our waiter was horrible, literally never came back and he would get a drink for one end of the table and not come check on the other. When we got food he never once came to check on us. It took initially 30 mins to get him to take our order. So with one couple ordering the steak for two... We were told it would take 45-50mins... It took over an hr and half! Again it wasn't busy. First, they should tell you about that when you sit down. One girls hamburger get was over cooked and gave her a hard time when she asked to add bacon to it, my pot roast was overlooked and the gravy tasted funny, the devil on horseback was served cold and the waygu was dripping with butter or oil... Was horrible. For the cost it was horrible overall. To have a reservation at 7:30 not get your food till after 9 is an issue. Super disappointed because it's usually so good.",

My group came in late-ish on a Saturday night ready to ravage some of that Canadian delicacy, plus whatever else we could get our mitts on. Overall, the kitchen is sending out some pretty amazing food, but there are some kinks to iron out. Service seemed a little frazzled and slow; one friend's burger was underdone (not sure if that was the kitchen or our server's fault); and the crab banh mi was more like a crab po' boy, and a little light on the crab. Otherwise, we were really happy with our food. The poutine disappeared in a heartbeat, my ricotta gnocchi were the fluffiest and tastiest I've ever had, and another friend's chicken wings were very flavorful. Prices are right, and the French bistro atmosphere is proper. I am definitely willing to tack on a fifth star if they deal with the  hiccups.",

They basically said when asked they would get us right in if we were but put us on a waiting list which was going to be 40 minutes. We went in to wait by the bar and saw five empty tables. Ashley who took our name, came in five minutes later and basically told us there were OTHER PLACES IN TOWN to eat.  What the f?..  After back and forth, she pulled one of the five empty tables out of her a$$ and miracously got us a table. Service still sucked as our waiter rich could care less about getting us drinks let alone dinner.

First, the menu is extremely limited.  Second, we ordered the gnocci and the pork.  The gnocci was mushy and soggy.  It was not very flavorful.  The best part of the pasta dish was the garlic toast.  We also ordered the pork.  It was fatty and tough.  It is served with an apple slaw that has a strange mixture of flavors - not very good.  The menu indicates that the meal comes with baked beans.  In reality, it is just a spoonful of beans on top of the pork.  The beans were the best part of the meal, so it was disappointing that there wasn't really even one serving on the plate.

    "text": "I ate at this restaurant once for lunch and once for dinner. I greatly enjoyed my food both times. The lunch menu currently consists of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees such as chicken, pork, and rigatoni. The dinner menu has some more options such as burgers, flat breads, duck, steak, and salmon. The restaurant is not a large space and does get packed with people, so I sat cozily next to strangers during lunch, but I had a little more space when I was seated in the second dining room for dinner. Service from the waiter for lunch was very good. Service for dinner was very slow. I had to wait over an hour for my entree to come out. Price was moderate for lunch. For dinner we spent $120 for two people without drinks. I would recommend the delicious Wagyu Flat Iron that I ate for dinner, although the carrots that accompanied it were overly burned. Dressing casually is OK.",

I just went with my husband and they put us on the wall in between other couples. I felt like I could brush legs with the people on either side of me and definitely knew everything that the other couples were talking about. We did go on a Sunday and I understand that he restaurant is located near theaters but I definitely felt rushed. I think that we were in and out of there in about an hour with 2 appetizers, two entrees, drinks and dessert. Personally, if I am going to spend money like we did that night, I would prefer to have a nice leisurely dinner.   We ordered the fried Brussels which were good but you also need to expect a somewhat burnt flabor. We had the ahi taquitos which were quite small but not bad. For dinner I had the pork belly tacos. Some were much more fatty than others but still decent and my husband had some sort of steak option. He was extremely happy with his meal while I still think that I have had better.   I would recommend this to someone who is going to a play but even then, we had reservations and sat outside in the waiting area for over half an hour to not be comped anything. Even if we didn't get anything comped, you would think that they would have at least acknowledged how long the wait was.",

Honestly, I can't think of one bad thing about this establishment as of yet. The look and feel of the restaurant is very modern and classic at the same time.  Their cocktails are inspiring and delicious. I went with the Gin Richard which consists of superb quality Blue Coat Gin, lime, lemon, soda, and some delightful rosemary that really accentuates the drink. My friend had the Old Canadian, which is by far the best bourbon concoction I've ever tasted, and not to mention gorgeous to look at and hold in your hand. It's almost a crime to consume these beverages. It's as if God himself wanted all of the Meat and Potatoes patrons to observe their beautiful and luscious nature.  Food wise, I delved upon the Bone Marrow appetizer, having never tried bone marrow before, and I must say that  I was in awe of its simplistic presentation. Three huge pieces of bone marrow, some delicious, baked break, and some tasty spices, such as capers, to add to the overall taste and experience.   I loved Meat and Potatoes and can't wait to go back. Do yourself a favor and go.",

But the meal I decided on was really delicious, a pasta meal. The atmosphere was OK, I was in a low table near the bar and next to the Whiskey Cabinet. The manager even asked us to hold a bottle of whiskey while he unlocked and re-locked the cabinet. The bar was filled with rude business men cat calling the waitress. Not very classy for the cost. I wouldn't go back by choice.",

    "text": "Was very much looking forward to dining at M&P after recently seeing it on I believe it was The Food Network. Happened to be in town for the Trans Siberian Orchestra concert (wonderful experience) so thought to give it a try. Reservations were for 5:30, arrived at evening opening and was seated almost immediately when they opened at 5. Provided menu and service items by a nicely interactive wait staff member. We already knew what we wanted so was able to order fairly quickly. We started with fried pickles, and for the main course ordered the $75 steak for two along with rosemary potatoes and roasted cauliflower. The waitress did warn that the size of the meat would take 45 minutes to cook which we understood and still would have plenty of time to make it to the concert. The pickles arrived very rapidly. They were okay, thickly breaded and thick cut pickles but flavor was a bit lacking (primanti brothers and Buffalo Wild Wings both do fried pickles much better). And now the wait...  Meat was horribly under cooked.  Instead of medium as ordered it arrived blue rare at best.  It was so full of myoglobin it was like it was just sliced off the animal.  After getting the waitresses attention, they offered to take it back to finish cooking, this took another 15 or so minutes and now the potatoes were cold, sadly as they were great before that.  The amount of blood and gore with the first presentation pretty much destroyed our appetites.  The waitress had the manager comp the sides.  With this experience, I can't and won't recommend the restaurant, if you do brave it, don't order this meal unless you have vampiric appetites.",

A friend introduced us to this place and he was good friends with the owner/chef and we were able to try so many delicious dishes on their menu. The staff were amazing and super friendly (on other occasions that we've been here without our friend).   We went here for many different occasions - birthdays, new years eve, just random dinner and brunch events.   Reservations are a MUST - this place is getting hot off the charts. You can reserve the front room and a nice back room for FREE and they are great with accommodating your needs. Special events - they have specials all the time - try them - you won't be disappointed.   Their food is amazing. I love almost everything on their menu - the pub burger, the bacon wrapped dates, fries, porkchops, flat bread.. brunch is great too - chick and waffles - oh the list goes on! Food taste is rich so if you want it a little lighter - just ask! They catered to my mom (who's vegan) and quality was not anything below 5 stars! Their portions are BIG too.  Four stars - would be the servers. I love the chef, the owner (one and the same), the manager who walks around and the bartenders. The waitresses need to work on their skills a little more. Sometimes they forget you and don't pay attention to your needs.  Overall - try this place and make it your next spot!",

All of this is great, but secondary to the food, which is simply incredible.  Unique snack and starters including great fried pickles Mac n cheese, fried brusselsprouts.  Salads are amazing including one I had last night which was a mixed light greens, watermelon, jalapeno peppers, radish and a light citrus dressing.  Burgers are awesome, had a special pulled pork taco with slaw, pickled cucumbers and cilantro.  Amazing!  The fish entrees are great, and they have a bone in ribeye for two along with potato wedges that are a work of art.  I haven't had that yet, but have seen it served many times.  People seem very pleased.  This is will be a go to spot for me every time I am visiting Pitt..  One of the more hip & trendy places I have been to...  Highly recommended...

I had the roast beef which was excellent; my friend ordered the mac and cheese appetizer (too rich and quite unlike mac and cheese in a bad way) and the mushroom risotto (excellent); though we both knew that the restaurant is famous for its \"meat and potatoes\", we were hoping to have ice cream for dessert - or at least more than a meager choice of 3 options.  I settled on the chocolate mousse which was small, but delicious - nice and rich - I wish there had been more; my friend had a strawberry layered cheesecake dessert which she found delicious as well - just wanted more!... All and all, I recommend M &P - good food; nice quantity (except desserts); great service; great ambiance - would definitely make reservations a few day before hand if you can.",

    "text": "See my review for Tako.  Again, this crew does three things right each time: Ambience (their best feature, and to be honest much needed in this beautiful city), bold flavors (hence this review), and a good blend of inherent Pittsburgh with outside flavors. Oh and a fourth: Some of the best drinks I have had, PERIOD.  Now, hailing from NYC and being a child of the world, I think my palette has evolved to the point where gut feelings mean more than just Borbyrigmi (that's what Google is here for people)...but now food gives me that instant gratification and \"light bulb.\"  Before I proceed, I will say this. They have the best burger I have had in Pittsburgh, period (yes, it even beat you Tessaro's). More on that later.  Now, none of the above makes me any more special than the next person to judge food, but I think my take is authentic. With Tako, they did it well. With Butcher, they did well for what it is supposed to be.  I wish I could say the same for M&P. Why the 3 stars? Consistency man, consistency. My first experience was fantastic. Meat and Potatoes for two and good lord I wanted another round but I couldn't keep dessert waiting. My second time there, the meat was slightly dry, less juicy, and the potatoes weren't well seasoned and I just couldn't stand it. The Brussels were delicious, the tots were seasoned well, but good god that meat and potatoes the second time around really irked me.  So visit three was brunch and I have to say it does live up to the hype. The brunch was muito bom as they say in Portuguese, I had the Pub Burger and I have to say this is one of the best burgers I have had in my entire life as well as in Pittsburgh. The pastrami belly was just cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The bun was perfect and the horseradish cheddar complimented the entire burger perfectly. The fried egg was perfect and thank you chef for keeping that yolk runny like my nose as I write this - unrelenting (gross, I know).  I tried my friends' Grilled Cheese and it was delicious and next time I will be trying the Brisket Hash because it was just delightful.   The bloody mary bar was as good as any other bloody mary bar you can find around town. I specifically ordered the Quarterdeck and it was very good. The folks that own these establishments really make excellent drinks.  Finally, I went back again for dinner and Ordered the Wagyu flatiron and...not bad. Not fantastic, but with such a fine cut of meat I expected more. Just a bit dry for my taste. My sister's pappardelle however, was perfect and that pork shoulder fell apart in my mouth and I wish I had ordered that. Though simple, they really toasted that garlic bread really well and I don't know what it was but there was a slight non-garlicy zing to the bread or maybe just herbal butter or something..but it was great!  As you can see the waves of consistency truly have a great impact on this review and hence the 3 stars.   Overall, beautiful atmosphere, perfect for dates and gatherings, good for what it is (gastropub with old world style decor), fantastic drinks, but food needs more consistency and can be hit or miss. Service is great!",

After Mike came to me on the rocks I should have seen it as the first sign something was up.   I came here on Friday for lunch and was a bit disappointed. I heard such great things, but unfortunately there were several issues. The Manhattan isn't a big deal but the wait time for our beers was a joke. It wasn't packed. The bartender wasn't busy. It was slow service. I was waiting forever.   So the drink was a little bit of a drag, the service wasn't the best, at least the food was going to be amazing right? Ehhh. My salmon bibimbap was excellent. I can't front there. The chicken sandwich though was underwhelming. The Mac and cheese was alright. And the fried pickles were below average.   I came here thinking this would be the one meal we got in Pittsburgh that cost a little more than anything else. It's a fairly inexpensive city compared to New York. Wish we spent our money elsewhere.",

We were seated at the large center bar (this seemed to be the place to be with smaller tables on the outside encircling the bar as another dining option). The bartenders were very friendly and provided great recommendations. The food was tasty and the sandwiches were very reasonably priced. I really enjoyed the pub burger, a massive burger topped with pork belly and egg, that was extremely filling and a great price at $14. The cocktails were also tasty as they provide their own bourbon in their Manhattans. This seemed to be a popular place for tourists and locals alike (lots of people here coming from the Steelers game).  We'd certainly come back here during our next visit to Pittsburgh.",

The hubby got the pork chop with beans and greens, very flavorful,  and such big portion! Was a younger crowd this night, and only draw back was the tables very close, so heard other conversations.

It was also my SO's b-day and thought it would be something he'd like.  The service was not good, expected much more from a higher-end establishment.  We had to wait on drinks, they got the order wrong once and the waitress spilled a drink on my SO without realizing she was doing it.  She kept handing drinks across the table rather than walking around to the person and dripping everywhere - this is amateur.  They did this with the food as well but managed not to spill anything.  The tables were too small for a party of four and/or the choice of serving dishes are too big/awkward.  We ordered the bone marrow and the steak tartar and it was a terrible experience.  We couldn't have the two serving dishes along with our personal dishes on the table very easily and someone nearly knocked it off the table.  I saw other tables around us experiencing this difficulty as well. As far as the food itself, the steak tartar was very good but was not impressed with the bone marrow - seemed gimmicky to me.  A lot of work and greasy mess to spread a small amount fatty marrow on one piece of bread.   I don't even remember what I had for dinner - so I think that says something.  The prices were outrageous as well.  Just do not understand what the appeal is.",

There is a comfortable seating lounge in front of the main dining area with a coat rack.  Their decor is both classy and hip (business casual to dressy attire yet Top 40 music playing).  Tables are placed very close to each other so it's uncomfortably easy to hear your neighbor's conversation.  We shared the Meat & Potatoes for Two ($69), which included their famous bone marrow and steak.  Our waiter informed us that the wait for that entree averages around 30 minutes but could be up to an hour on a busy night!  We ordered appetizers and drinks while we waited.  My friend loved the fried pickles and fried brussels sprouts but I wasn't a fan of either small plates.  Our M&P for 2 finally arrived (thankfully did not take an hour).  The 34 oz ribeye steak was HUGE and cooked until it was pink to medium, which is how I like my steak.  The bone marrow gratin was very rich, almost like eating liquid butter but with a perfectly spiced crunch.  We were so stuffed that we had to box some of the steak and the potatoes.  It was more than enough food for two people.",

The menu does change, so it can be a different scenario from one time to another, but it's sometimes a difficult place to commit to going to if you are not in the mood for a heavy meal.

The restaurant aesthetics were great and feels like a giant restaurant even though it isn't a huge space. Definitely a comfortable environment. The food was great. No complaints there. My only issue is with the cocky types of bartenders who are always trying to impose their weird creations on me. It's getting pretty old and it happened here. When someone very directly orders a classic drink just go with it. But I ended up with a drink that was based off of what I ordered but only it incorporated a couple ingredients with very overpowering and distinct flavors. Especially ones that might be off putting or are far away from what someone initially ordered.  Maybe I'm picky? But instead of trying to show off your creation maybe ease into it and ask some questions first about what someone likes. Don't just say \"trust me\" and not tell someone what you're planning on doing. I don't need surprises. Just the correct expectations for what I am ordering.",

    "text": "Wandering down the street a few hours before our show, two friends of mine and I decide to try to get into this place on a Friday night with no reservations. Walking in carefully, my friend nervously goes up to the hostess stand and asks \"how stupid is it to try and get a table for three with no reservation?\". Smiling, the host said we could either sit outside on the patio (plenty of seats because there was a slight chill in the air) or he could find three seats at the bar for us. We took a chance and chose the table, and were seated promptly.   The service was a little slow to start with, but quickly learned that our server had a zillion other tables and was taking care of the whole patio, which filled quickly with other diners willing to take a chance in chilly air. She was very helpful with suggestions, and ultimately our group ended up with a few apps, some flatbreads and an entree. I'll break them all down by below.  Devils on horseback (on snack menu): A weird take on pigs in a blanket that involved what I think is spicy mayo and super sweet pulled pork wrapped in bacon. I didn't like it at all, but my friends were fans.   Mac and cheese (on appetizer menu): Very yummy cheese sauce with this Mac, although I do prefer mine to be baked and not just thrown together in a pot. The chorizo really added to it and the crumbly top was a nice texture addition too!  Bone marrow (on appetizer menu):  Three ginormous bones of garlicky fatty goodness. The fixings were what made this so great. The only thing that was unpleasant was that when it cooled it became not so good. Not enough bread to start with in the first place, and took forever to get more.   The salty pig (Flatbread): Salty as ever but good as hell. My friend let me try a piece and it definitely lived up to its name.   Short rib Flatbread: Very delicious and everything I wanted it to be. It was a bit messy to eat, but I didn't care and dove right in.  Wagyu Steak & Pickles: My friend really enjoyed this and his steak was cooked perfectly. It was served on a long wooden plank, which I think is a little ridiculous, but he liked the kimchi and all the picked veggies that came with it.   The service ended up being pretty great by the end, and the food was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best meal I've ever had. When I'm paying those prices, I expect it to blow me away. I'd go back to the the happy hour snack specials sometime, but get dinner elsewhere.",

We were unabashedly sharing everyone's choice of food since we all are broke students so worked great for us. I ordered the buffalo chicken poutine. Ive never had poutine so decided to pop that cherry. It turned out to be pretty good...pretty much just loaded fries  the fried pickels on the other hand were delish! The batter was yummy and the spicy ranch for dipping went perfectly with it. Perfect cheap food if you are not looking to spulrge at M&P ($5 hollaaa). Didnt fancy the fried chicken lives cuz this girl dooesnt like fried chicken livers or just chicken livers. period. My friend enjoyed them and hes a chicken liver afficiando or enthusiast...whichever seems a better fit. Another friend ordered the charred octopus which was ummm interesting. There wasnt much of an octopus on the plate (is octopus expensive?) but the plate was lovely as far as visually pleasing goes. The friend liked it so im guessing job well done. The star of the evening for me was the mushroom rissoto...wow! Mind blown - the consistency and the addition of the truffle oil was just phenomenal. Im gonna come back just for that rissoto and also jealous that i didnt order it. A couple of friends ordered desserts - all of which came in glass jars (cute concept i guess although i prefer my dessert 'not tiny'). The espresso pot de creme was my favorite. The espresso and chocolate were well-balanced out. The runner up was the apple cinnamon cheesecake parfait and the chocolate pot (or whatever it was called) was a total miss for me because it tasted like caramel and not chocolate at all. Overall, a lovely evening and would def frequent this place more often! x",

The seating is the most comfortable ever. the tables along the right hand side are very intimate..if you want to get to know your table neighbs. The deals on Monday night are fabulous--$5 gourmet burgers, $3 fries and many other options. The brunch and Bloody Mary bar are to die for. But the music and ambience, the patrons... all make me very uncomfortable. I'd rather listen to dinner music than listen to a dj spin techno over breakfast or while having a late night meal.",

And drumroll please... Lunch: AWESOME!  There's not many places I can say that about, but they find a way to be creative and deliscious with every meal. I do hope you read all my other reviews on this place for tips on what I thought were gear choice (poutine, cough cough) but for lunch I probably had thee best fish sandwich I've ever had!   They just opened for lunch today and are running a special Lentin menu with fish, fish and more fish... And one burger (seriously, if you don't like fish or a burger you might be screwed till Easter.).   I had the Parmesan fish sammie, which was a generous portion of perfectly battered fish, a VERY generous portion of provolone and tomato sauce. But the crown jewel was the smoked potato salad side dish. Again, generous portion of some of the most delectable and inventive potato salad I've ever had! The smoked taste stayed with me for a while after, but rather than garlic breathe, it was actual a reminder how, oh. My. Gawd. Amazing it was! To be continued....",

Started with devils on horseback (very good!) and split the huge steak for 2. Marrow was fine, but not as good as others I've had...personally did not like the strange breading on top of it. Steak was cooked well and the sides we chose (roasted cauliflower, duck confit potato wedges) were well prepared. Service was great, but the meal didn't quite live up to the hype. Worth it for the experience but not sure the menu is interesting enough to warrant visiting regularly.",

    "text": "I wish I could give 3.5 stars rather than 4, but I decided to give Meat & Potatoes 4 stars due to the service, drinks, and dessert. I would really only go back to M&P for their drinks and dessert, but not for their main courses. I fully recommend getting their special drinks and the Pot de creme. I would also recommend NOT getting the Meat & Potatoes for 2.   I ordered 2 drinks: Fig & Rye and Pimm's Blue Ribbon. Both drinks were perfectly balanced and excellent - perfect mix of sweet, sour, floral-y, and just enough to mask the bitter alcohol flavor. I'm a big fan of their drinks now.   I've heard so many people compliment the \"Meat & Potatoes for 2,\" so obviously I had to try that, but really it was a disappointment. We ordered it to be medium, yet when we got our meal the first time, the steak was rare and too underdone. After we told the waiter, he sent our meal back and we waited to get a new one. We had already waited 45 minutes for our meal since we wanted it medium, and had to wait another 20 minutes to get a new one. When we got it the second time, we expected it to be perfectly cooked. Even though it was closer to medium than the first one, the middle of the steak was completely raw. We ate around the raw part since we didn't want to wait again.   I had told the waiter about this just to let them know that we weren't completely satisfied, and when the manager came over he told us that we should've told them again. I felt like he was lecturing me because I didn't request for a new meal again, but I wasn't prepared to wait another 20 minutes and get the same meal a third time...Instead, he comped our appetizer and our dessert. I thought this gesture was extremely kind, but to be honest, I just wanted to have a good steak. I would say that the flavor of the steak is nothing special, and for a place called \"Meat & Potatoes\" it does disappoint. I've had steaks that are way better. I wish I had ordered something else off their menu.   Other components of the \"2,\" were bone marrow, mushroom ragu, and fries. The bone marrow was unpleasant....I'm not a big fan of gelatinous textures especially of savory foods, and really I felt like I was eating pure fat covered in salty parmesan. The mushroom ragu was standard. The fries were good because they were super crispy on the outside but soft in the inside.   I think what really made me give M&P 4 stars was the dessert. We ordered the Pot de Creme and S'mores. The s'mores was nothing special and I sort of regret ordering it. The pot de creme was AMAZING. It was a chocolate version, but it reminded me of toffee and nougat. I wish they had told us that there would be nuts on top of it since I am allergic to nuts, but luckily the nights only touched the top (whipped cream) and not the rest of the jar. It was super silky, creamy, and had the perfect amount of sweetness.   I would say that M&P is not worth raving about, but it is worth a try.",

The pig ears were crispy with a super balanced thai chili sauce (wish I had ordered beer to pair with that dish!). The dates with chorizo were paired with a super fresh tomato sauce. All the cocktails were really well balanced and not overly sweet. We shared the pappardelle for an entree. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the rich sauce was stick to your ribs good. This was definitely more of a winter dish, but it was a cool evening so it worked out. All the food was very good- not knock my socks off, but definitely above average!  The service was so-so. We got to the restaurant early for our 8pm reservation (7:45). Although there were many tables visually available, we still had to wait a little for a table. In fact, a family of four without reservations came in while we were waiting and were seated before us... Our waiter was nice, but not super attentive. It was at least 15 minutes before he even took our drink order.... And 20-25 minutes before we received our drinks. He didn't really check in on us... Overall, I expect more when a meal is in this price point. The bus staff, however, was super attentive and great!   So overall, above average and unique, but not life altering.",

If you are curious, order the Tartare, If you thought you would never eat raw meat, order the Tartare, If you think eating raw meat is weird, order the Tartare, If you want to experience something completely delicious and unexpected order the Tartare !!!  Did I say order the Tartare ??  You will not be disappointed, I can promise you that.   I went with three friends before a Play and they did ask us if we were going to a show and the time to make sure that we were not late.  Also if you have leftovers, and you probably will, they will hold them for you so you can pick them up after your show. The place was immaculate, the staff was super friendly and the food was everything I expected it to be.  We had the fried brussel sprouts they were cheesy and tasty and the mussels of the day.  The mussels were plentiful (enough for 2 people)and comes with garlic bread.  My friend ordered the pork chop which was huge; it took up the whole plate.  It was a triple chop and cooked absolutely perfectly. I ordered the Three little Pigs.  Panchetta, pork fillet, ham, swiss and an unGodly perfect egg atop.  You will be incredibly full and satisfied when you leave this place.   The drinks at the bar are reasonable for the Burgh and very, very good and the Bartenders are attentive. This place is a MUST if you are in the Burgh and like Meat,  and by the way Order the Tartare !!",

If I could choose a restaurant's decor, this would be it. Sexy velvet, white ceramic animals, metal curio cabinets, and a gorgeous white fireplace. Yes please! We made a reservation but wound up getting there about 15 minutes late. (We called to tell them we'd be late.) We expected a bit of a wait but were happy to be seated immediately upon arrival.  While perusing the menu, the waitress brought over big mugs of coffee and described the specials which included a Pastry of the Day. Tip to all brunch restaurants, have a Pastry of the Day. This particular day it was described as a criossant monkey bread with a Krispy Kreme glaze twist. Needless to say, we ordered it. I could have had this and a cup of coffee and walked away satisfied. It was fresh, soft, crispy, sweet. Exactly as described as a Krispy Kreme monkey bread. Holy cow. They should put this on the menu permanently.   T got the huevos ranchero and I got the French toast. The huevos ranchero were great, cheesy and spicy. I found the black beans a touch bland but that was my only complaint. My French toast was amazing and came with bacon almond brittle. Yum! My only complaint was my own doing. I had sweet upon sweet and I should have ordered a savory breakfast since we got the pastry. But that's my own fault. I definitely want to go back the next time we're in Pittsburgh to try other dishes, in particular the chicken and waffles. The owners of this place are opening another spot soon and I'd definitely like to check that out as well!",

It is constantly topping the charts as one of Pittsburgh's best places to eat and is great for lunch, brunch, cocktails or dinner.  I have been here on multiple occasions (including work-related lunches) and have not been disappointed.    The Meat & Potatoes for Two might be my favorite thing on their dinner menu. It is a beautiful, mouthwatering, bone-in 34 oz Ribeye, cooked to your liking (medium-rare for me) served with bone marrow gratin and steak fries... Amazing! I substituted poutine for the steak fries (for an additional charge).   I also think they have one of the best burgers in the city (their lamb burger is my go-to burger in the 'Burgh). Their Monday night late night menu features a nice variety of burgers and snacks to help kick-start your week.  Starting Oct. 6th they will begin POUTINE MONDAYS Nightcap ...  Stay current with seasonal menu pages and check out their website or Facebook page for details.  All in all their servers are super friendly and knowledgeable and the bartenders are very skilled and creative.   Not only is the food delicious but I also love the atmosphere- the dim lighting sets the tone for a perfect date night! I recommend pulling up a seat at the bar and letting the bartender take care of you. Their full menu is served at the bar so this is also a great option if you are coming in last minute without a reservation.    I love the food, love what they are up to and will definitely keep coming back for more (hopefully you will too). Enjoy!",

    "text": "I've been here thrice. Twice for brunch and once for dinner.   Big fan of the brunch. I've heard oodles and oodles of good things about the Bloody Mary bar, but have yet to try it myself.   I got the Irish Benedict. Fantastic. But very, very filling. I wouldn't have traded it for anyone else's dish, though. Bit bland, but if you like Hollandaise Sauce, M&P has a good one.   I also had the Fried Chicken & Waffles. The maple syrup served with it was great. It made the dish. Not like regular maple syrup, this was a little thinner, with bacon bits in it. The fried chicken was fairly spicy as well, which I liked, gave it a zing.   Dinner was good, but nothing special. They do an excellent job cooking their meat. I had lamb and I got to try some of my friend's mutton, which was very tender, very soft.   I love the restaurant space, with the mirrors around the walls, and the chalkboards. Sometimes I think I come more for the atmosphere, environment, and people-watching more than the food.   But don't get me wrong. The food's good. Like real good. So you should go. But definitely make a reservation. At least one week out because the place fills up fast.",

We ate there one Light-Up Night in Pittsburgh with reservations being made more than a month in advance.  For 4 people, they pulled together two very small round tables right near the bar.  It was obnoxious and so loud that we could not have a conversation.  The food was ok, nothing special.",

    "text": "Meat & Potatoes was an obvious choice on the 'Pittsburgh to visit' list as all of the Yelp reviews rave about it. We got there at about 5:30 PM not realizing really how small this place is. Spoiler alert: this place is fricking tiny. Don't let the mirrors fool you into thinking there's a back dining area. It's just a reflection.  They couldn't accommodate us at a table, so we headed to the bar. The bar was packed, but I was able to snag one seat next to some guys in suits. Come to find out, the older dude was a complete ass and I overheard him saying some really mean things to the busboy (he was however nice to the female bartender....) If you're out there and reading this, I have 0 respect for people like you. Learn some common courtesy. Okay, moving on..  I ordered the drink special which was some kind of pear concoction. It had a bunch of different herbs and spices that made it sound bizarre, but it tasted phenomenal. We also went for the fried pickles. They were really good but extremely hot. I had to cut them up in little pieces just to be able to release the steam.  The service was great and what you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. There was a female and male bartender and they were both on point with making sure everyone had a drink or food.  We had originally planned on eating dinner here but decided since we only had 2 days in 'Burgh that we were ready to try another place on our list, so we headed out after a couple of drinks and appetizer. If I came here for dinner and ate a full meal, I would probably give 5 stars too. Their menu looked divine and I hope to make it back soon to give it a real go.",

I will say that Sundays are overwhelmingly busy and the place is pretty small. So, if you don't mind a crowd, it's a fine place for brunch. I went again recently on a weeknight. Although the food was good, there was nothing original or impressive about it. I'm an avid home cook, so I recognize a lot of dishes \"borrowed\" from more established chefs out there. Still, it was tasty and I think that this restaurant is a good addition to the downtown restaurant scene. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "I LOVED Meat & Potatoes so much I went for dinner on Friday evening and back for brunch on Sunday morning.  I made both reservations about a month in advance of my trip, and the pickings were already a bit slim in terms of the times available. Strongly recommend a reservation, as the place was crowded both times, even at opening on Sunday morning on a snowy day. The front of the house seems a bit disorganized, so after waiting for almost 10 minutes and the confusion of who would seat us, we opted not to check our coats.  The dining room is not super large, and is dominated by a huge bar. It was hopping at 8:00 on a Friday night. We sat at a two top- a tiny, round marble table on the front side of the room. There are about 10 of these in very close proximity to one another. While cute, they're a bit too small to accommodate the admittedly large amount of food we wanted to order. I found it a bit awkward to be so close to my neighbors (why not just have a communal table?) This is not significant enough to prevent me from returning, and I actually prefer more tables + less wait to fewer tables.   The beer list was extensive and well-priced, with options from $3-$8. We started with fried brussels sprouts, which were a bit lemony and covered in parmesan cheese. These were AMAZING. Even if you don't like brussels sprouts, try these! I ordered the lamb burger and my fiance had the fish and chips. Be aware that the fish and chips have such a fancy presentation that they don't look like traditional fish and chips, and my midwestern fiance was not thrilled. They're stacked individually, and the tartar sauce and cold greens top them, which created serious temperature issues. We wouldn't order these again. The lamb burger was delicious- cooked perfectly well, the house-made bun was pillowy soft, and it was very well-seasoned and flavorful. The fries were among the best I've ever had- even my normally fry-hating fiancee was fighting for these. For dessert, we got a cooked chocolate mousse that was delicious.  We returned for brunch on Sunday morning at 10:30, right when they open. We had to drive back to Chicago that day, and it was snowing. The place was totally full by about 10:50. Service was impeccable, and we liked the brunch even more than the delicious dinner. I had the chicken and waffles, which were extremely well executed. The chicken was so flavorful and moist, and the cornbread jalapeno waffle was the perfect vessel to eat the chicken. There were also four enormous pieces of chicken! It came with delicious bourbon maple syrup with chunks of pepper bacon. The perfect sweet and savory meal!  My fiance ordered the kimchee brisket with eggs, and he loved it. He ate every last bite, and hasn't stopped talking about for the last week.  In summary: go here, order everything, leave satisfied. You will not regret it. We are plotting to go back to Pittsburgh solely to go to this restaurant!",
