Eating \"Chad's Vanilla\" became my weekly reward after finishing a three-mile loop that I take to get to the place. I love the wonderful waffle smell. I take my time with the ice-cream and always get nervous when eating in a waffle cone. Instead, I just get broken waffle bits as a topping on my ice-cream.  I try to find places like Millie's in the other cities I visit, but I can never find creamier and nicer ice creams anywhere else. Their scoops are huge. I always get a junior size (single scoop) and struggle to finish it. They are very nice and welcoming. It can get crowded during summers. I go to Millie's even if during sub-zero Pittsburgh winters.  They have tons of flavors. But I almost always get Chad's vanilla which is unlike every other vanilla I have had. I would give this place 6 stars if I can.",

Almost to the point that it started to taste a bit like candy. The cream, and texture really won me over. You can certainly taste the homemade quality and the effort that they put into their ice cream. However it was not one of my favorite ice cream places that I've tried. Leopold still holds my heart in Savannah. That is truly one of the best ice cream experiences that I've had to date. While I do you like this location I don't think that it warrants the long lines. We had to wait quite long on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM.  We tried the Vietnamese Coffee, Yuzuberry, and Chad's Vanilla Ice Cream.  Also had the waffle cone.  The Yuzuberry wasn't that great, felt lighter and less creamier than the other flavors.  Also, I have to admit I miss Oh yeah that use to be in this location.  My favorite combo was their sweet cream ice cream with fig and goat cheese mix in.  Simply the best! I think if you are in the area you should definitely try it out.",

Millie's has its for standard flavors (including chocolate, vanilla, Vietnamese coffee, and salted caramel) and rotates through a few others. I tried a sample of the pistachio rose and hated it (sorry, but at least I can say it's just me, not the ice cream). I also tried a sample of the caramel and it was amazing.   With a small you get 2 scoops ($4, they're pretty but scoops, which filled my waffle cone) so you can get 2 flavors, but I didn't want to mix anything with my perfect caramel. The waffle cone is an extra $1--they use a marshmallow as a stopper in the bottom to prevent your ice cream from melting through!  The place is really bright and clean and sometimes they have a back patio open for you to enjoy your ice cream.",

Millie's is on Highland near a bunch of restaurants, so it's the perfect nightcap to any dinner.   I walked in and the first thing you notice is how clean it is. It's also very well lit. I mean ice cream really does make me happy, but so does Millie's ambience.   I ordered 2 scoops of Vanilla and Vietnamese coffee. Both really good. The scoops were huge, so I probably could have gotten away with just one scoop of ice cream. It took me forever to eat it. The service was super quick.   After getting our sweets, we sat down at one of the tables. Once again, super nice and clean. We stayed and talked for about 2 hours. And no one disturbed us. The staff just let us hang even after we were done with our ice cream.   This restaurant is on a busy street with lots of other eateries, so anticipate a line. It got pretty busy when we were there.",

Floats were $7-$9, and I think waffle cones were $6, which is WAY more than Dave and Andy's. I get that rent on South Highland is probably terrible but wow. And unfortunately, the ice cream quality was more than not great.  My single scoop had so much sugar that you could see it. I was so sick of the scoop halfway through because it just tasted like pure sugar.  The consistency is also very icy and not creamy, which is not my thing.  The store is cute, the menu is simple, and the staff is nice.  There is both outdoor and indoor seating, and the interior is clean.  The waffle cones looked really good, but at this price and quality, I will stick to Dave and Andy's.",

Whenever I'm in Shadyside, I make sure it's one of my manyyyyy stops.   9 out of 10 times, there is a line out the door, but it is absolutely worth it!   Staff is friendly and very patient when you can't decide which flavors you want!   I've never tried a flavor I didn't like. I've had the vanilla, chocolate, Vietnamese Coffee, dulce de leche, and more recently since it is the season,  pumpkin.   I am usually boring and just go with a scoop in a cup, but sometimes I feel adventurous and go with a cone.   Everything is fresh and always tastes fresh!",

I went with the \"tin roof\" ice cream which was vanilla with caramel and peanuts. It was pretty good, but the peanuts were super large making it a little odd. My boyfriend got the chocolate and he loved it. The line was pretty long, which influenced me to fight my urge to ask for a bunch of samples. I'm hoping when I visit again the line will be shorter so I can try some more options and find my favorite flavor. The staff was so friendly and the ambiance was so cozy here. I also LOVED that they have vegan ice cream as well! So cool!",

    "text": "Oh man, Millie's!! It's an awesome little hometown ice cream shop in East Liberty that provides a designer, high-quality experience with tasty ice cream options and delicious homemade waffle cones.   Who should visit with me? It's like perfect for an after-dinner stop on a date. Or bring all your friends - perfect for that too!   Favorite thing about this place: I mostly love the care and quality that the put into everything. The ice cream flavors, the decor - all awesome and incredibly inviting and comforting!   I'd love it more if: I wasn't there on a busy night, but I think I'd love it more if they had a few more chairs inside and tables to sit at in general. But it's an ice cream shop - what could I expect? It just seems like more sating could fit in there. Maybe I'm wrong.  Ambience/Location: The location is great. We got street parking and it was super close. There wasn't a bit line when we went either - probably because it was so cold out, so only devoted ice cream eaters were coming out for dessert tonight!   Service: Super friendly! My husband is lactose intolerant and they even have Lactaid pills available for purchase right on the counter. Perfect, brilliant idea! So thoughtful and it makes me buy in to the fact that they truly care about their customers!  Tips:  1) Go on a cold night - you'll still love the ice cream and will get it super fast! 2) The \"regular\" size is two scoops - go for it! It's like the perfect amount if you're really craving some serious scoops 3) You can combine flavors in the same cone.   Recommended Dish: I recommend pumpkin and chocolate. This is a weird taste fetish that I'm developing, and I love it. Seriously try it. If you love both flavors separately, you may really enjoy this! Dooooooo it!",

There are several flavors including their featured ones, and I'm certain that anyone can find a flavor that they enjoy. I always love their cones; very rarely do I get a cup. Even the though the line is usually long extending out the door to the sidewalk, it moves at a good pace. There's indoor seating as well as a few tables outside on the deck.",

I have been here at least 20 to 30 times as sad as it sounds, but their ice cream is just to die for!  They have so many unique flavors that keep you coming back for more.  I always stick with my standard of the Vietnamese coffee in about of this world waffle cone and add on another seasonal flavor.  My absolute all-time favorite besides the Vietnamese is a toasted rice and citrus which I have not seen since last summer and I'm sad :(.   We also picked up pints to go in addition last June I ordered my husband's birthday cake from Here.  We did lemon ice cream on the top and strawberry ice cream on the bottom with a crushed waffle cone crossed and waffle cones along the side of the cake.  It was pricy, but totally worth it!   Millie's we will be back again and again!!",

It did not have that artificial taste. The vietnamese coffee was also decadent with it not being too bitter. The waffle cone was also delicious. My only complaint was that the waffle cone was leaking through the bottom, which was not ideal. Overall, an excellent homemade ice cream place. I know I will be back!",

Not only is their ice cream uniquely flavored (but also comforting -- seriously, try the lemon blackberry or the coffee), dreamily creamy, and a perfect pick-me-up after a long day -- they also support the community. I've had the privilege to meet Melissa and Chad at the community event where they provided ice cream and personally scooped and handed out the ice cream themselves. It felt great to support a local business, and have them support the community in turn. Thanks, Millie's!",

My husband and I love having dinner at nearby Dinette, and I think we've unofficially added Millie's cold and creamy treats to our routine. Parking can be tricky immediately on Highland Ave, so eating dinner at Dinette first and parking in their lot is actually quite convenient.   I have particularly enjoyed some of Millie's more innovative flavors, including the White Chocolate and Rhubarb Jam and the Pistachio Honey. The Best Chocolate is also a delicious option and is very rich and flavorful.  Unfortunately, though the waffle cones in theory should be amazing, they've been so warm the two times that I've ordered them that my ice cream begins to melt immediately upon contact. Even though they're tasty, I won't be ordering one again due to the melting affect.   In the summer on the weekend, the line either piles up outside the front door or wraps around the shop. I think Millie's could make some logistical or training changes to make the checkout process more efficient and to not turn away customers.",

I chose cookie dough ice cream because some of the flavors are a little too adventurous for me.  My ice cream was far from perfect. It tasted like sweet frozen butter.

The store was set further back from the street and had a couple of picnic tables out in front. When I walked in around 7:30 pm, the line was already to the door. However, it moved quickly, and I needed that time to consider all the flavors anyway!  I tried \"the best chocolate\" and pistachio rose. Their tasting spoons are metal and reusable. The chocolate had a very strong chocolate flavor, but it wasn't as dark as I was hoping for, so I went with a scoop of pistachio rose and a scoop of strawberry ice cream in a bowl ($4). There are tables and bar seating inside, as well as picnic benches in front and behind the shop. Since it was nice out, I enjoyed my ice cream outside.  The pistachio rose ice cream had a subtler flavor which less sweetness. I tasted honey. The pistachios gave the ice cream a nice crunch. The strawberry ice cream had a very strong, intense strawberry flavor, which was great. By the end of the scoop, though, it got a little too sweet.   Can't wait to try some other flavors, a waffle cone, and maybe the brioche!",

Mack ordered first and by the time I was ready no one would make eye contact with me for a bit. It was odd. Again, they are surely still working out the kinks, so not mad about it.  The ice cream was delicioso. I had peanut butter and chocolate in a cone and it was divine.  Mack ordered dulce de leche and chocolate in a cone and his cone was not made properly and not 3 minutes after we left it had dripped out of the side of the bottom and all over his clothes. It should have been sealed up, and they even put some marshmallow in the bottom to prevent drips, but his cone wasn't wrapped tight enough when it was made so it leaked all over. He was sad. So, I would recommend checking your cone for structural integrity and maybe asking for a bowl for backup.",

My girlfriend and I have had several ice cream flavors now across our visits including 'best chocolate', vanilla, salted caramel, strawberry, pineapple, and dark chocolate.  We're both chocolate lovers and the 'best chocolate' flavor is indeed our favorite flavor of ice cream here, but they're all good.  The service is prompt and as fast as it can be, but the line takes a while to move through because everyone likes to get several free samples when they get to the counter which slows things down somewhat.  The prices are fair and the staff is friendly.  They sell pints as well, so we'll have to pick up some to devour at home sometime.",

I was worried it would be packed, but it was later at night, so it wasn't bad at all. Since it wasn't super crowded they made our waffle cones for us on the spot, which was awesome. It did take a few minutes, but it was worth the wait. The cones came out a little warm and soft like a waffle, which was unique and awesome! I had the dark chocolate and salted caramel flavors, while my boyfriend had chocolate and vanilla. He said it was the best vanilla he's ever had. I preferred the regular chocolate over the dark chocolate, but it was still good. The salted caramel was good as well.   The next time we visited it was much more packed and the cones were pre-made so they weren't warm and soft, which was a tiny bit disappointing, but they were still good. I wouldn't expect them to be able to make them as they go when there's a line out the door. I got lavender, which was amazing! I sampled the thai iced tea, which was interesting but not for me. And my boyfriend sampled the Vietnamese coffee, which was awesome!  I saw some customers complaining about the scoop size in their reviews here, but I felt like it was an ok size for handmade ice cream. I usually get a regular cone so I can have 2 flavors and it's more than enough ice cream.   We will definitely be back many times!",

The line was almost out the door, but we stuck it out and it was worth it.  The flavor selection is limited.  But that's fine.  You want the five spice honey flavor ice cream.  Don't question it, just accept that it will become your new favorite.    You'll want to get two scoops and have it in a waffle cone.  It's slightly pricier than some other ice cream places, but it's worth it.  Plus the waffle cone comes with marshmallows at the bottom to keep the ice cream from leaking out which is really clever and a great way to end your ice cream cone.  Finally,  the weather's getting nice so i would recommend sitting outside to enjoy your cone.  It gets a bit crowded and loud at the inside tables, so take advantage of it.",

One problem - if it's busy and the cones freshly made, they're still warm, and you know what that means...we experienced this problem on one recent trip and had to rush down our cones before everything melted away. On a more recent visit, on a busier night, they had planned appropriately and had plenty of fresh but cooled down cones ready to go, so I guess it depends on time of day and perhaps who's working. The flavors change regularly and some are quite inventive and unique, which adds to the charm and experience. There's indoor and outdoor seating and the space is clean and well lit. All in all, the place to go when in the 'Burgh for great ice cream.",

It's a cute little place; not as 'against the establish' kind of stuff that was 'Oh Yeah' (i.e. I don't think they will be opening a BANK as well lol). Inside there is a large farm mural too which I found also very cute.   The BF had the best chocolate and I had the salted caramel. You can definitely tell this is real deal homemade stuff; very rich and very creamy. The BF, as usual, was \"eh\" about the chocolate, the ice cream elitist that he is. We both agreed the salted caramel was way intense. I thought both were very good. I think he's more of a Dave & Andy's man. Either way, the real star of the show is the cone. They are fantastic! Soft and flavorful, with a delicious smell that beckons, \"Please come inside. Please order me.\"  It doesn't look like they are real big on mix-ins or anything, so this is not the place to go for a knock-off blizzard. But if you want a very good cup of ice cream I'd check it out. There is a bench outside, usually monopolized by hipsters smoking, but hopefully they'll get a few more tables or something; that would be very nice.",

But you know, common decency forbids trying every flavor. Well, the friendly ice cream scoopers offered - without us asking - to scoop us a sample of every flavor. While we didn't take them up on it, I was instantly in love. The spiced rum & banana, the pear sorbet and the ricotta/pistachio/cherry were amazing surprises. I am SO enthusiastic to come back and try every other flavor I missed on the first go-round. Oh and I didn't mention the smell of fresh caramelized waffles that hits you when you enter. This is going to easily be my new favorite scoop shop in the 'Burgh.

We were actually already stuffed from a big lunch, but on a hot day, who doesn't want ice cream?  Although full, as said, I decided on 3 scoops - honey pistachio, chocolate and a maple bourbon.  My partner ordered a brioche ice cream sandwich.  WHAT you say?  Brioche ice cream sandwich?  Why yes, you heard correctly.  What a unique thing to serve.  Although I forget the ice cream she had it loaded with, I won't forget the look on her face when she tasted it.  Heavenly would be a good description.  My three flavors tasted just as described.  The ice cream was light and delicious.  Beyond the interesting ice flavor combos they served up, they also offered sorbet and the typical vanilla and chocolate.  I think that's nice because it lends itself to bringing customers in who want the regular when their compadres want to try something different.  We sat inside, but there are picnic tables in the front and back which were available.  A very enjoyable experience.  We will be back!",

I have spent a lot of time in Columbus and Millie's is definitely the closest thing Pittsburgh has to Jeni's, though I have to say that Jeni's still wins by a landslide.   The store is cutely decorated, friendly and inviting. We came with a group of four on a rainy Saturday around 4pm and we only waited a few minutes and easily found a table inside. I had Chad's Vanilla and the Salted Caramel. The ice cream was really tasty but I will note that it does have more of an icy texture rather than being on the extremely creamy side as others have mentioned. Fine by me, but it's not for everyone.   I had my ice cream in a bowl but my friend got the waffle cone and it looked delicious. It's nice that they put a little marshmallow in the bottom so the ice cream doesn't drip out.   Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee flavors that I sampled were also delicious. I like how they reuse the sample spoons...who can argue with being green!   The ice cream was a bit on the pricey side but that is to be expected with a gourmet shop like this. The prices were right on par with Jeni's. for 4 of us each getting two scoops and one waffle cone it came to a little under $19.",

I'm lactose intolerant (but don't ever take that into consideration unfortunately) so I think it's nice that they sell lactaid for 50 cents at the counter.   The decor is also really cute inside - lots of pink and there's a little counter that is reminiscent of old time-y ice cream parlours.   I went here so often during my last year in Pittsburgh, easily every couple of weeks. It's relatively affordable but I probably was too frequent of a visitor.",

Many people were sitting outside in the front and in the back on the patio. A very bright atmosphere, with the menu in big writing immediately above your head, I was hoping for something more kitschy.   I tried the Lavender flavor before I made my decision, but I think it would have been too strong for me in the long run, so I decided to just try the chocolate. I figured with all the wonderful things I had heard, that the chocolate would still blow me away just as much as a fig or other strange flavor would.   It was expensive, I spent over $8 there on two cones with a junior scoop in it each. I took a bite and alas, incredibly ordinary. It was good, and had a nice chocolate flavor, but it did not blow me away like I thought it would. Maybe I hyped it up too much. I like ice cream that is creamy like Coldstone, and I was really hoping for varieties with chunks of something in them. I am interested in the odd flavors, but when push comes to shove I would take a knock-out vanilla or rocky road over lavender any day. And if I wanted a strange flavor, I believe Razzy Fresh wins that award with their Taro flavored frozen yogurt.   One thing that WAS incredible was their waffle cone. I have actually never had a better waffle cone in my life. Somehow, crunchy and chewy at the same time, I would go back just to experience the cone.",

I spent the next three minutes tasting the other scoop trying to find the salted caramel taste. Turns out I mixed them up! Once I realized, the flavors shone through. The salted caramel was VERY salty and had a heavily burnt caramel taste, but I liked it nonetheless. The cinnamon was deliciously rich as well. I take it as a good sign when simple flavors are made right - I'll definitely be back!",

We tried some of their more common flavors- salted caramel and chocolate, at a CSA event and signed up for the CSA based on our experiences there. We've since tried Concord grape sorbet, Mission Fig ice cream, and Apple cider sorbet and all of them have been absolutely delicious. Plus, what is more fun than top-notch ice cream delivered to your house?! Last but not least, it should be noted that Chad and Lauren are kind, down-to-earth people who take pride in providing a superior product. We've enjoyed tasting and eating their ice cream as a family and I'm already trying to convince my son that the Spring CSA would be an excellent birthday gift for him (and the rest of us!)",

They also have delicious popular waffle cones made onsite. Some Yelp comments mentioned the flavors being overpowerful, so I was drawn to the Toasted Oat Maple flavor which was delightfully light. I added peppermint as well. I wish I had gone for one of the bolder flavors, though.  One thing that is a major challenge for me at Millie's is the entrance with steps. The first two are manageable, the second two are challenging and the last one is impossible fir me without help. There is an iron railing, but it is merely decorative.  One thing I really like about this place is when you ask for small scoops, they truly give you small scoops. I still didn't finish it due to a large dinner, but at least there wasn't a ton of wasted ice cream.  The flavors are good. I didn't detect sny graininess or particles of ice in the cream. It was straightforward good homemade ice cream.",

    "text": "What can I say about Millie's that hasn't already been said? This is one of the latest trendy ice cream shops in Pittsburgh...the constant line out the door was our first indication of how beloved this place already is. Although there was a line, it moved fairly quickly, and the friendly employees were passing out samples of chocolate to people as they waited (smart move...sugar is a surefire way to stave off any restless crowd impatience!)  When we finally made it inside, it was like walking into a cheerful, bright, happy cloud. Bubblegum pink striped walls, white faux-subway tile on the walls behind the counter, colorful murals....the decor of this shop immediately makes you remember the pure, simple, child-like joy that eating an ice cream cone can bring.  Speaking of the ice cream, Millie's niche is homemade, natural ice cream in artisan flavors (a subset of which change regularly). The employees are happy to let you sample whatever you like before you make your selection. My husband and I both got the smallest size (junior, one scoop). We chose seasonal flavors, me the blueberry graham cracker in a cup, and him the peach in a sugar cone.  One bite of Millie's and it's evident that where they excel in the ice cream world is flavor. Both of our scoops were bursting with real fruit...no fake frankenflavors here. So fresh and pure. While the flavor of the ice cream is amazing, I must admit that the texture is not my favorite. The ice cream was more on the icy side than the creamy side. I'm no ice cream scientist (though I don't know why I didn't pursue that career path!), but I'd imagine that stabilizers and all of the other artificial things manufacturers add to ice cream probably help create that \"perfect\" creamy texture and silky mouthfeel that we're all used to. Because Millie's doesn't use any of these unnatural ingredients (which is great), texture likely suffers a bit as a result. No matter though. Their incredible flavors, friendly service, and unique offerings will have me coming back often to slurp up my frozen sugar happiness.",

    "text": "Outside of snakebit Jeni's Ice Cream of Columbus, Ohio, Millie's offers just about the best ice cream you're likely to find in about an eight-hour radius.  A \"whole other level\" is a pretty dumb phrase to use to describe food, but how do you distinguish A-plus ice cream from solid-A or A-minus ice cream?  There just ain't that many food descriptors for ice cream outside of creaminess and depth and richness of flavor.  But unless your taste buds and \"mouth feel\" receptors are busted, you'll recognize as soon as you spoon Millie's stuff into your mouth that it's on a \"whole other level\" from just about 95 percent of the ice cream you normally consume.    Millie's sharp, white-tiled little Shadyside shop is charming, bright, and airy.  The staff on duty was as pleasant as they could be, and very willing to offer sample tastes of whichever flavor might catch your eye.  I went with the Vietnamese Coffee, which I gather is a popular one.  As an avid consumer of both the Vietnamese cafe sua da and of coffee ice cream, I didn't recognize that the flavor was especially that of Vietnamese coffee, but it was for damn sure a \"whole other level\" coffee ice cream.    Only drawback on this day:  The shop was playing some modern Broadway show-tune dreck that was so ebullient and saccharine as to be ghastly.  Unfortunately, it was so hot on this day outside (this was back in August) that our ice cream would have quickly turned into just cream  if we'd fled the scene.    While I was eating it, though, Millie's superb ice cream had the magic power to silence that music in my mind.  It's that good.",

    "text": "The bottom line is that Millie's ice cream is really, really, really good.  So good that, in the summer, at least 3 nights a week my boyfriend and I consider making the trek from Lawrenceville to Shadyside just for Millie's.  Millie's is housed in the former Oh Yeah! ice cream space. Unlike its predecessor, the ice cream is homemade (by Chad Townsend, former executive chef of Salt of the Earth). You can definitely tell the difference.  The decor and space are reminiscent of an old fashioned ice cream parlor, with scoop door handles, a logo the shade of pink that makes you think of the 50s, and some other vintage decor. Nevertheless there's a very clean, new feel to the space.  There is a constantly rotating collection of specialty flavors, along with some staples that seem to always be available (chocolate, vanilla, salted caramel).  Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee seem to be frequent repeats as well, though I'm not sure if that's a seasonal thing.  There is often a line outside the door.  They started offering pre-packed pints, though, and if you're just there to grab one of those, you can skip the line of flavor-tasters and head right to the cashier (pro tip).  Thank you, Millie's, for finally bringing Pittsburgh the delicious, high-quality local ice cream we have waited so long for!",

These flavors were all over the place and many fruit flavors which I am not that keen on.  I went with the chocolate and my husband got the salted caramel which were both tasty. We were both so glad that we upgraded and got it in a waffle cone which I typically do not do and usually go with a cup.  Hands down this was the best waffle cone I have ever had. I don't know what they do to make it taste that good but it is so worth it and honestly the flavor of ice cream doesn't even matter. The line was long but we stuck it out. The prices are fine and they have a great indoor and outdoor seating area.",

There's enough inside seating and plenty of picnic tables outside for when it is warm.   There are so many amazing flavors to choose from - you can also get waffle cones or have the ice cream in a cup.   For my first experience, I ordered Chad's Vanilla and the Peach flavor - this ice cream is out of this world. It is some of the best ice cream that I've ever had. I'm telling all my friends.

The only downside is that their scoops are labeled by a size name and not scoop number so I had to ask what each size actually meant... and it's a bit expensive.

They have excellent versions of staple flavors (chocolate, vanilla, etc.), but they also venture into more unique flavors (ex. ricotta almond) that are outstanding. Their waffle cones are also freshly-made with just the right amount of sweetness.  The only reason that I'm taking one star off is because it is rather expensive. You're looking at ~$6 for a single scoop in a waffle cone.",

They don't have the best prices, which I kind of expected. The portions aren't the worst, but if I'm paying $5-$7 for a small I expect some big scoops comparable to Baskin Robbins. The parking is TERRIBLE. There's very limited street parking (that you pay for, of course) in front of the store - good luck finding a spot. Even the surrounding side streets were packed. For those who are lactose intolerant, they sell individual Lactaid pills by the cash register, which I thought was very considerate. I don't know about the price for that though. I don't know if I'd go out of my way to go back, but it was a pleasant experience if we ignore the years I spent traversing the neighborhoods to reach the parking-less store.",

Noodlehead and Millie's are right next to each other so they are always a good combo for dinner and dessert. Their flavors change quite often. My personal favourite is Lavender and Chad's vanilla.  Their ice cream is known for its creamy texture. I gave them a 3 star because some of the flavours was too creamy and sweet for my taste. Also, it seems like the texture of their ice cream is not very consistent and changes a lot based on the day's batch of ice cream.",

I'll spend the money on fun new foods and desserts, but this homemade ice cream was not as good as other places I've had.  When we first walked in, it seemed like a really cute ice cream shop with a lot of flavors to try, but the flavors they had posted on the wall didn't seem consistent with what they were actually serving. Some of the flavors written on the wall weren't labeled in the cooler, so they weren't available, which is disappointing if you have your hopes up for a certain flavor. Also, the first person that asked to serve us didn't seem in a good mood. Yes, it was a Saturday night, but that's not a great first impression when a new customer walks in.  They had fun paintings on the wall, but not much seating available on a Saturday night. We found a spot at the bar-like area. The other employee was very nice and accommodating when I bothered him twice for an extra spoon, and then a lid to go.  The pictures shown are cookie dough and peanut butter on a cone!",

Especially when the shop is as adorable as Millie's and features interesting high-end varieties (as well as some tried and True classics)!   Though they had a lot of tempting options on display when I visited, i didn't think twice once I saw the strawberry rosewater flavor. Those are two of my all-time favorite flavors of anything, so combined I knew I just couldn't resist. I got it in a cup and ordered the waffle cone pieces as a topping - such a genius idea for those who don't want to commit to an entire huge waffle cone (though the freshly made cones smelled amazing and were hard to say no to).   Ice cream is subjective, and personally I prefer a lighter, flavor-heavy kind vs. a super creamy rich kind, and this ice cream tended more toward Team Creamy. I wished I could taste a little bit more of the berry and rose flavors, but overall it was really well-made and of course tasty on a hot day. Browsing through all of the flavors listed at both of their locations (looks like they have different ones at their different stores) makes me wish I could come back on the daily and keep trying everything, but for now I'll have to just dream about another trip to Millie's until my next visit to PGH!",

The marshmallows at the bottom of the cone were a nice treat, since I love marshmallows. My husband got a chocolate milkshake and that shit was BOMB!    Service was decent but I'm a little concerned with the lady working behind the counter with long dreads that nearly dipped into the ice cream every time she reached down to scoop some out. Health code violation?   5 starts for the ice cream and service but minus 1 for the dread lock dipping , which was a little concerning :\\  I would still come back, guaranteed.",

Anyway, the ice cream is fantastic; probably the best coffee ice cream that I've ever had anywhere (Jeni's I'm looking in your direction.)  I have no idea how much it cost because I couldn't find pricing displayed anywhere (note: I was chasing toddlers so I might not have looked carefully enough) but I know it was great and it didn't cost that much.  Minus one star because it is in Pittsburgh; I promise to upgrade when the Browns win a Super Bowl and I can stop feeling inadequate.",

I told people afterwards how I'm always kind of *shrug* about getting ice cream - it's something people always want to do, but as a savory-lover myself, I never feel fulfilled afterwards. Wellllll I had quite the opposite experience at Millie's! As soon as you walk into the store, you smell the waffle cones's sugary scent and then your eyes notice a girl baking them behind the counter and then your mouth starts to water and you NEED a waffle cone that second. The pistachio honey special on the 4th of July was SO good, and I was relieved to see the girl scoop only one scoop in the cone because I feel like most places usually over do it on the ice cream and under-do the attention on the fact all you want is that waffle cone! Awesome place!! Will be back tonight :)",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I have a horrible horrible sweet tooth.  I am always on the look out for a great ice cream/ frozen yogurt place.  Decided to give Millie's a try and I was not disappointed.  First, if you look on their website you can see the ingredients of most of the ice creams you will encounter at the store, this trend likewise carries over to their store where the ingredients are listed under the ice cream title.  Second, love the atmosphere. As you ascend the stairs to this quaint little place, you almost go back in time.  The interior is rather retro and you get to really take a look around as you wait in the inevitable line.  I ended up getting the salted caramel, which was super creamy and smooth.  Unfortunately, this ice cream is REALLLLLLY salty.  I love salt but i couldn't finish this one.  Even so, the ice cream was excellent and next time ill be trying something on the chocolate spectrum.  You can bet I'll be back...in fact I may as well step up my cardio game in preparation ha ha.  Update! So since my previous review I have tried a few flavors: 1.  Honey Bourbon: This is my absolute flavor.  It is a light hint of honey with. mild flavor of bourbon, nothing too sweet or overwhelming.  Its just a nice refreshing soft cool flavor for a warm evening.   2.  Chocolate:  No joke, this is super chocolatey.  Unfortunately when I tried it...it was late evening and they literally had to scrape the bottom of the barrel... As such, my ice cream was kind of grainy and chalky... but I'm sure its better as long as they don't scrape the bottom for you. I'll keep you guys updated as I continue my stroll this enviable path of indulgence.",

They are slightly buttery, warm...heaven on earth, if you will.  I had the salted caramel ice cream. It was perfection.

We also tried the ricotta pistachio luxardo cherry, which seemed to have some orange zest in it as well (allergy sufferers, beware--it wasn't listed). I was disappointed that the ricotta flavor was quite mild, but the waffle cones were excellent and we'll definitely be back. Both concoctions could have benefited from a colder freezer--it was barely 50 degrees outside and we had soupy ice cream within a few minutes.   Millie's also suffers from the same problem as the previous tenant--the shape of the shop is long and deep, and so the logical place for the counter means that people trying to leave have to walk through the line. The space would benefit from some stanchions or something similar to keep the line in check.  Bonus points for having plentiful tap water and selling Lactaid pills ($0.50 each)--genius!",

As for the ice cream flavors go, most of them are incredible, but some are a bit weird like Szechuan peach. The huge handmade waffle cones pack a ton of flavor. I love their ice cream and I will keep on returning for more.",

    "text": "We stopped at Millie's on one of the first warm Saturday nights of the season and weren't sure what to think when we saw a line going out the door. Should we go somewhere else? How long would we wait if we stayed? We decided to get in line and it moved very quickly. The employees inside were super efficient in keeping things moving. Once we got near the door we were greeted by the sweet smell of Millie's freshly made waffle cones. It smelled so delicious. I opted for the Thai tea flavor in a junior size ($4) which is one scoop and a waffle cone (+$1). The Thai tea tastes just like the real thing from my favorite Thai restaurants. The perfect blend of tea flavor and milky sweetness. They also put a few mini marshmallows at the bottom of the cone that melt and make for a delicious last bite.",

For example, I know of nowhere else that has Vietnamese coffee ice cream, and it is definitely one of the best flavors they have, with a much stronger roast flavor than traditional coffee but also traced with condensed milk throughout. You can be more adventurous and try flavors like fig or spiced prune, which may not sound appetizing as ice cream but they really make it tasty and unique. They usually have some sorbets as well, whose textures are creamier than sorbets elsewhere and are pretty close to ice cream. A delicious tropical one is the coconut lime, which is light but zesty.",

The price was right for a specialty flavored ice cream shop and the portions were very generous, but the flavor didn't wow me like I was hoping.

You can taste any of the flavors. They are all made and served fresh. After reading the menu I knew what I wanted-no tasting needed. I wasn't sure I wanted a waffle cone so imagine how thrilled I was to find out one of the toppings is waffle cone pieces. It was perfect. I had a scoop of The Very Best and a scoop of Hazelnut. The chocolate was very good. It tasted like the fudge pops we are as a kid. I wasn't thrilled with the Hazelnut until I realized there were actual hazelnuts in the ice cream. The crunch from the nuts and waffle cone pieces were s great added touch.  I love the whole pink theme. It's also nice that they have seating out front, inside, and in the back outside. I can't wait to bring friends to try it.",

There is only one other kind of ice cream I crave this much and that is homemade ice cream from my friend who is a pastry chef. Most recently, I had white chocolate plum in a waffle cone. The ice cream had massive chunks of plums in it and it is so creamy! The waffle cones are made fresh there and they are delicious; my boyfriend thinks they are too sweet but I disagree.

The ice cream I went with was almond butter it reminded me of my mothers almond butter cake. Soo good. The hazelnut I mixed with ended up being not as good as I thought in the beginning. The waffle cone was made fresh as well. I even got to taste a flavor they ran out of which was awesome. The Vietnamese coffee. Seriously through the sherbet was fantastic. Enjoy",

I've met the owner before and he was beyond friendly, I can't believe this is how he wants his business represented.  Her job is to deal with customers and she failed. Upon leaving my fiance informed me that Dana always gets an attitude when you ask to sample a flavor. This is unacceptable from anyone who deals with customers but especially a manager.

    "text": "Good tasting ice cream.  Not \"the best in the world\" as some of the other reviewers would have you believe but it is perfectly good tasting.  The line was a pretty long wait, and I think the main reason for this is that one of the workers seemed to be doing all the work, while the other 2 workers were just standing in the back talking to each-other the whole time I was there.  Maybe if they helped out the line would move quicker.  I had to wash my hands twice because the counter where you pay was sticky and my ice cream toppings were overflowing and unavoidably made my hands sticky.  But a problem is there is no hand dryer or paper towels to dry your hands in the bathroom.  Also pretty expensive, it was $7.49 for a Sundae $2.75 for a small bottle of water (the bottle of water was also sticky too).  I would have taken a picture of the receipt but they said they ran out of receipt paper.  They said they ran out of several of the toppings also.  It's kind of a neat quirky place tho, like the ice cream scoop door knobs, and a very simple menu with unique flavors and they say it's all home made and from local farmers and stuff.  It just didn't live up to all the hype for me.",

It's disappointing from such a popular place. I hope the owners are planning on making changes to become more inclusive.   I was craving a big ole scoop of vanilla. I didn't think I needed to try it before ordering. After, I regretted my decision. Who takes vanilla ice cream and decides that they need to add SALT. It wasn't terrible, but it was very unpleasant. I ended up tossing it after a few bites. Due to this experience, I will not be returning.  I would recommend trying it but don't bring your family members or friends with disabilities.",

One of those let's-go-here-and-it-never-happened things. Until the Open Streets event in Point Breeze where I experienced the Vietnamese coffee and ohmygawd I have not gotten over it. I don't know how they make it so delicious but if you love, even LIKE, coffee, this is a must try.   I have been back a few times and had the coffee and vegan chocolate (creature of habit). I did branch out once when they had blueberry pancake and it rocked my world. What really sent me over the edge was when I bit into a chunk of ACTUAL PANCAKE AND SYRUP that apparently came directly from Square Cafe. Shut. UP. It was like a dream. Millie's has taught me to try more new things in my life.  So if you're into ice cream that gives you all the feels, go here. Don't be afraid of the line, either. IT IS WORTH IT.",

I love that they have dairy free options for vegans and those who can't eat dairy. This night I chose the dairy free chocolate and boy was It good! Tasted exactly like normal ice cream and the waffles cones are delicious!! Big fan! And the little marshmallows at the bottom to stop It from leaking is so smart! As well, you can purchase lactaid pills at this shop by the register for 50 cents! Very inclusive towards people who may have forgotten a pill! The shop itself is small but they have tables outside to sit on. When's it's busy towards the time after dinner there's not much room to sit but you can walk along the street and check out the other stores and restaurants!",

I may or may not have strategically planned mine and my boyfriend's anniversary dinner so that we were within walking distance of Millie's...Anyway, this is a must-go for ice cream during any PGH visit. I was delighted to find out that they had olive oil in-house that day - this is my absolute favorite Millie's flavor and I only see it on the menu every once in a while! The creaminess of the oil makes for such a smooth ice cream, and the sweetness of the scoop is cut by the oil, which makes it nearly impossible to put down. I paired this with the new Scoop Shop, which is a sweet cream ice cream with peanuts, sprinkles, cherries, waffle cones, caramel, and fudge - how can you go wrong! The pairing of the not-as-sweet olive oil with the super sweet (but fantastic) scoop shop was excellent and left me wanting even more. Long story short, Millie's is awesome and every Pittsburgher and visitor needs to try the deliciousness.",

You might be wondering who Chad is and what makes his vanilla so spectacular. Well, Chad is the chef/ice cream maker and you'll have to ask him what kind of magic he is using, because I have no idea. To my uncultured palate, this vanilla seems to be salted just a bit more than most vanilla ice creams.  Maybe that's what makes it so special?

I am often skeptical of citrus flavors, but this one was bright and summery while still have a smooth creamy texture.

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night and the line was out the door! I absolutely loved my first few licks of the ice cream, but not so much for the last few licks, making this very hard for me to decide on an appropriate rating for Millie's. The ice cream flavors are so creative and they're flavors you usually don't find anywhere else. The hubby and I got Vietnamese Coffee and Thai Iced Tea flavors and they were both to die for until we got halfway into them and we were just so sick of the sugar overload. We also opted for the waffle cone ($1 extra) which added even more sweetness to our already super sweet scoops. I will say, though, the flavors we had were on point; tasted exactly like Vietnamese coffee and Thai tea! However, just a bit too rich after a while. The hubby usually cannot get enough of ice cream but he couldn't finish his cone at Millie's. Unfortunately, him and I both wasted some ice cream which was a shame because they were absolutely delicious. You probably don't hear this much, but perhaps a smaller portion would make the delicious flavors more enjoyable.   It's definitely spacious in here with both indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is bright and fresh and the workers are friendly, patient and helpful. Overall, I would come here again and again no matter how long the line was, but maybe do without the waffle cone to cut down my sugar intake ever so slightly.",

That said, if reviews were based solely on smells, Millie's would win. When you walk into Millie's, the first thing you notice is the smell. It smells like cookies baking, thanks to the waffle cones they cooking behind the counter. The clean and tasteful interior will not go unnoticed as well. With pink striped walls, white subway tiles, and a compelling smell, you feel like you are in an ice cream shop! As far as ice cream goes, it is very good, especially the peanut brittle which tastes like a peanut butter cookie. I do wish they had more options for flavors, or stocked up better. My second visit I went around 7:00, only to find they were out of two flavors and almost out of one. Lack of flavors beside, the best part of Millie's was the waffle cones- you cannot go to Millie's without trying one! Their heavenly waffle cones taste like cookies, and are probably the best I have ever ate.  To make the experience even more delightful, the staff was helpful and friendly. Millie's was definitely worth a second trip, and will be worth a third.",

A few days ago I ordered the gingerbread ice cream in a waffle cone and it compelled me to happily hand over 5 stars.   This place is great because they let you try any and all of the flavors -- which you'll need to do because: 1) the pressure to pick \"the one\" (or two..?) is something you don't want to screw up and 2) the flavor combinations are sometimes bizarre until you try them and you're like omghowisthisnotalreadyaflavor.   I urge you to stand in the line no matter how long it is because it is worth it. On top of that, thanks for showing love to the lactose intolerant (you can purchase lactaid pills) and for making a self-serving water station easily accessible. The staff is always helpful and in \"all hands on deck mode.\"  And a very cute note: I used the restroom and there is a coat hanger for adults and then one low enough for children. (Awwwww.)",

They had a very natural homemade flavor which is hard to find nowadays, not too sweet and accurate to what they're mimicking. Our only complaint was the ice cream was almost not cold enough and started melting almost immediately even on a cold drizzly day. The texture while rich was not the creamiest nor did it had live that slightly chewy texture you find in certain ice cream parlors like Tofts or Eric's Irresistable Ice Cream in Ohio. Overall though my wife and I really like this place and plan on coming back!",

The lines can get long, but to me that just shows how good it is. It's truly unfortunate for my diet that their new location in Market Square is a 5 minute walk from my office.",

The store has about 9 available flavors, from standard chocolate, vanilla, coffee to some more exotic pear sherbet and ricotta cherry. You can order junior ($3) small ($4) or large ($5) and add a waffle cone for $1. I got a small which had two sizable scopes of vanilla and the BEST chocolate . The vanilla was a bit rich for me but the chocolate had a more subtle sweetness. The waffle cone was perfectly crispy and thick! I highly recommend. They also have floats and sundaes available.   Think next time I'll get a junior as I was sugar overloaded by the end. I'd also try some of their more subtle less rich flavors like the sherbet. Also would love some outdoor seating in front. Will def be back in a nice day!",

The ice cream itself is always super fresh and delicious- this time around I tried out the cookie dough, which was AMAZING (as anticipated). I'm also obsessed with their homemade waffle cones!! They have a unique flavor due to the added cinnamon and nutmeg. To prevent melted ice cream from dripping out of the bottom of the cone they place a mini marshmallow before scooping the ice cream.  The shop itself is really nice with indoor and outdoor seating, both out front and in the back. They also have complimentary water and cups at the self service bar equipped with napkins, spoons, etc.   Now go indulge with some Millie's ice cream!!",

There was a line out the door and the outdoor seating area was crowded, which really speaks to how much people love this place.   When you walk in, the divine smell of homemade waffle cones hits you. I rarely order waffle cones, but had to try one after waiting in line and watching an employee make/roll the cones. I opted for the dairy-free mint chocolate chip ice cream and there was no disappointment to be had. I couldn't even tell that my ice cream was missing the dairy component! For those who go full dairy, the shop sells Lactaid for 50 cents, which is genius.   Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Millie's and will be back with more friends in tow.

The beauty of it is you smell the freshly made waffle cones blocks away. So warm and inviting. The place is cute and clean. Seats are available inside and outside. The ladies selling the ice cream were always nice. Flavors keep changing and were always good. I like gelato more than ice cream. Since I had better gelato in my days (outside the US) I cannot give it five stars. My exotic favorites outside the US mainland are taro, toasted almonds, cactus fruit and whole milk/mastic gum pistachio gelatos. Millie's, here were some ideas for more flavors..

The single scoop is $4.50 and you can split the scoop with two different flavors.

I came in with my Fiance because we had just finished eating Thai food next door and wanted something sweet. I tried the mango, couldn't even finish my spoonful. I was expecting it to be more fruity and it tasted much more creamy and the mango was an after-thought. Tried the Viet Coffee flavor and wondered where the flavor was. My Fiance really liked their peanut butter flavor so he ended up getting that but I left without getting anything. They have maybe 10-12 flavors available and none of them sounded very appetizing to me after trying the first 2.   Honestly have had better ice cream many other places. Maybe I'll have to go in when they have different flavors available.",

Vietnamese coffee is my all time favorite flavor (sweet and minimally bitter) but the peanut butter is a close second (it has nuts and chocolate chips in it that add to the nutty flavor)!!  I also appreciate that they have gluten free cones now and some vegan options as well!!",

    "text": "I have to say, after all the amazing reviews, I also have to join the minority in saying that I wasn't very impressed with Millie's. There was a short line when we came on a hot summer night but it moved quickly. They list all the flavors on the board facing you as you stand in line so you have plenty of time to make a decision. They do give you samples if you ask for it! I tried the peanut butter and the mint, can't say I liked either of them. The peanut butter tasted a bit too salty and the mint was creamy, but a bit bland. I ended up ordering two small scoops of mint and coffee in a cone. Didn't want to hold up the line and try anymore. The coffee was way sweet and ended up being monotonous after the first few bites. I tried the rest of the fam's flavors and the mango gelato was pretty good. The blueberry sorbet was way tart but refreshing. The best thing about this place was the freshly made waffle cones! I liked the strong cinnamon and spices you can taste in the cone. They were crispy and on the thinner side so didn't feel like it was too much. But at $26 for 4 people, it's a bit steep for mediocre ice cream! I've had better - the flavors need to stand out and be a bit stronger! Plus for it being right next to Noodlehead though cause it makes a good dinner/dessert option!",

    "text": "\"O-M-G! No wonder they have such good Yelp reviews!\" exclaimed my ice cream loving 6 year old after just one bite. I was thinking similar thoughts after a bite of their salted cookie dough ice cream. I had recently had cookie dough ice cream at my favorite ice cream shop near my house, shoutout to Graeters. I have to admit that Ms. Millie could teach Mr. Graeter about how to make a good cookie dough ice cream because this one was truly 5 stars.  Our 7pm Saturday night arrival was just perfect because we walked right in. 20 minutes later we were leaving and the line was out the door, although ice cream this good may be worth waiting in line for.   It would be hard to order anything besides the salted cookie dough flavor now that I\"ve tasted it, but I bet all their flavors are delicious. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh and hope that Millie finds her way to Chicago one day!",

You think you'll just have something small, but then the flavors are all interesting, the samples satisfying and I end up with a homemade waffle cone and two flavors. Oh well, I can always practice self-control somewhere else.   I absolutely love the Vietnamese Coffee, but then there is always another flavor that is interesting that I add because I have yet to try it. This past weekend I wanted to try the choc chip cookie dough. It was salted and such a great balance with their vanilla ice cream.    There is also something about the music they have playing that just makes it a great time hanging out with your friends, no matter what time of year it is.

The atmosphere is bright as light reflex off the white walls which always pours me in a cheery mood.   The ice cream itself is delectable. Sweet but not overpowering with different/ new flavors all the time. My current favorite/ what's pictured below is the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Millie's is pretty gracious with their cookie dough pieces. I typically get one scoop because of my semi diet up I couple eat 2 or 3 scoops in a sitting.   I would also recommend as a post dinner dessert place(especially in the summer when you can sit outside on the benches)",

When I came in I was at an annoying person who had to try at least three flavors before I settled on one. And I was trying to set a good example for the kids that I was babysitting and only getting one scoop because it was before dinner and I really regretted my choice. That coconut lime was delicious and I wish I had three scoops.  I'm looking forward to coming back to Millie's again because I have two people visiting Pittsburgh soon and I am going to take them here just to get my fix of that coconut lime. I will dream about it until then.  And I will say a shout out to the staff who always accommodates the nut allergy for the one child that I babysit and we'll go in the back to scoop his ice cream. I really appreciate the understanding in the thoughtfulness of a company that will go out of their way and their workflow in order to help keep a child safe. Even if he continues to tell me that his reaction is not that bad I will continue to ask for his to be scooped in the back.",

Having heard it was the cool new ice cream shop in town, I suggested that we check it out, given that my friend and I are both diehard ice cream aficionados.  As usual, my friend was game, so we headed over to Highland Ave. to check out the goods.  After sampling some other flavors, I decided to go with scoops of the peanut butter and dark chocolate on brioche ($7), and my friend decided to get the salted caramel and \"the best\" dark chocolate in a bowl ($4).  The brioche was much larger than expected, and came toasted from the panini press.  Its warmth made for a nice contrast to the cold ice cream, and its lightness and sweetness complemented the ice cream nicely.  While I wouldn't get it every time I get ice cream, it was something interesting and different and made for a nice extra treat.  As for the ice cream itself, it was delectable and clearly high-quality.  Its texture was smooth and its flavors were delicious, with detectable bits of chocolate and caramel.  My only complaint is that \"the best\" chocolate melted rather quickly, suggesting that it wasn't frozen at a cold enough temperature.  The flavors were creative, and ranged from the classic (dark chocolate, peanut butter) to the unusual (orange poppy seed).  Needless to say, my friend and I are fans.  Although she's leaving town and won't be back until mid-July, I can say for sure that I'll be back for more as the weather warms up!",

    "text": "Stopped in on Saturday after a lunch at Noodlehead. The decor is very classic ice cream parlor - perhaps a tad overwhelming.  There are not many flavors, but they are interesting ones! They let me taste as many as I wanted. I settled on spiced rum and banana and dried fig. At $4, two scoops is definitely worth it (a single scoop is $3).  The rum flavor was very much overpowered by the banana, but I still enjoyed it. The dried fig flavor was spot. on.   I should say that I don't eat ice cream often. Why? I am lactose intolerant, and ice cream makes me unpleasant to be around. However, Millie's saved the day for me: they have single servings of lactaid pills for 50 cents each. Hurray!",

We probably go here once a week (it's thrown a wrench in our summer dieting plans :)   Because Millie's is all natural, when they create a flavor, IT ACTUALLY TASTE LIKE THAT FLAVOR. Imagine: Peppermint Brownie, Lavender, Goat's Milk Blueberry, Coco Nut Lime, Strawberry Rhubarb. ALL made from real ingredients. Not some fake artificial non-scene that we have come to accept as normal.    But don't get scared away by the exotic flavors. Chad's Vanilla is possibly the best vanilla I've ever tasted. There is always a good Caramel, Chocolate, and Peanut Butter option to choose from as well.    Hands down the best. So happy Millie's is here!!!",

Subtle flavors this go around, and the waffle cone was great, not overcooked this time.  Original Review: 3 Stars Finally got around to stopping here after going to dinner down the street, and glad we did. Pretty long line for a Saturday so I felt a little pressured to order quickly, and only tried 2 flavors (Thai Iced Tea and Coconut Lime). Thai Iced Tea had too strong of an anise flavor so I opted for the latter as it was a unique combo.  The texture was different, and presumably they used coconut milk to make the base, but it was refreshing, not too heavy. The smell inside was intoxicating but I didn't find myself loving the waffle cone. It was good, but there are better options in Pittsburgh.  The spot itself is beautifully remodeled and the staff was very pleasant, and the costs were reasonable. I hope to stop back soon and find a flavor I love, but still recommend the visit as it was satisfying overall.",

They also had a delicious chocolate ice cream that I tried and will have to get next time. My boyfriend had Vietnamese coffee (dairy-full) and said it was amazing. Neither of us generally get a cone but this was well worth it. The handmade waffle cones both smelled and tasted amazing! Great for dairy and non-dairy lovers alike. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Plus it's by noodlehead so it's a win/win.",

I suppose that's putting a lot of pressure on the ice cream to be as good as it looks in a tiny cropped photo on Instagram but it did not disappoint!   I ordered the Butter Pecan on a waffle cone and LOVED it. The portion for a small was huge! My son got a small cup of vanilla and he went to town on it! I've never seen him eat so much ice cream (actually I took him to a chain ice cream shop recently and he barely touched his cup of vanilla). It all tasted so fresh and real! I'm eager to try some other flavors.   And I really loved the decor! Every spot was picture perfect, from the cone on the stairs at the entry way to the mural behind the counter. The staff wore cute shirts that made it feel so old fashioned. For an ice cream shop it was pretty idyllic and sometimes you just need that little escape from reality!",

I discovered it when I wandered into their soft opening by accident and struck at gold in the form of a fabulous ice cream cone - flavor ricotta and berry?!  So good!  The second time I went was on Easter when it was closed and there were at least 3 other couples that also stood disappointed in front of its closed doors.  Since then I have taken every chance to go there!  The flavors change frequently and there are always a few unique ones.   My recommendation - get some noodlehead next door for dinner and end the night with Millie's!",

    "text": "Great addition to Shadyside! They do the light subtle flavors best, overwhelmed by the richer ones and the waffle cone was weirdly soft, lacked a good crunch throughout (some people may like this).  Loved the ice cream texture- did not have any issues with it being too soft like another reviewer noted- it has a nice bite to it.  We took advantage of the very generous amt of sample tries from their ceramic tasting spoons (so fancy).  Banana rum - my favorite, banana really shone through! Orange poppyseed- hubby got this and we enjoyed the creative flavor combo, tasted like a yummy poppyseed pastry Vietnamese coffee- strong coffee notes but somehow did not wow me Pistachio (mixed with something)- delicate light and delicious Salted caramel- went on a whim and got a whole scoop of this without sampling because it got good reviews- total mistake. The caramel is so overwhelming and rich I almost felt sick and couldn't taste anything past the first bite, it was a tragedy but i ended up \"sacrificing\" the rest of the scoop into a trash can (unreal if you know me) just so I could enjoy the rest of my cone (filled with the banana winning flavor).  I will say the waffle cone $1 is a great way to up your ice cream volume but I was disappointed by the cone texture. Very weirdly soft and bendy on the inside. Not the crunch I was looking for.  I am giving this 4 stars because it is generally excellent artisan ice cream that usually hits the spot and fills an ice cream gap on the burgh!",

Fresh waffle cones were divine too! So glad this place had opened, and just in time for summer!",

When my partner and I go, we like to both get two different flavors in our waffle cones and try all four. I can't get past making at least one \"the very best chocolate\" but we've had the lavender, goats milk blueberry (oh so good), the Vietnamese coffee, thai tea (alsoo so good) - needless to say: we've tried a lot. Never disappointing and has the added value of never knowing what you're going to get when you walk in- something could pop up on the menu you've never seen before and sounds even better than the rest.   The place itself is adorable, but they had me at ice cream.",

Seeing and smelling them made in-house made the experience all the more enticing.   While it is a small store space, it is family friendly. The bathroom was very clean and had a changing station (which is a big deal for families with small kids). And also kid-friendly menu options as the \"junior\" size cone or bowl is one scoop - which is perfect for the 5year old.  Highly recommended as this was the best ice cream we've had in Pittsburgh.",

After sampling a few flavors, I decided on a scoop of strawberry rhubarb pie and a scoop of lemon. The strawberry rhubarb pie was absolutely AMAZING. It was perfectly creamy with fresh pieces of fruit and chunks of pie crust hidden in there. You can tell that they use really high quality ingredients for their ice cream.

It's a nice little walk from home on a spring/summer day for a cone or dish.",

    "text": "Millie's knows how to do ice cream. Prepare yourself for a sugar rush because this is not for the faint of heart. Their ice cream is very heavy and rich in flavor so a couple spoonfuls will leave an average person more than satisfied. The line is always long and crawling out the door, but it gives me some extra time to decide which flavor I want - a decision not to be taken lightly.   The waffle cone is deeeelicious! There really is no other acceptable way to eat ice cream than in a waffle cone. It takes the experience to another level.   Let's talk ice cream!! The \"Best\" Chocolate has a darker taste to it. VERY sweet and rich. You'll feel like you're eating pure sugar - in the best way possible, of course. It's definitely one of my favorites. Being Vietnamese myself, I couldn't pass up the Vietnamese Coffee flavored ice cream. However, I was SO disappointed because it tasted like any generic coffee ice cream you can find in a store. If you're going to put \"Vietnamese\" on your product, I expect results!   Overall, delicious ice cream! I will definitely be back again - probably more times than I'll be proud to admit.",

You don't often see lemon in an ice cream (as opposed to sorbet). The texture was so smooth!  I appreciate that you can get a single scoop for $3.  I love ice cream but sometimes I just don't feel like eating a giant portion, especially if I'm getting dessert after a meal. It would also be the perfect amount for a kid! And if you want a more normal sized serving, two scoops is only $4.50, which is about typical for premium ice cream.  From reading reviews I now know that they offer regular sugar cones as well, but it seemed like everyone was getting a freshly made waffle cone. The smell certainly is tempting! You can also get ice cream sandwiched in a brioche bun.  They rotate their flavors pretty often based on what is in season, and they seem to usually offer a sorbet or two for the vegans. You can always check their website to see what they are currently scooping, but I'm sure you couldn't go wrong!",

Pink and white, a fireplace, and a cute mural on the wall. Every time I go there is literally a line out the door and I'm never upset about it. It's worth the wait! And the wait is never very long.  The staff is always so pleasant and let's you sample the many unique flavors. My favorites include the Vietnamese coffee and the best chocolate. Mmm. Mmm. I've also have a few ice cream cakes made by them and each one was so unique and delicious.   Also, the smell of the homemade waffle cones as you walk through the door is incredible.

    "text": "Walking into Mille's I had the feeling of being in an modern day ice cream parlor. They have wooden benches where you can sit on a rainy or cold day as was the day of my visit or take out. You can also purchase pints to take home with you.  They have 12 different ice cream and sorbet offerings. You get to sample them on miniature plastic spoons unlike the throw away versions you get at other shoppes.  I was really impressed with that. The owner and manager told me that they are one of two ice cream stores that completely make their ice cream from scratch including pasteurization.  There standard favorites are rich chocolate and lemon sorbet. While I sampled both I was leaning more towards the dark chocolate which is my favorite type of chocolate and butter pecan. You can get your ice cream in either a waffle cone or up. Juniors start at $3.00, whereas small is $4.00 plus tax.  Yes you get two scoops with the small and you can select two different flavors for your scoops. So I ordered the dark chocolate and the butter pecan. They were both out of this world good!!   The staff was very friendly and helpful. They do have recycling in addition to your regular trash. The only setback is parking which tends to be a problem in that area but if you can park on a nearby side street during the day then you should not have too much trouble.   I asked how often they change out the flavors and was told about every two weeks or so. But they will always have their standard favorites if you want them. Coffee is also available for purchase. This will be my new go to place whenever I'm in the East Liberty area again.",

    "text": "About a year and a half ago or so I read an article in Pittsburgh Magazine about this amazing ice cream CSA that would deliver pints of artisanal ice cream directly to your door.  It sounded too good to be True.  I immediately went to their website and signed up for the first of many.  Thus my love affair with Millie's Homemade Ice Cream was born.  From the very first delivery of Lemon Verbena, I melted with delight.  I enjoyed getting to try some of Chad's creations over the year (including Paw Paw, Mint Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Chicory, and Spumoni ice cream along with some great sorbets like Rhubarb and Arnold Palmer).  And to make it even better, the owners themselves (Chad and Lauren) were the ones who made the deliveries!  Every time I would greet one of them at the door we would talk about the previous flavors and they would tell me a bit about the new flavors.  It's exciting enough when someone brings you ice cream but this was a whole other level of customer service backing an amazing product.  When I heard they finally had a space to open up a scoop shop, I had mixed emotions.  Happy that they were able to realize their dream but also sad for myself that I now had to get my own ice cream.  Their new shop in Shadyside is a wonderful exhibit of their product.  It's simple yet unique.  A playful mural shows the stops along the way in the making Millie's Homemade Ice Cream.  They use local seasonal ingredients so the flavors will rotate making each trip to Millie's a whole new experience.  And even when the flavors are more complex, the ingredients are not.  I would always laugh while eating my CSA pints when I noticed how few ingredients are listed.  They've hired a small team of enthusiastic local college and high school students to man the scoops.  The kids seem to have learned quickly how to make a fresh waffle cone or panini up some brioche.  Yes, brioche.  The short menu at Millie's includes your scoops, your waffle cones, a few sundaes, floats....and brioche.  It's an idea Lauren told me they got at Epcot's French section where they put ice cream on a brioche bun and place it in a special panini press.  I had the orange marmalade with poppy ice cream on mine, quite possibly the best flavor combination.  I also had a waffle cone with Vietnamese Coffee and Dark Chocolate (made with Hop Farm Brewing's Fresh Pot of Porter) - another magical flavor combination.  Floats are made with Red Ribbon's root or birch beer.  They have a few pints for sale at the register, too, just in case you can't leave empty handed.  There is no limit on samples so be sure to taste as much as you'd like before deciding.  One current flavor is a coconut lime sorbet that is very refreshing.  There were several large water pitchers strategically located around the shop so it's not necessary to bother the staff for a drink.  I also noticed Lactaid for sale - it's like they thought of everything!  Inside there are a few tables and a bar for sitting as well as some counter space along the wall.  There is an outdoor deck that will be nice once the weather warms up.    I'm so happy for their success and proud to have been a support since the CSA program.  Pictures I've seen from the first few days show long lines out the door.  Please don't let that discourage you.  There's a reason you might have to wait.  I'd give Millie's 10 stars if I could.",

They offer unique flavors that you can't get anywhere else, and even the typical flavors that are common have some sort of twist on it or are just plain amazing. One of my personal favorites here is the Vietnamese Coffee, which has the perfect amount of sweet and coffee blended together. The lavender is also really good, if you're going for something that's a little lighter.  Millie's is located near a bunch of other restaurants, so if you have room for dessert (which you always do), head over to treat yourself.",

I'm not remotely vegan, but I love dark chocolate ice cream, so I tried the vegan dark chocolate on my first trip to Millie's over a year ago and it's still my favorite ice cream on the planet to this day. It's creamy and has a dark chocolate flavor that's rich without being heavy or sickeningly sweet. I've tried a few other iconic local chains in and out of Pittsburgh like the Milk Shake Factory and Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, and I think Millie's takes the cake. Nevertheless, if you're a Millie's virgin, I would warn that the line can be nuts and some of my friends are less taken with Millie's than I am. One of my friends thought the texture was too icy, and based on taste-testing other flavors, it seems like there's a little variation in iciness versus creaminess based on the flavor. Even so, I personally think Millie's is a must try if you're a fan of ice cream!",

    "text": "Millie's is one of the greatest ice cream places in Pittsburgh. The place has a bright, homey, and welcoming decor, which is only emphasized by the homemade ice cream. The quality of the custard here is top notch, and each flavor's ingredients are explicitly listed so you'll know what you're eating. In my opinion, the waffle cones here do not match up to the ones at Dave & Andy's but the ice cream at Millie's is superior. My squad had \"The Best Hot Chocolate,\" \"Salted Caramel,\" and \"Mint Chocolate.\" All fantastic, the but chocolate was the most notable. My only critique was that the Mint Chocolate was not as frozen as the other flavors, and was too wet. Check my photos.  Seriously, Millie's is located among other great Pittsburgh eateries. Finish up your meal, and don't forget to stop by this Grade-A establishment for a summery dessert. If you're not eating a meal but want an excuse for something sweet, go here. Actually, just go here. You won't regret it.",

Staff was friendly and allowed me to get 2 flavors for a junior size even though the sign indicated 1.   I ordered lavender and thai tea, which were great together. If you've had actual thai tea, you know it is very strong and sweet, which is what I was expecting, but the flavor was much more subtle and just enough. Highly recommend!",

We kept thinking they were working out kinks and then the final time, I took my sisters who were charmed by the adorable exterior and craving ice cream.  My sister enthusiastically bit into her salted caramel in a waffle cone and said it was good though it couldn't compare to Jeni's of Nashville where my sister is a local.  Then a few minutes later, her face soured and she said she had an unpleasant greasy mouth coating like the one I'd experienced.  She noted later, that she could not get rid of the coating and how icky it was.  I don't know if Millie's is thinking a ridiculously high fat content will prove addictive but, it ends up feeling like eating a stick of frozen butter.  Not creamy, but flaky and greasy and the horrible mouth coating dulls the flavor which is the only pleasant part of the experience.  The waffle cone was great the first time, but slightly burnt the next so less pleasant and I found half my sister's cone in my car trash bin later.",

Millie's is the best ice cream and sorbet that I've ever had, hands down. Millie's has turned me into an ice cream snob, and I just CAN'T have any other ice cream. Their homemade waffle cones are THE BEST (look for a marshmallow at the bottom of the yummy cone) and the warm brioche ice cream sandwiches are TO DIE FOR!! I'm salivating as I write this.

With the exception of some staples -- including the decadent chocolate, which is probably the best chocolate ice cream that I've ever had -- the flavors are constantly changing and there's always some interesting flavors. I've found that the creamy ice creams are better then the sherbets. A small size is two scoops and a regular is three, and you can mix and match the flavors for each scoop. Prices are reasonable given the quality of the ice cream.",

Edit after 1 year: the fact that the owner is secretly tagging the reviews as \"funny\" doesn't make a big difference. It is not ice cream, it is candy that looks like ice cream.",
