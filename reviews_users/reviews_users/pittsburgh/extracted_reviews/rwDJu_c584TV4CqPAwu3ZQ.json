Hung out here for about two and a half hours over a drink and dinner. Crab cakes portion size looks disappointing for $19, but were surprisingly filling and very good. Drink of choice for the night was an Old Fashioned-- can't truly comment on how it was because I'm definitely not an avid whiskey drinker and had no idea if it was good or not. It tasted like I was taking a shot with every sip? Don't know if that helps.   The backroom was totally dead by 10 on a Friday, but the front was full of people. Would come back again for drinks (probably would skip the food) with a DD so I could fully enjoy their drink selection.",

Came in on a Monday evening, unfortunately they weren't serving food, which was half the reason we ended up at Carmella's. The good news is that the bar completely made up for it. They have their own infused vodka, and the bartender was more than willing to make up a drink around what kind of vodka I wanted. I hear their thing is the moscow mule, but never got a chance to try it.   The ambiance is pretty cool, very laid back and relaxing. Definitely a place to go in Southside if you don't want to end up at Mario's.",

Their selection of beers on tap is strong, and they apparently are specifically known for their fresh fruit infusion in their round house of cocktails.

The day was beautiful, with a warm sun and a light breeze; the windows were wide open and we, of course, grabbed a table on the patio against Carson. There are four two-person tables, and a little cramped if they are all full - but still perfect. Another bonus, there was live entertainment - a very mellow acoustic guitarist, and we loved him. Definitely added to ambiance. We had waters, my friend had a glass of wine. We made it there during their Sunday happy hour - which was awesome. Discounts on food and the drinks. We split the crab avocado dip and the shrimp tacos - and both were delicious, small fares. Towards the end of our visit, around 5, the crowd increased and our waitress really lagged - no refills, no check-ins and it took forever for our checks. But I think she was the only one working the entire crowd, and she was still very pleasant. I'm looking forward to this as a regular hangover recovery spot.",

I was worried because even \"good\" restaurants serve pork chops that taste like I imagine those fire-starter logs taste. What I was served was the way a pork chop was meant to be.  It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. For dessert we had cookies and milk that were clearly baked when ordered and had ALL of the butter in them. Perfect.",

However, I went a third time during restaurant week and was supremely disappointed. 1) I ordered the lamb. The server did not ask how I wanted it cooked and it came out well done. Lamb should be rare or medium rare. 2) I ordered one of the specialty margaritas and it was not strained properly. There were pieces of herbs that were annoyingly going into my mouth and then I kept trying to avoid them while I was drinking...it just wasn't great when you are trying to have a conversation. 3) The chocolate chip cookie for dessert was the worst chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted. It tasted like a health cookie. In other words, it was extremely bland. The two stars is because I did like my appetizer...a prosciutto/ asparagus salad and the drink did actually taste refreshing.",

This place has a fabulous bourbon selection, as super reasonable prices.  To put it in perspective, they had rare pours for almost 1/3 the price of those same pours at Butcher and Rye.

Everything that Carmella's does is put into action like the thoughtful brushstroke of practiced painter.  My choice of meal included the Southside, a cocktail that perfectly marries gin, cucumber and mint to create peak sipability. My entree was the Seared Scallops which included ricotta, flavorful and crispy mushrooms, and English pea risotto. All of the flavors came together as one to allow me to relish in every last bite. Our group also tried an array of appetizers including the Brussel Sprouts, Deviled Eggs, and the Crab and Avocado Dip. I could sing multiple praises for each. The brussels were crispy and flavorful, the deviled eggs were fried and served with a spicy sauce and the crab and avocado dip was addicting. I would recommend trying any of those three.  After I finished I said, and I quote, \"I would invent a time machine right now just to go back to thirty minutes ago and eat that meal again.\" It was a truly fantastic.  The atmosphere is dimly lit and cozy which caters to an intimate evening. The decor is inviting and perfectly suited to the overall character of the space.  I cannot wait to frequent Carmella's time and time again. This has easily taken the top spot on my Pittsburgh favorites list.",

    "text": "This place has great potential because of the location and the ambiance. However, the food is average and overpriced. The cocktails they have on their cocktail menu are also below average and overpriced. I got one of the infused drinks and didn't taste like any alcohol was in the drink at all. Have been coming here over the last few months for brunch and they have gotten a new chef and maybe new management so I'm assuming that's why their menu and portions have changed. Ordered the prime rib sandwich they gave THREE duck fries with the sandwich which looked like a child could've finished the whole dish which was $15 for a very small plate. If you want something that's a bang for your buck.. the Carmela's breakfast is the go too. I really do like this place honestly and that's why I've come back.. but after today's experience I'm not sure i will. Just wish the portions were bigger for the prices they charge otherwise the quality is there!",

It tasted amazing and was seasoned perfectly. The fingerling potatoes and peppers were great! Definitely check this place out for sure!",

It's great on a warm night to be able to sit in their sidewalk seating area and cozy to sit around the fireplace for brunch on a cold winter day. I've visited for brunch, happy hour, dinner, and late night drinks and all have been enjoyable. They have a big draught selection and the wine on tap has some delicious varieties.   I have had the chili and the hamburger from the dinner menu, and both were delightful.  The breakfast sandwich on the brunch menu is a winner. Couple that with a mimosa and you are off to a great Saturday!",

Service is just what I like, educated about the menu, around when you need them and not too overbearing.  Drinks are creative and delicious.  I love their Moscow Mule.  Dinner is awesome!  I've been to both Meat & Potatoes and Butcher & Rye, which have a similar vibe, and this is just as good if not better.  The meat and cheese platter is stacked with great options and I seriously still dream about the scallop and risotto dish.    Only reason I docked them a star was I tried brunch recently.  Their brunch menu is new, but could use some work.  I got baked eggs and they were BAKED and not in a good way, just way overcooked.  Friend got the Biscuits and Gravy which was huge, but nothing amazing.  I just think their are better brunch spots in Pittsburgh.  Mimosa and Bloody Mary's were good though!  Overall, skip brunch until they get the menu worked out.  Definitely go for dinner and drinks.  Still dreaming of the scallops...",

I had someone recommend Carmella's to me for dinner one time and I didn't think much of it, but we were looking for a brunch spot and after seeing some rave reviews on here, we decided to give it a shot.  Five of us had a reservation on a Sunday afternoon at 1230.  We chose to sit in the back dining area, although the front bar area had some cool high-top tables.  The back dining room is bright and ski-lodgeish.  Does not look like somewhere that would belong in the SouthSide, but was a pleasant surprise and nice change either way.  We started with drinks around the table - a couple bloody marys, mimosas, a mojito and an oyster shooter.  Everyone in the group was pleased.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, while still giving us space to chat and catch up with each other.  I ordered the crab cake benedict which came with their cheesy potatoes and the others ordered the crabcake BLT, frittata, and salmon omelette (on special).  Everyone loved their food!! My crabcake benedict was absolutely incredible and the cheesy potatoes even better.  The price was standard - fell in line with your typical brunch price around the city.  Overall a really great experience.  I'd totally recommend Carmella's for brunch and I would imagine their lunch and dinner is just as good.  Can't wait to come back!",

We had already eaten dinner so we didn't order food, but the table in the back with the fireplace was open and we had a group so we sat around the fireplace and had our beers there. So warm!!  The man checking IDs at the front was friendly and a True character. He ribbed us about our beer selection, but seemed to know a lot about both their beers and their large whiskey selection.  We would definitely go back and have dinner here. It's a refreshing newer spot in the otherwise disappointing Southside.

For my birthday brunch, my friend suggested going to Carmella's for a Sunday brunch because she heard great things about their food. Boy was she right!!   We had reservations for 5 at 12:30, I arrived a little before everyone and sat at the bar and had a mimosa. The bartender was really nice & she served me right away. Once the rest of our crew arrived, the hostess let us pick if we wanted to sit in the bar area, outside, or in the back room. We chose the back room since it seemed more spacious. Once we were seated, we were quickly approached by our waitress to order drinks & fill us in specials. I still had my mimosa, but the rest of the girls got bloody Mary's and the strawberry-kiwi mojioto. My one girlfriends also tried the Oyster Shooter as her drink- which looked interesting but she liked it! Everyone else loved their drinks!!   And not a surprise.. everyone also raved about their brunch! I ordered the fritata special of the day which was spinach, feta, & tomatoes. It was also served with cheesy potatoes-which were probably my favorite part of the meal. The fritata was good but looking at the rest of the meals I wish I got what my friends ordered! Others around the table ordered the breakfast sandwich, crab cake Benedict, and another special which was a crab cake BLT. I look forward to another Brunch date to Carmella's!",

The bar hosts a variety of Whiskeys, Wines (bottle and tap), and beer (local, out of state, draft, and bottle). This is a great change of pace from some of the more specific beer and hard liquor bars on the lane. There is something for everyone here.  The value is there and venue has an open layout with a large window looking out to the street.

It's close to lots of bars if you plan on bar hopping.   They've got a few small tables out on the sidewalk if it's a nice day. The first room you'll walk into houses the bar area. We were seated in the back room and the decor is super cool. Definitely different than your typical restaurant.  Looking around the room you'll see animal heads and antique photos on the walls.   The food menu isn't too extensive. For dinner entrees, there's about 10 options including specials with the minimum costing you about $15. The beer and drink list is much more extensive. I was only drinking beer and each craft will be at least $6. I ended up eating the boar burger which was one of the specials. It's a pork burger topped with bbq pulled pork. I've never had one before and it was delicious. Your mind expects the consistency of a burger but it's a bit tougher and cooked to a different temperature. Check this place out for something different and maybe try one of their specials!",

They have a ton of different liquor and drink options to choose from.  The bartenders are all helpful and provide great service.    The food here is also very good.  While the menu is limited, they make sure to do each dish perfectly.  My favorite thing on the menu is the bison burger.  The ingredients are all fresh and work great together.  The burger is served on a fresh brioche bun which holds up well against the toppings and sauce of the burger.  The burger is always cooked exactly to order as well.

Bartender/server was nice and made us feel welcomed. She also suggested drinks for our next visit after I had mentioned i wasn't familiar with cocktail menu   On my actual birthday we decided to stop in to celebrate restaurant week. Hostesses kindly made sure to fit us in whenever we called ahead. She mentioned a 30 minute wait but we received a text in about 15min. I preferably didn't care for their pre fixe menu and we decided on a small plate..... and then dinner somewhere else.   We were seated around the fireplace which was very different experience but cool. Perfect for january. Service was good as well as the duck tacos I had.  This may be our go to spot when we're looking for something to do, but not an actual club. Wine & Motown? yes please! Not many places on E Carson play Marvin Gaye on a Saturday night.   The crowd was a mix of all ages 25 & older. Cute bar. I intend to experience their brunch soon!!",

This was nice and cozy, but after awhile I had to check to make sure my eyebrows weren't singed off. My face was hot! Decor is eclectic and homey. It's like you're in a fancy mountain cabin.   My restaurant Week picks included: Roasted Onion Soup with Lamb Bacon- this was light, creamy and so very flavorful.   Fried Skate with Heirloom Tomato Salad, Potato Chip Tartar Sauce, Crispy Capers, and Grilled Lemon- this was honestly the best fried fish dish I've ever eaten. The batter was super crispy, but it wasn't greasy at all. The whole dish was actually very light with bright flavors (words I've never used to describe fried food before). Great acid and spice. I'd eat this again and again forever.  Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake with Warm Berry Compote, Caramel Drizzle, Shaved White Chocolate and Candied Garnish- I was a little worried that this was going to be TOO much with a whole 'lotta flavors all over the place. But it was delicious. I love everything lemon and the lemon really shone through. I cleaned my plate with little to no effort.    Portions were perfect, the plating was beautiful, and at 25.17 a person, the restaurant week specials were a fantastic deal. I'll be back to order off the regular menu for sure.",

    "text": "A few months ago, a few friends and I (excluding my best friend) decided to buy tickets to the Hamilton showing in Pittsburgh. We wanted to make this not just a great night, but a night to remember which is weird considering I didn't invite my best friend and soon to be best man, what? Fast forward to the day of the show, we decided to check out a restaurant a friend had recommended to us. That place was you guessed it Carmella's Plates & Pints. (This joke is funny because you obviously knew the name of the restaurant since you were reviewing it)  The food was incredible. It was Restaurant Week and we were able to get a $30 3-course meal that was more worth $60. The salad, the chicken and the pudding dessert left me a satisfied man, and I  admittedly would go back every single week if I lived up in the Pittsburgh area.  On top of the excellent food, the service was phenomenal. Though a busy week for them, the bartender made sure we got our drinks, Carmella herself greeted us (and talked to us multiple times), AND the chef himself paid us a visit. He was so friendly that we even got a picture with him! I  believe he said he was from Haiti, and the four of us were enthralled by his kindheartedness, all in an  accent that sounded Creole (which I believe is form of Spanish or something) The only thing better than the food was Chef Carl's personal touch (literally) Carmella's made this not just a night to remember, but one of the best overall nights I have had in a very long time. Kudos",

    "text": "This place has a heavy, ugly atmosphere that is also cheap - the quality of the wood and its lamination on the tables is waxy.   I've been a few times out of convenience, as I live in the area and it's always empty - the French toast is very big and sweet. The coffee is terribly over-roasted. The waiters are uninformed. Service is slow and unprofessional. The menu is trashwave - unsophisticated takes on sophisticated dishes, for those who like their food at least in part either deeply fried or entirely sugar, served almost warm. I felt it merited a solid 3 stars(for mediocre food and bad atmosphere) until my last visit, where the waitstaff or the waitstaff and kitchen in cahoots delivered to my analysis a new low.  The last time I will have ever been there, I asked if the tacos had any vegetable oil in them. The waiter went to the kitchen, \"to ask the chiefs\", and returned with an answer - \"no.\"  I received my tacos (bland, meatball of some kind, very oily) and took a bite. To my surprise, the meatballs in them were deep fried - I was concerned that a restaurant would be deep-frying only with vegetable oils, because the cost of fruit oils is prohibitive and animal oils(fats like butter, lard) require much higher temperature to melt and create dangers in the kitchen, as well as smoke.    I asked the waiter to check with the kitchen what exactly they were fried in. She returned and supplied another, contradictory answer - \"corn oil.\" The waiters are obviously ignorant, but it seems that if this waiter actually communicated my query to the kitchen, then the cooks are also ignorant. One or both parts of the system make it unsettling to consider being served here if you have any kind of desire to be informed about what you are eating.  I'll never be back. The entire quality of this place is in-your-face cheapness. It's in the components of the foods, it's in the furniture, and it's in the waitstaff.",

We got seated right away and ordered the braised chicken and strawberry mojido and some other drink. All of them turned out the way we like. One of the drink wasn't sweet enough and the bartender had no problem to bring more syrup. Thrum up to the service and drink. Food, ok, there are decent. The Korean BBQ taco was good! So does the braided chicken. The Buger we had taste like Big Mac + burgertory! But I mean it in a good way! Worth to try!  The decor there is very interesting, cozy, homie and old fashioned. There are some seats that has a fire place in the middle. Looks cool when they turned it on when it got to later of the night but I didn't see anybody was sitting there. So I am not sure if it would be too much heat. But it is definitely a cool center decor!   On our way out, I noticed people were lining up waiting to be seated. So either go early like we did or call upfront to make a reservation.  Overall, it was a good experience. I think we would go back.",

    "text": "After hearing good things about Carmellas, I made reservations for the Saturday following Valentine's day 4-6 weeks in advance. I received a call a week before the scheduled reservation asking if a high top was alright for our reservation. Having not been to the restaurant before and having no problem with a high top, I said no without hesitation. When we arrived to the restaurant for our reservation, we were seated at a high top, however what the phone call failed to mention was that the high top would be in the extremely crowded bar area next to the constantly opening door during freezing winter temperatures. It was also next to a guy who was so drunk he was screaming songs from Beauty and the Beast at the top of his lungs and should not have continued to be served, but he was. We ordered a peach old fashioned and a cherry old fashioned, both were full of canned juice syrup and extremely viscous. For $10, i can get a better drink most places in Pittsburgh. Our food arrived and my husband ordered a bison burger and fries. It came with 3 fries, literally, for $16. I ordered steak and frites. For my meal, the quantity was not the problem. However, the entire meal was cold and soggy, including the steak. Not what I would expect for $26. The waiter was totally inattentive. For a $75 meal I would expect a higher level of dining experience. We will not be back and would urge others to do the same. But hey, at least they won that soup award.",

Service is efficient and friendly, and they have a wonderful drink selection--Carmella's is a place I suggest when I know my group includes beer, wine and liquor drinkers. Their wine by the glass is always good because they keep it on draft (I think). My favorite is the Hahn GSM blend (try it--you won't be disappointed!). The reason Carmella's doesn't get five stars is because the food is inconsistent. I have had some items I love and others that are downright awful and have even had a mixed experience ordering the same item (bison burger) on two different visits with it being great one day and meh the next time I ordered it. The bar area is fairly spacious, but tends to get crowded. They have a small patio out front to sit on during nice weather, but it's small, so don't count on getting to sit outside. The dining room is pretty big, but some of the tables are cramped and uncomfortable, while others make for a super cozy dining experience.   TL;DR: 5 stars for drinks/ambiance/service, 3 stars for food.",

    "text": "The atmosphere and drink options are great. I think their food menu could use some work though. We went there for dinner and they seem to have several great options but they're kind of limited in normal/boring options. I know that sounds weird but it would be nice to have a regular burger option in case you are feeling a little less adventurous that day instead of bison burgers, scallops, etc... those things are sometimes great but sometimes a person in the group just wants something normal. Again, I totally get how weird that sounds.  We also went for brunch later in the weekend with out of town guests and again, they just try too hard to be fancy. I got the Carmella's breakfast which is basically a giant breakfast with almost anything you would want. Some of those items include bacon which is over-peppered and home fry type things smothered in cheese. Bacon and home fries are already really good without trying to overdo them by smothering them in seasoning or cheese. Also, why does this meal need waffles AND toast? Most people only need one bread item for breakfast and this is overdoing it. The waffles were fine though as were the eggs. I didn't eat the sausage because I don't think anyone needs to eat sausage and bacon for breakfast and I didn't eat the huge piece of melon because I hate honeydew as do most people. If you want to serve fruit, maybe serve something a lot of people like like berries, watermelon, etc. I hate when restaurants serve honeydew/cantaloupe. I really feel like they only serve it because it's super cheap. Anyway, those are my thoughts. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great.",

Unfortunately, caught up in the St. Patty's Day festivities, they weren't offering their normal menu, only a specialty one for the day. Food was hit or miss; specialty omelet needed more basil and more mozz... the ends of the omelet had no filing at all, just dry egg :-/ But homefries were really yummy and beau said his duck tacos were some of the best he's had. Beau's sister's baked eggs were not her favorite. It was eggs [over]baked in a skillet of tomato sauce.... but she said the flavor was good.  Anyway, their heart was in the right place - we all loved the service, environment, and drinks. I'd definitely come back to chill and sip drinks at the bar and try something off their regular menu.",

Just a bit disappointed that when we came in there was only one other person at the bar and I asked the bartender what good infusions did they have and what was good.

We came for a Saturday brunch (served till 3) I had the bison burger special which was flavorful and presented beautifully on a slate. My partner had the shrimp po boy which was delicious although different than any we've ever had since it was blackened and not with the traditional mayo sauce. Beer selection was excellent - at least 20 taps of great craft beer (I had a free will coffee oatmeal).  The place is very well appointed with careful attention to every detail.  The cloth napkins are large and tied with a burlap tie. Cooper top tables in the bar are beautiful and the bar area has a great selection of scotch, whiskey and bourbons.  Will definitely be back again to try dinner.",

They offered to cook me a striped seabass atop a hot rock on my table, and I was a little overwhelmed.  The second time I went for dinner I had the most delicious pork chop I've had the pleasure of tasting. This was in February for a special Valentine's Day prixe-fixe menu.  The third time was recently, for brunch, and this is the visit that knocked my socks off and prompted me to start Yelping from the mountaintops (or mount). I had a sausage gravy and biscuits dish with a side of bacon. Simple, yet oh so very delicious. My husband had scallops Benedict and was equally impressed. Their dishes had so much flavor and were just so savory. Perfect brunching! The best part? The coffee. French press, two cups, so smooth.  Oh, Carmella's, you can cook me brunch anytime you want!",

The portions are not huge at this price point but they are enough to leave full and the quality of the food more than makes up for it.   The atmosphere was described by Munch as a \"pre-prohibition hunting lodge\". I cannot confirm whether or not that is True (I'm not 90 years old.) However, it does have a homey lodge feel and everything has a nice classic feel.   Excellent draft list and very good classic cocktails.",

My husband had the old fashioned and I tried the strawberry- jalapeno margarita. I've never had a margarita with these two flavors infused and it was unique and good. I liked that it wasn't necessary spicy but you could taste fresh jalapeno that added a nice burst of flavor without over powering the strawberry. You just have to try it! We started with the trout dip which was a first for us. The trout dip wasn't spectacular in my opinion but was good. For our entrees, my husband had the porter house veal and I had the herb crusted duck. All I can say is that our entrees were amazing. I'm still craving my meal. The veal was like cutting into butter and melted in your mouth. The herb crusted duck was seasoned perfectly and the cauliflower mash was a perfect blend. Savory and flavorful could ultimately describe our overall meal experience at Carmella's.",

I had already considered Carmella's based on previous reviews, and when I looked in from the sidewalk it seemed to have exactly what I was looking for. When I first walked in a gentleman whom I thought was leaving was holding the door for me, but it turns out he was instead a really friendly greeter--great first impression! I sat at the bar, which was fairly crowded, but the service was good with friendly staff. Had the hangar steak and couple of pints and enjoyed it all so much that I asked to meet Carmella to thank her for a great experience. I travel all over the world and when I'm in Pittsburgh this will now be one of my \"go to\" places. Enjoy!",

How I just stumbled upon this gem now is beyond me, but I will right this wrong and return soon and likely frequently.  My friend and I were walking along East Carson killing time before we went to dinner and by chance popped into Carmella's.  We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a very friendly and extremely knowledgeable bartender who schooled my friend on the various fruit infused vodkas and different options for cocktails.  I just went straight to the WINE ON TAP!  This, my friends, is no box of wine, but free flowing crisp fresh wine from a tap.  And, bonus, it was happy hour so it was 25% off.  Due to our prearranged dinner plans elsewhere we only ordered an appetizer - the fried deviled eggs.  The serving was two eggs, each sliced, allowing us each our own egg.  I enjoyed it but would have liked a little more of the sauce that was on the plate.  It was served on two cute little antique plates that you'd be most familiar from your Grandma's set of dishes.    The atmosphere here is great.  The bartender described the owner's style as \"American Picker\" and that was dead on.  Everywhere you look you'll find a cute little accent and treasure on the wall or perched on a shelf.    The dinner menu isn't very big but I have no doubt each dish is prepared wonderfully.  I can't wait to come back and stay longer.",

The birthday girl wanted to go some place different for brunch and boy, did we go someplace different. The decor is, how do I even put it, weird as heck? Or not what I expected. Carmella's owners described it as, \"They both felt that the Southside was ready for a more upscale ambiance that would attract and support a more mature audience. With a lodge-like feel due to the wooden beamed cathedral ceiling, an open fireplace, taxidermy, and stained glass windows that adorn the dining room. Our guests feel as though they are tucked away in a warm and cozy ski lodge in the heart of Southside.\" I do not know if they really hit that nail on the head but it was interesting to say the least. And the food was good, so really that is all that matters.   I got the Crab Cake Benedict. I thought it was really good. I could have done with a little less of the remoulade sauce, but I was super surprised at the size of the crab cake. The flavor of the dish was good. I would have also liked to have the bacon in a few slices and not chopped up. I think that the poached egg was also done very well, it was impressive. I cannot poach an egg so when I find a place that does it well, I am impressed.   We also opted for dessert since it was a celebration. We got the last apple berry dumpling. It was fantastic. It came with a scoop of ice cream on the side. Dove right into that one! Yum!!  I will say that it was not what I expected but the food was good and I could be persuaded to go back again. This time, I will be expecting the decor and not surprised by it.",

    "text": "I have a gift.  A special talent.  If I love a dish, the restaurant immediately takes it off the menu.  If you want to get rid of a dish, just make it delicious and serve it to me.        In all seriousness though, Carmella's is a old favorite that has just not been living up...hence a prior five star review down to three.   It's been a slow decline, but the last several visits weren't up to snuff at all...and that has made things I previously overlooked (ahem...I'm talking about you, uncomfortable bar stools) more obvious and more annoying.  I've also noted a gradual decline in the value too.  What used to be a half off happy hour is now 25% off small plates.  That's fine - I am willing to pay for quality, but I want to get it consistently and I just haven't been.   Here are a couple examples of some other recent visits.  About a month ago, I showed up looking for my beloved tuna poke.  It's bright and fresh and light and sometimes just the dinner I need.  The roe is a nice addition and makes it superior to other poke options around town.  I got a glass of wine and settled in to order, only to be told that the July 4 special menu was in effect.  No poke on that menu.  Nevermind that it wasn't actually the 4th.  The bartender basically acted like I was lucky they bothered to open at all on the day before a holiday, and then served me some mac and cheese (sans the bacon I'd asked for) on a plastic plate.  Ok fine.  Whatever.   I'll give you the holiday excuse.     Tonight's visit was dubbed \"we don't have that\".  FIVE times in the course of one dinner, I had to hear \"we don't have that\".   Two different kinds of liquor, usually in stock, were not available.  Merlot?   Not by the glass and not a bottle less than $50 either.  The bruschetta I so loved...replaced by an inferior burrata.  Tuna Poke (arguably the best small plate in the house)...sorry, not tonight.  And PS, don't come back for it, because they're taking it off menu altogether.   Dessert...again, a chosen option was not an option.   The menu is currently a big tease.  Overall, the food was good, though $18 got one of us two small scallops and some undercooked risotto.   The real problem was that no one really got what they wanted, because they didn't have it.     Rest In Peace, tuna poke.  I will miss you.",

    "text": "One of the funniest experiences I've had in South Side was when I came here on a Tuesday at 10pm and the maitre d' asked if we had a reservation when the restaurant was completely empty! It definitely added to the quiet charm of Carmella's, which I ended up enjoying.  The drinks here are well-executed (although they are by no means cheap). The food is modern-American with a twist. Instead of typical burger made with ground beef, you can expect bison and elk instead. French fries are actually giant potato logs, confit in duck fat. The only negative thing I can say about the food is that it is a bit on the salty side.   Still, for the creativity and surprising experience, I would recommend checking out Carmella's.",

    "text": "We walked in on a rainy Friday night around 7:30PM and were seated immediately.  I really enjoyed the vibe of Carmella's; lighting was a little too dim maybe, but overall it felt genuine and pretty intimate.  It felt like a great use of space.  We sat in the back restaurant section, but we were given the option of sitting in the bar as well.  I wasn't sure if this was an Italian themed restaurant or a lodge so I guess that was a tad bit confusing.  I ordered the hanger steak with yucca fries and I thought it was good - the price was definitely affordable for the taste, I appreciate that as I find some restaurants in Pittsburgh overprice steak simply because it's steak.  The waitresses were friendly and helping at each other's tables.  I wasn't in love with this place, maybe because for the theme the menu felt incredibly limited; however, the service is definitely why I'm giving this place a good rating.  I'd come back to hang out in the bar because I liked the vibe, but not so sure about the food.",

The drinks are also delicious.  I tried a moscow mule since that is what they are known for - not my thing to begin with but it was still refreshing.  They have an expansive whiskey selection and you can become a \"member,\" so to speak, and they will keep track of the ones you have tried.  They also make a mean manhattan and old fashion.

There was a pair of pirate tickets up for grabs and the bartender asked literally everybody at the bar except for me.

We started with Austin Mules at the bar while we waited for our table (the restaurant was reserved for a rehearsal dinner). These were the best tasting mules! The bartender told us they use fresh lime juice and it really made all the difference. We were sat shortly after the large party cleared out and ordered our appetizers, the Devilsh Eggs and the Crab Avocado Dip. The apps came quickly especially considering the entire restaurant sat at the same time. Both appetizers were excellent! I ordered the Duck Confit Tacos and he ordered the Smoked Pork Chop with Risotto. The tacos were just divine and I wished I could savor the flavor forever. My fiance's pork chop was perfectly cooked and the risotto was delicious. For dessert we had the chocolate-filled churros with bananas and bread pudding ice cream and ate every last bite. The staff was all very friendly and the owner, Carmella, was incredibly attentive, stopping by our table several times to make sure our experience was going well. I mean this when I say, from start to finish, this was the best meal I HAVE EVER HAD!! If we didn't already have dinner plans I would've been happy eating at Carmella's every night of my trip. If you're in Pittsburgh visiting or live there, this is a must. I cannot wait to go back.",

Looking for somewhere to sneak into today without father's day reservations...we were lucky to get in - they were busy!  Clearly, she has a nice following, which comes from serving consistently awesome food.  The drink menu is impressive.  The bloody mary was seriously one of the best I've ever had.  She told me she has been working on her recipe for a while - and you can taste the love that goes into it.  The liquor menu is extensive.  The food....very impressive.  It's be a while since I've been blown away by a great food experience.  I'm sure who is running the kitchen....but cheers to you, you are doing it RIGHT.  We had the bison burger and the spicy chicken sandwich today...with the awesome crispy potato wedges, super crispy fried in duck fat.   The food served at the tables around me, had my mouth watering....specials today were Lobster Mac & Cheese, NY Strip and Veal OssoBucco.  Breakfast looked fantastic. Breakfast sandwiches, Eggs, Omelets and a crazy impressive Chicken/Blueberry Waffle.   I can't remember the last time I had such a hard time deciding what to order because I wanted to try so many things.  We will be back - and I will bring friends.  It's a great place, clearly run by great people.  We love small business owners....and this owner is knee deep in her business.  We see you Carmella - NICE JOB!",

Can't speak to the cocktails this time around, but I have had the Banana Old Fashioned previously, and it was tasty enough for someone who doesn't really like the taste of whiskey. For brunch, I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict. It was tasty, but I think it could have been enhanced by serving the English muffin on the side, rather than underneath. It was quite soggy, and didn't really add much to the dish. You're already getting some bready-ness from the crab cake. Ultimately, the service and food were very good, but I think the prices were just a little steep for what we received.",

    "text": "We met up with one of our Yelp friend's for Brunch here on an early Sunday afternoon around 1pm.  I made reservations ahead of time just in case.  I never like parking in the South Side but that's why we like to come here on Sunday because it's usually easy to get street parking.  Not his Sunday.  There was some kind of bike race going on and Carson Street was blocked.  A couple bridges were shut down too.  It really caused us to get here later than we wanted and not in the best mood but we made it and we are so glad that we came here.       You walk in and it's a long sort of rectangle type of restaurant.  The bar was to the left and on the right side there were tables along the wall that were all reserved.  We had a reservation so we just sat down at a reserved table.  There was table seating at the back of the restaurant that would be good if you brought kids here or wanted a quieter atmosphere but we didn't go back there.       When we sat down a waitress came up to greet us and gave us menus.  My wife ordered an Irish coffee and I just got some water.  Carrie's coffee was a French press coffee.  So they gave her the liquor in a cup at first but she had to wait a few minutes for the French press coffee to brew while on the table.  It was really cool!  It's a strong coffee (more for the caffeine) but she liked it!  I was really hungry so I decided against having a drink but their beer on tap looked good.       I liked their brunch menu a lot. I was going back and forth on a few different things but I finally decided on the Carmella's Breakfast.  It had everything that I wanted on there and I was so hungry.  Carrie ordered their Crab Cake Benedict.         The food came out at a reasonable time and it was really good.  Carrie liked her Crab cake Benedict a lot.  It looked really tasty.  There was nothing great about my brunch but it was still very good.  It comes with your plain old breakfast items but that is what I wanted.  The eggs were good.  The Belgian waffle with their sausage was delicious.  The only thing disappointing was the fresh fruit that came with it.  I seriously only got 4 small blackberries for my fresh fruit.  It was more of a garnish.  Anyways it was a filling meal and I was happy.  I would like to try their other brunch items on a return visit one day.       Other than Carson Street being shut down the atmosphere was great for Sunday Brunch.  It looks like a cool place to have dinner and drinks watching a sporting event too.  If you're looking for a good brunch stop you will not be disappointing in trying Carmella's brunch on a Sunday afternoon!",

My wife ordered a Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, which she initially enjoyed until she got to the back half of the chicken patty. The back half was entirely raw. Not a little undercooked but truly raw.   We pointed this out to the waitress, who offered very little in the way of apology. She came back with the check, comped that one item, and offered another incredibly lukewarm apology. Food safety is no joke, and the restaurant and their staff should be admonished for treating it so cavalierly. We will not be back. Go at your own risk.",

Bonus, you could hear live acoustic music overflowing from the bar area (which wasn't too loud for good convo in the dining room). One of the owners stopped by our table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their restaurant. I can't recommend this place enough.",

The attention to detail in terms of the variety of placemats, interesting salt and pepper shakers on the ledge, and pictures on the walls was truly impressive.

The steak was perfectly cooked and the toppings were deliciously spicy. My husband had the croque madame. It was a large portion and he liked the sandwich and the bread, but found the bechamel sauce to be a little thick. In general, the table found that their dishes needed salt.

There was a little bit of a mix up regarding our reservation but they were able to straighten it out and accommodate us within 10 minutes of arrival.  We sat at the round communal table around the fire which was quite warm and cozy (them almost a little too warm after awhile there!) . I sampled a couple of cocktails which were both excellent, and had the mushroom soup with the fried skate and the lemon ricotta cheesecake.  Everything was fantastic, portions were generous, and the presentation was beautiful.  All items also came out pretty quickly and the server was attentive.  I also loved the cozy ambiance and it was nice that the busier bar area was separate dining room.   The only awkward part when I first arrived is that there was this random guy standing outside a few feet in front of the front door in a winter fur trapper hat who was trying to talk to me from like 10 feet away as I was waiting outside for my friend (saying things like \"hey there!\" and I thought he was a random guy trying to hit on me or something.  When I started to walk in the restaurant I tried to just walk past him thinking he was just hanging out there when he then asks for my ID.  But he did not seem very professional and did not wear any sort of uniform or name badge so I found this rather sketchy, especially given that this was only 7pm and this is a nicer restaurant, not like a late night bar or club scene, at least not at that hour.  But besides that everything was a great experience.",

The pork chop had many good reviews and this sounded good to me. Unfortunately, the Chef cremated the pork chop. It was so overdone, I really had a hard time eating it. The server immediately asked if I wanted something else, but I declined. I was hungry  and I didn't realize at the time just how dried out it really was. I also didn't realize that the chorizo hash was extremely salty and the cranberry bourbon glaze was sickly sweet. I would not ever order the pork chop again even if it were cooked perfectly.   So how could I possibly put 4 stars on this restaurant you might rightfully ask? First off, it was huge that my server asked how my dinner was at the perfect moment after I had time to try it, but not ages after it arrived. I definitely could have sent this back and probably received something else pretty quickly. Clearly a lot of other folks have enjoyed this pork chop. Secondly, I loved the atmosphere-the music-the friendliness of the bartender and other patrons. Lastly, my dinner was comped. I ordered the wrong thing (for me) on the wrong night. I will definitely be back. I fully anticipate a 5-star experience the next time.",

    "text": "Carmella's is extremely difficult to describe, being a study in contrasts or a jumble of mismatched concepts, depending on your point of view. Start with the name. If the restaurant has 'pints' in its name, Carmella, pure Italian, doesn't fit. It needs an Irish woman's name like Megan or Sinead.   Next, the decor is an uncomfortable blend of mounted antlered animal heads from a hunting lodge and 1950s photographs and knickknacks from an old Italian grandmother's kitchen. Pretty strange.   The menu is very limited with only a single burger, scallops, pasta, fish, chicken, and steak offering. We split a wedge salad and chose the chicken and pasta entrees. The food was pretty good, although the chicken was a little over cooked and my pasta portion, while just right for me, might be disappointingly small for many American diners. Prices were quite reasonable.   We had good Moscow mules and a bottle of Chardonnay. That brings me to the final mismatch, the wine. The wine list includes very few moderately priced items. There are many interesting, higher priced wines that would be more suitable for a more upscale restaurant. Furthermore, one of the reasons we came on a Monday was to take advantage of the half price wine promotion. However, it applies only to wines under $50, which are almost nonexistent. With the assistance of our excellent server we found a way to participate.   Service was outstanding even though there was a single server who had to cover the mostly empty restaurant and the outside tables.  Overall it was a pretty good experience and so I rounded up to 4*. The bar was large and attractive. Looks like a good place for a drink.",

Fortunately (you'll find out why it was fortunate soon) Piper's was packed and had a wait too long for us to be able to make the movie. So, we pulled up No Wait, and decided to hit up Carmella's. There was no wait, ha, and we had recently read an excellent review and had planned on trying this place soon anyway. We walked the half block to Carmella's and were seated immediately in the small but lovely dining area.   It has a rustic feel, with exposed wooden beams, picnic-style wooden tables, and deer heads on the walls. There are what looks to be old family photographs and paintings on the wallpapered walls. Though warm in ambiance, I was a little cold the entire dinner due to sitting directly beneath a vent, but it was a small inconvenience quickly  forgotten  once we began eating.   The food was amazing. As always, I notified the waitress of my numerous food allergies, and after conferring with the chef she gave me suggestions and alternatives for my dinner (another wonderful experience with a Pittsburgh chef being willing to work with my restraints). I ended up with the smoked pork chop with braised kale and dirty rice. The pork chop was perfectly cooked, and the sauce on top complimented the meat wonderfully. The fatty portions of the pork simply melted in your mouth. The kale came out a bit cold, but it is hard to keep that vegetable warm. The rice was tasty, and made in what I believe was pork fat. My boyfriend started off with the venison kielbasa and kale soup. He enjoyed it, but liked his duck confit tacos much better. The Korean BBQ sauce was spicy and the duck tender. He did note that they were a bit hard to eat on the slate on which they were served, though he did appreciate the careful presentation of the food. We shared an order of the duck fat fries, which were thick and crispy potato wedges (they reminded me of KFC potato wedges somewhat, if KFC cooked in duck fat and didn't let the wedges get soggy).   For beverages, we each tried one of the classic cocktails listed on their drink menu. While good, they were no where near as unique and complex as those at Bar Marco, Butcher and the Rye, or Tender. But, the clientele in the bar area did not seem like the type to seek out a craft cocktail.  They do have a nice list of wines, available in carafes or by the bottle. The list also includes some PA wines, which is (sadly) not something often seen in local Pittsburgh restaurants.   Overall, we enjoyed our experience here and look forward to returning soon, hopefully with friends!",

    "text": "I went here for the first time ever. The Decour and ambience is absolutely amazing. What a transformation it is from the previous dive bar.  It is definitely a casual atmosphere and no need to get dressed up. I went here with two other guys and our wives and we went for more of a family-style meal. We just wanted to try out as many dishes as possible as they looks so good  The guy started out with different varieties of liquor all based on recommendations of the bartender and we're certainly not disappointed.  We started off with the shrimp ceviche appetizer, meat and cheese platter, baked clams and macaroni and cheese with bacon bits. All of them were awesome.  We all shared the pork chop, crabcakes, a burger, and the duck tacos. The Porkchop was the star of the night followed by the bison burger.  I can't wait to come back here again for some drinks. This is definitely one of the places to add to the top hipsters list of places to hang out in Pittsburgh",

We were the only ones here and service was both slow and a bit confusing. It was difficult for my friend with a food allergy to order as they weren't very flexible with substitutions, but didn't make that clear when she was ordering. The food was pretty good, but pretty much every egg that was served was over cooked. Granted this is only their second week serving brunch, so I'm sure they are going to improve and are just working out some of the glitches.",

    "text": "Wow, I love this place!  I finally made it for brunch because I kept hearing wonderful things about this place.  Well I was not disappointed!  I got the breakfast sandwich and my companion got the Croque Madamme.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our selections.  His came with  a side of pomme frites and mine came with amazing potatoes, in a fantastic sauce, more of like a Lyonaise potato.  The only thing I didn't eat was the top of the muffin of the sandwich.  It was honestly just much better as an open face sandwich.  I also had a mimosa and it was served with Prosecco and poured and priced just right at $6!  It was more Prosecco and less OJ-just how I like it!  The decor is great in this place now that it has changed ownership and vibes.  I felt as if I was in an old late 1800's/early 1900's saloon in San Francisco during the Gold Rush!  Great fuzzy wallpaper in the back and a great fire place (faux) in the middle of the back space with chairs surrounding it circularly.  Our waitress Dawn was fantastic as well.  Very friendly and knowledgeable about the spot.  I asked her if it was under new ownership and I was happy to hear that Mike from Jekyl and Hyde is the owner, and he named it after one of his long time and dear bartender's Carmella.  I was so happy to hear this because Jekyl was a regular spot for me when I lived in the South Side about 5 years ago.  SInce they used to have live music at Jekyl.  I asked if they had live music here.  Dawn informed me that on Sunday they do have live music and it is often one of Pittsburgh's best musicians (Clinton Clegg of the Commonheart).  This means that Mike is loyal to his talent because Jekyl was the first place I met Clinton and kept coming back on Sunday's for open mic night to hear him.  You guys did a wonderful job with the space and food and I will definitely be back again, and many more times to come!   Bravo!",

    "text": "This was my second time at Carmella's and each time I expect it to be more better than it is.  The first time I went, the crab and avocado dip had so much mayo that any other flavor was masked by it.             This time around, I had the burrata app which was basically pesto and cheese on toast.  The other item I had was the mushroom ravioli under the Shared Plates menu.  When I ordered this, I asked the waiter how much came with the plate and he said \"enough for one person as a dinner, or for two people to share\".  What came was one(!) ravioli on a plate.  How is this enough for one person as a dinner or two to share?  I would love to know.  The waiter proceeded to ask the kitchen about the plate, and they stated that \"they used to include two small raviolis but that the one bigger one looked better for presentation.\"  I could care less about presentation and more getting enough food to feel full- and the kicker is that the ONE ravioli cost $13!!!  One ravioli for $13?!  I thought they would at least compensate by removing it from the check or bringing out another ravioli, neither of which happened.    I will definitely not be going back.  This place has been very disappointing.",

    "text": "I had no idea that this place even existed.  I am normally very anti-South Side because I do not like the feel of the normal South Side place.  This place does not have the South Side feel at all.  My sister and brother-in-law found this on a Friday night because they were looking to avoid the crowded college feel and they loved it.  We went back for Saturday Brunch.  We were not disappointed.  We got a carafe of Bloody Marys and were very impressed.  They do a black pepper and garlic infused vodka which worked very well.  You also get a mini appetizer (shrimp, olive, pickle and cheese) as the garnish.  The carafe produces 4 Bloody Marys and is a great deal.  The menu is small, but there is something for everyone.  We had one Vegan in the group and they made her a delicious Vegan plate (not on the menu.)  We all shared most of the food and we had: the bison burger, the omelet of the day, sausage biscuits and gravy the pork hash and the breakfast/brunch board.  Everyone loved their food.  The bison burger had great flavor and was very juicy.  The omelet was cooked perfectly and you could just tell that the eggs were very fresh.  The sausage biscuits were very light; not the heavy gravy that you get at a lot of places.  You could also really taste the sage.  The hash was flavorful and the sunny side eggs were cooked perfectly.  The breakfast/brunch board had a great variety.  We were impressed with the sausages and the waffles.  We sat in the back for brunch.  The decor is very unique and there is a lot to see.  The re-use their liquor bottles as vases and candle holders.  We then moved to the bar after brunch for cocktails.  The bar is very unique,  They use 1/2 barrels as the backs to the tap system.  They have a very diverse collection of tequila, bourbon, scotch and whisk(e)y.  My husband has the Moscow Mule and he said it was great.  I also had their Old Fashion and it was perfect.  This is defiantly a place that we will be back  to and will recommend.  There were six of us and no one had a bad time or was unhappy with anything.  There is a parking lot right next door as well.",

You completely forget that you're on Carson St.   They really pride themselves on being more locally sourced and you can taste the difference. The meat is so fresh and flavorful that I start getting sad when I'm on my last few bites. The drinks are really fun too! They have a bunch of cocktails and fruit infused liquors that make every visit different.   Strong recommendation is to get a dessert. All of the desserts are great but their cinnamon roll is to-die-for. Another recommendation is to go with a group and make sure everyone gets something different. It's on the pricier side so this why you can all try a little bit of what they have to offer.   They also participate in restaurant week so check them out then!",

I did the latter a couple months ago before a show at The Rex Theater.   I arrived a few minutes before my friend and was being indecisive about my drink selection. I felt that the bartenders were a bit aloof, more interested in personal conversation with each other than making sure that the customers were all content. They weren't rude, but I thought service left something to be desired.  I had a tasty Moscow Mule and enjoyed drinking it from a beautiful copper mug. My friend and I then split the Duck Fat Fries, Crispy Brussels, and Mac and Cheese. The Crispy Brussels were the clear winner of the bunch with the Mac and Cheese coming in a close second.  I struggled with how to rate Carmella's. In some ways, I wanted to give it 3 stars for its somewhat stodgy, dated decor, mediocre service, and my lack of excitement to return in the future. But then, I also considered giving the restaurant 5 stars for the quality of beverage and food that I consumed. For that reason, I felt that 4 stars really reflects my full range of emotions regarding this restaurant, but make sure to try a number of menu items while here to enjoy the full experience.",

I just loved the decor - we sat in the bar but the back room look welcome and cozy with a fire place!!  We had a few rounds of wine and split a chopped salad and a cheese board! Will definitely come back here to try more of the delicious looking menu items. The service was fantastic too! Our drinks never went empty, and we didn't feel rushed at all!",

There really is no other bar/restaurant in Pittsburgh with this kind of vibe.

Fear not, Sunday diners, as they have a really nice dining room in the back far from the din of the bar area.  Their menu is super interesting and inventive and the decor of the dining area is sort of lux hunting lodge?  There are huge animals mounted on the walls and a really cool fire pit in the middle of the room.  It's sort of rustic and nicely done.  The food was really good and the service was very friendly and attentive.  We tried the Devilish Eggs, the Beet Salad, and the Wild Boar Bolognese.  My favorite was the beet salad.  The eggs were pretty good too although sort of a strange texture thing going on.  Loved the Bolognese noodles and how fresh the sauce tasted.    This place is really run well and fun to visit.  I love the small plate/sharing concept and lingering over some of their drink options.  We will be back to try out their Sat/Sun Brunch from 11-3.",

We ended up going for my dads birthday and I was pleasantly surprised with the meal. We got three apps to share and I enjoyed 2/3. Brussel sprouts and cauliflower were both delicious and the trout spread was not my favorite. All three were very small portions and each one would serve about three people.   For dinner I got the short rib and it was delicious. The meat was so tender and the flavor was great. I also loved whipped potatoes- but who doesn't like those?!  Our server was great and efficient. As soon as I was running low on water she was right there to fill it up. Also a nice touch was that the chef came out twice to check in on us and see how everything was tasting or to see if we needed anything. Not only did he prepare us an awesome meal but he also had a cool personality.   4/5 because the portions were a little small for the price.",

Not counting all the drinks they do.   But their food, oh my God. Chef Carl Pierre Louis, is fantastic. The art he does with the food is out of this World. I am kinda a regular at this place already, but today I had the Elk burger with pork belly, I am not kidding now, it was by far the best burger I ever had in my life and let's say I've had a few burgers in my life! Their lemon gnocchi is outstanding as well. However, the most impressive thing I ever had here is the S'mores Cannolli: I don't have words to describe it, the perfect quantity of chocolate, marshmallow, ice cream and the Cannolli.  Congratulations  chef. You are the best!",

Carmella's has a bar and a couple small tables near the entrance, and a dining area/room in the back with a bunch of tables. They stop serving food at some point in the evening (I forgot what time), but keep serving drinks at the bar.   Late night drinks: I had their Whiskey Sour and the Paloma. Both were good, but not life-changing. I liked the Whiskey Sour more. I think the main problem for me was that there were some people being rambunctious next to us, and there was really only bar seating which I'm not extremely comfortable with. The bartender was very nice though!  Brunch: I ordered the Scallops Benedict. Highly recommend!! The scallops were cooked perfectly and were a decent size. They were well seasoned and tasted delicious. If you like scallops, you should definitely try it out! The potatoes that came on the side were also delicious. For my drink I had the Mimosa, which was pretty average. Would pass on a drink for my next visit.",

We weren't left wandering around when we got there, looking very clueless. We were greeted and sat. Our server was on point beginning to end. For starters, we had the burratta, and crab a avocado dip, both VERY good, especially the dip. A dozen oysters, I usually don't like minuet and was almost disappointed that the minuet was served already on the oysters, turns out I just like THEIR minuet. The soup of the day was their award winning mushroom soup, delicious. Then for entrees we had the bison burger, one of the best burgers I've ever had, and the lamb. The lamb could've been a little more tender and moist, but was still a great dish! I can't wait to get some friends to try it out! If you go, get a spicy mango mule!",

It truly should be closer to the Cultural District downtown because I would come here before every show, and for every business meeting. The attention to detail is unparalleled.",

A traditional/cozy type atmosphere with a wide variety of drinks on the menu. Restaurant menu was different, and a little pricey. The average entree is about $20, but I must say I really enjoyed it. I just didn't expect the price given the location in the middle of Southside. I ordered the seasonal specialty of crab cakes - it was a Friday during lent- and they were fantastic, although I did not care for the garnish that accompanied it. Our table shared some appetizers- Mac n cheese, the cheese board, and the crab and avocado dip- they were all fantastic. I would highly recommend and likely see myself returning!",

Burger was really tasty, but I have no idea why you would not at least offer lettuce and tomato.  It needed some cool crunch to cut through the rich meat and savory cheese.  Would have made this burger so much better.  Burger was served with exactly three duck fat fried potato wedges.  These were rich enough that I didn't really need more, but it seemed skimpy for a $14 entree.  Rustic bread with pesto and goat cheese appetizer was obviously so stale that even baking it couldn't save it from crumbling.  That was a real fail.  Ok in a pinch, but probably wouldn't go back for the food.  Beer, yes.",

    "text": "Carmella's deserves a 5 star in every category: Food, Drinks, Ambience & Service! I went to dinner there last night with 5 friends. We each ordered a different drink, appetizer and meal. Not a single complaint!   Here are the deets:  Drinks: Carmella's offers liquor infusions!! They change every few months, depending on what Carm & her staff invent. Last night, we tried the pineapple vodka and cherry vodka. Both over ice and very flavorful. We also ordered the Moscow mule and an Old Fashioned. The Moscow mule was delicious, components were well balanced and appropriately served in a copper mug. The Old Fashioned had a solid kick but strong orange pull that gave it a nice finish. We also ordered a bottle of their Terredora Dipaolo Anglinico 2012 red wine. Bold vanilla and cherry flavors. It pairs well with any and all meat dishes.  Food: Appetizers- Steak Tar Tar, Hummus, Duck confit tacos Entrees- Gnocchi, Arugula & Beet salad, Pork Chop with Grits, Shrimp Linguine, NY Strip with flavor fries (large cut wedges) The portion sizes were generous for all the dishes.  Steak Tar Tar- excellent taste and presentation! served with fries which was a nice change Hummus served with carrots and celery by request. Heavy paprika but delicious!  Duck confit tacos- fantastic! Add the lime juice! All together, the lime and kimchi created a unique flavor.  The Gnocchi with meat sauce was non standard in presentation however, it remained True to the traditional dish and the beef flavor held very well in the sauce.  Arugula Salad with Beets was crisp and fresh, I couldn't ask for anything more.  Pork Chop portion was large and grits had a strong butter cream base. Great pair! NY Strip- also great portion size and prepared well. Simple presentation with the flavor fries. Shrimp linguine- I'm always a fan when shrimp dishes include ample amounts of large shrimp and this dish did not disappoint!   Dessert- we opted for chocolate stout and coffee with Baileys and Jameson!  Ambience- stained glass windows, antique pieces throughout the restaurant and a fireplace with seating for 8 in the middle of the room. Dark lighting & high ceilings with exposed brick.   Service: Waitress was knowledgable & attentive. Made great suggestions and helped our guests with food allergies order the right dishes.   Make reservations for a Saturday night and go often! SS was in desperate need of a place like this!!",

    "text": "Carmella's a newcomer on Carson Street, replacing the trusty and rusty dive bar Intermission.    Like several other new places in Pittsburgh, Carmella's is trying to capitalize on the current popularity of prohibition-type cocktail bars. As a bar, it succeeds. As a restaurant, not so much... yet.   Decor:  Picture yourself inside an old hunting lodge, only cleaner. No. Picture an Abercrombie and Fitch without the smell of Fierce cologne choking you. Moose heads on the walls, cozy fires, men and women sharply dressed in vests and plaid. But instead of selling you $60 sweaters, these fine folks are selling you handcrafted cocktails, beer, and whiskey. The latter, in my opinion, is a much better way of spending your money.   Service: The servers and bartenders are incredibly friendly and attentive, which is great! I know this sounds odd, but Carmella's is the only place I've ever been to that overdoes the service. This is not first class seating on an overseas flight to Dubai. I don't need a hot towel before I start tucking into my appetizer. Notwithstanding, servers are well versed regarding both drinks (they can tailor drinks according to your taste) and food.  Speaking of the food...  \"Plates\":  Let me say that all of the dishes I have had at Carmella's are as delicious as they are innovative.  The head chef and Cutthroat Kitchen winner - True story - creates amazing food. We were given tiny tasters of watermelon and lime with cilantro as a palate cleanser. The gnocchi is light and smothered in a decadent bolognese sauce with mascarpone cheese.  The lamb meatball is incredibly flavorful and will leave you wanting more. The charcuterie appetizer (pricey at 20+) is an intuitive pairing of meats and cheeses. So what's the problem? The plates are so small they couldn't satisfy a mouse's hunger. There were barely four or five gnocchi and one singular medium meatball for my friend. If Carmella's wants to market themselves as a tapas or small plates restaurant, that is fine (hint: they should!). But that is concept is completely lost on the menu. Currently, the appetizers and entrees are separated by sections but are the same size - tiny. A table for two would need at least four or five items to satiate their appetites. Add a few drinks, you are looking at a large bill! All that is needed is a simple re-write of the menu and perhaps a slight increase in portion size. Hot small plates. Cold small plates. Desserts. Order a few and share! Problem solved.  Drinks: Extensive and decently priced whiskeys from the tried and True Jonny Walker to my lesser known favorites like Yamazaki and Angel's Envy. Handcrafted cocktails and and an incredible selection of affordable draft beers. I don't have to go on because this review is already rather verbose.   TLDR; Carmella's does the \"Pints\" part perfectly. The delicious \"Plates\" need a little more explanation and organization and I will happily give them five stars when that happens.",

My husband had the Carmella's breakfast which was perfectly displayed on a wooden plank everything you'd want for breakfast: scrambled eggs, waffle, thick smoked bacon and spicy sausage all fresh and high quality. Lovely and attentive service, excellent French press coffee and even served in pottery made nearby in Lawrenceville. Beautiful wooden bar, super clean. Will be back to try the many beers on tap!",

This one had kind of a log cabin feel with a bar when you first walk in. The greeter at the door was dressed the part with his fur hat and long coat. All the way in the back is a seated restaurant area. I would recommend either having reservations or putting your name on the wait list in advance. There was a fire pit in the middle of the room with a table around it. For appetizer I ordered a winter salad and it was a nice size and not too much dressing. It had a nice sweet flavor. I ordered the old fashioned drink. It was pretty strong but i liked it. Our waiter was good, we just told him to pick drinks for us because we couldn't decide. He did a good job because he just asked what flavors we liked and he delivered something we liked. I liked how this was a farm to table place. I got their special elk burger with blue cheese and sweet potato fries. I thought the burger was great and flavorful. The portions were a nice size and not overwhelming. I was eyeing the pumpkin seasonal dessert but I was full. I would come back again to try other things.",

G.   Oh where to begin.  When you first arrive the bar & staff are noticeably sharper than the average neighborhood bar. And it's easy to get cozy at the bar with friendly staff & amazing appetizers and bar food. But don't. Keep going. The restaurant area is absolutely too unique too miss. Get a table. Relax. Chat with your waitress. Order some appetizers & hand mixed drinks before going all out with selecting your meal. Our favorite- to each order a different item and switch and swap. Some items we love and order over & over again- and honestly- we've enjoyed everything so far-   Avocado & crab dip- I don't even like avocados ( no joke, Some would say that I passionately dislike them) yet this dip, - I would lick it off the dish if nobody was looking. Oh who am I kidding? I might someday it you were!!!   Hummus- oh. Yeah. Just enough of a zip of spice on the tongue to be perfect!  So delicious.   Green leafy healthy apps- fresh, crisp. So good.  Definitely make the decision to have one before your meal.  I am partial to the Winter Salad. The roasted beets are soooo good. I can't even explain just how delicious I want to put into words that it is. It just is beyond words delicious. Fantastic choice.   Mac N Cheese- I could start to drool just thinking about it. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. So good. Spicy w sharp white cheddar.   The Cauliflower- It doesn't sound like it is amazing. It is. Roasted. Pine nuts. Spiced perfectly. This isn't your momma' cauliflower. Or any other cauliflower you've ever had. This is cauliflower you will crave and be begging for more of. It's the only cauliflower I've ever had such passionate feelings towards.   Duck Lard- I never thought I'd have an opinion about duck fat. It turns out. I do. Thanks to Carmela's I feel passionate about wanting food that's been cooked in it. Read the menu. Look for the items that have been cooked in ducks fat. Order those items. Consume them. You will end your meal being pleasantly content with your life choices. French fries are heavily. French fries cooked in duck fat are like having angels hand feed you French fries while singing from the heavens.   Oh, Carmela's. The unassuming restaurant front on Carson Street hides the glorious experience provided inside. If you haven't had their delectable plates & pints, hurry to experience this darling establishment.  The only con, and some would consider it a strength, it's not a place to bring a small kid or baby. We take our Mr. Toddler our dining all over the place. He's been dining out since the day he went him from the hospital. He dines out almost everywhere with us. Except here. This isn't a place for little kiddo's. The space is too cozy.  Update---  2016 summer restaurant week  I love this place even more! It's time to open a second location as the secret it out about Carmella's awesomeness.",

Wood is everywhere and you kind of feel like you're in a camping lodge. It's really quite cozy.   The place was empty and I was alone and in a hurry so I sat at the bar, hoping to get the steak tartare I saw on their menu. It turned out to be brunch so I was a little bummed that I wasn't going to get the tartare but brunch on a Saturday is hard to come by so I was also excited. I ordered the baked eggs. It took some time for my order to come and I feared that the eggs were sitting. I was right. They were rock hard and the tomato sauce was pretty pretty generic. There was a little spinach and beet salad on the side that was a little bit on a saving grace but not enough. I usually don't sent things back and was pretty tight on time. However, I should have said something in this case. I ascribe my disappointing meal to a slow shift and a lazy waitress. That's not to say she was a bad waitress. I was once there and the slowest shifts are the hardest to care about good service sometimes. I didn't like the eggs but the salad gave me the confidence to say that I would give Carmella's another shot. Side note, the music sucked. It didn't go with the ambiance of the restaurant at all and should definitely be changed in my opinion.",

I was already dreading a meal with the kids in tow (especially when Fat Head's was our original destination) but this location was AMAZING and so kind to my children!   The decor is just really cool (I wish we were the table with the fire pit in the center!) - so it was cool on face value and gave my kids lots to look at and talk about (A+)  Then, the entire staff was just super friendly and knowledgeable. When my child asked the hostess about juice she was more than accommodating letting him know all the juices they had and continuing his never-ending conversation about food and gosh knows what else.  The beers were YUM and the food was the same. The prices were also not unreasonable which was refreshing. I had the Fall Salad, our entire table devoured 2 apps of pretzels, elk burgers, steak and macaroni cheese all around ... they were even so kind to make a grilled cheese for my four year old (which isn't on the menu).   It's a smaller place so I think it would be cool for dates because it's intimate and not too loud. If you're really into German culture, you'll like the plates and everything else too - they serve beers in the glasses they are meant to be served in and the plates are genuine (albeit fragile! And no - we didn't break anything)  This place was just a really cool find on Carson Street - and I didn't even know you couldn't smoke there but that would explain why I could breathe during my meal. A++ from this original NY-er where smoking was banned over a decade ago in restaurants.",

They have a variety of typical brunch drinks ranging $6-$10 and fresh pressed coffee, which was delicious. My friend got the scallops Benedict and I got the classic brunch plate vegetarian style. My plate was $15 and came with fluffy scrambled eggs, cheesey potato hash browns, toast with butter and jam, French toast (deep fried), and a sliced apple. If you get it with meat, for the same price, you also get sausage and bacon. It was a huge plate and delicious. The potatoes were to die for. I easily could have split my meal alone with 2-3 people. They have a nice atmosphere a little too dark for my personal preference and the front windows/wall all open up onto Carson street, which is nice on warm days.",

All were SO delicious. This is actually a 4.5 star rating because the food was so dang good and the atmosphere is antique-y and a tad rustic. Our server wasn't really on top of it tonight and we all could have used several water refills...plus he almost stabbed me with my fork when clearing a bunch of plates...but hey, I lived to tell the story. For dinner I had the spring vegetable curry and it was uh-mazing. The kimchi added a very nice flavor. Since I was with a birthday girl who knew the owner, we got a free charcuterie and cheese board. Very delicious! I also had the mint julep and it was spot on. I would be back here in a heartbeat.",

Everything is on point.  My most recent visit was for a friend's birthday and we sat at the tables across from the bar. They do have a dining room in the back. The hostess is located after the bar. This time I had the Seared Scallops and the fiance had the bison burger. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto they came on was delicious. My fiance loved his burger and it was cooked to a perfect medium.  They do infused vodkas and I highly suggest having a cocktail made with one. It's so good. If you're looking for more of a snack they have some tasty smalls plates. I love both their meat board and the cheese one.  The staff is always on top of everything and so friendly.  If you are looking for a great place to meet up with friends or a date night Carmella's is an amazing choice.",

The ambiance is very cozy but sophisticated and feels like a place you can have a nice conversation or enjoy a fun -- but not raucous -- time with a group of friends.  Definitely a very welcome departure from the usual Carson Street experience.  Their bar program is pretty awesome. They have a bunch of whiskeys and wines on tap, which is something I've so far seen mostly in bigger cities, and a very decent selection of craft beers as well. The cocktails are *excellent* - strong, balanced, not too sweet.  I enjoyed a tasty manhattan and boulevardier and would not hesitate to try any of their other cocktails on a future visit.  I was perhaps most excited for the new chef's food, having eaten and LOVED the food at Uchi in Austin.  We tried the deviled eggs, the lamb meatball, the sausage on a stick, and the deconstructed carrot cake.  All were tasty, but the deviled eggs and the sausage were absolutely stand-out dishes.  The sausage came on what looked like a real tree branch glazed so that it could support the food.  I probably could have done without the carrot cake, maybe the deconstruction was a little too much for my tastes.  We sat at the bar initially and the service was excellent there. When asked for recommendations, the bartender was very honest about which dishes were his favorite. Based on the broad sampling we ended up having, he was spot on. After our group grew and we moved to a table, the service became a little more erratic (though still totally pleasant -- just not super organized).  Overall, this is a fantastic place and I only wish it were in Lawrenceville so I could roll down Butler Street to get there!",

I can recommend the Tipperary. All in all a nice place to grab a bite and have a drink with friends.",

The decor and atmosphere is a huge improvement. The bathroom especially was a nice treat, just gorgeous.  My husband got a chilli mash that he very much enjoyed, while I got the BLT with vinegar fries. The bacon was a bit on the greasy side, but overall our food was just what we needed. I've only given Carmella's three stars for 2 reasons. 1. It's hard to judge a place before experiencing dinner service. In my mind the dinner experience can make or break an establishment. And 2. Even though I think the decor is a vast improvement, the mounted animal heads, the old-timey aprons worn by the waitsstaff, the toadstool of ketchup (see pic), all come off a bit try-hard.   But I will be back for dinner, definitely interested in trying this place out again and hopefully giving it more stars.",

I came last week after hearing they had a new chef, and the steak was tiny for $20-something, plus absolutely doused in salt. The cauliflower and quinoa is also a mess, just not tasty at all. My date got a bolognese that wasn't great either, though he thought it was ok.  Second of all, the bartender talked primarily to my date, and I found that to be pretty rude. I wear an engagement ring and I think it was pretty clear we were together -- why she found it necessary to ask him if he had been there before, if he liked the food, and if he needed more to drink but not me any of those questions is beyond me. It's like sales 101, no matter what you're dealing: talk to the woman or you're toast!   Third, it's loud and crowded on Fridays and Saturdays -- expensive enough for a date place but no ambiance for a date on those nights.  ***I downgraded this to one star from two stars after someone who I assume is affiliated in some way with the restaurant sent me a nasty Yelp message for my review that I just noticed.

The drinks are fantastic and worth every penny and the food is even better. I religiously get the southside and my boyfriend the penicillin drink and every small dish we have ate was phenomenal. Definitely worth it to check out.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I finally came to Carmella's after passing it many times. I think we were under the impression that it was a little on the pricey side...we were wrong.  We split the veal and burrata appetizer. Both were delicious! The pesto that comes with the burrata and the red sauce with the veal were very tasty. For our meals, I had the duck tacos and he had the steak. I really enjoyed the tacos. The korean style gave them a sweet taste, but not too sweet! You get 3 tacos- I was full with all the food! His steak had a nice spice rub with a kick to it!  I really enjoy the decor/cabin fever of Carmella's! The staff was very nice and gave great recommendations! Would recommend!",

    "text": "A friend and I went here for dinner tonight.    I really loved the atmosphere. Dark and cozy. I was not impressed with the menu however. It did not feature a large selection and the choices they did have were not anything \"normal\". Most dishes had something I did not like.....cumin, cilantro, hot peppers, roasted tomatoes walnuts.    I had the wild mushroom chicken, which was very good. It said it was served with asparagus....1 single asparagus!    The dish was scattered with some form of garnish ( a rough textured clover leaf). It was similar to bark mulch in texture.  My dining companion loved his pasta dish.  In my opinion the selection was small and the dishes were overpriced . I most likely won't be back.... Just my taste.",

    "text": "The bar is stunning, with big barrels brimming with taps, so many good things ready to be poured. I wouldn't ordinarily come to this area of town, but on a quiet Sunday late afternoon, it was the perfect place to be.  We were only to stay for one drink, but somehow we stayed for 2, and my sister bought a 6-pack of special brews for her friend to take home.  She was enjoying the various seasonal pumpkin brews and ciders, while my focus was on bourbon. Luckily the helpful, patient and kick-ass bartender Paige told me she makes a good old-fashioned, and boy, did she!  Don Draper would have sucked that puppy right down, lulled by the singer songwriter named Mike DeLuca, doing a slew of bar favorites, while many in the crowd sang along. He even let someone sing with him, which was beyond gracious and totally unnecessary.  It was a good crowd, a mix of Steeler fans and Sunday revelers, soaking in the gorgeous ambiance of this not-too-swanky spot.",

The staff is great - knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, totally on-point. Half-price bottles of wine on Mondays. All apps we ordered were great - the meat plate, the deviled eggs, duck tacos, yum. Hanger steak, tender and delicious with the chimichurri, and braised chicken - delicious sauce - both excellent. This place completely exceeded my expectations and I will be back.",
