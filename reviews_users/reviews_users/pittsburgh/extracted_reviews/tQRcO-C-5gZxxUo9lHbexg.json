    "text": "We've been waiting for this place to open up for almost 2 years now. We actually thought it was closed before it opened until finally we saw a new sign posted. Since we worked around the block, we thought we'd try it out for brunch.   We ordered a few items from the menu: !) 2 eggs, 2) omelette, and 3) pancakes with sausage.   we all agreed that we could all have made the 2 eggs dish. Nothing was special here. perhaps the special salt rising bread? but to no avail.  Everything seemed a bit underwhelming. Perhaps we had too high of expectations. The mujadara with rice was flavorful but it wasn't \"I want more of it\" good.  The omelette was fancy with special ingredients like radishes and asparagus. The pancakes were just average. Wish they could have done something a little special with the butter or in the batter.   We ordered the vinegar pie in the end. we didn't have a taste for rhubarb and wanted to taste the vinegar pie that tasted like an apple pie.  Not too many pie choices for a place called pie for breakfast, but it made do. It was tart at first bite but sweet in the end. Not too bad, but for $4.50 a slice?   If I were to give it a rating, I'd give it 2.5 stars. Priced a bit high for the amount of food.   You can definitely do better at Pamelas and at Square Cafe for breakfast/brunch options.",

But what made me stop ordering food here is their awful service. They deliverately discriminate people - by only caring their regular. I got literally a half portion of fries and way more tiny chunk of ham compared to the frequenter right next to me. Never visit here unless you're willing to open your wallet only for them.",

    "text": "I got the omelette with Swiss, asparagus, and ham and it was okay but definitely not the best it could be for $10. The salt rising bread toast was a single piece of toast which was kind of small from what I had imagined prior. The omelette tasted very buttery and the toast was also covered in butter. The omelette was tasty but I think there was a bit too much butter. They seem to be a little stingy on their serving sizes; my friend ordered the two eggs, toast, and potatoes breakfast and there were very little potatoes and a single slice of toast. The toast wasn't bad, it was pretty dense and nicely toasted. However, overall I thought it was slightly overpriced for the quantity of food they gave us. Also, i asked if i could substitute my Swiss cheese with any other cheese and they said they only had Swiss available (surprised about this!) But, my other friend got the buttermilk pancakes and they were really delicious--light, fluffy, and tasty! I think out of the 3 different meals at the table, the pancakes were the best.",

    "text": "Me and friends came for breakfast on a Saturday. We were so excited for this place, and thought they'll have lots of cool pie for breakfast. Surprisingly, they only had three pies, vinegar, chocolate moose, and peach cream. We tried the vinegar and peach cream, they're good but not outstanding. The food option was also very limited. Some restaurants give you small selection of food so everything you order is amazing, but this place was kind of disappointing. I got kale Swiss quiche for my breakfast entree, it was good but I had better for sure.  The service was NOT on point. The waitress did not check on us often, six of us were out of water for awhile. We also weren't given enough glass for water. Two of us had to share one water glass for awhile, because the waitress kept forgetting to bring us one more glass. On top of that, my boyfriend got an omelette and toast, it was very basic. It didn't come with much stuff, the omelette was mediocre and the toast was very plain. They did not give any jelly or jam, so he asked for it. In the end, they charged us the jam AND they would not let us use more than two credit cards, for six people. Probably won't come back again.",

I've tried the pork chop, meatloaf, chicken & biscuits, pancakes, and the mujadara, greens, and beet sides. The salt rising bread is a great compliment to their offerings. The only pie I've tried is the vinegar pie, which is definitely one reserved for hardcore sweet lovers. It's very sweet, and not something that I would order again. I would love to try their other pie offerings sometime. The coffee is pretty decent, and service is always good. Everything is tasty and fresh, and I love that they use local ingredients whenever they can. It's a favorite spot of mine to catch up with friends and enjoy a good meal.",

While I did not get to actually eat pie for breakfast (as there were no seasonal fruit pies available when I went) the food that I did taste was well prepared, fresh and hot. I ordered the avocado and bacon omlette, while my partner had the house cured keilbasa and eggs. He raved that this was some of the best smoked sausage he's ever tasted! (And trust me he knows meats!) Both breakfasts were accompanied by a thick slice of home made toast, and I opted for a side of cheesy grits to taste as well. I will definitely be back for some of the house made biscuits, and the braised greens which not only looked and smelled amazing, but were lauded by the friendly staff! If you're in the market for a fresh, unique and tasty take on breakfast you definitely should try some Pie for Breakfast!",

    "text": "What an interesting experience. If you enjoy good food while elbowing the strangers at the table next to you, this is the place for you. This was my first experience here and I was taken aback by some of the shortcomings of this place. The dining room is crammed with tables which means if you get lucky, you get to be in the middle of multiple conversations. In fact, it is so loud my friend and I ended up not talking to each other for most of the meal because we couldn't hear each other.  The food was good but choices were limited. The server informed us that limited substitutions and changes were allowed. The pie varieties were unique and offered us the opportunity to try a couple pies that you won't find at most bakeries or eat n park.  Though the server was nice, the coffee was lacking. There was an abundance of coffee grounds in the cup which left a bad taste in our mouths.  All that being said, we aren't opposed to returning but will consider other options in the area first.",

    "text": "First of all, Pie for Breakfast had generally good food. We had biscuits that were perfectly cooked to a golden brown and covered in luscious mushroom gravy. We also ordered eggs that were exactly over medium and flavorful breakfast potatoes. The vinegar pie was sweet, interesting, and satisfying.  Even though the food is good, it is highly unlikely that I will ever return to Pie for Breakfast. We started the morning by adding ourselves to the No Wait app. It said to check in prior to 10:05am. We arrived at 9:50am and told the hostess that we were here and the other two party members were about to arrive as well. She said we were just waiting for a table to pay and then we would be seated.   10 minutes later I asked about the status of our table and she said a few more minutes. 10 minutes later another member of our party asked what was going on. Hostess says she didn't realize our party was here and gave our table away. She isn't sure how long it will take to get us a table at this point. She offers us coffee after another member of our party speaks to her. She seemed stressed, unapologetic, and didn't seem to have any interest in communicating what the heck is happening with our table unless we continually go up to her to ask.  Almost an hour after arriving, and over an hour and a half of placing our names on the no wait app, we are finally seated. We wait and wait, hoping to get cream and sugar for our coffee. After waiting almost 10 minutes I grab a container of cream and silverware off of a stand near our table. The server finally appears and we  finally order. He's nice and it seems like our visit is finally improving. The food arrives over a period of 15 minute. Multiple items are forgotten and we keep having to ask for the different items we ordered. Portions are shamefully small. Our $3.50 potato side was given to us in a ramekin that could have been used for condiments. The salt toast is boring and feels like it needs... salt...   We have concerns with the check and they fix it right away. Nothing was good enough to go back for and it definitely wasn't worth the money or time we spent. I've heard others have better experiences with service and seating, but I can get the same quality of breakfast food at many other places for less money.",

For example, if you order peanut butter or cookies & cream or chocolate pie, you need an unsweetened or slightly sweetened whipped cream to balance out the rich taste of peanut butter or chocolate. The first time I got a fruit pie. Second time peanut butter. I felt desperate for milk or something by the end. Not a pie place to me if you can't even provide something to balance out the taste! Even a fruit pie that is too Tarty based on the season and ripeness of the fruit needs something to calm the tartiness down like whipped cream or ice cream.. hope they implement it!",

It's great that they go through yelp, as you can track where you are in line. When we were seated we were promptly served.   We each ordered the 2 eggs with home fries, salt raised bread, and bacon / ham, and everything was absolutely delicious. The home fries were appropriately seasoned and flavorful, the bacon was great. The ham was interesting, it was a thick cut and tasted closer to a pork chop than anything.   For the titular item, we ordered the vinegar pie and pear pie, which blew us away. Vinegar pie had a great apple cider flavor and sugar crust, it was very sweet. Pear pie I thought was perfect, soft, a light sweetness, flaky oat crust.",

The cakes were unusually flavorful, tasty, hot and fresh. The bacon was meaty.  The latte was delicious.  My dining companion had the Rhubarb Pie, which also was surprising in its subtly delicious tastiness. It wasn't too sweet, just enough, while definitely being scrumptiously pie-ish.  Words fail, apparently, when confronted with actual flavorful food. There were a bunch of other interesting options that i bet would be great too - choices that intrigued.  I look forward to my next visit.",

While the menu seems to favor bar drinks over brunch, there are some curious specials thrown in with a la carte brunch staples. Some of these include meatloaf and pork chops alongside omelettes and quiche. On top of this, the interior is very minimalist and largely inoffensive, which leaves the experience up to interpretation.   My girlfriend and I were told 20-30 minutes and ended up waiting 50, while some other couples coming in later took spots at the bar and windows (these were offered to them by the hostess instead of those already waiting, although it is first come first serve). Overall, the breakfast food is very standard and accessible. The home fries are flavorful with some hot sauce, and the solo slice of toast was nice and thick.   I would strongly recommend actually ordering a slice of pie (particularly peanut butter), as this was by far the highlight of our meal. Only a small piece of the menu is dedicated to this namesake item, and I truly believe they would benefit from expanding the selection - at least for weekend brunch.",

Everything is made from scratch and it feels like your favorite diner from when you were a kid. The menus is fairly limited but everything is excellent. Their portions are on the larger side, which you'll want to remember so you can save room for their pie. The pies will remind you of your grandma's. They're one of the few places who get the crust right: it's never soggy nor is it so thick you can't bite it. Try the vinegar pie. I know it sounds weird but just try it. It's like an apple pie without the apples. Seriously, try it.",

We told the host that we would take bar or table and he said he'd let us know. Two seats opened up at the bar and a couple walked by us and took them before the couple leaving put their coats on.  The host did nothing to stop them.  We then watched several parties of three and four who came in after us get seated because they save the booths for 3 or more.  So my party of two is still standing her (probably 45 minutes now) waiting for a two top or seats at the bar.  The food is good...but the service is rude and it's probably not worth the wait.

The seating area is quite small, so we weren't surprised at the wait time.  We were seated at the bar/counter after about 45 minutes waiting.  The staff is friendly, and were very attentive.  Our orders were simple, coffees, scrabbled eggs, bacon, and the omelette special.  The coffee was unremarkable, other than the scalding temperature, which made it impossible to drink (I still have a blister on the roof of my mouth from sip one).  Administration of ice dropped the temperature to endurable levels.  The omelette was delicious, though not a True omelette, more a grilled flat egg wrapped around the pepper and mushroom contents.  The best part of the omelette, however, was the superb slice of white bread toast homemade in situ.  The toast taste was memorable.  The scrambled eggs were laughable, appearing unadorned on a small plate with the bacon.  It looked a bit like someone's last meal.  The price for our meal was far too much for the meager offerings... over $30 for 2 coffees, an omelette, and the mere suggestion of eggs and bacon.  Wait time...D; food quality...A (and cool down the coffee, please), value...C.  We will not likely return.",

I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and cornbread. My wife had the char. We both enjoyed our meals. My pork was quite tasty, however a tad overcooked and chewy. The mashed potatoes were salted just a little too heavily, but otherwise were good. My favorite part of the meal was the cornbread muffin. The service was a little spotty -- friendly staff, but it felt as though the staff were still adjusting to the location and were not yet fully comfortable with the menu and the mood of the place, so that affected the service a bit. We also had the rhubarb pie, which was superb. Overall, I'd give this place a 3/5, keeping in mind that the quality will probably rise as the restaurant ages. I will definitely return once the restaurant has been open a bit longer.",

I ordered the ham and swiss quiche and it was absolutely delicious. Normally it comes with a side salad, but I subbed out for the much-discussed self-rising bread. It was the perfect amount of food for breakfast.   My husband went with the biscuits and sausage gravy. He said it tasted great, but that it was super rich. He ordered a single pancake on the side and had nothing but good things to say.   We ordered a few chocolate chip and  sugar cookies to go. Both types were amazing and we would definitely recommend. They were soft and flavorful.   As far as service and atmosphere - they jumped on the No Wait train, so we love them for that. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and the food came out relatively quickly considering the place was packed on a Saturday morning. The middle section seating is a little tight and the chairs have rounded backs, so there's no great place to throw a purse...but other than that everything was excellent.   Definitely worth a try.",

We were told it would be a half hour wait and waited about an hour to be seated. We would have gone somewhere else but at some point it becomes like...\"well we've waited this long\"....? Wish we'd left.  Server was not friendly and became increasingly rude when one of my companions was asking about vegan options. She was huffy, rolling her eyes, and obviously annoyed. I get it. Dietary restrictions can be irritating. Please consider the ppl you are talking to have just waited an hour and you ADVERTISE that you have vegan options.   My food was fine; I had steak and eggs. Nothing special but not bad. I had a mimosa that was terrible. The sparkling wine was so  flat that it was clear it was premixed and made early in morning. Disgusting. I would have asked to have t taken off if I was the kind of person who did things like that. I am not.   Other companion had food that was fine/ okay. Passable but nothing special.   Third person (the vegan) had the tofu scramble and said it was disgusting and inedible. It looked extremely gross ...it had nothing on the classic tofu scramble some of us remember from the now closed Quiet Storm. This individual sat with us while we ate and didn't eat any of her food .   Not only did server ask ZERO questions about how the food was but she scoffed\"not a fan of the scramble huh, guess you don't want it to go\" as she took the plate away.  The person was taken aback and said \"yeah it wasn't any good can you please take it off the bill?\" The server became enraged and huffed away. When she brought us the check she let us know \"no one has EVER not liked this scramble before just so you know\".   I was shocked how awful and rude this server was and although I had intended to order food to go to take my sick wife at home I abandoned that plan and went to Pamela's a few blocks away.   Would not go back.",

It's served with their made in-house salt rising bread, but sadly I can't eat it being gluten free. I get it, but I was bummed the server didn't mention subbing in something. I would have been cool with fresh fruit. I didn't ask though, so maybe next time I'll see if that can happen. I was happy to enjoy the home fries though!   The place is super cute too. I know they worked with local artist Kim Fox to design the space, including the beautiful tile work on the bar. It's seriously its own work of art! It's a small place, and we went at the height of busy time Sunday at noon. We waited probably around 1/2 hour-ish, which isn't bad at all. Things do move quickly.   They also prefer you only use 2 credit cards per order. Even if you have a large group like we did. They did split the bill, but it took a while for the server to do it. She said the system was complicated, so I felt bad! Just know if you come with a large group, cash is best.  Their website says they're cool with dietary restrictions... Which I'm glad to see. It would be nice to see them make a GF pie! I'd love to be able to sample something... From what I saw they looked delish!",

It took them a long time - long enough to wonder how long it takes to slice a pie - and there wasn't a great space to just stand and wait. the staff were friendly, just busy.  these slices of pie were more disappointing. the taste was okay, but pie crust should be flaky, buttery, and fork tender. we had to saw both slices apart with a knife and it still wouldn't break.  this place has been hyped for nearly 2 years - i lived across the street and the original sign in 2016 said \"coming in early 2017!\" then it got crossed out and said \"mid\" then \"late\" then finally opened in summer 2018. i'll come back to try the breakfast and other diner options, but the pie crust really needs work. I'm hoping I just got a bad batch of dough and that this isn't the regular.",

Quiche Lorraine was one of the first things I learned to make when I first started cooking, using the recipe in Julia Child's The French Chef Cookbook. Generally, restaurant quiche is overly eggy, and less creamy, but Pie for Breakfast gets it so very right. It's a nice, creamy quiche rather than being scrambled eggs en croute.  This week, they're having one with bacon and Hidden Hills Dairy's Temptation cheese, and I just can't get enough of it.   The service is wonderful, too. (Shout out to Ryan!)  And then there's dessert. They make this chocolate mousse pie on a graham cracker (I think) crust. I've really never had one this good. It is one of the not-so-many perfect dishes I have experienced in life. It simply could not be any better.  I'm hoping the breakfast pie wizards will turn their attention to cherry pie as cherries come into season (or, perhaps, turn to the cherry farms of Michigan). And then there's lemon chess pie. I'll bet they'd make either of those just as perfectly as they do the chocolate mousse pie.",

Over all everything was reasonably good, but it seemed odd that a place called pies for breakfast only had 3 types of pies to choose from.  My wife and my son in law got the pancakes, I had the omelette with asparagus. It was all prepared well, and came out in a reasonable time, especially for as busy as they were.  The portions are sensible, not large,  although all the sides are extra. Which I guess makes it a little on the expensive side for what it is.   If Pies is in you name, a few more pies to choose from would be in order... they have just been open a few weeks. I'll check back in a few months and see how they adjust.",

Went for breakfast and sat at the counter because it was busy within fifteen minutes of opening. Service was excellent. Had eggs, cottage bacon (didn't really know what that was; is kind of the country ham equivalent of bacon) and salt raised bread (which is an Appalachian thing that's now trendy) and, of course, pie.  Coke products - yay. Besides that, the bread and pie are outstanding. We tried the vinegar pie, which this country girl would call \"mock apple pie.\"  It is a gooey somewhat apple-y filling and the crust isn't flaky, but still delicious.   They also had shoofly and chocolate mousse pie (I think we missed rhubarb by a few days)  Two people, non-alcoholic beverages, shared pie - $30 before tip. Great deal.

My colleague and I decided to go here for lunch after much anticipation of the opening.  I ordered the 'hearty salad' for $10.  It's hearty, but the size is more on the meager side of things.  It did have nice chunks of fresh blue cheese, beets, and hard boiled eggs.  Hearty, but small.  But tasty.  My friend had the 4 oz pork chop special with two (or maybe three?) sides.    We decided to each order a different piece of pie and then share.  I ordered a rhubarb pie and after one bite did not want to share.  Then I tasted my friend's vinegar pie and I wanted to steal his piece and run.  In honor of my grandma's memory I can't say this is the best pie I ever had but I can certainly say this is by far the best pie I've ever eaten in a restaurant.  I don't even know what a vinegar pie is but somehow it is all I think about.  And the crust was made from the wings of an angel.  Thank you, Pie for Breakfast, for taking forever to open but not disappointing us.  Well worth the wait!",

From the start, we weren't given enough glasses or water for everyone. This was not address for too long during the our visit. I ordered a veggie omelette which came with a side of toast. When I asked for jelly for the toast, I was not informed of the additional charge until the check came.

The atmosphere was casual and cool, and all the servers were incredibly friendly and more than happy to answer all of our questions about the menu and the available pies that day.  My husband ordered the quiche of the day with a couple of sides - cheesy grits and mujadera (rice and lentils).  The sides won the day - they were amazing, totally tasty and flavorful.  My side of sausage was also very tasty.   Unfortunately, the thing I enjoyed least was the piece of pie I chose - the peaches and cream pie.  I had imagined it would be a peach pie with lots of fruit, but it was more of a wet pie, almost like a bread pudding consistency with some chunks of fruit in it, and it was served cold.    All in all, it was a pleasant experience - I probably would have chosen a different pie, or ordered the pancakes, which looked AMAZING.  All in all, a very worthwhile experience, and I would go back.",

We waited 15-20mins, not that bad. The host staff wasn't really attentive, and the wait staff seemed like their only priority was turning tables (not our actual experience).  Additionally, I understand not wanting to do a ton of substitutions and requests, but we had two allergies in our party and the waiter seemed so off put by having to answer our questions about the dishes. Not going to apologize for looking out for our health...  The food is a 6.5/10. Nothing too spectacular, and their prices are far too high for their step-above-diner food.",

I think it's a pretty good deal considering their other entree options don't include many sides so when you add it all together, the $18 definitely seems to be the cheaper option.  I got the fancy omelette and it was pretty good! It came with home fries which were also delicious and their thick buttery toast is to die for! My partner got the pork chop brunch special and said that the side of beans were meh but the collard greens were delicious. Our Moscow mules were super refreshing and apparently they make their own in-hour ginger beer which is pretty freaking awesome.   I hope to come here again!",

I guess I was misled by the name.  My friend got pancakes and I got the pork chop, which didn't look so much like one. However the sauce and the sides definitely created a balance of flavors on the plate. It made for a good, filling meal. It was difficult at times to get the attention of the staff, especially when we had additional requests or even when we needed to pay the bill. We walked to the register but they told us to go back and wait. The inside is quite small and a combination of booths and tables. The decoration is a bit random but not too far off from most American diners. I'm not sure if I would go back but I'm glad I got to try the place out. At least now I know whether they're True to their namesake.",

I shared the omelette and pancakes, with added pork sausage and the works (peaches and whipped cream on top).   The pancakes were the highlight of the meal. I'm not usually a pancake person but they were delicious! I loved the peaches and whipped cream topping - definitely worth adding and I 100% recommend.   The omelette was just ok. Didn't feel like it was worth the cost and the green beans were definitely an interesting filling. I felt the egg itself was thin and a little rubbery. The pork sausage was also a bit bland for my taste. Good texture but wish it was a bit more flavorful.   Would definitely come back here for the pancakes though!",

I've been a huge fan of Legume and Butterjoint so I was really excited when I heard about this place on a recent trip back to Pittsburgh!   The decor is super fun, updated diner style with metal tops and orange chairs. We signed up on the list for tables but they have first come first serve bar seats. I was a little confused about how they manage the list and people waiting and how to nab seats at the bar but I guess you just go for it.   I wanted something savory and went for the lobster omelette. Our waitress told us this omelette rotates what meats go with it based on what Legume serves. This week it was a lobster. I was presently surprised to see how much lobster came in the omelette, a bunch of giant chunks of claw meat! I feel like a lot of restaurants will skimp on meat, really appreciate that the $15 omelette really felt like I got what I paid for. The salt toast that came with was really delicious also.  Of course, because of the name, we had to get both pies available that day-rhubarb pie and vinegar pie. Both were a little too sweet for me, we weren't able to finish either, but the crust was really delicious.   We didn't order any beverages but from our view from the counter they had a great beer and liquor selection.",

We both plopped down at the bar because it was pretty full inside during lunch. We ordered Mimosas, and they were the perfect size and perfect mix (it tasted extremely fresh!). We kept seeing waiters go by with quiche so we were pretty much decided that that would be our meal. The vegetarian quiche was leaks and asparagus and we both got the potatoes as a side. WOW. What a perfect meal. I literally didn't leave a single bite. The quiche was so fluffy and had just the right amount of cheese, and the potatoes had great crispy edges. For dessert I was completely torn because all the pies sounded good. However, my friend had been there before and pushed me to get the vinegar pie. I had already decided that I would take it back to my office so I could throw it away if I didn't like it. WELL BUTTER ME UP AND CALL ME BISCUIT, because that was some of the best pie I've ever had! It's like if a mashed apple pie and a pecan pie had a baby. Sugar crust, great filling, and the perfect thing to distract you from work. I really would have that pie for breakfast. They will see my face a lot from now on!!",

Imagine an apple pie, without the apple part but just the glaze from the apples and that as the whole pie, that's what this tasted like to me! Not bad not bad! But too sweet for me. RHUBARB PIE ($4.50): Very good also. Can't compare it to the vinegar pie because they're pretty different. This one was a bit tangy and not super sweet so like a palate cleanser from the vinegar pie. CHOPPED LAMB STEAK W/ RHUBARB CHUTNEY ($12): I thought it would be an actual lamb steak but this was more like a meat loaf. Rhubarb chutney was good. Compare it to a cranberry sauce! My 3 sides were: cornbread, braised greens, and mashed potatoes!  Prices are decent for dinner! Decor is interesting, there are a bunch of mirrors on the wall.

As the restaurant's name suggests, getting their quiche ('pie') for breakfast is a very legitimate and worthwhile option. I can honestly say that I've never had quiche that was creamier or more rich! They offer meat and vegetarian options, and had so many awesome sounding dishes that I can't wait to go back and try more things. While the Middle Eastern mujaddara is a delicious side option, it didn't exactly feel like a breakfast dish. While enjoying the atmosphere, my friends and I were commenting on how they were trendy without being pretentious. They didn't waste time or energy making complicated dishes, but they did an awesome job using fresh and delicious foods to prepare an enticing and trustworthy menu. The mimosas were good - with fresh orange juice (light pulp). I will definitely find my way back here happily on a future visit to PGH.",

For such a simple sounding dish, the flavor was surprisingly stunning!  The home fries were rustic, crispy, and delicious. The salt bread, humble looking though it may be, packs serious flavor. Service was fast, friendly, and competent. The ambiance is so bright and cheerful that it's a challenge not to have a great day after coming here.

    "text": "I had a decent breakfast there with my partner that was spoiled by a poor slice of pie and an unsatisfactory response by the server when asked if I liked the rhubarb pie.  There was what appeared to be tofu scramble in the soggy crusted pie.  Gross to behold and wasn't able to be overcome by the taste (substandard).  The crumb topping was good though but nothing could be worse than the waiter's complete milk toast response which was \"oh, you didn't like it?  The white scrambled stuff in it?   I don't know, cream cheese, maybe mascarpone...) then walks away and allows me to pay for it.   I honestly wouldn't have ordered it if I knew that, it wasn't stated on the board.  It just said rhubarb pie.  I love fruit pies and appreciate that there's generally no dairy in it as I am lactose intolerant.  Just not a great experience.",

The wait time wasn't that bad compared to some of the other popular breakfast spots in the city. There aren't a lot of parking spaces outside, so i had to park in the garage across the street, so keep in mind that will add at least an extra $6 to your costs. I was impressed to see what looked like a full bar available for breakfast. Some of the breakfast meals even come with drinks....nice for brunch with friends. They also have a few vegetarian options. I ordered eggs with a side of potatoes and it came with an interesting tasting toast. The eggs and potatoes were good. I am not sure about the salt rising toast though, I cant say it wasn't good...just different. I probably would come back if i am in the area.",

We both got one of the regular pies which change throughout the week. There were 3 options so we decided on the chocolate mousse pie! This isn't a traditional pie with a dough crust, but it is one DELICIOUS pie for sure! They also have fruit pies!   Then, I got the 2 eggs with bacon, Anandama toast, and mujadara. I have never heard of or tried the last two sides so I was excited! Anandama toast is a salt-rising bread toast so it is very thick yet has a slight molasses sweetness. It was SO perfect paired with butter, my eggs and the mujadara which was a lentil curry-flavored rice!   My boyfriend got the two buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips which of course, was thick and drool-worthy! The staff was friendly and the decor inside is cute: mirrors, bright colors, booths, tables, window seats, and a bar! Next time, I will definitely have to try one of the coffee cocktails!",

I went during breakfast time and I ordered their omelette. Personally, I'm not a big fan of American breakfast food, but it's not bad. The omelette I ordered had asparagus in it which may seem odd at first. ASPARAGUS? In an omelette?? I wasn't sure whether I should eat it plain or with ketchup. It was definitely a bit more watery than a regular omelette. It was green. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The egg was fine, just the asparagus in it that made me confused. Oh well  VERDICT:  Would I order the omelette again? Probs not   Would I go back again? Only if you ask me to",

The quiche tasted good (it was something with ramps and potatoes and something else I think?) as did the mujadara (good but had weird hard bits like stale rice), but overall this place has enough things I dislike that I probably wouldn't come back.   First off, the pies are good and worth trying as well as the quiche and omelettes, but beyond those much of the menu just feels like a overcharged oilier version of easy breakfast items I could make for myself. Second, everything here is really really oily. It's all fine and good when you start eating, but both my friend and I left feeling quite nauseous from the heavy food.",

It's the same ownership as Legume and Butterjoint next door, so they launch with a lot of expertise and resources.   There are a lot of great items on the menu, for example Salt-Rising Bread. I don't know too many places that serve it, although this traditional Appalachian offering is making a comeback, and you should order here to find out why.  I was somewhat critical of the $3.50 price for a side of grits, however when I looked up the $90 wholesale cost for a 20 lb bag of Anson Mills Grits, I can see why the price is that high.   My Omlette of the Day was Kimchi, and it certainly packed flavor.   They use Commonplace Coffee, which is a great choice.   Gwen was our server and she was helpful and attentive. I don't see how anyone can wrong here.",

It was lovely and warm for the first bit or two, but the center was cold - a bad reheat job or something.  It would have been top notch if not for that.    - The prices.

But since everybody says you need to try it, my friend and I ordered a slice of it along with a slice of apple pie for breakfast.  Well, more specifically breakfast dessert.  Yes, I know the name of the place is Pie for Breakfast.  And for that reason alone I have been wanting to stop by since they opened.  But they have a good looking menu with lots of other sweet and then savory options.   As soon as I opened the menu, though, I knew what I wanted: the minute steak with eggs and sides of grits and side salad.  The salad was mixed greens tossed in a vinaigrette.  The grits were creamy.  The eggs were dippy.  And they all went perfectly with that steak and met all my high expectations.    To top it off, the vinegar pie was a delightful treat.  It was sweet but not too sweet.  Much better than I imagined it would be.  The apple pie was solid.  But yeah, that vinegar pie is a must.  They offer some fancy drinks (coffee, cocktails, beer) but I stuck with water and coffee.  The interior isn't very big but they make it work with a smaller space.  It's got a cozy diner feel that I liked, too.  Prices weren't outrageous for the portions and quality.

When I heard the restaurant name \"Pie For Breakfast\", I thought.. typical Midwest having pie for breakfast - I'm from Ohio. Then I thought, well maybe \"Pie For Breakfast\" means \"Pizzas For Breakfast\" - that sounds delicious. I was wrong.. it is literally pies for breakfast. BUT I was not disappointed.  PFB reminds me of an old 50s dinner with an edge. It has amazing vegetarian options and quite a spread. I ordered the vegetarian biscuits and mushroom gravy - yummy! The portion was perfect and not too heavy. For dessert for breakfast I got pie! I ordered the Vinegar Pie and OMPie it was delicious! I love vinegar, pickles, sour everything! But the vinegar pie wasn't too sour its was just DELICIOUS! Do you think PFB will deliver to Hawaii?",

The tables are very close together (and some people like that). I know that if they were farther apart the wait would be longer. So not saying I would change that, just saying why I didn't give that 5th star. Our server was terrific. She explained items we weren't familiar with and offered suggestions. We settled on the grits, beans and greens and the quiche of the day. We also got toast with homemade jelly. YUM! We ordered pie-but, had to take it to go. DELICIOUS!! Not too sweet with perfect spice and lots and lots of apples. I definitely recommend using the YELP call-ahead feature. We had no wait when we got there. Will be back for sure!!",

It was packed! Which I find as good sign; I love seeing new business crowded. The hostess took our name and told us it would be about a thirty minute wait, but a few minutes she informed us three seats were available at the bar, which we gladly took.  This restaurant is small and adorable. All the staff were very friendly. Only fault was that even though we were sitting at the bar my coffee never got refilled.   I ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy. They did not disappoint! Definitely a must try. The biscuits are full of flavor, flaky, and moist. While the gravy smothers them they don't get soggy.   I surprised to see that this modern dinner services alcohol. They had some of the brunch standards like Mimosas and such. They also had a small collection of liquors and beers behind the bar, a lot being local to PA.  Not only did Pie for breakfast have local alcohol they sourced a lot of their menu locally as well. All their meat entrees are made with meat produced in PA.  I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!",

I came in with two friends at around 1:00PM.  It was very crowded but luckily, there were three seats at the bar. The food came out in a timely manner.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy and a piece of vinegar pie. The biscuits and gravy were delicious!! The biscuits reminded me of the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster. They were crisp outside and didn't get soggy because of the gravy. The gravy itself was excellent, I finished my whole plate without hesitation. The sausage chunks are big enough and left me full.   The vinegar pie is DELICIOUS. The best pie I've had in awhile. Like previous reviews, I'd compare it to pecan pie without the nuts. The filling was similar to pecan pie however, more tangy because of the vinegar. The crust was delicious- very buttery and flaky. I'm so happy I tried this place. I was tempted to get another piece of pie however, I decided not to because I didn't want to get sick of the food.   I left satisfied and wanting more. I can't wait to come back!!   Updated: went in today to try their cookies and cream pie. It was tasty, kind of a cheesecake like pie. It was very rich and similar to the Burger King Hershey sundae pie. The vinegar pie still is my favorite.",

The space is not big at all similarly to the sibling restaurants Legume and Butterjoint right next door. But a different vibe for sure! You have to be seated for tables and booths however the counter is first-come first-serve. Since there were just two of us, we waited for the counter and waited approximately 10-15min. I ordered two pancakes and a side of bacon. The pancakes were some of the fluffiest I had ever eaten-- perfect! And the bacon was delicious! The coffee was great as well; it's Commonplace Coffee. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. I'll be back time and time again to try different things on the menu especially the pie because well, it's in the name people!",

The \"sister\" restaurants of Legume and Butterjoint are fantastic, so I figured that anything from the same chef would be amazing.  Unfortunately, the 2 times I've eaten here have been disappointing, and I can't recommend it.    Generally, the food is fine... but just that.  You won't find a hearty breakfast here -- the portions are sadly meager -- but neither will you find a unique take on diner food.   The breads were great, eggs were just ok.   The coffee was only so-so -- a real miss given the number of great coffee roasters in Pittsburgh.   Like a few other reviewers, I also found the pies to be lacking.  Heavy dough, weak flavors, nothing special.   I think this place could be a real gem, but they have to decide what they want to be: a classic diner with hearty fare to start your day, or a special eatery that reaches the same level as Legume.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant as many others have for quite a long time. I am hopeful that my experience was due to just opening and not a precursor of things to come.   The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu however there were problems when it came to asking about items being vegetarian. I ordered two sunny side up eggs, salt toast, hash browns and coffee. The server did not bring, or ask, if cream or sugar was needed nor bring them. Eventually I was brought creamers but had to ask the people at the next table for their sugar. I also had to flag down the server for jam or jelly. The toast and hash browns had a definite mouth feel and taste of animal fat. I asked the server about this so she went to ask the chef. She returned to tell me they used clarified butter. A fairly lame excuse. Clarified butter does not make food take on the flavor and mouth feel of lard. I went on to order the salt bread toast. It was served with a raspberry coulis, something that I would have appreciated with my first order and which was quite good. The toast is grilled so again the distinct flavor of animal fat, particularly lard, was front and center. Front of house came to ask how things were and I asked why the flavor of animal fat was so distinct as I was told my items were vegetarian by both the server and the chef. I asked if the grill was being used for vegetarian and non vegetarian items, which it is. The grill is quite small and I was told that there is no divider to separate the foodstuffs. So you may order hash browns that are grilled in the same area where bacon was just removed. It's definitely something that needs to be rectified and I have faith that it will.",

Excellent in taste and served hot. The side potatoes would have been great as well, however they came to our table barely lukewarm so that's a minus. Pancake was raw in the middle - we sent that one back and received a cooked one, free of charge. As far as the negatives go... our estimated wait time was 30 minutes, which we were fine with however the actual wait to be seated was over an hour. Had we known that, we would have decided not to have breakfast here on this day. Also, they served a cappuccino in a drinking glass so the lack of an insulated glass made the drink very hot to hold onto at first and then allowed it to get cold pretty quickly. We may give this place another try during a not so busy time but find it hard to recommend at this time.",

The toast was dense and soft and unique, and I highly recommend getting it as a side no matter what you order. I also had a slice of the vinegar pie to round out my breakfast, and it was gooey and sweet and had a hint of tartness from the vinegar. The peaches and cream pie, which was ordered at my table as well, was much less sweet than the vinegar pie, but was creamy and tasted entirely homemade - no canned peaches here. My friend ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy, which I tasted, and they were savory and warm and very delicious. The menu is still small as they work out the kinks and find their footing, but it's a really cute place and it's evident that there is a lot of love put into the food and service.",

We could not hold a conversation, It was very warm.  Albeit, it was hot outside.  The food was average, at best.  I had eggs and a pancake.  The pancake was tough, eggs were fine, not anything special.  We had pie at the end of the meal which was the high point. Hope that they improve.  It's a good location in Oakland.",

Went in for lunch on a weekday with my boyfriend, and we got a meat pie to start, I got the omelette and he got the pork chops.  Meat pie was cold, which surprised me.  The crust was good, but the filling, nothing special.  The omelette was filled with peppers, peas and tomatoes, as advertised, but I didn't get any of the herb taste.  Also lacking in flavor.  My boyfriend's pork chops were also OK, but nothing amazing.  The coffee was good though, probably the best thing we got.  Probably won't go back anytime soon.",

New and trendy, full bar at 9am Sunday morning, and very fluffy pancakes!  All score check marks in the win column.  However the full bar was a little bit of a put off, especially after witnesses the wait staff \"sample a drink right before serving said drink to a customer\". Yeah, the did the finger vacuum straw thing to check the \"consistency\" of the drink, but still a little put off.  Although this is a \"trendy\" vibe place, I was surprised to see they didn't offer any alternatives with breakfast meats outside of ham or bacon.  The menu was certainly targeted to a more \"brunch-like\" fare than True breakfast, but hey...it's new and trendy.  A solid 3 stars...I may try again, but if first impressions are the True lasting ones...then I'll sure I won't make a \"special trip\".",

Though, side-note to all restaurants -- PLEASE take reservations; like, real ones. Anyway, after the wait, we were seated amongst the lovely tables, counter and booths (though the super cute chairs were super uncomfortable) and greeted by our friendly server. From start to finish, our experience took a cool two and a half hours. I was amongst friends, so truly, this did not bother me. What got a little dicey was the wait for food since, apparently, they only have four burners and that posed a challenge for all the egg orders -- and the time it took to get our change which was so lengthy, the place was nearly empty by the time we left. Our server was TRYING, but it really felt like the restaurant in general is not prepared for a group of this size. In any case, the food is decent, the place is cute and the pie (I hear) is amazing. I'd suggest bringing ONE friend and arriving early.",

I was surprised that they actually only have 3 types of pie on their menu and when we went they were out of one.  Have no fear they still have plenty of yummy options including muffins, cookies and a full breakfast menu.  This place is small so I do not recommend it for large groups. We had seven in our party and waited over an hour to be seated.  Our waitress was flustered by our large group and could not separate checks well nor split up payments so this presented a problem.  The food also took a long time to come out as they only have 4 burners and most of us ordered eggs so it took a long time for them to cook.  I went with 2 scrambled eggs with toast, home fries and I added on the cucumber salad. Everything was extremely tasty including the cucumber salad-light and refreshing with a pickled flavor.  The toast is on a homemade bread which was delicious but I was disappointed they only gave us 1 piece.  A few in our party ordered pie for dessert and the vinegar and chocolate pie (thicker moose) were favorites.",

I'm not really sure what genre of food this is - maybe southern homestyle with an international twist? But it was awesome.

Pork Chops with Stewed Rhubarb along with three sides - Mashed Potatoes, Black-Eyed Peas and Rice Pilaf. The dinner was delivered quickly and my meal was awesome! I am a big fan of pork chops and they were cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were especially done well - with just the right consistency, texture and a great home-style taste. Yes, I do recommend \"Pie for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner\"!!  :-)   Dillon told me that they will be open until Midnight during the week on a consistent basis.

But it seemed like three different locations in one place. While this could work, I felt no balance, and the place itself seemed too small to offer that many services. I sat next to other patrons with about an inch between our tables, and the menu that day said that it was shortened on that specific day. My party ordered two dishes... The biscuits and gravy and a very complex omelette. The omelette was expensive... I believe it was 12 dollars on its own for a small omellete and one piece of their special toast... But the toast was so burnt, all I could taste was the rock hard burnt nature of it. The omelette itself was overwhelming... Grier, an incredibly overpowering pesto, and asparagus... Several unique, and delicious sounding, but overwhelming ingredients. Ultimately, all it tasted like was pesto. It reminded me of these modern, new wave restaurants that feature specialized and crafted recipes. On the other hand, we also ordered the biscuits and gravy... They were so simplistic it was bland. Dense, heavy biscuits in a gravy that was unseasoned or at least underseasoned and the sauce itself was more of a liquid than a thick gravy. To me... After that intense, specialized omelette, I would expect the other dishes to have the same feeling... But the other dish we tasted was immensely unimpressive.",
