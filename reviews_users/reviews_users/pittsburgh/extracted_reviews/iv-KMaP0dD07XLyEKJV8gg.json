For the traditionalist, the chicken is served as tenders/planks - not on the bone. Alcohol is available for those who desire a nip with their meal. Another item of note; NO CASH - credit/debit cards only.  Atmosphere is very relaxed with a good amount of seating and TVs playing sports.  We tried the tenders, chicken-n-waffles and the salad which were all awesome. PS - the damn hot flavor lives up to its name!  Go to place for hot chicken when in the 'Burgh.",

They are big portions so you'll definitely get your money's worth, but if you want some juicy chicken it can be quite inconsistent. I've tried mild, medium, and hot so far, but it seems like sometimes the medium is a hot while other times it tastes like a mild. However, the waffles are very soft and tasty -- just not great when the oil from the chicken gets soaked in there if you are saving some leftovers. I love their sauce and I think I might even like it better than my all time favorite Chick-fil-A sauce! All in all, the hype around this place is warranted because of their aesthetic appeal, drafts, and local craft beers. I definitely will try some of their beers later!",

Not a knock, just informing. Its busy, crowded, and loud and uncomfortable seating with no backs..communal tables and a few booths.  The food was good, but fast-food good. I had the salad which was fresh, no complaints for what its is..fresh fast food. All the food looked very good.

They give you a round pager and you place it on the little card sensor at the edge of your table..pretty high tech. so they know where you are. The sandwich has alot of seasoning on it and I was thankful I only got mild. It also has coleslaw and a thousand island type dressing which is good because it takes some of the heat away but it was delish and cooked to my liking. ( they don't play with the heat so I would suggest taking it slow at 1st) The mac and cheese was thick but good.  Would go back if I was in the area but not make a special trip.",

Its service is fast, and they use an electronic system to deliver it to your table. And its chicken's spice level is POIGNANT! If you want to feel a smoldering, rising pain in your mouth after consumption, get the Hot or Extra Hot. Otherwise, stick to the lower spice level, because they have some tremendously spicy chicken! Overall, the flavor is rich, and the price is good! Highly recommend!",

Wooo my tongue burns still so medium is definitely not for the faint of heart. How do ppl go beyond medium?!? Will need to try their sandwich and fries next time we're in Pitt!

Medium is getting there for sure, more like most buffalo style heat but just a different kind of heat. Fries rocked, fingers were very nice sized . Wished I could have remembered to ask for more dipping sauce because it was very good. Clean and people were nice . I saw they had some decent drafts as well. I will go back to try the hotter stuff.",

Service was fast and friendly and the menu has enough options to be satisfying but not so many that you feel overwhelmed. Prices are average no compliments or complaints. I got the salad... note I think it's the only \"healthy-ish\" thing on the menu so I'm not sure exactly what the health conscious do here... they do stress the antibiotic free chicken cooked in peanut oil ie the chicken is fried but, you know, the healthiest kind but for the most part this place is for chicken lovers. I found the amount of chicken in the salad to be reasonable, the dressing to be perfect and the overall taste delicious. I probably would skip the celery next time but that's a matter of personal taste. Not giving five stars because I can't honestly say it was the best chicken I have ever tasted but it was definitely quite tasty. Breakfast is half off from 7 to 11 in May so I'll be back!",

I have had the well known  Hattie B's Nashville hot chicken and was hoping it was going to be something comparable. CHiKN has multiple levels of spice I had the hot it was spicy but not too spicy if I would go back I would try the damn hot. The restaurant was packed but there was confusion everywhere. Some of the tables were not clean and the fountain drinks all tasted terrible. My group all paid  the fountain drinks but couldn't drink them because they tasted so bad. We ended up drinking water. The wait time for the food was long we ate inside. When the food did arrive it was good the fries were  hot not soggy. The chicken had a nice spice to it and was still hot so that was a plus but the Mac and cheese was cold and all stuck together had the potential to be good. I would give it another try maybe they have to work out some kinks but there needs to be less confusion with staff and a cleaner environment. I understand it's Oakland but for a newer restaurant they need to step their game up.  Things to know:  They do not accept cash - cards only  Music is loud & not censored - for me not an issue I enjoyed the music but some might care.  They serve alcohol",

The service was also friendly and their electronic table delivery system was smooth.   The food itself was just ok, though. The heat all came from a dry rub. On the fries, this was fine, but it was unappealing on the sandwich when I didn't get any sauce or slaw in the bite. It tasted grainy.   Overall, I'd come back if someone else wanted to or if I was in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.   PS - They don't take cash, only cards. I personally didn't mind, but it is an odd quirk",

Food-wise, the scale of spiciness guarantees that you're able to come here with friends of many different spice tolerances! The chicken itself is tender and moist, with no issues on the cook. My only concern would be the amount of salt in the seasoning-- okay in a sandwich where you have other flavors to balance it out, but harsh for individual tenders. The coleslaw was crisp, the bread fluffy but not soggy, and it was a delicious meal overall!  Waffles and fries looked to be standard fare.   Note that they don't accept cash, and get very busy on Friday nights! Seating is pretty limited during those times, but service is very fast.",

    "text": "I've been to CHiKN quite a few times and I find the food pretty tasty. However, my trip there over my lunch break was kind of a turn off. I went before the lunch rush so it was pretty empty which was cool since I needed to be in and out. As I approached the counter to order, there were two cashiers, one of which were turned away from the counter on her phone and the other who was so far into her phone that she couldn't see over her hat to see me standing there. Once I was greeted by the cashier who turned around, she promptly took my order and was very pleasant. Cool. So as I am waiting for my food, a guy in the grill section was carrying out a phone conversation. I thought to myself, \"well, they're not busy so whatever\" BUT this same guy ends his phone call and proceeds to stick his gloved hands in his pocket, then starts handling food with those same gloved hands! Maybe I'm being extra but that's kind of gross. I think back on all the times I've been there and this a common thing. People eating behind the counter, carrying out phone conversations and I wonder, does this place have any management???  Needless to say, I probably won't be back for a while.",

The tenders were seasoned to perfection and the fries were good and warm. I am not a spicy person but the mild was just right for me and I probably could have gone up a spice level for an added kick.

First off don't let the crowd of people waiting for their food deter you away from trying this place out. We waiting less than 10 minutes until our food arrived! (Around 7 on a Thursday night) Beware seating is pretty limited.   I wanted to try something more unique so I went for the Chicken and Waffles and was pleasantly surprised but felt like something was missing. I wish there had been a bit more maple syrup and I feel like honey mustard dipping would've been the perfect addition to this dish: The chicken itself was really good, juicy and crunchy.   I would be careful about how much spice you decide to get! A friend got hot and his chicken virtually inedible. I stuck with Southern (no spice) which I enjoyed a lot. Mild was good too!   Reminds me of Bird on the Run or a gourmet chick fil-a. Worth trying this place out but I wouldn't say it's an amazingly different than any other chicken restaurant I've been to.",

They have a limited menu and everything is chicken based, duh. I ordered the Chicken sandwich and wanted to try damn hot, since my spice tolerance is pretty good. The cashier cautioned that medium itself can be quite hot and so I decided to go with hot. My verdict - the hot is what I'd consider medium, but I can imagine why they'd be considered hot for others. The sandwich itself was decent and the chicken crispy, would have preferred a better bun. Overall, it was quick and you get a decent quality chicken sandwich and the price is reasonable too.   I however was not a fan of their to-go box for the chicken sandwich. The box is meant for nugget like items. The sandwich is quite large and trying to eat it out of the box wasn't the most convenient.",

    "text": "Holy shit is this chicken hot! I a am normally a huge fan of spicy food but the medium left a persistent burning in my mouth that was hard to get rid of.  Definitely order one level down what you would normally like in terms of spice level.  If medium is this hot then mild must be pretty spicy too. Normally on a 1-10 scale I usually get about a 7 but this tasted like a 9/10 level of spice. I liked that there were options for tenders, sandwich, chicken and waffles or a chicken salad and a few sides to choose from such as fries or mac n cheese.  Service was prompt and there was plenty of seating. Would have liked the chicken to be slightly crispier though.",

    "text": "Well, I was warned. I like very spicy things from time to time so when I heard this place had Pittsburgh's spiciest sandwich, I had to give it a try. I got the damn hot (spiciest level) sandwich and a hot one for comparison. The flavors on both were excellent and the hot was very good. As for the damn hot.. I'm still working my way through it right now. I'm halfway done and while it's not ghost pepper or reaper level spicy, it is VERY spicy. Prepare yourself with milk if you haven't got a tolerance for heat, and some Pepto bismol for stomach cramps. I will say definitively I haven't had a spicier sandwich but if you'relooking for good flavor go with the hot, the damn hot is more of a novelty but if that's your thing, check it out!",

Usually it's just sauce, but I was super bummed today to be missing a side of mac and cheese for the second time out of a handful of times we've gotten take out.  Guess we should have learned by now to check our boxes before leaving with our food.  I've also noticed the past few times we've gone, the chicken is less and less heavily seasoned, which is what distinguishes Nashville style hot chicken from just regular spicy tenders. And this also means less spicy. My bf got the medium tenders today and found them quite mild, while my hot tenders were less spicy than the medium used to be.  The chicken itself was still tasty, but I hope the heat can be cranked up again - being able to get legitimately HOT chicken is what makes this place really unique. Also, I'll definitely check my food before taking it to go from now on, but hopefully some kind of system can be worked out to avoid forgetting parts of orders as often.",

The mild is good too for those who don't want much heat. Love getting a beer with chicken...great combo. Plenty of room to sit. Very chill atmosphere here.

The mild was perfect. The line is long-but, well worth it. Go at an off time and you might not wait as long. They have seating both upstairs and down. (I got elbowed out of a seat by a very pushy woman. But, she had nothing to do with the restaurant!) Get the 3 piece strips-lots of chicken; a good hardy meal. I want to try the salad and sandwich too. All in good time. They do not take cash which I found interesting. OK...got to get the sauce of my fingers and get back to my chicken. See you there!",

I got the 3 piece chicken tenders (medium spicy) with fries and boy those 3 pieces are worth it! I promise after those 3 pieces and fries and a drink you'll be good to go!   Besides the food, I like that they have outlets with USB ports by the tables! So smart & convenient. Wish every restaurants will have this in the future whether it's in a college campus or not!",

Parking in Oakland can be a challenge but luckily this restaurant is just two blocks away from a parking garage on Meyran \"Forbes/Semple Garage\".  I heard the \"hot\" was unbearable, so I ordered a \"medium\" chicken sandwich and was told by the gentleman that rang up my order that their medium was really hot too.   I still went for it - because I love hot n spicy food.  Within the first bite - I can feel that my lips will be numb after eating the sandwich lol ..   it was a great-n hearty sandwich. WARNING:  \"medium\" is very hot.  I loved the coleslaw on the sandwich. I am a fan of crinkle cut fries and when they arrived looked appetizing but were so bland! I had to dress them up with a lil pepper n ketchup.  The mac n cheese we liked.  My boyfriend got the mild sandwich and loved it.  Cards only NO cash.   *PROS:   *Small Menu: I like the fact that the menu is small - you know everything is fresh (well at least you hope).   *Spacious seating *Good service - with ordering and the food came fast.  *CONS:  Extremely loud music:  We could have done without the loud rap music that was playing.   I like rap like most but the volume was a bit extreme and we couldn't wait to get out of there to have a conversation.   *Expensive for a chicken sandwich *No sides of bbq sauce offered?!",

    "text": "Good crispy chicken strips. Very flavorful seasoning. It's a gem in Oakland bc not a lot of fast food restaurants will not serve beers in Oakland. So glad to be able to sit down and grab a quick delicious meal with a beer. Despite how many customers there are, the service had been pretty prompt and friendly. I've tried the spicy and extra spicy sandwich and waffles. If you cannot do spicy, I suggest you go w mild or medium. Their spices are not to be joked with... it will sit in your stomach for two days...  haven't tried their sides but excited to go back for more! They do not serve bone in chicken, just one type of chicken strips in various styles- sandwich, waffles, or just plain strips.",

    "text": "I dropped in on a Thursday night, and place is as always very popular and packed! Regardless, we were able to find seating because of the quick turn around of people finishing their meals.  I ordered fries and chicken and waffles - I was super impressed with the chicken waffles. The waffles were absolutely delicious: a blend of savory sweet. The honey butter definitely shines, but I think the best part was the bits of salt crystals within the waffles that provided texture and worked very well with the chicken (which was mild flavored and much more flavorful than \"southern\").  The fries, although I liked them, tasted very healthy and very underseasoned (and unevenly distributed), which is disappointing because the fries with seasoning tasted pretty good!  Overall chicken and waffles were a hit and will be one of my go-to orders when I return.",

The decor of this place makes it seem nicer than your typical fried food joint. I had the chicken sandwich with fries at a medium level heat. My friend had the hot level and she said it was pretty spicy. Our food came out pretty quickly. The sandwich was HUGE. I am glad, because definitely on the higher end of prices for essentially fast food. The chicken was juicy and crispy and had a nice blend of spices on it. The medium was perfect for me. It had some heat, but did not overpower the chicken. The crinkle cut fries went well with the dipping sauce which was a combo of ketchup, mayo, and spices. Overall, a welcome addition to Oakland. A great place to go if you are craving some fried chicken!",

    "text": "Full disclosure: My first visit was a post-MRI treat and a Mediterranean diet cheat meal, so there was a lot riding on this outing!  The restaurant is shiny and new on the inside. I ordered a chicken sandwich meal with a spice level of \"hot,\" crinkly fries, and lemonade. The cashier warned that the spice levels are a step up from usual spice, so she steered me to medium level spice. I obliged.   The order was 11.21 total.   My order arrived at my table before I was done grabbing napkins and utensils - Impressive. And the sandwich. My goodness, the sandwich!!!  It was sizable and appealing to the eye. The first bite was superb - great blend of spices and the cole slaw and pickles provided a wonderful contrast to the heat. In certain bites, I thought the chicken was too salty, but overall the flavor is a win!  The fries were well-seasoned and crisp.  The medium wasn't all that spicy to me, so I'll level up next time I pay a visit.   I didn't opt for a beer this time, but I think a nice, cold can of Rhinegeist or bottle of Purple Haze would brighten this otherwise excellent meal.   Needless to say, I'm happy to have CHiKN as an option when in Oakland. What a great addition!",

They also have a full bar and can make you drinks when you order. This must be new, because when I ordered a vodka soda the waitress looked at me like I had 4 eyes. All good though, it's a new restaurant I expect the quirks. The food was good, I had a medium chicken sandwich and the chicken was perfect! The fries on the side however were a bit bland. Ambiance was fun and music was bumping, I'll be back!",

They have chicken sandwiches with pickles, slaw, some kind of sauce and you pick the level of heat of which there are 5 levels. They also have chicken fingers and fries and homemade cookies. There are 2 levels of seating.  I chose the medium heat chicken sandwich. It was good and savory and had just enough heat without feeling like you were being burned alive. I did think my chicken could have been a little more moist.  I like this chicken shack and would want to try higher heat selections each time I go with their homemade cookies.",

    "text": "Ok. I really liked this place when they first opened. I wrote a rave review about how much I liked it. My most recent visit left me highly disappointed.   I ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken and waffles combo. When I went to fill my drink, the area by the fountain drinks and utensils smelled rancid. It smelled like old garbage that college kids left in a room with the heat on all summer. When I filled my cup with coke, it came out as seltzer with little syrup. They fixed it. Cool. But the smell was still there.   I got the food to go, which, especially with the chicken and waffles, I do not recommend. When you stay it's loaded with syrup and crack butter. This time it was packaged a bit differently and there was syrup on my fries (which I love) but not on the chicken or waffles and no butter!!! Maybe I never noticed before because of the butter but the waffle tasted worse than the kind you make at hotel buffets. The chicken tasted different than usual but was still okay. The real killer was the fries. Some were fine but most had that weird stale potato taste. I hope it was just an off day. Time will tell and I'll update again next visit.",

    "text": "I've never been to Nashville, so I don't quite have the proper context for Nashville hot chicken. But I do know that it is supposed to be painfully spicy. So when asked how hot I wanted my chicken sandwich, there was really only one thing I could say.  \"Damn hot!\"  Which is when then nice woman behind the cash register offered me a warning.  Her: Have you ever been here before? Me: No, but I'm from upstate New York.   To me, that made a lot of sense. But apparently it doesn't to everyone. Regardless, she put in my order, and I received a chicken sandwich which was truly damn hot. It was angry hot. But it was also fantastically delicious.   Food this spicy demands your attention and respect. You eat it slowly. Chew it thoroughly. And appreciate all the textures and sensations of the dish. Otherwise, it will kick you in the back of the throat.  Did I sweat?  You bet.  My face also turned a deeper shade of red. But in part that was because it was pretty warm in the upstairs dining area. We were there with some kids, and wanted to be a bit out of the way.  I wish I could say everyone else enjoyed their meals as much as I did. The less hot chicken has a sweetness to the coating that my daughter found unappealing. The plain chicken strips were fine, but were missing a wow factor. Chicken and waffles could use crispier waffles, but that's all besides the point. Mac and cheese was just too rich to be enjoyable, even in small quantities, and even to kids who love cheesy goo.  Go to CHiKN for the damn hot chicken sandwich, or go home. If it turns out that it's too hot for you to eat, at least you can say that you tried.",

    "text": "Out with the taco and gourmet burger craze, and in with the fried chicken! Seriously, I feel like Nashville hot chicken is having a moment right now. It seems like every two seconds another chicken place is popping up, and that's a-okay with me!  ChiKN's menu is fairly small and focuses on chicken (duh)...sandwiches, tenders, and some standard sides. I've been twice so far, and it didn't disappoint. The first time, I ordered tenders at spice level medium with a side of mac and cheese. When I asked for medium spice, the cashier warned that medium was very spicy....I guffawed and told her I'm sure I can handle it (I mean, it's only the midpoint of their scale, how hot could it be?) Welp, turns out I'm not the spice hero I thought I was, because the medium pretty much burned off my eyebrows and had me sweating like a snowman at a sauna as I powered through my meal. Heat aside, the food was stellar! The chicken was juicy, the breading was crisp, and the seasoning was super flavorful. The mac and cheese was also a standout, with a tangy, sharp white cheddar sauce that was a welcome relief to balance out Dante's Seventh Circle of Hell inside my mouth after a bite of chicken.   Given my first experience with the heat level that was admittedly too spicy for me, I recently returned for a second visit (which was probably 6 weeks or so after the first) and ordered the same meal at one level down (mild). The food was still killer, but sadly, the spice pendulum swung way in the other direction.....pretty much no heat at all! I'm not sure if they've adjusted their spice scale since my first visit, or if it's just inconsistencies in the chefs, but it's disappointing to not be able to predict what kind of heat you're going to get. That being said, the chicken is still friggin delicious, spicy or not, so I'll certainly be returning for spice roulette again soon!  One quick note about ambiance -- both times I was there they were playing pretty loud rap/hip-hop music that included some choice words (let's just say these weren't the clean, radio-friendly version of the songs!) I personally couldn't care less, but if you have young kiddos or other folks with you who would be offended by that, you might want to steer clear.",

Ratings and descriptions below:  Chicken sandwich- hot; 4.3/5 Ample heat, moist chicken breast, and a tangy coleslaw on brioche fill out a pretty amazing sandwich. Heat level of \"Hot\" has a spice that you can enjoy while eating, yet doesn't leave a lingering sting. If I had to offer one improvement, I wish the breading was crispier.   Mac n cheese; 4.6/5 The Mac n cheese is a standout on the menu. A rich and thick white cheese sauce over elbow macaroni is topped with some colorful paprika, and tastes just about as good as it gets, although I could see how someone may think it's too thick.   French fries; 3.5/5 The French fries are crinkle-cut and also seasoned with a spice blend. Seeming to be of the priorly frozen variety, they were crispy and seasoned well, but uninspired.   Ambiance; 4.2/5 The building itself is large, with ample seating downstairs accompanying the counter and kitchen, and upstairs is a large TV and more seating. There seemed to be about 10 beers on tap and a hearty selection of bottles. While we took our food to-go, you wouldn't have to twist my arm to come back and eat-in.   Service; 4.7/5 Fast and efficient. The cashiers were taking orders and also bussing tables and wiping counters, while the cooks were busy whipping up your meal in plain sight. These people were rapid-fire cranking out orders. We went in on a Tuesday evening, but it was fairly busy. Kudos to them.   Value; 4.4/5 This place does not accept cash, which is no biggie (rewards points on credit cards, duh), and the menu was fairly priced with decent sized portions.   Later, raters! -Pat",

Third, the service was speedy. Finally, the food was good! My husband ordered the hot chicken sandwich which was delicious but FAR to hot for me. I ordered the chicken salad at medium heat. The chicken was crispy and flavorful and the salad was super fresh. I loved the green beans. We will be back!",

The first time was at Medium and while I had been warned, they were a little too hot for me. The next time I went, I got Mild and it was nice to be able to taste the flavoring of the batter along with some spice. In my opinion, anything higher than Medium, you only got spice and no flavor. The chicken is white meat and tastes fresh. The sauce they give you is delicious; in fact, I can't eat the chicken without it! They do a have bar here if you're looking for some alcohol or beer which is definitely different from other places in Oakland. It has less of a bar vibe and more of fast good vibe.  Aside from the food and drinks, the vibe in here is super chill and young. Hip-hop was playing each time I went in. As you can imagine, this is a spot for college students. There's lower level seating as well as seating upstairs. If you look on the walls, there are not only outlets, but outlets with USB ports. Simple and genius, ya'll. They know who they're trying to attract, and I'm a fan!",

The Stack'd folks certainly know what they're doing with this place.  Shared a sandwich and fries with my boyfriend. We got medium heat which would be comparable to hot elsewhere.  The chicken was juicy, tender and full of flavor. Slaw on the side instead of on sammy as that's how I prefer it.  Pickles are crisp and tasty.  Crinkle cut fries, my fave, cooked to perfection.  Can't wait to go back. I'm in love!",

Initial impression, is that the upstairs seating hadn't been cleaned in a while and the place was a bit of a mess.  As far as the food, I found the chicken to be overcooked and the fries to be undercooked. On the plus side, the flavor combo of the sandwich with the coleslaw was good as was the portion size. I was expecting a juicy piece.of chicken but even with the hot sauce it was a bit dry (only saved by the coleslaw). I literally couldn't touch the fries they were so soggy.  The mild is plenty hot, and my wife could barely finish her hot tenders which is saying something.  I'd definitely give this place another try, but wasn't the best first impression.",

We went around noon and it was pretty packed but we managed to find a seat and the wait for our food wasn't that bad. Note: they don't accept cash.   I have to say I was a little disappointed by my sandwich. I got the medium spice level and it was waaaaaaay too salty. I think it was the breading because once I got about half way through my sandwich, it was a little better but still way too salty. My boyfriend said that his was also salty but not nearly as salty as mine. I felt a little bleh after we went home because of it. I probably just got a bad batch.   However their fries are delicious and I loved their fry dust. There was a touch of sweetness in it and it was perfect. I loved the slaw and pickles on top of their sandwiches. Prices aren't too bad for the amount of food that you get. I think I'd come back again but try something else on their menu; I took a peek at the other customers around us and everything looked delicious! I love the idea of having a quality fried chicken in Oakland; I would've eaten it up while I was in undergrad.",

The chicken is made really fresh and very juicy but crispy at the same time. I would recommend the tenders or the sandwich. They add a tangy sauce with pickled veggies in the sandwich that really balance out the flavor. I would say the medium is a good spicy level for those that love spicy but dont want to go too overboard. But I did hear that the spicy is really good too! I would say the only disappointment was the fries. They werent flavored well and kind of stale. Hopefully it was just a bad batch... anyways I will be back and would say its a good local place for some delicious fried chicken. And that sweet tea reminds me of the south FOR SURE!!   Recommend!",

Some of the options include tenders, a sandwich, salad, or chicken and waffles. I opted for the chicken tenders with a side of fries and a drink. I went with the mild seasoning but there's multiple heat levels to tantalize all taste buds. In my opinion, the seasoning was pretty salty; but I don't typically over-season my food. The crinkle cut fries were just what I needed, though!   CHiKN also has what appears to be a full bar, which was unexpected.   After ordering, we were given a buzzer for our order. Whenever you choose your table, you dock the buzzer in the center, and it allows the food runner to locate you. Super cool!",

It's interesting how they establish their meal structure as well seeing as though they are almost 3 separate items if you want a drink, food and side. The only dipping sauce they have is their house sauce which is a weird spicy mayo??? Definitely could've had some ranch or bbq in my opinion. Loud atmosphere which I love and their table placers are very interesting and effective. Hopefully this place will grow and stay in Oakland, hopefully expanding upon refills and sauces choices in the near future.",

The issue is that the seasoning is so heavy you can almost \"feel\" it. I don't mean taste it, I mean feel it.....as in gritty. This chicken is seemingly  well prepared but completely ruined by being doused, like with a fire hose, with gritty seasoning. If they would back off they would have a hit.

You've got 5 options for heat level - I got the Mild and I could have easily gone Medium, I think. My order of Chicken and Waffles was really good - the waffles were a little crispy on the edges and soft on the inside, and two crispy delicious tenders.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to my first visit to ChiKN. I had just read the recent New Yorker article on Nashville Hot Chicken and I had been a customer of Bird on Run since just after it opened. I will probably be back but I have to say that I like Bird on the Run a lot better. Never having been to Princes' in Nashville, I have no idea which of ChiKN or Bird on the Run is the most authentic. It probably doesn't matter. If I am in Oakland and want hot chicken it will be ChiKN. If I am not it will probably be Bird on the Run.  The chicken sandwich was good. I ordered it medium and would not want to go any higher. It was pleasantly hot, with a bit of after burn. The chicken itself was moist and tasty. The crunchy outside was perhaps a bit salty...but who could say under all of that \"heat\". I did not care for the cole slaw.",

    "text": "I had their damn hot chicken sandwich and finally a place that serves heat that rivals what you may get at Bolton's in Nashville. The other rival hot chicken places in Pittsburgh make great sandwiches but they don't make it as hot.  Bird On The Run is good but there heat levels are weak. Thank you for not shying away about making something insanely hot that most people would not be able to eat. I was skeptical at first being on a college campus but this place is legit. Will eat again.",

    "text": "This place is awesome! Really cool vibe-casual seating, laid-back place to grab some good food. The service was extremely quick and efficient. Everyone was really friendly. The food was awesome. I got the chicken and waffles-the chicken was really good. It reminds me of chick-fil-a chicken with the southern fried style of cooking. I got them with the mild sauce-i like spicy so I might try medium next time. The waffles were very airy and delicious with a ton of maple syrup (if you aren't a fan of maple syrup, ask for it on the side). I was sad to see Qdoba go last year and wasn't sure if anything could replace it but I'm glad CHiKN has come around. Can't wait to come back!",

If you're feeling down, enjoy some juicy chicken. They have different flavors and when you tell them how hot you want it,  they'll always tell you to go down one sauce. It's True because my friends tried the hottest option and their mouths were burning lol. Be careful with the hotness choice. Anyways try it out and enjoy!",

    "text": "This is my second update to my original review. It appears they have taken constructive criticism to heart. I've been back to the location three or four times since my last update. All I can say is that the quality has continually improved. The french fries are even better than ever, a little less sweet and lighter on the seasoning so that the balance is better. The chicken remains excellent in its cooking. Where they have improved the most is their seasoning mixtures and technique. It looks like they Found the right mixture of dry and oil and seasoning. I have been able to get the plane, mild, and moderate mixes and enjoy them all, I think because the salt levels have come down so much and you can enjoy the overall experience better. I'm very happy to report all this, so I would encourage anyone that had some early misadventures here regarding the salt or seasonings to try it again.  They have really stepped up their game.",

    "text": "I have been going to chikn for the past several weeks now and the food is wonderful. The hot chicken sandwich is amazing and the special coleslaw and sauce make it even better. I like the simplicity of the menu. This place blows chick fil a out of the water food wise. The reason for the low rating is the service.  The last time I went a few days ago I ordered 3 combo chicken sandwich and fry meals to go of course once I got a cashiers attention they are usually on their phones with their backs to the register. Anyway, they kindly bagged my boxes up and sent me on my way. I get home and they completely forgot 3 orders of fries. I tried calling and the phone number listed is just a recorded message and you can't talk to anyone. Then they said to contact them via email which I did and got no response. Going to Oakland is never a convenient experience for people who don't live there. The parking is always a huge hassle and expensive. I'm usually willing to suck it up and go here anyway but after this experience I don't know if I will do that anymore.  *update the owner got in touch with me and refunded my money for the order. I highly recommend chikn. Despite my hiccup, they corrected their error and I will be sure to go back.",

I should've ordered three instead of five. EVERYTHING has seasoning on it, even the fries and mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious and a welcome respite from the saltiness of the chicken, even with the seasoning. Also this place clearly caters to college students, because the hip hop music was extra loud and definitely not family friendly.",
