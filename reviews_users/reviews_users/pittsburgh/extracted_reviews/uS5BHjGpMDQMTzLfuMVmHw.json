Being a ramen enthusiast I think the quality and authenticity of their ramen is decent and comparable to Ramen Bar at Squirrel Hill. Char Shu slices are flavorful but could have been thicker cut. Yakitori was Ok with tasty sauce, although I personally would prefer it a bit more charred. Overall a nice ramen place that's closer to home. Will likely drop by again.",

In addition to the typical tonkotsu you'll find at most good ramen places in the US, they also have a seafood ramen in a light broth with clams and shrimp that is pretty fantastic.  The noodles are chewy and the broth is fragrant, though could maybe use a bit more tare.  All in all, a big step up from the previous place... Which used udon noodles for their ramen.",

Think about getting dessert somewhere else on Walnut cuz the portion sizes are small. $12 buys a tall bowl of with ramen filling the bottom quarter. This optical illusion trick doesn't full my brain.  They cut their pork with a meat slicer because there is no way they can cut meat this thin by hand. I don't go to eat ramen because I am on a diet. I thought the broth was little salty but my friend thought it was ok. Anyways not going there again. There are lots of other ramen joints who don't skimp on portions when demanding a high price for soup noodles. I'll think about going there again when I feel the urge to feel dissatisfied.",

Place had an intimate, Jap dive place vibe to it that, funny enough, wasn't off putting during the day when we walked in for lunch. The girl who waited on us was warm and friendly. We got the pork buns as our appetizer. It was tasty, and the pork belly tender, but still doesn't come close to the amazing pork buns of Noodlehead (my benchmark for Pittsburgh until I find somewhere better). Since one of the sauces was on the spicy side, I gave my share to my companion which she happily devoured. I got the beef rice bowl which was perfectly seasoned. The thin shavings of meat made a perfect accompaniment to the bowl of seasoned rice. My lunch mate ordered a bowl of spicy ramen and she happily slurped through every bite. I can't give that a proper review though as I didn't even hazard a bite. Overall, we had a good and efficient lunch experience. Would love to go back and try their grilled items next time. Maybe the sake offerings, too!",

Had the spicy miso and it was spicy, not Pittsburgh spicy, but real spicy. It had a half of an egg, but a perfect egg with a good gelatinous yolk. The pork belly and chicken skin yakitori were very good, although I would have preferred the chicken skin a bit crisper. All in all a great improvement compared to the prior restaurant.",

Gyoza were very flavorful, came with a nice crisp, not greasy. Edamame service nice and hot, cooked perfectly, not too crunchy or mushy. Donburi chicken bowl had nice big pieces of chicken. Chicken ramen was flavorful, light, not too salty. Noodles were cooked nicely. Good luck and best wishes for continued successes!",

When I asked the server before I ordered, he said \"white fish.\" As I'm sure you know, that's not a specific fish but rather a classification of a ton of different fish. We I pressed, I was assured it was a garnish & \"you won't even taste it.\" Boy was that wrong. My chicken ramen was the fishiest chicken I've ever had. BUT the mochi and sake were amazing & once I accepted my chicken ramen as fish ramen, it was a good meal. The atmosphere is quiet & not too overcrowded. Two stars lost for being mislead by the wait staff & because I never want to taste a fish cake again.",

This one is in walking distance of our home in Bloomfield. We did the restaurant week special, which was $20.18 per person. The appetizers were the pork and chive dumplings, and my husband had the pan cake topped with pork belly. Oh my God so good!!! For our entrees, we both opted for rice bowls which were very very good. My husband had the vanilla tempura ice cream, and I had the green tea mochi.  Our waitress was very attentive, and kept checking on us frequently to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Our water glasses were kept refilled as asked and the checkout process was a breeze. While restaurant week was an excuse to come here we will definitely be back some other time because we really really enjoyed it. Definite gem in the neighborhood with this place",

The takoyaki is SO good. The outside is perfectly crunchy and the inside is ridiculously juicy. Extra bonus for not burning my tongue when I bit into it!   The tonkotsu ramen had a thin broth, and while it was still flavorful, I wish it was a little bit richer, like the tonkotsu back in California that I'm used to. The miso ramen, on the other hand, really hit the spot! The broth was just the right amount of thickness. Noodles were standard, meat was good but I wish they gave more. The egg had a weird taste to it, almost wine-like, but I'm not a huge egg fan anyway so it wasn't too big of a deal for me. However, I would still say that the ramen here is better than most other places in Pittsburgh.   Another thing to note, if you're someone who gets hot very easily like me, is that there did not seem to be much AC in the restaurant, and I was sweating profusely after finishing my ramen.  Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit!",

As a part of the deal, I got an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  My appetizer was chicken karaage with egg sauce. Not a fan of the sauce, and the chicken karaage was pretty standard. The ramen was good. I got tonkotsu ramen or something. Don't remember. I'd eat the ramen here again.  Anyway, the reason why I gave this restaurant 5 stars is solely because of my dessert - vanilla ice cream.... TEMPURA. I LOVE tempura. I exclusively eat shrimp tempura in my sushi. I have a box of shrimp tempura in my freezer from Costco that takes up the most room ever but it's worth it to have shrimp tempura on demand for homemade sushi/ramen/rice bowl/whatever. 100% of the reason why I picked this place to come to for restaurant week is because I saw they had ice cream tempura as a dessert. It lived up to my high expectations and was the highlight of my week. I can't really explain more other than it's a scoop of ice cream fried in tempura, which should speak for itself.",

I got the Spicy Miso and would not recommend it to anyone. It had no flavor, wasn't spicy, no seaweed, and the pork was nonfatty/thin. It was like a healthy version of ramen. The pork buns were decent but also a disappointment as there was minimal fat and they were quite thin cuts. Just flavor missing in general and probably cause they used thin slices of nonfatty pork.  I would not recommend this spot to anyone who likes ramen.",

Had a tasty iced oolong tea while I waited for my beef ramen and yakitori, which came out first. The chicken and green onion was tasty, as was the chicken skin, and both were cooked well, but I prefer them with a little crispy char, which they lacked. The beef ramen, on the other hand, was all I could ask for. A complex savory beef broth, loaded with beef, Asian spinach, an egg and fantastically chewy curly noodles. A large wooden spoon was provided, which was the only thing preventing me from just putting the large bowl to my lips! The wait staff was friendly and, overall, a great Sunday brunch!",

The edamame app is huge - more than two of us could eat!  Their space is small, but we were able to be seated right away on a weeknight.   We sat back by the kitchen and weirdly kept smelling cigarette smoke. Not sure where that was coming from, but otherwise had a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "The beautiful municipality of Shadyside, which is subsequently just East of Downtown in Pittsburgh, is home to a very quaint and refined little restaurant named Fujiya Ramen. You will spot this little gem on the East side of the block as the Red and Black Exterior makes it visually eye-popping which is accentuated with very colorful acouttrements native to Japan.   Upon entering the outer door is a very colorful foray full of pictures as a mural of different satisfied diners enjoying different menu items. When entering the second door and into the establishment I was immediately greeted by my server for this evening named, Hikiro whom was extremely attentive, very friendly and wore a smile as if it were more important than his apron which was clean and pressed.  I did notice it was only him working the floor up to this point and was stretched a little thin. However, the manager was aware and hurried about to help him along to smooth the transitions between customers whom were both in tables as well as sitting around the bar.  In the restaurant's defense, there was a rather large Vintage Car Show just 35 feet away from the which added to their foot traffic considerably.  The rich mahogany of the tables were perfectly set at each one.  The chopsticks laid in perfectly angled rows along the line of empty seats just waiting for hungry diners to show up this evening and use them voraciously!  The stemware polished.  The menu's placed.  They were ready for Dinner Rush.  Now when I talked with Hikiro, he suggested I try their Spicy MisoRamen as this is what they are known for and what their Chef's specialty is.  SOLD! Now ladies and gentlemen, I have eaten easily 200 bowls of Ramen from different establishments in my life.  I have worked with Shezuan Chefs... I have been yelled by those same Chefs to work harder and to be faster and to be more precise.  I have rubbed elbows with some spectacularly trained individuals in many different Chinese, Shezuan and Ramen Houses and I have attempted my own versions of Ramen. All of this being said...  Fujiya Ramen, I say this to you:  You NAILED It!!!  From the first, delicate, delectable bite of the perfectly braised Pork Belly Chashu combined with crisp and fresh Spring Onions sliced in a perfectly julienned 30 angled cuts, Spinach Bean Sprouts and Freshly Roasted kernels of Corn all brought together in this Deep, Rich and Spicy Miso Broth that was atop a bountiful mound of Ramen Noodles.  The entire meal had a depth of flavor as best as I have ever had. I sat and enjoyed my steaming bowl of ramen upon its arrival with its, perfectly cooked and poached half of an egg, which when asked, found out that the egg was cooked in a simmering broth of Sake as well as Soy Sauce, Ginger and other aromatics to make the egg taste unbelievable. This is a True testament to the experience and knowledge of the chef that is working in the kitchen.  Upon further probing into the details of the restaurant, we find out the Chef had been there for a number of years.  It comes across in each and every wonderful bite Chef;  KEEP IT UP!!! The only suggestion I have for this restaurant is for them to work on their actual Ramen Noodles.  I feel as if they were somewhat lacking.   Regardless of this normal noodle issue amongst Ramen establishments, their food, their flavor, their service, their ambiance, their location, their staff.... ALL Spectacular!   As I sat there enjoying myself immensley and continued to slurp away at this monster bowl of ramen (which subsequently was only $13), the restaurant began to fill with hungry patrons as well as tourists (because of the Vintage Car Show) stopping in to see if there is a bathroom they could use AND their regular patrons that came in, sat down at their spot at their bar and ordered their favorite drinks.  Oh right, the bathrooms were located downstairs, but ya'll, they took care of that aspect of the restaurant as well.    Well Done Indeed.  All in all, this experience was a very delicious one and extremely comfortable one with regards to ambiance and service.  I would highly suggest you stop by for a bowl of their Spicy Miso Ramen as soon as you get a chance. I would have to give this a 4.5 pig snout review, as all I wanted to do was snort and slurp up the delicious broth until there was no more!  Oink.  Oink.  Oink.  Oink.  Oi. .5",

    "text": "Came here to try out the menu items during restaurant week with my boyfriend. It didn't seem too busy when we arrived, but there were definitely several other groups and a large party when we arrived. Our waitress seated us and took our drink orders quickly - they had an interesting looking drink menu so we tried some of the whiskeys.   We selected our appetizers, entrees, and dessert from their restaurant week and placed our order. After a bit of a wait (about 45 minutes), my appetizer (assorted grilled skewers) arrived. The skewers included pork belly, chicken, chicken skin, quail eggs, and bacon wrapped asparagus. The skewers were well prepared and tasty, with the pork belly being my personal favorite. At this point, we were getting a bit antsy waiting for our food, so we asked the waitress when to expect our food. She seemed surprised that we hadn't received the order yet and went to check, after which another employee came out to assure us that my boyfriend's appetizer (karaage) would be our shortly.  Unfortunately, it was nearly another half hour before we received our ramen, but no karaage yet. The ramen was good, with chewy noodles, rich broth (although a little oily), and good toppings, although both of us agreed it wasn't notably better than other ramen spots we've tried around Pittsburgh. Another 10-15 minutes later, the karaage arrived. My boyfriend decided to just finish the karaage and pack the ramen to go. At this point we had been at the restaurant a bit longer than expected (about two hours) but still had dessert on the way.   We had picked the mochi ice cream and ice cream tempura, both of which arrived relatively quickly once we got our ramen packed up. The desserts were great - a generous serving size and great flavors like mango and green tea. We'd definitely try the tempura ice cream again when we get the chance.  Unfortunately the wait time outweighed the quality of the food and service for us. Although some of the wait could definitely be attributed to perhaps being understaffed (the restaurant didn't seem crazy busy or anything, maybe 75% full, but maybe still more traffic than a usual weekday evening?) or just a fluke, but for the quality and price, we have other options for ramen and Japanese food in the city that we will likely choose ahead of this one in the future.",

I ordered the chicken ramen ($12) with chicken chashu, spinach, egg, bamboo shoots, and scallions. A fish cake was supposed to come with it but I opted out of that (not a fish fan). The ramen was outstanding- super comforting, super flavorful, the noodles were perfectly cooked.. it was outstanding. My friend loved her ramen as well. It was PLENTY of food for lunch- honestly it could easily have been two portions. I was a crazy person and gobbled the whole thing up though. At the end of the meal, we both had the opportunity to spin a prize wheel- I won a free t-shirt that read, \"My favorite type of men is Ra-men\" and my friend got a gift card! How awesome is that?! This place rocks. I follow them on Instagram now and plan on coming back for lunch ASAP.",

    "text": "I'm Japanese and tonkotsu is my favorite ramen flavor, so I had to try this place out! The tonkotsu ramen here is pretty average, but that's exciting in Pittsburgh where I've had noodles in Chinese flavored soup dressed up as \"ramen\". Extra star for being the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh.  TLDR: The ramen here is probably enjoyable to many people, and it actually tastes like ramen! :O   Details: The soup was flavorful and easy to drink. Pretty standard, although I felt like they could have done a little more. I personally really like thick, kotteri tonkotsu soup so it was a little lacking in depth and richness. Noodles were pretty normal. The chashu was fine, although there was still some of that distinct meat smell that didn't need to be there. Also I would have preferred a little more fat in those slices. There's half of an ajitama (flavored soft boiled egg) in the bowl. I feel like ajitama just needs simple flavoring, but the one I had an extraneous flavor/scent to it. Not sure if I just had a weird off one, but it had kind of like a sweet alcohol scent to it. I've had good ajitama before that were a little sweet, but this one definitely threw me off. Finally, the bowls here are too tall and deep. It's difficult to finish the bowl off at the end.   At the end of the day, this place will satisfy your authentic ramen cravings.",

While the ramen wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't anything to seek out or write home about. I ordered the spicy miso ramen, and while the broth was delicious, I found the noodles themselves to be less delicious and pretty bland compared to other nearby ramen spots. I ordered takeout, and, though the order was ready quickly and the staff there were friendly and efficient, the noodles were really stuck together and tough to get apart. Maybe I'll try again, and if I do I'll probably dine in to see if that's a little better of an experience.",

The noodles are good, with enough body that the broth sticks to them. The meat is well cooked and tender.    I ordered a tonkatsu ramen (my go-to whenever I try a new ramen place), and found that the broth was tasty, but a little weaker than I am used to. The broth doesn't have the same complexity or depth that I'm used to, but it was okay for the dish. Their miso ramen broth looks to have more body, and I might recommend trying that instead.   The only thing that is a little goofy is that they give you a wooden ladle in place of a soup spoon, which makes it a little awkward  to drink the soup. (My friends didn't finish their broth, for example.)   If you're around and looking for ramen, this is pretty good! The seating is a bit tight (they have a row of tables in the back, and then some near the front), so call ahead if you're bringing a bigger group.",

    "text": "Wow. Sometimes, you happen to visit a place that you thought would be good, but it just blows you away.  This was the case for us last week, when we visited this incredible place. Yep, I'm just like you - I love my favorite places, and it's hard to get me to try new places once I have built my collection of perfect spots. This is what makes it hard to be a Yelp Elite reviewer sometimes, but I really try to power though!  The story behind this establishment is compelling enough - a father and son business, straight from Tokyo and the surrounding prefectures. The senior chef (father) has reportedly been in the izakaya / ramen business for 40 years, and has his son as his partner.  We arrived with kids in tow, and believe me, we all LOVED it! As is our usual ritual, we ordered a ton of appetizers, and then added a few orders of ramen to complete the meal. Takoyaki were first, and while delicious, they did not have much octopus within - no real gripes, as we realize this is a pricy dish that can sometimes over-reach. We have our favorite place in town for this particular item, and were actually relieved that the family favorite remains Champion.  Gyoza were flavorful and awesome. My only suggestion would be that they are served with the spicy shoyu that is currently used, and then also have non-spicy shoyu on the table if guests don't want the heat. (We have a 4 year old and an 8 year old who don't like spicy - I'll never understand!)  Kara-age with egg sauce is tasty. Loved the sauce, and it is worth the uncharge from the standard dish. Seasoning is better for this dish than in other places in town. Would like a shade more umami - perhaps in the batter or in the egg sauce to round out the tasty bites, but this is minor, and we loved it.  Yakitori is absolutely AMAZING here. I am an absolute disciple of yakitori, and have tried (unsuccessfully) to replicate this at home - it's much harder than it looks! I can say that this place has the best version of izakaya yakitori that I have had locally, and it is extremely faithful to the experience I had in Japan - except, they need to have the whole \"namachu\" experience with Japanese low-alcohol sessional draft beers to round out the experience. It is clear from the first bite that they use high quality oak natural charcoal, and I would bet it's real \"binchotan,\" sourced from high grade, ancient Japanese oak trees selected for this honor (but I didn't have time to chat with the Chef). Nothing is dried out, all the meat is succulent and deliciously smoky, and the tare is sublime, with lots and lots of umami. I came here wanting high quality ramen, and left not only having just that, but an amazing yakitori experience. Do NOT miss the yakitori here!!!  OK, by now, if you have actually kept reading on, you will probably anticipate my discussion on the ramen. I am by NO means an expert on ramen. Actually, I never had this while in Japan, and my entire \"expertise\" comes from instant ramen packets, hardly the place where high brow foodies admit to lurk. That being said, I will say this - the entire ramen experience was outstanding, save for ONE thing - my wife and kids are relatively short, and it was very difficult for them to enjoy the food because the tables are slightly high and the bowls the ramen are served in are tall and narrow! Who would have thought this would be a difficult thing, but alas, it was!  Enough nit-picking. You see my 5 stars, so you know where this is headed, and the chefs deserve the rating. My \"tonkotsu\" ramen was fabulous. The broth was rich and porky - just like you'd expect from a pork belly broth. Does it need to be so rich and fatty? Not sure, but it was velvety and smooth going down, and was a HUGE step up from my experience with instant ramen dishes.  Their noodles were superb - I imagine they are the fabled \"alkaline noodles\" that famous establishments like Momofuku and others all worship - the noodles here were tasty, springy, and highly enjoyable. I will say that aside from all the delicious flavors I enjoyed from the broth and ingredients, the noodles held my interest as a separate component, and were the center of the dish.  I know, I know - this is getting to be a really long review. Yep, I have that tendency. I just want to share my experience, though. The assembly of the dish was great, and I appreciated the soft boiled egg, wakame, and other add-ins. Presentation was beautiful, and I really loved it. I am by no means the ramen guru, especially not having a reference from my Japanese experience, but this was delicious, nutritious, and to my palate, authentic.  We will be here again, and again, and again.... Totemo oishii desu!!!",

There was barely a change in decor since the replacement. Because Fujiya Ramen is a chain, I had a higher expectation for it. Tan Izakaya's ramen was very good, just a bit on the pricer side. Fujiya Ramen is a bit cheaper. It was good, but definitely not good as some other places I've had in Pittsburgh including it's predecessor. The menu is very short, only a few appetizers and ramens listed.   Miso Ramen: Included pork belly chashu, spinach, corn, bean sprout, and egg. The runny egg was PERFECT  There wasn't that much stuff in the ramen, only a few pieces here and there. The noodle was cooked well, but it was a bit chewy. The broth was good; not too salty, but a bit thick for my liking.  VERDICT:  Would I order the ramen again? Maybe  Would I go back again? Probably so I can try the do",

Maybe a bit on the salty side, but nothing too crazy. Springy noodles, chashu pork was cooked well, portion was plentiful and absolutely hit the spot on a rainy Monday evening. Price point is similar to other ramen shops around town ($12-13/bowl).   overall would recommend - it passed enough of a test that I'm planning to take my boyfriend (diehard ramen lover) back to give it a try sometime!",

Not sure if they make it in house, but they do it right- a bit chewy, elastic, and delicious. I had the spicy miso broth- it is pretty great. Unlike some other hipster ramen places, Fujiya is down to earth, no frills, no bright red lighting in a dark room.

Each one was made with own flavor, texture and taste. They were great!! The main courses I couldn't say the same, honestly it was not good. I am willing to give this place another try but would definitely agree it is not the best place for some japanese ramen.

I went traditional and got the tonkatsu ramen at $12. It arrived relatively quickly and I could smell the nice garlic flavor. The broth is what makes it. The noodles are cooked well and have absorbed the broth flavor. There was a good amount of mushrooms and nori, which I really appreciate as sometimes it's too much everything else. The pork belly was overly fatty, more like bacon fat. The half soft boiled egg was a bit too sweet for my taste.  The place was surprisingly busy on a Saturday. I got there just in time. A large party came in after me and then another pair that took up the back dining space. The subsequent groups found themselves at the bar or up front with me. This made service slow, particularly because they were training someone, actually showing him how to make drinks and such. I don't think they had anticipated such a crowd on a Saturday.  The staff is friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The draft list is surprising. For example, the Samuel Adams seasonal is Summertime. It's January....",

We started with the pork buns and they had a delicious sweet sauce. The ramen was excellent and the bowls seemed pretty full. We both enjoyed it and will be back again.",

I got the negi ramen  which was marked as new on the menu. It was more on the spicy side, and the broth tasted almost like kimchi. My company got the miso ramen, which he liked. We shared the pork buns and they had good flavors. Perhaps I just had high expectations coming in because they looked authentic, but I just wasn't impressed with the food.",

    "text": "Fujiya Ramen, located in Shadyside, really hits the spot when you're craving warm broth on a rainy day (which isn't uncommon in Pittsburgh). We came at a time when they had this promotion where if you posted Fujiya on Instagram and tagged them, you got to spin a wheel that offered various items including a free drink, an appetizer, all the way up to a free ramen! It was really fun and the waitress was so sweet and friendly through it all. Her hospitality was definitely my favorite part of eating here.  My friend ordered the miso ramen and I got the oyakodon - a bowl of rice with chicken, onion, and runny egg, topped with ginger and scallions. We also got takoyaki as an appetizer to share. Everything tasted very good and I think the portions were filling enough for one meal (although I wouldn't go as far to say they were generous portions).   The reason I would give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service could be slow depending on how packed the place is. And the place can pack up very quickly since there is limited seating. Additionally, the food can be seen as somewhat pricey for how much food you get (the entrees ranged from $12-15 and the takoyaki was $5 for 5 pieces).   If I'm ever craving Japanese food when I'm in the area, I'd definitely come here. But I don't think I'd go out of my way just to eat here if I'm not already in Shadyside.",

    "text": "Highly recomme their ramen! The broth is rich and well prepared, I can taste how much hour they put in for this broth. I remember once read before that broth is the sole of ramen. I believe this is the best ramen I had in Pittsburgh. Definitely worth to try! The pork belly was very well cook, it just melt in my mouth.  I had the tokoyaki as appetizer and I don't think they are very good, minimum taste, I wouldn't order it again.  I didn't get any drinks but I do see they have a big selection of Japanese wine. Maybe I will try some of that next time",

    "text": "I love ramen but sadly, this place was not up to par with my taste buds but it wasn't a bad experience. If Yelp allowed this, I would rate this place a 3.5 instead of a 3.    * Food: I ordered the Kaisen Ramen and shared a plate of the Pork and Chive Gyoza. The ramen was good but there wasn't anything special about it. The clams and egg were pretty good though. What gave this place an extra 0.5 stars (besides the nice restaurant vibe) was the gyoza that we ordered. Our server had recommended it and I'm glad we ordered it. The meat was juicy and it wasn't too oily.       * Cost vs Worth: The Kaisen Ramen was $14 and the Gyoza was $5 (5 pieces). The ramen is a bit more pricey compared to other places such as Ramen Bar and Zen's Noodle House. On top of it's mediocre taste, I wouldn't say it is worth the price. But, the Gyoza was definitely worth it!  Will I come here again? - Sadly, no.",

And yes, it's a ramen house, and they do that well too.  Don't even get me going on their pork bao buns unless you want to just hear me make deep happy noises and roll my eyes back ad nauseum, because that's how much I like them.  I'm ridiculous about the food here--they can do no wrong in my book. The service has been prompt and friendly on all my visits too. So, other than the madness that is finding parking in Shadyside, this is an all around win as far as I'm concerned.",

    "text": "We got to Fujiya Ramen in a round-a-bout way today. We started out for Pitaland in Brookline, but a severe thunderstorm came through and the place got packed!  So we thought about going down the street when we learned of the train derailment at station square. We decided to drive over there and check it out, and then go to Zen's Noodles. Well they're still doing their renovation and that's how we wound up here.  I'm glad we came here because we enjoyed the ramen and the gyoza appetizer, as well as the decor of the place and the neighborhood.  We've been to a few ramen places in the Pittsburgh area, and in comparison Fujiya is probably right in the middle for the ramen and slightly higher for location. I thought the gyoza was excellent. I really liked the broth but found the pork to on the bland side. My companion ordered extra noodles and at the time I wished I had done the same. However, after completing my meal I am glad I didn't. The portion was just right for me.  I like the decor although it seems to be more of bar (alcohol) than a ramen bar.  We sat at a high table near the front window. So often, the tall chairs become uncomfortable because of how my legs press down on the edge of the seat but not with these. I guess the rungs below where you rest your feet are a little better placed - at least for me.   In the bathroom there is a bottle of mouthwash and small plastic cups on the sink counter. I kind of thought that was odd!  Parking here can be difficult. We found a public lot a couple blocks away and it was Sunday so free parking.    All in all we enjoyed our experience here at Fujiya Ramen.",
