    "text": "This place was delightful. I will be returning and I'll update my review appropriately.  I went here for some take out dinner and got some Pad See Yew with Tofu.  It was great and the dark soy sauce was near perfect. I asked for it to be very spicy, but it sort of fell flat, and I'll blame it on my blinding midwestern whiteness. So, if you want Thai-Spicy, make sure to specify that emphatically.   The place does seem small, so take out if probably preferred. It is ridiculously low priced for the quality of food you get, so jump on this place before it becomes inundated with every hipster in Pittsburgh.   I think some Penang Tofu will really test their mettle.  ***UPDATE**** I tried the penang tofu. It was miserable. The curry was watery, the tofu tasted barely-fried, and the veggies became limp and waterlogged in the spicy mix. The upside here is that after I requested at \"15 out of 10\" they delivered a spice level that didn't disappoint, unlike the rest of Pittsburgh.   Rating dropped to 3-stars, from 4. Head for their noodles folks.",

    "text": "I have to admit I wasn't wowed by Smiling Banana Leaf during my first visit. I tried the pad thai - boring, I know but I had read so many yelp reviews saying it was the best pad thai in Pittsburgh - and was unimpressed (actually I thought it was kind of dry and lacked that awesome, rich peanuty flavor). I didn't really plan on going back until I was looking for an open restaurant on a Monday night and was in the area but I'm so glad I did. While Smiling Banana Leaf isn't my favorite as far as noodle dishes (Thai Cuisine and it's Spicy Basil Noodles wins there), it is by far and away my favorite for curry in the city. The pumpkin curry, in particular, is truly phenomenal. I love that they don't scrimp on the veggies/meat (no big bowl of sauce here), that the veggies are varied/interesting, that they have really great brown rice for accompaniment, and that the spice level here is actually legit. Granted, when I order a higher spice level the server often second-guesses me, but once I verify that I do indeed want my curry hot, they deliver (something that's been lacking at other Thai restaurants). Also, the spices they use in their curry seem more flavorful rather than just delivering tongue-burning heat.",

I know that sugar is used in Thai sauces but everything was too sweet. We  also ordered the seafood salad and a green curry with chicken. Salad was ok, but much of the seafood was tasteless. The curry was the most successful dish, but chicken was tough. We got everything 5 out of 10 for spice level.  Maybe we should have gone higher in the spice scale.

    "text": "Excellent Thai food!  Well worth the search in Highland Park to find it!  We went last night with friends who are vegetarian and so we had a variety of dishes at our table.  We started with the fried spring rolls - a little garlicky but other than that, fresh and tasty and crisp!  I ordered the Pad See Ew with shrimp.  The shrimp were small but they were plentiful.  The sauce was a little different - it was a soy based that almost tasted sweet and sour - it was quite tasty.  We weren't sure what \"temp\" to order things not having been there before  - I ordered a 5 but would probably move up to a 6 next time as they are on par with the usual Thai restaurant we go to.  It was the best kind of heat - you could taste it but it didn't build or last long, so you could taste all the flavors coming through.  My preference is always heat but not overpowering heat.  DH ordered his favorite green curry and gave it two thumbs up - while I didn't taste it, the smell was just heavenly (it was so good, he wasn't offering to share :(.  The other couple ordered the Choo Curry Tofu which was a basic red curry with tofu and the Tofu eggplant with basil which was loaded with both tofu and what looked like the smaller Asian eggplant.  The restaurant is quite tiny - perhaps they can seat 20 there.  We arrived on a cold snowy Sunday evening at 630 without a reservation (we bad).  They suggested that we walk up the street to the coffee shop and they would call us as soon as a table was ready.  Definitely worth the trip - just call first!",

Ive been here on a Sunday afternoon when Bobby and I are the only ones in the tiny place and I also stopped by last Friday night for dinner with my dad and Bobby.  At 8pm, the place was stuffed full and a whiff of sweaty muggy people hit me in my face as I walked in the door.  Definitely should have made a reservation.  The host told me it would be about  a 30 minute wait but offered to take my name and phone number if anything opened up sooner.  I stepped outside to decide what we would do and saw 3 outside tables not in use!  With Pittsburgh weather the way that it is, it just so happened to be about 68 that night.  I asked if the host would seat us outside and he agreed.  Shortly after, the other two tables filled!  Lucky us!  At this point I have tried many of their dishes - chicken rad na, yellow curry, pumpkin curry, chicken pad thai and I have had zero complaints.  Bobby tried a noodle soup and it was uneventful.  Really love Smiling Banana Leaf :)",

I was so excited to find a great Thai restaurant in my new city. The Chicken Satay was also really good to have before the main dish! Smiling banana leaf is such a fun place to take your friends when you want to try something new! It's BYOB so don't forget to take your favorite Riesling and enjoy.",

We didn't make a Saturday reservation but since we were having an early dinner they sat us. We ordered the fresh rolls with chicken that were very tasty. We had the Tom Yom soup with chicken, the mango salad with chicken, and I had the best pineapple fried rice that I have had yet in the burg ( I don't care for onions so I ordered with out). It's BYOB and excellent",

The menu is pretty standard, they have all the dishes you would expect at a typical Thai place, and maybe a few one's you wouldn't. (Pumpkin curry anyone?) I won't give them too many points for being creative or original, but I will give them points for doing the favorite dishes we know and love very, very well. I will be ordering from them over and over.",

Part way through my meal I started feeling funky and asked if they use MSG.  They do.  It makes me feel off and of course I should have thought to ask when ordering but forgot to.  Why do places have to load their food with it?  The space is tiny.  And, some of the tables have wood benches to sit on that look particularly uncomfortable.  This does not seem like the kind of place where you want to linger with friends but more so a good take out option or a quicker lunch or dinner.    This place is not bad, but I will stick with Thai Cuisine where they don't use MSG and the food is great.",

My mouth felt like it was in heaven and in hell at the same time.  The food was really good so I wanted to keep eating it, so I painfully ate every delicious bite. It probably was just a mistake or I'm becoming more sensitized to spice, but either way - the food was amazing.   To start we had the samosas which had a bit of a twist on them! They had cucumber sauce and the dough was more similar to the wraps that spring rolls are made of.  It was interesting, but a little too sweet for my taste. I was looking for a more savory samosa. We had the pad thai and the panang curry which were good. However, the portions were pretty small and the prices were a bit high for how much food they were offering. The pad thai was not the best I've ever had but it sure beats a lot of other restaurants out there!  Another downside to this place is that it's so small! You almost always have to make a reservation, the only time I got in was on a random Thursday for lunch. The service was really quick which satisfied my impatient 5 year old self so again, remember to tip well!",

The poor rating is based on the terrible customer service my friends and I received for the 2nd time. My friends and I went here the day after Christmas for some quality Thai food and to let another one of our friends experience Thai food for the 1st time. Upon arrival, the restaurant was filled to capacity with only outside seating available. My friends and I decided to wait since we really had our hearts set on eating here. While waiting for about 10 minutes, the host told us we should be seated shortly since another table was becoming available. A couple minutes later, I noticed the server seated a family at the table that was supposed to be for my friends and I. So I politely said, \"excuse me, the host just told us we were going to be seated at the table.\" He snarled back with irritation in his voice that the host isn't the server and doesn't know what she is doing. He moved the family together so they can be seated at 1 table versus being separated, etc. He said a little bit more but I cannot remember exactly verbatim but nonetheless his tone and body language were uncalled for. All the host could say was she is sorry and she is not the server.   This is the 2nd time I have experience rude service from the same server. The first time I complained to manager and still he walks around with the same negative attitude and horrible customer service as before. Due to this 2nd encounter, we will not be coming back to Smiling Banana Leaf. Good food but horrible service. They will not get another dime from me or my friends!",

After reading so many positive reviews I had this place on my list to try and I'm glad I was able to make it there for lunch today. I had never been to the area before but it was quite easy to get to from Shadyside (where I live).   There is a small parking lot where you can park and when I went there was plenty of spaces left. The restaurant is small inside but is very well decorated - loved the ambiance.   I ordered the Tom Kha soup and the Spicy Noodles - OMG they were sooooo good. I thought the spicy noodles were the best that I've ever had. I love the classic spicy basil noodle dish that you see at most Thai restaurants but I've always had complaints about the ones I've tried in the past - they were either not spicy enough or the chicken was dry or there wasn't enough sauce. But at Smiles - it was perfection - there was tender pieces of chicken, it was spicy (as it should be) and sauce covered each noodle!   I highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back there again. It's such a gem of a place!",

Smiling Banana Leaf is a small Thai place, that, in my opinion, sets itself up perfectly for a good lunchtime experience. We got in later in the afternoon, but we were still alright for the lunch menu. I ordered the Panang Curry and my parents got the pineapple curry and some spring rolls for accompaniment. My curry, as I'd hoped, was creamy and abundant with coconut milk, and piping hot. The chicken in it was equally pleasing due to its moist, curry inundated state. It's definitely a dish that'll keep you going if you want a big lunch.  The food is good, but you'll want to avoid coming in large groups. They only have a handful of four-tops and one that seats six, so any larger may cause difficulties.   But if you're going to roll in one afternoon for lunch, go for it.",

I started with fresh spring rolls, like I do at every Southeast Asian restaurant. They were out of shrimp so I got tofu. They were okay, but not enough Thai basil, and I didn't like that they cut them into pieces for you. The dipping sauce was good though.  The pineapple curry had a great flavor but not spicy enough for me. My major complaint with it though was the meat was just not good. The pieces of beef were small and had a rubbery texture. I'm not expecting filet mignon in my curry, but this was pretty bad. Some of my friends' dishes that I sampled were better, particularly the noodle dishes. But my curry was not up to par, and since I order curry about half the time I eat Thai, this is a matter of importance.

Both times that I remembered I went  for lunch on a Saturday. There was no wait! So for those who do not want to waste time and eat good cheap thai food, this is the place!  I tried the Crispy Calamari and it was surprisingly good! Very different from large chain restaurants and has a home-y feeling to it. I wouldn't mind ordering it again! OH, and the thai ice coffee is yummy! It's on the sweet side, so if you don't like sweet coffee, don't order it.  From the same party, we had the chicken basil, chicken red curry, pineapple fried rice, curry fried rice, and pad thai. I'm a big fan of their red curry because of the coconut milk red paste.  The veggies that came with the curry were all delicious too. The pad thai was wonderful as well. The pineapple fried rice was a bit on the sweet side, but if you like it, it may be for you. The curry fried rice had its distinctive taste, but personally I prefer the red curry.  So if you don't want to wait and want cheap thai food, come to smiling banana leaf!",

We ordered the  dumplings the sauce to go with it was excellent we also tried the soup i didntthink i would like a coconut based soup but it was also great.  We ate the ginger dish and the panang curry both were excellent the sauces and flavors are both top notch.  We finished with the fried banana dessert which i recommend to anyone.  I love spicy food and ordered 8 stars the other dish was 3 stars both dishes had a lot of spice so if you are not a spicy food kinda person get 0 to 2 stars regardless though the Food gives this place 5 stars on top of the food the service was great.and the resturant while not fancy or very spacious was a great cozy place on a sunny afternoon.  I will eat here again whether it is dine in or take out. 5 stars  This place is a must try here in pittsburgh.",

The service is usually very good.  My one minor complaint about SBL is that the dining area is rather small.  However, they also do take-out, so if you live around the area, it would not be a problem to get your meal to go.  If you are coming with a large group of people, you might want to reconsider as they do not exactly have the adequate seating for this.",

It gets pretty packed in there, for the place isn't that big, so I encourage you to make a reservation.   Got there and ordered appetizers. I got the crispy taro spring rolls. I didn't really like this dish. There were unexpected potatoes making it heftier than normal spring rolls. I wasn't a fan.   For my entree, I got the pineapple fried rice which is very different than my normal pad Thai! It was such a good choice. The portion was enormous and I was able to take some home.   I enjoyed to service in the place. I just wish they would have cleared our table more promptly and especially without us having to ask. With everything, we barely had enough room for our plates and the wine.",

Everything on the menu looked so fresh and delicious. I ended up settling on the vegetable Thai noodle soup. This bowl was so large I barely made a dent in it and had a full meal the next day too. The broth was the most flavorful not too salty broth I have ever had. The vegetables were so fresh and delicious and the noodles were down right divine. My boyfriend even agreed that he was jealous of my order because it was so dang good. I also had a sip of the Thai iced coffee which was super sweet. It's not necessarily my drink of choice but it's very authentic.  I can't wait to stop by again and try their curry.",

Also, their spicy scale is a lot more forgiving. We ordered a 3 to be on the safe side, could have easily gone up another 2-3. Service was friendly and fast. Sat outside on a beautiful day. Will definitely be back! It also doesn't hurt that it's on such a cute street and parking was easy to find.",

The place is quite small and gets really crowded, I saw a few people turning back since the wait was so long and hence a reservation is highly recommended.  We ordered the crab rangoons as an appetizer, and Thai red curry and cashew stir fry for for the main portion. I would watch the spice level here definitely and order a level lower. I usually get a 7 in Thai restaurants, but my dish turned out more spicy than my liking. That being said the food was extremely delicious. The cashew stir fry was so flavorful and heavenly. The red curry was delicious too. The crab rangoons were good as well. Overall a pleasant and delicious dinner, and we will come back to explore other dishes on the menu.",

The menu was the standard Americanized Thai fare, but that didn't stop me from enjoying everything we ordered.  We ordered the CRISPY PORK SPRING ROLL, CHICKEN SATAY, and STEAMED DUMPLINGS for the table.  The spring rolls and dumplings both had tasty, meaty fillings, and all 3 dishes came with nicely paired dipping sauces.  The satay was my least favorite dish--the chicken was a bit dry and the satay spices weren't terribly flavorful.  But the rest of my table had no complaints.  I ordered the TOM YUM SOUP and THAI BASIL stir fry, to which I added broccoli, while my fiancee had the PAD SEE EW.  My soup was delightfully spicy and sour and chock-full of mushrooms, and my basil dish was flavorful and plenty spicy for me as well (I asked for 9/10), not always an easy feat for this chili junkie.  And the bites I stole off my fiancee's plate were a perfect complement to my own dish--the eggs, veggies, and noodles were saucy and slightly sweet.  Our friends inhaled their GREEN CURRY and MASSAMAN CURRY bowls.  The portions were all sizable--our combined entree leftovers were another for another single portion meal.  DIBS.",

The Highland Park location was easy to find, and there were even a few cute tables and chairs outside in front. I love al fresco dining, so I'll definitely be back when it's a bit warmer. We walked in and were greeted by the friendly hosts and immediately seated. I loved the vintage looking chairs and eclectic decor. The whole space had a really nice flow to it.   We soon ordered, and the food came quickly. I got pineapple fried rice (carb loading for a marathon!) and my roommate got the mango salad. Both options were delicious! Everything was hot and perfectly cooked. The spice levels (3 and 4 respectively) seemed accurate. I'd probably get a 6 or a 7 next time for the rice, but for someone who doesn't want spice 3 was perfect! I can't wait to come back and try some of the other options here. Noodlehead has been my go-to Thai place in Pittsburgh, but I wanted to find something other than street noodle Thai and Smiling Banana Leaf is perfect!",

We were given a wait quote of 10m, though one of the girls offered us an outside table soon after and said we could move inside if it started raining again, which was appreciated. It took a while, understandably, for us to be greeted/given water, but our server was sweet and very apologetic about it when she arrived.   My friend ordered the red curry with tofu, spice level 1 and I ordered the spicy tom yum noodle soup, spice level 1. Thank goodness neither of us ordered appetizers, because these were such generous portion sizes (coming from someone who eats a lot). The lemongrass broth was absolutely delicious and had the perfect amount of spice to it. So soothing to have after a long day at work. My only gripe was that the chicken was a bit dry. My friend greatly enjoyed her dish as well and ended up having to get half of it boxed up. Our server did check on us a couple times (my friend never went thirsty!) and overall provided wonderful service. I can easily see myself becoming a regular here and will be recommending this place to many others!",

The young man at the register handed me two menus and pointed to table implying I should seat myself. Then I waited over 10 minutes for water.  When it was finally delivered the waitress just put them on the table, never making eye contact. Throughout the night I was puzzled as to why the service was sooo bad. It wasn't particularly busy and it was only a table for two. The worst part about the night was the smell coming from the bathroom. I've never smelt anything so terrible. I requested to move to a table located closer to the front of the restaurant. They seemed more annoyed then anything.  The smell permeated the room and several tables were left holding their noses. Overall, it was a terrible night but according to our waitress she was \"living the dream\" so it should have been better lol. I won't give them another chance.",

With one exception, all the food I've had here has been good. Really good. That exception was the calamari appetizer. That was just downright awful. \"Crispy calamari\" turned out to be 8 (I counted) small calamari rings that were deep fried beyond recognition and were impossible to bite through. Like bad onion rings. Just terrible! And for $6.50 it has to be the one item on the menu you absolutely must never order! Talk about a bad taste in my mouth! I'm willing to overlook them and just take it as a lesson learned.  The spring rolls are a delight, the pork ginger was spectacular with spice level right on, and seafood entrees are very good as well. Lunch size portions are sizable and a really good value not to mention super tasty. I'd give the food a solid 4 star rating.  The atmosphere, however, is abysmal. I'd give it 1 star. People tell you its small. That's an understatement. Small, crowded, uncomfortable. And in the winter, the front door opening and closing brings the temp inside down 5-10 degrees each time. BRRRR.  The setting is like someone set up tables in your grandma's living room and said, oh wait, we can add one or two more in here, you don't mind do you? - now sit down and enjoy! Sorry, that's not my idea of an ideal dining experience. There is no way you'd EVER get me here at a conventional dinner/lunch time nor on any weekend! It's bad at off peak times! So small and so uncomfortable it ruins everything!   I consider Smiling Banana Leaf a take-out only place. The food is good and if I lived closer I'd have their number on speed dial. But don't invite me to dinner there. I won't go.",

I ordered three types of dishes for about 60 people, so I qualified for a discount. The cost ended up being ~$10/person, which obviously is outstanding for the quality. Also, the portions are huge and I ended up with lots of leftovers. (Just as good the next day!)   My only gripe was that the food arrived without serving utensils but accompanied by a handful of napkins and around 10 sets of chopsticks. I was able to make it work because the meeting the meal was catered for happened to be in the same building as my office. But, this isn't always the case, and it did send me into a little bit of a panic. I didn't ask for serving utensils because in my experience with catering, they are always provided. So, I'm not sure if I didn't receive them because I didn't ask, they were forgotten, or that isn't an option.   All in all, one of the better catering options in Pittsburgh. I will be ordering again!",

Last time we went, the rude server, who I'm sure all the other reviews are referring to, told us we have to rush because there is a group coming who has a reservation.  She treated us as if she was doing us a huge favor to even be in the restaurant.    Then she brought us out egg rolls, they were still frozen! gross.  We were going to just leave at that point, but, they rushed the rest of the food out really quickly upon us requesting the check.  Hopefully the management reads these reviews to see how many folks had a bad experience at the hands of the staff and that a change needs made.",

Eating in again would be another story. It's just so tight in here it's pretty uncomfortable. Their entire space is smaller than my family room & every time the door opened yesterday, I froze.   Now for the good part. Their food is really delicious! They have so many options on the menu and many are seafood dishes, which excites me. I had a hard time choosing but ultimately picked the prik poa talay with seafood, lots of veggies & a sweet chili paste. Yum! There are at least 7-8 other menu options I'd love to try.   Previously we'd tried multiple veggie appetizers and they were all very tasty. Yesterday we ordered the fried calamari & unfortunately it arrived overcooked. It was probably a 10 second mistake, so I won't be too harsh on that when everything else I've ordered here I clearly loved.   Service has been outstanding in both our visits here & they delivered a full 9 in spice to my husbands dish, which made him super happy. It's rare when this happens.  Prices here are super reasonable - my lunch entree was $10.   I'm anxious to eat their food again, but from now on its takeout.",

Sauce is thick and delicious. Spicy ratings are from 1-10. I like mild spice and got a 3, definitely on the higher side of a 3 but oh so delicious. We didn't take advantage of it, but it's BYOB.

    "text": "THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON OTHER REVIEWS FOR THIS PLACE START IN ALL CAPS!  It's because this place is de-freaking-licious!  If you read my other reviews on Thai places, you'll see I always get the Pad Thai as my point of comparison.  This place served me the best Pad Thai I've ever had!  My wife was pissed at me because I was too busy stuffing my face to talk to her.  The dish struck the perfect balance of deliciousness with the sweet Pad Thai sauce, scrumptious chicken, peanuts, and green onions.  The sauce was incredible.  Pad Thai I've had elsewhere is usually too bland or overpoweringly sweet and fake.  Instead, Smiling Banana Leaf has cemented itself in my mind as the gold standard for Pad Thai.  In the midst of stuffing my face with noodles, I managed to set aside some time to breathe and take in the atmosphere.  I'm glad I called ahead for a reservation because there were only a dozen or so tables in the restaurant--and it was packed.  The lighting was low and the setting was intimate.  I would definitely recommend this place for a date night--if you can control how fast you eat...  Remember to get a bottle of wine beforehand (unlike me).  It's BYOB.",

They roast their own chills on site, so their 2 might be hotter than some are used to. Their Pad Thai is one of the best we've ever had. They used to have fresh spring rolls but don't anymore, and that's the only reason I didn't rate the place a 5. Bring them back! Bring them back! It's BYOB, and I'm not sure if they have a corkage fee. They have outdoor dining during nice weather, but the indoor dining room is very small, and this is a popular place, so it's a good idea to make a reservation. Ample parking in the surrounding neighborhood. And the 71A and B stop right outside the door.",

The second time I visited my tofu could have been just a tad bit crispier, but the meal over all was pretty delicious.   It is small and the outside and inside decor does leave quite a bit to be desired. As some others have warned, watch out for the spiciness! My boyfriend ordered his meal at a 7 (out of 10) and his eyes were watering! His entire face turned red and he finished off two glasses of water by the time he was halfway through his meal lol! He did very much enjoy it, though.  I have only eaten at one other thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, but this one blows the other out of the water. It is also BYOB, which I have not partaken in, but keep that in mind!",

We had three appetizers: Thai Samosas, Chicken Stay and Tofu Paradise. Then my husband had the Seafood Pad Thai and I had the Chef's Specials: Prik Poa Talay. The food had a lot of flavor, fresh and crunchy veggies, spicy to your taste. The restaurant is small, with only 24 seats. From the outside you wouldn't imagine the warmth of the dinning room; there are pillows on the seats up against the wall, candles lit on every table and a beautiful mural on the ceiling.

    "text": "Please do not ever go here - the food is decent but the service will kill you!  Had I reviewed this place 8-10 months ago, it would get 4 stars from me for a very hospitable staff and consistently good food - always reminding me of True Thai hospitality. The food today is perhaps a notch below its old level but not bad. However, if you ask me why I am giving this place 1 star ( only because I can't give it a zero), here is my answer.   I have had 4 instances of extremely poor service ( specifically a male staff) - twice on takeouts and twice while dining in.  Takeouts - I had ordered curry and noodles. The lid on the containers was not even put on correctly and all my food spilled into the plastic carry bags and my car floor. I called in to let them know only to experience this yet another time.  Dining In - I liked their food especially when the place was run by a different manager who has been mentioned in earlier posts. It was my go-to for comfort food. Currently, this place is run by a guy who can't even speak proper English and has absolutely no regard for customer service. He is extremely rude and arrogant. About 5-6 months ago, my husband and I decided to celebrate a special occasion there. The server ( the same guy mentioned above) brought us water after a 20 minute wait and a couple requests. He did not take our order correctly and also did not bring our appetizers until the entrees came in. The food was ok and no longer as good as it used to be. Also, let me mention that this was a weeknight and there were only 2 other tables occupied along with us. This week, I decided to give them another chance hoping that things may have settled back to normal only to find the same server. He again did not take our order correctly - I did not get my soup & when we told him about it, he said that it was our fault and we did not even ask for 2 soups. We decided to take out the food and asked him to get the check. At that point, he said that he appreciates us not making a scene and that it was again \"our mistake\" and that we should understand it was a busy day. At that point, I was mad and I asked to speak to the owner/manager especially since this behavior was unacceptable and he said that \" he is the owner\". God forbid if that is actually True, this business is going down the drain pretty soon.   How can anyone ever go to this place anymore!",

Each time, I go and hope it'll be better--but it never is.   First: the chicken is pre-cooked before it's inserted into whatever curry you order. WHY hasn't anyone else realized this? It's always gummy, and sometimes it's downright odd-tasting. In fact, if you look through the kitchen doorway on the way in, you can SEE the big bin of pre-cooked chicken.   That's IF you manage to find the chicken in your selected curry at all. Last time I was there, I ordered the mussaman curry. As some other reviewer pointed out, it had crinkle-cut carrots in it. I ordered the extra chicken. The extra chicken tasted odd, but at least it was on the plate. The time before that, I got the green curry and it came with possibly eight pieces of thin chicken bits.  Another time, I ordered the pad thai. \"Pad thai,\" I thought, \"hard to f**k that up.\" It came in a nondescript brown sauce, no vegetables, very little tofu, and black bits stuck to the egg in the noodles.   The Pad See Ew is OK if you're hungry, but feels somewhat one-dimensional.  And then there's the issue of their fried dumplings. Who sticks these things in a deep fryer? The last time I had them, they were unpleasantly crispy and overly oily.   Anyway, I'm posting this because I can't for the life of me understand why this place is rated so highly. It's mediocre at best. Seriously.",

Everything was delicious, and the service on both visits was attentive and nice without being overly intrusive - which is hard for a restaurant with a tiny dining room.  Now that I've mentioned the tiny dining room, I can be honest. my biggest fear is not \"will I have a good meal?\" it's \"will there be a wait - I'm hungry!\" So far so good, but just for the record, it's food totally worth waiting for.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, too much time passes between my visits to Smiling Banana Leaf to recall the details of everything I've ordered before, with the exception of the pumpkin curry, which is phenomenal. However, over the course of half a dozen or so visits, I've never gone wrong with their menu. Their portions are generous (although I've found their pumpkin curry to be particularly huge compared to something like their garlic entree), their prices reasonable (especially for lunch!), and their staff is very friendly. The last time I dined there, it seemed like only 10 or 15 minutes passed between ordering and having my food delivered to the table (although that was during a pretty dead afternoon).  A word of caution: know your comfort level on the spiciness scale. The servers and kitchen are more than willing to make adjustments to food after it comes out, but I still wish I had a better understanding of their spiciness ranking system. As someone who considers herself somewhat adventurous with spice in average American cuisine (I know, I know--American cuisine spice is incredibly boring, comparatively), I have been shocked after ordering what I thought was middle-of-the-road spiciness. I think I said I wanted a five on a scale of ten once and I ended up combining my curry with all of my rice in an effort to dilute it, and even then I had to work through it slowly.  The restaurant is very small--maybe 10 tables--and does have a faint odor that seems to be related to a plumbing issue (I've noticed it more than once, months apart). Reservations are essential for peak dining times. However, sidewalk seating is available in fair weather, and takeout is a popular option--I've seen pick-up lines overflowing the entrance on several occasions. The BYOB option is great, although I can't recall whether they have a corking fee.  The neighborhood and nearby park--both called Highland Park--is a gorgeous place to take a walk after feeling stuffed from a dinner there. Still, I usually end up taking a second meal's worth of leftovers with me, only to want to relive the experience again by finishing it all as soon as I get home.",

The food is absolutely delicious.  I had the veggie pad thai which was made appropriately spicy as I requested.  It came out fresh, hot and full of veggies.  Seriously, the quality of food here rivaled some Thai restaurants I've been to out in the Bay Area where amazing Thai food is like a dime a dozen.   The outdoor seating is a great feature of this restaurant, especially on a nice cool evening when you can just hang out, eat some great food with great company and just people watch.  Almost like a cafe in some sense.  Very refreshing and unique.  Asides from the stupid bus stopping every 20 minutes by the corner of the restaurant, you almost forget that you're in Pittsburgh.  Seriously though, the value here is tremendous.  Plenty of food for your buck.  BYOB if that's thing your thing.  Service is solid and can be somewhat personable, which certainly isn't a bad thing.  Finally, a place that can go toe-to-toe with Pusadee's Garden; check it out!",

Great menu selection all my favorites were there Pumpkin Curry, Pineapple Curry, Spicy Green bean...on and on I want to try everything on the menu. I had given up on finding a Pad Thai that I liked in the burgh; one of the girls who is a Thai Nazi said I should give it a try!   Here is my review. I had the Veggie Pad Thai heat #3. I was slammed at work so had one taste, ran out of the room, turned around came back in. Took 2 big bites and \"mmmm'ed\"  Left the room to tell the girl that she was right. Best Pad Thai I have had in forever, or whatever I mumbled. Back into the room for one last bite. Worked for a couple hours busy. Had most of it left and thought it would be dinner. By the time 4pm rolled around my Pad Thai was finito and I want to order more tomorrow. Scratch that...right now!",

    "text": "In sum, the food here is mind-blowing and simply to die for...if eaten as a take-out or  to eat in person via a reservation only methinks. I prefer the former, I get a little claustrophobic sitting that close to complete strangers.   We are fortunate, us Pix'burgers to have a nice selection of Thai restaurants in the area. That being said this is the uncontested winner in my book. The servers are great, friendly, welcoming- it seems everyone enjoys working there. That is an excellent framework for any successful business. The parking can be rough, it is on Bryant Street. Any given weekend can make this messy. Best to use the buddy system. I call ahead for take-out, me husband drives a few laps around if his double parked car becomes an issue... I run in and grab the goods.  I ordered the Moo Yang for our starter. Grilled and mouth-watering, slightly smoky and sweetly marinated pork served on a bed of lovely greens. A nice pile of sticky rice to boot. Did I mention the dipping sauce? Not that the pork needs it, but seriously what is in this spicy plum sauce? I want to ask for extra next time and eat it with a spoon. Then again I am obsessed with dips, sauces and the like. If you are not- you are missing out! Nevertheless, the pork can stand on its own.  Soup. Oh dear. I am quite the sucker for coconut based broths. Let me tell you that the Tom Kha Soup is a pure creamy decadence of nirvana. I cannot say enough good things about this soup in general and especially their preparation of it. They obviously use a decent coconut milk. I honestly can say I can tell the difference. Moreover, the ginger or should I say the galangal the \"kha\" of the soup brings that sweet and zesty twist that complements the coconut milk fondly. A bit of mushroom, a hint of lemongrass, a splash of lime juice, and a dash of red chili paste (methinks) merry well together especially when one chooses to add the shrimp. I think non-shrimp eaters would like that one can add chicken, beef or tofu. But the shrimp, juicy medium sized scrimps! Love it.  I have a confession to make...I am that Thai-food customer...but it is okay- I can admit it...I love Shrimp Pad Thai. I order it every time I eat Thai food.   I know, I know. I cannot believe I am writing this in a such a public forum. I feel like I need to attend some sort of addiction group. \"Hi, my name is Jordana and I cannot resist ordering the same Thai entree every time we go out for Thai.\" Nothing is more run-of-the-mill than Shrimp Pad Thai. In that essence, I am not a daring food critic of sorts. But- I promise the next time I order a Thai entree I will go outside of my Pad-Thai comfort zone and share all the details with everyone. Nevertheless, their Shrimp Pad Thai is the best in the city! After all-who would know better than I the purported amateur Shrimp Pad Thai eater =)  Enjoy the food, I know you will =)",

I will admit that I might be the worst person to ever judge anything Thai, as this was one of the first times I've delved into this particular cuisine, but we showed up being in a hurry looking for a quick lunch only having about 45 minutes to get in and get out, and we were sat and served delicious Thai food with plenty of time to spare.  I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken and asked for a little spice. ( The server asked how spicy I wanted it on a scale of 1 to 10, and I'm pretty sure I said \"not too hot.\") My dish was brought out within ten minutes and I couldn't help but dive right in, even though it was steaming off the plate.  My Pad Thai was delicious. It was perfectly spiced, as it was spicy, but not too spicy to make me take a sip of water after every bite. I loved it, even though I ate it Americanized with a fork instead of chop sticks.   I will definitely come back and try some of what they have to offer for dinner and I'm looking forward to it.",

The restaurant was packed! Granted, the place is small, but business was definitely booming.   My husband and I ordered the chicken satay as an appetizer and the red curry and pad thai as our entrees. All of it was amazing. Loved the sauce that came with the chicken satay. I ordered my curry mild (level 3 on the spiciness scale) and it was perfect. I've noticed other people have mentioned the dishes weren't spicy enough - I guess I'm just a woos! My husband's pad thai was also tasty, probably some of the best pad thai I've had! Our server was attentive and friendly. They were the only server for the entire restaurant, but I never felt like we got lost in the crowd. My only complaint was not at the restaurant itself, but at my husband, haha! He forgot that it was BYOB and so we were left sipping on water. I don't think we'll forget a bottle of wine next time though!   This place also does take out, which I'm sure we'll take advantage of one of these days.",

    "text": "In my opinion, this might be the best Thai food in the city.  I just got done working a nightmarish shift at work, and decided to go with my coworker to get an early dinner.  I've been to this place before, and every time have had a pleasant experience.  This time was no exception.  I got the red curry with beef (spicy level 9), and started off with some calamari. After having a brief discussion with the...absent server, I managed to get my calamari out to the table.  The calamari was great as always.  Not overly breaded, great soft texture, and the sweet chili sauce was a much better option than the typical marinara.  The curry took a little long getting out, but made up for it as I took the first bite.  The rice was a colorful blend of different grain rices, and there was a generous portion of curry.  The flavor was great, and it was almost as spicy as I would have wanted it.  Home run.  Now for the reason that put it short of five stars.  The service.  The server, who had some sort of European accent, was friendly, but seemed to be overwhelmed, which as a member of the service industry, I couldn't believe.  There was 3 tables other than myself in there, and he seemed pretty weeded.  My calamari came up after my curry, but he was apologetic, and get them out in a timely fashion, and kept my food hot in the back while me and my coworker ate our appetizer.  My water glass was empty within 5 minutes of sitting down, and remained empty until I was halfway finished with my meal, which was the only thing that really bothered me about my meal.  All in all, regardless of the service, I would go to Smiling banana leaf whenever I'm craving Thai food.  The portions are large, the prices are fair, and the food is amazing.",

This (from Yelp reviews) is supposed to be the best Thai in the city, but it's really just below average Thai food.   We tried new things this time and with each bite, I kept thinking about Sripraphai in NY. That restaurant both spoiled and ruined me.  The panang curry was watery, lifeless, and just really sad. A few strips of carrots and bell pepper. 4 small broccoli and a few pieces of pork. Really?? For that price?  The fried calamari was overly breaded that I couldn't taste the squid. If you told me they were onion rings, I might believe you. Also a severely small portion.  The sticky rice we ordered was HALF A CUP size. I was floored!  The papaya salad was fine, but I was most disappointed that our waitress didn't give us the dessert menu. She took away our plates and just handed us the check. From what my boyfriend told me, she's a terrible waitress (the short one).  As my boyfriend and I were walking out of the restaurant, we both agreed that it will be the last time we go there. I'm just going to bring him Thai food from Sripraphai straight off the plane.",

Thai food isn't just about recreating those classic flavors we love, but it's also different types of textures come to together. Having dined in Thailand (and not fine dined) I'm talking food straight from the sh*$ holes of Bangkok and inner alleys of Phuket, where mom and grandma's recipes take pride and precedence.   SBL does it right. The meats are cooked PERFECTLY and the curries are have the perfect creaminess to them and the right balance of coconut to spice ratio. Yeah the cliche satay and peanut sauces are there, but what American Thai joint is complete without one. Necessary evil but it's still cooked and grilled to perfection.  Now is it a place bursting with merriment, energy, and hype? No. Is the decor anything to write home about in this little tucked away street in Highland Park? Nope.  But that's what I like about it.  Simple in appearance but complex in flavor.  Overall, a real winner. Best Thai in PGH, period.",

My dining experience:  This is a great place to bring a group because they take reservations and the food is very customizable. The decor is lovely, as well.  Thai food is a favorite with me, especially when the restaurant is friendly to vegetarians.  I had the tofu paradise and the pineapple fried rice (veg). We brought our own wine, and they were very helpful about keeping it chilled. The prices are great for the amount of food that you get.  My catering experience:  Yes, they cater! And yes, they deliver! I was very happy about this.  I ordered pad thai with tofu and the chicken panang curry. I had 60 people to feed, so I ordered a total of 60 dinner portions (30 of the tofu, 30 of the curry). This was waaaay too much food. You can get away with lunch portions and maybe even reducing the number of portions that you order.  The food was a big hit, especially since they brought a spice mix on the side so that people could customize their food. The price was the same as their in-house price, plus a discount for ordering above some amount. Overall it was around $10 per person, which is amazing for catering of such quality.  The food was on time and they helped me carry it in as well. Very great experience!",

    "text": "Smiling Banana Leaf is just average. They are not bad but I think there are a lot of much better thai restaurants around Pittsburgh. Because Pittsburgh has so many thai restaurants to choose from there's much more competition to be the best restaurant. It also makes me a little more picky when critiquing a restaurant because there are so many good ones to choose from around the city.  I started with the vegetarian spring rolls which I did not like at all. They were dry and tough and hardly any flavor. I also ordered the Tom Kha soup which was so good. And my entree was the mango tilapia which was decent but a tad too much sauce.  I don't regret eating there however I don't think I'll bother going back.",

I love that it a BYOB and all of my friends bought a bottle with us. Unlike other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh they don't charge you a fee to bring your bottles. That's a plus. I started off with the fresh spring rolls with tofu. Very good and light for an appetizer. If you weren't too hungry they could have been a meal. They came out pretty fast. I ordered the green curry at an 8. I actually ordered a 5 but they gave me an 8 on accident. I was fine with it and decided not to say anything. To me it was fine and it wasn't too much heat for me. It was perfect spiciness to where I could still taste the food. The prices are good and with an appetizer and an entree my meal came to under $20. I would come back here when I come back to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "So I absolutely love Thai food. It very well may be my favorite cuisine choice. While my meal here was not bad, I didn't think the overall experience was spectacular and for that reason, if I was going to get Thai food, I don't think I'd travel here to get it. Don't get me wrong, it was very good and if I was around here I would certainly not be opposed. It's just not my favorite. Perhaps I got my hopes up too high based on other reviews and expected too much. Our waitress was nice and prices were average for a nice dinner place.   Anyway, the place is very small but was cozy and not cramped. We had a reservation but when we got there, the two people working the door were totally confused by the fact that we said we had one. Regardless, they fortunately had an open table so we didn't wait. Our waitress was very nice. Our apps included the fried tofu and crab Rangoon. The fried tofu was nothing to write home about but I'd certainly get the Rangoon again.   I always get the red curry with vegetable and tofu. It was wonderfully flavorful and had the perfect level of spice for me at a 3. The one thing I love is pineapple in my red curry which this did not have. My greatest disappointment was when they told me I couldn't have sticky rice for dessert because the microwave was broken! What!?! That has to embarrassing for any restaurant. Such a shame.   Check it out if you're around but I wasn't blown away.",

I had the yellow curry noodle bowl with vegetables - massive portion, yummy noodles, incredible flavors. I especially loved the crunch of onions on top which isn't something I've seen before. We also tried the crab Rangoon which was some of the best I've had - but for $6 I think it could come with more than 5 pieces. This is a really intimate spot - not many tables so definitely make a reservation if possible. Parking is easy in this area so that's not a worry.",

    "text": "I wanna clear this first of that this one star rating is not for the food. This one star review is for the service and how we were treated in that restaurant as customers. Me and my husband with two of our friends went there on a Sunday, we checked yelp for their hours and it clearly said 9:00pm by the time we reached the entrance of the restaurant the time was 8:11pm exactly! When we entered there was a gentleman sitting there (somewhat in his 20's) he asked \"how many?\" We said \"four\". Meanwhile an older women came and said \" we close at 9:00\" I replied, \"I know\" instantly took my phone out to check what the time was it said \"8:12\" the lady then goes on and says \" okay, I am the one who has to clean afterwards.\" I was surprised/shocked at her words. She was awfully rude and arrogant. However, we were seated and there were a lot of tables with people. There was another girl who sat us and gave us menus and water, which took two mins at the most. The lady who was at the door was apparently our server and right after the girl gave us water she came to the table for the order remind you this is our first time at this restaurant also, it was first time for Thai cuisine for one of our friend. The lady was clearly not happy when we said we are not yet ready to place an order. She left and came back with in 3 mins and said \"okay now what's it gonna be? We don't have a lot of time the kitchen closes at 9.\"  We were really out of words because it wasn't even 8:20 at that point. Anyways we ordered and by the time she took our order and left our table it was 8:20 we got our food by 8:35. Our server never came to our table to ask how we are doing or anything the other girl came and checked on us. We the left the restaurant by 8:55. We are never going back there. But I hope they learn how to respect their customers and be polite with them.",

Green curry ordered a 6 hot which I think was good and manageable. The rice was warm and perfectly sticky, eggplant in the curry was buttery and flavorful. Chicken was spot on not dry, not meager- green beans were a bit tough and it would have been nice to have had some pods in there, but overall the curry was very delicious. Price point was good as well - got me out to Highland Park which I never venture to - Bryant St. has promise. Will definitely come back :)",

The mild has a kick so the medium might blow your head off. Pumpkin curry is good but am a little curious about the diced carrot and pea mixture in there. I am guessing since the dice on the carrot was perfect and exact that this was from a frozen bag mix which upsets me. The curry fried rice had veges in it though that looked fresh and cut by a human so then I felt relief. My daughter tried the duck curry and said the duck was fattier than she is used to so I am not sure how to rate it.",

    "text": "I love coming to Smiling Banana Leaf, and even if you haven't been how can you not giggle at the thought of it with a restaurant name like that? This gem is tucked away in residential neighborhood and for those who find it are in for a treat. The space is small (we're talking maybe 6-8 tables) but the atmosphere is cozy and intimate. It feels really calm too. Service has always been awesome. You're greeted with a smile and the staff has been very polite - they check up on you to make sure the experience has been good throughout the meal.  And now on to the food - everything that we've had has been so scrumptious from the calamari and samosas to the curry dishes, pad sew yew, chef specials (mango tilapia) and fried rice. We haven't gone wrong yet.  The portions are just right though do be warned if you don't want  your food spicy at all make sure you make it clear. We've asked for dishes that have a spicy level of 2 and others that have a level of 6 and they both seemed to be equally hot. Even with the discrepancy, plates have been wiped clean. To boot the food is cheap.  We just keep coming back for more that if there was a tshirt with a smiling banana leaf I would just buy one.",

I had the duck noodle soup, my wife had the Chef's chicken special, and my son had the pumpkin curry, which was plenty spicy for me at number 5!  Everything was very tasty, well presented, and indeed, incredibly reasonable in price.  Dinner for three with tip for less than 40 bucks.  (We didn't do the BYOB thing, but it's definitely an option.)  As is often the case in Pittsburgh, we meandered through quite a few interesting neighborhoods en route, and I was a little leery when we pulled up to park.  But once inside, the place is modest, but nicely decorated.  Showing up after 5:00 on a Saturday night without a confirmed reservation seems like it would surely lead to disappointment!    Still learning about the nuance of Thai cooking, but thinking this has set a nice baseline for our future exploration!",

The spice level of 5 should suffice but if you want to add some kick to your food you should get 6-8. The service is good and prices are reasonable. The menu has a lot of good options.

The place is tiny and it's a very intimate atmosphere with soft candlelight. It's a great place to take a date and it's BYOB.   The food is fantastic. Consistently. Also, I like that they don't try to dumb down the spice level of their dishes. If you're averse to hot and spicy food, make sure that you tell them as you order your food. On a scale of 1-10...   The place is within walking distance of my home and the staff always remembers my name. I am smitten with this place.",

We both enjoyed the flavors very much, and I noted that the veggies used were great choices.  I thought that the portion size was a bit small compared to what I've received at other Thai places.  I also was not that happy with the shrimp.  They were very chewy, and it might have been because it was to-go and they sat in hot liquid and got overcooked, but either way, the flavor wasn't very fresh on the shrimp either.  I would say the goods outweighed the bads though, and I would probably just get a vegetarian version next time.  The service was pleasant and quick for how busy they were.",

Only downside is we were expecting lunch portion prices (we went on a Sunday) but they only do dinner portions on weekends no matter the time of day. They could have been more transparent with that, which is the reason for the 4 star rating. Easily 5 star food though.",

I remember finding their basil fried rice to be decent several years ago, but a bit salty for my tastes.  In my most recent visit here, we ordered fresh rolls, massaman curry with chicken, and khao soi with chicken.  The fresh rolls were fine, but nothing special.  I would not order them again here if I paid another visit.  The massaman curry was too watered down and did not pack enough flavor (beyond being spicy).  It also was full of carrots, which is non-traditional for massaman curry -- not to mention they are zig-zag cut, which is kind of tacky.  The Khao Soi curry noodle dish was better, but still not great.  For example, the Chiang Mai noodles at Noodlehead (a very similar dish) are a few dollars cheaper and MUCH better than this Khao Soi.  Overall, I think this restaurant is about on par with other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh (Thai Cuisine, Thai Gourmet), but next time I go out for Thai it will be back to Noodlehead!",

The Panang just had the right amount of coconut and spices.  Unadulterated by starch it was just the right thickness.  The rice is Thai jasmine \"milagrosa\" not the cheap long grain that most other restaurants serve.  If they could only serve it on a bed of bans leaf it would seal the experience.  The tofu was most welcome after eating on travel much of last week.  The mango tilapia dish had their version of the mango chutney in sweet sour sauce.  Definitely a gem to visit at Bryant Street Pittsburgh.",

The appetizer was good, but the main entrees was outstanding!  I had the red curry with shrimp at a spicy level of 10. This was an actual 10. The kitchen uses fresh red chilies which make for a very spicy dish. I needed four napkins to blow my nose and wipe my tears. This might not be ideal for all; however, for those seeking serious spiciness, then smiling banana leaf has what you're looking for. Overall, it was an excellent curry. If you're not a fan of overly spicy dishes, then you can have the dish prepared at a lower spice level.  One of the drawbacks is that the restaurant  is quite small. We had to wait 30+ minutes for a table for two without a reservation. This wasn't a terrible inconvenience since there is a pub down the street. Just note that SBL is quite busy on Saturdays between dine in patrons and take out orders.  I would rate this restaurant four and a half stars if I could.",

A dish this simple can be easily made to taste like dirty bath water with clumps of soap.  However, this place pulls off a perfect symphony of delightfulness for your taste buds.  Now that I have waxed on the poetry of the soup, I just want to say that Thai and pineapple versions of fried rice are excellent, along with the massaman curry dishes and the pad kee mow (spicy noodles) dishes.  Pick any meat or stick with the vegetarian versions and you can't go wrong.  Additionally, the hostess is extremely friendly and accomodating here, which is a departure from some smaller Thai restaurants.  All in all, you can't go wrong at the Smiling Banana Leaf!  P.S.

The selection is pretty good, and they have both lunch (weekday) and dinner portions for most of their curries, noodles, and specials. Everything sounds good, so it is often hard to choose what to eat!  Personally, I've found the pad see ew and green curry to be very good. The noodles in the pad see ew are addicting, while the curry has just the right amount of flavor. The one time we tried the pad thai, we thought it was okay but probably not as good as that of Thai Gourmet.   In any case, those are just some of the more common things, so we are hoping to try other more unique dishes in future visits. One thing to keep in mind is that place is a bit small, and the seating arrangement while interesting is a bit awkward with unconventional chairs and weird pillows on a hard bench.",

The food was worthy of 4 stars - we had Tom yam and Tom kha soups, both very tasty and well done - possibly worthy of 4.5 stars! Our entrees were Kao soy noodles and chilli shrimp with rice. Both tasted great! But the chilli shrimp was $14 and only came with 6 regular sized shrimp and a ton of vegetables. A bit too few for the price. The Kao Soy had a generous serving of pork.   My 3 star review is based on the service we received. While it wasn't bad, our server, a young girl, was not very warm or pleasant, which made the atmosphere that night feel very cold. I just felt very uneasy with the service we received - or waitress was also more interested in sitting down and playing with her phone right in front of the entrance rather than putting a smile on her face.  Overall, food is good, but I have had better overall experiences at other Thai restaurants in Burgh.",

    "text": "The place is decorated nice and its clean! lol The food is really good! I love spicy food but don't usually find restaurant food that spicy. Smiling banana leaf is an exception!! My husband loves the pad thai on a level 10 spicy but I can only take level 8. The spicy green beans with chicken is my favorite dish (level 8). Yesterday, I tried it with pork and it was an epic fail! The pork was really chewy. I like my meat (except for bacon) very well done. The first time my husband and I ate there we actually dined in which was a big mistake! My friend told me it was intimate but she should have told me it was a crack in the wall (not a hole but a tiny crack). There was only one waitress/hostess for the WHOLE restaurant! Be prepared to be thirsty because it might take a while to get a refill. The seats are very uncomfortable! I felt like I was back in high school sitting on the bleachers with a numb butt. The waitress was nice but she didn't know BASIC restaurant etiquette. I asked for a straw and chopsticks and she gave me both of them unwrapped with her hands all over it! Gross! Keep in mind she is a waitress/hostess so she was touching money,the cash register, menus, and 5 millions other things... okay maybe I'm a bit of a germophob   OH and how can I forget... the bathroom!! The whole time I was hoping and praying that no one would go to the bathroom and do number 2. The whole restaurant would smell it... yes, the place is that small.   Things to take from this review: 1. The food is great! 2. ALWAYS get the food to-go.",

Everyone answered any questions that we may have had and had plenty of patience.   I order the beef Rad Na which compared to what I have had at other Thai establishments throughout the US it was much soupier than what I am used to but still very flavorful. The Tom Yum soup was very much in line with what I have experienced if not better than other places.   The only real issue I had was with the seating setup in this place. Since we had a large group we had a table that had a wall mounted bench that was just too high for the table. My buddy and I basically had to sit with our waists at table level, A little bit of oversight during design and construction, not that big of a deal but worth mentioning.  Check it out.",

    "text": "Food: The menu has so many \"good-sounding\" entrees that its difficult to choose what to eat.  Its typical Thai cuisine with curries, noodles, soups, or rice/fried rice options.  There are plenty of vegetarian options, as would be expected, and more than enough meat too.  We ordered the fresh spring rolls which were very fresh and tasty.  The Tom Yum comes in a very large bowl, the biggest I've had in Pittsburgh, and was great.  Entrees are ordered on the 1-10 spicy scale and come with your choice of meat or tofu/veggies.  We ordered a curry dish, which was good but a little bland, not as potent or spicy as we anticipated or would have preferred.  We also ordered a spicy bean dish which came with an excellent sauce and the correct amount of spice based on the number we selected.  The servings are large and we had enough to bring home.  We didn't try dessert, but there were 4-5 options.  Overall, the food was far above average, but not incredible.  Price: Smiling Banana Leaf is very modestly priced.  Entrees ranged from $10-12, soups around $3.50 and appetizers for $4-5.  The quality of food and atmosphere are excellent considering the price of a meal here.  Drinks: BYOB.   Atmosphere: The dining area is very small, and only accommodates about 20 people.  The decor is cozy and there is soothing music, not played too loud, in the background.  The tables are close together, but not so close you feel like you're sitting on top of each other.  Although, it is hard to get to the bathroom without asking someone to move.  It may be wise to make a reservation due to the small size of the dining room.  Despite the room being small, it didn't feel loud or distracting.  Service: The service was great, and our waitress, who appeared to be the owner or manager, was funny, engaging, and seemed genuinely pleased to be serving us.  She had a great attitude and made the dining experience more enjoyable.  Our water could have been replaced a few more times, but our food came very fast (almost too fast) and we didn't have to wait long for our check despite a packed dining room due to Valentine's Day weekend.  (+): cozy dining room, friendly staff, very affordable  (-): tables tightly packed  Would I go back again? Yes. Worth the drive to Highland Park, especially if you're on a budget.",

I've also had the spring rolls, fried rice, thai ice tea and thai ice coffee, all of which are terrific as well.  Apart from the food, I must say that the gracious service really makes this place.  Practically everyone here is warm, polite and attentive.  Particularly the tall woman who remembers what I order every time and recently spoiled my friends & I to some free after dinner ice cream.  The only tiny flaws are the portions are slightly smaller (though still less expensive) than some other places I've gone to.  I've lucked out and never had to wait for a table inside but I can see that may be a problem in the winter time.    I do highly recommend it.  One of the many gems of Highland Park.",

The wait wasnt very long but the servers werent  very happy i was by myself.   i found it humorous that i was being discriminating against because of my numerology.  I was even asked if i would prefer take out, i declined of course.  Than, after being seated at a table for four I was asked to switch to a table of three (in mid meal mind you) to accomodate the party of four coming in.   I laughed through the entire ordeal and really didnt blame them.  Like they say in golf \"The ONESOME has no power.\"  Ok enough about me and onto the food.  I started off with a fresh shrimp roll.   It came as advertised, fresh, crunchy and sweet.  For a main course i ordered the pumpkin curry with chicken.  I have never ordered this before so i do not have anything to compare it too.  it came in bowl filled with chicken and pumpkin chunks.  A plate of rice was also served.  It must be ignorance but it always seems like thai places never serve enough rice to go with the curries.  The curry was delicious and the broth had a mild pumpkin flavor but when you included the pumpkin in your bite it had the perfect flavor.     It was an entertaining but more importantly a delicious meal and I would definitely go back especially in the spring because they do have two tables for outdoor seating.",

    "text": "Visiting from Toronto, we decided to try this place based on its Yelp reviews. Let me just start by saying Toronto has a TON of Thai restaurants; none of which compared to this one.   This was hands down, THE BEST Thai food I have ever eaten in my life. So fresh. So delicious. So tasty. This place KILLED it.   We had the pork spring rolls, chicken satay skewers, pad Thai and rad na bowl. All were amazing.   Honestly; if you live in Pittsburgh and have never been or you're just visiting and looking for a good authentic Thai place (situated in a cool neighbourhood setting). THIS IS THE PLACE!  Do yourself the favour and get yourself here! ASAP! Your tastebuds will thank you.",

Smiling Banana Leaf is delicious! I ordered the Chicken Paradise which is essentially chicken, veggies, and peanut sauce. The Peanut Sauce was unlike I've had anywhere else. It had a very creamy consistency and the peanut taste was definitely there but not too much. It was a beautiful balance. The only thing I disliked was that I ordered a 7 (on a scale of 1-10 for spicy) and it wasn't spicy at all.   This will be my new go to Thai place!",

The wait was 45 minutes which is actually a bit longer than their usual wait for take out. When I got there, they only had thought I wanted one order. I was charged for one and rather than wait any longer, I just left. Perhaps some closed loop communication when taking orders over the phone would help with this. Went here yesterday and had the pineapple curry with chicken. The chicken was not cooked enough and I felt a little sick after eating it. Not sure if there's new staff or something but I'm hoping these were both isolated events because like I said this place has always been great.",

We came around 6 on a Saturday for dinner, and the other tables were all already taken.   I ordered the Pumpkin Curry at a spice level 3, and my friend ordered the pineapple fried rice at a spice level 7. Surprisingly, her dish was not much spicier than mine if at all. This was my first time trying Pumpkin curry so I don't have much to compare it to, but it was delicious! It was very rich and creamy with a nice sweetness from the coconut milk and pumpkin. The portion sizes were huge as well, and we left stuffed with plenty of leftovers to take home. Overall I was impressed with the food and I will definitely continue coming here for a Thai fix!",

The restaurant is on the smaller end but I've always come at an off hour, and even if there were other customers, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes. It might be a different story during the more popular hours (dinner time), so make a reservation!   I get a spice level of 7/10. It has a good kick but not to the point where I'm sweating. So I would say it's a comfortable level for those who enjoy spicy foods!  What I've ordered: - Tom Yum Soup with Mushroom: Pretty good! It's a good portion size for an appetizer, so I would get this again if I'm in the mood for something spicy and sour! - Koy Soy (yellow curry noodle): I get this almost every time I come here.  I can only manage to finish half and I take the rest for another meal. I love the curry that comes in this noodle and I eat it with some rice later for a second meal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  - Pad Thai: I'm pretty picky with Pad Thai because usually they don't stand out. But in my opinion, this place has the best Pad Thai. It's the perfect combo of sweet and savory! ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Mango Sticky Rice: They served this to me with slightly warmed sticky rice and it was life changing. It is certainly more smoother and creamier when served warm than with cold rice!! Best Thai dessert!  Highlights: - excellent quality food - addictively tasty - good portion sizes - reasonable prices! - friendly, responsive service - outside seating for warmer weather.  For these reasons, this is my favorite Thai place (:",

To have three dishes that can't be topped elsewhere calls for 5 stars.   I like the noodles here because they come in large servings, spice-levels seem accurate, and they are generous with the protein and vegetables. The noodles also seem to have a savory smokey flavor (perhaps from the wok), that I have not tasted anywhere else. In addition to great food, I've never had an issue with service. The wait staff are always friendly and the food always arrives quickly.   Although the space is small, the food is worth the tiny squeeze.",

The restaurant space is unique with decorative pillows alongside the perimeter bench seats.  The spice level is no joke - its legit.  I choose a 6-7 / 10.  Spicy enough for me.

I am a bit if a Thai enthusiast and have been impressed by both the quality and the portion sizes of the dishes. However, I have to give it a 3 for these reasons:   Every time I eat there, I'm cold. Truthfully, I run typically at a lower temperature than most, but when your boyfriend also needs to keep his winter coat on throughout the whole meal, you know it's too cold.   Cosy or cramped? There is definitely a fine line. Also, the height of the booths does not measure up to the height of the table nor the chair sitting across from it. So if you're sitting on the booth side, you're going to be much awkwardly higher than the person who's sitting across from you.  Thirdly, they use a very strong cleaning product or soap in the bathroom that is right off the dining room, so you get that smell pretty much the whole time.   I would still return because I love the good so much (particularly the pad see ew and the cashew chicken) and it is a sweet place for a date. I do wish above all they would turn up the heating in the restaurant, especially during winter!!",

    "text": "Last weekend, my boyfriend and I set out to satisfy our craving for Thai food.  After driving out to Pusadee's Garden and discovering it was closed, we did a quick Yelp search for the next closest place...and ended up at Smiling Banana Leaf.  After a short 15-20 minute wait, we were seated at a table in the tiny dining room.  Not a bad wait, considering we didn't have a reservation.  I ordered tom yum soup and green curry with tofu and couldn't have been happier with my selections.  They will ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your food, and they aren't afraid to really add some heat.  The portions are large, the food is flavorful and spicy, and everything came out quickly.  My boyfriend, who ordered the tom kha soup and panang curry, was equally as happy.  We left Smiling Banana Leaf full, happy, and with leftovers that tasted even better the next day.  After our dinner at Smiling Banana Leaf, I craved that green curry all week long.  I even went so far as to attempt to make my own green curry.  And I've never made any sort of curry in my life.  Needless to say, I think I'll leave it to the chefs at Smiling Banana Leaf.  We decided to make our second trip to the restaurant less than a week later.  We rarely eat at the same place twice, especially so soon after our first visit.  But we had to make an exception for this place.  This time, we planned ahead by making reservations and bringing a bottle of wine.  I decided to switch it up and try the tofu eggplant with basil, which was tasty but came out a bit cold.  My boyfriend again went with the panang curry, and enjoyed it just as much the second time.  Next time, I will probably switch back to a curry as well.  Overall, I would highly recommend Smiling Banana Leaf.   The service is always super speedy and friendly, the food is delicious, and the value is great.  Considering how small the dining room is (probably seats about 25 people), I would suggest making a reservation.  It can also get quite loud when the dining room is full.  Keep in mind that the restaurant is also BYOB. I would rate this restaurant a 4.5/5 if I could, but for now I'll give it a 5.",

    "text": "I liked this place but didn't love it.  My Tom Kha soup tasted like pure coconut milk, I could not detect the lemongrass, or the cilantro. Also too sweet.  My pad Thai was forgettable, again too sweet. I forget whether a spice tray is offered here, I am sure one is.  Spice levels are not very hot.   Parking is on the street do not park where the buses need to go (i think they are marked do not park to be fair). But my meal was repeatedly interrupted because of this. A little frustrated but it was not the owners fault, it was \"black BMW and black Benz\" as the manager asked over and over owners fault. So parking can be limited.   No problems with service I just felt the food was a little over on the sweet side, the layering of spices was wrong. It is ok if you are tipping your toes into Thai.   If you want authentic Thai over the Americanized version this is not it.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to head over here after seeing all of the glowing reviews on Urbanspoon. Also, it's practically in my back yard and I'm always up for some Thai food.  The problem with most Thai restaurants is that nothing really sets them apart. If you were blindfolded and a number of Pittsburgh Thai restaurants set down plates of the same dish you'd probably have a very hard time picking them apart. Luckily, The Smiling Banana Leaf managed to carve itself a niche in the Thai-saturated streets of Pittsburgh.  Just by looking at the bustle inside the restaurants shows you how good the place is. There's only five tables inside yet they are always filled with happy, hungry people. Customers are constantly coming in and out for take-out and the smells coming from the kitchen are amazing. The restaurant is intimate without being intimidating. The server we had was great. She was very upbeat and made small talk with us. She kept our waters filled and was attentive even though she was responsible for all five tables and a lot of the take-out ordering. Her warm demeanor alone makes The Smiling Banana Leaf the kind of restaurant you want to come back to.  The food was excellent, by the way. To start we branched out from our usual and got \"Tofu Paradise\". The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft, warm and flavorful on the inside. The peanut sauce, something I usually do not care for, was smooth and perfectly balanced between sweet and savory. It went well with the veggies that were cooked but still crispy.  The Tom Yum soup was served in a heaping bowl and had a brilliant red color to it. The pieces of chicken were hearty and the lemon grass was delicious. It wasn't my favorite, though. I like the soup to be really sour and this was more sweet tasting. To each his own, though! It was still prepared expertly. The fact that their dishes vary in flavor to other restaurants means to me that the chef is taking great care in cooking his food. It's like all cooking, depending on the tastes of the cook certain flavors may be emphasized or downplayed.  I ordered the Spicy Green Bean entree and thought it was delicious. The sauce was spicy and tangy but also had some curry notes to it. Occasionally the spiciness would subside and you'd get smooth hints of coconut. Usually I'm not a fan of Thai sauces but I found myself sopping it up with my chicken and veggies.  For dessert we had the epitomical Thai dessert, Thai custard and sticky rice. The portions were perfect for two people and much more generous than I usually get. The bill at the end of the meal was very fair and surprisingly cheap.  The Smiling Banana Leaf is my new favorite Thai Place. It absolutely oozes charm.",

Luckily, I was able to squeeze into a small, one-person table and avoid the wait.  It was late summer or early fall, I don't really remember, but you could definitely feel autumn in the air. I went here for the sole purpose of getting pumpkin curry. I was greeted with a friendly hello and seated promptly. The food arrived quickly and I loved it. Even though the place was \"packed\", it was still a nice, quite time. The dining area is very small and cozy, so I guess there is no need to be loud if talking within your table like some other restaurants.  After my initial stop, I've called and ordered pick-up food a few times. After seeing how small the place is and how long you may have to wait to get a table, I figured it's just as easy to get some food to go and eat it at home. Even if it is take-out, it is still a very nice portion and very worth it. I think if I ever decide to go back to eat there, I'll call ahead and make a reservation.",

Atmosphere/decor - Neat, modern, but extremely small. Usually extremely crowded, especially on weekends.  Food - Each time the food has been pretty good. It is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh with regards to the food. The portions are not small, definitely filling. I usually order their curry, especially the roast duck curry. Today, we ordered a beef curry and the roast duck. We ordered one at spice level 5 and the other 3. Neither was overly spicy, but we couldn't tell the difference between the spiciness.   Service - It's alright. Waiters/waitresses are quite friendly but always seem to be busy. When it's crowded, be prepared to wait for awhile for your food.  Compared to other Thai places in Pittsburgh, Smiling Banana Leaf is one of the better ones, but personally I would prefer Thai Gourmet just because it is usually less crowded and more spacious.",

First of all, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to find street parking nearby the restaurant (that's usually something that I dread).  Then they sat us at a nice table by the corner window, and we were the only ones in there for the majority of our meal.  My friend ordered the fresh roll of the day (it was shrimp and was pretty good) and pineapple fried rice (spice level: 5). I ordered the crispy taro spring roll (which was excellent) and the pad see ew (spice level: 6).  We both enjoyed our food, but it was huge portions so we needed to take about half home.  Our food came out to us with record-breaking speed, and both dishes had a lot of flavor. My only warning would be with regard to the spice level.  I like spicy food, and I thought I was being safe by ordering a 6 (out of 10), and it was still pretty darn hot (pore-sweating hot)! Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",

The patio on our random 80 degree October days is also perched nicely in a cute neighborhood. I had the Veggie Pad See Ew, delicious! The hub had Panang Curry, which left a little to be desired. We also had the calamari which was pretty good also! Overall, I would say stick with traditional thai noodle dishes-but we left pretty satisfied.

    "text": "Right off the bat, I have to give this place one more star than Bangkok Balcony.  I went to look for my Bangkok Balcony review, and realized that I had never written one.  Well....at least now you know how many stars Bangkok Balcony gets before I write a review!  I had tried to visit this place once before today, but when I called in to try to reserve a table for 5 at 7PM two hours before, they were booked until 930PM with no space even for walkins.  So, yes. MAKE A RESERVATION.  I made one more than a day in advance for 2 at 7:15PM on a thursday evening.  Parking was pretty easy; I found a number of free street side spots along Euclid Ave, north of Bryant St.    The very first thing I noticed before I visited the restaurant was their marked difference in price.  For the same dishes, Smiling Banana Leaf had at least a 2-3 dollar price advantage on almost all the main dishes compared to those at Bangkok Balcony.  The only two things that were to be determined at dinnertime were quality and quantity.  We ordered and split a Som Tum (papaya salad) spiciness level 5, Red Curry with chicken spiciness level 5, and basil pork spiciness level 5.  The red curry was delicious: not too rich like some places make them (with regular coconut milk instead of low fat coconut milk), and just the right quantity. the papaya salad was actually perched upon a bed of greens, a change from the usual way I have it (without the bed of greens, obviously).  there was a tad bit too much dressing, which I will take a note of next time i order the dish, which was otherwise tasty.  lastly, the pork of the basil pork was slightly tough. the pork didn't seem very fresh or something, perhaps due to the fact that most people order chicken.  not sure though: i wouldn't deter anyone from trying it!  Cutting this review short, someone in my vicinity is complaining that i'm writing a novel. so...good thai iced tea! potent tea flavor without too much of that condensed milk mixed in (usually the point of failure in man other establishments).  In summary, I'll be coming here from now on.  Cheers for great Thai food in Pittsburgh!",

The food, however, left me a little underwhelmed, although I admittedly have high standards for Thai food. The appetizers that I ordered were spot on; the fresh rolls with shrimp were refreshing and light, while the satay chicken had great flavor and came with delicious sauces. The red curry, which I ordered with vegetables, was way too sweet. Achieving the right balance in curry can be hard, but this one was so sweet that I had to force myself to finish the portion I had on my plate. On another visit, I ordered the Pad Thai which seemed like it was missing something. The flavors weren't developed and I didn't enjoy it. The service is warm and personal, although the restaurant is always busy. Give it a try; you might love it, like some of my friends, or you might like other places better, but it's worth a shot.",

    "text": "Yelp'd \"thai food\" while visiting Pittsburgh and ended up here.  Probably a good thing we visited it between Christmas and New Year's because it is TINY and presumably less crowded due to the timing...a great neighborhood restaurant, but if they take reservations I would strongly encourage (we were 4 and just walked in...and probably got a little lucky that a table was open). I'm almost strictly a Phad Thai and spring roll person, so that's the basis of my review.  The fried spring rolls were good, but, disappointingly, they were room temperature...as if they had been fried earlier and deliberately served that way...call me picky, I like to feel like they just came out da frier.  The Phad Thai, however, was quite tasty.  I've had better in PA, but that's no complaint, this was still pretty darn good. Good portion size, fair pricing. I would certainly recommend this place...very quaint...very neighborhood...probably an awesome place to walk to on a nice summer evening if you live in the area, but also worth the jaunt if you're an out-of-towner (be warned, parking can be a challenge).  And there's a cool coffee/pastry shop about 2 blocks away that's good too (but the name slips my mind...something with \"Enrico\" in it).",

Nice decor and quaintly small inside.  Street parking is surprisingly ample, which makes the drive to Highland Park worth it.  Reasonably priced, the food is full of flavor and not greasy, which I've experienced at other Thai and Pan Asian establishments around Pgh.  As much as I love this place, I wouldn't recommend the fresh spring rolls (For spring rolls, check out the Vietnamese Pho restaurant in the Strip).  Banana's version are a little bland in comparison to the greatness of their other dishes.  Either way, this place is a must!",

Rivals the best curries I've had in Thai restaurants across the South.

    "text": "I was looking for a Japanese place to eat at in highland park but they were close so this Thai place was th next best option. I had seen several reviews on yelp and it's high rating made me very curious so me and my hubby decided to try it... The space is very small inside yet cozy for a midweek afternoon lunch...there's only enough seating for 20 people max but the new sofa chairs they have are extremely comfortable and roomy. We ordered the fresh roll app along with the samosa. The samosa were small triangle shaped pastries stuffed with a potatoe mixture that was somewhat sweet and decadent..it also came with a sweet sauce with diced cumcumber that made it taste even better. The fresh rolls were good lots of fresh ingredients but to me they lacked flavor. The brown sauce that accompanied the rolls was delicious so it helped with the flavor aspect. For lunch we ordered the pad thai and red curry at a spicy level of 6. I had tofu while he ordered chicken. The tofu was perfectly fried and the dish looked and smelled great..when I ate it, again the flavor didn't pop out at me but it was good enough. I believe the spicy was took away from the flavor of my dish. My mistake there. The red curry on the other hand was very good beat I've had before...very flavorful like it came straight from thailand. The spicyness made it even better. We washed down out food with two mango juices which were smooth and not watery like the concentrated stuff..  Our bill ended up being $44 after tip and an extra order of samosa, a lil expensive for lunch but I would return again...plus it's BYOB!!",

    "text": "A couple of friends and I decided to check it out on a snowy Sunday night in January. None of us are familiar with the Highland Park area, and it took us a couple of trips up and down the street before we found the location... and this was with our GPS. Maybe we're just navigationally challenged, or perhaps they need a better awning or sign or giant flashing arrow indicating their location.  We didn't have a reservation but were lucky enough to be seated immediately. It doesn't look like it from the outside, but this place is very tiny, in a could-you-please-shift-your-table-so-I-can-get-into-my-seat-and-not-move-another-inch kind of way. It was moderately crowded when we arrived and only got busier as the night went on, so I would definitely suggest calling ahead for a reservation during dinner. The service was awesome: attentive staff and very efficient in terms of ordering and getting food out of the kitchen.  As I usually do when I check out a new Thai restaurant, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai at a moderately spicy level. The sauce the noodles were dressed in was very flavorful, but the entree as a whole didn't live up to all the hype and my expectations. The curries and other noodle dishes my friends ordered all looked delicious and they had nothing but good things to say. Thus I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying something new next time.",

The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. The fresh rolls are delicious-my favorite starter. The red curry is my favorite. I also love the pad kee mao, which is loaded with basil. However, their spice scale is no joke, so consider that if you attempt you go hotter than a \"5.\"  They are usually very quick with takeout, which is great. I live about 10 minutes away, and if I call before I leave, it's always ready when I get there. Like I said, excellent service!

For my dinner I decided upon having the chicken red curry at a level 10 spice while my dining companion had the chicken pad Thai.  There was an ample amount of food as I got a large portion of curry as well as a big side of rice.  The food itself was really good, better than most Thai that I have had in Pittsburgh.  My curry was spicy but not overly so and had a good mixture of all of the ingredients inside of it.  My dining companion also commented that she really enjoyed the Pad Thai.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely eat here again.  The food was good and I would like to actually sit in the restaurant and eat as it is a BYOB.

    "text": "I guess I will join the dozens of other Yelpers who love Smiling Banana Leaf. I've eaten at at least 5 other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this is the one to which I keep returning. It helps that it is quite close to my apartment, but even when I lived across town, I still visited frequently. After 2 years in Pittsburgh, I am comfortable calling this my favorite restaurant. I love how cozy the restaurant is and how it is one of the few BYOB restaurants I have found here that does not have a corkage fee.   I have sampled several menu items - all of the noodles (except Pad Thai... peanuts and I do not agree) and several of the curries. My hands down favorite is the Pad See Ew, preceded by the samosas appetizer.   When my parents visited Pittsburgh, I took them to Smiling Banana Leaf, despite the fact that my father absolutely hates Thai food. He absolutely loved the Pad See Ew and told me days later, on the phone: \"I was just thinking about that Thai restaurant we went to and how good it was.\"   I've had Pad See Ew at every other Thai restaurant I have visited, and Smiling Banana Leaf is the best place to get it. It's delicious.   So why 4 stars? Well, when the curries are good, they're really good, but I have occasionally found them to be a bit watery for my taste. Plus I tend to sweat and cry even on level 2 spiciness. The brown rice though, is made of many different colors of brown rice and is delicious. Also, my boyfriend and I have had some takeout troubles - once the woman at the desk forgot to give our order to the kitchen and the other time, the kitchen forgot to put chicken in my Pad See Ew. Service is always great when we eat in the restaurant though!",

On multiple occasions I've had horrendous 30+ minute waits for takeout food despite arriving after the time they've listed on the phone.  One time, my girlfriend was ignored by the staff for ten minutes only to annoyingly find out that our food had been sitting on the counter (getting cold) the entire time.  Most recently, after another thirty minute wait despite arriving after their estimate, we finally got our food and went home only to realize that half of the order was completely incorrect.  Waiting over an hour for incorrect food is completely unacceptable.  I will never be returning to this place due to their terrible service.",

You can get a pretty good Thai iced tea though if you're not into alcohol.   The food is reliably good and the portions are fair for the prices. I've always had a pleasant experience dealing with the folks who work here as well. If I had lived in Highland Park I would have eaten here all the time.",

Takeout here is great as well, they give huge portions for both dine in and take out, which not every place is consistent with. When I come here I always get the Khao Soi, it's a traditional Burmese noodle soup. It's rare to see that dish on menus and still be authentic. I've had this fish cooked by a Burmese family, so I think I'm a good judge. This dish also tastes best when dining in, it's still good for takeout, but better when staying. It's fresher and warmer when you dine in! This place is also BYOB with no corking fee! Also their Thai Coffee and Teas are great! Also, if you get the Khao Soi, get some rice on the side because it goes well with that too!",

I checked out the website and was pleased to see that I could make a reservation since I heard how small the place is. When we arrived, we were seated right away. I ordered a Thai Iced Tea, and the garlic stir fry with vegetables. I also ordered green curry noodles to go for my fiance. My friend ordered a noodle soup with chicken. My tea came out quickly and it was delicious! Not too sweet, just now I like it. The waitress then brought out our entrees and as soon as she set it down, I could tell this wasn't the correct order. We both had the exact same noodle dish with tofu (which neither of us ordered). We had the plates in front of us for about 5 minutes... we weren't able to flag anyone down. Once we were able to find our waitress, we told her these were the wrong entrees. She took them to the kitchen and brought out our correct entrees a few minutes later. My garlic stir fry was okay. Definitely a great garlic flavor, but the dish was mainly cabbage and onions.. with hardly any other vegetables. It was kind of disappointing and I wouldn't order that dish again.   Lastly after they brought our checks, the waitress never brought over my to-go order. After we paid, we waited and waited and never brought the order over.  When we were leaving, I went up to the front and asked the waitress about my order. She looked around until she found it sitting on the desk where the register is.   Overall, I felt like service was just okay. The place is tiny and it was not even filled up, so there weren't many customers in the restaurant. The food was just okay also. I may try it again in the future, but I'm in no rush to do so.",

    "text": "Pretty good food and portion sizes. I came here early on a Friday evening with no reservation and was seated immediately. After hopping off the bus, I noticed that the restaurant seemed small and inconspicuous, so I was a bit skeptical about the place. However I had heard good things from my friends, so we proceeded on our food adventure. We decided to order a Thai iced tea (only $2!!), the tofu paradise, and green chicken curry at spice level 3. The spice levels are only from 2-10, so we knew that the spice here would be no joke.  Our food arrived within 10 minutes. And oh man, it was good. The tofu paradise was an appetizer with fried tofu on a bed of shredded cabbage and vegetables covered in sweet peanut sauce. We were trying to decide between the two tofu appetizers and concluded on this one thanks to the suggestion of the waitress. It was sweet, crunchy, and definitely satisfactory. The curry, as predicted, had quite a kick to it. Personally I couldn't handle the spice, as I can't really handle any spice. Fortunately my friend was able to finish the curry no problem.  The food here is fantastic. My only complaints are regarding the service. We were seated at the table furthest from the counter and closest to the bathroom. After the waitress took our order and delivered our food, she did not check up on us at all. We had to ask a different server to bring us chopsticks and refill our water. At the end, we went up to the counter to pay as the waitress seemed to be too busy to bring us our check. Oh well, gave us a chance to stretch our legs!   I will be coming back for their lunch specials. It's definitely worth it for the fare!",

The Pad Thai has the perfect balance of sweet, tangy and spicy. The appetizers were also great. The main issue is that the green curry is very spicy at spicy level 5 ... I liked the pumpkin curry more, but again, I would order a very low number (like a 1 or 2). I will say, also, that they did not do anything special for my boyfriends birthday... I think they could have at least provided him a free desert, especially considering the amount of food we ordered. Overall, it is a great restaurant and I would definitely consider going again, I would just remember to order a very low number next time. ;)",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. Heard great reviews about the place and was excited to come here. First impression of the location was that it was small and not wellkept, but I've had good food at many hole in the wall places so I gave it a shot. Ordered crispy taro spring rolls and chicken satay to start. The rolls had barely any filler, and the sauce was very bland. The chicken itself was okay but the peanut and cucumber sauces were very sweet and not at all what you expect from Thai food. We ordered pad Thai and pad see ew, both with tofu. The pad Thai wasn't bad, a little on the sweet side but overall bland. The pad see ew was way to sweet, and also bland. Overall, the food was bland and disappointing. The service was also disappointing. There was only one server for 8 tables, and the guy at the register didn't acknowledge us. The server, after taking orders, would disappear and only talk to tables that were ordering or getting food. I would personally rate noodlehead above this place, and noodlehead is at three stars. If you're looking for authentic, or even halfway decent thai food, I would not come here.",

Everything from appetizers to our meals was spot on! Peanut sauce is on the sweeter side but had great texture and salty savory flavors as well. They paired well with extra crispy fried tofu, and grilled chicken skewers (maybe a hint of lemongrass?). I also ordered pumpkin curry, which was very flavorful. - no corkage fee for byob! -service was fairly quick, which was also a bit of a drawback - outdoor seating would make an amazing atmosphere a summer night meal  Things I didn't like: -a little crowded because the restaurant is relatively small - I felt that the server taking our orders was a bit curt with us, perhaps a busy night? But overall service was pretty good (and the food was even better!)",

There is an ice cream store right down the block which had a lot of kids outside so if that's not your thing then I would eat inside. There's no guarantee that the ice cream place would be popping, but yeah if you don't like rowdy kids then I would eat inside (in the summer). However, I actually liked that aspect! It felt very summery and fun to be outside where kids were eating ice cream, and me thai food haha. I believe I had the thai fried rice like I always get and it was super great. Definitely one of my top 3 thai places in Pittsburgh that I have been to. The wait staff was very accommodating when it rained which was very nice. We also got the spring rolls which were pretty good. Definitely would recommend.",

I completely understand the issue of being late and I apologies; however, the lady was not nice. The waitress was nice, but she was not very attentive. The food took a long time to come out and items were forgotten. When we got our check, the owner threw the check at us, told us she wouldn't split it, and already added gratuity for our table of 5. I don't mind restaurants that have these policies, but (1) I don't think this restaurant had the policy and I just think the lady was being rude (2) they should be up front with the policy if the policy exists. The food isn't worth poor service and I can get better food elsewhere. Plus, the restaurant is tiny and crowded.",

The curry was also great, the rice helped the heat situation...and I had a little of my friends Pad Thai (a staple when you're going out for Thai food), which was also very tasty.

I had the som tum and chicken panang curry and both were excellent. I don't remember what the other 5 of my family ordered but everyone enjoyed everything they ate. I ordered 2 stars based off many reviews and found that it wasn't spicy enough. I'm usually not a fan of really spicy food in the Thai category so I'm surprised my review isn't of the same opinion of others. Usually Medium is my max and at some places it's to much. However I wish I would of went 3 or maybe 4 start here on the spice. 2 was very mild to little heat.  The place was very small, seating for 22 so make a reservation and the place was full by 6:30-7:00.  Service was great and everything went smoothly. they were very friendly to my 6 & 4 year old and they didn't mine kids.",

    "text": "Yes, yes, yessss.. Super fresh Thai food with some great spice/heat to boot. (If you want it)  As described to me by the server, the noodles are made fresh daily - and they sure tasted like it, with a freshly cooked crunch to them. I also really enjoyed the 1-10 heat options. I went a bit out of my comfort zone -- of just adding Sriracha to Pad Thai -- and went with their 8. I had enough heat to need a water at hand, but I wasn't dying. It was also a fresh spice that I haven't really ever experienced in my Thai food.  Excited to come back to this hidden gem in the future. Particularly enjoyed sitting outside and found it to be really relaxing, even with the buses that were coming by pretty frequently.  Restaurant was also BYOB!",

In addition they had outside seating which I appreciated.  Ordered the mango salad to start with. This was my favorite dish and I would highly recommend it. I really enjoyed the salad dressing in addition to the mangos. Great mix and very refreshing.   I got the massaman curry spicy level 3. I thought it was good but nothing to rave about. The flavor of the curry was a bit bland and the rice that came with it was dry.   The service was great and everyone was very friendly. If I'm back in this neighborhood I would probably stop by again but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.",

    "text": "Revelation #1: I really, really love Thai food Revelation #2: I don't try nearly as many Thai restaurants as I should  The Smiling Banana Leaf offers an extensive menu with a variety of options to suit just about anyone - vegetarians and carnivores alike! For my first visit here (certainly not my last), we sat at one of the many outdoor tables and started with an order of the fresh tofu spring rolls.  These were served with an awesome dipping sauce that I can only describe as duck sauce meets honey.  Soooo good!  I love making spring rolls at home so they're always a must-get when I see them on a menu.  Next up were our entrees - the green curry with chicken for my SO, spice level 7, and the dry noodles with chicken for yours truly, spice level 2 (judge me). My generous portion of noodles were just a tad spicy, and very flavorful.  The chicken was cooked well and not dry, and I loved the amount of bean sprouts piled on top!  I was happy with my dish and would likely order this again, but the green curry with rice was the real star here.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've had curry, but that number is about to skyrocket.  There was so much flavor packed into one bowl and while I was hesitant about the spice level, it actually played perfectly with the cool coconut milk.  Just enough heat to hit you on the front of the palette, say hello, and then vanish until the next bite.  Between the green curry and my dish, I think the green curry noodles might be the perfect combination on my next visit.  Reasonably priced, including lunch portions, delicious food, and in a lovely location... I can see why the banana leaf is smiling!",

    "text": "Consistency.  My very first visit here was a long, long time ago and it definitely was not a good first impression.  The spice level I ordered, 6 or so out of 10 gave me the biggest heartburn!  Fast forward over to this year, the interest rekindled when I noticed it was across from another new restaurant I was trying for the first time, Cafe de Brazil.    So this time around I decided to go low on the apice level to test the 2-4 levels.  Much more bearable; at times the 3 level had enough spice whereas I could still taste the food, feel the heat I desired and enjoy the flavors.   My usual is:    Crispy Fried Pork Spring Roll-crispy as it says and great starter with a sweet dip sauce. Let it cool a bit first before you eat though as they are fried right before they take it out to you!  Tom Som - Papaya salad with choice of a meat for an additional charge.  Typically I add shrimp to it.  The salad always tastes fresh and crisp.  The sauce they use it also the reason why it is so good.  Mango Tilapia - I normally request the sauce and mango separate from the fish for the majn reason I like my fish to remain crispy and not drenched in sauce and become soggy.   I use the side sauce as well as sauce from the Tom Som to dip my fish!  The kee maw noodles are excellent!  Perfectly cooked each time and the seasoning just seems to be spot-on each time.   I now recommend Smiling Banana for great tasting Thai.",

I took her recommendation on the koy soy and it was the best curry noodles I've ever had.  First time having that and I'm glad I tried it. My son ordered the spicy noodle Tom yum (he's 14 and wanted to try something he's never had so I was proud) although he wasn't a fan of the mushroom and the broth flavor, he still enjoyed the steamed pork buns and the pad Thai that my 6yr old daughter had. She loves that dish so I knew it was a safe option for her. We all ordered the lunch size and it was enough for two meals! So we ended up taking everything home and having lunch the next day. Also the prices were amazing!  We are from Buffalo NY and the Thai restaurant selection is slim pickings. If we are ever in Pittsburgh again I will be sure to stop by again!",

We split an order of the crispy taro spring rolls and they came out immediately. Our food came out quickly after. I ordered the Koy Soy curry noodles and they were delicious. The portion size was huge. I had an entire meal left over to take home, and the lunch portion was only $9. I asked for spicy level 5 and it was perfect for me. Spicy without being too overpowering. My friend ordered the basil dish with tofu and eggplant, which was also fantastic. Servers were extremely attentive. I drink a lot of water, and they refilled my water continually! I don't think I ever finished the entire glass. I would definitely return. Only thing stopping me from coming back here all the time is the distance!",

The space is light, and open which creates a good dining experience. Along the far wall there is bench seating perfect for group outings. The staff was very attentive to the appetizers/ main courses.  The curry was to die for. I typically get the highest spice level, and this time was no exception. Usually I'm not phased, but this time I think a met my match with the spicy Massaman. I could barely handle the 10 out of 10 spice level, and I enjoyed every second of it.   If you like spicy good then this is the place for you. (My partner did enjoy the mild curry).",

They said that the ordered just popped up on their screen as 'red curry', so they made standard red curry. They claim this is postmates fault but that's how it appears on the restaurant's menu??? Postmates clearly differentiates between red curry rice and noodles on their menu so I don't believe it was their fault.

    "text": "Smiling Banana Leaf can best be described as a cute little Thai place serving up fantastic food in an adorable neighborhood. It could also be described as the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  The food comes promptly, is served hot, and tastes great. The red curry is among the best I've had, with strong aromatic tones of lemongrass, thai lime and coconut. There's also a great spice level and decent amounts of meat. The mango sticky rice is great as well, as are the spring rolls.",

She gave us background information on the owners and the chef and told us the #1 rule is: don't ask the cook for her curry recipes.   That being said, the curries were amazing. The green papaya salad was phenomenal and the desert was the perfect finish.   We both really like spicy food and ordered a 6/10 for everything. We possibly could have gone a little spicier, but a 6 provided a little heat with every bite.  Street parking available near the restaurant. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Smiling Banana Leaf has definitely got my attention.  What  a yummy lunch.  We came on a Saturday probably close to 12:30.  We were warned to make reservations since the place is cozy, but we were fairly early for our suspected arrival and were seated near a window at a two top.  I read since the restaurant was tight that on cold days every time the door opened you would get a winter blast.  Lucky for us we must have been seated perfectly since as cold as it was outside we stayed comfy inside.  Our waitress was very cheery.  There was a lady refilling water glasses consistently so no threat of wanting for water.  We started with the fresh summer roll of the day as an appetizer.  We no sooner ordered than the waitress delivered the rolls to us.  At this point we placed our entree orders and began to enjoy the rolls.  The rolls, which usually is one of the highlights of my dining options, were very mediocre.  There was shrimp in them yet neither me or my husband detected the shrimp.  I was also missing all those wonderful mint and basil flavors that are usually packed into the rolls.  I found them to be quite bland.  The Thai hot paste I requested did enhance the flavor but they were still pretty meh.  Our entrees came out a short time later.  When we eat Thai I never know how hot to order the dishes.  Some places have scales between 1-5, others 1-10, here is 1-10.  I asked the waitress for a suggestion, she asked how hot I like it.  Oh I like it hot!  But I also like to taste my food.  I have been to Thai places where a four will send your taste buds packing so you just never know.  With this information she suggested a 7.  I was hesitant but then again she is the expert.  I asked for more Thai chili paste and red pepper flakes just in case.  I went with the Pad Kee Mao with Tofu, because I just love those fat rice noodles.  Our dishes were served and they looked amazing.  The portion was excellent.  The noodles were prepared perfectly, not too soft or gummy.  They served an ample amount of tofu which is awesome.  Many places skimp on the proteins but not here.  The meal was perfect, save one thing.  A 7 was WAAAYYY too mild.  I dowsed my dish with pepper flakes and paste to drive up the Scoville units.  Other than the lack of spice the flavor was well balanced.  With my few adjustments I was able to create a delicious meal with plenty of leftovers for another meal.  We love a few places on Bryant it's awesome to have another great stop on this street.",

The pineapple pieces were fresh and juicy. I highly recommend this place. Authentic and pleasant outdoor seating. And budget friendly!",

    "text": "My wife and I have been making our way to different Thai restaurants in the Burgh and we were very impressed with The Smiling Banana Leaf.  First of all it is on one of our favorite streets in the city because of Park Bruges.  Smiling Banana gives us another reason to visit Bryant Street.   Parking was easy here.  We found street parking just a street over.  Walking in you can see that they have outside seating for the warmer months.  That helps because the inside is small but it isn't as small as we were thinking.  I did call ahead for reservations for two at 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  They sat us next to a window at a two seater. It is small in there but we didn't think it was too small even if it was full we wouldn't feel that cramped.   We were hungry so we ordered some Spring Rolls right away.  We received rolls probably with in three or four minutes of when we placed the order.  Carrie asked for them to whip up a special hot sauce paste for her and they did.  The rolls were ok.  We felt they tasted a little plain and we didn't taste hardly in shrimp in it.  The nut sauce and the hot paste they made helped it a lot.  It was a good roll but we have tasted better.   Next we ordered our main dish.  Carrie got the Pad Kee Mao with TOFU and I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken.  Our food came out probably a little over ten minutes after we ordered.  It looked, smelled, and tasted great.  We both loved our meals.  For the price we feel we received more food than the other Thai restaurants that we have been to and they gave us a lot of meat (Chicken and Tofu).  We couldn't finish our food and it made great left overs later on for us.  Spice wise I asked for a 6 and my wife asked for a 7.  We both probably could have bumped it up a few ticks but still it was really good.     So this is now one of our favorite Thai restaurants in the Burgh.  I think it's the best for the price and the amount of food you get but it is right up there in food quality as well.  The Spring Rolls were a little disappointing but we will be back.  This is a 4.5 stars for me.",

They have been replaced with a darker colors of hardwood floors and wooden tables. It is not the Smiling Banana Leaf that I remember for its beautiful interior. I ordered pad kee mow on a 8/10 spicy scale but found it to not be very spicy at all. The noodles were also clumped together a lot. So unfortunately, it has changed and I'm hoping that other dishes will be better tasting with fresh flavors and spices but time will tell, as I'm a bit leary to come back. Also, they no longer have lunch specials on Saturdays...not sure about the rest of the week.",

We were ok with that, but less than five minutes later a white couple came in, said they didn't have reservations and got a seat that was not next to the door and the freezing weather. The white couple also got served before us. Unfortunately we'll be looking for a new Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, which isn't the easiest thing in the world.",

Otherwise, I love this restaurant. It's my go-to takeout place since it's so close to home. And the food is pretty good.

My Pad Thai was good, but oh so small.  I think I received the lunch portion.  I didn't specify, so it was my bad.  But I gobbled my dish up in about 5.5 seconds and I wanted more because it was so good!  The shrimp was plump and the sauce was sweet, just how I like it.  Maybe it's my big American appetite, but I definitely left hungry.  Just a little taste of magic!  Very good Pad Thai, yes.  But here's the thing...

I've had Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Rad Na, all of which were great.  They tasted even better than I expected them to and the level of spice was as I asked for.  If you come during lunch time, the prices can't be beat.  The lunch portions are enough to fill me up and it costs less than $10!  Also, the Thai Iced Tea is always a great addition to the meal.  All their desserts are also super yummy. I've had them all but the sweet mango with sticky rice usually wins for me.  The mango with the rice is a great finisher to the meal.  Fried Smiling Banana is also something I'd definitely say to try if you've never tried it before.",

We have eaten here once or twice a month since moving, and it never disappoints!  The restaurant space itself is small, but we are usually able to find a seat (we have yet to go on a weekend, so it might be different then!). The staff are friendly and attentive. When they found out about my allergies to fish, they made sure to assist me with locating items on the menu that were safe for me, and constantly checked with the kitchen to ensure that my meal was cooked correctly. We typically start with their Fresh Roll of the Day, which is a large order of fresh rolls with either tofu or some fish product. The dipping sauce is good, but not as tasty as Nicky's Thai Kitchen's peanut dipping sauce. The past few times I have orderedI the Tofu Eggplant dish- I usually substitute chicken for the tofu, which they are happy to do. The sauce is excellent, and the eggplant is perfectly cooked. The portions are generous, so there are always leftovers for the next day! My husband loves their Green Curry Noodles, enjoying the spicy green curry sauce with chicken and veggies.   The restaurant is BYOB, so it is a nice, inexpensive place for a night out, and a little more relaxed than Pusadee's Garden, which is right down the hill in Lawrenceville. I highly recommend Smiling Banana Leaf for a great Thai meal!",

I'm willing to bet it was more the tiny kitchen than the serving staff (who were super nice). There seemed to be a ton of take out orders so maybe they have to make tough decisions. Whatever the Thai equivalent of those Sesame Inn crunchy noodles might not be the worst idea to tide people over. I also feel immeasurable pity for anyone who has to use the restroom here, as literally every single person in the restaurant will watch you walk in and walk out.

Not exactly what I would expect from a Thai restaurant, but as soon as the food comes out, you know you're in good hands. My favorite dishes here are any of the curries except the pumpkin (too sweet for my palette) and the Pad Kee Mao. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the Pad Thai, but perhaps you'll have better luck. The Satay Chicken is wonderful, and the sauces it comes with are especially good.   Pittsburgh has a surprising amount of Thai restaurants but I find myself coming back here time and time again, for good reason. The food is good, the prices are reasonable, the waitstaff is polite, and the ambiance is great. All I can ask for",

    "text": "Smiling Banana Leaf is one of our favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh, and if Highland Park didn't \"seem so far out of the way\" (you know how it is to leave your part of the city, even when something is only a few miles away), my wife and I would be there way too often.  My only complaint is that the Smiling Banana Leaf sort of defines the line between being a cozy, intimate restaurant, and being simply TOO SMALL. Every time that I've gone, we've had reservations or picked up take out, but you still end up standing for a few minutes, packed uncomfortably in the opening of the restaurant or standing outside, while your table is prepared. Once at your table, you still feel the almost-claustrophobic size of the restaurant, but it's easy to adjust to due to the brighter lighting that takes the setting from a potentially intimate dinner to a more casual one.  Most of the hesitations go out the door, though, once you get your food. The food is excellent, and incredibly affordable. Your portions aren't likely to be as large as some other Thai restaurants in the city, but the price is perfect, and really, so are the portions...unless you're looking for a gluttonous evening.  The curries are tasty and the pad thai is my favorite in the city. My favorite Thai dish right now is actually the pad kee mow/spicy noodle from the Banana Leaf. Their wide rice noodles create a different texture than other similar dishes that I've had, and really sets it apart.  I'd say definitely make a reservation if you're going to dine in, as there are only about 8 or so tables. Otherwise, grab take out, because it's definitely one of the best Thai spots in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Samosas!  Ah, I finally made it to Smiling Banana Leaf!  Being the fine purveyor of all things curry and Pad Thai, I was excited to finally grub down at this corner bound spot in Highland Park.  Here's what lived up to the hype (no need to rehash the details already covered):  1.  The Samosas 2.  The curries (particularly the red)  Here's what left a bit to be desired:  1.  The Pad Thai 2.  The curries (particularly the natural)  So what's that mean?  Smiling Banana Leaf is definitely a good spot, but would I say it's the best Thai in Pittsburgh...  no.  It has some great dishes it hits out of the park, yet it has others which don't particularly have a lot of flavor.  Do yourself a favor and just do a little research prior to going.  As for the space itself, this place is small.  I'd say reservations are a must on the weekend and make sure you bring a light jacket (at least for where I was sitting, the vent above me insisted on blowing cold air ... in December).  The staff were courteous as well (although not particularly helpful in offering recommendations).",

The restaurant is small and cozy, but modern after the refresh with almost an industrial homey feel.  I've had many things here, but my favorites remain the Pad See Ew, Pumpkin Curry, Red Curry Noodles, and Pineapple Curry. Everything is always very flavorful and steaming hot when it comes out. I've never had a bad meal here and always recommend it to friends when they are deciding on where to go.  On top of delicious food, the service is very good and food comes out really quickly. They started taking reservations, and I'd definitely recommend calling ahead.",

When this came up it sounded like a good idea, but it took us a minute to find it even though we were standing right across the street! The signage is a little odd and not next to the entrance.  We got in, and it was a very small, cute place, with furniture/decor that we instantly recognized as Ikea =). We shared some chicken satay appetizers, and I had Pad Kee Mow and I think he may have had the Rad Na. Everything was delicious! Service was good. Nicely priced lunch specials. No complaints =)  The one thing I guess is that it's really small, so don't plan any large parties here. There was also a little outdoor seating, but it was way too hot out the day we went for that.",

They took about 25 minutes to fix the meal, which I guess isn't too bad.  We got the Moo Yang, the ginger with beef, and the green curry with tofu and vegetable.   My favorite was the green curry. It created a warm fuzzy feeling in my stomach, though I think for the price, they were a bit stingy with the tofu/veggies? The Moo Yang (pork with some salad) was good but a bit too salty for me.  I wasn't a fan of the Ginger, but maybe it just wasn't complementary with the rest of the meal.",

    "text": "What a cute place!  We would never have come here if not for the Yelp reviews, so good job on that one, yelpers!  I'm not sure what they do in the winter, because this place is TINY.  The amount of outdoor seating is equivalent to the amount of indoor seating (which is probably somewhere around 10 people per space), so make reservations if you know you're going.  The service is fantastic - they are SO friendly!  It feels like a real neighborhood restaurant, which it is - totally tucked around the corner off Negley.  Some of the food was good, and some could have been better.  We started with the crispy calamari and steamed dumplings, both of which were fine.  I think we wished that there was a little more calamari than there was.  We then shared the pumpkin curry, pad see ew, and green curry.  Hands down, the pad see ew was the best we'd had in Pittsburgh, definitely on par with Green Mango, and potentially even better.  However, the consensus around the table was that the curry dishes were not as good as those at Green Mango - they seemed a little on the watery side.  Perhaps not enough coconut milk (some of them specifically that they are not made with coconut milk, so there's that).  Mainly, they just didn't seem as... \"taste\"y as others we'd had before.  Also, the pumpkin was a touch undercooked and was tough.  But we loved the fresh mango with sweet sticky rice dessert, perhaps even more than the fried banana dessert with ice cream.  This is all to say, we're happy to have found another good thai place in town, and the service is just so cute that we'll have to keep on going back.",

As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is tiny, but I didn't feel too cramped.  Our server was very nice and friendly and the food arrived very promptly.  They were out of Thai iced teas, but we ordered Thai samosas ($4.50 for 4), a massaman curry minus the peanuts ($9.50), a Coke ($1.50), and a chicken pad thai ($8.50).  The Thai samosas are delicious - the filling is creamy and the cucumber sauce is great.  The massaman curry was pretty good.  I thought the rice-curry ratio was good, and there were good chunks of potato and tofu, plus peas and carrots.  I thought it could have used a touch more flavor.  The pad thai wasn't bad but wasn't the best.  We ordered it with a spice level of 8, which seemed pretty accurate.  We didn't order desserts but they were $5.  They offered fried bananas, a taro custard, and two other which I can't remember.  Our total was $25.  We are both eager to come back and try some more dishes on their menu.  BYOB.",

Don't really care, because it's adorable.  I also appreciate that it is possible for me to order something so spicy I can hardly stand it. I love spicy, but the most I can get here is a 7. If you're part asbestos, go for an 8. If you're suicidal, get a 10.   The only negative comment I have is that because the place is so small, you can sometimes feel as though you're eating with the people at another table. Usually, this isn't a big deal, but on one occasion a family's three ill-behaved children all but ruined our night.

The restaurant itself is very small, probably no more than 12' x 20', and is somewhat hidden away, but the service is superb--punctual yet not obtrusive--and the ambiance delightful.  It's low lit, but not irritatingly so, and the only real complaint I have is that the tables are a bit close together due to it's small size, making it ideal for a fun night out with friends as opposed to a private and quiet gathering.  And given the limited seating you'll definitely want reservations.  We started out with the fresh rolls, the best I've ever had, and followed up with entrees of pad thai, pineapple chicken fried rice, cashew pork and pumpkin chicken curry.  The presentation was beautiful but it should be noted that the entrees come as individual servings, not necessarily for sharing as is common to some Thai restaurants, so it's a good idea to order perhaps one or two more things on the menu if you plan to share amongst yourselves, as we did.  The pad thai was not at all greasy, a first for me, and all ingredients used were fresh and high quality.  Surprisingly, my very favorite was the pineapple fried rice.  I'm not sure what spices were used but it was phenomenal and unique.    My conclusion is that you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I'll definitely be a repeat customer and can't wait to try out more of their exceptional food.",

We orderedtwo appetizers:  the chicken satay and fried spring rolls.  The satay was excellent.  It appeared to have an egg coating, and was very moist.  The peanut and cucumber sauces were both very good.  The spring rolls were a little too doughy and did not have a lot of chicken in them.  I would have preferred the shrimp or veggie; but sometimes you have to compromise with the rest of the family.    For dinner I had the Spicy Noodle Tom Yum Soup (spice level 5) with shrimp and veggies.  Sweet and spicy with rice noodles done right. I would have preferred more noodles than what was included.  The shrimp were so so.  I am getting tired of the small imported farm-raised shrimp as they ususally don't have much flavor.  Lots of fresh veggies.    My wife had the pad thai noodles with chicken, which she enjoyed.  I tasted it and the peanut sauce was really flavorful.  My boys both got chicken dishes, which were both very good, as well.    The place is BYOB and the restaurant provided us with nice wine glasses.  I don't they even charged us a corckage fee.    The place was hopping by the time we left.  There were two staff serving food and taking orders; they were very helpful is helping us decide what to get, and they managed to heep up with the tables despite how busy they were.  I will definitely come here again to try some new dishes.",

    "text": "After having gone here four, maybe five times, I'm FINALLY writing a review.  I like this place a lot.  Their pumpkin curry is really really tasty (has chunks of pumpkin in it though so beware if you just want pumpkin flavor), and I've had their red and green curries as well.  I've tried bites of the spicy green bean and the pad thai, and I've enjoyed those.  Portions are generous--their lunch portion is what I'd eat for dinner and I've never finished their dinners--but prices are reasonable, less than $10 for lunch and less than $15 for dinner.  Service is always very attentive, but the place can get a bit loud during peak dinner.  Contrary to other Yelpers, I'm quite happy with the spice level--I've ordered a 7 every time and it's been consistently at the pleasant mouth heat level that I love.  I've tried my dining companions' 3s and 5s and they've been significantly less spicy, so I do think there is True variation there.  I've never made a reservation here, but I always try to go at the beginning or end of typical dinner times (i.e. 5pm or 8pm) and I've been fine.  I did try to go with a group of 5 around 7pm a week or two ago and we wouldn't have been able to be seated until 8:30, so we went elsewhere.  If all else fails, they do do takeaway, so you can get your curry fix without waiting for a table.  Also, BYOB--yay!  They do accept credit cards but twice when I've been there the machine has been broken so bring some cash just in case.  There's a small parking lot off the street, and parallel parking on Bryant St. as well.  The 71B goes right by here too.  GO!  Your mouth and wallet will thank you :-)",

We ordered the green curry, mine with tofu and a spice level of 6, and his with chicken at a spice level of 0. The curry was watery without much flavor, but with a good spice kick. Weirdly, my order did not have green beans whereas my friend's did. His \" spicy level 0\" curry had visible spices floating in it and had a slight kick... not sure if this is a miscommunication issue or if they have a baseline spicyness.  Overall, I would not recommend this place. Maybe we went at an especially busy time (Sunday 730pm on labor day weekend), but I plan on going to Pusadee in the future.",

    "text": "Note: MAKE A RESERVATION, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GOING IN THE EVENING!  Kay had been wanting to come here for some time now. Deciding to deprive either of us no longer, we headed to the Smiling Banana Leaf Friday night.   Yes, the seating is at a premium, and yes, it is small, hidden in Highland Park, a neighborhood I hadn't visited in decades. So by all means, make a reservation. They're even thoughtful enough to allow you to order up while you're waiting for a table so that your meal arrives promptly after being seated, steaming hot I might add.   Our plate of Thai Samosa came, and we were off!  What you get is a quartet of fried wonton-type triangles that are filled with potatoes, carrot, and green peas. What was surprising to me was that each one was sweet enough to be a dessert. The four wedges also came with a clear, syrupy dipping sauce that had chunks of cucumber in it, making a good starter even better.  Our second appetizer was a bowl of their take on Wonton Soup, which Kay and I shared. I ate all the mushrooms since they aren't one of Kay's favorite things. You get two wontons of pork and shrimp in each bowl with baby corn, carrots, and spinach leaves taking a bath along with them. This was a total contrast to the rather bare Chinese Wonton Soup I am used to. The broth was hearty as were the soft, bulbous wontons. The veggies didn't need to be there but were far from unwelcome.  I really had no clue as to what I order other than that I knew I wanted something that was quinessentially Thai. Enter the dish known as Pad Thai. Upon reading about Pad Thai, I am disheartened to discover that it was popularized and made into Thailand's national dish by a fascist Prime Minister. I am racked with guilt over enjoying it so much.   Peppery and sweet, this dish was too erotic to be served legally, and I am not exaggerating. The beautiful tangled mess of precisely cooked noodles obscured a treasure in the crispy, delicate Tilapia that I discovered pieces of throughout the Pad Thai. Each chunk was a flavor-packed prize, and sadness filled my being when I realized that I had eaten all of them. I ordered mine with seafood (you can also get beef or shrimp), so in addition to the Tilapia, my Pad Thai also entailed calamari, baby scallops, and shrimp.   Do Asian restaurants ever get seafood wrong? Each time I order a seafood dish at an Asian eatery, the seafood itself is always consummately cooked, and this was most definitely no exception.   Kay got a Yellow Curry with beef, and it reminded me of Mulligatawny in a favorable way.  Dessert for two came in the form of the Fried Smiling Banana with Ice Cream. Mashed banana was wrapped in a fantastic foursome of spring rolls, drizzled with caramel, served alongside a mound of a slightly tart, vaguely banana-laced vanilla ice cream, and made for a cool, refreshing, and tantalizing epilogue to our Thai meal.  And we weren't stuffed despite the generously-portioned entrees. Thai food seems to fill you up without making you feel 9 months pregnant.   The atmosphere is very chatty, noisy, and dare I say intellectual? Man, the conversations I overheard (someone was in the middle of doing important research and obviously wanted the entire room to hear of it). The clientele was highly diverse as well. As we walked in, we saw a group of Indian people laughing it up over wine. Our small table was flanked by a duo of Asian students (I tend to eavesdrop a tad) and a happy gay couple (one of them had recently been to the dentist. again with the eavesdropping...yeesh). You can't get that in every part of Pittsburgh.    Although it was packed and clamorous, we found SBL to be both romantic and warm. Speaking of warm, the staff was just that. We were greeted with smiles, sent on our way with smiles, and  were made to feel like longtime family friends. Before we walked out, we were asked how we liked our meal. When I proceeded to rave about how good it all was, I was thanked profusely like a judge giving a 10 to an aspiring dance troupe. The expressions on their faces was a reward even sweeter than our dessert.    Come to SBL and find yourself rewarded with exotic delicacies, expert preparation, reasonable prices, enthusiasm, and sheer graciousness.",

    "text": "After visiting Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I was expecting even more from the Smiling Banana Leaf, as per the reviews--but I was a little let down.   I'm not sure if my ordering was off, but I found a theme in sauces and dressings that were just too sweet.   We started with the spring roll, steamed dumplings and the calamari. The spring roll was quite good, steamed dumplings were very light and well seasoned and the calamari was good, but a bit overcooked. It was a little too chewy because of it, but it wasn't a bit greasy and the coating was perfect. However, the dipping sauce was extremely sweet and almost like jam. I preferred the dumpling dipping sauce for it.   The glass noodle salad was heavily, heavily dressed with a dressing that would have benefitted from  healthy does of acid and much less sweetness. However, the meat in the salad was generous and the shrimp in the salad was well cooked. The vegetables, specifically the onions, were rather huge pieces, while there seemed to be an under representation in the \"greens\" department. Honestly, by the time I finished my salad I couldn't really taste a whole lot because it was just SO sweet.   The pad thai, at a 7 level hotness, wasn't very hot. And again, it was pretty sweet. There weren't very many bean sprouts and the meat chunks were huge. The curried noodles, at a hotness of 5, had a delicious sauce, but the noodles were pretty overcooked.   It could be, we caught the restaurant on a off day, as it was a holiday weekend. It could be, I just ordered badly, as the neighboring diners food looked delicious. The ambiance is quite adorable and the service is good. I would give it another shot before declaring it a no-go zone.",

    "text": "I have to agree with Ran L. about the food here being just average for Thai.  I stopped by with a friend on Sat. evening to get take-out.  I ordered the pad see ew with shrimp (spice level: 4), and she ordered the ginger chicken (spice level: 3).  I'm not sure if they accidentally transposed the spice levels, but her food was so spicy it was inedible to both of us.  My food, on the other hand, had about the amount of spice that I like.  In addition to the shrimp, my pad see ew came with what appeared to be small pieces of chicken.  I was a bit surprised by the paucity of shrimp--but then again, I'm not super-familiar with this dish, so they could just be an add-on.  The flavor was okay, but didn't wow me.  The vegetables were well-cooked and not limp, which was nice.  The two dishes came with a side of rice, though it was unclear which dish it went with, which we ended up splitting.  Because of the inedibility of the ginger chicken, my friend and I ended up splitting the pad see ew--fortunately, there was enough to do that.  I should mention that my friend, who lives in Morningside, is a frequent customer of SBL, and has ordered the ginger chicken (in addition to other dishes) many times before.  As such, she was surprised at the inconsistency in the spice.  One level up shouldn't have been that much hotter!  I tried the ginger chicken and didn't care for the dish's flavor, so when my friend offered the rest of it to me, I declined.  I did take the rest of the pad see ew and finished it tonight, but was debating not doing so.  Ultimately, a combination of hunger and being out late got the best of me, though.  With so many other great Thai options in PGH (like Nicky's, my fav), I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, based on my experience and the extremely small seating area (it really is tiny!).",

A little sweet but nothing to rave about. Other patrons seemed to be enjoying their food so I guess I ordered the wrong dish. Service was fast, friendly and efficient. The owner/manager was very friendly and talked to everyone. I would probably get take-out or sit outside to eat as it gets very stuffy inside. Will give it another try.",

Not by the servers, but the place is so small that the people waiting kept poking their heads around the corner to see how much food I had left.   The food was delicious though. I ordered the Pad See Ew with beef and didn't realize it was an extra FOUR DOLLARS for beef!! I've seen it be the same price as chicken, or MAYBE an extra two dollars...but four dollars...DAMN! and there wasn't even that much of it. So I was kind of mad about that part.   Also got the tofu paradise and the pork spring rolls - both which were fantastic. Will definitely return, but probably to get take out as the place is way too small.",

    "text": "Since moving to Pittsburgh, I have heard that this was THE place to come for Thai food.  It is out of the way so it took until yesterday to finally try it after a visit to the zoo.  Thankfully we were early enough that there was no wait because the dining room is so tiny.  I think there may have been about five or six tables total.  Where we were seated was bench seating on one side and metal chairs on the other.  They each had cushions but weren't exactly comfortable.    The server seemed a bit frazzled which didn't make sense because there was only on other table that was occupied.  When we had questions on the menu, they weren't sure and had to keep coming back with the information.  That being said, they were willing to get the information and not be rude about it or write our questions off.  We started with a Thom Kha soup and peanut satay.  The soup was a hit.  A perfect blend of sweet coconut and spice.  It was LOADED with vegetables.  Almost too many for the fairly small bowl.  Friends wanted to order the fresh roll of the day but apparently they hadn't made them yet (even though it was after 5:00).  My husband ordered the pad kee mao and although he enjoyed it, said he has had much better elsewhere.  He had asked for a spice level of 9 and it was more like a 4 or a 5 which was disappointing to him.    I ordered the mango curry with tofu with a spice level of 5.  We wonder if they accidently switched the spice levels of our dishes because it had a crazy kick.  It was extremely tasty, though.  Our friends ordered entrees with brown rice and both came out with white rice.  When more rice was brought out, even though they both ordered the same rice, it was different.  Not sure why, but they both enjoyed it.  Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience here and would be back more often if it was closer to the areas that we tend to frequent.",

    "text": "Smiling Banana Leaf is a charming little Thai restaurant located in the heart of Highland Park. I ended up calling in for a reservation about an hour and a half before arriving on a Saturday evening, and when we arrived, we were seated right away. Even though the restaurant wasn't entirely full when we came in, my dad and I ended up waiting for about 10 minutes before the waiter came out with water and to get our orders in.  The food was excellent! I ordered the chicken yellow curry noodles with a spicy rating of 3. Firstly, I would like to admit that I am an absolute WUSS when it comes to my spiciness tolerance. So while most normal people would find a 3 on the bland side, I ended up drinking a few glasses of water and having to ask the waiter to fill up our pitcher of water again because of the spiciness. Nevertheless, I found the curry absolutely delicious and ate as much of it as I could!  My only gripe about this place is that since the restaurant is very small, the seating is a little bit crammed and the outer benches where some of the tables are situated are a little uncomfortable. Additionally, since the place is on the smaller side, it can fill up very quickly so I would definitely call ahead to make a reservation.  All in all, I had a wonderful time at Smiling Banana Leaf and would definitely recommend this place to my Thai food-loving friends!",

There is a quite unpleasant comrade at the front desk who was as gracious as road kill.  The interior went from sunny and bright to dull, white and as ingratiating as a gulag.  The food was still good and maintaining it's own.  The big finale came upon exiting, when we went to the cashier to have an item removed from the bill which we had neither ordered or eaten.  \"Boris\" asked, 'How do I know you didn't order it?' I simply stated that the server agreed with us and that it was a mistake.  He agreed with the logic and when I asked what the total of the bill was now, he simply held up a calculator to our faces.  Not a word or even a glance in our direction.  If your plans involve take out, I would say that you will have a wonderful experience.  Otherwise...",

    "text": "Food was honestly a 5/5 (delicious!) but the service was TERRIBLE! My friends and I went into the restaurant, and the hostess/waitress didn't even acknowledge us for the first five minutes. When she finally noticed us, it was because another couple came in after us, and she then seated our group along with the other couple who came in. However, for some reason, she served the other couple (who came in after us) first, bringing them water and taking their orders before doing ours. She then proceeded to take our orders, and rudely cut me off when I was ordering because I didn't tell her what spice level and protein I wanted in my pad thai before moving on the my other choices. There was also a dirty fork from the previous guest on my table setting area, but when I politely pointed it out, she didn't even apologize and just said, \"Oh, I'll replace that but I have no idea how that got there.\" She then asked me to HAND HER THE DIRTY FORK. I'm sorry, but I do not want to touch an oily, clearly dirty fork that someone else has eaten from, right before I dig in to my own meal. However, even at this point, we didn't say anything and I just handed her the fork and we waited for our food. When we finally got our food, my friend (who ordered a PORK pad thai) was handed a chicken pad thai. The same waitress asked us, \"who got the shrimp and who got the chicken pad thai?\" When we didn't respond immediately, she said to me, \"you got the shrimp I remember, that means he (my friend) got the chicken.\" My friend informs her that he actually ordered the pork, and she responded, \"really? let me go check the order.\" She comes back shortly, and then said \"yeah, you did order pork, but actually, that pad thai in front of you IS pork.\" CLEARLY, it looked like chicken and not pork. Granted, the poor lady looked really overworked was the only person answering the phones and serving all the tables at one point, BUT we still think it was unacceptable as customers and guests at a restaurant to have to deal with the rudeness and condescending attitude just because the employees are tired/overworked.  Like I said, the food is very good, but unless the service improves, I don't think we will be coming back!",

Smiling banana leaf's food belongs to the later category. There was nothing really memorable or special that set this meal apart... What a disappointment!  For our meal we ordered their famed chicken pad thai, the fried rice & the red chili shrimp. None really good. If I absolutely HAD TO pick one I would say it was the fried rice (what a sad state of affair!)  The place isn't large, just a hole in the wall. So don't you dare come in with a big group to enjoy the food here!

The dry noodles are satisfying, and the pad see eiw is better than most. Definitely grab an order of steamed dumplings.

A friend and I came in to eat last night around 9:15, and we weren't even greeted before a server told us we couldn't sit on the patio because they were closing soon. Although we came there specifically to enjoy the patio, we sat inside. The server was very short with us and rushed us to order - I was also getting food to go and after i told him I'd be ready to order in 2 minutes (at 9:20pm) he came back and told me that the order needed to be in before 9:45. Understandable, since they closed at 10, but I've never been treated in such a way by a restaurant that still had 45 minutes before they closed. They either need to change their hours and close earlier if they don't want any business in the last hour. I encourage everyone to try this place, but don't expect friendly customer service if you stroll in after 9!",

I also ordered a Thai iced tea to go which was a bit too sweet for my taste but was still enjoyable.   MUST TRY Pumpkin curry- perfect blend of curry and spicyness. Delicious over rice. Ask for extra spicy sauce on the side and add to taste.",

    "text": "I came here to have dinner and catch up with a few friends. We love Thai food, and we have tried almost every Thai restaurant within a 5-radius of Shadyside--except this one. So, of course, we had to try this place out before we graduate to the 10-mile radius and beyond (gas prices and traffic be damned, we want our fill of Thai goodness!).  Anyway, I arrived first, and the waiter (manager? owner? Sorry I can't be sure, but he's the one with the French accent) greeted me warmly and sat me down first. I told him two more people were going to arrive soon, so he quickly got me three glasses of iced water, menus, and silverware. After my friends arrive, he comes to introduce himself and the restaurant, and asked if we would like any beverages. One of my friends orders some tea, which he gets for her in no time. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, we order our food. I ordered the Green Curry Noodles with Tofu (spice level: 4), and my friends ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp (spice level: 0 [she doesn't do well with spicy food]) and Pad See Ew with Tofu (spice level: 3). It wasn't very busy at this time, so our food came out within 10-15 minutes.  My Green Curry Noodles with Tofu looked great. It had rice noodles, bell peppers, green beans, broccoli, eggplant, and Thai basil. I took a few sips of the broth and tasted really good and had a nice kick to it. My friends also really liked their respective dishes. Halfway through our meal, the place really started getting busy. It seemed like between each bite/sip of my food, a table or two became filled. By the time we were ready to leave, the place was packed. Nevertheless, our waiter never failed to refill our glasses with water and ask if we needed anything. When we were done, he got us a few take-out boxes for our leftovers and the check. Because of the good food and excellent service, my friends and I decided to give a generous tip.  Overall, a very good place to have a nice Thai meal. Although it wasn't the best I've had, it does rank pretty high in my personal list of Thai restaurants. I will make an effort to come back again to try their Pad Thai, which is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and their desserts. Honestly, who could resist Pumpkin Custard or the Sago & Black Bean with Coconut Cream? Even though I'm allergic to mangoes, I'll even try their seasonal Sweet Mango with Sticky Rice (with 911 on speed dial, of course!).",

I like things to be on the spicier side, so I got 7/10 and it was really good (made my nose run tho). They have lunch and dinner prices weekdays (dinner is $3 more), but dinner prices all day on weekends. Portions are all the same regardless. Pricy, but authentic.  Update: tonight i tried the pineapple fried rice and mango curry. The fried rice was nothing special, just regular fried rice with bits of pineapple. I'm used to pineapple fried rice that has the flavor of pineapple infused throughout the dish, but that was not the case here. As for mango curry, I liked it better with pumpkin. Still good place.",

    "text": "Food is delicious, I would give it a 3 stars due to service. This place is BYOB  and no additional fee for corking - definite bonus in my book. Their waitress was new and it was a bit difficult to get someone's attention. It wasn't overly busy when we went on a Monday night, but it took multiple tries to get the attention of the waitresses.   First impression is that the place is very cute. Has a very hipster rustic feel for being a Thai restaurant. The interior has a good mood lighting - nice atmosphere. It was pretty cold though. Granted I went on a freezing day but we were seated right by the window so it was way more draft than I would have enjoyed.   TOFU PARADISE -- Wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this but I was surprised. They used a former tofu and cut into bite size pieces. I thought the cabbage was the best part to be honest because it had a little sweetness but not so sweet as the peanut sauce. It was a bit too much for my tastes, but slowly grew on me.   YELLOW CURRY NOODLES -- This was surprisingly good. A healthy (huge...let's face it it's not really good for you), portion of yellow curry, noodles, bean sprouts, chicken, red onion, and topped with fried onions. I got a 6/10 on the spicy scale and I will give it to them - it was pretty spicy. I think next time I'll go with a 5. If you're not good with spicy foods I would urge you to opt for a 1-2. The broth was really well made and flavored. And there was such a big portion I could have taken the rest to go and had left overs with rice.   My friend got the pad Thai which I did not try, but I thought her portion was rather small for the dinner price. I expected a bit more. Compared to other Thai restaurants I am inclined to say their portion to price ratio is smaller.   Their menu offered a pretty wide variety of appetizers, rice, noodle, and other dishes. I will be back to try them.",

I really wanted a noodle dish, but I love the curries, so I ordered the green curry noodle soup with vegetables. YUM! They use eggplant in that one, which is smokey and juicy and was the envy of the table. I can't speak for the lunch sizes, but the dinner portions are plenty. My girlfriend and I used to split a single curry all the time, but I doubt many others would agree with me on that one!  I love the tom yum and tom kha soups. I am vegetarian and was told in the past I could get vegetarian tom yum... but apparently ALL soup bases are currently made with chicken broth - or at least this is what our server told us on our last visit in January 2015.  Regarding spice levels... I'd say the soups are all spicy, so order low spice levels if you please. The tom yum is always very hot. Noodle dishes (pad see ew, etc) can be ordered at a spice level 0, if you'd prefer. The curries are obviously spicy, but very closely match the expected levels, so order spice levels moderately and you shouldn't be disappointed (or surprised!)",

I found myself drooling over half of the menu. A really great selection. The pineapple curry my friend had was spot on, the vegetarian spicy tom yum gai noodle soup was superb and my friend's shrimp special stirfry was super good. The fried calamari appetizer was a bit small, but it was clearly fresh and delicious.    Prices - extremely reasonable. The three of us each had entrees and shared an app and it came to 50 bucks with tax and tip. Amazing!  Service - friendly, genuine, prompt, and yes, we had the lovely tall Thai woman/transgender waitress. Honestly, she is one of the loveliest people ever. We were seated and out in an hour. We werent' rushed and everything was timely. The place was absolutely packed, with only two waitresses.   Ambiance - it is small (probably seats 30 max), and I don't think they take reservations, so get there at a decent time! The table layout make it not cramped at all though. It's not romantic and can get a tad noisy, so it's perfect for a friend gathering.   Bonus! BYOB, you can't go wrong.",

I will echo what some others have said regarding their heat index being more tailored to American tastes, I ordered an spice level 9 of 9 for my Pad Thai, and in comparison to other Thai spots like Nicky's, or Thai Me Up on the Southside, a 9 is mild. That being said, flavor of dishes here is great, 4/5.",

Our server was very friendly, and very nice, and it wasn't until the end that this individual put a sour taste in my mouth. My fiancee and I were having dinner with another couple, and we were basically booted out right after we had paid the bill. I understand the place is small, people are waiting and that the tables need to turn over quickly so that the servers can make money, but we literally sat for 5 minutes after paying the bill and ending our conversation to leave, when our server literally took our beverages away from us and started cleaning our table right in front of us as if we weren't even there anymore. We were literally finishing up our sentences...it was really, really rude and I just can't get over it.   So after that, I may think twice as far as where I take my business.",

The waitress was also very nice and pleasant.  She even asked about how spicy we wanted our food.    Absolutely perfect food.  Defiantly get the peanut sauce.",

    "text": "\"No sign on the front means this place is going to be the shit!\"-- Says my roommate.   And that, it was. We began our magical thai food experience with the fresh spring rolls and mango salad, which were both DELICIOUSSSS, fresh and addictive. Then we tried the tom kua soup. As a typical favorite spicy coconut soup of mine, I knew what to expect, or so I thought. This soup, was like a warm, coconut, creamy orgasm in my mouth! Literally. We both licked the bowl clean, there was some major food porn happening over at table 5.   After the coconut soup came (was that pun intended?) the pumpkin tofu curry arrived at our table with a blob of rice. SO Abso-freaking-lutely amazing! Big chunks of spicy tofu with moist pumpkin bits. We devoured that dish as well. Never had a better tofu in my life.  Did I mention our bombtastic waitress/waiter/transgender thai woman/man that was so cute and bowed to us and spoke thai? So awesome! Ah. I love. I wish I could go back. Only $28 dollars for the best thai food of my life. So ridiculously cheap it's embarrassing if you live in Pittsburgh and have not been to the Smiling Banana Leaf yet... Go now! Oh and it's BYOB! God. Why did I ever move?",

    "text": "I showed up Saturday night with the GF, and there seemed to only be three staff total, what looked like the owner and two waitresses. Between them, they were cleaning, taking orders (including takeout orders), delivering food... the whole gauntlet. As a result, here's what our night approximately looked like:  7:45 - Arrive at restaurant 7:50 - Table opens up 8:05 - Get seated at table 8:25 - Take order 8:35 - Appetizer arrives 8:50 - Entree arrives 9:10 - Finish meal, pay at counter because we didn't want to wait for the check  I realize that this is a small independent restaurant, but c'mon, an hour from when a table opens up to when the entree arrives? I don't think it would kill them to hire an additional waitress.  So despite this pretty major gripe, Smiling Banana Leaf still gets a 3 because the food was quite good, and inexpensive to boot. We ordered the as entrees the duck curry and tofu eggplant basil. The flavors for both were excellent, bright but well-balanced, although the tofu eggplant basil needed more eggplant.   Minus the whole time issue, I would give SBL a 4.5 (5 if the eggplant dish had more eggplant), but I just can't overlook waiting 15-20 minutes just to place your order, and the overall slowness. Sorry.",

My friend and I shared a bunch of appetizers and each got a soup.  Variety is the spice of life, after all.  I wanted to try everything.  The fried spring rolls (vegetable) were very very good.  I think the dumplings (steamed) were probably some of the best I've ever had.  The Moo Yang beef was also very good (I love sticky rice!).  I got the tom kha soup, which is my absolute favorite at Lulu's noodles in Oakland.  This tom kha was thicker, perhaps made with a heavier coconut milk.  There were also inedible leaves in the soup, but I didn't mind picking them out too much since the soup was delicious.  It's much richer and sweeter than Lulu's (which is more brothier and has a nice spice to it), but I'd say just as delicious.  I still prefer Lulu's because the heavier/richer soup left me not really wanting to eat the last few bites because I was full/overwhelmed by the flavor.      I highly recommend this place.  Not too expensive, free parking.  It's small though.  We were there at 5:30 on a weeknight, but I can easily see this place filling up fast on a weekend.",

    "text": "Smiling Banana Leaf! This small but amazing Thai restaurant is tucked away in Highland Park, which is hard to get to without a car.  As a result, I haven't heard of this place from any of my college friends.  Rather, it was a graduate student who told my friend about the place, and so two nights ago we went to have dinner there.  The restaurant was very small, but thankfully not very crowded like Point Brugge Cafe.  Their menu included noodles, fried rice, curries, and so on.  Both me and my friend got the red curry.  It comes with a bowl of rice.  Apparently they also had purple glutinous rice (which I love) but we didn't get it because I didn't know about it until the customers beside us ordered it.  The next time I go I'm gonna order that =X  They allowed us to choose spiciness, from 1-10.  I of course wanted a 10 and it wasn't that spicy at all.  They definitely gave a lot of curry.  My friend easily ate 2 bowls of rice for the amount of curry they gave.  It was very, very good.  I'm not sure if I like the bamboo in it though.  It was kind of over cooked (probably because it was canned bamboo or something), and the peas and carrots made it seem like they used some frozen vegetable blend, which didn't go well with the curry.  But the pork soaked up the smell of the spices really well, and overall the curry was just really amazing with the rice.  I can't wait to come back again and to try some of their other dishes!",

The khao soi here (a dish I generally adore) was so incredibly bland and flavorless, I briefly panicked and thought I had showed up at the wrong restaurant. It could be because I have a very close attachment to the idea of what khao soi should taste like. It could even be because my taste buds are dysfunctional and cannot perceive more subtle flavors (although I doubt this). It may just have been an off night for the restaurant.

I would highly recommend it to any one living in Pittsburgh.  Food: The food is simply delicious.  I would highly recommend getting the Chicken Paradise, any of the curry and the appetizers.  Each are a nice portion, but may be small for a big eater.  Lunch prices are around $8 while dinner hovers around $10-12.  For the quality, these prices are unmatched.  I would recommend Smiling Banana Leaf over Bangkok Balcony any day.  Service: The owner? of the restaurant is very friendly and will make your visit even more memorable.   Dinner hours are quite busy.  Due to the limited seating and the popularity, you may have to wait for a while to get a table.

I also agree with Jarrett H. in that they seem to take you for a fool when ordering a high spice level, so they just serve everything U.K. style. In conclusion, I feel that the Smiling Banana Leaf does not practice respect for the customer's requests. Vegans and spicaholics beware.",

I made an order at 7pm on a Saturday, and was told it would be a 40 minutes wait. That in itself seemed excessive. So I arrive at 7:40, ask for my food, and she says it will be another 10 minutes. That seemed long for a mis-estimated time. And yet ten minutes later, it was still not ready. I ended up waiting until 8:20 to get my food. People who complained more got their food sooner. I wouldn't have minded if they warned me beforehand about the wait, and given me an accurate time. But an hour and twenty minutes for food is ridiculous, and making me wait in their small entranceway for an additional 40 minutes is also ridiculous.",
