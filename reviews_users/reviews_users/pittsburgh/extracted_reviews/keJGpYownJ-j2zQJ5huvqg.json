I've never been in the bar section, I can't imagine how loud it is in there, but even for a weeknight dinner I could barely hear the people at my table and kept having to ask them to repeat themselves. Too bad, because like I said before, the food is out of this world. I've switched to getting take-out from Bigham Tavern because I want the food but don't want to sit in the restaurant.",

By far the best wing night I've had in pittsburgh =D I will say the wait gets extremely long on Wednesday Wing Night but the $.44 cent wings are totally worth every minute. They have a large selection of flavors to chose from (over 26 flavors I believe.) If you aren't into wings...dont worry they also have $1.25 tacos the same night plus good beer specials.   Great place to bring friends and watch sports as well",

    "text": "I visited Bigham Tavern for the summer session of Restaurant Week - the promise of bacon chipotle ice cream drew me in. Since it was a Monday, I was seated quickly and the server was prompt in handing over menus and taking my drink order (and she seemed to check on me nearly every 3 minutes, which seemed excessive, but better than the alternative). I went with the restaurant week menu - pork belly and white bean soup, a salad with poached pears and goat cheese, an appetizer with pulled pork three ways, a smoked pork loin entree with julienned vegetables and a potato fritter, and the infamous bacon chipotle ice cream.  The soup was good, but nothing special - it tasted almost exactly like the ham and bean soup my grandma used to make, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The salad wasn't what I was expecting since the menu description mentioned pancetta and I didn't notice any meat. Also, the salad contained just the teensiest bit of balsamic reduction - it could have used a bit more. The tri-pork crisp appetizer was my favorite part of the meal; it was pulled pork three ways - Mexican, American, and Asian. However, I bit into a huge glob of straight wasabi on the Asian one - wasn't expecting that. Otherwise, this app was pretty great. The smoked pork loin tasted delightfully smoky, and the potato fritter was delicious as well. My julienned vegetables weren't exactly cooked, though - the zucchini was, but the carrots were as firm as if they were raw. The flavors were good, but there was just something really off about those carrots. As for the ice cream, honestly, I was disappointed. By the time it got to me, it was halfway melted, so it was more like a cold soup with a dollop of ice cream floating in it. I could hardly taste the bacon, nor the chocolate, because the chipotle overpowered *everything*. This was like chipotle ice cream with cocoa powder and some bacon bits - not what I was expecting, and not necessarily something I want to eat again. In summary, it was a good meal for the price - 4 courses for $20.15 is a crazy good deal - but there were too many inconsistencies for me to give it more than 3 stars.",

Tons of choices - especially for brunch - the meal of choice for my group of 7 of Saturday. Our service was nice and quick and the food was also \"nice.\" I split two dishes with a buddy: the Pigless Biscuit and Les' Shrimp & Grits. The former was a biscuit filled with cucumber, marinated red peppers and fig jam. The fig jam was amazing and the cucumber fresh, but the rest was fair. I've had fresher biscuits and the peppers seemed odd, both in texture and taste. Oh well - it was worth a shot. The shrimp and grits were solid, if a bit runny. Maybe a lil' less cheese and it would've been perfect. One friend ordered a fruit cup and was met with 5 thin orange slices more suitable for a tall glass of Blue Moon rather than a $3 fruit \"cup.\" No worries though, since our lovely server took it off of his bill when he expressed concern. All things considered, we had a relaxing Saturday morning brunch in a nice place with great company. I'll definitely return, though I may try a few different menu items.",

The room was tastefully decorated and set up ideally (U shape) for a large group. We opted for food to come out family style. I cannot compliment the food enough! It was delicious, hot (even the eggs!) and plentiful. Everyone had seconds and we still had some left over. Extremely fair pricing, especially considering what you get. Great prices on drinks, too! Huge mimosas and loaded Bloody Marys! Service was incredible, especially considering the large group! No one was ever waiting for anything! Highly, highly recommend. Thank you to Sarah and Bigham Tavern for going above and beyond!",

The menu is huge and overwhelming from burgers, salads to sandwiches and many mac and cheese entrees. I went with the bourbon burger and my date got the buffalo chicken sandwich. My burger was cooked to perfection and topped with cheddar cheese, bbq sauce and an onion ring. For 50 cents more I added fries. My date ordered loaded tator tots which were interesting- tator tot with cheese and sour cream cooked inside. The service was great and would love to go back in the summer to try their outdoor area.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't already reviewed Bigham Tavern. My husband and I live nearby and we go here all of the time. Whenever we have friends or family in town, this is our go-to place to bring them to show them what awesome food Mount Washington has to offer. There are a few major categories of deliciousness on BT's menu: wings, mac and cheese, burgers, and drinks. (This is not all they have on the menu, but these are the things we usually order.) BT is known for its wings, and for good reason because they're amazing. They have quite a long list of wing options. My favorites are the hot garlic and the gnarley (mix of buffalo sauce, bbq sauce, and garlic, I think). I am not usually a big fan of chicken wings but these are s.o. g.o.o.d. They are always hot, crispy and just salty and garlicky enough for perfection. They come with ranch or blue cheese. You can get a basket of carrots and celery with 'em for $1.   Continuing along, the mac and cheese is another winner. The menu offers several options, all of which are served in a skillet with a soft pretzel stick on the side. I used to adore the Greek Mac but they took it off the menu, which I'm a little salty about but the Buff Chick Mac is almost as good. I also love the burgers, especially the rodeo burger. They will do any burger with a veggie patty. The burgers are gigantic and will easily make for two meals. Other menu standouts for me are the hot cheese bites appetizer and the grilled romaine salad (try it - they put romaine on the grill and make a salad - it's weird, smoky, crunchy, and awesome.)  This is a tavern, so the beverages are an important. They always have a strong draft list with a good variety of different beers and ciders bottled and on tap. They also have a surprisingly good cocktail list that is updated seasonally, and wine. Check out their happy hour every weekday from 5-7pm. They also have half off bottles of wine on Tuesdays and Wednesday is wing night - 44cent wings. The only reason I leave off one star is because the service can be inconsistent. I have many times had excellent servers, but a few times we've had less than great experiences. Overall though, Bigham is a winner - definitely check it out when you're on the Mt. Wash.",

It may have tasted even better because we were all nursing hangovers and it was the first meal of the day. Either way, my Cuban was very good. Everyone had wings & we all agreed they were the best item we ate. We also ordered the loaded tots, which were different than I thought they'd be, but good anyway. I have nothing negative to say.

They seemed preoccupied in trying to get their closing work done.  The girl bartender with the long black hair never once even looked our way much less asked us if we needed anything.  The guy bartender helped us when we first walked in but then basically ignored us until we flagged him down.  Our glasses were clearly empty and even pushed forward but at no time did he check on us.  Again we had to call him over to get drinks.   It was not that busy to excuse this kind of service.  It's very disappointing as I do like this bar.   I hope management will consider further training for their bartenders in proper customer service.",

From all the TVs to the patio and the big room in the back, this is an awesome place with good food and drink.   The only exception is that the vegetarian options are just not ideal. The black bean burger, which was on the menu for several years (which I think was just a frozen patty I could make at home) has been replaced with a portobello mushroom burger that is over-marinated and not what I want if I'm going out for dinner at a nicer bar. The veggie pita wrap is also subpar. I'd love to see seitan wings, a housemade veggie patty, veggie chili, or something else unique and protein-filled for us veggies on the mount.

    "text": "I went to Brigham Tavern with friends for brunch, I love a good brunch spot that takes reservations. The menu also is very extensive, I actually couldn't think of anything I might have wanted to eat that wasn't present on the menu. Unfortunately, I don't think I made the right selection. The chicken on the chicken and waffles was slightly spicy and also dry, and the waffle was closer to eggo than to belgium, another unexpected disappointment. I did try my friends shrimp and grits which were pretty tasty and the table seemed to enjoy the mimosas. Service was not good, but Sunday brunch seemed an extremely busy period so maybe it's excusable. Ultimately, would only return with someone for whom having lots of options matters and if you think it may be hard to get a space for a group for an afternoon brunch. In general, id continue researching.",

    "text": "If there was ever a restaurant that personified Pittsburgh, it would certainly be Bigham Tavern. Tucked away on Mount Washington on the corner of Bigham St and Virginia Ave, this is certainly a stop worth making.  The atmosphere here oozes that, \"hometown-feel-good\" kind of vibe, which is only amplified by the wonderfully attentive and friendly staff. Upon walking in, you have the option to sit at the large wrap around bar, or take a seat in one of their several booths and tables. There truly is not a bad seat in the house!  With regard to the menu: Bigham is infamous for their Wednesday wing night! Also affectionally referred to as Wingsday, the wings are served as flats&drums, or boneless if that's your kind of thing. Yuengling is on special for $3 and wings are $0.50. Very reasonably priced, given the national chicken wing shortage (yes, that's seriously a thing). There's also a wide variety of sauces to choose from, Cluckin' Hot being my absolute favorite (Yes, it is indeed Cluckin' Hot) and Jackal coming in second (think, hot honey mustard). In addition, BT is also known for their mac and cheese, which is well worth whatever amount of calories are in it! The mac and cheese can be served several different ways, and is always brought out in a toasty skillet with a fluffy pretzel bread stick to complete for dipping, yum! You cannot go wrong choosing anything on the menu.  Living in the Pittsburgh area, you see several restaurants come and go. Brigham Tavern is one of those places that has become a PGH fixture, and for good reason!",

My drink (alcoholic peach tea) wasn't very strong, but had decent flavor. Husband said his ham sandwich was great; other guests liked their club sandwich and tacos. Not sure if we'll be back to try the wings. Might try a quieter night. The pub ambiance was a plus.",

This place is always crowded- so just be prepared. They have great happy hour specials and a lot of different drinks options (both beer and cocktails), that are changing often.  Appetizer- you have to get the hot pepper cheese balls Sandwich- my favorite veggie burger in town! My husband says the Buffalo chicken sandwich is amazing too. GET THE WINGS! gnarley!  Service is always SUPER nice and accommodating. Sara (I believe is the manager) has always been more than helpful. The food can take awhile- so grab a drink and be patient.  Only complaint is the brunch menu. You cannot get anything that is not on it and the options aren't that great. So we usually wait until after brunch to go for our beer mosas!",

Everything we got was incredible...except for the wings. The wing itself was not very good, and there was virtually no sauce on them. So much so that 2 of us had to ask for a side of sauce. My favorite thing we had was the Pittsburgh Flatbread which is pierogis, pot roast, and cheese on a flatbread and also the Rogi Bowl with chili was awesome. Great beer selection and our server was fantastic with our large party. They have handheld ipads that you just sign and pay when you're ready to go which was SO CLUTCH and easy. The hype kind of ruined the wings for me, but otherwise a real nice experience.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped here Saturday afternoon to have an early dinner and get some drinks before a concert downtown. We wanted to go somewhere a little outside of downtown so it was easy to find street parking and it was not very busy.  I had previewed the menu ahead of time to be sure they had plenty of vegetarian options (they do!) and a decent beer selection. Being that I'm not from Pittsburgh, I was hoping to sample some local beers while there, but I was a bit disappointed to find that they had only two local Pitt brews on tap. (the website was not updated with current draft selections, which isn't too cool).  Based on the menu, the reviews, I guess I had higher expectations than I should've for this place. Hence the \"A-Ok\" review. It is what it is. A neighborhood burger and beer bar, but nothing more.  Our waitress not very attentive and our food was okay. My wife really liked her fish tacos. My veggie black bean tasted great, but instead of a bun, it came with bread with tough crust, almost too tough to bite through. I knew when I ordered that I was getting housemade chips with my burger, but I was a bit disappointed and wishing I had upgraded to french fries (although I'm not a big fan of chips with my burger, you might enjoy them more than I did).  We were going to try their dessert, but after waiting so long on beer cheese for my wife (she asked before the meal and received it after our meal AND was charged for it), we decided to just ask for the check and take off. We went somewhere else for a few more drinks.  I can't see going out of my way to go back there and since it's not on my way to anywhere I go, I guess I won't return. But the experience wasn't terrible. I was just surprised at how inattentive our waitress was when it was not busy there. It's too bad most of my experience/review was rooted in the service, but that's a big part of the experience for me. Otherwise, I can cook veggie burgers on my grill.",

They have so many menu items and the build your own options are a huge plus in my book. Who doesn't want to build their own Burger, Mac, Sammich, Salad and 'Rogies. To top it off the amount of topping options they give you to build your dinner masterpiece is just incredible. If I am ever struggling to pick my meal it's nice to have the option to build your own. But I didn't struggle with deciding this day, I instantly knew when I seen the smokehouse Mac on the menu I had to try it. I love smoked Gouda, pulled pork and sweet Memphis bbq sauce so it was a no brainer. This Mac was hands down probably one of the best Mac n Cheeses I have ever had. It came with a pub pretzel which was a nice bonus!   My mom built her own with bacon, provolone, smoked Gouda and white cheddar. She loved it! I do have to say that it is not a super creamy Mac and I prefer that over the extra creamy stuff.   I loved the pub style atmosphere and the larger booths that make entertaining groups much more comfortable. I highly recommend!",

Me and five of my friends thought it'd be a good place to go and grab a few beers and play some darts.  We've been there before, decent beers and a somewhat decent atmosphere.  Not this time.  We got our first round, a couple beers and a bucket.  After that, two of our friends were at the bar for 25 MINUTES and didn't get served!!!  They moved to different parts of the bar also, and the bartenders, TWO OF THEM, blatantly ignored them.  We came out because we were playing darts in the back and wondered what was taking so long, we skipped their turns about 5 times already, I even loudly said to the one bartender, \"Excuse me!\" but she purposely ignored me.  I guess we weren't douchey enough, because it seems like you have to wear a too tight polo shirt and have a False sense of entitlement to get good service there.   Well they lost out on about $200 Friday night because we were going to stay there for the night and drink, but for some reason we weren't good enough to be served.  The six of us that were there will never set foot in there again, and we told all of our friends about our horrible service that night and they will not go there either.  Maybe the owner doesn't give a shit and thinks he has enough business, but when bad word gets around, no matter how many customers you have, it's bad for business.  All I know is that roughly 20 people that would have considered going there before will DEFINITELY not set foot in there again.  You can thank your horrible bartenders for that, Bingham Tavern.",

Several of my friends live within walking distance of Bigham, and it is certainly a nice step down form the steep prices, perched on Grandview.   This another one of those places that I wish had a regular crowd featuring a know-it-all mailman and an accountant who is (for all intents and purposes) fused to his bar stool. Sadly, it is overrun with \"Bros\" and \"Dudes\" and girls who look like this wasn't their first choice, but the South Side was at capacity.  The staff is hardworking, but they never seem to be able to keep up. I've often sat for 15, 20, sometimes 25 minutes after saying \"can i get my check\" only to have it come and not be quite accurate. The food is ok, and the prices are a little higher than the food quality would mandate, but they are not astronomical.   We've gone there for football and hockey games in the past, and though many of the TVs are HD sets, there is often not an HD feed in them. This is annoying to me.   There is a back room with pool table and electronic darts, but it feels unfinished... like you are in the basement of a McMansion that was supposed to have a rec room, but Dad got caught in an insider trading scandal and had to lay off the workers so now you go down there to escape the heat even though there isn't much to do.   I don't know... i want to like this place, and i think there is potential but the clientele and the poor service just leaves me very ambivalent about Bigham.",

The wings were cooked just right and the sauces are phenominal! OMG! you may not be able to find another burger as good as the ones they have here! They are made from an aged sirloin and they have such a rich flavor! Our burgers were cooked perfectly! Of course we got way too much food and couldn't finish it all. But, we tried our darndest because every bite was mouth watering! The burgers are served with house made potato chips. Get those and don't do the up sell. they are really good chips and you can't go wrong! To top it off they have a fantastic beer list! And apparently this is a great place to watch sports. There was a hockey game on the night that we were there. If we are ever in Pittsburgh again we are definitely coming back!",

    "text": "This place has made some drastic improvements since it changed over from Kaib's. While it is a little more pricey, it is still incredibly affordable, with most items on the menu being under $10. Newly revamped menu, with a bunch of items that I haven't tried yet, but everything I have had so on it is pretty good quality. They have some of best wings in the city, in fact I think they were just voted so, with over 20 different kinds of sauces, and 44 cent wing nights on Wednesdays, or during any Pirates, Steelers, or Pens game. Not all of the flavors will blow your taste buds, but there are definitely a handful that keep me coming back on a regular basis. (I would recommend the Red Hot Honey, or the Gnarly if you like spicy).  Their beer selection seems to be growing on almost a monthly basis. With a pretty decent variety on draft, and rather large selection in bottle. This is a great place to watch any sporting event, with TV's visible for almost any point in the bar, and often big crowds to cheer along side.  This is also a great place to come chill. In their back room they have 2 pool tables and a dartboard, and this summer they are planning on building a large deck, which should provide a nice place for some outdoor dining.  My biggest complaint with this place is some what poor wait staff. Don't get this confused with their bartenders, which always seem to be friendly and hardworking, but they often seem to cycle through waitresses that move incredibly slow, and are never around when you need another drink.",

    "text": "Wednesday is Wing Nite! 35 cent wings and THE best wings in Pittsuburgh.... voted that way.  Of course that can be subjective depending on your likes. Kaib's uses their own sauce that not TOO hot but is very flavorful and they serve \"half wings\" (leg & wing parts separated) The wings are also well cooked... crunchy but not dry or undercooked like some places.    The burgers are HUGE, the Fry's are the kind of Fry's served in the 70's & 80's ... not mushy but a little crunchy so the kids love em.  Be sure and pay attention the \"home of the Pittsburgh Pirates Inc.\" sign when you walk in... it's quite a story.  This is the kind of place people search out when you visit a city. It's got a real Pittsburgh ambiance... It's a the kind of place \"locals\" hang out at the and kind of hearty food that hearkens back to a Steelworker kinda place.  It's a great place to check out if you're heading up to any of the more expensive places along Grandview avenue for a bit of local flair and less expensive drinks",

    "text": "This is a terrific little neighborhood bar with a very, very popular wing night on Wednesdays.  Be prepared to wait, but the large variety of sauces are intriguing.  In our first visit, we sampled four, and the winner was:  Honey Garlic Habanero.  Just perfect.  The signature (award-winning) wings have that palm oil taste that I associate with theater popcorn.  Tasty.  The cajun dry rubbed wings are nicely seasoned.  The wet cajun wings also had a bit of that palm oil flavor.  They do a nice job with their tap selection, and there were some nice craft beers available.  A plate came by with a kielbasa sausage that looked and smelled amazing.  Next time I stop by, that's what I'm going to try.  My ONLY complaint is that it's kind of ridiculously loud in the bar area, and I don't understand how the servers are able to communicate with their customers.  Somebody put an EQ on that sound system and scoop out the high mids (2.5k specifically), please!  The outdoor patio area was full of patrons, and there was a well-organized waiting list for tables.  We were lucky enough to find a pair of bar seats open together and snatched them up, but wow, the ambient volume of the room was around 95 db on my sound meter.  Outside would have been more comfortable for us, sound-wise, but the atmosphere inside is fun.  Our impression of the serving staff as quite favorable.  Engaging and friendly people both in the hostess area and at the bar.  We will be back to explore the menu further, and it's no wonder that the wings in this place have been recognized as the city's best.  They are quite good.",

Old time bar feeling mixed with lots of flat screen TVs everywhere, a perfect place to watch a game. Can't wait to go back and try some wings.",

I used to take hot wings for granted. Kaib's made me fall in love all over again.   I remember when they used to call 'em Wing Dings around here back in the day.  Minor caveat: The joint is loud and rowdy on a Saturday night. Pick a different time to dine here unless you have a high tolerance for the obnoxious and the imbibed.",

I walked in had to seat myself.  Waitress service was extremely slow.  I was from out of town and do not know the menu well, so I ordered the cheap 35 cent wings on wednesday and they had only four sauces listed on the main menu.  Apparrently they had a 2nd menu with many more sauces listed.  So from the main menu I ordered some kind of garlic parmesan wings, which were really really bad.  But I ordered them, so I was stuck with it.  Bottom line: 1. Slow waitress service (Oh and i was there at 530PM, so it wasnt anywhere near packed at the time, so it wasnt like the waitress was swamped), 2. Make sure you ask for the Wing sauce menu. 3. Would not go back",

The noise kind of comes with the place so we couldn't really complain. The waitress forgot what drink I ordered and had to ask me 4 separate times after I placed it.. Regular unsweet tea!!! Then! When she brought it, I asked for a straw. She ran off and then literally threw a straw in my glass!! I didn't even drink my drink. We had to keep getting her attention and she forgot my boyfriends water that was the first thing he ordered. The food was pretty good. However when he ordered his wings she said do you want veggies and ranch. He said yes and it was charged an extra $2 for it! Never made us aware. After she brought us the check, she asked if we wanted dessert!! It was just a terrible meal, service wise. We will not return. Owners need to focus on customer service as much as getting young waiters in there so they can actually receive good service.",

The menu is way different and the prices went up, but the food is still good and everyone is still nicer here than another similar establishment located on Shiloh...  Wing flavor menu is HUGE now! Huge and delicious. I loved the wings when it was only 4 flavors to choose from, and I love them even more that they got creative with them and made about 30 more. Also, tons more beers to choose from. And clean fresh lines in their tap system.  They're putting in an outdoor patio soon and I'm pretty sure it should be ready for summer '12. Since I live about a block away, I'm sure ill be spending a lot more time there once they have the outdoor spot. I'm a sucker for a good patio.  My one gripe is they only had beer battered fries for about a month when they first switched over. That was enough to make me fall in love with them, then they took them away and I've been whiney about it ever since. Need those damn fries back in my life",

And that was almost 9pm. Btw, this happened at the wing night. The second time was the waitress, she showed no care about our table, like help us order after 30mins waiting, keep forgetting to fill up our beers etc. the third time was when I try to call in to order some takeout, the waitress answered my call and told me hold for a minute. I waited couple minutes and she started to get my order, while I was still trying to tell her what do I want, she picked up another phone call tell them to hold for a sec, then come back which I was fine with it. So I kept going, before I finish my order, she just start to talk on the other line and taking another order while I am able to hear everything, after a little bit, she put me on hold!!! That was very rude!! I understand they probably busy, but at least you have to show some respect and let me finished my order or let me know if you are having an emergency. I will be totally cool. But this is out of line, they are not going to have any business from me, my family and my friends! If they keep treating people with no respect, hard to make people come back.",

Any night of the week is a good night to go, though expect a wait during busy times, like Wednesday wing night.   They have so many awesome wing flavors, and the wings are delicious! I also like their salads and sandwiches as well. The beer choices were pretty excellent as well, and they had some cool cocktails on their menu to boot!   Everything is reasonably priced, and the people are friendly.",

    "text": "I want to give this place five stars, and I would if some items were cleaned up.  I'll get to that later.  Regardless, I really liked this place during my Friday lunch visit.  I liked the menu.  It was similar to a more hipster place on Shiloh, with a nice selection of burgers, wings, and other \"better\" munchies.  They also had Lenten specials.  Lots of different draft beers and tons of bottles from what I could see.  The bartender wasn't overly friendly (Problem #1... he seemed not too happy to be at work which is a definite turn off.)    I ordered a crab sake sandwich, given it was Friday in Lent and it was a staple on their menu I wanted to see what they were workin' with.  I think the crab cake is the \"end all be all\" of a restaurant--if it is fresh you know the food is good.  If it is a dense puck of breading then you know what the restaurant is like.  It was phenomial.  I got the sweet potato fries which were just so-so (it's hard to find good SP fries, IMO).  The bread that it was served on was SO FRESH that I had a hard time not picking at my pieces.  The portions were reasonable and you could tell the main dish was the star of the show because they side portions were perfect.    Sitting at the bar was the classic Mt Washington crowd-- the obnoxious frat guys, the mt washington natives, young professionals.  I really liked this atmosphere but Problem #2 is that the obnoxious frat guys kind of turned the environment .  I mean, there is no need to state loudly (for all the bar to hear, at noon-or any time of the day) \"Worthless Yinzers\" during a conversation with your buddy.  I mean, you really aren't impressing anyone.    The draft beers are expensive to my no-longer-a-city-dweller perspective, with two beers and a sandwich costing a little over $20, but I would go back again for the food.  It was awesome.",

On Saturday we ordered, the Jess's Grits and the chicken and waffles. Pretty decent sized portions. I was not a fan of the syrup but it was good. I think you either love it or hate it. The grits were amazing so yummy and super filling. Both meals were amazing ! We ate everything  On Tuesday, we order the Philly steak sandwich and wings with hot cheese bites. Everything was good and hot and came out very fast. The wing sauce was spicy but sweet.  I think for us the highlight we're the drinks. If you do brunch , get the mimosa pitcher it's 32 ounces for like 18 bucks. I think I poured 8 or 9 glasses. My bf had the Bloody Mary and he wouldnt drink and eat it fast enough. The wait staff was friendly and super helpful when it came to questions out the menu. The parking isn't bad and we didn't have to wait at all. We will definitely come back .",

    "text": "Testing out my new Yelp review format on this one! I was in town for business and was able to meet up with some friends here and they told me they had the best wings in town.. so we shall see.  Appearance: Situated on a sloping road perched on Mt. Washington the parking situation is grim. You can MAYBE catch a spot in the open lot directly across from the bar or snag a spot on the street. Good luck. Lol. The name \"Bigham Tavern\" led me to believe that I'd be walking into some rundown, dive bar. Nope. I was wrong and I'm glad I was. Nice, modern feel, basic and simple styling. There isn't too much flare on the walls or many decorations at all, just TVs so that you can keep up with whatever sports you're into!  Atmosphere: The place very lively both times that I came. The waitresses are all friendly (flirty) and make you feel welcomed. Some of the tables were a lil' sticky and not perfectly clean, but I guess it's almost expected in a wing joint. Lol.  Service: Service was on point! Hailey took care of maybe 12 of us at once that Monday and she was excellent. She didn't miss a beat. Smiling, making sure we had everything we needed and making good suggestions. I can't remember my 2nd waitress's name, but she was just as awesome when I came solo on Wednesday. It's safe to say that service is a priority here and that they take pride in treating their customers well.  Food: I was able to try 8 different flavors of wings over the course of my 2 visits here. - Hyena: A buffalo sauce with a dash of garlic topped with parmesan cheese. One of my favorite sauces here. The cheese really put this flavor over the top. I really enjoy when places combine seasonings with sauces. - Bourbon: Kentucky bourbon (with the alcohol boiled off of course) combined with soy sauce, brown sugar and other seasonings. This sauce was really good and tasted different from anything I've had before. This was in the \"hotter\" section of the menu, but the heat wasn't unbearable. - Tequila Lime: This sauce didn't impress me so much. It said it was supposed to be \"hot\", but I certainly didn't taste much of it. I'd pass on this one my next go-round. - That Spicy Peanut: One of my other favorite sauces. A good spice, tasted just like some pad thai from a Thai restaurant, but it could use even more of a peanut taste to make it better! -  Chupacabra: Interesting name, same with the sauce. This one wasn't very spicy, but I loved it. Sweet and smokey, but a bold flavor that I absolutely loved. I would've passed up on it had Hailey not recommended it. Thank you! - Coyote: This a dry rub \"sauce\" that I'm totally a fan of. The trick is to dip it in bleu cheese then use that bleu cheese to pick up more loose seasoning from the bottom of the container! So it's layers of flavor. Lol. - Chipotle: On the hotter side, it was quite delicious. Very peppery and while I thought it would've been a dry rub (confusing the name with \"Cajun\"), it's a nice, red sauce, letting you know to beware! You don't have to though, it's not THAT hot. - Atomic: Last but not least. Don't let the name fool you. I expected to be gasping for air, chugging milk and running outside to jump in the snow because of how hot it was. I barely blinked. It's a habanero based sauce, but it was not that bad, very good though, I would totally get it again.  Value: Absolutely good value here. The food was good and well worth the money, especially if you come on Wednesdays which is their #WingWednesday night! $0.50 wings, but you can't take any home with you, so they say... Beers are decently priced and there's no sticker shock looking at anything on the menu.  In conclusion I really enjoyed this place. It's definitely somewhere I'm going to frequent when I'm in Pittsburgh. I can't miss a Wing Wednesday! While you're up here make sure you go to the top of Merrimac Street and check out the incredible view of downtown Pittsburgh. You'll thank me.",

I haven't been here since before it was Bigham and it's a huge step up from what it once was many years ago.   Service only gets a 4 because we had to wait quite a long time before anyone came to our table. We were there around 4pm on a Saturday and the place was bustling! But not so busy that it should have taken that long. After we finally were attended to the server was pretty prompt with our drink refills.   I really wanted to try the mac & cheese but wasn't that hungry so opted for the BT (buffalo chicken) flatbread. My friends split the fried pickles and pulled pork poppers. Everything was very tasty although they forgot to put the celery and carrots with my order.   The executive chef came and chatted with us and even made us an order of fried rueben balls that weren't on the menu. They were heavenly. And he was so personable! And that definitely helped with the extra star.   This place seems like a really fun time at night. There were couples, friends, parties with children during the day, so seems like a good all around, inclusive, establishment.",

I had previously studied the pictures and reviews on Yelp and knew exactly what I wanted to order.  After our Yelp event ended we started off with more of the Candied & Jalapeno Bacon. OMG! So freakin' good! A must try!  Next we got a couple of orders of wings. The wings were a nice size, not real big (I don't mind big wings though) and not small. They were extremely juicy and full of flavor. Next time we come I will try to make it on a Wednesday as it is Wingsday and wings are 44 cents all day!  I also had to try one of the mac & cheeses and went with the Shorty Mac (smoked gouda, braised short ribs, peppercorn horseradish and scallions). It was EPIC!  We were asked multiple times by our sever if he could bring us anything or if we needed anything else and even our empty plates from each course were whisked away almost without us even noticing. Service was outstanding the entire evening.  Thank God I don't live near Bigham Tavern as I would be 300 pounds! It is one of my new favorite restaurants and is a must try for anyone who hasn't been!",

I still won't be returning here regardless.  I hope this helps someone !!   This is the second time I've had their southern tier 2xipa within 4 weeks and it's made me sick. That is my beer of choice when I'm out to dinner but I'm guessing their keg has gone bad.   I work at a brewery and have never ever felt the way I did after I've drank the 2xipa. Take the beer off the tap. I won't ever drink here again. Not worth it!",

We also had a chance to order items from the Bigham Tavern's regular menu.  You CANNOT go wrong with their wings!  We ordered the Hyena, Gnarly and Dingo wings.  All the wings were well prepared, perfectly cooked and the sauces were superb!   That Shorty Mac with beef short ribs, creamy smoked gouda and scallions was \"Smack Ya Momma\" good!  The only dish that just okay were the Pulled Pork Poppers.  The pork could have used more of a peppery bite and they were served somewhat lukewarm.  Add some more heat (both temperature and seasoning wise) and they will have a definite hit on their hands.  Additionally, the service was spectacular!   Friendly, knowledgeable and extremely attentive to our table.  Great service is not to be underestimated.  I would go back in a heartbeat and go with a designated driver, so that I don't accidentally roll down the hill after eating so much!",

    "text": "The Bigham Tavern is located on Mt Washington on Bigham Street. The place is easy to miss. The street sign off Virginia Ave is missing!  Once I found it there is street parking available along with a small stone parking lot. When you enter there is a sign that says \"seat yourself.\" Once I selected a booth I met a very nice waitress who showed me the two sided menu and since it was Wed, she said that wings were $.44 each. You can get a choice of various types of sauces ranging from mild to on fire hot sauce.  I saw my favorite French onion soup on the menu and asked about their lunchtime pairing. I was told you can pair any of the following: soup, basic salad, half a sandwich, or mac and cheese for $8.00  That sounded like a great deal so I ordered my soup and half of a Rachel. There are TV sets near every booth. The dining area is small however, they have a large rectangular bar area and I was told they have a back room for special events or parties.  I received my soup first upon request and it was delicious as always. My half Rachel came shortly after and it was just as good. My waitress was very nice and attentive to my needs. I told her how much I really enjoyed my meal and hope to bring my best friend here on a future visit. I asked her if this lunchtime special runs on weekends. She said it did and if I wanted it for dinner then it would be $1.00 more. The price is right for me so am looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "I chose Bigham Tavern for my birthday dinner spot. I've heard nothing but great things about the food and it's been on my bucket list for more than a year. I made a reservation a week in advance (good thing because the place was absolutely packed). The tavern is located in a residential area, that gives it a neighborhood hang-out feel. We arrived around 8pm and planned to have a few drinks at the bar, but there were no seats at the bar. Luckily they were able to seat us at the table earlier than I'd reserved it.   Everything was sloooowwww. We ordered drinks and two appetizers (pierogies and nachos) to kick off the meal. Drinks didn't come for almost 15 minutes. The appetizers took about 25 minutes. We asked for forks so we could eat the appetizers and the waitress never brought them. It took 15 minutes for our second round of drinks to appear from the bar. Our meals eventually came out, and we still did not have silverware... so we waited another 5 minutes for that before we could eat. It was so loud and crowded. You couldn't talk to anyone but the person sitting next you without yelling. From our seat we could see our waitress had to push through people at the bar just to get the drinks. So I can't totally blame her, even though she wasn't a ball of fire... it was easy to see where the logistics in this place are lacking.   The food was good. I had a dozen wings and loved them. Between us all, we also ordered the Taco-Mac (wayyy SPICY), the Fish Sandwich, Cheesesteak, and Fish Tacos. Everyone said they had a nice meal, but weren't really WOW-ed. I don't think you should ever wait over an hour for bar food. We'd planned on staying for drinks, but it took so long to get the first two rounds, we all just left. I think the loud atmosphere, lacking service, and slow kitchen really ruined any chances for an enjoyable celebration. Lesson learned.",

We also had onion rings as an app and they were good. I had the cheese steak and it was huge and delicious. The meat very tender. We  could've easily shared this sandwich. I had to forego almost all of my bun in order to be able to the meat.   Out server Dominic was awesome. Friendly and attentive but not too much.   Great place.

    "text": "The only things that went wrong with this visit were that I sent the French onion soup back because it was cold, and we also got the wrong pierogi app, but ate it anyway because it was delicious!   We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and ordered beer and wings with some apps. I can't remember what kind of wings we got, because all were not easy names to remember, but our waitress was kind enough to explain them all numerous times so we could decide. Mine were a little saucy, but hot, delicious, and came with celery and carrots. My husband tried one with a dry rub and thought they were juicy and decent-sized. The French onion soup I got that was cold, was quickly replaced with a hot one and was a little more sweet than salty. The broth was flavored good and the cheese had a nice melt to it the second time around. The pierogis were both of our favorites, I think. Super crispy but still soft in the middle- they were the perfect combination of textures and flavor. They weren't too crowded, but as we stayed and continued to drink, the crowd seemed to grow. If the weather was nicer, I would have liked to try the outside area, which looked nice. The bathrooms were clean and stocked and easy to find, by the entrance. We found parking on the street without much trouble. Looking forward to our next visit.",

Disappointing things I've had here: - Guacamole: it kinda tasted like bean dip more than guacamole?  - Margerita flat bread: I expected one of the long flat bread with fresh mozerrella and tomatoes. This was a thicker pita base and they had sauce and not very ripe half inch thick tomatoes on top smothered in shredded mozerella- I was hoping for something a little more light.

My loaded tots were also just ok. I was expecting a larger order of smaller tots with a bunch of toppings, but instead got four large tots with a little bit of topping and more toppings baked in. Like the burger they weren't bad, but weren't what I was hoping for taste wise.  This sounds negative for four stars but I've been here before and liked what I had and tasted what the rest of my group had and enjoyed that as well. So while I didn't love my own food, I know this place is good and I would return",

    "text": "I've lived in Mount Washington for about three years.  Bigham used to be my go to place up here on the Mountain.  They used to have the BEST brunch.  Whenever we would have visitors, Bigham would always be the next morning spot after a night out, to get some awesome brunch.  We even spent New Year's Eve at Bigham and they didn't disappoint. However, my last three visits have me convinced that they are headed in the wrong direction.  The first disappointing visit was during a Pen's game where they had a smaller menu of about five items.  My wife is vegetarian, so we couldn't even get anything she would enjoy.  We turned around a left.  I don't understand how you can have a full menu for New Year's Eve, but not for a Pen's game. Our second visit for was for brunch.  I ordered waffles.  The portion size was decreased dramatically, and the waffles were cold along with the syrup.  I gave it another shot today.  I got the grilled cheese cheeseburger.  I asked for it without tomatoes but the tomatoes were on the burger.  I also asked for a side of ranch, which never came.  And lastly I asked for curly fries, but was given regular fries which were very cold.  I asked for replacement fries, which they did give me, but it took another 7-10 minutes to get them.  At that point I wasn't hungry for them anymore.  The service was great, as Dominique is as good of a server as you can get.  I can't say I'll never be back, but I'm again disappointed with my experience for the third time in a row.",

Lot of fun, it's gotten so popular that they've added a heated tent to accommodate more fans.  There literally is well one bad seat in the house for a game.  Those aren't bad odds?  They have excellent bar food.  Highly recommend the chicken tenders but all there food looks tasty.  The DJ played your classic Steeler's Pittsburgh Polka, and 'Here we Go' songs during the commercials and was careful to bring the volume back so no one missed a play.  Bigham is also big on Thursday nights and check their calendar for events.  Cool alternative to the main drag on Mt. Washington.  It's 3 blocks off of Grand Street.  Check it out!",

    "text": "Let me first say that I love this place. The sandwiches are all amazing. The bread is so fresh and the serving size of the protein (burger, patty, lunchmeat etc) is huge and filling. The mac n cheese. Holy wow is it so creamy and cheesy! The fresh cut fries and house chips are always welcome sides for anything you can order.  Happy hour is 5-7 with $1 off drafts, $2 domestic bottles, $3 well drinks and I believe $5 house wine. There are a few $5 apps such as smaller portions of loaded fries and tots and a pizza. But they're still a good size to share or make a meal.  Wing night is Wednesday with $.66 wings (due to the national shortage). Coyote is by far the best dry rub. I will say though that the last few times I've gotten wings they've not been as Meaty. They also weren't dusted or sauced very thoroughly.   Street parking is found by the grace of god some nights and they do have a tiny lot attached to them. I highly recommend using the Nowait app, especially on wing nights",

My favorite apps are the cheese balls, gnarley flavored wings, and the pierogies.  The best main courses I have had are the buffalo chicken sandwich, cheesesteak, blue cheese burger, buffalo chicken quesadilla, and the crab cake sandwich.  They have the best buffalo chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh in my opinion and great ranch as well.  But you really cannot go wrong with anything you choose on the menu.    Every server and bartender I have ever had have always been very friendly and quick with our food and drinks.  My wife and I have on several occasions ended up sitting around for hours just talking to the staff and eating multiple meals here.    Recently it seems some of the food has been a little below their usual standards.  I'm not sure if they got a new cook or what the deal is.  My buffalo chicken sandwich last time was pathetic however.",

We complained and waitress brought out replacement meat. The replacement meat was much better. One person had a piece of grilled chicken over greens my daughter said there was really not much flavor and chicken a bit dry. Her husband ordered a brisket sandwich which was just Okay. Skimpy sandwich with too much cheese. Said it was more like a grilled cheese sandwich. Granddaughter did enjoy the Quesadilla and fries. Beer selection was ok. I saw this restaurant featured on a Cooking Channel show so we thought we would try. Probably won't return",

The place is split into the bar area and the restaurant area.  The restaurant is sort of hidden in a residential neighborhood but easy to spot as you walk or drive by. Parking seemed scarce, I did not see a parking lot from the side I approached.  I had the corn and shrimp chowder which was super tasty and the #1 BT burger. The burger was cooked just as requested and the bun was crisp and toasted as I like it. This burger was huge!!!  Unless you can unhinge your jaw you are not eating this in full bites. Sauce was tasty and so many flavors combine to really satisfy both appetite and taste.  I upgraded to the flavored curly fries, very tasty as well but we're the froze and deep fried instead of fresh made.  They also have a full mac and cheese section of various mac and cheese dishes, I would love to come back and try some!! I will definately be back!",

The best food I've had while eating there were the loaded fries, and the worst was probably the underwhelming fish tacos with the equally underwhelming sides of beans and rice. The loaded fries were really great and I highly recommend them if you're eating at Bigham.  Bar service has consistently been great, and I've had really good service and then mediocre service. The place isn't grimy, but it definitely is a bar...  Overall, Bigham Tavern is a good place for drinks and bar food. It's similar to a lot of other places and doesn't feel too special, but it could be considered an option if you're in the area.",

We had to wait a few moments to be seated which is understandable for a Friday night. Once seated we waited a bit for our waitress. She was rather dry & seemed disinterested in waiting on us. We ordered. Our wings came out & they were pretty good, I wouldn't call them award winning my any means. They were large which is a plus. Next our burgers came out. We ordered the burgers to be cooks medium, but we received more of a well done. Very very average burgers with little flavor. My boyfriend even order the Hangover Helper which is THE burger & said it was not impressive. All this time our waitress did not make an appearance at our table. She stopped by once we were finishing up to ask if we needed anything. We did need more water by this point. We waited about 5 more minutes & finally got water & a few moments later our check. Overall the experience  was average. If you live on this side of town, try it. If not, I would pass.",

I've been to Bigham Tavern a few times through the years, mostly as a result of living in the neighborhood and friends wanting a place to kick back. Half the times I've gone, the service has been just fine. The other half, the waitress has been either rude or has mixed up our order. On my most recent visit, the waitress was quite nice, albeit a little stressed out.  I've gone for quesadillas, I've gone for wraps, I've gone for tacos, and yes... I've gone for wings. The food is alright, certainly decent, but nothing I'd write home about. Even the wings. The beer list is also decent, but not nearly the best.  Maybe my experiences have just been a bad set of circumstances, but after giving it many chances, Bigham isn't my jam.",

I moved but still eat there as often as possible Let's start with appetizers....the loaded tots, pulled pork poppers and nachos are incredible. (I recommend nacho hill instead of regular sized nachos unless you have a group...they are massive) Next....entrees. The salads are great. I recommend the harvest salad with grilled shrimp. Everything is fresh and it is a good healthy selection.  The burgers are juicy and always come out cooked perfectly. The rodeo and bayou burgers are my favorite.   The wings are by far the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  So many flavors ...I recommend dingo,  BT original,  or if you want dry rub, coyote.  I have never had a bad food experience here. The beer selection and cocktails are wonderful ad well. The best part....the staff and owners.  I highly recommend stopping in. The only downside is parking during peak times,  but it's worth a little walk.",

The Sunday brunch Bloody Mary with \"meat stick\" is the perfect hangover hair of the dog, especially Kelly's version.   I can't recommend this place enough.

    "text": "The Mrs. and I went to Bigham Tavern tonight for dinner.  Our server was Brandi.  Off to a good start, menu looked good - some great options.  We put in an order of Pulled Pork Poppers as an appetizer.  We followed up with the #1 BT Burger and Bayou Burger.  So far so good.    After about 20-25 minutes and no sign of our waitress, someone from the kitchen brought out our burgers.  No appetizer.  Eventually we see our waitress 5 minutes later, we ask about the appetizer.  She says \"oh, that's my fault\".  She offers to comp the appetizer and have us take it to go.  She comes back later, says they will not comp the appetizer, and says \"hey, at least your food is good, right?\".  (That's fine if you won't comp the appetizer and just don't charge us for it, but please don't tell us you're going to do something and then not follow through (again), it's setting the wrong expectation with your customers.)    We finish up, ask for 2 to-go boxes.  She brings us one.  We finally get our check and leave our cash in the check holder booklet, only waiting 20 minutes again with no sign of her to take our payment (while other waitresses have walked by and cashed out several other customers).  When we get our change back, there's no actual change (which there should have been), only bills.  I likely would have left the change as part of the tip, but at least give me the option and don't outright take it.  I get the impression that once she realized she has made a mistake that she just flat out quit.  Her personality was fine when she was around - but this just spiraled from one mistake into a Murphy's Law of complete service failure.  No idea when or if we will return again.",

It's a great place fo karaoke (but they got rid of it - we hope they bring it back), to watch a game, or to get some wings.    The wings are probably the highlight of the menu.  Bigham has at least 20 different flavors of chicken wings.  The wings are always very nicely done, and are of decent size.  I've never experienced them overcooked or poorly done.  They're definitely some of the best wings I've ever had in Pittsburgh!  I recently also had a Pittsburgh salad (minus the fries) with grilled chicken - the restaurant offers that you can get any of your toppings (chicken, steak, et al.) tossed in any of their numerous wing sauces.  I ordered the grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and it was really tasty.  The chicken was nicely done, it was tender and juicy and falling apart.  The rest of salad was comprised of very fresh ingredients.    The only reason I'm not giving Bigham 4 stars - because the food is pretty good for a divey bar - is because their service is pretty inconsistent.  Some nights it's kind of poor and other nights it's good!  It's a mixed bag.  Basically, it is one of my favorite neighborhood spots and offers people a nice change from Shiloh Grill and Redbeard's.",

    "text": "Really liked! I got a build your own burger which was ok but i think if i would have gotten one listed that had a lot of fixings it would of been amazing. Mac and cheese was also good. Homemade potato chips were so good especially dipped in ranch. We had the pretzel sticks for an appetizer, the beer cheese dip was the best cheese dip i've had. The only thing is i'd suggest to not eat outside because the flies were quite annoying. There was a guy singing for the night, he wasn't good whatsoever. I found the food made up for the loud music and flies though. Good service too! Also the prices were really fair, like a side of homage chips was a dollar and the portion was big. I'll probably be back!",

We get halfway home (we live 20 minutes away), and the hostess called to tell us we got the wrong order. She said she would come and deliver our food and that was great... But brings me to my 1 star at the same time. Got our order at our door about an hour later.... Absolutely just a grilled cheese sandwich, no burger on there, along with my husbands chicken sandwich being a chicken tender cut in half placed on a bun with lettuce... No cheese. Please don't order out from here. Although trying to make it right was great.... Probably should have put a little effort into it because it wasn't our fault we picked up the wrong order. Had no idea this was like McDonald's and had to check the bag before we leave. Altogether, need a better system.. And if you mess something up the first time please try carefully the second time to get it correct. Won't be going here for a long time.",

    "text": "There were 5 of us that went to the Bigham yesterday for drinks and dinner. The food was great! I had the home made tots and Mediterranean pizza. Both were good I favored the tots. Our server was awesome she had a smile on her face the whole time. Great personality! I went to smoke outside and when I returned I had come to find out a joke they played on me. My daughter told the server she was putting the ketchup and mustard bottle in my purse while it was left open. Then our server (I wish I could remember her name) asked when I returned where did my ketchup bottle go as her eyes glanced at my purse. I wanted to die. My face got beet red as a removed it to place back on the table while I was saying I don't know how that got In there.. We all had a good laugh. Thanks for the hospitality and going along with a funny joke..love the Bigham!",

Unfortunately I still haven't tried the Mac n cheese but I have tried the brunch and I absolutely loved it.  Their brunch menu had so many different options it was difficult to decide. The first time I ended up getting the chili pierogie bowl. It seemed different so why not give it a whirl. I added jalapenos to mine and it was AMAZING. The second time I did the buffalo tots and some boneless wings. Both were delicious but I have a small complaint. There weren't more than 15 tots on the plate which was only disappointing because it seemed a bit pricey for the quantity. The quality was however not a issue.",

They had clean bathrooms, which is very important!  They claim that their wings are famous, but I disagree - Buffalo Wild Wings has better (and that's saying something)...   I ordered a medium cooked burger and I received a well-done burger - I felt bad sending it back, so I tried eating it. I gave up and I told the server it was over cooked (in my opinion). She took off 30% of the burger's price. I really appreciated that.   I won't be coming back, but it's worth a try - I'm sure their other dishes are great!",

Or a neighborhood bar. We went before a Stanley Cup playoff game - so we arrived 6:15pm and there was plenty of seating available.   Since it's finally getting warm outside, we decided to sit on the patio. They had plenty of tables and a big screen for the Pens game.   We ordered Blue Moons  to start - then we took advantage of the Happetizers (from 5-7 $5 apps) We ordered the Loaded Tots - I was so disappointed- there was literally 9 tots in an order. They tasted good though - they tasted like potato pancakes.   We also ordered the pretzels (follow twistburgh) for more pretzel reviews! They were okay - just your basic pretzel stick.. so I would try another appetizer next time.   For my entree, I ordered the Loaded Mac & Cheese. It's loaded with chicken and bacon - it was okay. Again, I think I would order something else next time. All of the macs come with a pretzel stick as a side. It wasn't the best Mac I've ever had.   Overall, this is good spot in the neighborhood- be warned there were some loud fans, but that's Pens fans for ya!",

I definitely felt the Sunday Funday vibes with the dark interior, loud music that was playing and people with carafes of mimosas (which looked delicious).  The menu has a bunch of breakfast versions of their food, like breakfast tacos, breakfast Mac and cheese and more.  The menu also included some more lunch type items such as salads and sandwiches,so there was a little something for everyone.  I ordered the shrimp and grits which was good but not great.  Other people I was with ordered the black and gold rogie bowl, basically loaded pirogues, and the big breakfast, which was huge!  The general consensus was that the food was great!  I would like to come back and try a different menu item and a mimosa carafe sometime!",

We were seated immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. They were patient when we took good amount of time to place the order since there were so many options with the wing sauces. In fact, they were kind enough to change our wing sauce order too when we decided to go with the popular choice on Yelp Honey habanero garlic sauce.   We ordered chicken wings with honey habanero garlic sauce and fish tacos served with chips on the side. chicken wings are juicy and unlike my previous experience, the central part of the meat is still juicy and flavorful. The skin is the best part since it soaks up most of the flavor from the sauce. Fish tacos was a pleasant surprise. The lightly fried cod was tasty and one full bite consisting of the fish with other side items was delicious.   I recommend trying this place if you are in the area. They serve some good bar type food.",

At first, it didn't look like we are going to be able to be seated since we had a large party and didn't make a reservation on trivia night. The girls at the hostess stand are amazing and were able to accommodate us without a reservation. I'm glad to know that they take reservations now too! Also, you're able to put yourself in line on the Yelp app, but our group was too big for that this time.  The trivia was fun but it was a bit hard to hear at certain tables in the restaurant. The food made up of the sound quality though! We had wings and really enjoyed them! We had the Black&Gold, and Honey Garlic Habanero. Everyone in our party claimed that these were two of the top wing sauces. Give them a shot!   This gem made me wish I lived up on Mt. Washington so that I could enjoy this place more often! I'll certainly be back with a reservation, and hopefully a better outcome with the trivia.",

Since Sunday was actual St Patrick's day and the college basketball championships were on, there was definitely a rowdy crowd! We put our name on the list and were told 30-40 minutes however we got a text saying our table was ready in 16 minutes. When we got there we decided to split 2 of the \"tavern favorites\" entrees. So we got the chicken and waffles as well as the breakfast Mac n Cheese. We also got 2 breakfast tacos to split as an appetizer (and we added avocado on them). The tacos came out first and they were very good. I could've just gotten a few more of those and been fine. When the entrees came I dug into the chicken and waffles first and it was great! The Mac n cheese was a little bit runny, as I think Mac n cheese should be gooey/cheesy and stringy. It was a more watery sauce which may have diluted the flavor a bit. I put some hot sauce on it to make it a little better but I only had it through about 4 bites anyways because I was full. My boyfriend wasn't very fond of the mac n cheese either but we weren't mad because we decided to try something new. I also can give them the benefit of the doubt and say the dish may have been a little off from having a kitchen that was backed up with orders. Either way we will be back to try more! We didn't get any drinks but everyone else's mimosas looked good. Next time we will!",

    "text": "A MUST READ BEFORE YOU CONSIDER THIS ESTABLISHMENT July 5, 2019.  Beginning at the restaurant, ordered a dozen wings, half honey habanero and the other half hot garlic but without the parmesan cheese (specified twice during ordering) and a \"hamburger hangover\", medium temp with the egg over medium with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. Bartender never wrote anything down and failed to make solid eye contact. Here's what we got. A charred and well done burger, egg cooked far past over medium to the point the yoke was solid, and cold, soggy, waffle fries.  Oh. The wings came out with parmesan cheese. Fair enough.  It's understandable that things happen and we requested that they drop another order of wings and hold the cheese. Decided not to make a big deal about the burger as we already requested to have something else sent back to the kitchen for corrections; would have been too much to complain about which would have made our experience unpleasant and we were not there to complain. Rather, we were looking to have a good, wholesome dining experience. So here's what was observed as happened next.  The waitress took the wings back to the kitchen and apparently somebody wiped off the cheese to the best of their ability and then sent the same 6 wings back out within a 45 second time frame. No way possible that there was enough time to drop another order as requested.  It was very evident that they wiped off the wings as several crumbles of the parmesan were still present on the returned wings as well as at the base of the unchanged wax paper lining of the basket. It appeared that the tender servicing us was at the end of their shift and could not care less about our quality of service.  In a nutshell, we did not find that wholesome restaurant experience we sought to achieve. Typically I would say something right at the establishment when I feel that there's something wrong with the service or food. If I'm paying for it, I would expect nothing less than what's being presented as deliverable. I opted not to speak up as (in other words, my wife didn't want me to make a scene).  So instead, we paid our $40 bill and left. It quickly became evident between the both of us that this was too much of a poor dining experience to not let the manager or owner know, not with any malicious intent or even to seek a refund.  Instead as awareness that we did not have a pleasurable experience.  So I decided to call.  I was able to get a hold of Joe (Owner) to let him know about our experience.  Joe immediately became defensive when I described to him that  took our wings back to the kitchen and wiped the cheese off the chicken wings stating that \"I know for a fact that my staff does not do that\" and \"I personally am at the line when the food comes out\" basically discrediting that this happened. I was actually taken aside by how Joe was responding in a condescending and arrogant fashion. Is Joe the owner? Great customer service begins with thoroughly listening to the customer and having empathy. Luckily, my wife's not lactose intolerant or allergic to cheese.   What if this had been a food allergy issue?  You could have caused serious health complications due to pure neglect and carelessness of the thoroughness of the customers' requests.  Joe continued to talk over me and discredit that we had a terrible experience at his restaurant. In fact, Joe made it out that I was a coward to not speak up while at the restaurant and he \"has a problem with the fact that I didn't come at him like a man\"....  Yes, this is from the owner.  I was patronized and antagonized for this repetitively during the phone call.  Arrogantly, Joe actually said verbatim: \"yea, ok... we are award winning.  Do you really think I'm going to listen to you guys?!\"  This is far below anything that I would ever have expected to hear from a BUSINESS OWNER.  Thumbs up, Joe.  You really represent your business with valor.   I told Joe that I would be more than happy to l come back to his restaurant so l we could continue to discuss the issues. Based on how The Owner was handling the situation, I felt that a refund was definitely due and I would be coming back to request this refund in person.  Instead, Joe actually stated that it wouldn't be a good idea that we ever come back.  Really?  And so I requested a refund over the phone and was arrogantly asked my entire name/number and actually was chuckled at a few times by Joe while he repeated my entire name out loud several times.  Poor, poor way to conduct your business, Joe!  You can keep the $40.  Food was terrible and, more importantly to note, the rhetoric and attitude of you, the business owner, is appalling and degrading.  Integrity starts from the top down and your ethics and morals definitely permeate down through your staff.   We will not be returning and hopefully the effort put forth in this review will sway future prospects from visiting your terrible establishment that you coin \"Award Winning\".",

Then we had it taken back and it seemed as if they put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and gave it back. Didn't eat it the 2nd time. Our wings very Luke warm and not very good either. 6 different food runners came to our table and asked if the food they had was ours so very disorganized. Waitress was very nice as well as the manager and they did comp our appetizer. However, very displeased with the whole experience. The only thing that was good was the beer and pierogies, maybe because it was NFL Sunday they were busy so didn't give us a quality product. I don't think I'll be going back.",

We started with the tickled pickles which were perfect and then he had the giant fish and house chips.  Another winner.  I had the Greek salad that was fresh, tasty and perfectly sized.  No anchovies was a bummer, though.  Service was pleasant and knowledgeable, but stretched a bit.  Atmosphere was lively and clientele was every age 1-100.  Ok. 1-75...  Liked the mix.  One missing star because we thought there could be a chance that the table or benches could simply collapse without notice - I kept a firm hold of my Angry Orchard.  Would definitely go back.  Much easier to fix a table than a menu + a happy staff makes or breaks a restaurant experience.  Next time wings!",

    "text": "I'm glad I was able to stop in here for lunch with a group of 9 while exploring the Mr. Washington area. Like the majority of the people we saw, my group took the lift up here to do a little exploring and see the awesome views of the city. The location of this restaurant isn't quite as convenient as a lot of other places, but if you feel like making the short hike past the line of all of the other restaurants in the area to come here, you won't be disappointed.  They easily accommodated our large group by pushing a couple of tables together, and we were quickly helped by a waitress who did a great job throughout our entire visit. They have a great selection of rotating beers on draft, including plenty of local selections. In bottles, they have an even better selection and even offer some specialty bombers that you can usually only find in nice beer stores. Being from out of town, it was nice that they made a big effort to highlight which of the breweries on their list were local, as I always try to drink local when traveling.  The menu is a mix of mostly appetizers, sandwiches/burgers, and wings. They also have some flatbreads, quesadillas, salads, and soups. Just reading the majority of the descriptions of the offerings might have actually contributed to blocking a few of my arteries, and it didn't take long to realize that healthy dining is not a priority here. If you like crazy foods that will force you to loosen you belt a notch or two, you'll fit right in here. I seriously considered getting the \"big ham\", which is a combination of baked ham, glazed ham, smoked ham, honey roasted ham, capicola, bacon, swiss, and dark mustard all served on a Kaiser bun. As tempting as that sounded, it seemed a little heavy for lunch. A plethora of other sandwiches followed a similar model with a big piles of ingredients that will please the pallet but knock a few years off the life expectancy. One person in our group was brave enough to get the grilled cheese cheeseburger, which is a half pound burger with both the top and bottom buns replaced by grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches.  I went with the wings, as they were advertised as \"undisputedly the best in the tri-state area.\" They were good. While I have nothing else to compare it to in Pittsburg, they probably wouldn't make the best of Indy, but would certainly be in the discussion for the top 5. The wings themselves are pretty traditional and a nice size for $10 a dozen, but the sauce options are where things really get interesting. I'd say there are around 25 or so options, and they cover about every flavor profile you could be looking for. Each is categorized on a 0-5 scale for heat, with just about every single on at 2.5 or less. I got the honey garlic habenero which was 1 of the only 3 options that was rated above a 3 on the heat scale, and it was a little disappointing heat-wise. The next step up from it was the atomic at a 5, so maybe a few more options between those would be nice. Their sweet BBQ sauce was good, and I wish I had the option to try a lot more as there were a lot of interesting flavors to choose. Coming here on Wednesday for their wing day with 44 wings is definitely a great deal.   Like I said earlier, our server did great during our visit by keeping drinks filled and getting us everything we need. She even brought out the kids food ASAP so they weren't getting too fidgety waiting for the whole large order to come out at once. The place definitely has a tavern feel to it with plenty of wood and a good number of TVs around the walls. If you are there before 2, at least on a Saturday, they also have a brunch menu but I did not even take a look at that. If I lived around here, I could definitely see this being a place I come to when I felt like I could handle a plethora of calories and fat, but would certainly be a go-to for good beer.",

I come with my girlfriend at least twice a month because it is close for both of us and they have a pretty great happy hour and some awesome specials (wing and taco night obviously). The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because of the hostess staff. We normally have a perfectly good server, but for some reason every time I come whoever is at the hostess stand is completely incompetent. I worked in restaurants for 5 years...I understand the difficulty of managing booth and patio requests, seating servers in turn etc. However, this hostess staff really seems to have a hard time with their job: consistently making the guest wait for no reason, having drawn out conversations in front of guests waiting to be sat. Once you get to your table...it's great! Don't let the hostesses incompetence deter you.",

The bar per se makes a great sports bar given the number of monitors, and there is a back room with more monitors.  I can only imagine a Steeler's game and how packed the place would be.  There is an outside area that would have a \"3 season\" run if/when they used outdoor heaters.  Lots of people from the nearby Chatham Village area appear to hang out after 4 pm or so.",

We live very close by, so it's a convenient spot for us and like I said, the food's always been good... if you don't often mind waiting over an hour for it to hit your table. Last night was wing night so I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but when we were sat there was no wait. Yes they were busy, but for chicken wings an 1 hour and 15 minutes is ridiculous. Nonetheless, we all worked in restaurants so we understood. What we didn't understand is why our waitress never once acknowledged us or the fact that our food took so long. She walked passed our table multiple times, avoiding us even to refill our drinks until we asked her if she knew how much longer it would be. She messed up our checks, and avoided the entire situation. After an hour and a half we asked for a box (at that point we weren't even hungry anymore) and she informed us a box was $5. The wings are only 44 cents! We had 6 left, which made the box more than the food. Again, I understand the reasoning but after she just saw her table wait over an hour for their food without even apologizing or even trying to come up with an excuse, she could have been a little nicer and handled it better. One night we went here for a drink and there were about 5 people in the bar, including 2 bartenders - both of whom were visibly, blatantly intoxicated. Unfortunately I'm not sure if we'd ever go back for food unless we ordered it as takeout (and I know we'd never go back for wing night!). Again - the food is great. One point. You'd just be better off getting it to go or when you have a whole night to waste being avoided by your server. Wish I could give a better review because it is so close. Hopefully the management can get some good servers in there to turn it around.",

    "text": "The food is good! There are so many places in Pittsburgh with a similar \"pub food\" menu, but Bigham Tavern stands above them. BT specializes in wings; they are the best in town. They have a long list of great sauces. You can take those same amazing sauces and add them to a quesadilla, grilled chicken sandwich, or even macaroni. The baked macaroni plates are excellent if you are hungry. They do a great brunch on the weekends, they have a great wing special on Wednesday and they often have live music. It is a great place to spend the evening with friends, watch a game, or just to get some simple but well prepared food. It is worth seeking out in Mt Washington. They also make good use of the \"No Wait\" app. My only critique is that it can get loud when it is a full house, but it's because they are good.",

    "text": "I've been here quite a few times in the past and it was always great. A few weeks ago we had a friend in town and were really excited to take her there for brunch. Unfortunately we had a really bad experience and probably won't return. It took over an hour an a half to get our food... When I asked our waitress if she knew how much longer it was going to be she said our order should be out very shortly. I had considered leaving money on the table for my drink and leaving, but since we had a friend in town and were starving and had already waited this long, what's another five mins. About 25 mins later and 2 tables that came in a good 45 mins after us being served, our food FINALLY came. My order was wrong and when the correct dish came out, it really wasn't that good. Some dry potatoes and an over easy egg that wasn't even dippy. Definitely not worth the money or the 2 1/2 hours we spent there.... Waiting. The manager comped our $8 app, (which the pierogies  were really good, maybe because we were so hungry.) But the manager never came over to our table to see what the problem was or to try and resolve the issue.",

    "text": "We have been here countless times and I can't believe I've never written a review.  The place is near perfect for what it is, which is a local bar with great drinks, great crowd, and great food. You won't find anything fancy here, nor trashy. You'll find a 20's-30's aged crowd mostly every single afternoon and night. The food isn't gourmet, nor should you be expecting that, but it is some of the best damn bar food you could ask for.  The wings are quite possibly the best in Pittsburgh for value, taste, and size. The sauces they concoct are totally original and simply delightful.  Try every flavor. The burger and sandwiches are enormous and carefully crafted. I personally am not a fan of their mac n cheese but other people don't seem to mind it.   It can get very, very crowded especially on wing night (wednesday, .50 cents), happy hour (m-f 5-7), Friday and Saturday night, or sporting events. The service is always stellar and everyone's super friendly. Just make the trip and check it out. You will not regret it. \"Go Bigham or Go Home\"",

    "text": "I write many reviews on here and very few are negative.  But this place earned it because the service was just that bad.  First time here was last night, as my son requested this as his last indulgence meal before he leaves for 4 months training in the USAF.  My husband just had back surgery a week ago and is using a walker now, but my son said there were no steps there so we thought were good to go!  We got there and we're told it was a45-60 minute wait.  We chose to stay and wait.  Thankfully it was a nice day so we were able to wait outside.  Our place in the queue jumped a few times.  Originally we were 15, at one point went to 7, back up to 8, down to 7 again, etc.  About an hour later we were told we were next and asked if we minded sitting at a high top table.  Umm, no, we have a guy using a walker.  So another party was seated first.  And there were open tables, so I was confused with that issue.  When we were seated, we were taken to the outside area that is covered with a tent.  It has metal garden tables.  They sat us at a small round metal table with 4 metal chairs.  I wanted to ask for another table but my husband said he'd be OK.  After the long wait he was just happy to sit.  When our waitress finally came over to take our drink order, we ordered everything.  She brought the drinks first.  Guessing that since we all got water we were not checked on often.  It was wing night, but tables were still open.  Two hours later we asked her for boxes for food.  We were told wings were dine in only so they threw 8 of the 12 wings I ordered away.  Usually we never have leftovers, but I did eat way to many nachos with pulled pork and I must say these are definitely the best nachos in town!  Also the best wings in town!  I hate giving bad reviews, but this wait staff seemed absolutely clueless when it came to dealing with a party with a handicapped person.  Nothing was done or asked to see if he was comfortable, and we were sat in the worst possible area.  We waited for the box for my daughters sandwich and the check to get picked up for a half hour.  I was so upset that I walked to the front register to pay it myself, where I waited for the hostess.  The hostess told me that our waitress still had to ring it up, so I still had to wait.  At this point I was beyond irritated and walked back to the table where I froze my butt off for another ten minutes or so, and my husband had since left with his walker to go back outside because he was in so much pain from sitting in a metal chair for two hours.    Based on the food alone I would give this place 5 stars, but until they educate their wait staff on customer service, they will stay a 2 in my book.  Best nachos, best wings, worst service.",

It was really really loud and the wait was pretty long for the simple things we got. The service was sub-par. I chose the black and gold 'rogie bowl because it was different and interesting. I ended up liking all the toppings that were on the peroxide, but I did not like the peroxide themselves. They seemed dried out or underdone or something, which was a disappointment. I also didn't feel like the place was kept up that well. I had to wipe my seat off before I sat down because it was left a mess and I did not very comfortable with the cleanliness of the bathroom. If I visit Pittsburgh again, I will not be visiting this place.",

    "text": "We came to Bigham Tavern on a Sunday for Brunch shortly before 1 pm.  It was football season and you could hear the roar of the crowded bar while waiting for a table.  They were chanting here we go Steelers here we go!   Then hoisting their various beverages in the air saluting their team.  Active drinking crowd for the time of day, especially since the Steelers didn't even play until 4:15, but they were entertaining to say the least.  We were finally seated in a back room area behind the bar.  They have a Sunday Funday menu with some cleverly named meals such as the Hangover Helper.  I also noticed a Bloody Mary special that I made a last minute decision to get.  Along with my drink I ordered the Wake and Bacon.  It came on Italian toast that I asked if it could be subbed for  wheat or something else.  Our server was supper friendly and suggested a wrap and that is how she likes them.  Convinced me.  I went with a spinach wrap.     The food was delivered quickly and everything tasted great.  The bacon was peppery and very rich, but in a good savory way.   The Bloody Mary hit the spot, and just hugged the favor of the wrap.  I really enjoyed our stop here, and would likely return if in Mount Washington.  If I lived close I could see myself hanging out here a lot.  Quite a happening neighborhood bar.",

You can only split flavors up by 6 wings, so I recommend going with friends or coming hungry because there are so many different types you'll want to try. We ordered the Dingo, Black and Gold, Coyote, and Honey Hobenaro. The Dingo was my favorite, with Black and Gold being a close second. The Dingo had a dry rub base but also traditional wing sauce layer on top that created a wonderfully unique flavor. Wings are a pretty good size with meat on the bone and a reasonable price. The staff is great and checks in often enough to make sure you have everything you need but not feel pressured if you want to relax and watch the Pens game while eating. I will definitely be coming back here!",

We were told there would be a 5 minute wait to be seated and and then another 15-20 minutes before we could order. I thought that was strange... but okay. There were also open tables open so I'm not sure why there was a wait to be seated.   About 10 minutes later we were seated. About 25 min after that, the manager (I'm guessing) asked if we've been waited on yet and we said no. A few minutes later, our waitress comes and takes our drink order. Drinks come out and a little while after that, she took our order. My friend ordered two breakfast tacos, and I ordered hummus with veggies and pita. It took over an hour for our food to come out. Our waitress was great though and kept checking in on us and kept apologizing that our order took so long.   Finally our food came out, and it was very good! My friend enjoyed her tacos too. Our waitress again apologized for the wait and comped our whole bill. She also gave us a $25 gift card for a future visit.   I guess Bigham 3 stars because our waitress was amazing and the food was delicious! But on the other hand, they really need to figure out some logistics. I've been to Bigham three times, and of those three times, I've had two experiences of my food taking over an hour to come out. It happened during my first visit there and that was 3 years ago.. so I don't know what needs to change, but something does...",

Fresh cut fries were ok , boneless wings were tasty as well. Small side salad was ok as well. Kinda shocked that the interior looked pretty worn out , booth seats were pretty worn out and looked bad. Floor had lots of places where the flirting was coming off in sheets. Other than it being Divey it was pretty good .",

The bartenders are always friendly, as well as the entire waitstaff.   The beer options are always rotating. They display the ever in a live screen. Nice touch. The bartenders will let you sample beers you're not familiar with.  Next on my agenda is to try a dessert dish. I usually go with dark dessert beers ( Porter's and stouts).  Sometimes you'll see the owner around and he'll get to know you, which is always appreciated at a business.   Parking is difficult. Walk if you can or try the little lot across the street or right next to the building. I usually street park, but I'm not always lucky.",

Parking is somewhat awful, they do have a little lot across the street but it was full. I ended up parking way up the street. The place was packed tonight. It's pretty loud inside. They had some drink specials which was nice. The service was very good. They have a large menu and prices are very reasonable. We started with the \"Tickled Pickles\" which were awesome. Despite the place being very crowded, our food arrived very quickly. I had the BBQ Pulled Pork. The sandwich was very good (complete with two more pickles atop it!) but the curly fries were kind of blah. They were starting trivia as we were leaving. Would definitely check this place out again.",

We ordered that as our appetizer. Sorry, I was just so excited about the mac n cheese that I just went straight to the good stuff for this review. The hot cheese balls had great flavor!

(I'm clearly channeling my inner Bob Ross) The food, service, and prices were all excellent.  We ordered salads, bacon Mac and cheese, sticky wings, and bacon salted caramel cheesecake.  All of which had tons of flavor and were very reasonably priced.  The menu was pretty extensive and diverse (with the exception that bacon was in most dishes), so there were a ton of options for anyone.  We also ordered a bottle of wine because they have half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays! We ordered the Pinot Noir, and it went perfectly with all the comfort food we had ordered.  Our waitress was very pleasant, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu items.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that they also had live entertainment playing mostly 90's soft rock songs....very well might I add.  I will certainly be coming back!",

Now we know why!!  We had original buffalo as well as the dry rub that was recommended. The wings were cooked to perfection and the flavors were very unique and very tasty.

They created an experience that made me want to come back again. The managers and waitstaff were very attentive and consummate hosts--always checking to see that our water glasses were filled and if we needed anything. I typically don't make it to Mt Washington often and the restaurant is so tucked away in a residential neighborhood that I doubt it would've fallen on my radar.

The macaroni and cheese dishes makes this a nice spot for a date.  The sandwich and burger selection is above average, although I think they try to do a little to much with the burgers, they could use a more traditional option.   The service and staff are very strong overall, they are friendly and timely.  Even when the bar is crowded they are properly staffed to serve all patrons.  Not something that can be said about many establishments.    My ONLY complaint is that the wings go from a 9/10 in the restaurant to VERY hit or miss when you get them carry out.  We used to get them every Sunday carryout but the quality has been very poor recently and I think sometimes I've even gotten wings that had been sitting out or re-sauced. It is very disappointing that the quality when getting carryout is so poor.  Also if you are a stickler for ranch / blue cheese - make sure you double check before you leave they are very forgetful.",

    "text": "\"Bigham Taven ain't too bad if yinz are lookin' for a bite on that hill above that there dah'tahn area.\"  Pittsburgh.  For whatever reason, this place just screams it (not in a bad way).  In what I personally think is one of the more barren culinary/bar landscapes in the city (Mt. Washington), Bigham provides a welcome escape for $0.44 cent wings, decent drafts and a non-pretentious atmosphere.  Speaking to wing night itself, do yourself a favor and make sure you explore the \"off-menu\" flavors.  Ask your server for a description, but more or less you have the option for three combo sauces (their base Coyote spice rub plus a BBQ, Hot or Butter Garlic) their Cluckin' Hot (hotter than Atomic) or the 5th flavor of the day (I swear it changes every time I ask, so that's what I'm naming it).  The wings themselves are good and it's easy to slide out of here with a dozen wings and two quality drafts for less than $20.  The only place Bigham falls short is the service.  Not exactly the most welcoming crowd to match their welcoming atmosphere and there always seems to be some service hiccups (i.e. table # mix-ups, slow service, taking orders multiple times, etc.).  While these detract from the experience a bit, they've never been enough to offset the otherwise good experience (and my craving for wings).",

Washington, I was very pleased and a little surprised when I discovered this little neighborhood gem tucked away on a side street. Three of us made the short trip for brunch and all enjoyed the fare that Bigham had to offer. I am normally a regular patron of the sweeter breakfast offerings, but I flipped the script and decided on a savory hash skillet with eggs, potatoes and sausage. Delicious! My husband and friend both had the pulled pork hash and both gave rave reviews. I was very impressed with the menu and the clean, cozy atmosphere. I plan to return for French toast and then another time for dinner. Their main focus is bacon and it is featured in many of their dishes. Consider me a fan!",

It is nothing fancy instead- there are some booths for dining, a nice patio, a big bar and a nice back room with darts. They have a decent beer selection, but I went for a pineapple & vodka instead. We ordered their tater tots with bacon, cheese and scallions as an appetizer. I was surprised when they came out- a small portion, but the quality was awesome. They were homemade- shredded potatoes mixed with the bacon, cheese and scallions and then fried. They were good- but pricey for the small portion we received.  Wing night was CROWDED. I highly recommend using the \"No Wait\" app and checking into the restaurant before you arrive, to cut down on your wait time. Luckily, we found some spots at the bar- so we didn't have to wait too long. I ordered some of the buffalo wings, as well as some type of sweet & spicy thai sauce. The wings were very good- the thai ones being my favorite. The buffalo were just like any other buffalo and I found the sauce to be too buttery- it didn't stick to the wings in the way I enjoy.  Overall, I like this place a lot. Really tasty and unique bar food.",

We ordered: Big hammy mac - if you love macaroni & cheese, you will love it! I can't wait to go back and try more. It has just the right amount of all the ingredients (meat & cheese & pasta).  The wings were also great! The sauces were finger-licking good, so definitely recommend those as well!   I really can't wait to go back!",

Get there a little early before it gets crowded. The wing sauces are amazing. On my to-try list are their burgers but I'm too hooked on the wings. Great drinks too and an awesome happy hour round out the greatness of BT.  I have since had their burgers and they were fantastic. Now I am torn when I go between wings and burgers!! Also I've always had good service from the wait staff and bar tenders. One of these I'll try the Mac and cheese if I can tear myself away from wings and burgers!",

    "text": "I went here for brunch recently. I was disappointed in this place. I had looked online at the company website to check out their brunch menu before going. When we arrived, the menu was different and several of the food options online were no longer offered. Unfortunately, all of the options (waffles, pancakes and the Monte Cristo) that stood out to me on the online menu were taken off the menu and \"could not be made\". When asked, the waitress checked with the kitchen staff and they said they could no longer make it. She also informed me that the menu was changed a month or so ago but obviously they never updated their website. This was a huge disappointment and the BT offered no more than an \"I'm sorry\".  I was also annoyed with the noise level of this place. I could barely hear my fellow brunch goer and we both spent the morning shouting at each other.  There were some good points: the home fries were delicious; the wait was quoted at 45-60 and in reality only ended up being 15; the Bloody Mary was great.",

Tucked off on Mt Washington this local restaurant is a True gem.The staff is very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is energetic! But what is a restaurant review without me talking about their FOOD!   A couple of frequent customers told me I couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu; which I undoubtedly believe, but it was the clever puns that described their homemade wing sauces that lured me in. Needless to say I was thoroughly pleased. So much so that when the waitress mentioned TRIVIA, I had to go back that same day for their trivia night. (It's on Thursdays)  The place was busy both times so larger parties be prepared for a potential wait.  There will certainly be something about the place that everyone in the group enjoys.",

    "text": "This is it. My new, way too good junk-but-high-quality-junk-food-place. The menu sticks to the basics--wings, mac and cheese, sandwiches, burgers--but executes them in really elevated ways.   Met a friend here to grab wings and beer. I'm not a wing person, really (not a fan of eating the skin,) but these I could eat a ton of. They're so good! Crispy on the outside, but not at all dry on the inside. Lots of flavors, many of which are doable for the spicy averse like me. There's one on the appetizer menu that is just heaven- grilled maple, bacon, bourbon wings with sea salt, cracked pepper, and scallions. (Icky Sticky Wings) YUM.  If that's not awesome enough, they also have an appetizer of candied bacon! 3 strips for the piglet, 6 for the hog, brought out on a small plate. No fuss, just perfect.  The beer selection is really good and changes seasonally. I got the Hoppy Blonde to start (which I was just so excited that they had a blonde ale, my hops hating brain ignored the hoppy part and ordered it anyway. Thankfully for me, it was just a hint of hops and not enough to make it unenjoyable.) i moved onto the Southern Tier 2xpresso, which I'm now going to look for all the time. So tasty.  But the real reason I needed to write this review was the Mac and Cheese because holy crap! So damn good. I got the Smokehouse, which is made with Gouda cheese (and if you've stumbled on any others of my reviews, you know Gouda is precious to me,) pulled pork, and a Memphis bbq sauce, topped with breadcrumbs, and a huge pretzel stick on the side. YOU GUYS. I want to go back immediately, but I know when I do, I'll be torn between ordering the Mac and Cheese and a pulled pork sandwich because the pork in the mac was so perfect, I needed more.   But since I'm planning on making this a regular haunt, I guess I can rotate that choice.",

What the new owners have done with the place is truly amazing. First, they've done a lot of renovations as well as added an outdoor patio space.  But more impressively, they have totally elevated the menu from typical bar food to something creative and unique! So many great choices, but I love the Rachel wrap, mac and cheese, Pittsburgher, black bean burger, homemade tots, and tickled pickles. But guys, they also do brunch now!! The Big Breakfast is the way to go, and the beer-mosa has been my choice for drinks.  Of course, how can I forget some of the best wings in the Burgh?! Make sure that you try the Coyote if you like dry rub.  We go here probably twice a week and I can't see myself ever stopping for as long as I live in the area. I will happily go here for a night of drinking but I also love to stop by with my family for dinner or brunch.",

First, the good:  wings were cooked to my liking, menu was interesting, drinks were good, and the place has a cool vibe with a giant bar area and nice tables.  The coyote flavor wings are fantastic.  5 star on that flavor of dry rub.  The bad:  my girlfriend had breakfast tacos and she said the eggs were like instant scrambled eggs and that the tacos weren't hot.  We also ordered pulled bacon and it was a big let down being slightly cold and not as good as regular crispy bacon.  All that being said I'd certainly go again to try more wings.  Also, we parked up the block and walked 200 yards down and had no issue with street parking.",

They have an extensive menu that covers all the apps you want when drinking (lightly or heavily) as well as heavy entres that can certainly put you in a food coma.  I ordered the Bayou Burger with a side of onion rings...and 'tickled pickles' because I can't resist deep fried pickles.  The burger was cooked perfectly and stuffed with jalapenos and pepper jack marrying the flavor with onion crisps and sriracha mayo on top. It had two fried pickles which I tossed on the burger and the bun was good too. All in all a good experience for my mouth.  That isn't the best part though. They have a pretty extensive beer menu from your lite garbage to your heavy IPAs and lagers- Throw in a few ciders, a nice wine menu and a weekly 12 draft rotation with TV's at every convenient angle and outdoor seating now...You have my new watering hole.  Only draw back is they charge for every addition of anything. .50 for sauce, .75 to add this, $1 to add that. They are not pricey overall, but add a few things to your meal here and there and you'll find yourself spending no less than $30 for a burger and a drink or two.",

I highly recommend visiting on a Wednesday for their wing night and half priced wine on Tuesday. They also offer some healthy items on the menu if you're not looking for full on heavy bar food. It's the best food on Mt. Washington off of Grandview.   As for brunch, they have a new menu that is the best; great drink selection as well.

The place has certainly changed since I was last here.    The hostess was a little unusual with her etiquette, being very passive and not very welcoming, but I wasn't going to let that ruin my spirits! The dining room was clean and had plenty of seating, with booths and tables. There are TVs in every view point, no matter where you are sitting. We were greeted by our server within a couple minutes.     The server was very friendly and was knowledgeable about the menu items and was able to give good advice on what to order for the wing flavors (there are over 30 to choose from!)I found the jackal flavor very good and the wings were nice and crispy. I had also ordered their buffaloaded tots. Can we say yum! They were crispy on the outside and when you bite into them you get a great taste of cheese and bacon! So good.    All week long they have amazing specials on drink and $5 apps during happy hour(which is 5-7pm Mon-Fri). They have 17 beers on tap and plenty of bottled beer(over 100). Every Tuesday they have acoustic music at 6/630pm. They also offer BBQ, build your own burgers, salads, all kinds of different Mac n cheese, flat beads and even tacos!     With the food being as tasty as it was and the service so attentive and pleasant, I will definitely be coming back to try more items! Definitely a thumbs up from me!",

It was late night (like 11, lol) and i remembered that bigham had a Wednesday wing night. I called to see how long it lasted and the host told me til 1am! how awesome.   We ended up going with our friend and having a nice time. First, we ordered chips and salsa. The salsa had to have been homemade. It was extremely fresh and delicious! The chips had a great lime taste to them and were also fresh.  Wings are 44 cents on Wednesday. You order them by 6 per flavor. I went with tequila lime and gnarley. I also ordered a side of fries. My friends also ordered wings (general tso) and one also ordered a cheesesteak.  The wings were great! Gnarley was an awesome flavor and was described in the menu as hot, garlic and sweet bbq. Tequila lime had the obvious plus a dash of hot sauce. The fries were fresh cut seasoned perfectly. Ranch was $1 but was great and it was a generous amount.  The only hiccup was that my friend asked for no cheese on cheesesteak (weird, huh) & it had cheese. They remade it and service was beyond friendly.    Other than that we completely enjoyed everything. I love late night food joints so no doubt we'll be back. That salsa is calling my name! They had an awesome menu. Check it out",

My friends and I came up the other night for the Pens game, about an hour early to find that they started doing their seating system differently.    We waited for 2 hours for a table. Meanwhile, for the first hour, half of the tables were open.  We were told the kitchen was backed up, which is fine, we just wanted to sit.  There was a large crowd and we were in the way of everyone.  Not to mention, after an hour or waiting, they seated a party of 2 and a party of 3 in two of the biggest seating areas they have.  They told us the number of our party size didn't matter... up until they ran out of seating.  Then it was \"oh, we don't have any room for a party that size now\".  Our group has come to this bar during several games and other wing nights just as busy in the past and we have never had any issues until this new arrangement they're doing.  We all agreed that we will be taking our business elsewhere for future games and events.",

I got the loaded mac and it was really good. It also came with a pretzel stick that is never anything to be upset about. My boyfriend got the wings and really liked them as well. The meal was good and the service was great!  The second time we went was for brunch. I got a sausage omelet with tomato, onion and American cheese. I was a little bit sad though because I couldn't find any of the cheese so I think it may have been left out. The potatoes were really good so I wasn't that upset about the cheese. Unfortunately, we were on a time crunch and the service was pretty slow. Our waitress was very nice but kept disappearing. Overall, I won't slight the place for some small bumps but I will probably stick to the mac n' cheese next time.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Bighams. It's our \"Go to\" bar for years now, but last night was a terrible experience. We shouldn't have to be jammed packed at the bar looking at tons of empty tables. I asked why it was like that and was told it was to help out the kitchen. I understand they don't want to get backed up, but at least let people sit and wait for hours. Some of our party left because they couldn't enjoy themselves. Thankfully I asked a gentleman who was sitting alone if we could join him and he couldn't have been more welcoming. If it wasn't for him, I'm not even sure when we would've gotten seated.   On a positive note, our server was super sweet and on top of things, which was much appreciated.   Unfortunately, I can't say I'll be back anytime soon if this is the new system of seating tables.",

Just got a Reuben to go and it was a handful of dry corned beef thrown in the middle of the bread, I could see the sauerkraut but it wasn't enough to taste it, and no dressing or cheese. Basically a ball of not great meat on dry toast for $9. Again, the wings my husband got were good...? He could eat wings all day every day, I like actual food... I've tried several sandwiches and they all haven't been very good. Hey they got good beer and wings tho!",

I need to start off by saying that, for the past few years, this is probably my most frequented neighborhood food joint. I order food at Bigham at least twice a month. I've had way more good than bad experiences here. I love the build your own burger, build your own Mac & Cheese, and build your own salads. The soups are good and the hummus is out of this world!   They have the second best wings in town and an extensive wing sauce list. It's definitely worth it to check this place out on Wednesday (wing night).   I've been here twice for brunch. Once on purpose and once by accident (I told myself I'd never go back for brunch but forgot brunch ran until 2pm on weekends) Both times it took well over an hour to get our food and food came out cold. A dry, crumbly, and cold waffle is not the best way to start your day. On the second brunch go around 1 out of 4 of us enjoyed what we ordered. So disappointing!   Service used to be absolutely amazing, but I've noticed that it's not quite as consistent as of late.",

The food and drink menus offer a wide variety of choices. Our waitress, Beverly,  was really sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. She was also very attentive. I had chicken tacos and my friends had perogies and a chicken wrap.The chicken tacos were very tasty and fresh. I liked the cilantro sauce. My friends enjoyed their food. I would love to come here again and try more menu items.",

I received a grilled chicken sandwich without cheese but the sauce was excellent. It turned out to be really good. The tacos were awesome.

The server didn't give a crap, never mind apologize. It was also uncomfortably loud. We couldn't hear each other speak then, and we can't hear anyone speak now.   How did the food taste? Who knows? We were too hangry to care.  (This was the first restaurant we went to in Pittsburgh. At that time they had just opened and they were lovely and friendly with delicious wings. We were super psyched to come back, but I don't think we'll make that mistake again.)",

    "text": "I've given this place so many chances. Over the last year and a half, I've hit my tolerance level with the service and food quality. The wings are pretty average and they should stop resting on the fact that they ever won an award for them.   I feel like BT is lacking the professionalism and focus it takes to run a joint of this size and with such a large menu. Whatever is going on in the kitchen is killing this place. No one is bothering to monitor the food they give to customers. When they do deliver food, it's usually not hot or even warm, but tasty enough for a Sunday brunch.  I've eaten here maybe 8 or so times. Hit or miss experiences...  1. They burned the hell out of my burger twice on the same order when I asked for medium-rare. The first attempt was BLACKENED, the retry was completely gray, well-done and dry. I rarely send back food, but learn how to cook a damn burger - it's easy. 2. I came in one night and was virtually ignored while trying to get the staff's attention so I could ask about getting some food. 3. Brunch this morning involved A LOT of long, blonde hairs wrapped around my bacon and fresh toast. The guy at the bar serving us was very apologetic and comped  everything but we were really grossed out.  I wonder how much food this place throws away after not charging customers...   Three strikes. Adios :(",

    "text": "I heard from several friends that Bigham has the best wings in Pittsburgh. I went here specifically for the wings and they did not disappoint. Although very delicious, another place holds the record in my book. I ordered the honey habanero wings, which sound like they'd be hella spicy, right? Nope, not at all. It's more sweet than anything. The sauce was more of a glaze as opposed to a wet sauce. For those sensitive to spice, you might be able to feel the heat. However, I couldn't taste any traces of habanero, which was ok for me. They still tasted pretty good and not like anything I've had before. To go with my wings, I had homemade chips which were what you'd expect, really. Crunchy, potato-y. Overall, cool bar with good food. I'll be back.",

My husband said that what he ordered was one of the best things he had ever eaten and the waitress brought one of the owners to our table and we all had a shot together. Not sure what it was but it was sweet and tangy,  tasted delicious and wasn't too strong. I highly recommend this place for the great people and delicious food.",

BT is a good neighborhood bar with friendly service and real good crispy wings.  A nice selection of beers on tap and about 20 wing flavors that are rated 1 to 5 on the menus heat index.  We had the BT Original and the Dingo.  Both were very good.  Neither are real hot or spicy but with a nice flavor and just a little kick.  If you like spicy you may want to go to the 3 or 4 on the heat index. I'm sure we will be back for Wingsday.",

    "text": "I have been to Bingham Tavern twice now, and both times had great food, drink, and merriment! The first time I visited BT was before the Guns n Roses concert, which I believe was a Tuesday afternoon. The place was not full by any means, but for a Tuesday at 3:00, definitely a decent bar crowd. My sister and I ordered the loaded fries and added pulled pork. A carnivorous, glutton's dream! We also ordered the Pittsburgh Steak salad, which was also super yummy. This trip however, as a pre game for the concert, was more of a drinking engagement, and our stayed drinks were filled by the friendly bar tender.   My second visit to BT was about a week ago, just prior to New Years. Just like myself, a lot of people must've had the week off because we were lucky to find a seat at 1:00 pm. Sarah was behind the bar, what a rockstar. Even with literally every seat taken up, she took her time with us and answered our questions about certain menu items. Obviously we could see it was busy, and she did give us the heads' up that the kitchen was crushed and the food might take awhile. ( I very much appreciate this prior to ordering so you can decide if you want to be patient or jet.) We ordered the pulled pork poppers, finally tried the wings, and an order of buffalo mac. Sarah kept us hydrated while we waited for our order, and the mood of the bar was festive and cheerful. Although the food took a little time to come out, everything was hot and fresh when it arrived and delicious!   The only negative I can say about BT is that the menu has so many delicious options, it is very hard to choose what to get. Next time I am in the burgh, I will be sure to stop back!",

When it's nice out, they have a killer outdoor area too which is a game changer for me. You always want to sit outside when it actually nice in Pittsburgh. The only bad thing about this place is the parking. There is a small lot and street parking so it can be a little rough.",

Last night we used the no wait app and we were seated about 45-50 minutes after putting in our reservation. I would recommend checking this app before you go because chances are there will be a wait. It was a Wednesday night & a Pen's playoff game but it is still impressive how crowded they get on a weeknight.   The atmosphere is your typical bar, nothing too special about it. They do have specials basically every night which is a bonus. We typically go for wing night, which I think is 40 cents/wing. The only bad thing I can say about Bigham is the service has been kind of slow everytime we've been there. But it's to be expected because of how busy they usually are.   Bigham's wings are seriously to die for. I have always loved wings and these have got to be some of my favorites! A few stand out flavors include: Gnarley, Honey Garlic Habanero, Hyenna, Hot Garlic, and Memphis Sweet. The wing list is so big, there is a flavor for everyone! If you are looking for some good wings, I would 100% recommend Bigham!",
