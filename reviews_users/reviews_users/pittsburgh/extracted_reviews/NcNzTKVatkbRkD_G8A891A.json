    "text": "Food: The menu offers both tapas and entrees.  We have been to Silk Elephant multiple times, and each time we ordered entrees with 1-2 tapas as appetizers.  The soups and entrees are ordered on a 1-10 spicy scale.  The mushroom soup and the Tom Kha are both superb.  The fresh rolls are a great vegetarian tapa/appetizer.  All entrees we've ordered, from curries to noodles are top notch.  We have yet to order dessert.  The portions are large enough to fill your belly and bring a little home for the next day.  There are plenty of vegetarian options, and the menu is huge in general.  Definitely something available for everyone.  Price: The prices are very reasonable.  With wine, an appetizer, two entrees and no dessert, two of us ate for just over $50.  Entrees, tapas, and soups are all fairly priced.  Drinks: Full bar available, good wine selections, and the tea is fantastic.  Atmosphere: Silk Elephant looks like a ritzy restaurant but feels comfortable.  A great place to take a date or your family.  The tables are a little too close together in areas.  The bathrooms are sparkling clean and the bar is nice.  The silverware is pretty cool too.  Service: The service is impeccable.  Our water glasses were re-filled, no exaggeration, 15-20 times each.  The wait staff checked on every course to see if we liked it or needed anything.  The food was delivered at a nice pace that gave us time for each portion but didn't have us eating dinner for 2 hours.  Our waitress spoke incredibly quietly though, so you may have to ask her to speak up if you get her.  (+): great service, very tasty food, a variety of choices, nice atmosphere  (-): some tables are too close together   Would I go back again? Absolutely.",

    "text": "I want to try this place again.  However, I will just say it- i HATE SMALL PLATES.  It makes it so expensive to try anything.  I just want to eat!  And all the good stuff seems to be put on small plates with tiny portions.  I know, i know- quality not quantity.  WHATEVER- I am hungry.    However, the flavors are right no, the menu is authentic, and the food seems great.  I have to go back because I ordered above my spice level last time, and didn't get to eat much of my dinner.  I just cried.  SO... I have learned my lesson and will try again.  Try the golangal soup. It is straight outer Thailand. Haven't tasted anything like it in USA.  IT WAS AMAZING.  AMAZING.  A great Thai option, slightly more expensive though.",

    "text": "Ordered carry-out from Silk Elephant last night and was not really impressed. We are new to Pittsburgh and have a lot of restaurants to try, so I think it will be quite a while before we give this place another shot.   We didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't really comment on service or decor very much. However, in general, we thought the food was overpriced, underspiced, and small portions for the price. We paid $35 for an order of spring rolls, panang curry and the traditional ginger entree.   Pros: Spring rolls were very good. Order was ready to be picked up in 15 minutes and was hot when I got it. Very nice service over the phone, repeated order back to me so they did't get it wrong.   Cons: The entree portions were small and there was very little protein in them - we both ordered beef and my husband's panang curry had like, two pieces of beef in it. For ~13-15 dollars an entree, I expect more protein. The spice levels here go from 1-10. We both like really spicy stuff, but also want it to be edible & since we didn't know this place, thought we would be safe - so we got a 7 and an 8. There was almost NO spice at all. We had to add sriracha and red pepper flakes at home to make it spicy. Finally, my dish was the \"traditional ginger\" dish - since there was ginger in the name, I expected it to taste like ginger. There were about 2 pieces of ginger and again, I added my own ground ginger from home to even make it have any ginger flavor.   I was really underwhelmed with this place, especially for the price. The local Thai take-out place we used to go to in Michigan had delicious entrees for $8-9 dollars each and were actually spiced appropriately. There has GOT to be better Thai food in Pittsburgh - now we just have to find it.",

You can adjust the spiciness on a 10 point scale ( we usually get 7) which is great. Definitely get at least some as it adds to the taste greatly. The pad see ew is the best I've had yet with a very goid balance between sweet and salty. If you happen to come by at lunch you'll also be treated with some sweet spring rolls which are excellent as well.  Their tapas are very tasty but I tend to stat away from them as you get a small proportion (IMO) Overall one of my favorite restaurants.",

The curry was delicious with decent amount of lamb. I asked for a 10 on the spicy scale, but it wasn't spicy at all. It tasted more sweet, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Overall, the food was good and the service was great. The presentation and ambiance was quite nice as well. My total bill came out to $28 (18% tip included).   I also tried the thai crab crown which was delicious. Not too oily.   I'm putting four stars because the curry wasn't spicy and lack of quantity.",

I ordered the Basil Fried Rice with shrimp for my main dish. The shrimp were soft and not firm. Seemed a little old to be honest. Not a lot of flavor to the rice, but kind of boring. My friend asked for extra sprouts for his soup (he was given a meager amount for such a large bowl of soup) and they said they would have to charge him a $1 more which I thought was in poor taste.",

I decided to try to make a meal out of appetizers (\"tapas,\" if you're a Prius driver,) and I just didn't really enjoy it that much.  The taro spring rolls and the fancy crab rangoons were good, if a bit small.  The chicken wrapped in pandanus leaves and the salmon dumplings were just not good at all.  The prices didn't match the portions, or the quality, either.    Silk Elephant, I wanted to visit you one last time before leaving this town for(hopefully)ever, and now I won't miss you anymore.

Not big enough to cause a strain on service, but two people were able to instantly get a table on a Friday at 7 o'clock.  Service: The service was excellent. In addition to your waiter/waitress they have other people to fill water, deliver/clear plates etc. Never once did I have to sit there wondering when I was going to be served.  Tapas: We got a couple of tapas just as an appetizer. They were delicious and reasonably priced for the amount of food.  Entrees: The entrees were phenomenal. We didn't use the number scale for spiciness since we had no point of reference, but my date ordered \"medium\" and I ordered \"hot.\" I LOVE very spicy food, so hot was perfect for me if not a fraction too spicy. If you are iffy about spice, stick to medium as your max.   (We had the Pad See Ew and Noodle Curry. I can't imagine myself getting anything but these two dishes when we go back. They were outstanding.)  This is my go to Thai place in Pittsburgh from now on.",

    "text": "I wish I could give it 4 and a half stars instead of just 4. But anyway.  This place has been around for a while now. I am surprised it was able to stay in business (considering how many other businesses have gone under on the same street.)  The food is really, really good. It's Thai but also sort of Malaysian or something. I am not 100% on that. But it's definitely Thai and maybe something else. There is a lot of seafood used in their dishes and same with fruit and spicy flavors. Whoever came up with a lot of the appetizers really knows how to blend flavors together, harmoniously.  To drink I always order either mango juice, Thai Iced Tea, or hot floral tea.  To eat, my favorite dish is the Siam Paragon. This is also my mom's favorite. (And I would like to point out that she does not even LIKE Thai food and she loves to eat here!) Their coconut rice is TO DIE FOR. It's SO tasty and sweet, almost like a dessert. I've also tried Haw Moork Fish, Salmon Rolls, Spring Rolls, and the Spicy Siam Mussels on the half shell. I am sure I've tried a few other of their tapas too but it's been a while so the names aren't coming to me as I type this. But basically, it's all really good. A lot of dishes have some spiciness to them so if you don't like spicy foods then you might wanna steer clear or play it safe and order something not so spicy like spring rolls or pad Thai.  I've had their Red Curry with chicken and their chicken Pad Thai. Both are really tasty. The mildest level for the red curry is still a little bit spicy, though.   The tapas are the best, though, and if you are undecided, try the Siam Paragon and the Spring Rolls with chicken (or veggies if you prefer.) Those are both tried & True dishes.   I've never really tried their alcoholic drinks so I can't comment on those, or the desserts.  I REALLY love their interior too. Easily one of the most \"romantic\" interiors in town, or at least in the Sq Hill area. The lighting, decor, and the waterfall by the door....all very nice for a night out!  Regarding the prices--pretty affordable if you order 3-4 appetizers and split among you and one other person or more. My mom and I spent about $35 total for the both of us including a tip for our meal, and we were pretty filled...two mango juices, coconut rice side order, siam paragon, mussels on the half shell, spring rolls, and salmon rolls.  The only reason why the Silk Elephant did not get 5/5 stars is due to the service. It can be really really REALLY slow in there sometimes, even when there aren't many other people eating there. Once you place your order, it seems to speed up a bit, though.",

I have tried Silk elephant ,Thai Place, Smiling Banana Leaf, and Bangkok Balcony. They all were good but Silk Elephant is my favorite so far.  My first experience with this place was a take out on a snowy night. I just craved Thai food and Yelped ( of course ! ) and came across Silk Elephant. I ordered Mixed vegetables with beef and that was it. Since then Silk Elephant is my to go Thai Place.  Dishes that I have tried:  Pad Thai : I order this with beef. very delicious. one of the best Pad Thai's I have had. generous portion.  Mixed vegetables : again I order it with beef , and rice. It comes with a delicious brown sauce and is one of my favorites. generous portion.  Red Curry : Perfect blend of flavors. regular portion.   They also have pretty good spring rolls.  Overall, service is great, food is quite decent, and price is pretty reasonable. Give it a shot if you are craving Thai!",

Wine was fantastic - they have a nice selection of 'by the glass' offerings, though the prices tend to be high (cheapest is $7 by the glass).  I really liked the salmon spring rolls and the larb salad with tofu - though I'll agree with some previous reviewers that portions are a bit small. I understand this is a tapas place, but salads should at least fill a salad plate.  bonus - the decorating and overall interior are cool and give a good vibe. I will def. return, however, some improvements in waitstaff are needed, though the busing and food running are spot-on. Our waitress barely saw us after the initial orders were taken, and didn't return until it was time for the check. She was nice, and helpful, but if she'd been more on top of things, we would have ordered a few more tapas instead of deciding to get the bill and go across the street for frozen yogurt instead.",

That said, I really hate the decor, furniture, tablecloths, and silverware of this place (ornate, stuffy, uncomfortable) and when not dining with a group, I will pick one of the other Thai restaurants on the street. With a different decor I would eat here all the time.",

    "text": "Blah! It's been a long time since I had a meal I disliked so vehemently. Thank you for reminding me what an awful dining experience is really like, Silk Elephant.  When I walked in I had such high hopes and even debated trying a few of the specials that were listed on the board by the front. One visit from our waitress later and I knew asking about the specials would get me nowhere - saying more than a few syllables confused her and someone from the bar actually came out to my table to confirm what my wine order was (Merlot) for her. So, determined to get food rather than waste time explaining the menu to the person who should have been able to tell me about the menu, I ordered a few basic items, sat back...and proceeded to sip on a really, really weak and bland glass of Merlot. Ick.  Waiting for the food I noticed just how loud everything was in here. They turned down the lights and lit candles to try to add some calming atmosphere to the place, but I have no idea why they bothered; every time a waitress even put silverware down you could hear it across the restaurant. This place is just noisy, because of the acoustics and because the items in it make incredible amounts of noise when clicked together.  And my food? Ugh! My horrible dumplings tasted like something you'd get from a box in the frozen food section of a cheap grocery store, and the soup was tasteless - LuLu's noodles has more flavor than my soup did. I want to note (and I hope the staff reads this), I may have asked that my food not be spicy, but guess what? Not spicy does not mean no flavor!   Horrible, horrible experience all around. I will not be back, not for drinks and certainly not for food.",

I am an event planner with <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMeetup.com&s=26b64e7bab324d27aa4b63dff07ddb356faa66945c651d3084df91876495534f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meetup.com</a>. I'm the main organizer for a group called Pittsburgh Dining N' At, and an assistant organizer for ten other Meetup groups. When I plan a dinner, I often cross-post the event on multiple Meetup groups, resulting in quite a few RSVPS. I have now been to Silk Elephant with a large group of people TWICE in 2013 on major holidays, and both times they did an outstanding job of accommodating our needs.  My group went there for dinner on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day 2013. Both times, the food was fantastic and the service was excellent. I asked for separate checks, which is not easy in a group of 18 people for Easter, and 12 people for Christmas dinner. The event planner and the wait staff went out of their way to help make these two dinners a huge success. Everyone had a great time and raved about their food. I look forward to going back again soon, since everything on the menu looks so good. I took a lot of pics of the food, so you can see for yourself the delicious food we enjoyed. I highly recommend Silk Elephant.",

Went for all Tapas because I liked the concept. Ordered 3 each - fried taro (ok), chicken skewers (oily), curry puff (very fried), salmon dumplings (never again), cream cheese rolls (so americanized) and the watercress seafood salad (felt like I can almost taste the tin from the can they poured it from).  Maybe I can blame myself for not reading the descriptions and realizing everything was deep fried. Or the heaviness of the cream cheese. Or because I'm Asian and actually just came back from Thailand last month and Asian food is supposed to be light. But both of us completely lost our appetite before the last two even came out.   I probably would have given a decent review if I had a standard curry or pad thai meal ... but not today. I finished that night with a cup-o-noodle ramen from giant eagle and a regrettable $50 bill.",

The dumplings were 3 for $3.99, and the dinners were priced at $14.99 and $16.99, respectively, which, for the portions, were ridiculous prices.  We got complimentary sticky rice rolls which were good, but that was about it.  I say go if you want something that's just a \"middle of the road\" dining experience.

Making them even more appealing was that they would deliver the food to my hotel on the waterfront . Yay! Right? That's not typical, and I willingly paid more to get chicken pad Thai, dumplings and Tom Kha soup for take out and delivery. Normally I would say that was the problem - because the food was cold and dry.   But aside from being cold and very dry, there wasn't a bay leaf or basil leaf or any really good Thai flavors in any of the food. The soup had so much lime in it - way overkill - that the coconut flavor was drowned out. The chicken was overcooked, hard and dry in all three dishes, and the dumplings were as hard as little boulders.   Usually I have to keep myself from polishing off my extra Thai food and disciplining myself to save some for later - especially pad Thai which is addictive done well. I'm not kidding when I say this was just dry, gloppy under seasoned noodles with peanuts and bean sprouts sprinkled on the side.   Maybe if I had actually gone into the restaurant it would have been a completely different story. But I won't. In fact it was so bad, I threw out 80% of it and only ate the three dumplings which weren't good either. $35 for bad takeout Thai food later, I'm wondering how they earned all these great Yelp ratings!

I got the pad see-u and while it was a little too oily, it didn't taste bad. I particularly enjoyed the spring rolls too. I'll definitely come back again for their lunch special and try something different from their extensive menu.     PS: for the spicy dishes, you get to choose your spicy-ness from a range of 1-10.",

    "text": "To be honest, the food here is mediocre. I have been a regular customer at silk elephant because of the good price and service. That was, before my worst dining experience ever. I went for an early dinner with two of my friends. The restaurant had three occupied tables other than ours and the waitresses were not busy at all. However, the waitress did not even care to sit us. When we were finally seated, she took more than ten minutes to bring the menu, and more than an hour to bring the food. We were sitting close by to where the chef puts the food for the waitresses to deliver, and we knew that the food that came out was ours. I had to tell the waitress myself more than once before she brought our food. Moreover, she seemed to love slamming silverware and water glasses on the table. Maybe it was her own performance, but I personally thought she was rude. While I was still eating my food, she tried to take it away from me as if telling me to leave. Maybe she was hungry too.  And I am not trying to be rude about her english, since I myself am not a native, but I really could not understand her. When I asked her to repeat herself, she had her second anger moment.  I felt that I was not welcome, and that I was mistreated because I seem young. I gave a small tip. When me and my friends walked out of the restaurant, the lady ran out and caught us telling us that she deserves a tip of 15~ 20%. Also, she told me and my friends never to come again. I want to thank her for her horrendous service and attitude, and that I will never go again :).",

The prices were regular (between $13 - $18 for an entree).  The seating is very tight and I felt like they were really making people squeeze into their narrow booths and chairs.

    "text": "3.5 stars  So it seems that I come here every year for my friend's annual birthday dinner - not that I have a problem with that! I always enjoy myself, though I found my most recent visit to be a little less impressive.  We came in a large group (of 10 or 12) and I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu, while sharing the Coconut Jasmine Rice and the Taro Crunch. During my first visit, the Taro Crunch was delicious, albeit a little lackluster this second time around. The Taro Crunch is comprised of ground taro root and coconut enveloped in a crispy outer shell (think phyllo dough). My Pad Thai also seemed like it was missing some punch. While it was tasty, there was nothing that particularly set it apart from the Pad Thai dishes I've had at other Thai restaurants. Last year when I'd ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu, I felt similarly - it just needed that extra lovin' touch! Surprisingly, the Coconut Jasmine Rice was really outstanding. I've been to a few places that have served the same side, but no one's gotten it quite as fluffy, and, well, COCONUT-Y, as Silk Elephant. Really good stuff!  The service here is really commendable. They're super efficient about refilling water (hey - if your dish rates a 9 on the Spice Richter Scale, you need that stuff, STAT!) and taking your order, all while being super polite. We hit a slight snafu the last time with not getting enough change back on the bill, which is sort of understandable with big parties (they fixed it ASAP).  Will definitely have to see how this place stacks up the next time I visit!",

Their red curry is dynamite, but, as mentioned in other reviews, their shiz is hot! I've taken it down to a 5/10 and it was still causing my eyes to water.

The food was really good and the fact that it was tapas made the experience even more fulfilling. It's fun to order food you're unfamiliar with but the prospect of getting an entire entree and not liking it is always a deterrent. With tapas you can order a bunch of little items and try everything your heart desires. It's especially fun when you're with a few people because you end up leaving the restaurant having sampled many many things. Everything we ordered was delicious and looked good. The plating and presentation was superb.  I'd definitely take a date here, it's a really impressive place that wont hit your wallet too hard. If you have a few friends that enjoy culinary adventure it would be fun to order a bunch of things and pass them around.",

It was hard to be sure that I was making a choice that I wasn't going to regret. We started off with some tapas.  I ordered the chicken spring rolls, which turned out to be better than I expected.  The shell was crispy and the fillings were savory.  Just about all of the tapas come with a dipping sauce on the side.  Mine was sweet and complimented the dish perfectly.    After a short period of time the main courses came.  I ordered the basil leaf with beef, sauteed green and red peppers and rice.  To make it easier on the newcomers, the wait staff will ask you how spicy you would like your food to be.  You should choose carefully.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I ordered a 4 and it was plenty hot for me, any higher than that and I would have been pushing my comfort level.  Overall the food was very delicious, the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "4 stars for the pumpkin curry with tofu, 3 stars overall.  The boyfriend and I eat a lot of Thai food, and we usually opt for Thai Place or Bangkok Balcony (or, recently, Kanok).  We decided to check out Silk Elephant after a rave review from a friend.  I made reservations for Friday at 8PM, which was a good call.  The restaurant was packed and we still had to wait for a table, which was slightly annoying because there really is no lobby, especially when multiple other people are waiting.  I wasn't a huge fan of the seating; I hate being too close to the table next to me. But once we sat down, the night started improving.  Our drink orders were taken and filled quickly. We ordered the fresh rolls and they came out almost immediately, which shows how popular they are.  The peanut sauce for the rolls was delicious.  I ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu (on special) and he ordered the pad thai with tofu.  I liked the 1-10 spice scale and felt the dishes were seasoned correctly.  My only slight issue with the dish was that the tofu was grilled well done (it's possible, believe me!), which upset the balance of the soft pumpkin and curry.    The portions were perfect for the price.  I would return and try some of the other tapas, but probably on a quieter night.",

The food took about 20 minutes to come out.  The waitress brought both the appetizer and entrees together.  The appetizer sat under the heat lamp during most of the time.  I kept watching it up there but was hoping it was for a delivery. The food was overpriced for the very, small appetizer portions.  The servers never checked back on us, did not pre-bus our table, and we had to ask for our credit card back.",

We ordered the Chicken Papaya Salad and another chicken dish with broad noodles (the name escapes me). Both dishes had a rubber chicken that was definitely reheated. The Papaya dish had big cuts of chicken which made the reheated chicken so dry that it was barely palatable. I also found a hair in it which ruined any redeeming qualities the dish had. The salad was soggy and had brown lettuce. The server and hostess both had something going on that was distracting them. Maybe it was an off day or there was something going on in the kitchen. Just know that this place was a bad choice. I'd say maybe next time, but it was bad enough to lose my business permanently.",

They are open till 3 pm unlike other lunch places. This helps me grab late lunches that are difficult to get on Craig St. The ambience is great and is usually pretty quiet in the afternoons.

Started with the Fresh Rolls, comes two per order, stuffed with fresh tofu, rice noodles, carrots, lettuce, mint, basil, etc., served with a sweet brown sauce topped with peanuts. Delicious, huge, and oh so fresh! They were chock-full of incredibly fresh ingredients, and even the sweet sauce and the fresh peanuts added so much additional flavor. Light app but also so filling. For my entree I got the Pad See Ew with vegetables, made vegan by omitting the egg and fish sauce. It was truly out of this world. One of the best Pad See Ew's I've ever eaten - the flavor was bursting, the noodles were so broad and fresh, 8/10 spice level was perfectly spicy but not too overwhelming, and it was loaded with so many veggies. Not one thing I would have changed. Asked for some extra chili sauce on the side which I only had to use with the spring rolls, as my noodles were perfectly seasoned. Cannot wait to come back and try some additional entrees.",

My personal favorite is the Pad See Ew which has great flavor and packs a punch.   I would say that the portions for dinner are not worth it and that you should come for the lunch specials which has a smaller selection but provides much more value as you get soup and spring rolls along with your dish at a discounted price!!  Despite all of this, the service is below par. It's your average service but I got into a small argument with the waitresses previously. My party and I had ordered 4 dishes but the waitress misheard the order and gave us an extra dish which, after some arguing, we were forced to keep and pay for. Since then they have neglected taking my party's orders in a timely manner and held off on doing so for quite some time.   I still come for the lunch specials when I'm craving some Thai food but the waitresses evidently hold a grudge and it makes my experience here much worse.",

The timing was very off...our server brought our apps and immediately started bringing over our dinner entrees. Not enough time between courses.  Annoyingly enough, half our entrees came out and the other half trickled in over the next half hour so by time we got our fried rice the red curry we had ordered to pair with it was already cold. The server was kind but pretty inattentive and unapologetic about everything.   The food is nothing special and the service only makes it worse.

The service was also good - polite and attentive. I would recommend it to anyone.",

This is probably my favorite Thai place in Pgh to go to. The tapas I usually order as an appetizer because they are kind of small...but still really tasty. When my husband and I go, we usually end up getting an actual dish versus just going there for True tapas. Our faves are the red and panang curry, the red curry noodles, and the curry chicken rice. All in all pretty affordable for the quality of food you are getting. Also, if you want spicy...just tell them...I have found that the curries are spicier on their number scale in comparison to a rice dish...so just keep that in mind. Enjoy!",

    "text": "This is a good spot that I  just happened to stumble upon on a Sunday  afternoon because of an open parking spot.  It's located in Squirrel Hillwhere \"Zyng asian grille\" used to be.  This is a much better choice than the TGIF of asian food like Zyng.  The atmosphere is colorful and warm.  The ceilings are high and the seating is plentiful.  I sat at the bar, which has a nice plasma and a better than average wine selection.  The menu is big and I think thai food is a good choice to be served tapas style.  I ordered a glass of chardonnay to start which tasted fine and wasn't too overpriced, however the bartender poured what must have been only a 3 oz. pour.  The wine comes in cocktail glasses, so perhaps it was an optical illusion that I misinterpreted.  Nevertheless, I mentioned it before I ordered another glass and was given your customary 6 oz.  I started with a delicious pork and seafood dumpling, which was really tasty and almost as good as Nicky's thai in Verona.  Next I tried the chili pepper scallops, which were cooked perfectly, but lacked much spice for what was advertised as a spicy dish.  In addition, I'd have preferred one or two big scallops instead of four little scallops.  Last I tried the calamari, which were served with an interesting guacomole sauce, however the calamari and breading were flavorless and not delicate at all.  They looked like onion rings, but weren't as good.  The prices are okay, but this is definitely on the higher end of thai food costs.  Overall, good place with an interesting concept that I'll visit again.",

My favorites were the seafood dumplings, wild curry, noodle curry, and panang curry.   The ambiance is really great and it felt like a fancy restaurant without the exorbitant cost that typically comes with restaurants that have the feel that Silk Elephant does.

I'll start of with restricting myself to Forbes and Murray. Look for those reviews in the coming weeks!  The pad thai here at Silk Elephant was delicious. I'm not a pad thai snob just yet, so I may be wrong. But I do know good food when I see it. And this, was good.   It had a nice tang to it that in my opinion is often missing from pad thai. The noodles had just the slightest bite to them so that they were not mushy, which is another pad peeve of mine.   There was a generous topping of peanuts and a slice of lime to adjust the flavor with to your liking. I also ordered it gluten free, which in theory pad thai is anyway. The person taking my take out call was actually extremely friendly and helpful regarding this restrictive aspect of my current diet.   So, in short, I'd go back for another!",

It was a great experience and I could not thank my friend more for introducing me to silk elephant flavors.   We ordered corn fritters, basil fried rice, red curry and Kee Mao. It was appropriate quantity of food for four people and the prices are in a reasonable range.   Corn fritters looked like a simple yet tasty dish. That was a very good start to our main course. I will give basil fried rice the highest rating followed by Kee Mao and the red curry. Basil fried rice is not too spicy and not too bland. It is a plate of rice filled with amazing flavors. Kee Mao tasted as good as the one I had at other popular Thai place is Pittsburgh. It is big flat tasty  rice noodles. Red curry is like any typical curry that you would find in a Thai restaurant. It has coconut flavour along with other curry spices.   I will definitely go back and I added this to my list of hearty meal restaurants that I can frequently visit.",

It had a terrible taste, was drowned in sauce, with barely-cooked broccoli & hardly any cabbage or carrots. But the main reason for my review is that somebody in charge needs to tell the wait staff to never take it upon themselves to offer one person's appetizer to the whole table. Melanie brought my fresh roll appetizer, set it in the middle of the table and put plates down in front of each person. I certainly would have graciously offered my party members to have a taste of my order, but it was mine to give away, not hers. Meanwhile, the rolls were so poorly wrapped & cut, all the insides fell out the bottom when I (we) lifted them off the serving plate.",

We moved away from Squirrel Hill and first time back in several years. The food is still good, but, at least on the night we were there, the place was overrun with take-out orders. The room was less than half full, but our party of five waited for over an hour to get any food. Which then arrived haphazardly. The soup was ice cold; an appetizer arrived after the entrees, etc. We would have ordered more drinks, but the server was AWOL the entire hour. She was too busy boxing and bagging for the stream of delivery service guys. This is an ugly phenomenon we've experienced in other small ethnic restaurants with the explosion of delivery services.  Maybe they should unload the expense of the in-house dining area since the diners there seemed to be an unwelcome and annoying distraction.",

It's not that it is that fancy, but it has an upscale and intimate vibe that I love.  The service is also spot on, and you will never feel ignored throughout your meal.  Water is instantly filled, and the servers really want to make sure you have a nice meal.  Let's get to what really matters, the food and drink.  I started my meal with a green tea mojito, which was interesting.  It was not my favorite drink ever, but it was a cool idea.  My friend ordered something that was like...Ole Mrs. Johnson.  It was delicious.  The drink prices were not bad for off-the-beaten-path cocktails.  After our drinks, we decided to get the Taro Crunch appetizer ($4.50).  It was taro deep-fried in a black sesame seed batter and came with sweet and sour sauce with peanuts.  It was different and good.  For my meal, I got Pad Thai ($13.99) at a spice level of 3.  It was a bit mild for my taste so I probably should have gone with a five or six, but it was good.  The portions were huge, and the prices were a little high but not terrible.  All in all, this isn't a quick and cheap Thai, but it is a nice dinner out.",

If I had asked for vegetable and tofu fried rice I would say it was wonderful. But that isn't what I asked for.  I asked for vegetable and tofu CURRY fried rice. There was not one pinch of curry flavor in it. I also asked for 5 out of 10 spice. I got a whopping 0 out of 10 spice.  Now let's talk the veggies. Most were good and normal. But they included tomatoes, which I found a bit strange, but tolerable, and on top they placed cucumbers. Cucumbers? Hot cucumbers? Very odd. Not a deal breaker. I just picked them off.   And of course the order took about an hour longer than quoted, again. But I was prepared for that this time.   I won't be giving this place another shot. It's a shame because I do see the potential, but they don't seem to be getting the service side down.",

We thought the salmon roll was good and I enjoyed my Pad See Ew. The duck curry was sweeter than expected, probably because it had more coconut than other places. They ask for spicy levels from 1-10 and I asked for my Pad See Ew to be 7/10 but when it arrived it was 0/10 which was a bummer but they did provide hot sauce on the side.    Overall, it was a good experience and the cost wasn't too crazy considering the restaurant did give off a fancy vibe. I would come back.",

Small portions are not a problem when they are appropriately priced. But when I ordered a calamari plate, I expected a little more than the 5 onion ring-sized slices of breaded squid and a dipping sauce.   That said, the food was very good. Their pad kee mow was among the best I've had and I definitely enjoyed the calamari. Their wine list was solid, though not amazing. All in all, a reasonably enjoyable meal that cost far too much. I won't be going back.",

The service and decore was OK- not the greatest place or as nice as I expected from their website, and our waitress was prompt but didn't refill our drinks.  I had their shrimp pad thai, which was one of the better pad thais I've had in Pittsburgh. There was enough to take home for lunch, so the price wasn't too bad since it was a decent portion. My wife had the steamy mussels, which were good, but she got sick on them later which was bad.  The menu is expansive with lots of tapas available, and while I didn't try anything else, the food I saw at the table nearby looked good. I'm giving this restaurant the benefit of the doubt that it is usually better- everyone I talked to raved about it before we went. I would go there again if I was in the area and wanted Thai food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop there.",

Salmon rolls - probably our favorite 5.  crab crowns - eh.  tasty, but more for the fried cream cheese in wonton concept, rather than due to any crab meat in the dish per se 6.  Some dumpling - can't remember, reminds me of siu mai from dim sum.  It was good, but nothing extraordinary 7.  Siam Paragon - save your money with this one.  It's not that great.

On my first visit, I had a martini made with some of the lemongrass-infused vodka. Last night, I had the Biddle, a remix of the margarita including Cynar (artichoke bitters) and Thai chili.

The veggie offerings were all delicious, although there were not too many to chose from. Actually, I think that is a blessing in disguise because too many choices among delicious little tapas makes for some tough decision making.   The atmosphere was elegant, the lighting was romantic, and the staff was attentive without being intrusive. We held hands over the table, and played footsie underneath, and ambled into the warm summer night satisfied with our food & drink.   The prices are pretentious, like the presentation, but it's difficult to say it's not justified with the atmosphere & attention to detail. It's something I need to drop cash on like, once a year.",

All rather disappointing, especially the satay bef which looked and tasted like ground meat reconstituted to look like slices.  And while I'm NOT a fan of the over-sized portions most Pgh restaurants serve, the tapas servings were VERY skimpy.    My wife's Pad Thai was all right, but nothing special.    The food seemed more \"fast food\" Asian than fine dining.  And the prices are just too high for the level of food quality and quantity.  The service was good, except for our seating.  When we arrived, the place was nearly empty.  We were seated at a two-top RIGHT NEXT to the ONLY OTHER couple in the restaurant.  Yea, I could have asked for other seating, but, at the time we were seated, I didn't care.  The couple next to us, however, seemed to be right out of SNL's \"Loud Family\" sketch.",

There were three to four BUGS (some fruitflies, some bigger sorts) flying around the table during our meal. They were occasionally landing on our food and constantly bothering us. We complained to the waiter, who was helpful until this point, and he simply moved us to a table a few feet away from the original table. Uh.. what? Fruitflies FLY. Thinking it might be normal occurrence that moving to a new seat takes care of, we tried to concentrate on our meal again only to be bothered by these bugs. We called our waiter, who called his manager over. The manager said he couldn't do much - he could either give us one free take out dish or a gift certificate to come back some time. Well, both didn't seem to be great options because I didn't want to come back here and use the gift certificate and I did not want to get take out because who knows if there are bugs in the kitchen?  To be honest, they didn't even seem interested that there were even bugs in the first place. They didn't even make an effort to see if there were. The bugs landed on our food at least three times. I was not going to eat their food again knowing that there were bugs at the place. Anyway, good food but very disappointing dining experience.",

You get a mini salad/soup/spring roll with your lunch order.  The service was also pretty bad. Our server was extremely unfriendly and rude, especially when taking our order.

Something we ordered never came though it wasn't on our bill so no problem I guess. They have a full bar which is nice. They gave us a lunch menu that said \"Monday-Friday\" but later said they do it everyday. For $8.50, you get a spring roll, salad (the word \"salad\" is a bit generous for what you get) and an entree. It's a great deal. The pineapple curry I had was fantastic, one of the best curries I've had in Pittsburgh. I did order a 7/10 spice level and you probably could've told me it was a 0/10 and I would not have questioned it. It was still really good. Overall, worth checking out.",

We couldn't find it and when we did it was a little confusing on if we were in the right restaurant or not but we eventually figured it out.       We were met by the hostess and we said we would just go to their bar.  It wasn't too busy and nobody was at he bar.  It was a smaller bar but it wasn't bad.  They had a few beers on tap and a rather large display of liqueur that looked good.  We decided to go with beer.  We usually get wide noodles in restaurants like this so that's what we ordered.  I specially got the Pad See Ew and we ordered fresh summer rolls too.  The summer rolls were good.  When we ordered our main dishes they asked what spiciness we wanted.  It's so hard to figure it out what spice level you want when you have never been to the restaurant before.  The spice levels vary so much.  My wife got a 9 and I did 7.       Our food came out shortly after and it looked really good.  My broccoli was good.  The noodles were  nice and tender and my chicken was perfect.  I was hungry and I ate all of it so fast.  The problem was that it was not spicy and honestly the flavor just wasn't there.  It wasn't dry so there was sauce on my noodles but there wasn't too much flavor.  I'm hoping that this wasn't normal.  My wife said the same thing.  She got a 9 and it wasn't spicy and she felt the sauce was bland too.  The noodles and chicken were how I like my Thai food but the flavor just wasn't there unfortunately.  Overall we got good service and this has a lot of potential if the sauce was just anomaly tonight for us.",

I do get to Squirrel Hill now about once a month and it's so nice to revisit my old stomping grounds and fave spots. Silk Elephant is an excellent source when you have a Thai craving. The pad thai is some of the best in the city as is the pumpkin curry with grilled chicken. In addition, they have a nice tapas menu. The pesto and brie crostini is really yummy.

I have had several appetizers and never disappointed.The beer and wine selection is great. Silk Elephant is an average Thai restaurant, nothing unique in the food variety.   However the thing that makes the restaurant is the atmosphere. The lighting and the set up is very pleasant and comfortable for evening dinners with friends - this is what stands out and I like most about this spot.   But I must say if you go here on a busy weekend night like I did this past Saturday - the waitresses are very cold and super unfriendly. They had disgusted looks on their faces and our waitress barely came to our table twice. My friend asked the waitress the difference on the Thai beers offered and the waitress simply shrugged and gave a dirty look. We were never asked if we needed more beverages or how the food was. The prior time I was here I had great service. I don't know what it is but this last time made me not want to come back. Their service is quite poor under pressure - which should be expected in the area on weekends. I actually heard the manager apologizing to several tables around us for the service...",

I've never been here before, so I was excited to see what this place is all about.   The interior is lovely. There is a beautiful Buddha on the wall and there are fluorescent orange lights. In the back, there are pretty photographs and paintings too. The restroom is very clean.   Our server was kind and knowledgeable about the menu. We decided to order a bunch of tapas first since that seems to be their specialty. My dad and grandma got dumplings, my aunt got a peanut papaya salad, my mom got the Silk Elephant rolls, and my sister and I shared calamari, crispy rice cakes, and the fresh rolls. My favorite tapas were the salad and the fresh rolls. The peanut sauce with the fresh rolls was wonderful, and the salad had lots of peanutty flavor. However, I was not big on the crispy rice cakes or calamari. They were kind of bland. But overall, the tapas were great!  For dinner, I had the pad see eu with shrimp and vegetables. I got a spicy level of 15 because I have a very high tolerance for spice (I've eaten 20 ghost peppers raw and had no reaction!) The normal spice scale is 1-10 though. If you want higher, you have to ask. The pad see eu was good, but I could not taste the spice! I'll just ask for more spice next time, no worries ;)   My experience at Silk Elephant was terrific. My family enjoyed their meals too and said all good things about this restaurant. I will be coming back to Silk Elephant! :)",

    "text": "We stopped at Silk Elephant this past week.  We absolutely love Thai food and are always up for eating it so when I had mentioned going out to Hidden Harbor for some birthday drinks we decided to look into trying another local Thai place which led us here located only about a block or so away.  The inside is nice and spacious.  They also have a full bar which isn't common in most Thai restaurants in the city.  We sat at the bar and ordered some fresh rolls that came with fried tofu.  Our rolls were delivered within a minute of us ordering.  We didn't even have small plates or chop sticks yet.  I asked for some Thai chili paste which is a must to add spice to the rolls since they are almost always served with a sweet peanut sauce.   The rolls which came two to an order were decently priced but lacked a lot of distinctive flavor.  For the most part I tasted just rice noodles and lettuce of which neither has much flavor.  The sauce helped but they really needed something else.  More mint and basil, maybe some seasoning on the tofu.    For our main course I ordered the Pad Kee Mow which was already described as zesty, with shrimp.  The cost was $13.99 regardless of your protein choice.  When eating at foreign establishments I tend to not go over the top on spice levels for the fear that some of these places really make a level 10 a level 10+.  Well you need not to worry, if you like it spicy order a 10 and extra chili paste to adjust to your liking.  I went with a 9 to be conservative and I found the spice level to be more fitting to a 5 meaning very mild.  I ended up adding the rest of my chili paste and that did help pull the spice level closer to where I like it.  The noodles in my dish were OUTSTANDING!  This seems to always be a hit or miss when trying new places.  Are the noodles going to be overcooked, gummy, too thin or stuck together and chopped up.  I have had all of these issues at various places, but Silk Elephants noodles are just that incredibly silky.  They were in perfect form consistently cut broad.  No tears or clumpy stuck together noodles.  Just perfect.  The sauce as I alluded left me a little disappointed not only lacking the heat but also leaning toward the bland side.  Again with the help of the paste I was able to enhance the flavor, but it would have been nice to have the dish seasoned well in the kitchen.  My shrimp were on the smaller side and you get six per order.  Two or three more shrimps would have helped balanced the ratio of noodles and vegetables with protein but they were cooked very well.  The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was also very enjoyable.  With a few adjustments this would have easily been a 4 star dining experience, with a five star noodle, but the blandness brings it to a three.",

LUNCH DEAL: $8.50 (that goes until 3PM!) for a spring roll, small salad, soup and your choice of entree! Lots of choices for your entree. You choose a protein between chicken, beef, pork, tofu or can get 'vegetable'. Salad and spring roll were good. I was disappointed by the soup. I thought maybe we would be offered a sweet and sour soup (like Tom Yum?) but we got like a chicken noodle-like soup except with rice instead of noodles, not memorable.  RED CURRY: Pretty bland. Possibly there wasn't enough red curry paste? For a spice level of 7, I wasn't feeling the heat. After pad see ew, this is my Thai food go-to. GREEN CURRY: Actually had some more flavor compared to the red one. I really liked this but I didn't order it on first glance because I am not a fan of regular broccoli (wasn't specific if they used Chinese broccoli).  I would say the lunch portion size is standard and my boyfriend said he probably could've eaten two lunch meals and maybe would've been full.  Don't know if I'll be making a trip back, unless someone is craving Thai food and has a big group.",

The Thai food gets the job done at a good price; however I'd say it isn't the best I've had in Pittsburgh. They have a great lunch special and generous portion sizes. Wished they gave me more shrimp with my curry fried rice though. Only had 4 pieces on a mountain of rice. I normally never order fried rice dishes, but this one was pretty flavorful! I'd recommend that here.   My point of concern: I recently had dinner there. We ordered around 8 PM and the food didn't come out until after 9 PM. Frankly, I was disappointed & hungry. I was also surprised that they couldn't split the check 8 ways. I've definitely been there before with a large group, and they were able to do so...",

We were greeted and seated right then. We placed our orders and our appetizers arrived within 10 minutes. Our entrees, however, weren't ready for another 30 minutes. We spent approximately 45 minutes in the establishment and had to take our meals to go.  Also, while there, 2 other coworkers stopped in to pick up their orders (previously called in). They too waited for approximately 30 minutes for their order!  I would hope that this experience doesn't reflect attitudes towards minorities, as 3 of the 4 women I spoke of are AA.  Side note: the food was pretty good, but their first impression left a bad taste!",

Our service was a bit slow at first- I don't think they had someone to serve us so the bartender picked us up and did a great job.  My major complaint and reason I only gave 3 stars is for the prices.  The total for our meal was $65, which didn't seem bad at the time because I had a $60 gift certificate (from Groupon).  However if I were to go back without the gift certificate, I think I would be disappointed in the quality/amount to price ratio.",

A couple tapas:  crowned scallops and fresh rolls with tofu.  The scallops were fresh and excellently prepared, they were also nice and spicy.  I have definitely have had better fresh rolls (at the Green Mango)--and if I never had theirs, I guess these would have been fine.  I'm just used to the actual taste of mind and cilantro instead of cabbage--reminded me of an egg roll that wasn't fried.  Had the Wild Curry dish with shrimp, which was excellent--had it a spice level of 7 (wowzer!).  My husband had the tilapia with crispy basil, spice level 8--it was superb!  Presentation lovely, all very fresh ingredients--tasted divine!  They have a full bar, prices are pretty much in line with the rest of Pittsburgh.  I will definitely be back!",

The meat in both of them (chicken and beef, respectively) were a bit tough and chewy.  The curry noodles were too sauce-heavy.  The piquancy was a little higher than what I'm used to, for the level I gave them.  The pad thai was otherwise fine.  Pricing was ok.  The entrees are reasonably priced, maybe a little on the cheaper end for Thai food.  They make their money from the tapas though.",

You can imagine, then, that the very concept of tapas excites me.  I also love Thai food. So, a restaurant that has Thai tapas? I was in heaven.  SIlk Elephant is owned by the same people who own the Bangkok Balcony just around the corner. The Bangkok Balcony is much more of a straight-up fancy Thai Restaurant. Silk Elephant is a Tapas & Bar experience. Like the Bangkok Balcony the decor is beautiful and slightly on the upscale side.  Silk Elephant does offer many of the normal entrees that Bangkok Balcony offers. If you want a regular entree experience, go to Bangkok Balcony! You're at Silk Elephant to get the tapas!  Every single dish is delicious. I love ordering the tapas three at a time--and just as my table is finishing a round we'll work out the next three that we'll order. I love their Salmon Dumplings and the Corn Fritters and the Taro Crunch.  My only wish is that they had more tapas on the curry side of things. You can get a wide variety of curry entrees at the Bangkok Balcony, but you won't find very many curry-inspired tapas. The price is also not what I've come to love from dim sum--the $6 and $7 tapa dishes add up very quickly, so I usually reserved my visits to special occasions.",

Three Thai iced teas and six tapas dishes came to less than $40 before tip.  I fell in love with a pumpkin curry soup, one of the specials of the evening.  If they offer this, try it - it's just spicy enough, with pepitas to add a little crunch.  The fresh rolls were a little bland, as they tend to be, but the sauce improves them.  I wasn't crazy about the steamed veggie dumplings (too gummy) and the tofu crisp was just okay.  My boyfriend really liked the chicken curry puffs and said they reminded him of samosas.  The atmosphere is okay - it was a little quiet, the tables are a bit too close together in the part of the restaurant near Murray Avenue, and that part of the restaurant is also very drafty.  It was surprisingly casual - lots of baseball hats and jeans.  I would recommend Bangkok Balcony if you're starving, but Silk Elephant if you're just in the mood for a snack and a drink.",

    "text": "It was Friday night and Kay's turn to choose a restaurant. She spun the wheel, the pointer landed on Squirrel Hill's Silk Elephant, and Eastward we headed after work.   Never before have I been impressed with silverware. Silverware!  I suppose I take it for granted, but at Silk Elephant, I marveled at it.  Here our knives, forks, and spoons were seemingly forged by mythical blacksmiths, resembling swords, spades, and tridents. Their handles were thick, cylindrical and were looped at the end. It was as if combat was imminent.   We ordered two tapas; Salmon Rolls and the Seafood Steamed Dumplings. The Salmon Rolls came with what seemed to be a remoulade and therefore happily reminded me of my mothers salmon cakes. The Seafood Steamed Rolls are comprised of crab and shrimp and come with a ginger sesame soy sauce. Both were heavy, moist, meaty, each pleasurable parcel sticking to my insides like pierogi from a world away do. We could have easily eaten a devil's dozen of each. Our appetites had been sufficiently stoked.  I ordered the Duck Curry since duck is something I don't have often, and did the roasted, boneless, supple, fatty duck ever deliquesce delectably in my mouth along with chunks of tomato, grape, and pineapple. The broth of coconut milk and curry astonished my tongue with its delicate sweet/spicy highwire waltz. I poured it onto my white rice and relished its exotic flavors. When I ran out of rice, I asked for more and dumped it all into the bowl without regard for rules.   Kay ordered something really interesting that I had no idea existed that Silk Elephant calls Fruity Fried Rice. It the usual fried rice but with an obvious twist, the fruits added consisting of pineapple, apple, grapes, raisins, and oranges. Enormous twin cucumber discs acted as a garnish. Kay added shrimp to give it some more ooomph. Upon having a taste I couldn't get over how savory it was and how well the fruit went with the rice.   My few forays into the world of Thai cuisine have been interesting, Silk Elephant only adding more depth to that memoir. One thing I have taken away from my experiences with it so far is that Thai food is so remote yet close to home at the same time. Each time I've had Thai food, I've recalled something I've had before. As I mentioned earlier, the rolls reminded me of my  Irish/German/Hungarian mother's cooking and the dumplings of Poland, but in the case of the Duck Curry, I felt as if I had been whisked away to India and Thailand and back home again. In spite of the trendiness of the restaurant and the neighborhood it sits in, I felt comfort. I felt as if I had at least something in common with people I've never met and whose language I don't speak. It may sound shallow, and I'm clearly not alone in thinking this, but I've always been of the opinion that food can connect people to cultures, even if only by a thread. The Silk Elephant did so for me with an affectionate, ebullient, and mighty trumpet call. Praise be to the Taffeta Pachyderm.",

The restaurant was empty, it being a weeknight and all, but it still took us forever to get our food. We ordered soup and then several minutes later the waiter came back to take the rest of our order - the food we ordered later came before our soup. Not cool. We ordered a beef curry and I lost my appetite in response to the fact that the beef was not tender at all, in fact almost crunchy in a way. This was a very uncomfortable experience... the hostess even seated us at a small cramped table instead of a more spacious booth despite the fact that it was empty. We were one of out of three parties in the entire restaurant. I think I won't be going back here anytime soon.  Not to mention that the party next to us seemed like obnoxious working adults having a mid-life crisis in need of a trendy and exotic foray and proving their capacity to be interesting and exciting by eating thai food, trying to act like some sort of thai savant by ordering a 'thai beer' that was actually chinese. Yeah.  _________________________________________________________  Old Review:  The Thai food here is definitely Americanized and not as spicy as it should be, but I'm always more satisfied with a place that automatically brings out the spice dishes so that you can instantly add more spice to your plate - also helpful when sharing dishes / ordering for groups. The decor definitely looks nice, although sometimes I question whether certain aspects are actually 'thai'... nonetheless, friendly service, I've never had any bad experiences, and if you are a student in the Oakland area, this is probably the best choice for thai food...",

Second, the menu is impressive.  Lots of curries, brown sauce dishes, salads, and an interesting Thai tapas menu that I've never really encountered before.  And one of the best parts is that they are willing to make the dishes truly vegetarian, i.e. no hidden meat items like oyster sauce and shrimp paste.  Third, the service was great.  The waiter helped out with a very strong wine list.  And everyone had a smile.  Fourth, the prices are reasonable.  Dinner for two, including tip, could easily be under $40 without alcohol.  I didn't go for the full 5 stars because I thought that the food was a tad greasy.  Nothing too bad; but I make Thai at home and have been to plenty of Thai restaurants, so I know that restaurants can, if they want, reduce the amount of oil without sacrificing too much flavor.  That said, this place is great and in a cool location in the heart of Squirrel Hill N.",

My family can eat heck out of some Thai food, and this place was just the spot. They let you order how spicy/hot your food is from a scale of 1 through 10 (10 being the hottest.) This is perfect if you have a group with varied tastes for hotness. I got the roti and green curry special, level 1, some chicken satay and Mai Thai. YUM, YUM, YUM. My dad and brother got the traditional Thai soup (can't remember the name) level 7ish, and they loved it.   I like that they do tapas style, because Thai food is one of those cuisine where it's always more fun to try lots of things, and Silk Elephant let's you do that for a reasonable price, without needing to take three boxes of leftovers home.",

While it was tasty, I'm not a big fan of \"heavy cream\" to make food tasty...I mean isn't that the easy way out.  You can add butter or cream to anything and it will taste good - I want True pure flavors when I go out for Thai.  That's what I look forward to when I eat Thai and it just seemed to be lost on this dish.  I won't dismiss this place that easily, but I probably wouldn't order the red curry again.",

    "text": "Welcome to the Silk Elephant, Thai Tapas and Wine Bar.  Is it just me, or has the word \"Tapas\" become the most over-used word in the culinary world these days?  For those of you that aren't familiar with the word, let me explain.  \"Tapas\" is a small dish of something edible.  The word originated in Spain, but has found its way into almost every type of ethnic cuisine.  You can have Japanese Tapas, Moroccan Tapas, and even Italian Tapas.  But I'm getting off point again, back to The Silk Elephant. The Silk Elephant is a beautifully designed restaurant.  The walls have warm colored drapes, as well as Thai art.  There is a small wine bar; room enough for maybe 12 people.  There is an open kitchen, so you can see the cooks as they work.  The vibe in the kitchen is smooth and collected, even during busy hours (unlike and kitchens I've worked in).  The lighting is low, and the mood of the restaurant is quiet and soft; this is a good place to bring a date.  The service staff is attentive, but doesn't necessarily anticipate your needs.  I've never seen the same waiter/waitress there more than once; they must have a high turn-over rate.   We started with the Silk Elephant Rice Wrapper Rolls (2 pcs. $5.95) Cucumber carrot, lettuce, crab meat and rice paper served with a sweet chili sauce.  They were tasty, but when did cream cheese find its way into Thai cuisine? Fresh Rolls were also ordered (2 pcs. $5.50) Fried tofu, rice noodles, carrots, mint, basil leaves, served with a sweet brown sauce and ground peanuts.  The Fresh Rolls were good, but a little thick with one layer too many of the rice paper.  We really liked the sauce and the ground peanuts. There are many different Curry dishes to choose from at the Silk Elephant.  You can try Red, Green Panang, Duck or Wild Curry, to name a few.  Also available are Lamb dishes, Crab Cakes (Thai cuisine?), and Basil Duck.  Prices range from $8.95 to $20.00.  The Silk Elephant offers a wide variety of vegetarian dishes for those avoiding meat.   I would describe the cuisine at The Silk Elephant as \"close-to Thai-cuisine.\"  There are a few dishes on the menu that seem to be outside the realm of True Thai food.  I'm not sure if the owners/Chefs are trying to appease their conflicted clientele, but it sure confused me.  The ambiance is nice, but if you're searching for True Thai gastronomy, you may be disappointed.",

Great decor, silverware, chairs and tables...  Food comes in tapas style (small plate), which is great when you want to try multiple dishes and see which one you like (cons-you may not get very full).  Price is reasonable for small plate tapas style.  My fav here are the following: -Thai Iced Tea (Tea w/ Milk) -Curry Puffs -Satay Beef -Phuket Pork -Crispy Calamari -Siam Paragon  Not so great: - Crispy Rice with Dipping Sauce  Parking maybe a little difficult on the busy Murray Street, we got lucky that night, ad parked right across the street.

You see, I'm a die-hard SBL fan, and when my favorite Thai curries prepared to my spice specifications are available for such a low price, why would I ever go to a pricy imitator?  I came in quite reluctantly while trying (and failing) to avoid a lovely Pittsburgh downpour, but I was quite surprised at what I found. Silk Elephant carves out some new territory, blending the array of Thai curries offered by SBL and others with pan-Asian small plates.  I opted for the grilled lamb and some dumplings, and the lamb was AMAZING.  Best lamb I've ever eaten.  I wish there had been more...but I guess small plates are small!  Service was also quite nice, with a passing busboy taking pity on our drowned-rat-selves and sending a flurry of cloth napkins our way. Waters were refilled promptly and the lamb was actually a recommendation from the server. Cheapskate that I tend to be, I probably will continue to frequent SBL for my simple Thai cravings, but I'll be back for that lamb.",

When you see that they have a tapas menu, among other unique items on the menu, it should be evident that the concept of Thai is only a starting point here.   My husband and I went on a Saturday night for dinner. We had a reservation for 6:30 but it seems the restaurant doesn't get busy until around 7:30. Even though they have an extensive wine list, we brought our own bottle (corkage fee is $15). We had six different small plates - each one of them fresh, hot, and served with a delicious sauce.  Our waitress, Ilene, was fantastic. She was very attentive and had great timing for the pace of our meal. It turns out that she is the owner! We also complimented the managed, who was very friendly as well.   Overall, we got exactly what we came for: a relaxing, slow, savory, tapas meal in a casual, intimate restaurant.",

The waitress spoke such poor English that we couldn't  communicate to ask about how dishes were prepared. There was an unfamiliar fish on the special menu she was unable to describe at all, so I didn't get it. The lamb tapas I had loved on a previous visit was cut way too thin, was well done and very spicy sauce, like an 8, when I had ordered medium and 0 spicy. Sent it back. She brought it back less spicy but didn't get the part about the doneness and the same well done meat was still on the plate.   Crab cakes were very good. Seafood salad was undressed, totally bland seafood on iceberg lettuce. Pork chops were overlooked. It took forever to get the check. We saw our waitress way on the other side of the restaurant and had to ask another waitress for the check. She said manager was not in, was at the sister restaurant.",

    "text": "Up in Squirrel Hill, there are two Thai restaurants: Bangkok Balcony and its younger more 'hip' sister restaurant, Silk Elephant. Thai places aren't usually on my restaurant rotation so usually I end only end up visiting them for special occasions (birthdays, etc.). But one fateful day, the Groupon of the day was 30 bucks for $60 at Silk Elephant. I realized it's been a while since I've returned, so I decided to make a return trip.  In case you're not familiar with how Groupon works, you basically get to buy a gift certificate to a restaurant or service for half the face value (sometimes less!). My friend and I underestimated the cost of dishes at Silk Elephant (too many visits to Tamari makes you forget not every tapas place in the world costs an arm and leg) and ended up proceeding to order 4 tapas in addition to main entrees and drinks to get to the $60 mark (I'm missing some pics b/c we were too busy nom-ing on food and getting tipsy; our drinks ended up bringing us well over $60, oops haha). No, we didn't finish everything, and during the entire meal various other tables kept looking over at the masses of food that appeared on our table.  Anyways, overall the food is generally good; I want to say their curries and noodle dishes are almost identical to Bangkok Balcony (which would make sense being sister restaurants). If you choose to go the tapas route (which I personally wouldn't recommend unless you're sharing with a companion so you can also get or split an entree), I'd have to say their lamb rack is my favorite altogether: cooked well (happens rarely, but sometimes a little bit overcooked, but I'm extremely picky), nice sauce pairing and just a large enough portion for you to savor it without it being overwhelming or filling you up. I'm not too fond of the rolls, but everyone else I know seems to like them.  With main entrees, the curries and noodle dishes are what you would expect; I like my curries to have a bit more spice and dimension to them, but my palate is probably different from your average diner. If you're a spicehead, you probably know what I mean when I say it's difficult to get dishes as hot as you want... =/  Overall I'd say 3.5 stars for the food, but I'll round up because the ambiance is nice, service is always excellent, and they have a decent bar.",

They were both crunchy, cooked to perfection, and piping hot. I loved every bit of what I ate. I also tried some of the Silk Elephant rolls my friend ordered and was a little jealous that I didn't order them for myself.  They also have a pretty decently sized wine menu, though I ended up getting the Widow's Bite to drink. It was pure alcohol.  The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Our waitress didn't speak English very well, but she was still very attentive and did her best to help us pick things out on the menu. Our plates were cleared away pretty much the minute we were finished with them, and the prices were beyond reasonable.  I would definitely come back!",

All of the tapas were good and the dipping sauces were all very tasty.  What really urked me about the place was the atmosphere. I didn't like the seating arrangement. I made a reservation for a romantic dinner with my girlfriend. When we first walked in I was certain that this was a good choice... but after being seated for about a minute I changed my mind. We were sandwiched between two other couples who were also attempting to have a romantic evening. This would have been fine if there were more than a foot between tables. The last thing I want to hear about while wining and dining my girlfriend are a middle-aged couples marital problems.  Given that this is one of the pricier restaurants in squirrel hill, I will not likely return. i think other similar restaurants (Sun Penang, Bangkok Balcony, etc) provide food that is just as good at a better price and with a better atmosphere.",

I knew it was dangerous to try Thai in Pittsburgh given that my regular Thai place is the amazing Sripraphai in NY.  I think the quality of the food and preparation is extremely poor, as if whoever is preparing the food is still learning how to cook.  We had the morning glory watercress salad, which is a C compared to the A+ fried watercress at Sripraphai. But if I wasn't comparing, this dish would actually be my favorite. The fried watercress came out in globs, but the star of the plate was the chicken in lemongrass and lime juice. There was a slight hint of tamarind and belachan. You could actually order rice and eat this as a meal instead of a starter. Also, a level 7 spicy turned out to be more like 4. Next time I'm ordering a level 10.  The rack of lamb was terrible. The gravy tasted like a bad experiment and didn't remotely taste Thai. The lamb was so small and thin. I would not recommend ordering this.  The Siam Paragon was tasty and had the flavors there, but the execution was poor. The fried egg noodle wasn't crispy, and the sticky rice was very, very, very HARD and difficult to even chew! I've never been to a Thai place who screwed up sticky rice. I was really disappointed because I was looking forward to a mango and sticky rice dessert.  I ordered mango juice which tasted old and WARM, so I gave it to my bf who gave me his Thai ice tea, which was good.  I would be back to try other things because the price is so reasonable, and I do really like the fried watercress salad. I'll keep my expectations low next time.",

Nice environment pretty Decor and spacious room for my elbows :) A girlfriend and I went early on a saturday afternoon so we were seated right away there is also a bar you can sit at.   We chose to share 3 tapas dishes and split a fried rice  Salmon rolls perfect texture with the crispy outside fried and salmon puree inside also very complimentary spicey sauce with a nice tanginess to it.   Crab fried wonton with cream cheese also melt in your mouth good but very tiny you get 4 for 4.50 they are a little larger than a large gumball you probably should get at least 5 or 6 for the price but oh well.   Corn Cakes were just ok they are a little over sweet with the sauce served peanuts added are yummy though. I would try something else.   Curry fried rice I thought it was supposed to be yellow curry but it wasnt really you can taste some tumeric but it was a little dry other than that. It was full of  yummy veggies and spicy as we had asked for though they use red pepper flakes not fresh peppers in it. Overall it was flavorful a little on the sweet side.  Bill was $32 for one thai iced tea one plate of fried rice and three tapas all in all a decent price for a lunch date. I'll be back to try more tapas!",

For our main courses, Rick tried the tapas menu, sampling just about everything, or so it seemed.  Me, I went for the basil duck topped with snow peas, carrots, and mushrooms.  I haven't had much duck in my life.  Duck is very sweet and if not done properly, it can be very greasy.  Mine was just perfect, however.    Silk Elephant also appears to have an extensive bar.  I'm a nondrinker, but Rick availed himself of an Asian pear martini.  Service is great here too and the atmosphere is quite relaxed.

I'd suggest going for lunch if you want a standard like rice noodles or curry, but if you're feeling adventurous, try some of the smaller sized options on the dinner menu that you won't find in your average American Thai place.",

    "text": "4.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous so I'll round up.  Silk Elephant is quite possibly Squirrel Hill's busiest restaurant, and for good reason. In the rather crowded market for Thai food in Pittsburgh, Silk Elephant delivers on both ambiance and food. The space exhibits beautiful yet subtle decorative touches, and while you may find seating and table space a little cramped this doesn't hinder the dining experience too much. Although some of the servers lack fluency in English the service is attentive, and my picky dining companions' multiple, borderline irrational requests have all been met with skill.  I enjoy Silk Elephant's extensive menu of Thai tapas, as everything manages to taste different even though not all of the small plates hit the mark. The Salmon Rolls are fried properly and packed with salmony flavor, and similarly the Curry Puffs offer a perfectly flaky crust and a delicately flavored, meaty filling. Haw Mork Fish is an incredibly light, deeply flavorful steamed mix of red curry and fresh tilapia, and the Fish Cakes although apathetically named offer a superbly seared outside with a soft, creamy, subtly sweet fishy center. Corn Fritters are wonderfully crispy but cloyingly sweet. Tofu Crisp lacks flavor even when doused in sweet chili sauce. The main entrees are unfortunately not as adventurous as the tapas menu, but the Thai staples are all solid. Curries carry robust flavors though err on the rich, sweet side. Noodles and fried rices exhibit proper cooking and are complexly flavored. Proteins are of high quality and amply portioned. Everything is reasonably priced to boot.  In short, Silk Elephant does quite well for a special occasion or for the semi-adventurous eater who wants to sample a wide range of flavors.",

Good spring rolls though.",

    "text": "I split four orders of tapas with a friend. The first dish I tried was fish cakes. The cakes were a bit bland with the scallions in the cakes being the most prominent flavor; I couldn't discern the type of fish from the taste of the cake, but the fish cakes came with a tasty ginger sauce (which was called a cucumber sauce).   Next, I tried chicken wrapped in a panandus leaves. It was a hassle to uncover the chicken because you are not supposed to eat the leaves, but it ended up being my favorite tapa. The chicken had an unique spice to it but was also a little dry; the dish did come with a sesame sauce which made the dish less dry (but was likely some soy and corn syrup based sauce).  The third dish I tried was Thai shrimp and pork toast with a layer of sesame seeds on top. I thought this was the most interesting tapa; however, my palate must not be sensitive enough to discern the subtle flavors because I did not taste any shrimp or pork with the breading and the sesame seeds contributing all of the flavor.  Last, I tried a mixed seafood dumpling. It was probably my second favorite tapa, but the serving was quite tiny and the dough was too thick for such a small dumpling. If the dumpling had more filling then this could have been a very good dish.  The service was fine. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the specials and was quite nice. The entire staff was also friendly.",

It is the perfect place to have a cocktail and Sean, the best bartender I know, really knows his stuff.  He can make any and everything!  My personal favorite is his Lemon Drop Martini...it's to die for (check out the picture).  They have an excellent wine selection too.

    "text": "I have a confession to make: I'm absolutely in love with the Silk Elephant.  The only problem with this, of course, is that it's walking distance from my house, and I worry that someday, I'll end up eating here every day and go absolutely broke trying to sample everything on the menu.  My husband and I have now been here twice, once by ourselves, and once with our favorite other couple.  Both times, we have had a totally pleasant experience, and I can't think of a single thing on the menu we haven't loved.  On our most recent visit, we sampled the mushroom soup.  Although I'm a big mushroom person, I wasn't sure if I would like this soup, or if it would end up being like the cream of mushroom stuff that comes out of a can.  It certainly was not: the texture was like a light bisque, creamy but not overpowering.  It was definitely a good start to the dinner!  Although they do have a full menu of entrees at Silk Elephant, on both visits, we have stuck to the tapas menu, so we can sample a bunch of different things all at once.  We've tried both the seafood and the moo & goong (pork and shrimp) steamed dumplings, and loved both.  They are not your standard Chinese restaurant dumplings: the shape is more like little sacks of coins than like pierogies.  Also, I have to comment on the Thai toast, which is EXCELLENT.  Thai toast is one of those things I love to try each time we visit a new Thai place, and I think Silk Elephant has the best.  Each of the tapas plates comes with its own dippy sauce, paired to complement the flavor of the dish.  The Thai toast (theirs is made with shrimp and pork) comes with a sticky sweet cucumber sauce.  I am craving it, just thinking about it now!  We also tried the Phuket beef, which had the taste and texture of Mongolian beef.  Loved it!  Even the crispy rice was yummy, although it's just an extra-crispy version of a rice cake.  I also love how every dish you get just *looks* perfect, like it's going to appear on a cooking show or something.  Presentation is always appreciated!  Silk Elephant also maintains a decent wine list, and while it can be hard to pick something that goes with every bit of tapas that you try, they have enough variety that you can find something that works.  The servers will refill your wine glass as they are passing by, if it's low, and they also refill water with speed.  I thought that was especially important, since a lot of the food was quite salty.  If you're not in the mood for wine, order a big (and I do mean BIG) pot of green tea to go with your meal.  This is a great place for a nice, low-key but classy dinner out with your significant other, or a great spot to double date.  The atmosphere is relaxing and peaceful, although they do have the oddest silverware.  It's super heavy and huge, but very unique.  If you're making a date night out of your trip here, I highly suggest springing for the chocolate lava cake.  It's heavenly!!  (But split it - it's also huge!)  Another quick tip: Silk Elephant frequently has coupons floating around.  They've done a Groupon deal at least once, and there are sometimes coupons in Clipper Magazine or other mail flyers if you live in the area.  The prices are great for a tapas place, but the coupons help even more.",
