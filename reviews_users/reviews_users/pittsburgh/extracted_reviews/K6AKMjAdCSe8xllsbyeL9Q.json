I've been eating here for years, and though the chicken quality varies and bold flavor is lacking, you can't go wrong with the combination platter of bourbon chicken, mixed vegetables, and lo mein. You can always count on this place to provide lots of food for some of the lowest prices in oakland.   There's plenty of outdoor seating and often musical entertainment in the summer. The bubble tea is a refresher during the hottest days, and they also provide fountain drink refills for a quarter.   Convenient, good value, and pleasant staff.",

Food: this is only reviews off the bubble tea because of previous reviews claiming it was great. Far from great it was! This watered down, tasteless, and sorry excuse for bubble tea puts all other bubble teas on top. Worst of all the bubbles tasted old and as if they were stored away all winter. Not fresh! In fact, our bubbles were more like giant balls stuck together. The tea was watery and lacked True flavor of mango or macha. What a dissappointment, however the people of the burgh wouldn't notice the difference. So fortunately for you, this is a good thing.   Service: meh, slow and it seemed that they had no order in serving people.  Interior: it's outside, which was nice. 1 star given.   Disclaimer: I drink lots of bubble tea, if you want a True experience go to Philly or Miami. They make a thicker juice with fresher bubbles.",

Fifteen minutes later the guy hands me my smoothie. I took a sip. This was followed by a frown. Another sip was necessary to make sure I was not just imagining things. Yep. This was the worst smoothie I had ever tasted. And I have had a lot of bubble teas in my day. Forget the fresh fruit. It was too watered down to be identified as a mango smoothie. And the tapioca balls were tough and bland. I had just paid $4 for water and crappy tapioca balls.  The search for good boba tea in Pittsburgh continues.",

My friend ordered a strawberry smoothie and I ordered a matcha (green tea) bubble tea. Both were pretty bland, the strawberry one was probably worse. The matcha bubble tea did have the flavor of green tea, but was still quite watered down. Nothing like the bubble tea I've had in Philadelphia. Huge disappointment.

I'm not a bubble tea connoisseur so I can't judge how it stacks up to others, but I enjoyed mine (as did the two others who we're with me).  It had a nice flavor that wasn't weak and it had a nice thickness.    The dumplings were a nice size and cooked well.

The chicken teriyaki was good in that the portions were huge (more than a chipotle bowl if you're looking for a comparison), especially the fried rice. And the chicken was nice and mostly soft. However, the vegetables and egg in the fried rice were a bit lacking in that there were only a few pieces of chopped carrots, egg, peas, and even less egg. Also, unless you're seriously hungry, you'll definitely have some to save for leftovers.  Their bubble tea, compared to Fuku, had tapioca bobas (also called pearls) that were smaller and harder to chew with a lack of flavor to them. The liquid was sliiiiightly more thicker. What was odd to me was the 1/2 inch of froth on top of it but that was probably from them shaking/stirring (James Bond pls tell me the difference if there is one) the liquid to make it thicker, but the drink quickly lost its texture so I don't think it was worth the froth in my opinion. So next time, I'll be avoiding their bubble tea because of its lack of quality.  Tl;dr: go for the food (b/c of their portions in regards to meat & rice, a 4 star) but not their bubble tea (a 1 star).",

The cashier was very knowledgeable on the bubble tea menu - I asked which ones didn't have dairy because I'm vegan. He went through the whole menu, pointing out which ones did and which ones didn't! I appreciated it a lot. In the end, I bought honeydew with bubbles. The drink itself was delicious, but the bubbles were kind of hard, not chewy and warm like what I was expecting. Would possibly come back for their food, but definitely for the drink!",

It's good for when you're really hungry and meeting a friend on a nice day, but I wouldn't go there for any real occasion. Mostly this place is great for the location on schenley plaza. I don't think it would do as well if it was just a regular restaurant.   Bubble tea: NO. As a certified bubble tea lover I cringe when I see people holding cups from ATH. This is not bubble tea, people. The bubbles are chewy and overcooked with no flavor, and few and very far between. A weird froth tends to develop as you near the bottom of the cup, which is disconcerting to say the least. Please please please do not even call what you are drinking bubble tea.

My veggies were too greasy to eat, the rice was flavorless, and my sesame chicken had so much fat and gristle, I threw most of it away. I tried my friends' dishes, which were all similarly bad. If you're just hanging in Schenley, and hungry, go next door to the awesome Conflict Kitchen, or down the street to the surprisingly good cafeteria at Phipp's (you don't have to pay for admission to eat there). If you want quick, cheap Chinese food, this is not the place to get it, y'all. But get a bubble tea. Those are delightful.",

Not wanting a huge portion of food and trying to eat healthy, I took a change on a roll of sushi and a seaweed salad. I thought that since I didn't order anything that needed to be cooked, it wouldn't take too long. After waiting for way longer than is necessary to make sushi, they told me they were out of seaweed salad and offered me a replacement or a refund (of which I took the latter). Again, I waited a pretty ridiculous amount of time and eventually got my roll. It was tiny, but it tasted alright. Employees were nice. All in all, about what you might expect from a tiny Asian food stand next to the plaza. Probably wouldn't go back.",

We ordered pork dumplings as a shared appetizer and an entree for each of ourselves. The food is what you would expect from a Panda Express or any random non-authentic Chinese place in the US. But it's convenient, and the view is hard to beat. After chowing down Chinese food you can walk around the area, and maybe get some dessert from the nearby waffle place.

A friendly girl opened the sliding door for me to order. They had a decent selection of dishes. I ended up opting for a tea drink which they had about six or seven options. I chose their strawberry bubble drink.  Within a few minutes it was ready and I pretty much devoured it. Tons of bubbles inside to chew on and the strawberry drink was not really what I was expecting but I ended up really liking it. It wasn't tea and milky and it wasn't necessary a smoothie it was some sort of hybrid which I really liked overall. And it was only $4 or so for a large which I enjoyed even more.   It's a good place for a quick bite or drink in the middle of the college town.",

The day was chilly but the sun was out, and as we strolled through Schenley Plaza, I noticed \"bubble tea\" on the sign, so I figured I'd get one.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a mango-green bubble tea, and so I settled on the mango bubble drink.  It was basically a mango smoothie/puree with tapioca pears thrown in for good measure.  It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.    Asia Tea House offers a variety of other options, and they were open when few of the other vendors in the plaza were open.  The girl at the counter was very friendly.  I would probably not make this my top destination, but it was an Ok stop for my in-the-moment-passing-by-a-bubble-tea-sign craving.",

It had a nice honey dew flavor (which is my go to flavor for boba teas), the perfect amount of coldness to make it extra refreshing on a hot summers day and a good amount of chewy boba pearls. It seemed a tad bit sweet but I felt that was more of a reflection of the fact that the flavor itself was more concentrated than other bubble teas which for all intensive purposes attested to the fact that it was good quality. The slushy/foamy texture at the end made it a bit hard to drink the remainder of the boba so I would suggest adding a little milk at the end to savor the rest of the flavor.",

(Other friends recommend the orange chicken). Lo mein doesn't have any veggies or anything in it, it's just noodles. But the green beans are freaking delicious and fresh every single time, so I recommend getting that as a side. (They're also pretty veggie friendly - my friend asked them if they could do a general tso's tofu and they happily obliged).   I've had their bubble tea before and I'm not really a fan. I have friends who really enjoy their taro and matcha bubble tea, but I've never enjoyed any of the ones I've gotten from here.  It's cheap and in a convenient location.

Me and a friend walk past it several times a week, and this time, their daily special caught our eyes. 1 entree 2 sides for $7? Or 2 entrees 1 side for $8? If you're craving some American-Chinese food that's: fast, under $10, and weather's nice, I won't judge.   VEGGIE TOFU + ORANGE CHICKEN + LO MEIN ($8): Lowkey good and they give a lot. You can say it's not real Chinese food and I'll agree with you on that. But you can't say that it's still not tasty. I do have to say that I wished the lo mein had more vegetables, as it was literally all noodles and was actually quite bland. Veggie tofu I thought lacked flavor too, but the zucchini and carrots were yummy and nicely cooked. Orange chicken is my guilty pleasure and in my meal I actually saw a cooked orange peel that I thought was funny. Well I know that they use actually oranges now..  SERVICE: Quite fast! Well. Me and the friend came here around 11 after class when they literally just opened for the day so I'd hope that they wouldn't be slow LOL. They also offer condiments like soy sauce and duck sauce. It's not laying out but I specifically asked for hot oil and they gave it to me. Yum yum yummmmm.   Asia Tea House, cheap, very 'American-Chinese', just \"meh\" for me. If you're looking for authentic and not as cheap, try Hunan Bar or Sichuan Gourmet.",

The fried rice was nice, nothing extraordinary, but the vegetable spring rolls are delicious. You get a large amount of food for an amazing price, excellent for college students. The food itself is average nothing special, but a great value for the price. In terms of spice I had to add Sriracha to everything to add some spicy flavor to the food.   Overall great place and you definitely get your money's worth.",

The food is just okay- it won't blow you away and everything I've ever tried here and is just missing something. Their chicken lo mein is meh- even with taking it home to doctor it up, it still just didn't impress me. Their sweet potato tempura sushi is ok, but it sure isn't memorable. There are a few things to like about this place: 1) it's affordable, 2) it's convenient for college students to get to, 3) there's always outside seating available. Overall though, if you are looking for delicious Sushi or Chinese, I would recommend not coming here.",

The food is definitely not very authentic, but in my opinion it's pretty good Americanized Chinese food. The fried rice was nicely flavored, the steamed vegetables were not too raw or overcooked, and the garlic sauce chicken was tender. The size of the meal was a good deal for the price you pay. There's no indoor seating, but there's plenty of outdoor seats. Also, on the warmer days it's very nice to bring a blanket and eat on the lawn.",

I usually get the chicken and broccoli and the fried rice. My friends enjoy the general tso chicken and the sushi also is not half bad. Wanted to go there for dinner tonight but my girlfriend said no. I could eat there everyday if I wouldn't get fat. Just watch your stomach folks definitely not a stomach pleaser.",
