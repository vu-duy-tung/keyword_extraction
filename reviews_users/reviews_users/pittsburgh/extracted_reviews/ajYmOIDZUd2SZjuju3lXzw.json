I would compare it positively to any other Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is very casual, nothing fancy. But staff are super nice and the food comes out very quickly. The 1 to 10 rating scale means something here. I get an eight, and it's always quite spicy. Great red curry, pad prik khing, and garlic pepper. You won't go wrong eating here.",

Ordered Thai spring rolls and vegetable pad thai.  Waited about 20 minutes for my order. Everything was steaming hot, which was great. However: Though the spring rolls were nicely hot and crunchy, they had no flavor/seasoning other then a black pepper taste. They seemed to be primarily cabbage - I didn't see any other vegetables in them.    The pad thai was not good. The noodles were overcooked, rubbery and dark - not fresh.  I have come across this issue with take-out from other thai restaurants. I wonder if, for take-out, some places have a bunch of pre-made items that they just reheat in the microwave? I don't know how else to explain these rubbery, shriveled noodles. Plus, the sauce had a strange taste - maybe like it was a beef-base? Very odd. And disappointing, especially considering the pretty positive \"Munch\" article they had framed on their wall that featured both items I had ordered.  Since I'm pregnant, I didn't eat more than a few bites of the pad thai because it just didn't taste right to me.  Not planning to go out of my way to go back there.",

    "text": "While in the mood for something other than an elephant scab on a bun for lunch today, I walked into Siam Thai to see what they were like. The place was nearly empty when I walked in with the exception of one couple already seated. Granted, we had a ton of snow dumped on us this morning so I didn't take the lack of business as a sign that there was anything wrong with the place. I was greeted cheerfully when I walked in and was seated immediately. Within a minute I had a menu, a glass of water and a single ragoon on a plate with sauce.  Looking over the menu I decided on the Stir Fried Broccoli.  With each meal you get your choice of chicken, pork, tofu, beef, duck or shrimp. I originally was going to go with the duck but since they were out of that on this particular day I went with the beef.  I was also asked to what degree of spiciness I would like and I went with an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale.   The meal was in front of me within five minutes. The rice came molded into a heart-shape which I thought was a nice touch. The broccoli and carrots were good and crunchy (not soft and overcooked), the brown sauce had a very good kick to it but sadly the meat was awful! It was all tough and gristly making me wish that they had the duck available or that I would have chosen chicken instead.     My bill came to a little over $10. The service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and this place has a lot going for it... but it's not even close to being the quality of Nicky's Thai Kitchen on Penn. I give it a 3 star mainly due to the meat.",

It was uncomfortably chilly and the two space heaters that were running did nothing to heat the space up.  I ate my meal with my scarf on and would have worn my hat too but I thought it might look a little low brow. The service was friendly but a little too quick when it came to placing my order. I was given almost no time to review the menu. I had hardly had my coat off before the waitress was back asking me if I already knew what I wanted to eat.  This being my first visit and all I did not appreciate that much, but I am sure in future visits it would be a nice touch once I familiarize myself with the menu.   I had the steamed pork dumplings and the Garlic pepper with mixed seafood. The dumplings were rubbery and under seasoned and  after eating them I wished I had never ordered them.  The garlic pepper sauce on my entree is what has me awarding 3 stars to Siam it was very flavorful.  But the mixed seafood looked like a horror show with three tiny sad looking shrimp and a cold scallop. For $10.50 I was fed a quarter cup of food and had to eat all of my rice to fill me up.  I am in no rush to get back Siam. And the server kept trying to hand my dishes to the man setting next to me.  The dining room was not busy at all for them to have gotten my order mixed up. It's cold and flu season I really don't want some stranger pawing my food unnecessarily.",

I ate lunch in a couple times but many years ago and always had good service (I ordered pineapple fried rice back then, delish) I know they closed and reopened so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I ordered pineapple curry with chicken, level 6. It was waiting for me after 20 minutes. I will say, the dining room was packed and very loud, I could barely hear the cashier tell me my total. My lunch was $9.10 plus tip and it is amazing! The crab Rangoon was a nice surprise and totally delicious, the curry is even better! I will definitely be back to try the fried rice again!",

    "text": "Man, this place defines what I think of when I talk about Mom and Pop establishments.  These places don't have large dining rooms or fancy decor but their food is as good as, if not better, than the big name places.  My lunch crew frequents another Thai place that will not be named here, because that isn't fair.  A few days ago one of the guys, who loves spice, was going on about a little place that was more affordable but just as good.  Yesterday I decided to give that place a shot, and I was not disappointed.  From the moment that I walked in the door I felt as though Siam had the potential to be the type of small business that I love.  It is the kind of place that you'd completely miss unless, and potentially pass by, unless someone points it out.  When I walk into one of these smaller establishments I pay attention to three things.  1. How does it smell?  If it smells weird, I'm out.  I made the mistake of ignoring this rule once and regretted it.  Siam smelled like yummy food, as it should.  2. Are there plenty of customers?  We were early for lunch,but the place was already half filled.  That is a good sign.  3. Was there a friendly greeter.  There was!  Boom!  Magic was about to happen, I could feel it.  Once we were seated I took a quick look at the menu to see if there was anything interesting other than my default choice.  I didn't see anything out of the ordinary.  Being that this was my first visit we decided to get some appetizers.  We ordered Thai Spring Rolls and Samosas.    The spring rolls were fried to perfection.  Not too oily, and filled with flavor.  The home-made sweet and sour sauce that came with them was an excellent addition.  It was a light color like butter... sooo good.  There were too many people around for me to lick the bowl... plus we were sharing and licking the bowl is against bro code when sharing.  I personally love Samosas.  They are missing from the menu at other place that we frequent.  Siam's Samosas were so good that they may cause me to make Siam a regular spot over the other place.  Like the spring rolls they were fried to perfection.  The filling was perfect.  The texture was soft and they were seasoned just right.  Not too much, or too little.  They were served with a cucumber sauce, according to the menu.  It looked a lot like the sweet and sour sauce with peanuts on it.  Either way, it was delicious.  I may need a to-go order over the weekend.  I forgot to mention, we were also given a free Crab Rangoon, bonus!  The big thing with Thai places is the ability to pick your spice level.  Siam has a range of 1 to 10, which is double the range that some other local places have.  For some reason, I like the larger range... but this could be purely psychological.    When going to a new place for the first time I tend to stick with a dish that I know I like.  If they do well with that then I'll come back and branch out.  When it comes to Thai, I love Pad Thai.  So I ordered it at a spice level 6.  My friend ordered the same dish at a level 10!  Level 6 had plenty of spice, in fact I'd consider going back to a 5 next time.  I'm not sure how my buddy was able to handle a 10.  Thankfully they kept the water flowing.  In spite of the spice, it was darn good.  I couldn't stop eating.  The noodles were perfectly cooked, the sauce tasted great, the portion of peanuts was perfect, and the chicken was good too!  My only regret was not trying the Thai Iced Tea... Next time Siam.... Next time... and believe me.  There WILL be a next time.",

Their Thai tea was absolutely delicious!   I really loved that they give you a complimentary crab Rangoon for appetizers. It came with a oil based sauce which was super delicious.   Great place for Thai food, good service, and great Thai tea!",

Small, cosy eatery that's tucked away in one of downtown Pitt's side streets so it's easy to miss if you don't know where you're going.   Not as busy as you'd expect during the lunch hour and we were seated immediately. I ordered the spicy fried rice with beef. I'm a spicy eater so ordered it level 10. I've noticed a lot of Thai restaurants don't deliver on the spice level but not this spot! I was definitely glowing by the end of lunch!   The combination of spices was excellent & the meat was fresh & tender. The rice also, was well made & not clumpy. All important factors for me that show that each element of the dish is freshly prepared. They also served a crab Rangoon as a complimentary appetizer; a nice touch & delicious to boot.   All in all, if you're in downtown Pitt & have a hankering for Thai...you could do a lot worse!",

I have had some really good ones in the past but nothing beats the ones you can get here. The Thai Spicy Fried Rice and Green Curry are to die for I tell you. Wow! Talk about dishes that pack a punch. These for sure hit the spot! I like my Thai spicy and this is how it should be done. They know what they're doing. The restaurant is kind of small and during lunch hour it is always busy and packed. I call ahead and my order is always ready, waiting and warm when I arrive.

The crab rangoon actually had a light fishy flavor, ODD.  The pad thai was reddish in color, also ODD, dry, and pretty bland.  Portion/Bang for your Buck=POOR.  Huge bowl of dry noodles with 4 shrimp for $13.  4 tiny spring rolls for $6, 4 crab rangoon for $6.  Delivery fee of $3 to wait 2 hours, PLUS A TIP, before you find out it will take 2 hours.

Recently, working in this part of downtown on Blvd of Allies, there a ton of lunch spots to choose from. It's my goal to get more familiar with this side of town and find all the hidden gems that there may be. I can largely thank my coworkers for that because no one ever packs lunches any more. Besides me of course.   First time walking in and it's a small place. The dining room is tiny and the tables are pretty close to one another. Being that it was 12pm noon and lunch time, there wasn't an empty seat in the place. But that is when the quick service takes over. I went with a party of 8 including myself and are orders were placed and food was brought out to us in about 20 minutes.   Besides the quick service, the food was delicious! I got the Cashew Nut chicken with white rice. I'm a baby when it comes to spicy, so I got a 0. I know, no need to rub it in. But my dish was perfect and I really enjoyed the crunch of the cashews. All for $9 and you can't beat that for lunch! A cute little touch was my rice being shaped into a heart! I feel the love Siam Thai, I feel the love!",

    "text": "The food is great, but getting here can be a challenge.  In my case, I was driving from the Uniontown area, and following GPS directions. If you are not from this region, attend to which lane you are told to be in, especially on bridges! Even then, be careful; I was directed to make a left turn at an intersection which had NO TURNS signs posted, and had to loop around in order to get to a nearby parking ramp.  This is a small place, and might be easy to overlook, but it was busy when we were there, late in the lunch hour, with more people coming in after us. The decoration may not be attractive, and the plates and glasses might look like they were acquired at a thrift store, but they are all clean...and you are going to get wonderful food.  We ordered Thai iced tea, which was just the right flavor; I've been to a number of Thai restaurants across the USA, and the drink (and food!) were consistent with the best of them. We also got a complimentary cream-cheese wonton, with a little dipping sauce.  We had ordered a samosa appetizer, which was crispy outside and steamy inside. This was a great way to start the meal: Something tasty, but it didn't fill you up.  I ordered the Siam Tofu, steamed vegetables and crispy tofu with a Thai peanut sauce. There was a small amount of pooled water on the plate from the vegetables, which thinned the sauce a bit, but it was still flavorful. The tofu was served in long-but-wide planks, so I found a bite-size was achieved by cutting those in two. The side of rice came molded into a heart shape, which was very appealing, visually.  My companion ordered the Pad Kee Mao, drunken noodles with tofu, and enjoyed it very much. It is one of her favorite dishes at Thai places, and she kept the leftovers from hers to eat later.  One point on ordering: Spiciness. They have a ten-point scale, from 1 being no spice, to 10 being very spicy. The waiter told us that 3 is a good medium spice point to start with, and I agree. There was enough to notice and feel it, but it wasn't overwhelming.  We had leftovers which we took with, and enjoyed later on our trip. The menu made me wish it was close enough for us to visit again!",

All the dishes came out quickly and were amazing.  One thing I will say is that I like the way they spice the dishes here.  I usually get a 10 at other places but a 7 was good enough for me here.

They are stone cold serious about spice, and I absolutely love it.  Their pad thai is delicous, the spring rolls are awesome and plentiful, and the crab angels are divine.  I feel like before I knew this place existed I settled for sub par Thai Food with lack luster seasoning and spice levels.   I am forever changed. My mind has been made up. My heart has been filled.

Their price points are reasonable and their portion sizes are filling and pleasing. They're located in a strange little spot behind the old AIP building downtown on first avenue. Seek them out. Your belly will thank you.",

The god is always wonderful, the staff is kind and effective at their job and always makes sure lunch is made fast and so it fits into your break.     Their sticky rice is especially delicious because they put coconut milk in it to make it sweet!!  Check this place out, it is the best Thai in the area.",

Normally it gets packed and has a small area for eating. Arrive early or after 1 and it will die down a little.",

I let the server know and he just took it back and brought me a new dish about 5 minutes later. I'm pretty sure I was given Pad See Ew because of how it tasted. I didn't say anything and just ate it. The food was great and service was quick but could've been better if I was given the right food.",

    "text": "The chief's mood and the service is very unsteady I think.  1) the spicy level- sometimes level 2 is two spicy, and sometimes level 6 is not spicy at all. But you can always play safe to order a low level of spiciness and ask for a side of pepper flakes  2) the amount - sometimes they make a small portion, sometimes I feel like they put two orders into one plate, today's was super big! Which is good but I got too full. Haha 3) speed - it can be fast within 5 minutes or it can be quite a wait like 20,30minutes. Maybe you colleges or friends are finishing their meal while yours just got out of kitchen.   So it really depends! But the taste is always good! Haven't been disappointed even once,  Pak kee mow is my favorite!!!",
