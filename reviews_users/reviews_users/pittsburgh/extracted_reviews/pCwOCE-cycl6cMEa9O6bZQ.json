    "text": "Great place to get a fast healthy lunch.  Their salad bar is amazing with so many options.  I love the custom option that lets you add whatever you want for a set price (with the exception of some premium items like the meats and shrimp that cost extra).  I really like how they will chop the salad for you to your desired size and add in your desired amount of salad dressing so you can get it exactly the way you want it.  I found the medium level salad dressing to be slightly heavy so I'll probably go for light in the future. They also have some breakfast sandwiches (probably not quite so healthy).  There is a soda fountain machine offering an interesting selection of natural sodas.  The line can get pretty long during peak weekday hours but it moves quickly, but if you avoid peak lunch times then you can get in and out of there pretty fast.  All the staff are friendly and the ingredients are really fresh.  There is also a small seating area.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a burger to-go. Staff were friendly and ordering process was super easy. I ordered the bistro burger and it took about 10 minutes for it to be brought out to me, which is fair for freshly made food. It was interesting that despite the to-go order, they gave me a number and told me to sit down at a table. Fortunately there were empty seats but I can imagine this might be tough if it's packed. The bistro burger was tasty, but the salt&pepper crust on the burger was way too salty. Maybe it was just a mistake on my burger, but they shouldn't be severely over salting burgers. Nonetheless, Hello Bistro will get another hello from me pretty soon to give them another chance. The build-your-own-salads are worth a shot.   Update: I went back to try the salad. I got to customize what I had it in and that's fun. After choosing everything, the salad is \"chopped\", mixed, and dressed by a chopper. I thought the personal service was really great. I got the feeling that the staff were genuinely interested in making the best salad for you. I ate the salad until I was full and had enough leftover so that by adding some lettuce, I had another lunch. I'm looking forward to saying Hello again to this place.",

It is nice to be able to get a salad with so many options, but avocado is extra money and meat is extra money?? My salad without either of those was around $7. It was okay, but I couldn't finish it all. I left it in my fridge for a couple of hours and it was completely soggy and watery and gross at the bottom. It was really disappointing, because it was pretty pricey for just a salad.",

    "text": "This is really more of a 2 1/2 star rating, and I'm only rating the salads. I feel like I should give Hello Bistro more credit for being the only make-your-own salad place around, but that doesn't automatically mean that it's got quality, delicious food. Maybe I'm spoiled from four years of living in DC, where fresh, fast salad places like Sweetgreen and Chop't (not to mention other types of amazing, delicious fast-casual cuisine places like Shophouse, BGR, Good Stuff Eatery, etc) abound. I'm used to fresh, organic, local ingredients and house-made salad dressings for a reasonable price.  Hello Bistro's produce, unfortunately, is all pretty sad-looking and tasteless. The tomatoes were pale pink and mealy, rather than red and juicy, and all the other veggies appear to come straight from a can and are floating in water. Sure, they've got a decent variety of ingredients, but they're all pretty poor in quality. Plus, what's up with the salad greens selection? I want some arugula or some baby spinach! I'm not a huge meat-eater so I didn't add any meat to my salad, but all of the meat options looked pretty lifeless. I do appreciate the unlimited number of veggie toppings and that cheese and a few meat selections are without an additional charge, though. This makes the pricing reasonable, but I expect higher quality ingredients from a $7 salad.  I want someone to open a higher quality salad place in Oakland! I would go there all the time. Sweetgreen or Chop't would probably put Hello Bistro out of business, since there are other places to get burgers. It's times like these that I wish I spent all my time in Shadyside or something, but such is the life of a med student.",

I myself enjoyed the veggie burger and a side of fries which was solid.  I don't really like how they deliver the fries in a brown bag to your seat at the restaurant-seemed aesthetically weird to me as the bag was coated with grease that soaked through, but whatever-the grease laden fries tasted great.

I enjoyed the Boylan Vintage Soda Pop, a nice refreshing change. I also checked out the kids menu, with more then one veggie option for my veggie kid (PB&J, grilled cheese and a little salad).

While the immense fresh full service salad bar seemed enticing, I opted for the Bistro Burger.  The burger came quickly after I ordered it  the patty itself was thin, think Five Guys style, but was flavorful and tender.  The toppings were very fresh and crisp; I think they came from the salad bar  All in all, the burger was well built and tasty.  Sadly the fries, while fresh and hot, seemed rather dry and didn't match the quality of the burger.  Luckily, my thirst was quenched by Boylan specialty sodas, including cane cola and Birch Beer.  The facility itself has an open and clean feel, which is impressive due to it's location.",

I never order dressing with my salads (I don't like the overwhelming flavor and they're usually pretty high in calories), so I was very surprised when I tasted how flavorful this salad was without it. Most salads are usually bland and unpalatable on their own, and rely on a strong dressing to provide flavor, but not this one.  At the end of the day, it's just a salad, but one I would be happy to eat again. I can't vouch for any of the sandwiches or burgers here, but even if you think you're \"not a salad person\", there will definitely be something here for you to try out. At $7, the price is a wee steep, but that's to be expected from a restaurant like this.",

When you order a salad you select from four different types of greens.  You can then choose from more varieties of vegetables, nuts, bacon, ham and cheese then you can imagine.  Of these, you can choose as many as you care to.  Additionally, for a small extra charge, you can choose to have a protein added.  All of this is packed into a quart size bowl.  One salad is really enough for two.  I highly recommend Hello Bistro.  I'll be going back.",

I ordered a pre-designed salad WITH DRESSING ON THE SIDE. Not a complicated order.  My salad then proceeded to sit on the counter waiting to be mixed for at least 15-20 minutes. All the workers were in the back/kitchen clearly just talking considering the restaurant had a total of 5 people in it.  Someone finally noticed I had been waiting for going on 25 minutes now, they proceeded to dump about half a bottle of dressing on my salad. The worker unapologetically handed me the salad after the 35 minute ordeal. And of course, the salad was disgusting due to the gallon of dressing on top. It was more of a dressing soup. I would have been better off waiting in the lengthily chipotle line. I probably would have been done faster and at least my order would have been done right. Worst $10 ever spent.

For this reason, it was comforting to discover Hello Bistro, a more hip offshoot of Eat'n Park, within walking distance of my workplace. I love the chili and potato soup. It's so comforting. I used to order those all the time at ENP. Their salad bar is huge and has as many options as you could possibly think of. What really draws me to this place is the Boylan's soda fountain. How cool is that? I love Boylan's soda, but sometimes it's hard to find. I wish they served regular root beer, but they have birch beer, black cherry, and ginger ale which are satisfying enough (and free refills!). It's a great lunch option in Oakland, whether you're lunching alone, getting food to go, or meeting up with a friend.  UPDATE - 4/27/16 - I would recommend only going here in the afternoon when a manager is around and things are stocked and the staff is on point. I went here for dinner at around 7 p.m. a week ago and the vegetables (and eggs?) were frozen, they were out of dried cranberries and other items, and the service was pretty bad. The students working clearly felt like they had better things to do than helping customers. Go at your own risk.",

The restaurant was typical of a college-area place, and the printed words everywhere (meal number, menu, napkins, etc.) reminded me of Chipotle.  I ordered the avocado burger; my boyfriend got the salmon burger and fries. The food took longer than I expected, considering the college-geared atmosphere. My burger was okay. It had the burger, red onion, a slice of avocado, a slice of cheese, and sauce. There was nothing special about it; also, the thick slice of avocado in only the middle of the burger made the sandwich really wide and awkward to eat. I thought the presentation--burger half-wrapped in foil--was cute, though.   I took a bite of the salmon burger, which was pretty good. However, the fries were soggy and not good at all. They came in a paper bag that was soaked in grease from the fries, which wasn't appetizing either.  If I come back, I'm going to try the salad bar, which seems much more interesting. They have many toppings to choose from, and the salad containers looked huge.",

As I walked in, I was blown away by the hipness and modernness of the decor.  The front facade has giant garage windows that open up to the outside on a bright, sunny day like the opening happened to be.  The manager greeted us with menus and a smiling face as we proceeded to gaze over the vast variety of FREE endless toppings.  The worker kindly helped me build my salad and told me what some of the unknown items were that I was gazing over.  After successfully building my ginormous salad, I decided on Citrus Lime Vinaigrette, which was one of the many dressing they have to offer.  The way they prepared the salads and then chop them up right in front of you really creates an intimate experience.  On a side note, the fountain drinks are Boylan Vintage Sodas, and they are extremely delicious!  My salad was all that I hoped it to be.  I cannot believe I received a huge shrimp salad with as many toppings as I wanted including a variety of cheese for all $9.00.  Not to mention, I finished my meal up with a yummy milkshake that made my stomach very happy.  I cannot wait to come back!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times.  I always get the salad, since I'm not a (beef) burger eater.  Pros: (1) Make-your-own salad concept: This is the only place I've been to in PGH that does it (2) Boylan soda fountain: I recommend the orange and cream sodas in particular (3) E'n P potato soup: Always a solid option (4) Fries: Though I've never ordered them, I've tried them from friends who have, and I believe they're fresh cut (albeit a bit on the greasy side) (5) Location: Convenient to Pitt and Presby (also, a healthier alternative to much of what's served at the Presby cafeteria--can't speak for Pitt...)  Cons (1) Salad content: Roughly 75% lettuce (2) Salad quality: It's okay, but nothing that blew me away, despite having tried both the make-your-own and preset versions (3) Price: $7.50 seems a bit steep for a salad that's mostly lettuce (see above).  As of the last time I visited, they were running a email coupon promo that you could access via a QR code, however. (4) Crowding: If you go for lunch during the school year, it can be hard to get a table (but then again, what place on Forbes or Fifth doesn't have this problem?)  Overall, an okay option for lunch in Oakland, esp. for those trying to eat healthier.  3.5 stars.",

As far as salad bars go Hello Bistro has several things in their favor.  First, their staff will create the salad for you behind a glass barrier so you don't have people stuffing their fat hands into the toppings.  So it's a nice clean process.  Secondly, the options for salad toppings are endless and very fresh.  Edamame?  Yes!  Hearts of Palm?  Yes!  And the list goes on and on.  Finally, they have a nice selection of salad dressings ranging from tasty and healthy to really tasty and very fattening.  And then the staff person that is helping you will cut the salad to your preference.  Prefer tiny little salad bites?  Not a problem.  Want your salad with a medium chop?  You've got it.  And they also shake it like a Polaroid picture for you so you have an even distribution of toppings.    Other items range from burgers, soup, and grilled cheeses.  The turkey burger I had was tasty.  These items do not come with a side.  So if you want fries n'at, you'll pay a little more.  Hello Bistro also has a hip soda machine.  And I mean that it isn't the typical Coke or Pepsi selection; here you can find cream soda.  That's right, cream soda.",

Burger was awful, the brioche bun wasn't buttered or toasted, it had way too much lettuce on it, the bacon was limp, the onions weren't caramelizad and the patty was somehow both overcooked and cold at the same time. The fries had way too much pepper on them and some were crispy while others were practically raw.

You basically order a salad ($7.50 without protein), and then you can tell them all of the toppings you want - everything from roasted chickpeas to eggs, edamame and blue cheese. Protein toppings include pork, chicken, steak and tofu. Their dressings are interesting and full of flavor. My favorite is the pesto vinaigrette. I typically get a salad with romaine, mushrooms, egg, edamame, blue cheese, almonds, cranberries and the pesto dressing.   Their grilled cheeses and sandwiches are also rather inventive. I like their veggie burger, but last time I went I ordered the 2-alarm burger with a veggie patty sub, and it wasn't that exciting. Maybe I wasn't in the mood. It's usually fantastic.   Their fries come in a massive portion for $2, and they are my favorite part of Hello Bistro. I can't help it, I'm a potato junkie. They're skinny and crispy and just full of yum!   The natural-soda fountain is also fantastic. I usually try one of each, but birch beer is my favorite. Their cream soda is also fabulous when you mix it with the orange soda. Yummy!   Their current milkshake special is a strawberry-mango milkshake. It was to die for.   Hello Bistro staff is always friendly and helpful. I love the environment, I love the food. I am excited about this place, and I hope it continues to grow!",

I liked the menu options and salad bar for those building their own salads is displayed well,  albeit no labeling. The reason for knocking off a point however is, in my very last bite I either bit in to a stone or a raw grain. That was highly unpleasant.",

It puts every salad I get at another restaurant to shame, as the toppings are endless and so deliciously fresh. I tend to leave feeling full, but not post-Chipotle-burrito stuffed. Quinoa, endamame, fresh blueberries, Kalamata olives, fresh mozzarella balls-- essentially everything you would find in a dream salad bar.   I'm sure the other reviewers have summed up how great this place is, so I'll leave it at this: hungry for vegetables? Go to Hello Bistro. Thirsty for vintage, real-sugar (no HFCS) pop?

I usually try to avoid making lists like these, but rather than write 5 paragraphs, I thought I'd give you the breakdown.   Good:  Fresh ingredients.  You can get any salad combination you can think of.  Eat there every day and you never have to eat the same thing twice.  Boylan Soda on fountan!  All you can drink!  Yes, you read me correctly.  Not Pepsi...Not Coke.  Boylan.  Amazing.  The fries are a little soggy, but overall tasty.  Friendly staff (so far anyway - the place is too new for the employees to become jaded and miserable yet).  They actually serve beer and wine - that's nice, but I'm not sure that it was necessary.  The chalkboard wall is a fun concept.  Not so good:  Cold proteins.  Some people like chilled chicken and other meats on their salads so this might not be as much of an issue, but I prefer my chicken to be warmed up so it will melt the cheese just slightly.  The lunch rush is CRAZY and school hasn't even started yet.  I'd hate to see how busy this place will get on a weekday afternoon once the college kids return.  Final verdict:  The PIC and I will definitely be back for an early dinner perhaps, but we will definitely avoid lunching there on weekdays.",

If you want anything else in the world, don't go here (they have other menu items, but nothing that can't be beat elsewhere).  I will give a special mention of their beverage selection.  Pretty good unsweetened iced tea sits next to a fountain with multiple Boylan brand (whoops) sodas.  Better than your normal soft drink offerings.  (Oh, and because you have to basically go down the counter with someone as he or she makes your salad, I think it would be a hard place to go with groups, since there will be substantial lag in between the times the first and last people receive their salads--though it's not as big a problem as it would be at other restaurants, since you don't have to worry about your salad getting cold.)",

They reduced the size of the salad boxes - not too bad, it is still pretty big for me.  2. This is the unstated rule that annoys me (and my friends) -  Half the box MUST be filled with lettuce. Now, when I told them I dont want lettuce (i dont LIKE lettuce), the senior guy (possibly the manager) goes into a long rant as to why they would lose money if it is not filled with lettuce. It would be useful if it is explicitly stated, so people like lettuce  dont go there. Why would anyone pay for something that they dont want to eat ?  3. They started reducing normal serving sizes (presumably to save cost)- these days, I find myself repeating \"some more, some more,some more....\" soo many times !

Walked back to get it swapped for something else (they were out of their other soups, as it was late in the evening). I opted for a $4 breakfast sandwich. The manager was unwilling to compensate me in any other way than by deducting the price of the soup from what I was getting (which was $1.50 more than the soup). He insulted me by offering an order of fries instead (which was worth less than the soup). I wasted 10 minutes twice waiting for the food and another 10 minutes walking back. You can't treat a customer like that. I wasn't asking for the world. I was forced to pay full price for something I didn't originally want after having walked back and forth and waiting for it to be prepared.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the salad that I got at Hello Bistro today--the ingredients were nice and fresh and there were tons of options to add to your salad.  It's a nice addition to the Oakland area lunch options, and I think it was pretty reasonably priced for the size of the salads.  I also was a big fan of the Boylan Soda machine--it's nice to have different selections for fountain drinks.  The only complaint I have was how crowded it seemed to be--like there were too many people working all at once.  It was also hard for the staff to hear you as you ordered things to put in the salad, but I ended up with everything on my salad that I wanted--so I can't complain too much, but I can imagine this problem only getting worse when all the students return to both Pitt and CMU.",

    "text": "We decided on Hello Bistro one day last weekend. I had been putting off going here because I never really found myself in the mood for a salad. Yes, i thought the only thing Hello Bistro had was a giant salad bar.  Both of us decided on a burger and fries. Decent burger and pretty sweet options to choose from, especially the breakfast sandwiches (which are served all day). I really enjoy the fresh cut fries.. and at $2 it cant really be beat. That's pretty much the price of a half-full bag of funyuns, haha.   Kudos to HB for having a ranch dispenser from the girl who eats ranch. with. everything. ! The Boylan Soda fountain was a nice touch too!  Next time, I'm going to try the salad. I couldnt make up my mind this past Sunday and didn't want to hold up my party, which is why I decided on the burger. I think its pretty sweet that HB has a salad bar + a menu with that has cool salad ideas already created! (salads by us) there are some pretty interesting options there.. Same is True for the regular salad bar (salads by you)   By the way, remember at the beginning of this review i stated \"i never really found myself in the mood for a salad\"... wellllllll, since heading here, i've been patiently waiting to head back for a salad...... & I brought home their menu, so I often find myself staring at the fridge at the HB salad menu! aah  We shall return and i'll update my salad experience.  I wonder if a HB will ever have a location downtown. That'd be pretty sweet.",

I tolerated the fact that I kept finding remnants of items I didn't order in my salad (luckily I don't have any allergies). I also tolerated that I wouldn't get all the ingredients that I ordered. HOWEVER, I CANNOT TOLERATE A HAIR in my salad. I should have known better when I went there last week, in person, early in the day to order my salad (and still wait a long time). The place didn't look clean and the staff looked very unprofessional. After my disgusting experience of finding the hair, I tried to call the restaurant to speak with the manager (this was take-out), but nobody even answered the phone. I sent them an email via their website, but nobody responded. This place is unhygienic. What a shame. Expensive, disgusting, no thanks. You've lost me as a customer.",

I was disappointed to receive nothing but a grilled cheese sandwich for what I paid, but my husband and I could only eat half of his Buffalo chicken salad between us, so a salad is definitely the most economical option. The restaurant was noisy, but the Buffalo seasoning is very well done. Even at a bust dinnertime in a Friday the eat-in wait was not very long.",

Then when i got there they tried to blame me when I don't eat red meat so why in the world would i ask for it. They were so rude when i had to walk back to get my new food. On top of that it took so long to get my new meal. Terrible Customer service and I do not want to return after that Piada is right across the street with better customer service. Yeah",

I think you can't go wrong because they have premade options or you can create your own with whatever you like.

Surprisingly the cashier said that it was impossible because it is a predesigned salad. I find it ironic that a place that prides itself on customizable salads can't even just make this simple adjustment. Nevertheless I took the salad with kale, rather than replicating the entire salad with spinach instead via the salad bar.  The discrepancy between the amount of salad portrayed on the picture and what I received was apparent. They didn't even fill it to the plastic brim, whereas other people's salads were overflowing.   Despite my criticisms, the salad was good. The avocado, edamame, and soba noodles were a unique way to spice up a salad. The Thai peanut dressing was slightly sweet, but didn't overpower the salmon or toppings.",

    "text": "Very filling and customizable salads! ...but overly priced and the service is terrible. I usually customize my own salad when I go and it always fills me up. The price is usually around $9-10, which is a lot for a salad. But their burgers and fries aren't too bad, in taste and in price. The service on the other hand is a completely different story. One time I came in about an hour to an hour and a half before they closed and no one was at the front of the house. There were people in the kitchen who made eye contact with me but didn't say anything to reassure my anxiety. I ended up standing there for about 15 mins to 20 mins before someone came to serve me. The service I received also was not very friendly, as he didn't apologize for my long wait. Even with a busy day or not, there was always a long enough wait that I would take note of. Would only come back if I was really craving a salad (which is very rare) or was coerced into going.  tldr; food 7/10 service 1.5/10 interior 9/10 (lots of seating)",

I wasn't in a rush, but certainly wouldn't have wanted to wait in the line that extended out the door.  Granted that make your own salad option is choice.  The cashier explained to me what to do (since I'd only been to another location for Superburger combos) and I couldn't wait to tell them to add, well, almost everything.  A little of this, a little of that...and then with a medium chop and just a drizzle of the ranch dressing I couldn't even tell what all was in there.  And I loved every bite of it!  You start with lettuce (mixed greens, kale, romaine, spinach) and then they top it with any and all toppings at no additional charge.  Even though meats are extra, I splurged on the salmon for $3.  This was possibly the most amazing salad I've ever eaten for $11.  It can get crazy and messy in there, but they keep things loving at a pretty steady pace.  I was impressed with the way they kept it all organized with dine in and take out orders all coming in at the same time.  My only concern is that it could be cleaner with how fast they chop those salads.",

Almost no chicken whatsoever.  Dressing was overwhelming.  - What chicken that was in salad was under-cooked.    - Not worth it.  Expensive and almost ALL Kale. No chicken, no spinach, ...  Just Kale and dressing.  Not sure why it took them so long to prepare.  Much better salads elsewhere.",

As someone with a restricted diet the fact that I can get a gluten free bun and meat alternatives is great. I love their fries and the portion sizes for everything else is better than most places, the only downside which is worth a lot in my opinion is the customer service. If you order a menu salad you're often getting your food behind customers who order a custom salad because they take them first. The other thing that happens EVERY SINGLE TIME when you order for pickup, is that you never get your food on time. It's usually either 15-30 minutes late which is just ridiculous considering you're ordering with the intention of efficiency",

The portion size is quite large, so it definitely a salad as a meal, especially with a protein added. People behind the counter were friendly and helpful while I made decisions. It was a late afternoon, but the place was still pretty hopping and everything moved along quickly. It looked like they also had some pretty good burgers and hand cut fries, but we were in a salad mood. My only complaint it that the dining area was not really clean.

When you have online ordering in a very busy place not having people only working on the online orders defeats the purpose entirely. The last three times I've been the wait times have ended up being 35, 30, and 40 minutes. If it's going to be that long fine, figure out a way to work it into your online ordering system, get Eat n Park to pony up and join grubhub or eatstreet that can give actual estimates instead of always saying 20 minutes.   It won't stop me from eating here, but I'm sure it's going to stop people who aren't lucky enough to work across the street and have actual time crunches on their lunch breaks.",

They have so many toppings i could never list all of them. Sometimes I have to ask for extra of a certain topping as they might just give you a tiny bit, but they never say no. They ask you how finely chopped you'd like your salad and how heavily dressed too. You have a lot of delicious dressing to choose from but the chipotle citrus bbq is my favorite. The salads are also so big that sometimes we'll go and split a salad and some fries if we're feeling it.   The inside has all metal chairs and some low and high tables. With the amount of traffic that goes through this location, sometimes it looks like the place could be cleaner. But if you eat in the restaurant you just leave your food on the table when you are done and they come clean it up for you which is really nice. I also like that they have ranch next to the drink machine and little sauce to-go containers that you can fill and take with you. Genius.

The salads are seriously huge, I really don't know how they pack so much into one container, but I always have trouble finishing it entirely (although I usually force myself to because it's so good!). I also like the option of cutting the salads into large/medium/small pieces (I like small) and I like having the heavy/medium/light option for dressing too (medium thanks!).   They have a huge amount of toppings, as well as a variety of dressings (in my opinion, they most important part of a salad!). My current jam has been the poppyseed dressing, but I didn't see it as an option the last time I ordered a salad, so I hope they didn't take it off the menu. I always opt for the kale mix, and that wasn't an option either. So I'm not sure if they were just out that day or what was up but I'm hoping both are back on.   Let's be honest though, the only thing I ever want to eat from here is that famous Eat n' Park ranch!",

On this particular visit my girls and I came for the burgers however.  My wife and I both chose the Original E'nP Superburger with fries and our daughter chose the Mushroom & Onion Jack Burger with fries. A few minutes later our food was on the table. My wife and I's burgers were just as good as ever as they were always our go to's at Eat N' Park. The fries were delicious also. Our daughter was quiet the whole time so I take it she enjoyed her burger as well!  It's nice to have a different option for burgers other than Burger King or Wendy's. Next time I will try one of their salads as they sound very good as well!",

I load up my mixed greens with all of my favorite veggies (mushrooms, carrots, celery, bell peppers, garbanzo beans, soy beans, and the roasted vegetable of the day) along with some quinoa and Asiago cheese. And of course don't forget to add your favorite crunchies to the mix!! I've been getting salads here for 4 years now and my favorite all time dressing is the Thai peanut sauce--it just adds so much flavor to a bowl full of fresh greens!   Pro tips: make your own salad, load up on veggies (it makes the price of the sale worth it), and don't come during rush hour when the college students dominate the lines",

Citrus Lime Vinaigrette with fresh and crunchy kale, spinach, and quinoa was delicious. Sunflower seeds were a great addition to the salad.   I highly recommend trying this place.

The first instance my friend and I shared a California scrambler ($5!!) and fries ($2). The fries were thin and plentiful, and the people behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating when I asked for mayo.  The second time my friend got a John Wayne BBQ Burger ($6.50) and fries and we were able to finish it comfortably. Looking at most of their menu items they seem to offer many health aware options such as turkey burgers and creating your own salad. The place is affordable and convenient. Definitely great for college students who are looking to fill their stomachs and not overeat while not spending a fortune!",

I created my own salad with salmon as my protein. Seriously soooo many toppings to choose from. I had a hard time passing up any of them. I also ordered a kids meal for my daughter- grilled cheese, fries, milk and a smiley cookie for $5. Yes $5!!!! Seriously such a good deal.  We came in their off peak season since Pitt students were gone for the summer. With that said there was no wait to order and parking was easy. All a plus.  One thing I thought was strange was the fact that they have a family restroom but no high chairs. I get this is smack in the middle of college town but there were several other families there and you made a point to have a family restroom. There should be high chairs.  Food is good though so I will be back. I will just be better prepared with my daughter next time if we dine in.",

Fries were only an additional $2 so I figured why not. The wait for our food took longer than we thought but it wasn't a terrible wait. The burger was super good and very tasty. The pepperoni was a great ingredient in the burger. The fries were the thin type and had a good amount of grease on them where they weren't gross. I absolutely recommend this place to others. They even have salads that you can order as is or even make yourself! Those looked really good and very big and filling. They have literally anything for everyone.",

Once you pick everything, they chop it and give you dressing. The salad was what I thought to be a big portion, much bigger than Panera and customized to what you want.  This is a great concept. I'm sure the place will do well. I'm told at lunch the line is already out the door and its not even the school year yet...

After working a 12-13 hour day at the hospital, I want something quick that I can pick up and take home, but I don't want it to be heavy and fried.  The salad bar is ideal.  You get to choose your lettuce then a myriad of toppings and a protein for about $9.  The price is a little steep for a salad, but with the amount of food you get, I think it's well worth it.  Personally, I suggest the citrus chipotle BBQ dressing.  It's so good!  If you're choosing between chicken and steak, choose the chicken.  The steak I found to be a bit chewy and flavorless-but the chicken is delicious!  I've also had the italian grilled cheese which was delicious.  Can't go wrong here!",

    "text": "First let me say they opened last week so I understand there may be some kinks to work out but it was pretty bad. From the first moments inside we felt a sense confusion and of being rushed.  I ordered a burger, fries and a side salad and told to go to the dressing station and someone will get you the dressing of your choice along with an order number to put on the table.  I waited in line for 10 minutes at the dressing station before interrupting someone to get my dressing (my meal was delivered to me while waiting in line).  The place was packed and we waited another 10 minutes for a table to clear. You could see many unhappy faces from the customers but the staff was remarkably upbeat. The food: Their marketing reads \"Yes, we've been flippin' burgers since 1949 - you don't do something for that long without getting preeeetty good at it.\".  The burger tasted like a processed frozen burger from a cafeteria, it was bland & spongy. The salad was nice but the red wine vinaigrette tasted like something out of a bottle.  Not what I was expecting.  If you're looking for good burgers, walk a bit further and go to 5 guys.  If you like salads they have a great selection but I suspect the dressings are pretty much off the shelf. Someone that I had lunch with told me said the food is straight from Eat and Park so if that's your taste you might like it.",

    "text": "I feel like I can't accurately comment on Hello Bistro because their big selling point is the made to order salads and I ordered a burger. Let's start with something simple and talk about seating. We went down here for a late lunch (1:30) one day. The place was packed, as most places in Oakland are. We ordered take out. The problem with this is you have to find a place to locate yourself until your take out order is ready. There were no table and no barstools available so we ended up awkwardly asking a group if we could hang at their table for a few minutes until our orders were ready. Luckily they were quick and our order was up within five minutes. I ordered the avocado veggie burger and fries as a side. It was nothing special and I could literally make a better burger at home. Maybe I'm just kind of a burger snob because I find most burger places to be highly unsatisfactory (Burgatory, such a disappointment). This burger was just a standard veggie patty, a slice of swiss cheese, an overabundance of onion, two chunks of avocado and some ketchup. It was kind of bland. The fries were extremely greasy. My friend ordered a salad and her food was actually much better. This place is definitely at it's best when you get a salad. You can personalize it however you'd like.  I had a few bites and the salad seemed to be a much tastier option. I was just lured in by the promise of a burger with avocado. Next time I'm sticking with salads and that's that!  I think this place is a little bit pricey for the quality you're getting but it looks like I'm in the minority on that one. Not my favorite place in Oakland but not the worst either!",

The toppings are absolutely incredible and the salads themselves are so big you can easily get two meals out of it. However, please allot plenty of time as the salad bar line can take up to 15 minutes by the time it's all chopped and mixed. It is on the pricier side, but you get to put as many toppings as you would like. I highly recommend and it's one of the bests casual restaurants in Oakland.",

You go in and you can pick from 6 types of greens (I opt for kale and spinach) they offer proteins which includes tofu for vegetarians like myself and anything else you could imagine for salad toppings. They mix it all up as much as you want and add dressing for a huge meal that will keep you full and not feel like an unhealthy jerk when you're done. Also, other side note items, the fries are pretty outstanding and also the soda fountain is like \"boutique\" real sugar soda from some independent brand. Highly recommend for a fast meal in Oakland.",

Sometimes you just really want a salad and Hello Bistro is there to save your day!  So, for $9 you get all the fixins including gourmet toppings like avocado!  The proteins they offer also cater to vegans and vegetarians in that they offer tofu!  I love that they offer dried cranberries and toasted walnuts.  What's also great is you can switch up the salad every time you come here.  They have lots of different dressings and you can sample all of them to see which one you like.  The salad is REALLY filling but if you have room I do suggest ordering the fries.  They're pretty darn delicious but after the one time I ordered fries and a salad I learned the hard way that I can only have room for the one or the other - and the salad wins!  Seriously, check it out!  You can make your salad as crazy or simple as you like it.   Hard to believe this place is owned by Eat n Park.  Oh, and they serve beer and wine!",

My only gripes are that the steak I got was ICE COLD, too chunky and a bit fibrous (yuck).  My lunchmate had the \"grilled\" chicken and it had zero seasoning (yuck too).  There's enough variety to the rest of the fixins that you don't need the $2 \"protein\" so don't bother.  Oh, and there's no baby spinach (boo!).  One major tip:  at the start, tell them to only fill the bowl with lettuce 3/4 of the way.  Otherwise, you'll run out of room for all the other \"fixins\" you'll want.  Oh, and the wonton chips, croutons, cranberries and sunflower seeds are at the end, just so you know.    Oh, and if you're a fan of cream soda, the Boylan fountain is something special.  About my salad:  It was designed by me, down to the number of times it was tossed and chopped, so how could it ever not be great?  Of course, that's kind of the idea.",

Football games, skipping class, laying on the Cathedral lawn, eating at Hello Bistro...  NOT.  Had Hello Bistro opened in Oakland during my tenure there I most certainly would've stayed ANOTHER seven years in college.  It's SOOO delicious.  I ordered a make-your-own type of salad and bellied up to the salad bar to have one of Hello's salad artists create my concoction.  Starting with romaine I'm pretty sure I used at LEAST 40 of the 50 or so toppings available.  From three types of olives, wasabi peas and crisp granny smith apples, I was in some serious salad heaven.  Then, they took me and my monstrous salad to the chopping block where they chopped it up to my size specification: \"small bites, big bites, or somewhere in between?\"  Somewhere in between - oh yeah. Amazing.  I eat salads all the time. I have NEVER left a single shred of lettuce behind, yet this was one exception. The thing was just too big.  It probably didn't help that I noshed a bit on the delightfully-spiced French fries that accompanied my guest's Chunky Monkey Peanut Butter and *I want this in my face* Jelly sandwich.  Mmmm, mmm, mmm.  I can't wait to go back and try every last item on that mouth-watering menu.  And did I mention that they serve Boylan's soda, the greatest soda pop to ever grace the planet?!

Hello Bistro is one of my go-tos for dinner. It's a little pricey at ~$10 with meat, but it's not a bad deal if you stack the toppings. Plus, you get to make it any way you want, which is always a plus. And the staff always obliges if you ask for a little extra of a few things.  Some friends have ordered the burgers and fries. They were so-so it seems. If you come here, I would definitely recommend the salad over everything else.",

The manager was chopping my salad and admitted they were NOT prepared for how busy they've been--not sure why, as Pitt's medical, nursing, and public health schools are all right around the corner--not to mention the three large hospitals!  There are some health-minded people that have been deprived of health restaurant choices for quite some time...  Anyway, the food.  I did the \"create your own\" salad, where someone walks you through the bar and adds veggies, cheeses, and proteins at your instruction.  They then add a dressing, mix it all up, chop it, and fill a to-go container.    Bonus points for the \"vintage\" Boylan's soda fountain--YUM!

A little disappointing that you have to buy the fries separately but I get the concept. I usually go for the make your own salad which is nothing less than incredible. They have a ridiculous amount of options to choose from and you can build the salad to however you're feeling. They chop it up for you, add dressing, and mix it up. I would describe it as a Chipotle with just salad. I'm not sure what makes it so good. Maybe it's because I'm too lazy to mix my own salad so this is hassle free? Maybe it's because it tastes amazing everytime?  Everyone that works here is so nice and friendly; the customer service is reason enough to come back.",

    "text": "After strong deliberation of where to eat for lunch in Oakland, we found ourselves at Hello Bistro and I'm glad we did.  Although they have hamburgers and fries, which might be good, the reason to go is the build your own salad for a base of $7.50 currently.  If you add protein in the form of chicken, etc. it is an additional cost, but it isn't needed.  There is enough options to replace the meat in black beans, garbanzo beans, edamame that you won't miss the beef or chicken.  Obviously price is an opinion whether it is worth it or not, but for me, the price wasn't bad at all especially compared to other restaurants in the area to get salads.  The other complaint is that EnP is the parent company and same ingredients.  Although I have not been to HB much, the produce looked \"fresher\" than the pale looking produce at your local EnP, or maybe it is just mine where the produce used as decoration looked more edible than some of the stuff on the salad bar.  Also, a lot of the items used at EnP said \"EnP\" next to them, like the ranch dressing or cookies specifically stated EnP.  I have never seen Pesto Vinaigrette at EnP.  If you are still with me and are curious, this is how it works even though i was a little confused at first.  This build your own salad is for one price with protein being the only addition item.  There is no circling what you want and handing them the card or curious if the roasted corn is 50 cents more than the regular corn.  Basically, you pay and off you go.  First, they ask what type of lettuce you want (mixed greens, romaine, iceberg) then they head over to where all the toppings are and you just go crazy telling them everything you want (I had broccoli, cauliflower, egg, bacon, roasted corn, roasted root veggies, granny smith apples, edamame, fresh mozzarella, and kalamata olives).  Second, they pass you on to what I describe as \"the chopper.\"  I'm not sure if that is the official title or not but they ask if you want your salad chopped small, medium, or large.  I love this step because instead of eating giant leaves of lettuce, it can be cut small.  Also, at this step they add the crunchies of which i had the toasted garbanzos and sunflower seeds.  Finally this person asks what type of dressing and how much or if  you want it on the side.  I watched as he dressed it to just the right amount, enough to coat the salad but not too much to form a lettuce soup.  Also, if you want more after the fact, you can go back and ask for more.  I had the pesto vinaigrette, which was good, but i would probably try another type next time.  I know people have said the salads are huge, and this is definitely the case.  The pictures don't do it justice.  As an added bonus, Boylan's in the fountain.  Even though I don't drink soda anymore, i almost had to get it to try the Birch Beer or the Cherry.",

The toppings are okay, nothing impressive.  The dressings are so so.  They charge way too much for salmon and avocado and tofu... I personally think at LEAST avocado or tofu should be a free add on if eggs and bacon are.  They need more people working, as this place is always busy and the employees always backed up, whether they're friendly or not.",

The salad selecting, chopping, and mixing process is really fun... and makes a darn tasty salad!  Also, consider having your salad \"finely chopped.\" Every bite is packed with delicious flavor with no enormous pieces of lettuce to fight.   The fries are great!

This is a favorite spot of mine in case you can't tell. I go after the gym for a healthy meal or during lunch hours at work.

So when I first heard about Hello Bistro, I was skeptical, knowing they were part of the ENP family. I'm glad I gave it a try, because these salads are monstrous! For a flat $7 charge, you can create your own salad from seemingly endless toppings. I like that they offer tofu for the vegetarian crowd, but I've never felt the need to indulge after all of the other goodies I've selected. These salads are HUGE. I'm not sure how a person could finish one of these in one sitting. They just added quinoa to a long line of salad goodies which makes me happy. The standard fare are represented (carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc), along with some less prevelant salad bar items. You will be prompted by one of the friendly staff about how you would like your salad chopped. Small bites? Medium? Larger bites? Just tossed? Who has even given this much thought to salads before!? Now for the crunchies. Sure, you could get croutons, but I like the pumpkin seeds, slivered almonds, fried onion straws and dried cranberries for some needed crunch and texture. Hello Bistro has 14 different dressings to choose from. To date I've tried only two, the Asian Sesame and citrus lime vinaigrette. It will be difficult for me to stray from the latter from here on out, it was amazing, and I don't really even like salad dressing. Seriously, what is with people and ranch dressing??  I haven't tried the veggie burger or other sandwiches. I probably won't. I really like the salads. It's a quick walk down to Hello Bistro from work, so the next time I'm craving a really big salad, I know where I'll be heading.",

    "text": "There for the first time and had something besides a salad. I opted for the burger and french fries. I got to John Wayne burger which comes with sauteed onions and barbecue sauce. The burger it's probably even worse than McDonald's burger and it was a very cheap burger. I would rather go to five guys any day of the week.  The fries were terrible. Way too much spice and salt. I could not even eat them. When ordering I asked if that would be in one order be enough to share with three people and they said yes. Clearly the people that work there have no clue because it was barely enough for one person no less sharing it for three people.  The worst part of the experience with how dirty the place was this is the first time we've ever dining in the restaurant and clearly all the college kids have no clue how to clean up. And the manager should know better and making it it's staff clean the place.   When we left the restaurant there was a employee cleaning the windows which was probably the last thing that needed to be done and they could be wiping up the tables cleaning up french fries all over the floors even the trash bin was overflowing it was disgusting.  We were the only ones in line and it took over 20 minutes to get two salads.  I will never be back again.",

Since I live a 45 minute walk from Hello Bistro, I don't feel like trekking all the way back in the rain to complain. If you don't want to get ripped off, there is no avoiding standing in line and supervising the \"salad artist's\" every motion to ensure that you get the toppings you paid for. Or, upon getting the brown paper bag with your online order, you must open the bowl of salad and inspect it VERY carefully to check that everything you paid for is there. Also, don't forget to pick up utensils and napkins yourself, because the brown paper bag that they shove at you has none of that.",

Though the line can be ridiculously long during a weekday lunch, I still come here from time to time to get my salad fix.   One thing I noticed that they changed is the way they do their to-go salads. Before, you would walk in, order, and go through the salad bar line with someone and choose your toppings regardless of if you made your own or chose of their premade salads. At the end they would ask if it was for here or to go and box it up accordingly.   Today when I ordered my old standby to go, excited to add a bunch of other stuff on it, I was given a number and told my salad would be brought out to me upon paying. After a few \"um, wut?\" minutes of confusion, my salad was brought out to me overdressed and barren of all of the delicious num nums I've come to crave. Luckily the staff was super DUPER accomodating when I said inquired about the change and made me the salad I wanted at no extra charge and no 'tude. Woot!",

Alas, I could not try one of their appetizing looking sandwiches or get a big pile of fries that particular day - not unless I wanted to be up and sick as a dog all night. So I had to go the healthy route, and ordered a salad instead.  Let it be known that Hello Bistro really must be good if I don't have any regrets or resentment since I more or less was required to eat salad for dinner - health reasons and whatnot always get in my way, it seems. But I was happy to find that their Mediterranean salad is a delicious and a great alternative to a greasy burger or whatnot. It was just a big bowl filled with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, and dressing, but the simplicity really didn't matter considering how fresh the greens were. It had the fresh taste and crisp crunch that you'd expect from a good salad. The portion sizing was a bit over the top, but these guys do have the sense to serve their giant salads in plastic bowls that just need a lid and are ready to go home with you. It's so simple, but I really like the fact that we didn't have to wait after eating to get another container and pack up my food. Really, my only complaint about my meal was that the salad had waaaay too many olives, but now I know better for future reference.  Keeping me from giving the place 5 stars is the simple fact that I really don't find this place super exceptional; it's a great cheap-eats spot that's pretty darn popular because it's cheap-eats. But the food isn't the best thing ever. It IS, however, better than what you'll find in a lot of other Oakland cheap-eat spots, which is probably why so many students pop in here so often.  On a final note, my friend definitely loved his sandwich as much as I enjoyed my salad, so next time, I'm planning ahead, not coming here after I eat too much in advance, and giving myself the chance to try some of what smelled so darn good when I walked in here!",
