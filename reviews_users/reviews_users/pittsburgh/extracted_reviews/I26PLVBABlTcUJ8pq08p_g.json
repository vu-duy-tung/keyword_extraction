    "text": "We made the foolish mistake of trying to spend our Groupon at Penn Brewery on a Saturday, without a reservation.  Daunted by the wait, and bellies hungry for delicious comfort food, my boyfriend I were sullenly driving back toward home when we remembered - isn't there a little Irish bar just off the main drag of the Strip District?  Let's go investigate.  So investigate we did, I'd say around 730 on a Saturday night.  It was oddly quiet and uncrowded inside - a few tables here and there, but no big groups gathered around to watch a game over drinks, or eat dinner.  There was lots of Irish paraphernalia on the walls, but the harsh lighting and widely spaced tables made the bar feel a bit uninviting.  A little dimness could've gone a long way!  We got some beer on draft - a Harp for me - and started with the fried pickles, which were served with honey mustard.  They were.....fried pickles.  They were served as whole spears, not bite-size pieces, so sometimes the breading would slide off, but they were hot and tasty with the tangy mustard.  Good size appetizer portion.  Both craving something authentic, my boyfriend got the fish 'n' chips, and I got the corned beef and cabbage.  Both were utterly no frills.  My boyfriend lauded their authenticity, and I have to confess, the fish 'n' chips were spot on.  Especially the fish.  That taste!  It took me back to my semester studying abroad in England, eating fish 'n' chips out of a paper cone.  It didn't need anything fancy or unique to dress it up - it was great as it was.  He was hugely satisfied.  I was underwhelmed with my corned beef and cabbage.  While I won't question the authenticity, the overall effect was that the food was plain.  Well-cooked, and in a good portion, but not really crave-worthy.  There were some vegetables on the side as well, everything prepared with utter simplicity.  I enjoyed the taste, but after a few bites, I wanted something more.  It was a large portion, so I took some home, but we weren't even motivated to reheat it.  It didn't really do it for me.   Apologies to Ireland if that's how this dish was meant to be prepared - if that's the case, I suppose it just wasn't my thing.  We started to leave just as a few musicians came in.  I think I'd enjoy coming back here for a drink and an appetizer during some live Irish music!  Service was a bit slow, but if I was there to relax and unwind for a few hours, I wouldn't mind at all.",

    "text": "We went this past weekend for the oyster and guinness event.  Honestly, the guinness and the other beer we tried tasted a bit flat or wattered down.  The fish and chips were so soggy with oil that it was puddling on the plate.  I could not beleive that they sent it out like that.  Obviously the fryer was not hot enough and it was not edible.   The oyster po boy was fine, so that must have been made in a different fryer.  We had to split that sandwich and then later split the second order (we went for a burger, which was actually pretty good), which made for a less enjoyable experience. The staff was very nice, although I think that they could have used one more person for this event.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks because they were so busy, and this was at 3:30 in the afternoon!",

We made it for breakfast on parade day, had a fine breakfast there (eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, potatoes for 8 bucks), then left for the parade.  We returned around noon, and they wanted 10 clams a piece to come back in and drink $6 Guinness out of a plastic cup.  I just couldn't do it, and neither could the rest of my party.  I also don't appreciate that the cover charges are never mentioned in their e-mail newsletter. I know a man's gotta make that money, but sheesh!",

I usually get the steak salad which used to be good.  The last 4 times getting it, I have had issues.  One time it will be a nice full meal and other times it looks like a kids salad and for $13, that isn't worth it.  Last time I went for take out, my bill was $13 and some change.  I gave the bartender $15 and only received $1 back.  She decided to keep the rest of my change and acted like it was owed to her.  I didn't say anything but was bothered that she would assume that she could have my change.  Today, even though I said that I wouldn't go again, I was craving a salad and have little time for lunch.  I asked for medium cooked steak and it is BEYOND well done.  It is actually crispy.  The French fries on top are rock hard but are not burnt which seems to me to be recooked from yesterday.  I cannot eat this.  I will certainly walk the extra few blocks from now on to get food that is prepared properly.   Never again for me.",

Our server had no personality and appeared to be covering the entire restaurant - albeit there were only about five tables full of guests. She was impatient when taking our order and rushed away from the table. We ordered pretzels for an appetizer and didn't receive them until after our food came out. We waited over 35 minutes for our food (THERE WERE  ONLY FIVE TABLES OF PEOPLE!) only to be served luke warm food - at best. This was the worst fish and chips we've ever had.  The fish was fried with the skin on and was so tough we couldn't even break it with a fork. The fair-style fresh cut fries were cold and shriveled and the pretzels (that we received after our food) appeared just be heated frozen pretzels.  Our waitress never refilled our waters (we also had beer) and never returned to our table after the food was dropped off. When we asked for a refill on the water and were deciding on dessert she was short with us and snapped \"just tell me how many waters you want' that made our dessert decision pretty easy. Bad service, terrible food and it was like a slap in the face to pay the $60 bill. The only redeeming qualities were the draft cider and nice side salad. Certainly not enough to return to this establishment.",

    "text": "Before catching Soilwork at Altar Bar one recent evening, I decided to bring Kay here to satiate her longing for Piper's Pub, and there's no better substitute to The Piper than the Harp & Fiddle.  Greeted by Samantha, our foxy, elfin, onyx-haired, raspy-voiced and practiced server as well as a gaggle of fellow metallions, we took in the rustic, eclectic decor as we perused the bill of fare and pondered the choices that laid before us.   Like PP, H&F offers British Isle-flavored fare such as Shepherd's Pie and Bangers 'n Mash, and not-so-Anglophile items as Asian Fish Tacos, burgers, and Bayou Shrimp, but being in such an establishment, we felt obligated to sample some the standards.   Shepherd's Pie (Samantha's favorite!) was ordered by Kay, and the B 'n M was shared by us as a starter, but for my entree, I threw the dart at something I'd never heard of before: Chicken Ballincollig.  Flaps of luscious chicken breast lounged on a bed of flavorful and weighty garlic mashed potatoes and were eclipsed by a softly, sweetly smoked tomato coulis that would make one helluva potent pizza or spaghetti sauce. Is it \"authentic?\" Should I be at all concerned? Smother it in cheese and put it atop some pasta, and you'd have Chicken Parmesan. Either someone has a creative mind, Ireland and Italy stole some riffs from each other, or two cooks simply had the same delectable idea.   One taste of Kay's Shepherd Pie, however, and I almost wished we'd just shared that. H&F's version differs in size from PP's (it's a little smaller), and includes shredded cheddar and onion crisps in addition to the usual ground meat (lamb?) and vegetables. Kay faltered 3/4 of the way through, so I stepped in to finish it, gladly taking in the gravy which resembled corned beef to my tastebuds, the rich tubers, and all else that makes this the king of casseroles.   Dessert for two was a humble Whiskey Bundt Cake that was as moist as a marsh yet only had a subtle booze essence to it that this non-drinker welcomed.   Harp & Fiddle is a worthy cousin and parallel to Piper's Pub in cuisine, atmosphere, and location. Slow down if you're speeding through Penn Avenue and give them a chance to charm you.   P.S. To address some of the negative reviews, I saw nothing dirty about the place nor was anyone remotely rude to us. We were here while the sun was still out too.",

Well, now that we live closer to the Harp and Fiddle, we decided to give it another try.  I have to say it was worth it.  It is completely different than our favorite place, but it is super good!   The menu here is definitely different, but there are some good old staples... Shepherds Pie, Fish and Chips, and some basic sandwiches, etc.  I got the Fish and Chips and I thought that they were pretty damn good.  Loved the fries, AKA Chips.  We had the mussels as an app to start, and I have to say, I thought that they were awesome.    It was not too busy, but it was steady for a 5pm dinner.  Lots of people imbibing some Guinness and other bevvies.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was definitely the most busy person working in the place.  I guess people needed some fuel after a busy day shopping in the Strip.  This is definitely more of an authentic Irish pub than those wanna be places like Claddagh or Fado (I know we do not have one here, but there was once one in Cleveland and there are still quite a few around).  They do not have an extensive whiskey or scotch list, so if that is what you are looking for, this may not be the best place (yet at least... seems like they are adding some new ones according to the bartender).  They have live music some nights too.  Definitely worth checking out!",

The fish was kind of slimey and didn't have a good taste. The fries were really hard and had been cooked until they was no potato within them. The Shephard pie had instant mashed potato taste some crumbled hamburger and plain cheddar cheese on top with small shreds of carrot. Not much better than a KFC bowl and the onion rings were just the frozen food variety. Not sure why people like it so much. If we had been drinking we wouldn't care. Maybe they had a bad day. I would recommend paying attention to cook times and to get rid of the fish. Maybe use fresh or in store made ingredients for Shephard's pie",

    "text": "I really really really love Harp & Fiddle.  Though I live in Denver now, I spent a fair amount of time in Pittsburgh and my office is right down the street.  Even if it weren't, I'd still spend time here.  Last week, while in Pittsburgh I ate lunch here two of the three days I was in town.  Seems that each time I visit, they've made some changes to their menu and their food is always consistently good.  On this visit, I had the salmon chopped salad one day and the chicken cordon bleu sandwich the other.  The salad was perfect for lunch - exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced as well.  A lot of times it's empty in here at lunch time (sometimes it's not) and I don't get it.  The lunch options toward the east end of the strip aren't many, so I'm surprised more people haven't caught on to lunch at the Harp.  Oh well, their loss is my gain.    In addition to being a regular lunch spot, this is also usually my choice for drinks after work as well.  My brother and I have spend many long nights at the bar and it's usually the first choice for work happy hours too.  Sad to say, that I used to spend SO much time here when I lived in PGH that when I walk in now, they remember my drink.  OOPS!  We've been here for Irish Dancing night, open mic night and karaoke night - they're all pretty amusing.  They also have a nice little pato out back for when the weather is warmer.  Whether they're busy or slow, the service is always spot on.  I really wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood in Denver.",

    "text": "All the way at the far end of the Strip we finally found the best bar in the neighborhood (admittedly out of only a handful that exist).  This place was charmingly well worn around the edges, but it's mostly a standard American-Irish pub, with all the familiar bric-a-brac and beer taps.  I have to object strenuously to a few of the drinks on the menu.  First, there is a \"Dark Bomb\"--Guinness and Jagermeister.  Then there is an \"Irish Pancake\"--Guinness and butterscotch schnapps.  And finally there is the \"Irish Hoe\"--half Guinness, half Hoegaarden.  These are crimes against nature.  I can't vouch for the last one, but the first two were terrible (of course I had to try them).  Jagermeister has no business within ten feet of Guinness, and the Pancake would have been okay if they halved the amount of butterscotch.    This month's featured beer is Red Stripe--get five bottles for $15.  The pints have some odd prices:  $5.61 for Guinness and Newcastle and $4.68 for Sam Adams.  They had some live music (a guy with a wee guitar singing eclectic covers) which was decent and ended at 1am.  We were the last patrons before closing at 2, and despite them sweeping and putting up chairs, nobody ever chased us out or even looked at us askance.",

To begin, we stopped in when it wasn't very busy...early afternoon..so we were surprised it was as dirty and unkept as it was. Sticky floors, bad smell, just general lack of housekeeping. The bartender was nice and cordial but that is the only positive thing I can say. The Sheppard's Pie was just aweful. Overly buttery with instant potatoes, too much cheap chedder cheese, the worst quality greasy ground hamburger and canned crunchy onions (on a Shepard's Pie?). I ate less than half and am debating if I will allow my dogs to eat the rest or throw it away.  The potato soup was so salty I chugged water afterwards to feel relief. I was physically Illl from the grease and butter. I mean that literally. The only thing Irish about this place is the name and the Guiness on tap. Other than an ill mannered and intoxicated uncultured college student no one will like this place. I have had better experiences at the Giant Eagle hot food counter. Sorry guys you have got to do better if you ever think ill return.",

I guess at one point you could say I was sort of a regular because my ex-husband is a musician who performed here a lot. I've  definitely missed what I would consider to be the closest thing Pittsburgh has to a real Irish pub. Stopped in yesterday (March 15th, the start of St. Pat's weekend) for dinner right after work. Arrived just after 5 pm and there was already a crowd but not packed yet. I imagine that probably changed around 7ish. I love that not much is different. Still serving great Irish pours and whiskeys, Friday live acoustic music and the food. Still pretty solid fare. We shared the shepherds pie which is one of my favorites because the seasonings are spot on and the mashed potatoes are light, fluffy and super tasty.  Prices are good and so is the service. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back. Now that it's back on my radar I'll frequent more often. Cheers.",

I can't comment on the taste of the food since we went on a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon in early September, for just drinks on the back patio. They do a nice Guinness pour of course, but also have a few local brews like East End Big Hop & Fat Heads IPA, along with the usual domestics & bottles. The back patio is great & since they're farther down in the Strip it's easier to park. Cork Factory garage is right down the street & priced decently (we paid $5 for 4 hours). The menu offers fish and chips, shepherds pie & then your standard burgers, salads etc. It is open for lunch but was not at all busy for lunch, I feel like it's still a primarily night time establishment. They also feature live music on certain nights. And our server was indeed Irish & quite pleasant and efficient. Worth a look see if you're in the hood & want a beer.",

I was here one time before when my partner played a music show so I was like, hmm for a baby shower? But I just went with it.   We got in and the lower part of the restaurant was where the babyshower was. So people could still walk through and go to the bar but we had the bottom basically to ourselves. Now I will say that since the restaurant part was right by the door everyone who was going to the bar had to walk through the party. Not a huge deal but kinda an inconvenience. A few times people were like is it open or can I come through. It just was slightly distracting.   But the space was open and fun. The kids at the party got to play on the stage. And they seemed to like that. It wasn't baby friendly so much but it's a bar so I didn't expect it to be.   The snacks we got to try were a meat, cheese, and veggie tray as well as chicken nuggets and meatballs. The food wasn't bad. I will say the chicken was pretty good and I ate my fair share. I wish there were more veggies, those went really fast. But that was more of an order problem than a representation of the place. The meatballs also weren't bad.   I don't know if I would say pick this place for a party like this, but it worked. And if you are ok with it then go with it.  The only question I have, do they have ADA compliant bathrooms? Because the bathrooms that we were told to use were in the basement down steep steps. That might be a point to also consider.  Other than that, I like it here for drinks and music but might think twice about a baby shower party here.",

They have THE Best pour of Guinness in Pittsburgh and they also offer the widest selections of rare Irish whiskeys. The bartenders and servers are beyond outstanding and the fellow drinkers are very friendly. It makes sense that they have been successful for over 25 years!",

    "text": "I have only eaten at Mulaney's once and drank here twice but I hope to come more often. I had a traditional Pittsburgh steak salad that was pretty good but the real draw is the music. The first time we came in, the place was very busy and an Irish band was playing on stage. By contrast, the second time we came, there was just a small group of gentlemen at a table with an accordion and a fiddle, singing traditional Irish songs. Both nights were memorable and we hope to get more and more of our friends to stop in with us. It's great to go from Bayardstown, down the street, to Harp and Fiddle. You get to keep the music going while enjoying different perspectives on the art. All around bad ass. I would suggest watching drink prices though. They are pretty high.",

    "text": "I've been to the Harp a handful of times over the years, but I've only eaten there twice. Once was quite a few years ago and the second time was this past weekend. The first time I went, I got fish & chips, and I was so unimpressed that it's the primary reason that I refused to eat there since. BUT this past weekend, my wife ordered the fish & chips and wow...awesome! I would definitely order them going forward. It's a huge piece of fish, though, so be prepared. I'm not sure what changed, but I'm glad it's improved.  I opted for the blackened tilapia sandwich, which was also really good...and larger than I expected. My only complaint was that it seemed like a lot of roll even for the entire filet being on there. The creole mustard/mayo was good, but I used it sparingly. The side of chips (fries) were good and had that typical hand-cut taste.  We also ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were really good. The Smithwick's broth was a different take on what we'd usually get our mussels steamed in and was delicious, and the mussels tasted fresh.  Overall, the vibe at the Harp is fun. Their large dining area has a dining hall feeling, which doesn't work for me when it's not busy and you sit down to eat, but it's good for their live music nights (which they have plenty of). I prefer sitting in the smaller bar area. The bartenders are always really nice and there's a nice neighborhood bar feeling when you're up there.  I'd say my only real semi-complaint is their limited whiskey options. If you're there for a Guinness, you're going to be happy, but if you want some whiskey, the limited list of Irish whiskeys may be underwhelming. We were told that they're working on making an actual list and adding to it, and there were some perfectly fine options, but you'll be disappointed if you want something even a little adventurous, like a Connemara or something.  Regardless, it's a nice, laid back option in the Strip, and if you're in the mood for some fish & chips you're really limited to two excellent options in town: Piper's Pub or the Harp & Fiddle.",

I have been several times to the Ceili  dances on Tuesday night, they are a lot of fun, and the regulars are great about reaching out to teach newcomers. There's lots of live music, and a truly Irish ambiance.",

    "text": "I've never not had a memorable time at Mullaneys. Whether it's the wonderfully fun atmosphere, great live music, traditional ambiance, friendly crowd or their annual Christmas karaoke, this place doesn't disappoint. It's one of the most authentic Irish pubs I've been to in Pittsburgh. I usually get the beer battered onion rings which I think is their only veggie food option and they're pretty good. Service is decent and the bartenders are always nice. If it's an Irish pub you're looking for, then look no further coz this is THE place. I was there for St. Patty's day this year and gosh it was a BLAST! And they have a weekly trivia night too!!  PS: The two stars I've docked them are for lack of veggie options on the menu (At least one more would have been nice) and the poor condition of their (ladies) restrooms. :( I always try to avoid using the facilities there if I can help it.. and who wants to limit their beverages in an Irish bar in order to not have to pee right?",
