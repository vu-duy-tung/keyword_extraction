I decided to go with the shrimp and pork wonton soup - which is actually soup as opposed to the other \"soup\" options which specify \"steamed\".  And also ordered the hot spicy wonton noodles under the \"dry noodles\" section of the menu.    On retrospect I should have ordered one or the other because it was wonton overload and generally food overload, I barely made a dent in either and had plenty to take home.  That being said, I enjoyed the soup and was able to eat about 2 of the wontons.  I was imagining a small bowl of soup but this could dish feed a family of 4 or more!  I wasn't in to the hot wonton noodle dish.  I got the wide flat noodles (as opposed to the thin rice noodles) so not sure if that made a huge difference because it was the flavor that didn't make me swoon.  You can definitely physically feel the heat of the dish but I didn't think there was much flavor.  I was sweating and my mouth was reacting to the spice but it was spicy hot as opposed to spicy flavorful.  Perhaps the name of the dish makes sense then.  I would be curious to go back and try something else.",

    "text": "Okay PGH, this place is legit!  A place where you can get 'la mien' and actually watch them make it?  I hope people in this city realize how privileged they are to have a place exhibiting such craft.  Came here with my colleagues on a Saturday night, after hearing about this place several weeks ago.  Food (9.0/10) = Ordered the following dishes:  1) Braised beef and tendon noodle soup ($11) = A bowl of harmony created by the right quantity and proportions of fresh noodles, meat, vegetables, and stock.  Noodles were damn good. Beef cooked nicely.  Texture and softness of the tendons done perfectly.  2) Marinated sliced beef shank ($8) = great cold appetizer of thinly sliced beef.  3) Pork and crab meat soup dumplings ($8) = I'm impressed! honestly, was not expecting much since I've had it from it's origin of Shanghai.  8 little dumplings with pork/crab meat, without the overwhelming quantity of soup inside.  A lot of places I've been in the US have thicker dumpling dough.  This restaurant's dumplings have thinner wrapping, which I prefer. 4) Taiwanese pork belly slider ($6) = not sure what made this Taiwanese, but what I am sure about is, this pork belly bun is DD - damn delicious.  Pork belly is soft, and cooked long enough so that the fat no longer had the off-putting chewy fat texture.  There is a lot of flavor in the meat.  There is coriander and a crunchy texture as well (ground peanuts?).  What really made this dish stand out was it's size.  I have never seen a pork belly bun this big.  It's slightly larger than the area of my fist (see picture).  I'm impressed. 5) Taro milk tea ($4.50 + $0.50 per additional topping) = this was pretty standard in flavor.  There are other flavors offered. You can add toppings like red beans, mung beans, lychee jelly, and grass jelly as well.  Service (8.0/10) = service was fast and not overwhelming.  Our waiter was nice.  One thing I noticed and thought was nice is how they asked customers if they have had the soup dumplings before.  Reason?  It can be tricky to properly eat these little treats.  Without care, you risk busting the dumplings and wasting all the soup inside.  Eat too early, and you can potentially burn your tongue, screwing up the rest of your dinner and your tongue's ability to send 'flavor' to your brain the next 24 hours.  Ambiance (8.5/10) = I give this a higher score than I usually do, for the ability to watch them make their noodles.  Have you ever tried doing this?  It's hard, and this is why I'm more impressed with finding this place in PGH.    Overall opinion = as I mentioned, this city is privileged to have a restaurant like this.  I only expected to see such places in California, NYC, Boston, or Philadelphia (i.e places with an incredibly high concentration of Chinese).  So why not slap 5 yelp stars on this review?  Well, I've only been here once, and would like to sample other items on their menu.  Second, the prices are slightly higher than what I'm used to paying in cities such as NYC or Philly (pork/crab soup dumplings ~$7-8, la mien noodles $6-8, milk tea ~$3).  Despite the pricing, I'm still going to visit this restaurant again for sure.",

Expertly prepared noodles, and the best soup dumplings I've had since Hong Kong.  Expect friendly service, an attractively remodeled modern asian atmosphere, and light, home made, flavorful, authentic, freshly prepared food.    Given all that, why isn't it a 5 that I want to go to \"Every day\"?  It has fairly limited menu options, and a few of the dishes are a bit timid.  Still all in all, a worthy contender against Squirrel Hill's many excellent asian eateries.  I can't get enough of their soups, noodles, and soup dumplings and I look forward to returning back again in the near future!",

The food reviewer for the Post-Gazette gave this place a 2 star review when it first opened and was promptly castigated by members of the city's Taiwanese community, so that should tell you something. And my parents' house is nearby so I can get delivery when I'm home!  The xiao long bao are fantastic. I've never eaten them in a larger city like NYC so I can't compare, but these are juicy with a skin that's just thick enough to hold in all the soup and pork. I like the dan dan noodles, which are peanutty and vinegary, and the minced pork noodles and spicy wonton noodles as well. Oh, and the scallion pancake. Get the scallion pancake. You won't be disappointed.  Everyday Noodles can get extremely crowded at lunchtime, especially on weekends when it's populated by students from Oakland. But it's well worth the wait, and it's fun to watch the chefs behind the glass wall wrap xiao long bao and pull noodles at the counter.",

Somehow, on this of all days, I had a breakthrough and instead of stumbling through my options trying to find the one perfect thing, my wife and I just started ordering stuff. Anything that caught our eye. And it worked.   We picked somewhat at random, partially based on descriptions, across different sections and ended up with a satisfying array of options. Plates and bowls of the Taiwanese style Dan Tsu Noodles, Vegetable Dumplings, Pork Wontons, Chicken Soup, and Steamed Broccoli were the end result.  The highlights of the day were the Pork Wontons with Mung Bean Noodles and the broth of the Dan Tsu Noodles. I wasn't a huge fan of the Vegetable Dumplings, but I think that was just my personal taste, as my wife did enjoy them.  The chicken in the soup wasn't super appetizing, but that may have been our only collective compliant. On the whole, it was a delicious and satisfying experience. There's not much that can beat a warm bowl of noodles on a cold winter day.   We will surely be back to explore more of the menu.",

    "text": "I was apprehensive about trying Everyday Noodles because the menu did not look vegetarian friendly and sometimes \"vegetarian\" still means it can contain fish sauce or shrimp paste/powder, plus I don't eat egg and figured the noodles were out....  So we called ahead and they told us there were vegetarian options without egg and without fish sauce etc. Looking at the menu, there are very few, almost none, of such options, just one noodle dish labelled vegetarian (cold sesame noodles) - and it was with egg noodles (the server kindly asked the kitchen for me). I was struggling. We were assured that the vegetable dumplings were vegan, so we started with those while further considering entree options. Just when I decided to simply get the dumplings and run, our super helpful server informed us that the Dan Dan noodle dish could be made vegan, less seafood products, and with rice noodles! So we stuck around.   The dumplings were absolutely adorable. And delicious! I'm pretty sure they are the best dumplings I've ever had. The filling consisted of shiitake mushrooms, some hearty green (kale?) and lil bits of tofu; very fresh and tasty.   We both also very much enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles (I got mine vegan, my partner got them \"normal\"). I thought the flavors of the dish were masterfully balanced, though I might ask for extra spicy next time. What was lacking in the dish was vegetables! Add some veggies to the dish, and I'd be giving a 5 star review.   My most pressing complaint is about the music. With fantastic food, excellent service and a pleasant enough space, they should re-consider their music selections because nobody should ever have to endure the likes of Reba McEntire and Celine Dion while enjoying soothing delights of the east. I'll take the generic Chinese music that you hear in every other Chinese restaurant over the worst songs of the 90s any day, though maybe not everyday.",

They were delicious and just brothy enough to be savory, but not enough to be too hot to eat or to make a mess of my shirt.   Next we tried the pork belly bun.  This was not to my liking.  My husband was a fan, but only towards the bottom of the bun where the sauce was.  Before that it was dry and pretty flavorless.  The dan dan noodles had much more sauce and liquid than I expected especially since it is listed under dry noodles.  It was alright, but not great.   The pork belly over rice greatly eclipsed the noddles.  The rice was savory and delicious from the pork belly and the addition of the pickled mustard greens.  The pork belly was nicely stewed and a nice unctuous counterpart to the rice.  I will definitely return and order more soup dumplings!",

Since I am a vegetarian, I asked if they could bring me the veggie version instead, which they did.  But when I got to the bottom of the dish, I found pieces of pork (apprently they just scraped off the pork and re-served it).  When I pointed this out, they offered to bring me a new order, but I asked to have it taken off my bill.  When I got home and checked the bill, they had not removed the broccoli.  Even though the food was quite good, I will personally never go back there because I am upset with their double dishonest behavior.",

Watching the noodle makers here stretching & slapping those noodles through the glass totally works for me!   We've eaten here twice now so we've sampled a few dishes: Pickled Cucumber, pork & crab soup dumplings, pork short rib noodle soup, pork buns, Dan Dan Szechwan Dry Noodles, Sesame Cold Noodles with Chicken, etc.  The soup dumplings are the biggest standout, but be advised to pop them open 1st or risk burning your mouth on scalding hot broth inside. They're well worth the wait to let them cool!   Everything I've had is good, although I do tend to agree with others that the portions are so large on the dry noodle and soup dishes that they can become a bit one note before you're finished. Still tasty & taking leftovers home isn't the worst idea.   It's fun and inexpensive to explore their menu. Service has been really helpful & attentive on both our visits. Great little place!",

They make their noodles from scratch, which is awesome, and they are totally affordable. I tried the dan dan noodles, which were under $8. Maybe it's just not a place for take out, or maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The noodles were very tasty and fresh on their own, but the dan dan sauce was really watery and the flavor was just off from other dan dan noodles I have had. I had to add some peanut butter to the sauce to thicken it up and give it some more flavor. Although I didn't have the best experience, I plan on giving it another try in the future. I plan on trying their pork soup buns, as they seem to be the greatest hit!",

I ordered noodle soup with shiitake mushrooms & bamboo shoots & the portions are HUGE. I didn't realize how much food I was getting whrn I ordered, but I was glad to have 2 meals worth of leftovers. The vegetable dumplings were DELICIOUS, but I think my favorite part was the tofu nuggets. They are little disks of silken tofu, lightly breaded and fried. The outside is nice and crispy & the inside is soft & juicy. Very indulgent. They only have chopsticks & soup spoons to eat with, no forks here, so maybe dont bring someone who has never used them before. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I wish they had more vegetarian options.",

And this place did not disappoint. I ordered the beef noodle soup, which had a great broth, quality pieces of beef, and chewy yet tender hand pulled noodles. I love, love, love the texture of the noodles. Even my friends who are from northern parts of China, who have had hand-pulled noodles from their native homeland, loved the noodles.  We also ordered the xiao long bao dumplings and mushroom + bamboo appetizer to share. Those were good, but not spectacular. The bamboo tasted like it was from a can, and had a weird sour taste to it.  Come here and order the noodles! I tried a bit of my friend's zha jiang mian, which was good as well. But my favorite is still the classic beef noodle soup. Would definitely come back here again if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again!",

You write your order down on a sheet using a pencil. Sort of like how a lot of sushi restaurants take your order. We got shumai, pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and some dessert to share. Soup dumplings weren't as good as the ones you'd find in NYC, but still pretty good. Scallion pancake was okay.. decent, but nothing to drool over in retrospect. Highlight of our meal was most definitely the shumai. I usually don't like shumai that much but these were delicious.  The ordering style sort of backfired later, because we decided to get dessert but since we didn't mark it on our sheet, we had to ask for another sheet and wait longer. We got the red bean sesame balls and a coconut jelly dessert. Both were meh. Probably wouldn't order again, but it was nice to try something new regardless.  The kitchen is open with glass so you can see the chefs working and the man pounding and stretching out the noodles was mesmerizing! I'd love to come back and try their noodles.",

I've tried both the pork and the pork/crab soup dumplings and I was very impressed. The flavor is perfect. I've also tried the vegetable dumplings but they weren't as good as the soup dumplings. I've also had the pickled cucumbers and while it sounds boring they are actually very good. It felt like a palette cleanser between all the noodles.   For my entrees I've had the dan dan noodles and the hot spicy wonton noodles. The dan dan noodles had a lot of flavor and sauce which I really liked. The hot spicy wonton noodles on the other hand lacked sauce so it felt very dry. If you don't like very spicy food I also would not recommend this dish. It was a little too spicy for my liking with all the red pepper flakes on it.   Now let's talk about the restaurant itself. It's a cute little restaurant with not much seating so you'll likely have a wait but it's worth it. You can watch them make noodles in the kitchen which is very cool and fun to watch. It's a nice place to go on a date because it's byob and they have a lot of tables for 2 people.",

Also try the Taiwanese Style Pork Belly Slider- its a giganto Steam bun with pork belly and cucumber and spices, Totes incred.  They make the noodles right on the spot so randomly you may hear the sound of fresh noodles being smashed on the kitchen counters!  Usually I park in the pay to park lot directly behind the restaurant- I've been playing this game called \"dont pay the meter \". Its a gamble whether or not ill have a $25 ticket waiting on my windshield after having dinner- but the taste of victory when theres NO ticket on the windshield is almost as good as the food itself! Everyday Noods is def one of my fave spots!",

This place gets busy for a reason- the food is great. I lived in the Bay in Nor Cal for a while and the Chinese/Taiwanese noodles dishes here are as good or better than anything I had in Cali. You even get to watch them make the dumplings and noodles! Shan Dong in Oakland cannot compete with this place!  They have boba tea in coffee, black tea, green tea, taro tea, coffee, and other flavors with all kinds of ad-ins like bubbles, jellies, etc. the black tea with boba is my favorite. So delicious especially when eating a spicy dish!   The wonton spicy noodles are phenomenal- the wontons are shrimp filled and every time I've had them they are delicious. Wide or thin noodles- they are all made in house and are just great!",

We think that they seated a few people ahead of us, too, but that's fine because the food and service afterwards were definitely 5 stars. Lots of options for vegans/vegetarians alike! Their menu has a neat little key. I ordered the only vegetarian option under Dry Noodles, which was Taiwanese Cold Noodles with cucumber on top. Absolutely delicious!! Such a great size, too. I left feeling full but not stuffed. We had gotten the food in under 4 minutes. Servers grabbed our card right away and refilled our waters often. Overall, will definitely come back again, whether that's eating in or doing take-out.   **$15 minimum if using card**",

My 2 year old was right in front of the window where they make hand-pulled noodles and homemade dumplings. The adults had a lot of fun watching too. The entertainment was great, but the food was even better. All of us loved the pork soup dumplings (XLB), the pan fried pork bun, and the green onion pancake. I also tasted the cold noodles - delicious - and the pork belly slider. The pork belly slider wasn't for me (too fatty), but my husband loved it.   Their hospitality really put our experience over the top. Shortly after our food arrived, my son started to get pretty fussy. Unprompted, our server brought over a small ball of noodle dough for my son to play with and pretend he was making noodles. It was a wonderfully kind gesture and I so appreciate their thoughtfulness. We will definitely be going back for the AMAZING food and warm hospitality.",

It was so unique and truly amazing that they somehow made a delicious and hot soup inside of a perfect dumpling. I would go back just for those! I ordered the pork shrimp wonton noodle soup and it was pretty good as well. I added some chili oil to mine for a bit more spice and it was great, although next time I would order what my girlfriend got, the braised beef noodle soup. That one was even better and had an excellent flavor profile!! The mango bubble tea is also incredible and I go in just for that sometimes. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",

I was surprised to only see 12 noodle options with many many other food dishes listed on the menu. There were way more options for soup noodles, but not feeling like soup, I went with the \"dry\" Dan Dan Noodles with shrimp.   I will preface this by saying, maybe it's just a certain preparation that I'm not used to, but the peanut sauce tasted vinegary to me. Am I crazy? Maybe. But I swear it had a specific taste I could not get past. I honestly couldn't decide if I liked it or I didn't. I came to that realization three days later after I had eaten the leftovers for that amount of time (yes, they give you THAT MUCH FOOD!).   As I said, maybe it's just in the preparation. But I'd like to come back and get some dim sum, or some bubble tea (very limited flavors) or maybe another noodle dish. A girl's gotta do her research, right?!",

You can watch the noodles being pulled by hand through a glass wall.  One mark of authenticity is everyone who works there speaks Chinese.  To my delight, they carry quite a few Taiwanese small dishes.    The BEEF NOODLE SOUP with thin noodles---so good!  The beef shank was oh so tender.  I think I ate the bowl dry.  The PORK SLIDER had a bit too much dough for my liking but it is probably the closest I'm going to come to my beloved gua bao of Taipei without having to fly overseas.  I've also had the SOUP DUMPLINGS and they are tasty but not the best thing on the menu for me.  The MILK TEA is pricey at almost 5 DOLLARS each but it is silky smooth and comes with a variety of toppings.  I'd even say it's better than Rose Tea's across the street!  The place is PACKED every time I've been there and that says a lot for only being open for a few weeks.  Everyday noodle really does leave me wanting to come back every day!  This place is the perfect addition to Squirrel Hill and a one-of-a-kind restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

The soup dumplings are as awesome as everyone says, and a pretty good value, especially for Pittsburgh. We also got the spicy wonton noodles, which we enjoyed. We're not big broth fans so we've avoided the \"wet\" noodle dishes, but the quality might get us to venture out of our comfort zone. Bubble tea was great again.  Tables are rather close together--I have a strong aversion to slurping/mouth noises and this did not serve me well--so it might not be ideal for a date, but we were still pleased with the consistent food quality.

The food was ready pretty promptly, and everyone agreed it was delicious. I had some soup dumplings, which had a great meaty taste. I only wish they served it with some ginger. I also really enjoyed the dan tsu soup noodles. The noodles were \"QQ,\" I appreciated the addition of bean sprouts, and the pork was very flavorful and had a nice balance of lean and fatty meat. The broth itself was lightly flavored. While other reviews refer to the broths' bland taste, I really enjoyed the lightness of the soup. It's also a pretty large portion and worth the price.  Definitely looking forward to returning!",

There were several groups ahead of us, so it was a 25 minute wait. We weren't pressed, so we waited. I ordered a bubble tea while waiting. Keep in mind they ask for cash or debit for these small purchases. You get boba and two other toppings included in the price.  We entertained ourselves by grabbing a menu and checking what we want. A good way to expedite the process. Also, note that it can get crowded and if it's a rainy night like when we went, the space can be tight.  We were seated and were set to go. Seaweed with garlic to share, dan dan noodles (thin) for hubs, wonton noodle soup (wide) for me. The seaweed with garlic comes and we love the flavor. The balance of sesame oil and garlic was perfect. Our noodles arrived halfway ino the seaweed. I let mine cool off and continue with a couple more bites of seaweed.   Now to the noodles. The wonton noodle soup was a huge disappointment. I'm a serious connoisseur of this of wonton noodle soup, it's a go to staple in my life. Here the broth was bland, very watery, the meat wasn't sitting in long enough for the stock to be flavorful. The noodles were too doughy. It wasn't well represented. The wontons did save it, which leads me to think stay with the dumplings.   The dan dan noodles were not authentic. A peanut flavor was added so the spice wasn't there. It definitely was not what we expected.  So, the saving graces where the seaweed with garlic and wontons. Those items might lure me back in, if in the area, but I won't go out of my way to return.",

The food is prepared in sight of the patrons: a testament both to their confidence in the food's composition and its freshness. Watching the noodles being made is also fun for any kids, too! The food is a well-prepared, unimposing, tasty Asian cuisine from the hot soup dumplings to the colder noodle salads. For lovers of noodles and all of their complements, Everyday Noodles is a necessity to visit in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Let me start my review by pointing out the obvious - this place is always insanely packed. Every as early as 11 on a Sunday, you may be waiting for a table. Sure sign that they do things right. All the noodles are made in-house as made evident by the busy cooks in the open kitchen concept. You have the option to choose thin or thick noodles. What really gets me through the doors, though, are the vegetable dumplings. Also made fresh in-house daily, I've only ever had the vegetable dumplings but wow are they absolutely incredible! Filled with finely chopped cabbage + other veggies with the perfect dough to filling ratio, these are made perfectly. Crazy, though, that they only have one vegetable noodle entree - and it's a cold season noodle dish topped with thinly sliced cucumber. The flavor is just okay. The only other veggie options include some starters like fried tofu, wood eared mushrooms, etc., or steamed vegetable options. Very few vegetarian/vegan options which is my main gripe. It's a little cramped in there and you're seriously on top of the table next to you. Service is always very quick, though.",

I said no not really ( I want to eat a hot bowl of soup sitting at a table not in my car or drive home and have it cold?) so I said I would like to dine in please  ok so there is a wait  no problem  wait time only 5 min  I get a bench table almost in front of the noodle makers  menu has soups all have meat except the mushroom version  fine thats what I order... they have a full bubble tea menu and I like that  the classic black milk  tea with tapioca bubbles service is prompt and friendly but my 9 dollar bowl of soup was just eh the mushrooms were a bit hard the noddles were just noodles for all that thwacking going on I thought they might be a bit more then just plain old noodles at 9 dollars for a bowl I can say eh it wasn't worth it (it was big but ...) the bubble tea was pleasant but the bubbles should have had a bit less hardness to them. so end of bowl ...not sure I would return  plus parking was hard to find",

It is a pretty small restaurant, with seating close together, so if you're not accustomed to sitting a little closer to strangers, or are looking for an intimate seating arrangement in which you can have quiet dinner talk, this would not be the place to take your date. BUT, if you ARE looking for amazing noodles and dumplings at decent prices, then this IS the place for you!  For appetizer, we got the rolled onion pancakes with sliced beef. I think it is a well put together, fresh dish. For main course, I ordered the spicy braised beef noodle soup. Just the perfect amount of spicy. The broth was rich and dark with deep undertones of the beef. The beef was so tender that it just pulled apart. The noodles were soft with just the right amount of texture and chew. We also got an order of pork soup dumplings. These things were little pockets of flavor in your mouth.   For dessert, we really wanted bubble tea. But because they had run out of boba, we got to pick one other filling from the list. I got taro milk tea with caramel pudding. My boyfriend got taro milk tea with mango pudding. They were both pretty good.   Will definitely make a return to Everyday, someday (;",

Tables and bench seating and a huge window to watch the guys make your noodles and dumplings--a la Eat N Park bakery style.  Biggest take away:  it smells weird in here. Couldn't figure out what exactly.  I had the cold sesame thin noodles and +1 got the vegetable dumplings.  My noodles were out instantly with a heavy peanut-y sauce, pulled chicken, and tons of cucumber.  The noodles themselves were incredible, but I thought it was taken over by how intense the peanut was.  Now I did love the sauce; sweet and creamy with a tiny spice, but way too much. +1 thought this was a selling point, but I'm gonna stick with Ramen across the street for this dish still.  The dumplings were incredible though.  I'm hearing that's why people go here.  The soup dumplings are supposedly infamously delicious but they don't have any Erin diet friendly ones so I can only speak for the streamed veggie.  The flavor was much richer than I expected or am used to, mushroom heavy and soft without the mushy veg-paste you sometimes get.  I'm pretty into these little guys.  I also had a mango milk bubble tea which I was seriously unimpressed with (and passed on to the lactose intolerant +1).  In general, I'm a fan.  There are few places like this around. I love the quality and the authenticity but wasn't all about it.   They deliver for free within five miles (which includes S'Liberty, woo) so I might have some dumplings in house soon but not sure if it'll be my first choice on Forbes.",

I also love their green milk tea (matcha), which is a bit thicker than regular milk teas. One downside is that it's cash only for orders under $15, but that has never stopped me from coming back!",

She did explain one item when asked but just seemed to be in a hurry.  Our food did come out fast but not all together.  One person was done when the last meal come out.  I get that most share and we did share some items but the last meal received was for someone that was not sharing.  We were given some take away containers before being asked and before being done...I guess we were at the table to long! Ha! With so many reviews and pictures will keep this short.  The potstickers and Soup Dumplings we had were very good.  We had the drucken chicken to start and it was a little to cold from sitting in a cold refrig. We were there on a Sunday when they are suppose to have Shrimp w. Loofah Soup Dumplings but it was not available...we were there for an early dinner so not sure if it was available that day or not.  We had some steamed broccoli with the minced pork sauce that was cooked perfectly and very good.  I am a fan of the food but the rush to get you out and the lack of any real service was strange!  So do take out!",

    "text": "First impression is that the restaurant is very cute. Definitely modern style but an obvious Asian inspiration with bamboo, wood, and dark tiles. The focal point when you enter is of course the window looking into the kitchen where you can see people hand drawing noodles and making dumplings. It's awesome to watch and there are two tables right in front you can have dinner and a show. All thought loud, it's pretty amazing their precision and strength.   PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS -- As the only place in Pittsburgh to get some xiao long bao, they're pretty decently price and good for the price. $9 a basket (8 to an order) is a pretty good price for having a monopoly on the market. They're filled with just enough soup and the broth is well flavored. I thought they were a bit skimp on the pork filling to be honest and the dumpling size is a smidge smaller than I would have preferred. When they come out they're nice and hot though and they provide boy the soy/vinegar sauce and ginger garnish for the dumplings. Best when hot, so don't leave them off for too long. All in all - I have had better, but I have definitely had worse. Would get again in Pittsburgh.   MARINATED BEEF SHANK --  Pretty good. Not sure what kind of sauce is drizzled over the lettuce garnish but it's a nice little something. The beef reminds me of the meat you get with pho and really sparks the craving for some. The meat was tender and they give you a pretty good helping for an $8 appetizer. Topped with green onions - it's a pretty good starter.   TOFU SKIN --  Generally not a fan of tofu skins and that didn't differ this time. There was a lot left to the imagination and a lack luster experience. I would not get this again. It's similar to eating jelly fish, no flavor. It could be better/improved with a spicy sauce of sorts in my opinion.   BRAISE BEEF NOODLE SOUP -- I didn't get it this time, but the first time I went to Everyday Noodle this is what I ordered. It was a very healthy portion for $11. The handmade noodles are really good. Being their main focus I would expect nothing less. They give a very good amount of meat per serving so I think the $11 price is justified. I thought the broccoli was a bit odd...there are much better choices for veggies in soups like baby bok choy or something. But good no less. I would recommend this dish. I've had the dan dan noodles and some others, but I would argue to say braised beef is my favorite.   I am pretty loyal to Rose Tea for my boba, but will admit Everyday Noodle has some delicious black milk tea. Their tapioca isn't as good, kind of hard, but that could be that they're older. I will admit that I like their variety in toppings like red bean, green bean, puddings, and jellies. I can't speak for their other flavors, but if you want boba then I suggest the black milk tea.",

Let me tell you, if you've never had soup dumplings you've never experienced what I believe is one of the few perfect bites of few food you could possibly have.   These dumplings are actually soup filled along with a pork or otherwise meaty meatball. They are amazing.   Now here's why this place gets five stars from me. Everything else I've had on their menu has been 100% solid and very repeatable (consistent).  Some of the top side dishes I've ever had anywhere are the drunken chicken (a cold sliced chicken terrine with goji berries and some type of wine maybe?).   Their fried silken tofu is also totally awesome. Crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside.   Their cucumber salad is ridiculously good, yet simple, and I applaud the use of a certain amino acid that may or may not have been added here.   I've had the shumai here also, which are high end, large, and very meaty.   I've also had the pork belly buns, they're larger than I've typically seen, and as always spectacular.   So, to recap, tons of awesome food that is good every time. Five stars. Hands down.",

The gyoza dumplings are the best I've ever had, plus the way they prepare them is interesting too.... they're all pan fried together then served flipped over on a plate still attached, resembling an omelet.

    "text": "Per my Taiwanese friends' recommendation, we took my mom, who is a \"dough-snub\" (see my review Szechuan Gourmet) to Everyday Noodles. We came on Saturday at 11:30am. There was no wait. Like good tourists, we took the seat right in front of the \"performance window\". My mom spent more time watching than eating, so the premium seating is totally worth it. ---------- We ordered:  - Beef tendon: My personal favorite out of all we ordered. So soft. So gelatinous. Beefy. On my next visit I MUST order this.  - Woodear mushroom & flat tofu: Has goji berries. Flavorful. This is my friends' fave.  - Seaweed: Also flavorful and soft. This dish is cooked thoroughly so it's very soft. Not much chewing is required.  - Pork belly slider: My dining buddy's fave. It reminds him of the Thai dish Kao Kar Moo (minus the buns).  - Milk tea: My dining buddy prefers the milk tea at the Taiwanese joint in Cleveland (Phusian Cafe). Has more tea aroma.  - Pork Soup dumplings: Awesome (for Ohio and PA). Must order.  - Pork & crab dumplings: My dining buddy's fave. Although my mom claimed she saw them took the dumplings out of the refrigerator - meaning this is not made fresh, as the Pork Soup dumplings are. Regardless, good flavor as well. ---------- My mom chatted with the owner for a good half an hour. He hired the head chef straight from Taiwan, who also made dumplings and noodles at a reputable Taiwanese restaurant.   On our Pittsburgh trip, we went to two restaurants owned by Taiwanese. Both places prioritize health over heavy-handed seasoning (meaning reduced sodium, sugar, fat, msg). From what I've heard from the Taiwanese joint in Cleveland, that's a total of three owners, all in favor of such philosophy. So maybe that's the trend in the Taiwanese culinary service industry. I approve. And I've never felt the flavors were sacrificed in any way.",

    "text": "My initial comments were based on delivery to my home. Since then, I have dined in the restaurant.  There is SO much that is good about this place. It starts with the homemade noodles; they have what Italian cooks call great \"tooth feel,\" meaning the homemade texture stands out and highlights the sauces.  For the Dry Noodle and soup dishes, you will have a choice of thin or wide noodles. I prefer the latter with sauces and thin noodles with soup.  A number of Dry Noodle dishes use an authentic Chinese sesame sauce, which is less creamy than mid-Eastern tahini sauces. Toss, give the sauce time to coat the noodles and you'll like it.   The soup dumplings are delicious; the veggie dumplings are good but a little bland.  Ask for shredded ginger and chili sauce to spice things ups.  From the Dim Sum menu, try the Pan Fried Onion Pancakes with Sliced Beef which are impossibly good. Many of the appetizers are palate refreshing, like the pickled cucumber and five spiced eggplant. There are four selections using rice. I have tried and liked Braised Beef over rice, which has a tasty gravy, infused with Chinese five-spices seasoning.   Finally, this restaurant offers real value to its customers.  Most dishes are under $10.00.  You easily get four dishes, which is enough to feed 3-4 people, for under $40.00.",

    "text": "I am a self-proclaimed foodie-- I love reading about food, cooking food-- and of course eating food. When I was planning our weekend trip to Pittsburgh, naturally food would be a big part of our experience.  We dined at some delicious spots over the 3 days in town-- but loved Everyday Noodle SO much that we ate two meals there!!  The soup dumplings do not disappoint! The first night I had the beef and dry noodle and my husband had the spicy wonton noodle. We both enjoyed our meal-- but he may have out-ordered me.  The second meal, I had the shrimp and pork wonton soup and he had the spicy wonton dry noodle again. This time we went with the wide noodle instead of the thin. We both thought the wide-noodle was better. My shrimp and pork wonton had potential, but it lacked flavor. My soup was a very watery-bland broth. It could have benefitted from some sodium and it would have been nice to have some fresh, whole shrimp in the soup as well.  We have both had better pulled noodles in other cities-- (comes down to the broth) but it was still a huge treat for us!   Bottomline: highly recommend!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so much more than I actually liked it.  Food: quality? Pretty darn fresh. My noodles were bland though! That was totally unexpected since this is a noodle store. I liked the texture very much and their house hot sauce but it definitely wasn't flavorful enough.  Service: no complaints but didn't wow me  Novelty: high! The chefs from Beijing make the noodles behind glass and it's fun to watch. However, it can also be jarring after a while to keep on hearing that loud thud when they slam the dough on the cutting board.  Price: way too high for a small noodle eatery. The scallion pancake appetizer was $7 EACH. You need at least 5 of them for a meal. It's highway robbery.   Portions: TINY. I have never been hungry after eating a bowl of noodles at a restaurant so I guess there's a first time for everything. I finished my tiny-ass bowl of bland noodles and went home for a second meal and dessert to feel satiated. C'mon, now.   I might recommend hipsters to go here but probably will not make the trip myself again.",

    "text": "The food  here is okay only because Pittsburgh lacks a lot of really good Chinese restaurants. Place is kind of expensive, especially since the cost of the ingredients they need to make the kind of food they make is pretty cheap. But I guess you can apply that to many of the Chinese restaurants here.  Jellyfish Salad - Probably one of my favorite things here. Like the garlicy taste but again really expensive. Don't think the small plate is worth $8.  Five spiced Eggplant - Also liked this one. Sauce is kind of ketchupy and vinegary.  Braised Beef Noodle Soup - Beef is really delicious, tender, and flavorful. Soup is kind of flavorless. Doesn't have the \"Beef Noodle Soup\" taste like ones in Taiwan. Had this twice. The first time the noodles were overcooked. Second time they were better and were more QQ.  Braised Minced Pork over Rice - Tastes like how I make it except has no ginger or shallot flavor, so pretty good.  Dandan noodles - This did not taste good. Was not spicy and tasted like peanut butter and vinegar??  Zha jiang mian - My favorite thing there. The sauce and meat are delicious.  I never had their Xiao Long Bao, but my sister said the frozen ones you buy at the Asian supermarket taste better.",

Four of us went and we sat at the long table in front of the window so we got to watch as they made soup dumplings and noodles.   The pork soup dumplings were amazing. Just the right amount of ginger to give it the extra flavor.    We also had the dan dan noodles, very much a peanut-style sauce, so if you're not a huge fan of peanut flavor, you might want to pass. (I loved it)   Next, we had the potstickers, pork, shrimp and crab shumai, and beef noodle soup. The soup had large pieces of beef, was very tender, and really flavorful. We had the rice with minced pork, pickled cucumbers and I had a green milk tea.  Highly recommend. Expect a 30 min wait, but well worth it!",

    "text": "Fresh noodles, Fresh Noodles, FRESH NOODLES!!  Then I saw how long the line was and thought \"OH this place is going to be good!\"  First being the soup dumplings! They really should have a diagram on how to eat these little morsels. I was presented with a bamboo steamer with dumplings, a side of ginger and vinegar, and a soup spoon. Okay? Luckily my friend who was with me showed me how to eat them. It was slightly embarrassing but enlightening. Google it if you are unsure how. The flavor is mellow yet delicious. The combination of ginger, vinegar, and soup gives this appetizer that great Umami taste!  Just don't wait too long to eat them or else they will dry out.  Braised Beef Soup Noodles: The soup was very good and flavorful. The beef has a lot of tendons in it (not my favorite type of beef) but overall good. You have the option of getting Rice or flour noodles (wide or thin).  I like the flour noodles best. The rice noodles are light and thin; breaks apart easily. The flour noodles are more dense. It all depends on your preference.  Oxtail Soup Noodles: I LOVE OXTAIL! Just sad that the oxtail they serve was small. But it sufficed my oxtail needs. You know it's cooked well when it falls off the bone. That's all I have to say about that!  Pork Belly Slider: Not my favorite. 1) Too large 2) Dry bun 3) dry pork It would be so much better and presentable if they made several small portions of the slider and served it that way. Or just make a bun instead. The steamed slider should be fluffy, like you are biting into a delicious cloud. Instead it had hard pieces like it was overly steamed. Lastly the pork wasn't that good, it was so dry.  Service/Space: The service is fast and friendly. No complaints. There are some communal seating by the noodle makers. The restaurant space is very tight yet clean. It reminds me that I am in the city and I like that.  Overall, I love this place. I'm definitely a fan! And can't wait to try more dishes!",

Bubble tea in my opinion is so no good. They put too much milk in it, bubbles are good, but also too sweet. If we ever go here we eat there and get bubble tea across the street @ Rose Tea Cafe.  I've had their beef noodle soup, which was good and their Dan Dan noodles (eh)  Interior design is nice, very modern. However, the seating space is rather small and there are usually long waits (depending on what time you go).  Good for college students or people going out with their friends",

We started with the shrimp, pork, and vegetable wontons which came with mung bean noodles. These were DELICIOUS!!! My boyfriend then got the dan dan noodles Szechuan style. These were great and filling. I got the braise minced pork over rice. This was great and the portion was very large for the price of only 7$!

However, it was a lovely day out, so we asked if we could sit outside. Turns out, you can sit outside if you get take-out AND there's no wait! I don't know why more people didn't want to sit outside. We got to experience a beautiful spring day, and it was way quieter outside than it was inside.   Anyways, the food was great! I am a huge fan of Taiwanese food. Having gone to Taiwan a couple of times because my extended family lives there, I thought the food we got was pretty authentic and delicious. I got the cold Taiwanese noodles. Since we got it to-go, it came with the noodles and cucumbers in one container, and the soy sauce, peanut-y sauce, and ginger each in their own containers. Everyone who tried my noodles loved them. My friends also got the braised beef noodle soup dish and one other noodle dish. Everyone raved about how good the food was. We also got some pork soup dumplings to share. They were ok (not the best I've had, but passing for soup dumplings). I definitely plan to come back!",

The staff is amazing, the kitchen is consistent, the prices are cheap for the quality, the service is always incredibly fast, and the food is to die for. I have been a weekly customer for years and upon leaving Pittsburgh, it will be the thing I miss most about my city.  My ideal feast for two is as follows: - taro bubble tea with double lychee jellies - cucumber appetizer to start (no. 2 fave) - pork soup dumplings (no. 1 fave) - pork & vegetable potstickers - steamed bokchoy with veg oyster sauce - egg yolks buns for dessert (Keep in mind this is a feast level of food for 2)  Some of my other favorite menu items: - five spice eggplant - steamed broccoli - steamed iceberg (surprising but so good!) - scallion pancake - pancake with sliced beef - dan dan noodles - both of the dry sesame noodle dishes - sesame rice balls  I'm not a big fan of broth soups in general, so they don't make my list of faves but honestly everything here is sooo delicious. I do not recommend this place for vegetarians just because I find the meat dishes to be out of this world but you can totally make it work for people with all dietary needs!  Thanks for all of the delicious meals, Everyday Noodles! I will miss you guys! I am drooling writing this review. I love love love Everyday Noodles with my whole heart and belly. Give them a chance and find a new fave!",

The vegetable steamed dumplings were fire  and so were the dan dan noodles (tip: use some chili oil to spice them up if you're into that). Their black milk tea is authentically brewed and definitely not powdered.   This place is really comparable to the notorious din tai fung (Taiwanese restaurant) minus the annoying lines. A jewel hidden inside Squirrel Hill.",

I started with the soup dumplings which were very good--freshly made-- and I will definitely take them again on my next visit. The Dan Dan noodles Szechuan style were very good and flavorful. However, personally I wouldn't mind this portion to be a little larger. My wife took the braised beef noodle soup, which was a much larger course than the Dan Dan noodles, with a very comforting touch. It's a good place but there is definitely room for improvement. However, for the price tag and the category that it belongs to, I would recommend this restaurant.",

Friends of mine we visiting town so my girlfriend and I took them here. We were seated immediately even though it was busy. We started with some bubble tea and that was wonderful! I got the mango bubble tea (that's what I always get when I get bubble tea) and it was the best I had in a while.   I ordered the Pork Soup Dumplings because the woman sitting next to us recommend that as an appetizer. They were the best dumplings I've ever eaten in my life. The flavors in side were so complex and delicious. They melted in my mouth. I have no idea how they got so many flavors into one tiny dumpling. They were so fresh and I could have eaten 20 more!   I ordered the Braised Beef Noodle Soup for dinner. We waited maybe 7 minutes and the food came out. It was steaming hot and fresh. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the broth was great! I couldn't finish all of my food because I was so full.   I will be going back soon for dinner! This is now my go to place to take people from out of town. I commend the staff because of how polite they were and they never missed a beat.   This place is a must visit if you're ever in the city looking for a delicious new food experience.",

Dan Dan noodles didn't contain one grain of pork, though not advertised as such, I generally get some pork love in my Dan Dan.  Noods arrived quite mushy, hence why I preferred the cold sesame. Potstickers arrive in a way that I had not seen before - cooked as a sheet and with a crisp bottom - fascinating idea, but it prevented us from cleanly separating the dumplings from the rest, so filling got torn out. Veggie dumplings were stuffed with mealy, pureed - turnip, maybe?  Felt like it would definitely be adored by the kiddos, but it ached for some seasoning.",

    "text": "Absolutely incredible noodle and dumpling restaurant located in the heart of Squirrel Hill. I don't know why it took me so long to write a review for one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Upon walking in, you'll probably jump a few times from the loud bangs from the chefs hand pulling and preparing the flour noodles. Luckily, you can watch them prepare everything so you know when to expect the loud noodle slaps. They do not take reservations and there is almost always a wait, but it's definitely worth it.  Onto the food, I believe you have 4 types of noodle choices when you order soups or noodle bowls: wide flour, thin flour, wide rice, thin rice. My favorite is definitely the wide flour noodles, they're as wide as fettucine pasta but the chew, springiness, and freshness of these wide flour noodles are incredible. Ordering-wise, the Hot and Spicy Wonton noodles optioned with wide flour noodles (obviously) is my go-to item. Nothing can beat the plump dumplings and the smokey spicy chili oil that blankets your nest of noodles. This is a dish i don't think I will ever get sick of. Also, don't forget the soup dumplings! It should be a crime to walk out of Everyday Noodles without ordering at least one round of soup dumplings with every visit. There's a little bit of a process to eat these, but everyone has their own technique. I prefer to poke a little hole on the side of the soup dumpling and sip the soup out. Then I bite the top of the soup dumpling and add a little drop or two of the soy sauce they give, along with a tiny spoonful of red chili oil, followed by a little bit of the fresh ginger laid on top. The flavors you'll experience in that single bite are unlike anything else. I like to finish off with a Mango Milk bubble tea optioned with the lychee jelly and bubbles, a great way to finish off a fantastic meal.   Everything I've had at Everyday Noodles has been absolutely spectacular, I have my favorites on the menu that are hard to stray from, but I can't wait to go back and try the noodle soups, especially on a cold day.",

However, don't let the wait discourage you - it is well worth it.  The aesthetic of the restaurant is almost industrial modern - there's a giant glass window that separates you from the kitchen, where you can watch the chefs make the soup dumplings while you wait for your food (this is seriously cool!)  The food itself is amazing. The pork soup dumplings are fantastic - perfect for sharing as an appetizer. They are definitely a must have. I've also tried the gyoza, which is also extremely good.   Now into the noodles. The noodle soups are some of the best I've ever had. Everything tastes fresh - and you can tell it is by watching the chefs hand pull the noodles from your seat. The broths are extremely rich and flavorful. I recommend getting the thin noodles with the chicken noodle soup - it is simply to die for, especially when it's cold and you want to warm up.  For those who can make it out - this place is a must.",

    "text": "Yesterday I decided to be the porker that I really am. I went and ran at the JCC and then met a friend for dinner. After trying to decide where we were going to go I remembered that this place is my go to, even if I sometimes forget to suggest it. I always remember at the last minute but it is never a bad thing. Honestly, this place is great. The food, the ambiance, the staff. Everyone and everything is just top notch.   We got there around 7PM and the staff greeted us warmly. We were taken to a little table in the back. I should have asked to sit near where they were making the noodles since it was my friends first time being there I would have liked him to be able to watch the noodle magic, but next time for sure.   We were in the back corner area but that did not distract from the experience. The waitress still came around and asked us how we were doing and was always there to answer questions. I had her go down the list of the dry noodles and boy, was she on it. Also, how do they refill your water glass so fast without you noticing it? It is mind blowing, or maybe I am just not that observant.   Now, as I get into how much food we actually consumed, just know, I did start this review by saying my inner porker did come out.   Appetizers: Golden Tofu Nuggets: These were really good. I will say that they are little medallions covered in some nice panko fried to perfection. The plate was full and we were able to enjoy them. The only thing, if they were smaller they would have been easier to consume and the tofu inside would have been fried a bit better. While it was good, I enjoy the littler sizes so that the tofu tastes less like tofu and more like fried goodness. These were good, but the portion size was a little larger.  Pork Soup Dumplings: These are amazing. Nothing is as good as these pork soup dumplings. While a little hard to eat at first they really are delicious. You just have to pop a little hole in the side, get a little of the soy sauce on them and boom. Amazing party in your mouth. The soup broth is flavorful and not at all salty and the little meatball, yummy!  Rolled Onion Pancakes with Sliced Beef: First-time trying, and it will not be the last. It was like a little beef burrito. It was super good. The fried pancake surrounded the beef mixing into the perfect little sized sandwich. This could have been eaten on its own. Seriously. It was filling and good. I will want to try the veggie version of this the next time I go.   Entree: Hot and Spicy Wonton Noodles: Yum. It comes with about four wontons, spicy noodles, and a little bit of broccoli. I think that for the next time I might ask for extra veggies to be added to the dish. The noodles were spicy, they were not lying, but it was not overwhelming. I would say that you can also add meat to the dish but this one did not really need meat since the wonton's were filled. Nummy Nummy in my tummy.   Ok, it was a great night and I cannot say how much fun I had coming here. The food was great and so was the company. I am happy that I got to show someone another noodle experience and they left raving and saying they are taking their friends here. I think that is a win in my book. Come here, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "The xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are decent tasting, moderately priced, but inconsistently shaped. Once, they were served at a temperature that was slightly too cool, and a few times they broke. The amount of soup is not too great either. It's not Din Tai Fung level but nonetheless it seems to be the best that you can get in Pittsburgh.  The beef noodles is okay but nothing too special. It comes with about 6 cubes of beef, two broccoli florets and one thin slice of daikon radish. The beef is tender and flavourful but does not quite reach the melt-in-your-mouth quality of better beef noodle places.  Generally the food is authentic and acceptable, and superior to the other Chinese restaurants in the area.",

The staff was knowledgeable and very courteous.      I let my friends order and we had more food than we could finish!   The thin noodles with beef were delicious.  We had it both dry and with brother.   Just enough flavor with being overly powerful!   Also ordered the soup dumplings, fried pot stickers, and pork belly slider.

    "text": "Everyday tastiness!  I've been to this country's finest Chinatowns...San Francisco, New York, etc...  And I have to honestly say that I was impressed with the service, decor and food at Everyday Noodles.    Let me first say that the service can often be brutal in a lot Chinese restaurants...noncommittal stares from wait staff, lack of patience when asking about dishes,  etc.. you know the drill.  However, my daughter Muff and I recently went to Everyday Noodles on a busy Saturday and while the line was lengthy, it moved pretty quickly thanks to the drill sergeant hostess up front.  Here's a further breakdown of the rest of the visit:  Decor - Truly appreciated the lack of faux Chinese decor.  Loved the lightness/airiness of the place.  Seating could be placed a little farther apart, but hey, it still beats 99% of the Chinese restaurants around.   Food -  Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Potstickers - Well done and you could actually taste each component, but nothing overpowered anything else. Yum!  Rolled Onion Pancake w/ Sliced Beef - Never seen this dish here in Pittsburgh, but I have had it elsewhere and this one stacks up pretty well.  Double yum!  Taiwanese Style Pork Belly Slider - Okay, braised pork belly with fragrant soy/ginger/garlic goodness?  Come on, man!  How can you go wrong!  Chinese Happy Family yum!   Dan Dan Noodles Szechuan Style - Wonderful chew to the noodles and we added a little extra stink to it by adding some garlic-chili sauce.  Great!  Overall, a great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene!  A round-the-world chopstick thumbs up!",

    "text": "Recently, a near-monsoon and the flooding that resulted from it had threatened to strand Kay and I in the East End one evening upon quitting time, giving us a perfect excuse to wait out the storms by sampling one of the shooting stars in Pittsburgh's culinary scene: Everyday Noodles.   Shimmering interiors, a lovely hostess, communal seating arrangements, and ringside-seat kitchen action immediately lifted the gloom from our weary, weeknight shoulders.   Our laid-back, long-locked server, one who reminded us of a musician friend of ours in appearance and comportment, took our orders via a pencil-and-paper order form system much like Burgatory does. Once our choices were circled and confirmed, the circus of taste, smell, and sight began.   Having researched the menu days before after a featured Yelp review arrested my interest, I knew I had to begin with something quite alien, new, and therefore immensely intriguing to me: The Taiwanese Pork Belly Slider.   The gelatinous bun that contained the uncannily unctuous, meaty, and flavorsome pork was quite simply not of this earth. Possessing the texture of marshmallow, a meringue, raw dough, and a hamburger roll all at once, it seemingly absorbed the taste of the hog in the same way a tofu would. The possibilities of what to place inside this futuristic bread are infinite. Chipped ham? Mozzarella? Mortadella? Nutella? Whaddya say, fella?  Next in line was an octet of something I've only seen Bourdain relish reverentially on television: Soup Dumplings of the pork and crab variety.   While not as large as those I've seen in the media, the pouches of painstakingly housemade dough that arrived to our table in a steam basket had me convulsing rhapsodically as Long Tall Tony has done whenever eating something favorable for your entertainment (envy? vicarious pleasures?). Eschewing the traditional method of biting a piece from the top and vampirically slurping the internal fluids out of each defenseless, quivering packet, I merely allowed them to cool, lifted them towards my mouth with the spoon provided, and consumed them with one bite, the broth flooding my palate with warm ambrosia as my teeth lacerated the exterior, the meats barely requiring manducation.  Served at precisely the same time was my Oxtail Noodle Soup Consomme, complete with an ornate, occult-looking wooden ladle. My father has long sworn never to eat oxtail again in his days for reasons that remain unclear. For that reason, oxtail has been one of those animal parts that has always held a forbidden mystique to me. Just what does it taste like? Why does dad revile it?  As every stock-soaked beef morsel fell from their shamrock-shaped bones and withered into sweet nothingness onto my tongue, I thought amiably only of one thing: Corned Beef. Oh what a Beef on Weck or French Dip one could make with oxtail. In this context, however, I had to settle for having my oxtail chased down with a sea of dark and darkly savory Oriental bouillon in which tender, lovingly scratch-prepared noodles bobbed and drifted.  Dessert was a doublet of delight. The Crispy Creamy Mini Buns were just that. Ideal in their glazed glory, they immediately brought to mind donuts, particularly those from a wildly popular chain that expanded too quickly for its own good. The Sweet Egg Yolk Steamed Buns, though, were where horizons were expanded. Built from the same, surreal substance as the buns involved in the aforementioned pork belly sliders, the three orbs with canary irises were filled with a neon yellow custard that was an exercise in saline vs. saccharine alchemy. One bite had me dreaming of eggs on Sunday morning. Another would take me to dessert that same evening.   Everyday Noodles is somewhat of a misnomer in that this isn't \"everyday\" Chinese. Rather, what's being served up here is exactly the manner of Chinese cuisine I'd been craving for all too many moons; the dishes I'd never heard of before and never knew existed. While I'll continue to enjoy General Tso's Chicken and Crab Rangoon as much as my fellow countrymen, Everyday Noodles has certainly broadened the local landscape of Asian fare by simply elevating and introducing to Pittsburgh palates those (well-executed) dishes that were formerly obscure to us. For that I thank its staff and ownership.   P.S. Speaking of ownership, the restaurant's co-founder Mike Chen came to our table to chat briefly with us as we dined. Until he told me, I had no idea that Mr. Chen also owns Tamari. Ironically, while EN's pork belly was superb, Tamari's wasn't quite as good (read: dry. look up my review. it was one of only two gaffes).   P.P.S. All of our dishes were affordable, easily shareable, and conducive to varying levels of hunger. Be it a quick bite or a grand feast you're searching for, EN has a meal for you.   P.P.P.S. The service and atmosphere were both stellar all around. Break out of the box of Americanized Chinese food and make time for Everyday Noodles.",

Squirrel Hill for me is a neighborhood seldom visited but when I do make the 40 minute bus trek I always find a hidden gem or new development.   My two gripes and I will try to keep them  short, my boyfriend's Taiwanese style pork belly slider and our beef and green onion pancakes were COLD burrr, chilly not warm at all and the waiter was a tad to brisk with his intro , snatching the menu away from us before we were fully done examining it.

My favorite is the wonton one, and it's so spicy that I can't usually eat the whole thing (and I am a hot sauce fan, so I usually persevere in such situations). The decor is very cute and I love watching them make noodles and dumplings. I like to go in spring/fall because it's often overly warm in winter and I can't do hot soupy things in summer.",

Was so crowded when we came and thought we gonna have to wait awhile but nope, about few mins later they seated us right away!   Literally ordered 8 different dishes (no lie!) and finished most of them and just took home some of the leftover shumai. Our server was such a nice guy and he even asked us twice if we're sure about those 8 dishes because thats a lot of food    I enjoyed my time there -- the atmosphere is nice and different. If you're from like CA or something like that dont compare too much. For us here in the burgh its a different style yet reasonable dimsum place. Def gonna come back soon!",

The xiao long bao were delicious but my favorite was the Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Wontons with Mung Bean Noodles, Schezuan Style. The sweet egg yolk steamed bun was also delicious.",

    "text": "When I came back to the burgh, many of my friends said good things about this new noodle shop in town. I kept hearing things like cheap, authentic, flavorful, and amazing bubble tea. Well, let met just say that the bubble tea is most definitely the best in the city! Delicious, customizable, and a good value for the size. I loved their taro tea even though I'm usually not a fan.   One person disagreed about the food, though, and I didn't believe her so I dragged her here to show her that she must've just caught them on a bad day. Afterwards I have to agree with her opinion that this place was a bit underwhelming. The concept is great - casual, simple and authentic Chinese food done well/small menu, gallery to see fresh noodles being cooked by experts from Asia. And hand drawn noodles! What's not to love? Unfortunately the execution fell short.   Beef noodle soup - If they are trying for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, they completely missed the mark on the spicy, acidic, tomatoy, intense broth. If that's what you expect, you will be utterly disappointed. But as it stands on its own, the flavor could still be more developed. I did love that they gave generous portions of beef (flavorful and tender) and noodles. But the texture of the noodles was rigid and not chewy at all :( Disappointing. I love hand drawn noodles, but I guess I'd have to keep going to Philly to get my fix :( and at 1/2 the price, too.   Pork over rice - Pretty good. This one is definitely a Taiwanese staple, but tastes a bit different than several of the variations I've tried before. They use much leaner meat which would be ggood for the self conscious but sacrifices a bit in the flavor department. One spice was overpowering, but I didn't try enough of my friend's to remember what it is. Overall, much better than the noodle soup.  Seaweed - Best dish we had. Great texture, well dressed, and super refreshing. A decent portioned appetizer for $6  Spicy szechuan noodles - worst  dish we had. Expensive, completely underseasoned sauce and underwhelming wontons. We had to ask for salt because it was just inedible. They now come with mung bean noodles.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed. I wouldn't be against coming here at others' suggestion, but it's nothing worth mentioning :/",

    "text": "I traveled to China a few years ago and discovered soup dumplings.  It was difficult finding good American food while there, so the dumpling find was a life saver.  Anyway, I was searching for something in Pittsburgh and found Everyday Noodles.  The kids and I showed up about 15 minutes after they opened and the wait was already 25 minutes.  Once seated we ordered some fried potstickers. They looked a little strange but tasted excellent.  Next was the soup dumplings. We ordered a variety to sample. I would say they were just ok.  I guess a dumpling can only be so good, but compared to the real deal in China, they were just ok.  We finished with an order of red bean paste for dessert.  That was good. Not real sweet, like sugar, but good.",

It really hits the spot when you're craving some noodle soup. The price is decent/reasonable for the demand.   The space is a little tight because they utilize as much of the space of possible. I love being able to see fresh noodles being made through a glass separation. This restaurant does get busy so the wait can be long. And because the wait usually is long, when you're finally seated it feels as if the staff is constantly rushing you.",

Not only are the noodles fantastic, the soup dumplings here are phenomenal. Delivery services are also very quick!   If it's your first time here, I would highly recommend the soup dumplings. If you like spicy food, I would recommend the dan dan noodles and the hot spicy wonton noodles. The pork & vegetable potstickers are pretty good, except they are a bit greasy so keep that in mind. If you are in the mood for some noodle soup, I would recommend the braised beef (and tendon) noodle soup. While it is a bit more expensive than the dry noodles (like the dan dan noodles and the hot spicy wonton noodles), there are quite a lot of beef pieces, so it is definitely worth it.",

Also decided to get the milk tea from here, even though I'm usually strongly against bubble tea from restaurants because it's usually horrible.  This place proved me wrong.  So, so wrong.  I think the milk tea was the creamiest/thickest milk tea I've had + the balls were perfection.  The best milk tea I had during my Pittsburgh trip.  You can also sit in front of the window where they make the dumplings and noodles.  Best.view.ever.",

You fill out your food order on the form at the table. They take the form and deliver your food to you.

    "text": "Everyday Noodles has a stellar menu of noodle goodness. They make their flour noodles in the restaurant which is a great authentic touch. The pork soup dumplings are out of this world and I highly recommend them. Little dough pouches filled with savory broth and pork. It's best eating them with the provided spoon. Poke a little hole in the dumpling to allow some broth to spill into the spoon and slurp it up! I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was a HUGE portion! Tender chunks of beef, a deep and flavorful broth, a chunk of bok choy and plenty of noodles. I had plenty leftover for lunch the next day. I also tried the Dan Da noodles which were spicy and peanuty and an equally large serving size. The cold sesame noodles were refreshing, light and also had a peanuty flavor. They also made for easy leftover since they didn't require any reheating. If you love noodles, you'll LOVE Everyday Noodles!",

The dumplings were very good - especially with chili paste (you'll have to ask for this on the side). The braised beef dish was also very good - the texture of the meat was perfect, the flavors - complex. There is one major flaw with the meat dish and that is that there was a substantial amount of fat. About one-fourth of the beef was  fat. Seemed wasteful as we didn't eat it and I wasn't too happy about the owner's cutting corners that way. But - I did really enjoy my meal at Everyday Noodles, and if you order veggie - there's no going wrong.",

There were 3 of us and we had oxtail soup, pork noodles, Dan Dan noodles, eggplant, bok choy, veggie dumplings, beef and scallion roll and bubble tea. I don't even know how to pick a favorite! The place is cute as can be and it's as much fun to watch them make the food as it is to eat it. The place is busy now so there was a wait to be seated but the food was served very quickly once seated and the service was good. On a street with so many good restaurants this place will do very well.",

After we finished our entrees, the manager came to our table and told us that we needed to leave so that she could use our table for other waiting customers. He thing is, it was a cold night in Pittsburgh and there were no other large parties waiting and there were several other tables available in the restaurant. We were so shocked that we were told to leave that we quickly got our things together and proceeded to head to the door. On the way out I told the manager that I have never, ever been told to leave a restaurant to make space for another customer who was waiting, and that I thought that this was extremely rude. I will never go back there because of the manager's behavior. Restaurant patrons should not be treated this way.  Go to another noodle restaurant. This one isn't worth it.",

    "text": "This is a nice restaurant in terms of Taiwanese standard. I have come to this restaurant three times. In the first two times (in early March), I found their supposedly best seller, soup dumplings, very disappointing.   The third time I came I decided to give soup dumplings another chance. Surprisingly, this time was totally different! I saw the owner and told him that the soup dumplings got a big improvement. He told me that many customers have complained to him that the soup dumplings were disappointing. Therefore, he decided to hire the master of the previous young chef who was in charge of making soup dumplings. And it turned out to be a right decision.  For me, the basic required features of soup dumplings are two: 1) the dumplings must have a good amount of soup inside; 2) the soup has to be very, very hot. There are of course other important criteria for judging the tastiness of soup dumplings. Believe or not, the soup dumplings that I ate in the first two times never passed the low par of the basic criteria. They totally looked like a joke. But now they seem getting better.   The reviews saying that their food is too bland is partly True but also a bit unfair. When people ask me what is the difference between Chinese food and Taiwanese food, one thing that I usually say is that Taiwanese food tastes not too heavy because of the influence from Japan. Most Taiwanese do not add soybean sauce in a bowl of steamed rice like some Americans would do. Most Taiwanese do no add too much hot sauce in the noodle soup like some Chinese would do. So, if you ONLY accept heavy taste food, this is not a place that will please you. But again, I think that their food is pretty authentic Taiwanese food.  My top five favorite dishes are: 1) soup dumplings; 2) rolled onion pancakes w. sliced beef, 3) pan fried green onion pancake; 4) (thin) noodles with minced pork sauce; and 5) braised pork belly over rice.",

Comforting and tasty noodle soups, dry noodles and most specially, SOUP DUMPLINGS.  I haven't had soup dumplings in Pittsburgh, ever.  I'm pretty sure they don't exist anywhere but at Everday.  And they are perfect.  Perfect thickness in the noodle wrapper, delicious pork & crab meatball with just right amount of broth all in an about 2 inch bundle of soup dumpling perfection.  The pickled mustard greens and pork soup was nice, but I think needed a little more flavor, although there were sauces to pour, so I'll try that next time.  The pickled cucumbers and braised tofu smothered in tantalizing orange sauce were each perfect little beats to get our appetites going.  We  went on opening day, and the service was great, it was crazy busy but the wait time was efficiently managed by an incredibly peppy staff, who all seemed to also be helping each other out with refilling waters and checking on tables. Annnnnd, it's BYOB, and we all know how much I love that.",

Clean bright and open California style kitchen where you can watch and hear the staff twist and smack the hell out of noodles.  I loved several dishes including a noodle dish with fresh minced pork and the pork slider on a long steamed bun but the dumplings where just OK and the ox tail soup and hot and sour soup was ho hum.  I do recommend this place but am not as in love as I wish I was.  Warning the eggplant though not bad was a surprise as it is served cold.  The place is clean which gets it points but with all the hoopla and the sight of fresh noodles being made and steaming baskets of dumplings I expected more.  I did like the Jasmine tea and the Sweet Bean Paste rolls for a finish.  Enjoy. FYI it is the first of a chain concept that is operating all over Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.  We are lucky to have the first Everyday Noodle in the West open right here in Pittsburgh.  This is a venture by the owner of China Palace.",

    "text": "Timing is key in order to enjoy your experience at this place, I cannot stress this enough. During very busy hours, not only will there be a wait to sit down, but also servers will not be able to reach you or help you out.   The reason I am docking a star is due to the lack of options without pork. All soup broths contain pork as well. Substitutions are unfortunately extremely limited, however, this is due to the fact that they want to keep service as quick as possible.   And by quick, I really mean quick! Food arrives within 10 minutes in waves. Typically your noodle dishes will come out first, following that would be dumplings, then any appetizers or sides, and finally, dessert.  As for price, I would definitely say there are two routes that can happen in visiting here. You can either fill up on a noodle soup for $12, or spend $30+ on small dishes. In other words, this restaurant is as expensive as you make it to be.   Service was good on the times that we came in on non crowded occasions, however, when crowded, it was a bit intimidating.   So far we have gotten:  -crispy tofu nuggets- crispy outside with pudding-like inside, oyster sauce brings out the contrast, get it for sure -vegetable dumplings- not the best Ive had, but still worth trying! Tastes like common gyoza, but has larger amount of filling and a hint of fresh ginger.  -dan dan noodles -hot spicy wonton noodles without wontons- noodles are very good quality, spice tastes a bit flat, but is still bold and hearty -scallion pancake- these are pretty small, but have a crispy outside and pillow inside.  -sesame red bean pancake- crispy, served hot and definitely unique. Would highly recommend! -sesame balls- very well made, on the smaller scale but very inexpensive and delightful. Would highly recommend -steamed egg yolk buns- a bit too dry and could use more filling, but is doughy in texture and has a sugar cookie taste to the filling, which is solid.  -crispy creamy mini buns- kind of like doughnut holes, nothing too special",

The beef noodle soup is more like noodle beef soup--they give you more beef than noodles...the noodle soup is kind of sweet, not for me... The Taiwanese Gua Bun is pretty good, but a little pricy.",

I had the beef and tendon soup last time I was there, and it was so rich and luxurious. The handmade noodles can't be beat. All of that chewy, umami goodness...After half of that bowl of soup, I just wanted to curl up under a warm blanket and take a nap! And you absolutely have to try the pork soup dumplings and the vegetable dumplings!  I go back to Everyday Noodles every chance that I get! I wish I was up that way more often.",

    "text": "First and foremost, no one mentioned previously that this place is super loud. It's small and has one of those modern restaurant feels, so the acoustics are horrific. Plus, there is the added benefit of hearing the noodle makers bang the large ropes of dough onto the counter repeatedly while you're trying to have a conversation in an otherwise extremely echo-y place. Seriously...I can't believe no on mentioned this.   Be prepared to get RILL cozy with your neighbors. Actually, you may as well just call them table mates, given how close in proximity we were sitting.   I'm also not a big fan of being able to see into the kitchen and know exactly how they're handling my food. Luckily my back was to the whole open glassed-in open kitchen thing, but if you're into watching people make your food, then this is a great spot.   Okay, rant over.   Onto the positives:  Extremely pleasant hostess and waitress. They were very very very helpful answering all of my questions, and very patient with me when I took forever to decide.   The milk bubble tea stuff I had was good. I believe I had the mango milk tea, and it was sweet without being too overbearing. I'm not a ginormous bubble tea fan, but this one was certainly better than others I've had.   I heart dumplings, and the soup ones here were divine. So good, so yum-tastic, and enough to share. My only qualm is that the table we were at was so ridiculously small for how big the container of dumplings was, but as soon as I tried them I quickly stopped giving a damn about lack of table space.   I also tried the pork belly slider and it was OVERLFLOWING WITH DELICIOUS MEATY PORK BELLY NOMS. Between this and the dumplings I was pretty full, but I was also hell bent on trying their noodles.   I hurriedly made a stupid decision and got some sort of vinegar based noodle dish. It was prepared well, but I hated it because I hate the strong taste of vinegar w/ peanut sauce. My fault for ordering it, but I'm confident that I'd go back and choose something less sucky for my taste buds.",

First, the Bubble Tea is by far the best I have ever had; I ordered the black milk tea with red bean topping and it was decadent.  Now onto the food selections; we ordered several plates for sharing amongst three people.  *Pork Belly Slider- YUM YUM YUM!  This was more like a full size sandwich on a delicious and soft homemade pancake.  The pork belly was prepared perfectly and had just the right amount of fat to add flavor yet not be greasy.    *Dan-Dan noodles- We ordered the wide flour noodles.  The broth was spicy with a touch of sweetness and topped with peanut paste.  *Pork Soup Dumplings- Large portion and perfect taste!  *Sweet Egg Yolk Steamed Bun-  This was a really good \"dessert\"!  The buns are  so soft and fresh, but with a duck yolk right in the middle.  The yolk is prepared with honey and vegetable (think of a custard consistency).  I suggest trying Everyday Noodles if you're looking for a perfect balance between authentic and Americanized Chinese/Taiwanese food.  Go ahead, step away from the general tsos.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about this place from many of my coworkers. They all recommend it but I think if you have had soup dumplings in NYC or California, you might be a little disappointed. But for Pittsburgh, this place is really good. They make fresh noodles on site.   I came in and the atmosphere was nice. It's a small restaurant in Squirrel Hill in the busy shopping and food area. The menu was different. You check off what you want and give it to the waitress. I checked off crab and pork soup dumplings, beef and green onion pancake, and a milk green tea with coconut lychee.   First came the beef pancake roll. I really was not a fan. It looks very good and I usually do like scallion pancakes. It was very pretty and I'm sure others will like them a lot.   Then the soup dumplings came as they normally do in a bamboo steamer. I was a little disappointed that a few of the dumplings had their soup seep out before I even opened the steamer. They provide tongs for those who are unable to pick up the dumplings without popping them with chopsticks. I just used my chopsticks and picked them up into my soup spoon and ate them with a little bit of vinegar. They were a little on the bland side but still pretty yummy.   The best part was the bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually milk tea. Other places in Pittsburgh offer bubble tea but they don't actually have tea. The lychee flavor matched perfectly with the tea. The bubbles, however, were mushy with little flavor. I prefer when they are a little bit sweet and cooked firm but not raw and crunchy in the middle.   Pittsburgh is sadly lacking in good Asian cuisine so this place is pretty amazing in that sense.",

(see other comment from guest who said they \"jumped\" a few times due to the intensity of the noise made from the pounding/slapping of the dough against the counter). My dinner companion  asked a host or waiter if there was any way to lessen the intensity of the noise, and the host/waiter laughed and said no.   .",

He said they had been voted best noodles in pittsburgh so I wasn't going to turn it down. It lived up to its short reputation with me! I'm not sure if this is considered Korean, Vietnamese, or what type of food but it was amazing! Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Our food came out very fast. We got the servers recommendations - the pork soup dumplings (the soup is IN the dumpling!), he got the Dan Dan noodles Szechuan style and I got the Dan tsun noodles. They all were amazing. His was spicy as mine was not, but we enjoyed both. The only complaints I would have (very minor) was - when we ordered the waiter said \"that's not much\" and continued to push an appetizer. I was not upset because the dumplings were so amazing but it ended up being A LOT of food for the two of us. We could've split a bowl. The second would be they only set the table with chop sticks and not silverware but I actually enjoyed that, it was just frustrating at points. The noodles ARE HOMEMADE. You can actually watch them make the noodles there, which is pretty neat. One thing I wish I knew ahead of time but will definitely utilize in the future is the fact that it's BYOB! Who doesn't love that?! I really enjoyed the overall atmosphere, service, and loved the food. I give them 5 stars and would highly recommend. It's definitely out of the box, even from the most popular chinese food. Love it & will definitely return!",

    "text": "I thought were back in Beijing . . .  Ginnie and I have something of a  tradition on Christmas Eve , , , a movie and dining out . . . usually Asian. This year it was the Manor in Squirrel Hill to see Philomena . . . Judy Dench still at the top of her game, and Everyday Noodles afterwards. They have been since March, but it has taken us a while to get there. Not sure why we waited so long.  The place is a perfect translation of a contemporary noodle shop in Beijing (with some Taiwanese bubble-tea tossed in on the side) to Pittsburgh. Clean, sharp design, open kitchen, fragrant clouds wafting out from the stacked up steamers. It was a very cold night, and we wanted warm and savory. On the menu, Item #42 was Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. This sounded like one of my favorite Beijing home preparations, Zha jiang mian. I asked our waitress whether this was the dish I was looking for, and, despite my awful pronunciation, she confirmed that it was. It came in minutes and we dug in with gusto. Deep, savory, slightly sweet, a firm foundation based on bean sauce, braised pork and just enough fish stock to deepen the flavor. Slivered cucumbers to balance, and, a surprise, a sprinkling of edamame--a great touch. All over broad wheat noodles. A great start, along with green tea courtesy of Forte. This was a fine beginning, and we decided to finish things off with a scallion pancake, or as the menu describes it #34, Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake. Wow!!; the best I've had since Jinan in Shandong Province, just down the Yellow River from Beijing. Crispy and flaky on the outside, pillowy soft inside, sweet and pungent scallions, piping hot . . . a 10 of 10. So, if you want the best of straight-on Beijing cooking, and don't have 24 hours for a flight to the East, head to Squirrel Hill and Everyday Noodles!",

The pot stickers were good as well, but nothing beats those soup dumplings.  It's also a cool environment and the staff is super friendly.",

We Have been there couple of times, three times we were served with the same waiter, I didn't ask his name. Two of these three times this guy forgot to place part of our orders and let us wait for nothing until I asked him where is my dish. I had been waiting for an hour and got to leave, so asked him to cancel that dish. This guy almost yelled at me: I just placed it for you! The manager was pretty nice and apologized to us, but this guy didn't say anything till the end.  If they still hire this kind of waiters, we will never come back. Their serving doesn't match the high quality of the food, what a shame.",

We heard this place has the best soup dumplings in Pittsburgh so decided to check it out.  Soup dumplings 5/5. They had great flavor and were made fresh right in front of our eyes at their open kitchen window. They were not quite as large as other restaurants I had tried soup dumplings though. Would definitely order them again.   Braised Beef noodle soup 3/5. The braised beef portion was generous and cooked to perfection. The soup on the other hand didn't have much flavor and tasted pretty bland which was disappointing and why I'm giving the soup 3 stars.  Dan Dan noodles Szechuan style 3/5. These were just OK. I also felt they lacked flavor and the portion was on the small side.   Overall, I would come again but would probably try other restaurants before coming back. If I'm really craving soup dumplings, then I would come again for the dumplings.   In a previous visit I had their boba and thought the boba balls were a bit hard which is why we didn't order them again.",

I let the hubby decide where to take me for my birthday and he chose Everyday Noodles. While he has been here multiple times, this was a first for me. Let me tell you, I was definitely not disappointed!   I tend to let my eyes get bigger than my belly, but that was ok in this situation!   We got there hoping it wouldn't be so busy because of the Steeler game, but still ended up with a 20 min wait. Which gave me time to look over the menu and decide what we were going to try.   We decided to try the Pork Soup Dumplings, Braised Beef Noodle Soup, Hot Spicy Wonton Noodles and the Pan Fried Pork Bun.  The Soup Dumplings literally rocked my world. I ate it the American way by just putting it on my soup spoon and sliding it in my mouth. But biting into it is inviting a party into your mouth! The burst of flavors will literally make your mouth so happy. The soup has a great taste as does the little meatball. The whole thing just comes together!  The Braised Beef Noodle Soup was really good as well. It was supposed to be spicy but wasn't spicy enough for me so i got some chili to add to it. still wasn't as spicy as I like but it was still good none the less. It was full of noodles, beef, broccoli and broth.  Hubby had the Wonton Noodles so I can't really review them but he sad they were really good.  The Pan Fried Pork Bun was pretty good as well. Crispy, the pork was tender and full or flavor. Even better when dipped in the soy sauce. They were so good that even though I was full, I had to eat them all!  All in all it was a great trip and a great experience! I definitely recommend coming here!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch on a Saturday.  I ordered the tofu nuggets as an appetizer, the stir fried watercress with oyster sauce, and the beef noodle soup with tendon (wide noodles).  I ordered take out of their jellyfish appetizer and wood ear mushrooms with tofu skins.  What's Hot - Quality.  Delish!  I ordered their classic beef noodle soup with tendon, which is a traditional Taiwanese Chinese dish.  They asked if I wanted chili oil and I declined.  The mark of any good noodle soup is the broth.  If the broth is well seasoned and savory, that's a good sign.  This broth was flavorful and already had a slight spicy kick.  Additionally, their beef chunks and tendons are tender and stewed before hand.  I could definitely taste that.  They also asked me if I wanted my noodles wide or thin.  May not make sense to those who aren't Chinese food aficionados, which is cool.  But for me, that they ask is great.  I like the texture of my noodles thicker and chewy.  Gives it better flavor.  There was even a slice of daikon in my soup!  Definitely awesome.  Their stir fried watercress wasn't too oily, either.  All the food was well seasoned.   - Menu.  Classic Taiwanese Chinese dishes- jellyfish, seaweed salad, green onion pancakes, milk tea, etc...  Their menu is like Goldilocks- just right.  It's not overwhelming.  Additionally, if you have any questions about their menu items, their wait staff can answer your questions.  They're knowledgeable and helpful. - Service.  Fast and efficient.  I asked for 2 of my appetizers for takeout when I gave the waitress my order.  She had it ready at my table before my check came.  There was also a pair of chopsticks in there, too.  This place is definitely buzzing, especially because the layout is small.   - Price.  Reasonable, but can add up.  Most of the items on their menu are less than $10.  A handful of items are over $11, but not many.  However, their portions aren't family size- they're not huge.  Sharing works between 2 people, but that's it.   - Location.  It's in the heart of Squirrel Hill, which means easy accessibility.  There are plenty of other shops and restaurants around; all within walking distance.  What's Not - Parking.  There is street parking and the little side lots behind the other shops.  However, parking here is not easy when it's busy (ex: weekends). - Price.  Prices here are reasonable, but they can add up, especially if you come in a group.  For example, my total (3 appetizers, 1 veggie, and 1 noodle soup) came out a little over $40. - Layout.  This place is not good for groups.  I saw one large round table in the very back that can seat over 4 people (I think it's 8-10 people).  I don't recommend coming here with a group of over 4 people.  Their tables are for 2, which means they can accommodate groups if they push the tables together.  This means that if you come with a group of 2 or more, you're waiting.  Final Answer Willing to come back, but come first thing on a weekend to avoid the parking hassle and the wait.",

The flavor is just so authentic, and every main dish is made fresh and in house. I split the cold sesame noodles, the pork soup dumplings, and the pancake cucumber beef rolls between myself and another person. It was the perfect amount of food. 10/10 recommend the pork soup dumplings - I've never had anything like it.  Uniquely, Everyday Noodles displays the noodle making process upfront so that you can see the labor behind your dish. It can get noisy, but it's definitely an experience worth trying.",

However, the spicy noodles did not have much flavor at all, they were basically like plain noodles but with a more slick texture because of the oil. I would rate the level of spiciness at a 3/10. They are a little bit spicy but nothing that is going to make you down glasses of water.   Service at our table was very fast and attentive. A server even saw me (pathetically) struggle with my chopsticks and came over with a little plastic device to help my child self hold the chopsticks.   We were seated at a big, round table with a group of three people on the other side to save space. The table was so big that our separate groups had very decent personal space. Prices were very reasonable as well, with most items being $7-9. I will probably not come again, but only because I tried everything I was interested in on the menu.",

    "text": "Everyday Noodles is HANDS DOWN my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. If you go, you absolutely need to get the Pork Soup Dumplings because it is heaven in a spoon. If you add a little ginger to them you can hear angels sing.  My go-to aside from the dumplings are the Dan-Dan Noodles Szechuan Style with thin noodles. It's delicious, savory with a lil heat to it. The noodles with Mince Pork Sauce are also exceptional.   Overall, the food is incredible, the service is fast and friendly, and it's a cute & intimate atmosphere. Definitely a cute date spot. The only thing is that it can get crowded during peak hours, so plan ahead.",

Initially suggested by a friend, I've been here 5/6 times and I keep coming back.  Typically I order some soup dumplings to share and then some rice or dry noodles. Watching the chefs creating the noodles in the open kitchen while you're having dinner is very pleasant.  They don't take reservations, so you might have to wait. It's usually pretty crowded.",

I like their beef noodle soup, as those usually bring out the best of their flavors, and have some decently cooked eyes of beef and tendon. The soup is savory, and the noodles, although not hand-pulled, go well with the overall bowl.  As for the other items, I'm not as impressed. Their appetizers always are a let down because they taste just bland and funky.",

We ordered three dishes: beef tendon soup, pork dumplings, and green onion pancake. The soup was absolutely delicious! The tendon is so tender I felt that it could melt in my mouth (although this isn't my preference, it was amazing to see tendon become this delicate!). The soup and beef were both flavorful; the noodles were a bit bland but the texture was spot on.  Dumplings were a bit doughy (which I enjoy) although we were surprised that they didn't have as much soup within. Nevertheless they were delicious.  My friend and I were torn between the pancakes. They were crispy on the outside, doughy inside. I like doughy textures, sometimes, but my friend did not enjoy this.  Lastly, the interior is quite modern, very clean, and overall provided a great dining atmosphere. As a result the small interior I can imagine the ambient noise getting loud during a busy night. We enjoyed a pleasantly mellow evening.",

The soups were all bland. Braised beef noodle soup, oxtail noodle soup, lamb... Even the gua bao was terrible. The peanuts overpowered the whole bao. I would not recommend this place...I hope that it was just a bad day or the standards for good Chinese food is low out here.  I give it two stars for service and the xiao long bao. Service is quick.

What I don't care much are pork soup dumpling (the soup inside is not very flavorful and kinda salty), #41 shrimp/pork/veg wonton, and potstickers.  They are not bad, but just so so.

It's a sad reality we have to live with. However, given that restriction, Everyday Noodles does a pretty damn good job with dumplings and potstickers.   When you walk in, you are greeted with the noise of chatter and the pounding of fresh noodles. I was in the mood for dumplings and potstickers though, so I skipped these (for now), and got the pork & crab meat soup dumplings. These are sooo good, you can really taste every element, the pork, the crab, the soup, and as someone who generally doesn't love too much ginger (sorry for those who do), the ginger flavor isn't so strong and the whole thing is soothing and delicious.  We also got the shrimp, pork, and vegetable potstickers. Crispy fried goodness on the outside and cooked to perfection on the inside.  Speaking of dim sum, I haven't tried their shumai, but these dishes are so good, that I'll definitely be back to try more and more! I'm especially excited about their fresh noodle dishes. Until next time :)",

While waiting, you can watch the chef at work making fresh noodles and wontons through a glass display window. The best part is seeing how your food is made and knowing that it's fresh!   I ordered the dry dan tsu noodles. I didn't care much for the meat or vegetables, the noodles itself was phenomenal. You get a choice between small or large noodles. Small looks like spaghetti and large is flat and wide. I got the large noodles and would recommend the large noodles since you'll be able to taste the noodles more (the main part). The sauce and seasoning were average, but the noodles stole the show. Unlike generic noodles that tend to get soggy or rubbery, these special hand tossed noodles from Everyday Noodles have this nice firm and doughy texture.   If you are a noodles fan, I highly recommend this place--for both the food and the learning experience.",

    "text": "Not bad Pittsburgh, not bad. Everyday Noodles exceeded my expectations of Asian food in Pittsburgh! Since I'm from the Bay Area, which is filled with TONS of good Asian food, I didn't have high hopes for the Asian food in Pittsburgh, but this place is definitely not bad!  Pros: Most of the food is very good. Not the best, but I was still very impressed. The xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings) are pretty good. We got 3 or 4 noodle soups and all of them were good. We also ordered broccoli with minced pork sauce and that was good too! The decor is nice and modern, and seems pretty clean.   Cons: We got one of their milk teas and it was not very good. It had a weird, kinda watered-down taste to it, so I didn't drink much of it. The service was also just okay. They left out our order of minced pork sauce over rice, but it was okay because we were all too full anyway.   Overall: If I lived in Pittsburgh, Everyday Noodles would be one of my go-to places for Asian food! The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that it's not as good as the food in California, but it definitely is impressive for Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "In a nutshell: authentic Chinese noodles made in-house. Assortment of dumplings too.   I've been here several times and I can't say I'm entirely impressed. Although it's neat to watch the cooks make the noodles right in front of you, they seem to use the same dough for everything on their menu, which makes it easy for them to offer such a variety. However, everything I've tried just seems to taste the same because they use that same dough for everything. If you get one dumpling, you've tried them all. I've tried the potstickers, soup dumplings and pan-fried dumplings. They taste the same, just depends if you're in the mood for fried and crispy or steamed and soggy. In terms of noodles, of course the broths and toppings change the flavor but something about the ones I've tried are still so similar. I've tried the Dan tsu, Dan Dan and spicy wonton. Of the three, I like the spicy wonton most. Dan tsu has a strong 5 spice flavor and Dan Dan, I'm not a fan. Their Dan Dan noodles have a strong peanut butter taste and although that's a key ingredient, I don't think it should overpower all the other flavors.   However, I do like the bubble teas. Their bubble teas aren't overly sweetened and I like that you have the option of getting an additional topping other than tapioca. They have grass jelly and red bean which I haven't seen at many other bubble tea places.   All in all, the food is decent but I wish there was more a variety of flavors. I will continue to try new dishes each time, seeking for something that stands out from the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Blegh.  Since it seems that I've read that plenty of people think is legit authentic and great, I'm just going to write this review for the noodle soup. Part of me feels bad for giving such low stars for a small subsection of the menu, but I'm sorry, it was just that bad.  My husband ordered take out for us from here. I just told him to just order for me. He \"played it safe\" and got one beef and one chicken noodle soup. This was the blandest most boring soup ever. The stock itself was full of flavor of the meat, but that was it. It was terrifyingly simple in its flavor profile. However, what was the worst was the meat! My husband's beef was gigantic beef pieces that he had to fish out of his bowl and cut on the side to eat. I had whole chicken legs simply simmered in the broth. You know how the underside of the turkey's skin is always gross and rubbery and not all flavorful and crispy like the roasted top? That's what this horrible chicken in my soup was like (on top of being tons of gristle and fat). Noodles were simply bland and this was just all around disapointing :(((  To be honest, I don't know if I'll try this place again, but mayyyyybeeeee I might and NEVER get the noodle soups. idk, if you think this review isn't fair to the restaurant, just take it at \"don't get the noodle soups, get everything else that other people mention is good.\"",

There is usually a line waiting to be seated, but the clientele, kitchen and service staff moves quickly so the wait is usually not terrible.   The service has always been quick and professional.  The lamian (handpulled noodles), were cooked perfectly were provided just enough bite. The minced pork sauce noodles are also very flavorful. The shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup is also very good.   The pork soup dumplings are very juicy, and the shrimp-pork shaomais offer that nice crunch that you expect from shrimp (although at times you lose the bottom side of the dumpling skin and much of the liquid flavorful goodness in the steamer liner).   Portions were generous and the prices are very reasonable.  The owner, Michael Chen, can often be spotted in the restaurant and often asked customers whether they enjoyed their meals while removing their empty plates and bowls. I think that is always a good sign for a restaurant.",

    "text": "I went here twice in three days.  That's normal, right?  On a Saturday, I went in for a little snack to go.  I wanted to check out their Siu Mai (pork dumplings and shrimp) and their potstickers.  Both were amazing.  My wife and kids and I gobbled it up.  The Siu Mai had a balanced seafood and pork flavor.  The potstickers (pork and vegetable) were a perfect crispy texture but not dripping with oil and incredibly tasty.  So, on Monday, we ventured back but went for a sit down meal.  Here's what we ended up with: Pork Soup Dumplings ($9) Pork and Vegetable Potstickers ($8) Vegetable Dumplings ($9) Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Wontons - Szechuan Style ($6) Taiwanese Style Sesame Cold Noodles - ($6) Side of steamed rice - ($2)  I thought the veggie dumplings were just meh.  But everything else was just perfect.  Be sure to try the pork soup dumplings and their potstickers!  A real surprise was the Taiwanese sesame cold noodles.  I liked the peanut and vinegar balance.  It's not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.  We finished up at $52 with drinks, tax and tip.  Service was friendly and attentive.  We were seated in a long bench facing where the dumplings were being made.  Talk about dinner and a show!  This was a ton of fun for the kids and our whole family ate well.  Can't wait to be back again!  The only knock about this place - it's too small!  There are only about 36 or so seats in this place and if you don't get there early, you will be waiting for a while.  We got in right as lunch was picking up and no wait for a table.  Others coming in after us were not as lucky - so be aware.",

    "text": "Another great addition to the asian food scene in Pittsburgh, which seems to be heating up! My husband and I were so excited in the months leading up to the opening, because I have always lamented the lack of really good, authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh (although try Sichuan Gourmet for Sichuan food, and Orient Kitchen for Cantonese). When I heard that they had xiao long bao, I knew that I had to come.   I've been twice now, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself both times. While the xiao long bao isn't as good as those you might get at Joe Shanghai's in NYC or in LA, it's probably one of the few, if ONLY, places you can get them in Pittsburgh. And for that, I give them immense gratitude for giving me access to one of my favorite things to eat. For this alone, I give them five stars. The potstickers are also very large and tasty. My personal favorite noodle dish is the noodles with minced pork. The noodles are perfectly tender, and every bite is just super tasty.   Now, do I think this place is as good as the places in NYC or LA? No. But for Pittsburgh, this is probably the best. So, for example, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the braised noodle beef soup could pack a little more punch (in fact, I think Ice Tea Taipei down the street might do a little better in this department. But if you're not familiar with asian food, I think Ice Tea Taipei is kind of hard to navigate). Part of the issue is that they are catering both to people who don't have a lot of experience with Asian cuisine, while also trying to satisfy those of us who have expectations for what they should do or how things should taste. It's a fine line to walk, and I think that they do a good job of it.  The service is friendly and fast, and I love the open kitchen. If you don't want to see how your food is made, go somewhere else. But for those of us who want to be in touch with those who produce the meal, the open kitchen gives you a great peek into what goes into each dish. Come and try it!  p.s. not super veggie friendly. They do have some options, but they are extremely limited. I hear that they are going to try and change that, but just something to keep in mind.",

    "text": "I was predisposed to liking Everyday Noodles based on the cute pun in its name -- in Chinese, the word for \"noodles\" is a homonym with the word for \"face,\" so a common phrase that means \"we see each other ['s face] everyday\" sounds the same as \"we see noodles everyday.\"  Then I found out that they are going to serve soupy dumplings (xiao long bao; henceforth, XLB for short), which is my absolute favorite comfort food. When I go back to LA or Taiwan, I always make multiple pilgrimages to the mecca of XLBs: Ding Tai Fun (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-arcadia-5\">yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fun...</a>).   A good XLB should have a delicately thin but al dente skin; it should be dainty enough that it fits in one bite; and it should, above all, be piping hot (to the point of mouth burning) and bursting with juicy broth. I thought that if Everyday Noodles' XLB is anywhere near half as good as Ding Tai Fun's, I'd be thrilled.   Everyday Noodles's XLB is more than half as good as Ding Tai Fun's. I'm willing to bet that in a blind taste test, we'd find Everday and DTF in a statistical tie with 95% confidence.  Everyday runs on the same formula as DTF: a glass box kitchen that showcases the chefs making the dumplings in the front; pencils/paper order forms and efficient service, bright and cheerful decor, and sadly, a long long looooooong wait line. DTF is so famous in California that people drive up from San Diego and down from the North to eat there. Waiting for an hour or two (even if you showed up at 5pm on a week night) was just the rite of passage to XLB nirvana. At Everyday Noodles, we waited for 50 minutes, after showing up at 6:45 on a Friday night.  By Pittsburgh standard, this is a bit on the long side, but DTF has trained me to wait it out. In the end, I'm glad our patience was rewarded.  Other than the XLBs (both pork and crabmeat&pork), there are also regular dumplings, several noodle dishes, and a few standard Chinese restaurant stuff (stir fry veggies, etc.). Of the two types of XLBs, we liked the pork-only a bit better than the crab/pork mix. The veggie dumplings are also excellent, though not quite at the level of DTF's. For the noodle dishes, we tried both the dan-dan (cold) and the pork sauce (hot). Both are very good (fresh pasta just tastes better), but I'd rather save more room for various dumplings.  We also ordered some Chinese watercress in oyster sauce and an eggplant appetizer (cold); they are fine, but they are common place. Desserts are surprisingly good. Again, eat everything while it's hot!  All in all, this is a wonderful new addition to Pittsburgh. It is easily the best Chinese noodle shop this side of the continental US. If not for the (likely to grow) long lines, I really just might go see them everyday.",

They came out steaming and piping hot - 2 flavors to choose from (pork or pork and crab.)  The homemade, hand-stretched noodles were also excellent and chewy and doughy (with pork sauce on top.)    The ambiance was also very nice with noodle-themed wall decor.  Half of the diners get to watch a good view of the kitchen show, the other half are not so lucky.  Be prepared to hear the details of conversations all around you though.  So, if you've been longing to get XLBs in Pittsburgh, go here, and if you have no idea what those are, go here and find out!  Either way you're good!",

    "text": "Wow! My wife and I went to the opening night of Everyday Noodles and we are so happy to have this authentic dumpling and noodle restaurant in Squirrel Hill. We tried the Pork Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao; amazing ), the veggie dumplings (delicious), the Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce (our favorite of the night), Baby Bok Choy (some of the best I've had), and Sweet Bean Paste Crispy Pancakes for dessert (a wonderful way to end the meal). All this was eaten while watching the chefs make the dumplings and noodles from scratch through the open kitchen.   What's really amazing is that on opening night this place was packed! We were lucky and didn't have to wait, but by the time we were finished, there was a line waiting to taste the amazing food. Honestly, if we had to wait, we absolutely would.   If you're in the area and you want some hand made delicious dumplings and/or noodles, definitely give this place a try. Oh, they also have ramen-like soups, but we'll have to go again to try those!",

    "text": "Soup dumplings. That's what lured me in you can't get them in Pittsburgh and it's a huge oversight. If you aren't aware, soup dumplings are magical. They are basically a steamed pork dumpling with broth inside. You have to eat them off of a spoon so you don't lose the broth when you bite into it.   Since these are the only soup dumplings in the city, they are the best in town. However, not the best I've ever had. Again, more expensive thank what you'd pay for them in larger cities. The pork tasted a bit like sausage, which seemed just wrong. I prefer to taste the ginger and scallion that usually accompanies the pork in a dumpling.   My noodle dish, was flavorful, but contained only noodles. No meat. No vegetables. A bit disappointing if you're looking for a dish with variety.   The pork belly \"sliders\" are nothing but. You get one, and its huge. You need a fork and knife to eat it. The pork belly could have been rendered more as it was a little chewy, but the flavor was good.   This can get me through any soup dumpling cravings here, but will need a trip to NYC or Philly for the real deal.",

    "text": "I was at Pittsburgh for work for a few days, and driving into the city and craving Chinese food, Yelp led me to this place. This place serves pretty authentic Chinese food including a lot of different noodles and soup dumplings for a really reasonable price.   The place was pretty busy when we came in at around 7pm on a Sunday, and we waited for about 15 minutes. The inside of the restaurant is long and narrow and goes pretty far back. It has about two columns of tables and they're all pretty close together. We sat at an end table, and because the restaurant is so busy, it actually kind of felt like restaurants in China where there're people everywhere.  There is also an glass window where you can see people in the kitchen making the noodles.   There were two of us, and we ordered the eggplant appetizer, the beef noodle soup, one order of the soup dumplings, and noodles with minced pork sauce (zha jiang mian). Personally, I think the wide noodles taste better. The eggplant was cooked super soft and smothered in a garlic bean paste sauce. It's one of the best eggplant dish I've had in a while, especially that sauce! The beef noodle soup came in a giant bowl. It's one of the pricier items on the menu, at about $12 or so, and totally worth it. It also had a lot of beef chunks, which is different than some other places that only gives us like 3-4 chunks of beef. My zha jiang mian was also super delicious. The pork was a little too minced, but overall I still loved it. And then there was the soup dumplings! It didn't have as much soup as I liked, but the flavor was really good. Honestly, considering the slim pickings around DC where I'm from, I'm not super picky when it comes to soup dumplings.   The place was cheap, and the best part, it takes credit card. I hate that a lot of very authentic Chinese places only takes cash. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd come back here a lot! But considering that Pittsburgh has so many amazingly rated restaurants, I will be going to other newer places. If I get a chance though...I'm coming back.",

Much more organized than most places at this stage - we had good service although the place filled quickly.  Soup dumplings were very good, temperature and texture just right.  Hand-pulled noodle soup with wontons was excellent - the noodles stand up against some we had recently in Hong Kong.  Green onion pancake was great - chewy and with the perfect inside texture and salty oniony goodness.  Hot tea was kept filled and hot throughout our visit - something I've wished for in Pittsburgh forever.    Overall, super.  Can't wait to go back.",

I know your nose is supposed to adjust to smells pretty fast so I decided to push past the signal my nostrils were sending to my brain.

The Szechuan style dumplings and noodles are not authentic, tasting ok; the noodles tasting more like the Shanghainese cold noodle.   The pork soup dumplings have very good skins, but I would say that the meat needs to be more firm and less greasy. Although in general, I am happy to see such quality in a city like Pittsburgh.  I guess the restaurant is Taiwanese, so anything close to the Taiwanese cuisine are a lot better than those that are not that close.",

Squirrel Hill is not my neighborhood so I had to trust the tastes of my friends and I'm glad I did. This joint rocked my world. I was in a group of 11 people so that meant some awesome non committal family style sharing was going on. I personally ordered beef stew/ soup and a pork belly slider and a Thai bubble tea. First off the slider is huge it's a slugger! Slider to me would be those lil tiny hamburgers from that glistening castle in the sky known as White Castle. It comes on a steamed bun amazing. The meat was perfect not greasy and the ground up peanuts gave it a sweet appeal. I also tried the soup dumplings. What magical sacks of flavor are these ????? Give the man or woman who figured out you could steam cook a dumpling with liquid inside a high five. The spicy eggplant tasted savory just like meat, making me reconsider my eating ways til I remembered how good fried chicken is. I tried the fried tofu just meh, baby Bok Choy meh and the cucumber pickle was raw .... My beef soup was ok and I brought it home to my Taiwanese partner who declared it ok to good, but this is a man who eats this stuff in Taipei every year. My son enjoyed his plain wide noodles and all was right with the world.",

I was the only single in the restaurant and didn't like being seated separate from the rest, a bit lonely with only the soy sauce containers, napkins and computer to keep me company. Ordered the braised beef and tendon noodle soup and pickled cucumber appetizer. Shouldn't call these pickles as there was no vinegar, more of a veggie in brine plate. A little sweet and sour would have gone nice with what I knew would a salty soup. Beef was tender, and noodles perfectly chewy. Was a giant bowl with a lot of meat. Got two pieces of broccoli and one small slice of daikon, would have preferred a bit more veggies and less meat. Also wish the broth was more flavorful. Overall, a good experience for a fast in and out experience. Wouldn't bring anyone to impress them with my foodie skills, but satisfying when it's raining and you're hungry and you need a hot meal 10 minutes ago. By the way, don't order the beef and tendon unless you're adventurous, ok with eating fatty food, or grew up with this tradition dish. Most western tastes don't like the dish I find.",

Clear trans parent glass gives the spatial and cleanliness feeling, but if you look closely, the finger nails of the guys in the kitchen are black!  Debating between 2 and 3 stars .... Decide to give it a 3 because of the service ...",

First of all, the interior is very inviting, with a clear view of the kitchen, tasteful decor, and a cozy seating area. More importantly, the generously-portioned food is fresh, inventive, and of high qualty, especially considering the very low prices. I was especially fond of the pork belly slider. Everyday Noodles figures to become my go-to for Chinese in Squirrel Hill.",

Great consistency in the dough, good flavor in the filling. Their soup dumplings, especially, are heavenly.  And if this were all that they served, I'd be giving a four-star review right now.  However, their soups have let me down -- the noodles are certainly adequate (though I would like a bit more chewiness), but the broth in both soups I've been able to sample isn't very flavorful. And my dining companion noted that the braised beef was actually tough in her soup.  I will be returning, but I will likely be staying away from the soups.",

He was disappointed because the rice was dry (I gave him some of my sauce).

Word has gotten out quickly about this place, and even though it has been open only a few weeks, we had to wait 15 minutes or so.  And, boy was it worth it.  Our table was facing the kitchen and we were amazed and entertained by the guy behind the window making the noodles.  Every batch is made separately and by hand.  The way he flicks the noodles around which result in flat ones or thin round ones was very impressive.  More importantly the soupy dumplings, Rolled onion pancakes with beef, and the dan dan noodles were my three favorites.  We had both the pork and pork/carb soupy dumplings.  We couldn't agree which were better - you should have them both!",

Didn't get a chance to try anything too adventurous my first time here, but will in the future. Had wood ears and tofu skins for appetizer, was delicious. Then we shared the vegetable dumplings, which were great with the homemade soy sauce and piping hot when delivered in the steaming basket. Then the soups came. My friend had gotten the dan dan noodles, which were spicy in a great way along with a sesame/oil sauce that he wanted to spoon into his mouth after he finished. I got the Wonton noodle soup which came with freshly wrapped pork/veggie wontons, and the housemade noodles (which were hand spun right in front of us as we got to sit in front of the chef window) that came with a spicy oil sauce. Wonderful. Wait staff was great, and even kindly entertained some questions others would have had trouble with.   All in all, great little place in squirrel hill, and right across from Tutti Frutti for dessert.",

    "text": "I like it.  I am a fan of soups and dumplings.  I went back two times.  I tried their braised beef soup, soup dumplings, their braised pork with rice dish, and their tapioca milk tea.  The braised beef soup was good.  It was a generous portion.  Thick pieces of meat, lots of noodles, and a nice broth.  The broth was light.  It isn't as hearty as Pho.  I don't think I can eat it everyday like I can Pho.  The meat was soft and tasted good.  There are tons of noodles which I didn't finish.  I know everyone makes a big deal about how the noodles are fresh and made everyday.  Eh -- I don't think that's really important.  It is pretty annoying when they are making it and slamming the dough on the table every few minutes.  Their dumplings were good.  I tried several different kinds.  They were a little small but I found them to be tasty.  Their braised pork with rice was really good.  It had a side of boiled egg and some pickled vegetable.  There was a little too much fat on the pork but I found it delicious.  I tried their black tea flavored tapioca milk tea with grass jelly and coconut jelly.  I am pretty disappointed at the taste.  I didn't think it was very good and tasted nothing like tapioca milk tea.    I came here during a Wed and Satruday.  Saturday was super busy.  I don't think I saw my waitress again after the initial ordering.  The Wednesday was slower.  But I had an issue with my drink.  The support staff to the waitress doesn't seem to know what they're doing.  But the waitress was extremely nice.  Overall, I did like the food and I do see myself coming back.",

None of us were big fan of their soup dumplings though. My only complaint is the waiting time. 5 pm Sunday night, Pitt spring break, and there was already a line waiting for a table! Ok, I get it. This is Pittsburgh, where people get excited when a new Asian restaurant opens. However, the food simply doesn't worth any waiting longer than 10 minutes! Actually, I was very fortunate to get there by 4.30, and didn't wait that long for a table. But seeing all those people waiting, I felt the pressure to finish quick and let those poor people have their meals. I would prefer to spend my cozy Sunday night in a less popular place.",

We have tried: Szechuan style wontons- these came with spicy glass noodles as well as the wontons. Very nice with lots of heat  Pork vegetable and shrimp pot stickers- I adore that these are steamed and then friend like a pancake and you have to break the pot stickers out. They were yummy and so uniquely presented! Pan fried green onion pancake- Chris wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't something he would order again. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, but when everything else is so good you just can't waste stomach room on less than stellar items Pork soup dumplings- these have a darker soup broth which gives them a completely different flavor than the pork and crab soup dumplings. They are filled with warm soup and really good Pork and shrimp shu mai- these are one of my favorites. Tons of flavor, try them with some red oil. Pork and crab meat soup dumplings- these are hands down one of the top 10 best things I've ever eaten! The broth in these is light and loaded with flavor. I would eat an entire bowl of just the broth! And then you get the awesome meaty filling. Good lord they are divine! We still haven't made it back for a Sunday to try the shrimp with loofah soup dumplings, hopefully soon!",

We went in on a Saturday night around 8 o'clock and were greeted by a friendly hostess, told the wait was about twenty minutes, not bad at all for a Sat night.  We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, pork soup dumplings, onion pancake, and finished it wish some doughy yolky dessert  all was top notch!  Service was FAST and very friendly.  Will be back again!",

I had the sesame cold noodles for my entree, which were refreshing on a summer day and were delicious. All of the buns were bizarre but flavorful from the pork belly ones to the two kinds we had for dessert (the 'crispy creamy' and the 'sweet egg yolk'). The server we had was cool and so were the interiors.  Oh, I forgot to mention the soup dumplings. I'd never had them before, and I'm in love. Ours were filled with pork and crab. Awesome. Go.",

The taste was really local and great.  Also we met the restaurant owner there. We chat for a while and he was really nice. He asked if the foods are OK and changed a new bubble milk tea for us when he knew we thought the tea was too sweet.  Although the prices here are higher than average, I still think it's a really good place to go.",

    "text": "I really want to give Everyday Noodles one more star, but in the end I cannot because I honestly don't think that their food is worth the price. That said, their food is really comforting. I've tried many of their noodle dishes, including braised beef, beef tendon, oxtail, pork rib, dan dan mian, and more. The noodles and broth are very good (not too salty like many other places make their noodles), and the meat is delicious and tender. In addition, good things can be said about their small dishes, including the pancake dessert and potstickers.  But EN, just WHY must your prices be so high? I would be happy if they were actually a lot more authentic like some of the stuff that Rose Tea serves across the street, but most of what they do are well-intended imitations at best. I would also be happy if the quantity matched the price, but the amount of noodles and vegetables don't come close to the noodles served by Taiwan or Szechuan Express in Oakland (the meat is better at least). I really don't find a bowl of $11 noodles worth it when I can get a slightly lower quality bowl but with a more authentic feel at Sichuan Gourmet for half the price.  As much as I hate to mention it, this place is much more gentrified than the aforementioned ones. It caters to American customers more so than the others (rather than Chinese students), which is why it is justified in their pricing choices. I would come here once in a while if I'm craving some comfort food in addition to maybe a dim sum or two, but normally I'd probably go and spend a few bucks more for a much more ethnic dish at Rose Tea or Sichuan Gourmet.",

Whenever I eat here, I always get one to drink with my meal even if I'm not that hungry.  Their pork soup dumplings are wonderfully tasty. They usually give you ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, and hot sauce to pair with them.  Another delicious dish to get is the braised beef and tendon noodle soup. The meat is so juicy and tender, and the soup is full of flavor. For noodles, I strongly suggest getting their wide noodles over the thin by the way.  There are a few large tables, so it's also a good place for larger parties of 4+ (and as long as you don't go during peak hours you won't have to wait too long for a table).",

The taste was definitely not as salty as other variations I've eaten before. Bonus points.  No. 3 ($5), wood ears with tofu skins and cilantro, is a light dish with special flavor.   This restaurant is well-managed. The staff really are \"in the zone.\" You really get a sense of how focused the cooks are as you watch them constantly prepare an endless supply of noodles and dumplings by hand behind the counter. Waiters are busy either picking up new orders or delivering checks to customers. They're almost too fast! On the one hand my dishes arrived no more than five minutes after I placed my order.  On the other hand, both plates arrived at the same time. I wish I would have received my \"appetizer\" first. Some may find the service to be a little curt, but at least you won't feel tempted to over-tip ;)  Nevertheless, the food is what really matters for me. I'm determined to eat my way through Everyday Noodles, one blob of dough at a time.",

How in the world have I lived my life up to this point without ever knowing about or trying soup dumplings before? It was just one of those foods that changed EVERYTHING for me. I have been here several times since then and it is always top notch, consistent, modern, clean, and fun. It is always great for my kids to watch when they are making the noodles. I have tried their soup dumplings, spicy noodles ( I forget exactly what they are called), pork belly buns, and pork potstickers. Everything is honestly so good. Parking can be difficult sometimes but if you pull around to the back there is usually parking back there if there is no luck on the main street. This restaurant is the best Asian restaurant I have ever been to. My mother patiently waited a year to come back to this place when we went a few days back. I have also taken my in-laws. I always recommend this place to friends around here. This might just be my favorite place in Pittsburgh.",

I'm super glad I tried this place out, and I will totally be back.  Our server was quick, efficient, and gave me a bunch of recommendations, which was awesome.  She recommended the spicy wonton noodles with flour (thin) noodles.  At $7, this was beyond worth it.  The portion was massive, and the spicy was good but not overwhelming.  I made two and a half meals out of the portion.  I also split the vegetable soup dumplings ($9) with my roommate, and I really enjoyed them.  If you're on a budget, they are pricey compared to the portion vs some of the other options.  But I really enjoyed the dumplings so if you aren't counting pennies, definitely try them!  This place gets busy, but there is quite a bit of seating packed into the store.  It is rather crowded, but they can't help that their food is good!",

We saw the lady wrapping it at the table. The pork belly had the authentic flavors but the pork was dry and they used way too much parsley.   The soup dumplings were yummy but they should have left the steamer lid on. They got cold very fast. The noodles with peanut sauce was very rich and savory. We had it with the thick noodles.   The bubble tea is pretty close to authentic. It taste better than a lot of places I've tried and you can taste the real tea flavor.   The service was a little slow. We sat down and we're ignored for about ten mins. No water. No greeting. Nothing.   Overall a nice place. A little pricey but the food was yummy.",

    "text": "I haven't had any proper noodles in quite a while since I left my home town. Since I entered Pittsburgh, I haven't had the time, nor the money to afford this oriental commodity. Now that I do, I will tell you: It was worth the wait.   When I walked in, I was immediately met with great service and seating. I actually quite liked the checklist type of menu. As was looking through their menu, I kept hearing a loud noise behind me but paid it no mind, of course, that was until it continued for the next 5 minutes. Finally I gave into my irritation and curiosity and turned around. To my surprise, I saw a crew of cooks making the noodles from scratch. And the noise that was being made was the sound of the dough being worked on, then solidified with a whip-like slam. To add to the excitement, there was a table right next to the window where they were cooking so those seated there were able to watch them make theor food. My irritation immediately turned into admiration.   The waitress was was very kind and informative. I ordered the Shrimp and Pork Wonton Noodle Soup, as well as the San Dan Noodles Szechuan Style as she recommended. I like the fact that I was given the option of the classic thin noodles or the fat and flat style. Personally, I prefer the classic thin because the larger noodle has a harder time retaining the flavor as the smaller one.  My order came to my table about 3 minutes after ordering, so I really appreciated the instant service. However, one could be reasonably skeptical if your food was made that fast as some may ask: What about the quality of the food? And to answer that, I have placed my thoughts on each dish below.  Shrimp and Pork Wonton Noodle Soup: The broth was the first thing that I tasted, which later would  also bring the whole dish together. It was light - which I and all of those who have exercised after a meal would appreciate - yet still managed to keep its flavor. The noodles were standard but still done well. As for the wontons, or dumplings as some may call it, they were good. Nothing to write home about, but still good enough to not be a soggy distraction in my bowl as most other establishments fall victim to. This was a very refreshing dish and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  San Dan Noodles Szechuan Style:  Same as last, the first thing I tasted was the broth(sauce?). I liked how they capitalized on the sesame flavor. It was spicy and savory, but neither overpowered the other. As for the noodles, they mixed well with the broth but I feel as though I definitely should have gotten the thinner noodles for this one. Still, the balance of this dish was excellent and allowed me to enjoy 2 different flavors equally. Note: This dish is pretty spicy(not actually though), so beware.  Final Judgements:  There was one moment particularly  that stuck in my head: I completed one meal and wanted to box the other, so I took out my wallet and began to look around. My actions were immediately met with exactly what I wanted, and no words were ever uttered from my mouth. That basically sums up what my experience was in this establishment. What I wanted was a quick, good quality, economically reasonable place to eat noodles, and I got it.  I am not a noodle coneseur, but when it comes down to it, I have been around the block. And for that, my personal rating on it is 4 stars. However, as the fellow common man consumer, it does more than satisfy me, so I will give it a 5 stars.   Anyone In the squirrel hill area? Give this restaurant a try!",

We had the dan dan noodles and the cold sesame noodles - both managed to be comfort food but not boring in the slightest. The potstickers are a must try - made in house and delivered as one large sheet to be divided up.  My boyfriend hates onions and even he enjoyed them despite scallions in the filling.   Will definitely be eating here regularly.",

The first time, my mom and I ordered the shrimp and pork wonton soup to share! You got 8 wontons in a big bowl which is perfect for sharing.  For my meal, I ordered the Dan Dan noodles and my mom ordered the hot and spicy wonton noodles. I really really liked the Dan Dan noodles! It was a bit spicy but nothing I couldn't handle.   The second time I ordered take out. I ended up getting the pork soup dumplings and the hot and spicy wonton noodles. I had high hopes for the soup dumplings because I heard a lot of great things about them. Sadly I wish I could say I liked them, but I didn't. The pork inside did not look cooked at all and did not taste cooked. So I threw the dumplings out. There also wasn't a lot of soy sauce inside the dumplings. I would have to say that the soup dumplings I have ordered at jimmy wans taste a lot better and have more soy sauce in them, which I like! The only thing is you get 4 soup dumplings at JWs instead of the 8 at Everyday Noodles. For my meal I ordered the hot and spicy wonton noodles. The title says it all, this dish was extremely spicy! I definitely prefer the Dan Dan noodles over this.   I would come back to dine here because I would like to try some other dishes, but I know I wont be getting the soup dumplings. The pricing is extremely reasonable and you really do get a lot of food!",

    "text": "We stopped here for dinner today since we are in town visiting, and I wasn't sure what to expect. When we walked in, there was a window peering into the kitchen where a cook was rolling out the dough (is it called dough?) to make homemade noodles! I instantly got excited. They make all of their noodles in house, fresh.. which I didn't even know. I ordered the oxtail noodle soup and an order of pork soup dumplings to share. The noodle soup had a basic, but flavorful broth and I ordered the thin noodles.. you could tell from the soft, slight chewiness that the noodles were homemade and the oxtail meat was fall-off-the-bone, which is how it should be. It also had a fiew pieces of cooked broccoli, radish, and ginger in it, which was a nice touch.  Then there were the soup dumplings... o.m.g. These were the BOMB. They had so much flavor and the dumpling wrapping was delicious as well. The side of fresh, julienned ginger went perfectly with them. To finish off the meal, I had a black milk tea with red beans and grass jelly and it was a-mazing. I could tell it was real tea and not a powder mix.  So if you're in town and want to try a unique restaurant, I would definitely go here if you want some authentic Chinese food. The service was also extremely fast.. it came out in a little over 5 minutes of ordering! What?! Now that's some great service.",

I went with the braised beef soup bowl which I had mixed feelings about. The broth itself was perfectly balanced, just could've used a little more heat. I went with the wide noodles, and as unique as the experience is of them being made in house, they didn't leave a lasting impression. Good, not great. The beef itself had so many tendons and a lot of fat which made it hard to chew let alone stomach.  We also had the broccoli with minced pork sauce which was disappointing. The pork had an \"off\" jerky taste, and we barely ate any of it.  We'd definitely come back to try some other dishes as they have your food out to you in about 5 minutes.",

Sometimes we'll each order a noodle entree and it will be more than enough food. I recommend eating the soup dumplings with their chili paste sprinkled on top.   On the weekend, be prepared for a bit of a wait as the dining area is small. If you get to sit by the window and watch the chefs make the noodles and dumplings, go for it!",

Atmosphere aside, the dishes were authentic and delicious. They have a pretty extensive menu, but it's called \"Everyday Noodles\" so unless you are a regular, you are foolish not to choose a noodle dish. Seriously, skip the rice, go straight for the noodles!!!  Food Suggestions: Dan Dan Noodles if you like spicy, Taiwanese Style Dan Tsu Noodles if you don't. Side of wonderfully steamed baby bok choy and if you are with a group, share some dim sum. I especially enjoyed the  pork and vegetable potstickers.   If you have room for dessert, which I always do, try the sweet egg yolk steamed bun. I have been looking for this ever since I left Singapore and this is a pretty good imitation!",

I especially especially love the one staff that is super buff and all he does is throws the dough in the air so it fluff out and he just pretty much repeats this process. Anyhow ~ was for the food I thought everything was very wisely priced. And my favorite was the lamb soup it had lots of meat and goji berries. I also like the steamed soup dumplings . But the Dan Dan noodle was a pure disappointment due to the extreme overloading of the peanut butter sauce . The sauce was so over powering that it completely ruined the taste of the hand pulled noodles.   I also thought the service was a little too \"Asian\" as the check came to us without even us asking for the check. Almost felt like they wanted to rush us out ASAP.   Oh the wonton with the chili oil !! That was another disappointment so if you go; stick with the soup dumplings :) can't go wrong with the staples of this place.",

The noodles were a bit bland and the sauce was not as spicy as I generally prefer. The food was good, but I would not go out of my way to come back.

We had 2 steaming servings along with pickled cucumbers, dan dan noodles, tofu skin, and pan fried pork buns. Everything was pretty tasty, but not exactly authentic per se. The dan dan noodles were drenched in a sesame-based sauce, which is a far cry from the chili oil it's typically served with. That being said - we still did finish every last noodle in the bowl...  If you want a meal and a show (AKA hand-pulling of the noodles or making the dumplings), make sure to sit in front of the big glass window near the front of the restaurant!",

The milk tea was also a great option with boba plus 2 toppings of your choice included in the price. I got the thai tea, which tasted a bit watery, but all in all, was a great deal for the price. For food, I ordered the traditional beef noodle soup and enjoyed the hearty bowl of noodles. Good amount of beef accompanied the noodles, and the soup was very flavorful, but not overly so.   They were busy when I came on a weekday evening, but not so busy that they were completely full. Good amount of seating, including some long benches and a round table in the back. Service was excellent, I was greeted promptly upon entering and staff checked in with me throughout the meal. Food and drinks were also served quite quickly. They also do takeout, so that's also an option, but noodle soup is definitely best enjoyed in house. All in all, happy I found this place while wandering around and I can definitely have Everyday Noodles everyday :)",

I was in the area and wanted some bubble tea, went to a place across the street and they said that they were out of tapioca balls so I ended up here. My first thought walking in was how cool it was watching the noodles be made. Actually watching everything be made. Another thing I noticed was the cleanliness, it all seemed extremely clean and very well kept.   I ordered a Thai tea bubble tea. It was pretty standard and good no issues with it. However I really respect that they use plastic film Instead of lids. The straw pushes right through and less plastic being used (obviously it's still in a plastic cup but still, there's effort) it also was a pretty good size compared to other bubble teas. I will definitely come back and order food.",

My friend and I shared the five-spice eggplant and the steamed vegetable dumplings. Both dishes were tasty without being greasy.

    "text": "Clean, bustling restaurant with solid Taiwanese dishes! Came here around 7:30 and waited a solid 45 minutes before we were able to be seated. Fortunately, service here is REALLY FAST and our first dish came out within 5 minutes of ordering. We got the braised beef noodle soup, bok choy with oyster sauce, pork soup dumplings, and minced pork noodles (zhajiangmian). Everything was really good. You can choose either thin or thick noodles - we got thin for both and it was pretty good.  Beef noodle soup - definitely hits the spot when you're having a craving. Large pieces of beef and good broth (just slightly bland for my taste) I was surprised to see broccoli in my bowl though as I'm more accustomed to bok choy.  Bok choy - not much to report here. Good serving size and you have the option of either pork or oyster sauce. Server recommends oyster sauce.  Minced pork noodles - this was amazing. It reminded me so much of home and the ratio of noodle to toppings was perfect. This is not the sweet kind of bean sauce FYI and make sure you mix this thoroughly! I will definitely order again.  Soup dumplings - did not have high expectations for this to be honest but these were actually very good! They're on the smaller side but the peels were thin enough to not be overly chewy and still thick enough that they don't break easily. Comes with the vinegar sauce and optional ginger (I recommend). So good and glad that there's a good soup dumplings place in Pittsburgh!",

Also if we are being honest, it was pricey...but I guess when you don't have competitors you can take advantage of that. I was very happy to hear from friends that a restaurant had finally opened serving fresh xiao long baos, yay the Midwest is finally catching up with the big cities! The food though was just ok. I felt the filling in the xiao long baos to be a bit too salty. I think I drank at least 3 cups of tea while eating them. The beef rolls were decent, and the beef noodle soup was ok. The beef was tender in the beef noodle soup, but I thought the soup base was nothing memorable. I've also rarely seen broccoli in traditional beef noodle soup, but I'm not really going to complain about that since I do love broccoli...but just a little different from what I've had before? I think I enjoyed the pork over rice dish the best out of everything I tried. In my opinion if they changed the filling of the xiao long baos I would totally come back just to eat those. That would be worth the two hour drive! Yes...when you're desperate you make that sort of crazy effort to fulfill your cravings...and no I'm not preggers...but just imagine if I was?!",

I was happy to see that they have authentic bubble tea plus some interesting add-ons. I tried a black  tea plus coconut jelly and it was quite tasty. Their drinks are pricey, almost $5, but larger than other places that serve bubble tea. And it was tasty for sure!  The third time my husband visited to pick me up a bubble tea and they inexplicably added coffee to my black tea and kept insisting that was how it was made, which confused both of us. I asked for a green tea instead and they did replace it (though not happily). This version for some reason had rosewater in it, which also confused both of us.  It was NOT tasty that time, but I'll chalk it up to a new employee or something and likely get tea again in the future.  Looking forward to trying the food soon. One thing I did notice was that the sound of them slamming the homemade noodle dough on the marble slab was awfully jarring; I hope it's something that you get used to after being in their for a while! This feature probably makes it not the best place for sleeping infants though.",

Unfortunately I had just come back from playing basketball in extreme heat and my system was a little maladjusted. So it may not necessarily be the fault of the establishment that it fell short of 5 stars. However, relatively speaking I still find Raman Bar to be so far the best.  The service was friendly and some of the staff even bowed in staying with tradition and authenticity of the culture. I'd like to try this place again next time without preceding it with a rigorous workout in the heat of summer.",

Ordering the Dan Dan Noodles and Pork Belly Slider, I had high hopes for the former and no expectations for the latter. Slider was out basically within seconds, noodles within 5 minutes.  The 'slider' was huge! It covered the entire plate. Inside was very tender, well seasoned, braised pork belly. Really good contrast with the fluffy steamed bun. $6 sounded like a lot, but it was a sandwich - not a slider.  For the main dish, the noodles are awesome. No joke, as good a noodle as you'll get. Sitting on the bench in front of the noodle maker is a nice treat when you're walking in for a 'table of one'.   It was the noodle soup that threw me off guard. First, I was not really expecting that much soup as these are, as advertised, 'dry' noodles. Not a big deal, but it 100% tasted like Sun Noodle's brand frozen Dan Dan Noodles. It was absolutely uncanny. I'm not suggesting that Everyday Noodles aren't making everything from scratch, clearly their noodles are.  Maybe Sun Noodles has cracked the code on ready-made broth. Who knows.  As I mentioned, I'd absolutely go again and recommend swinging by if you're looking for Taiwanese food.",

The room is very nice (although the tables are quite close to one another), and was quite busy when we were there. The hosts and waiters were very friendly, and came to see us a few times. You can see the staff make the noodles, which is worth watching.  The food is tasty. We had the beef tendons noodle soup - the broth was tasty. The tendons were fat - as they should -  and very meaty. Not for every taste, but I liked it. The soup dumplings were good, although I have better ones.   The two appetizers - wood ears and tofu skin - and five spice eggplant, were fresh and light. We particularly enjoyed the tofu skin. A wonderful appetizer.   The food is a bit americanized - for instance, the szechuan dishes have the right taste, but are not very spicy. But in a good way: this is subtle and tasty.  Price-wise, this is also very reasonable. Be ready to wait, however.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've lived in Squirrel Hill this long and haven't tried Everyday Noodles since last week. It was excellent!   My friend and I got a front row seat on the bench right in front of the window where the noodles and dumplings were being made. Sitting right there led to a bit louder experience than others since the chefs were throwing large slabs of dough (I won't ruin it for you all!) but it wasn't overly intrusive, just something to think about.  We started with the Soup Dumplings. I've never had soup dumplings in the past but these were unbelievable, definitely the highlight of the dinner. The dumplings were steaming hot, full of flavorful broth and well seasoned meat. The dumpling was a great texture, not too chewy, and it came with fresh ginger and soy sauce.  Next up was #46 Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. That was a nice dish, smooth brown sauce with an almost smoky taste and minced pork served with wide noodles. It was not overly flavorful but simple and good. We also had the #38 Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake and while I don't usually eat onions alone, this was excellent. Crispy on the outside with great flavor (wasn't oniony in my opinion). We rounded out the dinner with some vegetables, Broccoli in the brown sauce.  All of this to say, this visit was a great first taste of what Everyday Noodles has to offer. I am definitely looking forward to going back in the future to explore more of their menu options!",

    "text": "We love everyday noodles and regularly order take out or delivery. Take out is great--ready for pick up in 15 minutes no matter how crowded. Delivery can take up to an hour on a busy Friday or Saturday. Eating there is nice too, but it's a little crowded and loud for my taste (especially with them making the noodles at the window, which is pretty loud).   From the menu:  You can't go wrong with any of the noodle soups--the freshly made noodles are wonderful. The beef from the beef noodle soup is melt in your mouth tender and, my personal favorite, the pork and shrimp wanton is very tasty. No matter what you get, the broth is always outstanding, and especially comforting on a cold day or if you are sick! Other recommendations include the soup dumplings and the steamed vegetables with the pork sauce.",

I had the Szechuan noodles dan Dan style with the thick noodles. Loved it and not too spicy. About a 5 on my scale.   Wife had the chicken noodle soup. She loved the broth and had the thin noodles. Chicken was fall off the bone tender but could use some better color. They looked a little plain but not a big deal. It's not chunks of chicken but normal chicken wings that you eat with hot sauce. But still was very good.   Server was great. Fast, friendly and made some good suggestions.   No complaints here. Would have loved to sit under the umbrella on Forbes but it rained. Only has three outside tables :(  See you again soon.",

    "text": "I had read a little about this place and was pretty curious to check it out. We are pretty much novices to this style of asian cuisine but here is what we go and our impressions:  Pork Belly Sliders - well when I think of sliders I expect them to be really small. The portion was pretty big the issue was we just did not like the spices used to flavor it. It may be just something that you have to like to appreciate - for instance, I really just am not a fan of cilantro and there was a good bit of it on there as well as other spices we did not care for.   Wonton dry Noodles - Like others have mentioned - I was expecting a lot more noodle options - perhaps they will be expanding the option but you stick the word noodles in the name of your place and I expect to see more than four options. That said, this was the best thing we ate. The noodles were lovely and I loved the wonton dumplings. I was actually thinking about them the next day and really cannot wait to go back and get more!  Scallion pancakes - I have had these at a number of places and really love them. These were not my favorite. In fact, I prefer the ones across the street at rose tree cafe. My husband, however, really enjoyed them.   Would I go back? totally and plan to!",

Hmmm...I'll try soup...nope-was told by the waitress that all of the soup broth is made with chicken and pork. Dan Dan noodles-those sound good. Nope, crumbled pork. Dumplings...must have dumplings. Nope...pork based soup and pork in every dumpling. So the next question to the waitstaff-what doesn't have pork. Well, the broccoli and steamed iceberg lettuce!! YUM!!! Who doesn't like steamed iceberg lettuce for dinner!?!?!  We were able to get the cold sesame noodles with chicken and the beef and rice. Sounds good. Well, not really. The chicken in the sesame noodles tasted very fatty and had little other flavor. The beef and rice dish was very sweet. We returned that dish to the kitchen and they were very nice about that. Bubble tea...love bubble tea. Well, no it is all milk tea. Can you not put milk in it? No. Why? The drinks are all powder drinks. Hmm, that's not tea to me. The crunchy tofu dish was very good, I must say!! But, a full dinner meal it does not make. I've been here several times forgetting my experience the time before. But, I think I got this. Not going back. I think the deal was sealed when we were leaving and noticed someone in the kitchen eating their meal over the same counter where food was being prepared.  I don't think they'll miss me. It is always crowded. Just not my thing.",

Beef noodle soup: noodles are too soft and it didn't have the texture that I was looking for.. Broth is kinda light and doesn't have much beef flavor to it.. Beef is not tender and the beef does not retain the original beef taste..   Spicy wonton with noodle and veggie: the worst item... The wontons were not fully cooked..tasted some powder from the wontons...it is just not authentic Chinese food..  I would not recommend this if you are looking for authentic Chinese/ Taiwanese food..  Pork soup dumpling: the only acceptable items that I ordered... It is good but I didn't really amaze me..

Service has always been quick and attentive, refilling water, etc., before I have to ask.  Definitely get the pork soup dumplings. The Sunday shrimp and loofah ones are still good, but they don't quite match up to the pork version. My go-to order is pork soup dumplings, eggplant, and bok choy with oyster sauce. I have also tried and enjoyed the shumai, pork belly bun, beef shank, and wonton noodle soup. I've tried a few noodle soups and the Dan Dan noodles, but was not impressed and would not get them again.",

The beef was tender, but I enjoyed the spicy wontons much more. My friend had the vegetable dumplings which he seemed to enjoy. We walked right in and were seated by the hostess. Everyone was really nice. We will definitely return here! Oh, and know that there is a $15 minimum to use a debit card. There's an ATM at the entrance if you want to use cash.",

    "text": "I expected a lot more from all the raving Yelp reviews but everything was just okay. There was no wait on a Wednesday night and my family and I were seated promptly. There are paper menus and pencils at each table for you to place your order.  The service was slow and inattentive. The server seemed reluctant to interact with us and it was honestly really off putting. We were seated for at least 10 minutes before she came and asked us if we'd like anything to drink. Since both tea and water are generally offered at Asian restaurants, I asked for tea, assuming it would be complimentary. However, if I hadn't looked at the menu myself, I wouldn't have known it cost $2.50 a cup. I feel like that's something that the server should have informed us of beforehand. When I tried to motion for a server to place the order, nobody really paid attention and they were socializing instead.   We ordered the braised beef noodle soup ($11), braised beef and tendon noodle soup ($11), and pork spare rib noodle soup consomme ($9), all with wide noodles. Our food came quickly once we ordered. I've been craving beef noodle soup since I had it in Taiwan but this was disappointing. The broth was too salty and the noodles were overcooked. Handpicked noodles are supposed to be chewy, but these were too soft and didn't have much \"elasticity.\" I did appreciate how tender the meat was though. My grandpa praised how rich the broth in the pork spare rib noodle soup was.   This spot was average in terms of food and service and not worth the price (in NYC, you can get something even better for under $8).",

    "text": "I came here expecting great, authentic Taiwanese noodles from recommendations from friends and Yelp reviews that raved about this place. Unfortunately, the noodle soups didn't quite live up to my standards.   Let's start with the good stuff: - Bubble teas taste great (I had jasmine green milk tea w/grass jelly) - Jellyfish appetizer was nicely pickled and fresh - Soup dumplings are pretty tasty too. Good thin dough, good flavor - Beef in scallion pancake was really savory. Thumbs up - Noodles itself had a good texture. Doughy, slightly chewy, just the way I like my hand-tossed noodles - Good, friendly service  Now the part for me that broke the deal was that the actual taste of the noodle dishes was completely bland.  - Ox tail soup - Soup was pretty much tasteless to me... - Zha Jiang mien - flavor was lacking in the sauce. Tasted to me like they just took a scoop of the Chinese bean sauce and mixed it in. (They did give a good portion of toppings and cucumbers, though)  They also refused to accommodate a take-out order for me where the noodles are packed separately and uncooked. This was 30 minutes before the restaurant closed so the kitchen should still be open ....  For a noodle restaurant, I expected more from the noodle staples. Sorry!  I would come back here for the milk teas and appetizers, though.",

We order a few items to share which include rice, potstickers, soup dumplings, and spicy wonton noodles. Let me tell you, when they say spicy they mean it! They are not for the faint of heart that's for sure. They also have shrimp dumplings in them which are delicious. I love getting to sit by the work windows where you can watch them make all the noodles. The service is fast and the atmosphere is relaxed. It's a small place inside but defiantly worth the wait!",

Too bad my wallet was kinda light that day..  The xiao long bao was fantastic as well. Freshly made to order (right in front of the restaurant). Each bite was bursting with flavor! I recommend you eat it right away before it gets cold because it's best eaten right off the steamer.   The prices for this place isn't too expensive. Most (if not all) dishes are below $10.

I got the broccoli with oyster sauce and the vegetable dumplings, while my boyfriend got the crab and pork soup dumplings. About halfway through my dumplings, I looked at my boyfriend and said I didn't want the meal to end. Just writing this I am thinking about those dumplings and craving them again. The dough was the perfect consistency and the vegetables had such a great flavor.   I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Oh the high reviews for Everyday Noodles.. I was super excited for some authentic Taiwanese food and some handmade noodles! I can see the hype around this place but after trying so many dishes, we really didn't get what the hype was about. We had to wait about 10 mins or so.. which wasn't bad for a Friday around lunchtime. The lady was super apologetic we had to wait and came by to apologize and tell us there were tables still paying/chatting - we appreciated it but we understood and it definitely wasn't their fault! She was so super nice! I enjoyed watching the guys make dumplings and noodles from the window while we sat and waited.  We finally got a table and they took a few mins to grab our order. You get a piece of paper and mark the items based on how many of each dish you want. Super quick, super efficient! I can see how it could be difficult though if you weren't familiar with the dishes cause there were no pictures.    *Xiao Long Bao aka Soup Dumplings - This was one of the dishes I was underwhelmed with. The skin was thick, the dumplings didn't contain very much soup, and the meat flavors were just ok - a bit salty and heavy on the ginger. The sauce was also vinegar or dumpling sauce - usually they give you sliced ginger and you pour vinegar or a sauce over it. 3/5  *Braised Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup - I did like the fresh noodles and the braised beef in this dish. The beef and tendon was tender and the flavors of the broth were spot on. 4/5  *Braised Minced Pork over Rice - This dish was as expected. Flavors were good. Rice and meat ratio was a bit off - too much rice, not enough meat. Enjoyed the egg as well! 4/5  *Hot Spicy Wonton Noodles - Pretty Spicy. Noodles dried up and clumped together if you don't mix it quickly enough. Wontons were ok. 3/5  *Dan Dan Noodles - Not like the traditional Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles. It tasted like a peanut sauce mixed with noodles. 2/5  My problem with all the noodles is that they were the same in every dish. Nothing different but the sauce or broth. To be fair they do give you an option for thick or thin noodles and we should've ordered a mix, but I don't think it would change how I felt about the dishes.   *Baby Bok Choy with Oyster Sauce - as expected but just a bit on the salty side. 3/5  *Crispy Pork Buns - not crispy enough. Meat was good. 3/5  *Green Onion Pancake - I liked the flavors but it was a bit doughy and so needed to be crispier. 4/5  *Sweet Egg Bun - my favorite out of all the dishes we ordered. I loved the salty/sweet egg custard with a soft pillowy bun. 5/5  Overall, just ok.. I wasn't amazed but I would come back for a few certain dishes, especially when it's cold out!",

The soup was a little gamey from the pork and just didn't have that umami soup flavor. That said, the skin was really delicious and it's amazing to watch them make the dumplings and kind of mesmerizing to see an entire, beautiful tray of dumplings. You can ask for ginger and spicy oil which cuts out some of the gaminess.   We also had the dan dan noodles. The noodles were quite good, they had that perfect chewy flavor. It was a little too creamy and peanut-y but overall good.   The other food looked great, especially the scallion pancake beef roll.   They also have a 5% cash discount. The restaurant was very busy around 1 pm on a Saturday but the line moved quite quickly and they were pretty empty by 2 pm.",

I immediately thought this place was so cool because you can watch the experts make dumplings and noodles through big windows. We ordered a variety of different things to try. To start, we ordered the beef tendon, broccoli, veggie dumplings, and pork soup dumplings. Everything came out super hot (and quickly!). At first bite, you could tell everything was made fresh. I also ordered the pork shrimp wonton noodle soup, with wide noodles. Again, it was definitely so fresh. They have a lot of unique items on their menu. I can't wait to come back and try something new!",

    "text": "Stopped by for a late dinner on Friday - the place was packed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for two. The restaurant is tight and tables are packed pretty close together, but the decor is great and the atmosphere is lively, hip, and a little edgy.   Bubble teas are delicious, but definitely sweet and rich enough to serve as dessert, not a beverage. The boba is very sugary and the tea is mixed with pretty heavy milk/cream. Probably the most intensely sweet bubble tea I've ever had. They don't seem to serve hot boba here, either.   I was a little disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options. There are maybe three or four things on the entire menu labeled as vegetarian? Though there are many Noodle soups without meat, they are all served in a chicken/meat broth. Since the only vegetarian noodles were cold sesame, and I really came for some noodle soup, I ended up ordering a dish with fat noodles, mushroom and bamboo and just not drinking the chicken broth. Not ideal, but worth it for the amazing chewy noodles. All the flavors were great, but these noodles obviously make the restaurant a hit.   The portions were huge and we couldn't finish everything. Prices were very affordable, less than $30 for noodles and bubble tea for two people. Though there may be a wait, the food is served at lightening speed - I think we got our noodles in less than ten minutes.   I had a lot of fun eating here and will definitely be back. Looking forward to trying the veggie dumplings.",

Partially chose this place due to the free entertainment of watching the kitchen staff make the noodles- always a bonus when dining with small children.  Arrived a little after 1pm on a weekday and was seated promptly- cute ambiance and friendly service. You check off what you want from the menu and the server reviews it with you prior to submitting ticket to kitchen. We decided (group of 3 adults and 2 kids) to share family style and went with:  Pickled cucumber (really good w a hint of spice!) Pork soup dumplings (delicious) Shrimp,pork,wonton noodle soup (very good - but would ask for a side of spice to make more interesting) Braised beef and tendon noodle soup  Taiwanese pork belly sliders (amazing) Pan fried pork bun (only item we didn't finish) Sweet egg yolk steam buns (wow) As well as taro and Thai iced tea bubble teas  Everything was overall really great- you get a choice of thick or thin noodles in the noodle soups   Only thing missing from the experience was a toddler friendly kids menu (a simple fried chicken item would have been perfect or a basic noodle in a small portion size )  Highly recommended overall!",

Don't be intimidated by the large crowd of people in the doorway - they seat people quickly and the wait time is usually less than estimated  The one downside of the menu is that they only have a few vegetarian options. Nevertheless, the ones they do have are delicious. I usually go with the bamboo and mushroom noodle soup (it's not marked vegetarian so it probably has a meat-based broth or something, but shhhh don't tell me). The vegetarian dumplings are incredible! Be warned, their portions are bigger than the prices suggest  It's hard to beat soft chewy fresh-made noodles, so fresh you can watch them being made!",

The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend who lives in the area. Our seats were right in front of the kitchen, so we had a view of chefs making fresh noodles and dumplings.  Coming from Washington, DC, we were very excited by the prices and ordered entirely too much food. Dishes included soup dumplings, steamed dumplings, two noodle dishes, scallion pancakes, and more. Everything was great. My only complaint is some of the dishes that were marked as spicy did not have as much flavor as I would have liked. The amount of red pepper flakes added really just took away from some of the other flavors I wanted to be there.  Overall, the restaurant had some great food that was served up very quickly, for a great price.",

I recommend trying their noodle dishes especially the dan dan noodles. In addition the pancakes are delicious added with sliced meat. When you come, you will see the workers hand-pulling noodles. These noodles are more chewy and super fresh. They may not be the same size because they are handmade. The service is really great and they are very helpful in recommending what to try.   This is a great place to check out with a group of friends. I will be back!",

Boyfriend and I wanted to try a bunch of things and ended up ordering the  jellyfish salad, pork belly sliders, wonton soup, dan dan noodles, and oxtail noodle soup consume.   - Jellyfish Salad: Nice refreshing dish but it needed a more vinegary taste. Never had my jellyfish salad served under a small bed of lettuce --don't know how I feel about that.  - Pork Belly Sliders: Tasty but overall over priced.   - Wonton Soup: Pretty standard. Weird to see that they put a couple pieces of broccoli in the soup.   - Dan Dan Noodle: Felt like the noodles should have had a thicker texture to help the dish. Flavors were average.  - Oxtail Noodle Soup: I got it with the flour noodles. Nice clear and light broth. Good amounts of oxtail included in the dish which was a plus. Oxtail was fall off the bone tender. Probably one of the better dishes we got.  Overall nothing really stood out in flavor or presentation. Sadly everything just felt lackluster. For a place that makes fresh hand pulled noodles, it was missing the homemade texture. Hard to put my finger on it but the dishes just felt like they were missing something.",

A fun (and reasonably priced) place to try multiple smaller dishes with several friends.  We went on a cold winter day and got their braised beef and tendon soup, mushroom and bamboo soup, pork and vegetable potstickers, vegetable dumplings, and their braised beef and drunken chicken appetizers.  I was unaware that the braised beef and drunken chicken appetizers were served chilled, otherwise I would not have ordered them on such a cold day in the winter - but they were reasonably tasty.  Our favorites of everything were the pork potstickers, which were very flavorful - but eat them when they are hot - the flavor is definitely not as good as they cool down.  Interestingly, mushroom and bamboo soup had a very flavorful broth - deeper flavored than the braised beef.  The bamboo was a purplish color that tasted like it was marinated or pickled in something - very tasty.  Also, the glass container on the table that looks like soy sauce is actually soy sauce mixed with vinegar, and a little sugar, I believe.  Most likely made more as a dipping sauce for the dumplings and potstickers.  That was tasty.  This place is BYOB with a $5 corkage fee.",

I had the Spicy Wonton noodles ( yummy...I eat the wontons then have lunch the next day with noodles). Husband has the minced pork noodles ( also very good).  No soup dumplings this time as we only have so much room ). We did try the Fried Tofu appetizer. Not to my liking....I didn't like the pudding texture of the inside.....thought it would be firmer. Daughter wouldn't even try as its a texture that she can't eat ( no jello or pudding for her either). Crispy sweet buns are the perfect ending...like the best warm doughnut ever!",

I haven't had beef brisket noodle since I was a kid and it's one of my favorite meals, was lucky they serve them here. We also had the bubble tea with pudding crab and regular dumplings and some pancakes rolls. Hand made noodles taste the best~ Will come back again for more gourmet soon~",

I ordered the top three most popular things on the menu: pork soup dumplings, pork belly bun, braised beef noodles. The pork soup dumplings were okay. The pork belly buns were AWFUL, like tasted like a mish-mash of gross shite. And the beef was ok, but the noodles tasted overwhelmingly like dough; totally overpowered the broth and tasted like I was eating raw spaghetti.  Bleh...",

The noodle soup I tried was above average (beef and tendon) and I really liked the chili oil they served it with. Need to come back!  For vegetarians: they have an off-the-menu soup with mushrooms and zucchini and other veggie goodies (my companion loved it).",

The noodles are made freshly in front of you - and you can taste it! I enjoy the beef soup and the pork noodles - the meat quality is not the best I've ever had, but it is always tasty and acceptable for the price. Some of the preparations haven't been my favorite - the Dan Dan noodles were a little too peanuty for my liking- but definitely have had good experiences overall and go back frequently.",

    "text": "This place is a really sweet addition to Pittsburgh's dining options. I thought everything was a cool experience for me because I have honestly never seen anything like this.   Since I'm not very familiar with Chinese food like this I had a ton of questions on exactly what I was ordering. The waitstaff were very helpful and introduced us to some great eats. We ordered Wood Ears & Sliced Tofu kin appetizer which was very tasty and an ample size for two, keep this in mind when ordering that the noodles and dumplings are very large portion sizes so don't order too many appetizers or you will have to bring home food, we did.  As our main dish we tried the Braised Beef Noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles. The Braised Beef Noodles are in a huge bowl of broth with a ton of noodles. I loved the tenderness and subtle flavoring of the beef that was in the soup. The Dan Dan noodles are \"Dry Noodles,\" but don't let that be misleading you still get a hefty bowl of noodles that are coated in a sauce similar to a peanut sauce with a little bit of kick.   I'm a big fan of Bubble Tea, and fortunately it is offered here and have to say that your options to customize your Tea to what you like are available. I have actually never had been offered so many options for my bubble tea.  On another note I wasn't sure if they offer forks for us lazy folks, but I suggest taking your time through your meal and sticking to using the chopsticks. I have never  used chopsticks for noodles and it was certainly an experience but fun and made our lunch stretch out a little longer than normal. But if you want a fork I saw some folks using forks on our way out.  Another cool thing is the dudes cranking out in- house noodles and dumplings,it sort of reminds me of making taffy. You should Check it out!",

With that said, I was disappointed that there was not a large vegetarian menu. I understand that the broths need to be made as they are; however, how hard is it to have a veggie broth hanging in the wings or a quick miso? Regardless, there are a few items that non meat lovers can enjoy and the experience is worth it. Plus, if this town is going to get more restaurants preparing food aside from General Tso's than we all need to support!",

Except for one entre (the minced pork with noodles, word is that it tasted like liver), we were all very happy with our meals. The potstickers were fantastic, and come out all bunched together - they had been taken straight out of the pan. I had the won ton noodles, which were actually spicy! So happy. I tried the cold sesame noodles with chicken that my friend ordered, and I was almost jealous - peanut/lime/noodle/chicken combo was delicious.   Best of all, they make the noodles in front of you! They actually ran out of noodles at one point, so they had two noodle-makers thumping huge ropes of pasta dough on a counter in front of us. Dinner and entertainment, excellent.",

    "text": "Everyday Noodles: Noodles with a \"Show\"  So, confession time... yes, it's True...I have been to Benihana.  You know, one of those ridiculous hibachi establishments where you pay a fortune to witness the \"showmanship\" of some guy throwing a few shrimps at your mouth.  Do yourself a favor; don't go, even if they did send you a \"Free Entree for your Birthday\" coupon.  Instead, head over to Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill.  Here, you can be entertained and eat Taiwanese-style noodles gimmick-free.   When you enter Everyday Noodles, the first thing you notice, besides the aroma of delicious eats, is the row of cooks/chefs stationed behind a large pane of glass.  While being escorted to your table, you're very likely to witness (and be totally mesmerized) with a gentleman who is wielding an enormous stretch of dough.  He'll continuously stretch and pull the dough, making you jump as he slaps it down to the counter from time to time. These cooks are masters at what they do.  Considering the owner, Mike Chen, personally selects cooks from Taipei to visit Pittsburgh to train his employees, it's no shock to see such expertise.

The wonton noodle was an average but their beef soup noodle was a A+ and it is also faster. We will be back to try their steam dumpling.

We thought the food should be good since it is a new place, and I have already heard a lot of people talking about it before I decided to go and try.   Most of the people kind of go there to have the soup dumplings, which made us looking forward a lot to have that. There was a big window at the entrance, in which the chefs were showing how to make noodles. It looks fun and interesting, and which makes the place very \"sexy\".   We ordered jellyfish and beef tender. The half of the dish of the jellyfish was cabbage. I could say the jellyfish I make at home is way much better than that. Then, we tried the soup dumplings. Actually, there is no soup in the dumpling, and the meat in the dumpling is too smashed. I was very disappointed. The taste was only so so.   My friend ordered a Wonton Men. It tasted like only wontons,noodles and oil. The Wonton Men tasted very BLAND, and my friend could not even continue to eat that after her first bite. My boyfriend ordered beef tender noodle, which has the broth came out with it. The broth was okay, but the noodles tasted not like the noodle made by hand. It tasted like INSTANT NOODLE instead.   The service was good though. The owner of the restaurant was very nice. He brought the food out to us and explained everything. The decoration is cool, but the tables and seats are all fixed and settled on the floor. They could not be moved, so it' was very hard for us to sit in.",

It's the sort of menu where you check off your order with a pencil.  Even so, things came out not quite as ordered (shrimp dumplings instead of pork, meat sauce instead of oyster).  But you know what?  It was all delicious so we didn't care.  The five-spice eggplant was particularly good.  We took the micro-managing of our dumplings, by various servers, with a grain of salt. Pittsburgh has been long overdue for a place like this.  Don't miss it.",

The food however is fairly authentic (hand made noodles, soup dumplings, and other snack type of Chinese food). The food is Taiwanese in style although some dishes have a northern China vibe.  - beef noodle soup: good stewed beef, good noodle, soup could've been brothier (just add some juice from the beef stew), I'm also missing pickled veggies Taiwanese style; - soup dumplings: tried the Sunday special seafood ones, very light and delicate tasting, waitress gave us dishes with ginger but no vinegar which is a little odd; - Dan Dan noodle: soupier that what I'm used to, not spicy either, was alright.  Overall a pretty great spot, sorry for being picky, I'm just really Chinese lol.",

I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings and was sorely disappointed, the shrimp tasted like cheap frozen shrimp farmed in ponds dumped with antibiotics and then treated with bleach after.  I also tried some noodle soup and I wanted to like them but the texture and flavor was off-putting to me.  I expected a lot, $10 for eight tiny dumplings that \"tasted\" like i could have gotten them frozen in an asian grocery store somewhere wasn't what I expected.  I have only tried two dishes, take this review with a grain of salt, but I am scared to go back and try anything else because i fear it will be a waste of my money on top of experiencing even more disappointment.",

Part of the experience is looking through the window that lets customers see the food being made, which is cool. But I don't think I really like ramen noodles; they were chewy--which I'm not a fan-- and it didn't have much flavor. Everything else in my (kind of small ~$10) noodle soup bowl was good - bean sprouts, chives, pork, and egg.  We also ordered the pork soup dumplings, which were new to me. I'm glad I put the whole dumpling in my mouth rather than biting it! The burst of soup was a nice and tasty surprise.   Another upside was the taro milk tea which was pretty good for Pittsburgh; it was creamy in the best way. One thing was that I didn't ask for bubbles/boba, I said it was milk tea, not boba--it just came with the drink.  If anything I'd come back for the soup dumplings, not so much the noodle bowls.",

I got one thing of xiao long baos (soup dumplings) and it was $10?  I mean.. lets be real here...  I didn't think it was that flavorful. But I guess for Pittsburgh it's ok.   I also got the scallion pancake and beef thingy..  Not good either. I would rather spend my $20 somewhere else...   The atmosphere is weird.. it's a small place, but you can sit at the \"bar\" and watch the chef's make the dough/noodles...  They slam the dough really hard onto the counter top so if you're sitting at the bar, just be warned that you'll jump every 10 seconds.",

This place gets only 3 stars because the meat could be better and the dishes are only moderately priced.  Friendly and quick service. Very busy even on an early Thursday evening.",

The food is generally OK. I'm very impressed w the beef tendons which are really nicely braised and has a jelly-ish texture. The potsticks are good too especially w the ginger vinegar. But the soup dumplings are a little disappointing. I have anticipating having their dumplings due to what ppl say on Yelp. But they are no better than just mediocre Chinese soup dumplings. Despite juicy and flavorful, the soup inside is  too salty and greasy to be appropriate. And that's the reason why they don't taste good when they are cold. The wonton noodle soup is a mixture of PERFECT noodles, mediocre wontons and salty soup that tastes terribly like chicken powder. The shredded pork over rice is OK but also very salty. Anyway, I highly recommend the nicely stretched noodles here and the potsticks.",

Pork slider was literally one big slider and a little difficult to cut up and split. Dan Dan noodles were wonderfully savory with a hint of spicy. Crispy mini milk buns were perfection.   I wish I could eat here everyday - pun intended. I will definitely be heading back because this place is a gem!!",

If you request the table for 4 at the noodle window, you can even watch while you eat!  The wait time varies depending on when you go.  Around 3pm on a Sunday, the wait time was about 5 minutes.  Our server was friendly and willing to explain foods on the menu and demonstrate the proper way to eat the soup dumplings.  The soup dumplings were excellent!  Served in a bamboo steamer, they made a perfect appetizer for 4, but would also be great alone as a meal for 1!    The pork belly bun was amazing!  Be aware, the meat pieces do have a significant amount of fat on them.  It is for flavor, and you don't have to \"chew the fat\" if you don't want to!    A huge fan of boba tea, their milk tea was exceptional for its size and price. 16 ounces of goodness.  Adding grass jelly was an added bonus!  Also, be aware that the Taiwanese Style Dan Tsu Noodles Soup portion is very large!  It is about 3 times the size of that served in Taiwan.  One bowl is a great size to share with a friend!",

It was neat to watch these guys ply their craft.   I will agree with some other reviewers that I was expecting there to be more noodle options on the menu since they kind of advertise themselves as having noodles, but after getting past that we dove into the menu to see what we could find.    We started with the onion pancake with sliced beef.  This was amazing.  The dough was flaky, the beef was juicy and tender and the vegetables rolled inside created the perfect combination of taste and texture.  Our second starter was the pork and veggie wontons.  These were tasty and I liked the spicy sauce but I'm not a huge fan of pork wontons so these were the least memorable part of the experience.    For main dishes, my wife got the \"dry\" hot spicy wonton noodles and I got the \"Only Sunday Limited\" option of shrimp and loofah soup dumplings.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  I got mine because it was on the menu only once a week and I'm glad I did.  Having never had anything like this before, I ordered blindly but figured if they reserve it for only one day a week, it must be special.  And it was.  The loofah soup went perfect with the shrimp and doughy dumpling.  And with a little bit of freshly sliced ginger, these were absolutely delicious.    Although I am not Chinese and so can't comment on the authenticity or how this compares to other people's preparations, I would defintiely recommend trying this restaurant.",

My friend got the black milk tea, and she said hers was too sweet. Lol maybe they forgot to add sugar in mine but added too much in hers?

    "text": "So we ordered take out from Everyday Noodles to try it for the first time about two weeks ago.  My wife got flour noodles with chicken and I got rice noodles with beef and we had a side of broccoli.  First off, the noodles weren't bad but the chicken was quite greasy and I was surprised it was on the bone with skin...so it was a lot of work to get to the meat.  The big problem was the broccoli.  We were about halfway through our miniature green trees when my wife noticed something - worms!  YUCK!!  Our cruciferous goodness was ruined!  Probably half the broccoli had worms in it.  Extra protein?  Hmmmm, maybe.  But I called the next day to tell them about it and the woman I spoke to apologized and took my number and said a manager would call me back.  No one ever did.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  We won't be going back to Everyday Noodles.",

We ordered beef tendon and the Taiwanese pork slider as appetizers, which were quite good.   Our entrees were Dan Dan noodles, which are slightly spicy, but not overly so; I'm South Asian, but my tolerance for heat is low. The mixture of sweet and spicy flavors is one I've never experienced before, and it was delicious! The wide noodles were amongst the best I've ever had.   Desserts were a red bean with sesame seeds pancake, which was decent but nothing to write home about, and what were essentially milk pastries, which were fresh buns drizzled with a condensed milk sauce... Simple, and tasty.   Pricing is on point for a large city, but struck me as mildly high for the desserts, which were the only parts of the meal that weren't a grand slam. Everything was fresh, and the decor was well done. I'm in the DC area, and really wish there was a solid noodle place of this caliber back home.",

The Pork Potstickers were so moist and flavorful, best dumplings around. This is a staple for us at least once a month. Be aware that when you dine in there is usually a wait on the weekends and the restaurant does tend to get packed in fast. So we tend to go early or go with their quick pick up.  The best part of this place is that everything noodle wise is made in house. You can watch the cooks making the noodles, and when you have them you can really taste the difference. A well priced one of a kind restaurant.",

When I went back again but wanted a carryout meat over rice dish- I got a lot of rice with with barely any meat.  And they sent me off with a one chopstick (my fault for not making sure I had a set).  I need two chopsticks to make chopsticks work.  But I guess there wasn't much food to eat and one chopstick would do, cause I tossed most of the generous rice away. I speared the two pieces of scallop sized meat  with my one chopstick.  After two bites, my 11 dollars meal was all gone (still had a lot of rice left though and of course one marinated egg - which was a regular sized boil egg).  Overall, unlikely to be going back for carryout, maybe to eat in.  But for sure I will not risk another take out overly generous white rice.    Carryout rating - 1 star Eat In rating - 3 stars Average - 2 stars",

I enjoyed the overall dining experience: the big kitchen window showing the Chinese chefs making fresh soup dumplings and noodles (very common feature of noodle places in China), the vinegar and ginger slices as side (again, very Chinese), the Chinese characters of \"noodles\" on the back of their uniforms... The soup dumplings are as authentic as they can get in the States. I also had the pickled cucumber cubes and the wonton in chili oil (Hong You Chao Shou). Both were decent but a little too plain for my taste - after all, both are iconic Sichuan dishes. The chili oil lacks complexity in flavor. The authentic Sichuan chili oil is made with not only chili peppers but also all sorts of spices and herbs, which was absent in their version.",

Yum again.  Finally we get the thin Dan Dan noodles. Hella good. Pretty much everything we try is good. These are our favorites.  The staff are always welcoming and friendly. It's a busy place and the tables are pretty close together. It's not a fancy place but it's comfy.   This place is in a little shopping area with locally owned businesses.

GEE. They were amazing. Delicious is not even a word that I can use to describe them, because it's not enough. The broth inside was so flavorful. These are a must-get if you are visiting.  We also ordered Dan Dan Noodles Szechuan Style ($7) and the Hot Spicy Wonton dry noodles ($7). They were both really good, but the Hot Spicy Wonton was definitely my fave. We ordered wide noodles with both of them and I'm glad we did. The noodles were the perfect amount of chewy!  One thing to note about the Dan Dan - it's SUPER peanutty which is a-ok in my book, but it can be overwhelming after a whole dish of them so bear that in mind as you make your choices.  I also had a cup of the green tea, which was perfect as it's a super chilly day out.  All in all, the whole meal ran us under $30 and was so satisfying. I cannot wait to go back!",

I always try to get the table across the glass window through which I can watch them prepare noodles and dumplings. However, there will be periodic \"thud...thud...thud...thud....\" sound when they knead the dough before stretching it to make the noodles.   The only meat I eat is chicken. So, there are not many options for me on the menu. I usually get the veggie noodles and  dumplings. Though the options are limited, I still go there for two reasons. One reason is the fresh and subtle flavours of the noodles and the delicious broth. Secondly, for the best dumplings I ever had.",

I ordered a minced pork noodle (they are hand drawn at the restaurant and you can watch them!) which was very delicious. The portions are average in size and were on the more expensive side. We also had pork soup dumplings, which were steamed very well. The service was average, but the food was served within minutes! I would recommend this place for anyone who likes noodles and bubble tea too. Blessings!",

We visited this place on our recent trip to Pittsburgh and one day was not enough for us to savor these amazing dim sums. We came back the second day as well to get some more dim sums. The Pork Soup Dumplings are heavenly. You can simply get these and feel lucky you came to this place. They make it right in front of you and you will be amazed at the amount of dumplings they can get done in 15-20 mins.   Also, the Braised Pork Belly over Rice and Lamb Noodle Soup Consomme was very tasty too! We also tried the Pan Fried Pork Bun which was very nice - it is different than the traditional BBQ Pork Buns who may have had at other places but it is quite good. We also got the Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake which was okay. You can also get Bubble Tea at this place which I believe is a bonus. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Very highly recommend this place to all dim sum lovers. Enjoy!",

I typically get the hot and spicy wonton noodles or Dan Dan noodles. Today, I ordered the Shrimp, Pork, Vegetable Wontons and was not disappointed. It was fairly spicy but the flavors are authentic and, as with all other items on the menu, the handmade noodles are a wonderful touch. The waiting times on weekends tend to be a little longer but when I went on Thursday night, I was immediately seated and received my food quite promptly. If I had to eat these noodles everyday I would not be mad.",

I also love that part of the kitchen can be seen through the window where you can watch the chefs make dumplings. In fact, you can choose to sit at a table that is right in front of the window. So dinner and a show?  Food: the food was around $10 so it's pretty reasonable. I got some Taiwanese Style Dan Tsu noodles and shared pork soup  dumplings with my friend. The noodles I got was good, though I think the other choices with more meat would be better so I plan on trying that next time. I thought everything tasted authentic though. Particularly after a string of bad restaurants I went to in Pittsburgh, I was pleasantly surprised by Everyday Noodles.   Overall, Everyday Noodles has nice decor, decently delicious and authentic food, and fairly cheap prices. Warrants a 4 star in my book. I would come back!",

I will say, I should have read the reviews before I went the first time - I would have gotten the soup dumpling then!    My first visit we got WAY too much food for 2 people, but we also didn't know what to expect.  We got a side of veggies, 2 dry noodle choices, a dim sum pork belly, and an order of some dumplings.  OBVIOUSLY way too much food for 2 people - but we sure did give it an honest effort.  With the inexpensive pricing, we expected small portions.  Little did we know!  However, it made fantastic leftovers!  They did bring food out as it was ready - so we got it in an interesting order.  But no complaints here!  We also had the best seats in the house - right where they were making noodles in front of us.  I was in awe the whole time watching the process.    My second visit...THIS was Soup Dumpling time.  My friend had never been there, and again, we got the best seats in the house!  I was bummed though, as they must have been done making noodles for the day.  My friend and I were unsure how to eat them, so our waiter was kind enough to show us (without making us feel like idiots).  This time - we didn't go crazy with the food.  We each got a dry noodle dish, soup dumplings and something else small that we shared.  It was pure perfection.    The staff, the food, the atmosphere - all were perfection.  I am looking forward to going back - MANY MANY many times.  (I've already got a couple times with friends planned!)",

It had a nice atmosphere and they have it set-up where you can watch the chefs crank out the noodles. We ordered the soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, and a pork belly 'slider'. I put Slider in quotes because the thing was quite massive...even between us two it was a struggle to eat it, but it was very good, as well as the pork buns. My only gripe was the soup dumplings were a bit of a letdown. While I though the texture and meat were nice, the broth was not good, at times tasting like dirty meat water or something.. (Don't ask me how I would even know what that tastes like) I was expected much more from the dumplings, and was a bit let down. Overall I still enjoyed coming here, and I think i would give them another chance if given the opportunity",

It was a pretty cool thing.   They didn't have a huge selection in terms of options, but I could've just eaten the pork soup dumplings and I would've been a happy camper. The only slightly negative thing I would say was that once the waiter came over it was far and few between to see him again. It also took a long time for them to drop our check.

It's great fun to see the cooks creating the noodles - even though I jumped a few times from all the loud pounding.  Kinda surprised that there are no savory bun options on the dim sum menu (I'd love to see some in the future).  But, what they do offer is delectable.  Definitely try the soup dumplings!  If you've never had them, make sure to ask your waitress how to eat them.  It's also wonderful to find a place that serves varieties of bubble milk tea with your food (though I hope to see fruit bubble teas and ice blended versions eventually).    This restaurant would be getting 5 stars, except the prices are pretty hefty.  It's understandable, what with the location and lack of competition.  However, most items are $2-$3 more than you'd pay at any other noodle house in Philly or NYC.  We might all be paying for the \"noodle show\", which I can understand.  Also, some people mention huge portions; We didn't experience that.  Still, the quality is certainly there!",

On my first visit, I ordered the dry Dan-Dan noodles, as well as an appetizer of the wood ears and tofu skins to share.  In that appetizer, I enjoyed the tofu skins much more than the wood ears, which surprised me since I'm not a tofu aficionado, but I think it was due to the unique texture (thin and rolled up).  The Dan Dan noodles were okay, but their flavor became a bit monotonous after a bit--the dish could use some variety in flavor.  It's very filling, however, since it's huge; I was only able to eat half, and took the other half home for later consumption (the flavor was just as monotonous the next day).  The second time, I ordered the pork and crab meat soup dumplings, per a friend's recommendation.  They were much better than the Dan Dan noodles.  They're little pouches filled with soup, pork, and crab meat.  When I ate them, I felt like they bursted in my mouth with warmth and flavor!  The filling was a bit on the salty side, but was otherwise delicious.  I also ordered the sliced seaweed w/ garlic appetizer, which wasn't very memorable.  My dining partner ordered the Dan Dan noodles, and ended up leaving half of them on his plate when we left, so I guess I'm not the only one who's less-than-enthusiastic about this dish (also, see other reviews).  The ambience is interesting--there's always a guy in the front making the noodles, and it's fun to see how they're made.  You order by filling out a slip indicating your selections.  Service has always been fine.",

There was enough soup in the gigantic bowl for three people, too, and the prices are very modest indeed, so it's a fantastic value.    I will definitely return to sample other things on the menu.  It's very telling that the place was packed with Asian people, several of whom were kind enough to point out what they were eating when I asked.",

    "text": "I have stopped by here twice now, most recently this afternoon with my father for lunch.  The inside of this restaurant is modern and clean with some nice soothing colors.  My favorite part of the restaurant is the big clear window that allows you to see the chef making the fresh noodles and the tables in front of it which position you for the perfect view of it.  For my lunch entree, I decided to go with the pickled mustard green with pork noodle soup while my father went with the chicken noodle soup.  We both chose to have our soup with thin flour noodles when given the option between rice noodles and thick or thin flour noodles.  Besides the soups we also decided to go with a dry noodle and decided to split the hot and spicy wonton noodles which I had on my first visit.  The hot and spicy wonton noodles came out first and was a bowl of noodles topped with six wontons and a spicy sauce.  The noodles had a springy texture and were nice to eat while the wontons tasted nicely as well.  While both of those components were good I think that the spicy sauce really made the dish.  As my dad said, \"the more that I eat of the dish, the spicier it gets\"  which I agreed with and loved.  After we were finished with the dry noodles our noodle soups came out next.  The bowls are quite large and could easily be a meal themselves.  The broth of mine had a good flavor and while the pork didn't do too much for me, I loved the sourness of the pickled mustard greens.  Whenever I got some I felt like it balanced out the soup perfectly.  Much like the dry noodles I thought that the noodles of my soup had some great texture with a bit of springiness.  My dad was also happy with his soup of which the protein consisted of four pieces of skin on-bone in chicken which he thought was flavorful.  The bottom line for me is that we will definitely be back here again in the future.  I love that this place has great flavors and is reasonably priced and I could see it being the perfect dining spot on a cold Pittsburgh day.",

    "text": "I really want to love this place, but it's just not happening. There are many good things about this place; the service, the atmosphere, the hand-pulled noodles, but the quality of the dishes really ruin it for me.  We went in to place an order for takeout. We grabbed a menu on the way in and waited at the counter. There was a good variety of dishes on the menu including dumplings, soup, and dry noodles, basically what you would expect from a noodle place. The people behind the register were very friendly and ordering was a smooth process.  We did not stay and eat inside, but the place looked beautiful. Nicely laid out, very modern design and decor, and you could see everything that was happening in the kitchen through the glass divider separating it from the dining area. It was pretty busy inside, but did not feel overcrowded. They had just reopened for dinner and it was already packed inside, so I think calling ahead of time would be a good choice if you plan on getting a table.  I ordered the Braised Beef Noodle Soup (my usual go-to for noodle soups) and my partner ordered the Oxtail Noodle Soup. Each were $11. We also got an order of the Pork Soup Dumplings for $9, which was a lot more than I wanted to spend. We sat outside at the tables and chairs in front of the place and about 10 minutes later we were given our food.  We got home quickly and got everything ready to eat. The noodles and broth came in separate containers so the noodles don't get soft and mushy before you get a chance to eat.  Here is what I enjoyed: the noodles.  The noodles were very delicious and fresh tasting. They were done very well and I loved them. I've had other noodles that compare to these, but they still stand out on the top of my list.  Here is what I did not enjoy: everything else.  Both broths were very bland. I thought the oxtail broth tasted better than the braised beef, because it had that meaty/boney flavor, but it still wasn't anything special. It was almost like sipping water that had a very, very light beef flavor to it. We had to add a ton of soy sauce and salt just to add any sort of taste to it.  The braised beef that was included in my soup was fatty and hard to eat. I feel like the meat was there just for looks, because it added nothing in terms of flavor to the soup and was next to impossible to chew and swallow.  The dumplings were the worst. The portion was rather small for the price, which I have already griped about above, and the flavor was terrible. The dumplings were very moist turning the insides into a gross, pork puree. I've had dumplings at other places and have made my own many times and I have never eaten a batch quite like this. Of the 8 dumplings, we ate 3 before giving up.  So for $30+ we had two orders of good noodles soaking in near tasteless broth full of fatty inedible pieces of meat and a side of unenjoyable dumplings.  I feel like our meal was not worth the money we paid at all. If our bill was half of what we actually paid, I would suck it up and say, \"hey, it wasn't that bad considering the price\", but I really expected a lot more from this.  I don't think I'll give this place another try any time soon as I was very disappointed. It's just another notch in my belt on my search for good noodles and dumplings in Pittsburgh.",

I've had good, I've had bad, and I've had amazing. These ones are incredible.   5 of us ordered 3 orders of pork soup dumplings, and 2 ordered of crispy mini milk buns. The wait time for the food was practically non-existent. The piping hot dumplings were delivered to our table in no time. The soup inside were delicious, but these were a little delicate. The addition of the chili oil was the icing on the cake. They were perfect, and I had 5 to myself.   The crispy mini milk buns were also delicious. They were brought over just as we were finishing our soup dumplings. They were hot and fresh. Eat bite was crispy, sweet, and just heavenly.   This place is a serious dim sum contender and everyone should come here and order the entire menu.",

This is the closest restaurant to me (Clevelander) that serves authentic, fresh soup dumplings (xiao long bao). The pork soup dumplings are divine, and a must-order if you are planning to stop at this restaurant. Granted, the soup dumplings are not as good as the ones you can get in New York or California, but they are still extremely high quality, made fresh daily. Everyday Noodles also has some nice bubble tea, but not too different from other boba places in the area. The rest of the menu, imo, is not too different from other Taiwanese restaurants in the area. It's definitely the xiao long bao that make this place stand out, and the major reason I have to come here on my Pittsburgh trips.",

I usually go to sun penang for dim sum but love soup dumplings, something that my place doesn't have.   Service was fast and friendly. The owner always came over to joke around with us. The waitress was fast and I like the sheet you fill out with a pencil.   I also thought it was cool you could see the cook staff through the window making noodles and wontons. They wear funny masks which I assume is so they don't cough or sneeze on your food. Looks kinda dorky and the running joke was that we were the first people to breathe on our food.   The food itself was alright. Pot stickers were my favorite. The watercress was good although I think they fried it instead of steaming it which was different.   The soup dumplings loofah were delicious. I really liked how perfectly they came out.   I'm a little torn because the minced pork thin noodles and the ox tail soup were kind of bland. Nothing really screamed delicious. You could actually taste the flower which was pretty good but the broth/sauce left more to desire.   I'd definitely come back again but stay away from the noodles dishes and get more appetizers/dim sum. Kind of defeats the purpose of calling your restaurant everyday noodles when your side dishes are better than the main meal!!",

We had soup dumplings, broccoli, potstickers, hot spicy wonton noodles, and braised beef noodle soup. We could eat those soup dumplings, broccoli, and potstickers all day long! Delicious. I had the spicy wonton noodles, and they were a high but manageable spice level. They're advertised as dry, which means they don't have a sauce component. That was fine, and the texture was great. I will try something else next time, though. My husband had the braised beef noodle soup and loved it. It has a strong Chinese five spice background, so don't get it if that's not for you. Looking forward to our next visit to try more!",

They do have a couple long tables similar to bar seating, which is where we ate.   Unsure of what to try we decided to order several dishes and share. The server asked our likes and wants followed by several recommendations of her popular dishes and favorites.  We choose a spicy dumpling and noodle dish, soup dumplings, and pan fried dumplings.  This would have been plenty for two but we also went with the eggplant appetizer  (served cold). The food came out in waves, quickly and hot. The soup dumplings are a must try and carried the best flavor. I'd prefer some additional dipping sauces outside of the ginger and dumpling sauce they provide.   The restaurant also offers delivery and pick up. No alcohol on site but the table behind us had a bottle of wine so I assume they're BYOB. I would recommend a reservation,  but table turnover seems quick so wait time shouldn't be too long. There are lots of other shops in the area so if you can get a seat, I'd give it a shot. Quick and delicious Asian cuisine at a very reasonable price.",

We were there late on a Sunday night so we didn't get to see the noodle-making in action, but I would imagine that it's pretty cool to watch.  The staff were very friendly and everything was well-priced.  The only negative thing I could say about Everyday Noodles is that while it's beautifully decorated and has a great atmosphere, it's not really a place where I'd feel comfortable lingering over a dinner or on a romantic date - the vibe is more \"in and out\" even though you're sitting down.

I'm super glad that Pittsburgh is expanding it's Asian food scene...and a legit one at that.   The honorable mention: baby bok choy (a tad over cooked, but still delicious), shrimp pot stickers.  The noodles- we tried the dan dan noodles, and easily one of the worst representations of its kind.. no joke. Sauce was not tasty and the texture of noodles was a disappointment, especially considering that it's their specialty.  Service is fast, but friendly. Space is small and it's meant to fit as much people  as it can. Table are meant to be shared with other parties (the bar-ish seating in front of the open air kitchen), and conversations will not be private. This is just a simple place to enjoy some great dumplings.",

The Decor was nice inside and it seemed a bit busy. Our food did come out in bits and pieces, though we all shared, overall I was not too impressed with the taste, we had a cold noodle chicken dish, lamb & noodles, chicken & noodles.. maybe I had high expectations... a plus is that they have bubble tea, the price was ok, maybe a little high but ok, I'd recommend to go once, but not sure if I'd care to return again.",

Nice array of seats: 2-top table-booths with a solo counter and larger parties near the back, bright gold / bamboo vibe helped by bright wood floors. A Healthy mix of white and Asian guests in the generally-white sq hill neighborhood.  Service is fast after filling out the card. Tendon arrived in 3 minutes and noodles another 4. Dumplings were after a out 12 minutes.   Tendon - rich, beefy stock, onions small and needing more salt. Very large plate, gonna be filling. Inconsistent texture.. Some wonderfully crunchy, some so mushy its beef-stock marinated pearl onions.  Dan Dan noodles sat for 2 minutes upon arrival and were mushy by then. Super rich with an extremely heavy peanut flavor, thick and creamy texture helping overwhelm, some sirachra spice and roasted garlic peaking through from time-time. Some aromatic vinegar and brown sugar-molasses as well. Overall its an intoxicating, overwhelming experience and acid / crunch are needed desperately.  Soup dumplings - pretty much perfect. Lightly oily, great texture, juicy as hell with enough salt. The shredded ginger provides the acid.  Ate 2/3 of the tendon, half the noodles, and all 8 dumplings. Was stuffed. Had to box my own to-go. :(  Will make many more trips for the dumplings, might try other stuff. In, out, all business.",

I haven't tried all of their noodle soups but most of them are good and worth trying. I like to get the OX TAIL CONSUME and WONTON NOODLE SOUP.  their service is fairly quick & friendly. as expected from asian restaurants they give you the check while you're still eating but don't take that as a rude gesture. and your food comes out way faster than you'd expect!  the interior is pretty crowded as you can tell that they tried to put as many seats as possible in a small space. that said, plan in advance when to come since their wait during meal times are pretty long. they have a window for customers to watch the chefs make hand-pulled noodles and soup dumplings, it's very entertaining!   tldr; food 4.5/5 service 5/5 interior 4.5/5 timeliness 5/5",

I live 45 minutes away from this restaurant but have gone back to it time and time again since I discovered it last fall, and the food is perfect every time. The Sichuan style dan dan noodles are out of this world delicious. The wonton noodle soup is also not to be missed. The crowning achievement for Everyday Noodles, however, are their pork soup dumplings, which are the singular best thing on the menu. My friend always gets the pork belly over rice, which is very good as well. I often go for my usual, but I haven't tried a thing on this menu I haven't liked. It's always very clean and the staff is always very friendly, but if you go at peak times, be prepared to wait. It's a small restaurant and it's always crowded. But good things come to those who wait. And to those that drive a little further out of their way.",

It hit the spot!  Watching the kitchen magically turn dough into noodles and stuffed dumplings was an additional treat. Unlike Nyc, this restaurant offers a tasty meal that is affordable. The main attraction, though, was how friendly the staff and owner were. Mike Chan is a restaurant visionary who is humble and kind. In summary, if you live in Pitt, it would be wise to make this rest your \"go too\". If you are visiting, hitting up this place will be well with it.",

A little bit small on the meat side, but the taste of the meal was great. My favorite part of noodle soups is always the boiled egg, and the flavor was completely soaked into the egg. Also got a taro bubble tea, and it was a huge portion! A little sweet, but overall tasty. I would highly recommend for authentic noodles!",

I literally contemplate driving all the way out to Squirrel Hill from the North Hills every time I crave them... and usually cave.   I also love the Braised Beef Noodle Soup. It's spicy and it is good, really good. The braised beef is super tender and just falls apart with chopsticks, the vegetables in the soup are cooked to perfection and not soggy and the broth itself really packs a punch. It clears your sinuses out, for sure.   There are bar-style seats near the kitchen and you can see the chefs prepare the noodles, which come either flat or round. It's neat seeing how authentic it is and how much time and effort they put into the meals!  If you're out in the Squirrel Hill area, you've got to check this place out. Get a bubble tea with your meal to get the full experience!",

As for my rice dish, I wasn't too big of a fan. Initially I wanted to order the soup noodle version but decided against it since I was doing take out. The rice was dry and there was more rice than meat. My least favorite dish were the dumplings. I'm used to dumplings shaped like dumplings but these looked like they were melted.

The food is good and the place has a lot to offer, but somehow it always just seems a little off - hence the middle of the road review.    The biggest problem is that the pace of service is consistently a little awkward.  You order all at once on a paper card and then food just starts coming.   There appears to be no rhyme or reason to which dishes come out when - it's just whenever each dish is ready.   So you end up with a random collection of plates and not a lot of room to arrange them on the table - and the order never really makes sense.  You almost have to family style it - otherwise, you might be done before your companions get any of their selections.    The house made noodles are good and it is fun to watch them pull the dough, but you can't actually see it from most of the seats in the house.  I like the BYOB and typically choose dim sum over noodle bowls just to get a little variety.  Their dumplings are fresh and flavorful. If you can get over the randomness of the service, you'll enjoy the food.",

    "text": "TLDR: great noodle soups at fair price points. Service is good, ambiance is great. Highly recommend Taiwanese beef noodle soup for an authentic taste of Taiwanese cuisine, otherwise chicken noodle soup is a great choice.  I often come to Everyday Noodles for the noodle soups, which I personally think are better prepared and more value than their other noodle dishes. I ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup with thin noodles (not the American dish) and was once again served the familiar, flavorful noodles in their light but umami-ful chicken broth. I would however, caution against their  (soup dumplings) as I haven't had too many good experiences with it - usually due to a lack of soup or the skin being too thick.  The service and ambiance are A-tier. I would recommend sitting in front of the kitchen to see the masters at work.",

    "text": "If you want breakfast food, go to Eggyday Noodles.To dine by the river, I recommend Estuary Noodles. And if you wanna see a stage production about how the nation is being lied to and manipulated, try Edgyplay Noodles. If you want a place to pull your Greyhound Bus into at the terminal, try Emptybay Noodles. And if you are feeling horny, try Entryway Noodles. But this is none of these.  What to get: Mango Milk Tea w/ Pudding and Lychee Jelly. What not to get: A drink much better than your friend's because it might make them jelly. What else: Where did that cute Mango?  How to improve: Offer small sizes in bubble teas, and make them a slightly better product.  Erryday Noodles is not the kind of place I'd come erryday, especially not for Bubble Tea because, well, I don't want my stomach to be the size of Pittsburgh. I have yet to try their food but one of these days, I shall.  At first I was going to give them 5 stars for bubble tea, but over the year or two since I first tried it, I've had a thousand bubble teas and my taste has become somewhat more refined. All I can say now is that it's good, but not amazing. I'd put several (including Love Yogurt, I-Tea and Sumi's) significantly ahead of it in the Burgh Bubble Battles.  Speaking of Bubbles, the tapioca itself in here is a bit rubber and tasteless even though the drinks are pretty good. Milk tea is average but some of the other products taste better, such as Mango Milk with Pudding and Lychee Jelly. I do like the prices, which are larger than anywhere in the area, and for less money. I also love the service at EN, which is always friendly, prompt, and courteous.   And if you just came here for a cup of tea, don't bother. You should have gone to Earlgrey Noodles.",

Walking into the shop reminded me of hip, clean, and comforting places in Japan and Korea.  The friendly staff quickly came over greeting us and getting our drink orders.  As per the norm I went with hot tea and water.  The jasmine tea is served in the newer cheesecloth tea bag and is very good.  The food though is why many of you are reading this review and here goes: We shared the potstickers which were legit.  No frozen dumplings steamed in a microwave.  These were hand made then straight up stuck to an earthen pot and steamed traditionally so that you get the crispy starch strewn between each delicious dumpling.  If that wasn't enough I had a hankering for some broth.  I ordered the braised beef & tendon noodle soup with the wide flat noodles.  The broth was rich yet clean, full of flavor and balance.  The handmade noodles had the perfect chew and the portion was too much (not a complaint).  You then must know that the meat was plentiful and flavorful.  Thin slices of beef and chewy chunks of satisfying tendons floated in the amazing broth.  Prices are right too.",

Beef noodle soup was decent 4/5 star Fried tofu was a surprise because it's not greasy and it's egg tofu!  We ordered red bean pancake for dessert and it was 5 star!!

We were a group of four.  We got six plates for the four of us. We got the drunken chicken, the pork soup dumplings, vegetable pork potstickers, and pork belly bun as appetizers. The drunken chicken was unexpectedly cold. The pork belly bun was so so delicious! It's pork belly after all. I found the potstickers a little too greasy. The soup dumplings are a must try - I have no idea how they make those things. The dumplings are so juicy that they just call them soup dumplings.  Besides the dim sum, we got the shrimp pork wonton noodle soup and the hot and spicy wonton noodle. The noodle soup was really bland compared to the spicy noodle. I would highly recommend the latter.  Three among us got Thai iced teas, with different toppings. Unfortunately they were out of tapioca bubbles. I found the coconut topping better than grass and Mango pudding.",

They swing around an enormous rope of dough and bang it on a counter which is a bit loud and surprising, but adds to the charm of the place.   The soup dumplings are good - I had them a few times in China and these are very similar in quality and flavor.

We ordered all the good stuff: xiaolongbao, beef wrap, noodle soups (zha jiang mien and beef noodles and oxtail) and it was totally worth it to wait a bit to eat here. We relished it and I wouldn't mind coming back.",

Some of the dim sum options are a little inconsistent (sometimes skin is a little thick, inconsistent fillings). But for the price point and taste it's a great place to get your fix of noodles! Also despite being a noodle place, their bubble tea is one of the better options in the area.",

    "text": "My go-to place for dimsum whenever I'm back in the Burgh. The XiaoLongBao (little dumplings with soup in them) are absolutely AMAZING. As good as it gets. You really can't go wrong ordering any of the dumplings or buns. I also like their dry noodles a lot (DanDan, Sesame, etc.). Great texture - just chewy enough! The flavoring is also spot on.  While the restaurant is quite small and always packed (it's that popular), I love that they allow you to watch the chefs make noodles. If you've never seen this before, I highly encourage you to go to Everyday Noodles to check it out. It really makes you appreciate the craftsmanship that goes behind the noodles in your bowl.",

If they would expand to Cincinnati I would be a happy camper and probably visit weekly for the xiaolongbao alone.     I was a little less impressed with some of the other menu offerings: seaweed wasn't good, the boba milk tea tasted off (both the milk and the tea were off) and the soup I tried was not memorable.  But that is easily forgiven - if you come here for the soup dumplings you will not be disappointed!",

Staff is really  nice and welcoming, but from there it unfortunately went downwards for me.  I had the shrimp and pork wonton soup and I was quite disappointed. The wontons itself were nice, but the soup just bland. The only thing that gave it some flavor was pepper. I like the fact that the noodles are made freshly on site and you can even watch the chefs preparing them. But for me this just didn't do the trick. It tasted like wontons in hot water with a bit of pepper and 2 small pieces of broccoli that were still raw. I don't know. Maybe I am spoiled from NY and many other places were the broth is just nice and rich, with plenty of veggies and fresh spices. Maybe their specialty are the wontons and dumplings. I would give them another try for the dumplings, but don't expect me to come back soon!",

The soup was average. The beef noodles were slightly spicy, taste was okay, but nothing special.   Shared a pan fried pork dumpling and BBQ pork bun with my boyfriend. Don't even bother with the pork dumpling. But the bun was recommendable.   My boyfriend had a dandan noodle. Nothing special about that too. It was underwhelming.  The milk tea did not taste like actual milk tea you'd get from Asia. I had high hopes for the milk tea because the people working there sounded Taiwanese. So I was hoping for some authentic Taiwanese milk tea. It tasted like every other westernised milk tea in all the other Chinese restaurants.   All in all, over priced Chinese food that really isn't that great. But that's pretty much what you can get in Pittsburgh.",

I've come here multiple times now and have tried the following: beef and tendon noodle soup, pork belly slider, soup dumplings, pork belly and rice, various dry noodles, and scallion pancake.  My main complaint is that the noodle soup was really salty each time I tried it. I thought the first time might have been a fluke but it doesn't seem to have been the case. I'm generally someone who likes my food on the salty side and even this was too salty for me.  The pork belly slider was okay but next time, I would probably order it without peanuts, as I didn't like how the texture went with the rest of the slider.  The soup dumplings were good, and I really liked the scallion pancake. I'll definitely order the scallion pancake if I come here again - they're crispier and thicker (with more layers) than most places make them.",

Had there been more of us, I'd have ordered more of the smaller stuff but I guess I will have to save those for a future visit.   The food came out quickly and it was all very good. The skins of the XLB were just right -- not too thick or too thin so that they break and you lose the precious liquid gold, I mean, soup.   The lamb noodles in consomme needed some extra kick - so you do have to ask for chili oil as it is not readily accessible on the table.   All in all, a True gem in Pittsburgh land.

The loofah and shrimp one wins hands down for me and they're apparently only available on Sundays. We also got the pork belly sliders...delicious but huge portions which is great.

    "text": "With such predominantly good reviews I tried to keep my expectations low so I wouldn't be disappointed. I went with three friends a bit after noon on a nice Saturday when it was in the low 80's outside. The place was packed and we were told the wait would be around 20 minutes. I am uncomfortable standing for long periods of time, and that makes me cranky, but is also not the fault of the restaurant. After reading reviews I was expecting a wait.  It may have been a bit longer than 20 minutes, but not unreasonably so. I dislike crowded places and commented to my friends that unless the food was awesome, I could only foresee coming back for takeout.  Within minutes of being seated and before we could place our order, the power went out... (entire block, not just an internal problem).  Long story short, the entire staff epitomized grace under pressure. We were told what to expect and that the temperature might start to get uncomfortable with no AC and the kitchen continuing to cook with gas, and that our dishes would be served as soon as completed, perhaps one at a time, so they would be fresh and hot. The food was all delicious, our server and hostess were phenomenal, and this turned out to be one of the best dining experiences in a while. I had the rolled scallion pancakes with sliced beef that had such a tasty sauce, and the pork soup noodles. Also sampled the crab and pork soup noodles and veggie soup noodles. All good. My friends, all much less grumpy people than I am, were also very pleased with their meals and we were all wowed by the service. We'll be back!",

We actually had to wait to get a table, but it was a rather short wait of about 5 to 10 minutes as we were told that we would have to wait 20 min or so.   This place has a great ambiance. I love the asian theme and the fact that you can see the cooks stretch out dough to make noodles behind a glass. Pretty cool. They actually have a bar set up right in front so you can see all the action in the kitchen.   The waiters were really knowledgable and had good suggestions for Every Day Noodle virgins like us.  We ended up ordering the shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots as apetizers and boy were they good. I really loved the sauce they were in and just how beefy the flavor was. One thing that did surprise me was that this was a cold dish, but a pretty awesome one even if the temperature was unexpected.   I ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings. Now I was actually expecting a soup with dumplings in it, but to my surprise (once more) it was dumplings with soup inside of them!! The waitress was kind enough to educate me on how to eat this dish. She recommended I pick up the dumpling with tongs, place it on my spoon and pinch it to release the soup. Along side the dumplings, came a sauce that looked like soy sauce as well as some shredded ginger. The server recommended i place some ginger in the sauce and place it on atop the dumplings. She then suggested I sip the soup from the spoon and proceed to eat the rest.  Even though eating this dish was a little different, it was so worth it!! The broth was delightful and the dumplings with the pork and crab was just divine. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, although I was glad to have an appetizer as this dish alone as an entree would not be enough to fill me up.  My husband had the braised beef and tendon soup, which was extremely tasty. The broth in this soup was also incredibly good and the tendons and beef in the soup were oh so tender and tasty!! This dish, although unorthodox for most people, was pretty damn good. This dish was definetely filling, and I had a bit of this dish as I was a little hungry after having my soup dumplings.  Overall, our whole experience was extremely positive and look forward to returning. Everything that we tried was excellent and the customer service was pretty good and efficient. Definitely a good place to hit up for a cold night.",

    "text": "The noodles here are top-notch. Very fresh! You're able to watch them make noodles through the glass they have installed so you can watch while you wait to be seated. The look of the restaurant is quite nice...well-lit, clean, and modern looking.  However, I have 2 very big qualms with this establishment: their lack of flexibility in food options. I do not eat pork for cultural reasons and when I asked to substitute the wontons in one of the dishes from shrimp and pork to just vegetables the waitress said they can't do that. I do not understand why, they're already making vegetable wontons, why not throw those in?!  Regardless, what I ended up ordering was...okay. I ordered the Taiwanese Style Sesame Cold Noodles with chicken tossed in a peanut vinegar sauce, which tasted fresh and crisp up top with the chicken however, as I worked through the dish it began to taste very vinegary and at one point like straight up peanut butter.   Another problem I have with this establishment is that they do not label well. The first time I came here I ordered the Shiitake Mushroom and Bamboo Shoot noodle soup, thinking it was the only vegetarian soup option. While it tasted great, I found out this past visit that the soup is PORK BASED. I could not believe something like that wasn't labeled on the menu! Vegetarians be wary coming here, please be sure to ask you waiter/waitress if there is any meat-based stock or any meat in the food you wish to order. Especially because there are no substitutions!  Bottom Line: If you're a meat eater, I bet this will please your taste buds, as for people who have dietary restrictions or are vegetarians, be careful! Prices are beyond fair, super cheap for a good deal of food.",

Given the positive vibes on this site, we figured it was very much time to dive headfirst into this experience...  Owner was on-site today, and despite my feelings about Tamari, this place gave us the exact opposite experience - excellent service, excellent and inspired food, and overall a great quick Sunday family meal.  We really enjoyed watching the guys make dumplings and noodles; the open kitchen concept really highlights the culinary virtuosity these guys bring to this place.  Our selections really were mostly \"dim sum\" type things - pork soup dumplings, shrimp with loofah soup dumplings, pork pot stickers, a pan-fried scallion pancake, and an order of cold sesame noodles - for the 2.5 of us (little one was in-tow today...) I was truly taken aback to see how much food that got us (Yes, Rachel C., you hit the nail on the head - we have lots of delicious leftovers now!). All for around $40!  Great service - our waiter was efficient and friendly, and even brought out utensils and a bowl for our little one, without us having to ask!   Yes, yes, yes... we will be back! (Very soon, I think!) Looking forward to trying other dishes from this rather large and interesting menu!",

The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more.  I like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish. Dan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me. The noodle with wonton is flavorless to me.  The soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it. I'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.  The appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...  The owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners.",

So far, this is the best place that I have found to eat taiwanese style noodles and xiao long baos!  It is more expensive than in other cities, which have an abundance of these type of restaurants, but it's worth it.  I'd recommend ordering:  *Beef Noodle Soup *Xiao Long Bao's *Beef Rolls (my favvvvvvvv choice at these types of restaurants, although again, the portion is pretty small at Everyday Noodle) *Zha Jiang mian  Usually I like thick noodles, but I think I prefer the thin noodles at Everyday Noodle.

Pork soup dumplings is a MUST order, I took all my friends who aren't used to Asian cuisine there and they all loved it - the demonstration window where you can see how they make the noodles and dumplings is pretty entertaining also.   My second favorite dish there is the dry spicy wanton noodle - pretty close to home and is \"actually\" spicy. Personally I prefer their dry noodles over soups, I wasn't too impressed with their noodle soups.   If you are into beef tendons like me, then make sure you try their Marinated Beef Tendon - I found it hard to find a place that serves decent beef tendon in Pittsburgh - the tendon pieces are usually too chopped up and thin, and not flavorful enough. The ones from Everyday Noodle is pretty delish compared to the other places.  The only downside is it is slightly pricey for students, compared to some other Asian restaurants, but once in a while it is a good treat!",
