    "text": "I've been to Kassab's several times, both for sit-down dinners and for pick up orders to-go.  I've never been disappointed.    Usually, this is my go-to stop for a quick dinner to-go.  If you order falafel and hummus it's a perfect dinner and it is ready in 5-10 minutes.    For sit down dinners, I get fancy and try the other dishes.  My favorite is Kassab's moussaka.  The vegetarian and original offering are both delicious.  I always recommend it for those who aren't familiar with this type of food because it's just pure comfort food.  Pair this with hummus, baba, or their delicious tabbouli, and it's one of my favorite meals on the planet.  I've also had the kafta and shawarma, both the best I've had in Pittsburgh!   Finish your meal with some of their baklava, which I'm not usually a fan of, but theirs seems pretty good.    The service has always been very good.  The staff is extremely attentive and prompt.  Bring your own alcohol and save a little money, too, which is unique to just a few restaurants on the South Side.  Kassab's often looks empty when I pass, so I hope that more people treat themselves to this gem!",

    "text": "Hands-down best Lebanese food in Pittsburgh!  I work nearby Kassab's, so I find myself ordering from here A LOT. I mean, like, a falafel-sandwich-at-least-once-a-week A LOT. Their falafel sandwich, which I greatly prefer to their falafel platter, is probably the best falafel sandwich I've ever had. The sandwich includes lettuce, tahini, pickles, the crunchiest balls of falafel (ever), and tomatoes - feta optional (but ohhhh, so worth it). Everything is served on fresh and delicious pita bread.  The sandwiches here will run you about $6-10 a pop, but they're larger than most sandwiches. My wallet always urges me to split my sandwich into two meals, but I assure you, eat it in one sitting! The pita's always soft and fresh, so it tends to get soggy if left overnight.  I've only dined in once and the service was efficient and friendly. No qualms here. Cute Mediterranean-inspired decor as well.",

    "text": "A foursome of lovely ladies were looking for a place to eat some good cheap food and we were directed to Kassab's by our Pittsburgh resident.  Kassab's is definitely not fussy, but I liked that more.  Service was very pleasant and attentive.  The Mezza platter was great and perhaps even too much for the four of us to share.  I ordered the falafel sandwich and found it to be quite good, but perhaps a bit on the dry side.  They skipped the tzatziki sauce, but no worries as I just got some on the side.  My dining mates shared the Kafta platter and it was too much for them.  In fact, all of the food was excessive.  You definitely get your money's worth.  We had lots of leftovers.  I only wish I had left room for some of the Baklava.",

When I used to travel with my boss, we would just order a bunch of falafel wraps to go from the woman that used to answer the phone by yelling, \"KASSAB!\" Awesome roadtrip food.   Now, more often, I get the portabella wrap. It's messy, but worth it and you can just eat the last few bits with a fork. Great pickled veggies and hummus.  It's gone more upscale since the old days, but also pricier. Oh well, glad they can survive the rents on Carson.",

I used to go to the original location when they were at the corner of 10th and East Carson and followed them as they moved to 12th and East Carson.  Although I wouldn't consider myself a regular, I do get cravings for this place from time to time.    I usually get the stuffed grape leaves - meat please!  And the falafel sandwich or platter.  Make sure you go with company b/c it's too much food to eat alone especially if you get an appetizer.  I recently tried the baba ganoush and it was delish and flavored perfectly.    FYI - They only accept cash if your order is under $10.00.  But if over $10 buckaroos, feel free to use a credit card.",

    "text": "Places like this are great because I feel like no matter how many people I tell about it, I know it'll never get overrun; it's just looks too plain to ever go supernova. Even though Kassab's doesn't promise much from the outside, or inside for that matter, it has some of the best food I've ever scooped, licked or scraped off a plate.   Before eating here I think I thought Lebanese food fell under the umbrella term \"Mediterranean\" for me, kind of like how El Salvadorian food was a synonym for \"Mexican\" before I ever ate a pupusa. Of course, I was totally wrong on both counts.  My first experience with Kibbeh (a Saturday-only special) went surprisingly well considering I had no idea what I was ordering and I received a large football-shaped pile of raw lamb. Kibbeh is ground lamb mixed with crushed wheat and sided with raw onions, pickled beets and pepperoncini.   This might still be sounding borderline gross so just let me say that the texture was a big part of the appeal of the dish and that anything you put on pita and top with hummus and pickled beets has to be pretty good.   Speaking of hummus and baba ganoush-they were both as smooth, creamy and luxurious as a glass of organic whole milk. There's something beautiful about making a perfect appetizer by pureeing a few great ingredients together and serving them on warm bread.  Warm dolmathes that were plump and slightly buttery in flavor made me feel like I'd never eaten one before, so if you've never had one make sure this is your first. If you have had one before, go here and get the nasty briny taste of the canned versions out of your mouth.   The sauce served with lamb skewers was mostly a thin tomato base with a light sweet hit of cinnamon swirling under the savory: drizzled over the rice and with a fat little piece of lamb made for a very satisfying bite.  And BYOB seals the deal.",

I wasn't blown away by the taste or quality of the entrees or desserts. I ordered the moussaka, which was rather dry and bland. My boyfriend ordered the chicken kebab. He also commented that his dish was bland, and kept topping his chicken with the delicious hummus and tabouli to flavor it up. One of his favorite desserts is baklava, so we ordered some. Very dry. If you like rosewater, then you will like their baklava, because the flavor is quite dominant.    I vacillated between three and four stars. I really enjoyed the Mezza platter. The waitress was kind, and the prices were reasonable. I simply wanted to be more impressed by the main course(s). I think its a great place to bring a friend who wants to venture into more \"exotic\" foods, but doesn't want to be blown away by spices.",

We weren't interested in getting a wide variety for yelp-reporting purposes. We wanted the feedbag. Yum. The kids and I agreed the Gyros were top notch, and Mrs. Junk raved on the shawarma, which was also tasty. The huge portions left us stuffed, even without side dishes, the place was spotlessly clean and warm on a cold day (so many restaurants keep the thermostat low, and then there's that door opening and closing (I'm talking to you, Ramen Bar) brrrrrrr). Finally, the server--a tallish young guy--was friendly and attentive, filling my water glass as fast as I could drink, etc. All in all, an excellent lunch for about $35 for 4. Can't beat that.",

    "text": "Going with three stars for Kassabs it is more greek-american style than authentic lebanesey middle eastern cuisine.  Though some of the dishes i wish leaned a little more towards traditional lebanese cue in Tabbouleh, it either usually has too much parsley or too little, not enough mint or lemon.  The hummus is just ok i know its one of those things, you like it or you don't I don't mind salty hummus but just a tad more garlic and it would be good.  Kafta: Ive had it before it and it was like-able no big issues but, then I had it a second time it was wayyyyyyy over-spiced. It was served in a wrap with pickled beets, chopped green spicy peppers, and ground lamb meat. The meat was a little overcooked and over-spiced when paired with the spicy pepper Aden tomato. It was a lot going on all at once, the beet and but remember salty. The peppers - needed to be toned down too many = too much spice, the parsley- slow down on it there are other herbs. It left me wondering it if they had a new chef?   The falafel: ok kind of hard to screw this one up, I will say it tastes like its made from a mix and it is a bit dry. Shout out to O'falafel in salt lake city who make their's in a burger patty shape keep it soft and moist in the middle and crispy on the outside and use fresh herbs mmmmmm.   I have never had a bad experience with the service, one server is pretty tall dark and handsome I cannot complain about parking, there are side streets behind Carson which is nice. Which is what gets this place more than a 2 star review, If you're a foodie sort of you will not love this place.  If you like more Greek style cuisine you will like it, the decor is nice bathroom was spotless.",

They seriously have the best hummus in town - nothing fancy just traditional hummus but it is so creamy and silky with just the right amount of spices - it is a MUST if you go there.  My favorite two dishes other than the stellar hummus are the falafel wrap and the lamb wrap.  On my most recent visit my friend and I both got the House Special Salad.  I typically shy away from salads with only iceberg lettuce but I ordered it and oh my lord it was absolutely delicious! Their house-made dressing with shredded feta cheese is to DIE for!  I don't think that I've enjoyed an iceberg salad so much in all my years!  Both the regular Moussaka and Vegetarian Moussaka are fab as well!  One of my friends swears by the Kafta, too, which I have yet to try, but boy did it look delicious.  If you have room for dessert (which is unlikely) then I highly recommend the baklava paired with a cup of their delicious coffee!",

It's the next best thing in Pittsburgh. It comes fresh in a warm pita and has the option of de-kosherizing with a feta option, which I almost always do :) The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and draws a great lunch and dinner crowd. Make your next stop in the southside to Kassabs for an escape to a cultural oasis through Lebanese cuisine!",

The spinach pie had rock hard pieces throughout. When pointing it out to the server he snarkly replied \"uhhhh ohhhhhkay\". The Kafta never saw any sort of seasoning or the hummus the \"lebanese style\" had stated. What a disaster. Service was horrible. 4 minutes to receive a coke at a place that was more or less empty. No apology for the crappy spinach pie. Save your time and money. Plenty of other restaurants in Pittsburgh that will appreciate your business and deliver on basic customer service. This place fell way short.",

What does a gas station have to do with Lebanonese food?  Well, a lot!  They sell a scaled down version, a sampling if you will, of very delicious Lebanonese food.  Homemade grape leaves, baba ganoush, hummus.......umm!  The proprietor is the semi-retired chef of the Lamont Restaurant on Mt. Washington.  I'm sure when word gets around, and the snafu at Rt. 88 and Rt. 51 is over, this will be a go-to place for an excellent taste of Lebanon.  Did I mention how bright and clean it is?   :-)",

    "text": "Another place I finally went to, then immediately kicked myself for never having eaten here!  Wife got the Grilled Lamb Pita, I got the Beef Schwarma Pita.  I got feta cheese, but on the side.  My wife does not like hummus, but her order came with it, so I said put it on the side.  Long story short, every aspect of the entire meal was great.  The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Same with the Schwarma.  And the hummus, the wife finished it off.  It was smooth, and tasty, delicious.  I am really used to hummus that is just a bit grainy, and  has a pronounced tahini and lemon flavor.  usually just on this side of bitter.  I mean, I like hummus, but I always assumed it was supposed to taste a little bitter.  The hummus here was a revelation.  It was smooth and creamy.  And the tastes were so mild, you could taste all of the individual ingredients, but it all blended into a smooth delicious flavor unlike anything I have ever had before with hummus.  It was GREAT!  The side of feta cheese was also something new and delicious.  And again, I was so used to feta cheese being hard, a little bitter, sharp tasting.  In this case, the feta was shredded.  It was smooth and tasty, and melted in my mouth.  The lamb and the beef schwarma pitas were every bit as good.  This place usurps every other middle eastern pita or wrap I have ever had anywhere, ever, at any time, ever in my life.  Ever.  I am off tomorrow as well, and am going to do the vegetarian thing.  In fact, up until now, my line had always been \"if all food was as good as Indian food, I would be able to be a vegetarian.\".  Now, the vegetarian thing includes this place.  I am going to update the review if I remember.  I was going to do Taj Mahal lunch buffet, but am coming back to Kassab's, and I am getting the sleek, the eggplant stuff, that parsley grain salad, etc (sorry, I dont remember the names of the items, but I know the ingredients!).  Thursday.  Vegetarian day at Kassab's.  I can't wait!  YUM!",

I'm not sure if that's the normal here but it created a fun enviroment.  Sad to say that I didn't know it was BYOB or we would have brought vino or beer beverages in.....tonight it was water for my SO and I...(SO meaning significant other).  We ordered the hummus and pita bread which was excellent.  I ordered the chicken house salad which comes with iceburg lettuce, toms, olives, cheese, cucumber, chicken.  HUGE!  The dressing is good stuff...Kevan (SO) ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which looked like a gyro.  I had a bite and could not even identify the spice but wow that kick was good!  The total cost $24 without tip.  I did notice there are some more expensive dinner style options here which i will go back and try no doubt (like the filet skewers).  This is a great place for some Lebanese style grub.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND and BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The dinner platter sizes are large.  I suggest splitting or being prepared to take food home unless you're really hungry.  Often they have daily specials that are absurdly inexpensive so be sure to check the sidewalk board. (I.e. $5 sandwich specials for example that are huge)",

The interior is nice and cozy with tall ceilings and greek mural drawings on the wall. I really enjoy the ambiance. We always go for lunch when it's not too busy. I get their lamb gyro with cheese. The feta cheese they put on top makes taste even better. The taste of fresh tomatoes and lettuce, plus their sauce is outta this world. It's probably the best gyro on the south side.  I've never tried too much of their other food except their meat pie which is store bought not freshly prepared so those i would have to say were pretty bad. they were very dry! Just bread and ground beef with no real flavor. we pushed it to the side while waiting for our gyro. I read that the grape leaves weren't too appetizing so it leaves me to wonder what else this place has to offer?  Update, I tried the grape leaves and they were ok. A little on the tender side and by tender I mean too soft. I've had better before so I guess that's what I am comparing them too.",

This is a typical restaurant for South Side, old building, pretty clean, simple, more of a bar with an eating space, than a restaurant.   We were sat at a table right next to the door in the middle of walkway practically, we asked to move but they said they were expecting a large party to take up the back area. So we stayed, ordered the hummus, which i read was the best in the burgh...ugh, it was super runny and not too good, the stuff from the store is better. Dont know why people would think this is good, not bad, but really not good at all.   Our waitress was busy setting up the room for a party of 30 she said, as a result we sat while staff were carrying tables and clanging chairs around us for 10 minutes, highly annoying. They are leaving your table before they put down what was in their hands, they seemed bothered to wait on us. Just wasn't an atmosphere to relax or enjoy food so we left.   Had the service been better we would have stayed for dinner, maybe it would have been good. When will places understand that alot of us are not out just to shove food in our faces and leave, we want a good experience, I can cook myself, I go out for the experience.",

Ummm...seriously? You couldn't have figured that out sooner? Add another 20 minutes before the food comes out.

The Beef Shawarma was what I usually gravitated towards, but I have also had their spicy fish sandwich, portobello sandwich, steak sandwich, filet sandwich- all delicious. My boyfriend loved the chicken shawarma, but it was a little too dry for me so I normally opted for something else on the menu.   The Mjaddara and Filet Kabob are also excellent as main dishes. The grape leaves and Baba Ghannoj were our favorite of the appetizers. I am not big on Falafel but our friend swears by the ones here. We would also order some pita, the red sauce (served with the filet kabob and lamb), and their homemade salad dressing on occasion as well if cooking at home and wanted a taste of Kassab's. The staff were always very nice and even got to know our orders.    The only down side to Kassab's is now we live 9 hours away and really miss our Lebanese fix. Good thing we still have family in Pittsburgh :)",

I've had great experiences and I've had the \"meh\" variety, but I never dock them for it. I don't know if it's the casual setting or the BYOB part, but I always enjoy my time there.  I highly recommend the hummus plate for starters, which I'm convinced is just Pitaland hummus and pita, but that's fine by me. Also, any of the lamb plates are great. The wraps are wonderful, but I think they do best with a full entree.   The only thing that sucks is that they're in the South Side, which I try to avoid a lot these days, but if you find parking then you're good to go. Grab a bottle and enjoy!",

We came around 6pm for dinner and the longer we were there, the more people showed up. We ordered wine and my fiance ordered a beer to sip on while we waited for our food. First we asked what kinds of wine they had. Her response was \"I don't drink so I really don't know\". She told us she would ask \"in the back\". We waited another 20 minutes and I finally pulled her aside to ask if she had checked on the wine (keeping in mind she was very busy and we didn't want to seem annoying). She then told us that \"the ladies in the back don't drink either so they don't know\". How do you not know what kind of wine you serve?? You don't have to drink to know this. This is your restaurant and we want to try a beverage. You really should know what you serve.   Long story short, we didn't end up getting our drinks until we were finished eating our dinner. I was really disappointed and again, felt bad for our waitress because she could only do so much. The food itself was 3 stars I would definitely go back, in spite of the poor service. Call me crazy, but it was that good. Two of us got the veggie moussaka and my fiance got the lamb shank. Platter #1 was amazing and we had no room for dessert. Check out the pictures.",

The walls are painted with various Mediterranean and Middle Eastern scenes, offset by the light coming in through the front windows. We were invited to find a seat on our own and waited on by the most efficient waiters I've ever seen. The restaurant got crowded, busy, and he never stopped - but everyone got great and timely service.  The menu is fairly standard, with lots of vegetarian and vegan offerings, grape leaves, pickled veggies, salads. Meat-eaters get the other half of the menu, with lamb, spicy chicken, shawarma, steak and gyro offerings. We ordered a veggie platter, with pickles, onions, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers and feta; and a hummus to go with - great for making little bites with all the ingredients.  I ordered a spicy chicken wrap, and the spouse a mixed grill platter. Both were excellent - grilled lavash bread with a marinated chicken breast, plenty of veggies and yogurt sauce. The spouse had a delicious tomato-y sauce to dip his meats in, and lots of rice. One of our companions had a gyro platter - big chunks of gyro meat with all the ingredients on the plate. Everything was tasty, and we could add the hummus, sauce, and bits from our appetizer to the mix. The portions were ample, but we did not leave much on any plate.  Our server was a whirlwind of activity, getting our order, bringing our coffee, and then our appetizers all right on time, all with a friendly and unhurried manner. Other tables were coming in and were not left to wait, either. An excellent choice for lunch on Carson.",

One of those places I was embarrassed I hadn't tried yet because it's been around for so long!  I've been on a Greek food kick lately so I was craving some grape leaves.  Recently I've had some really awful grape leaves at the Arts Fest (I know, what was I thinking!) and some really awesome ones at another festival that has a strong Greek heritage in the community.  I like chilled grape leaves that are tightly wound.  The grape leaves here are loosely wound and a tad on the  mushy side.  The really awful ones I had were super mushy and unedible.  These were still good, had an okay lemon flavor, but they were served warm and I felt like they may not have been marinated long enough.  Not impressed  I also ordered the Tabbouli which had WAY too much parsley and not enough of the goodstuff... onions and tomatoes.  It also said it came with fresh warm pita bread.  I did not get that pita bread.  Which brings me to my next point...  The server was miserable.  From start to finish I knew she did not want to be there.  Serving to me is fakin' it til you make it!  You gotta work for that tip... I mean, if you're a server you usually have to have some kind of personality, right?  Even if she did, it was not her day.  I think that's why I did not get my pita bread.    Honestly, not having the best experience, I don't know if I'd be back.",

    "text": "Friday Night on Pittsburgh's South Side can be a harrowing adventure during which one can expect to encounter many varieties of the drunken yahoo. Recently, I caught a concert at The Rex Theater on that favored time of the week for 9-to-5'ers and was in need of belly fuel. It was then that I remembered Kassab's, an eatery I had not been to since joining Yelp 5 years ago. Thus, I'd found dinner.  Having been fixated on gyros of late, I ordered one up and waited for a spell at a window seat whilst sipping on an effervescent ginger ale, taking in the nocturnal parade of hipsters, yuppies, bros, bimbos, drunks, punks, freaks, and attention-seekers on infamous Carson Street.   Kassab's interiors merge the modern and urban with the rustic and folksy. Vibrant murals seemingly came to life on the walls as patrons chattered happily beneath them.  As big as a rolled-up newspaper. Kassab's gyro could best be described as a lamb meatloaf wrap. The pita was more like a tortilla in that it was thin and somewhat bubbled and charred. The meat itself was butter-soft, my canines sinking through it easily. Filling it out was the standard lettuce-tomato-onion trinity with a tangy, creamy, white condiment that Kassab's calls \"Tahini sauce.\" Call it tzatziki, yogurt or whatever you prefer -- this is what makes or breaks gyros, and the sauce certainly made it sing in this instance. While not reaching the gastronomic highs that other gyros in the Pittsburgh area have achieved in regards to my palate (see It's Greek To Me, Knossos, Lesvos, Mike & Tony's, Central Diner & Grille), Kassab's take on the Greek staple is as worthy a contender as you'll find.  For dessert, I opted for a serving of their fascinating rice pudding. Thick like a custard, the pudding was seasoned with something quite occult that nearly intoxicated me with its licorice flavors. With my curiosity piqued so, I asked my excellent server about the secret ingredient but couldn't hear what he told me over the clatter (was this purposeful?). Nonetheless, the pudding was a marvelous and mysterious way to end my meal.  The long, plump gyro and chilly, rich pudding kept me bangin' long into the early morning hours with not a single hunger pang. With so much upheaval occurring in the South Side, don't overlook Kassab's lest you miss out on some mighty fine and fairly economical Greek fare your damn self.",

I didn't liked the bread as much, it was very thin a bit flavorless, but the hummus was so rich that it made up for it. I also had a side of gyro meat that was delicious!

Their customer service is top notch, and their food is not to be missed (although it is easy to pass up driving down East Carson Street). I have been to Kassab's with just two people, and with groups up to about 20 and they accommodated both with ease.   Kassab's frequently has a $5 menu of favorites like hummus and even chicken shawarma. The mezza platter is great to start with (hummus, baba, tabbouli, feta and olives served with pita), but make sure you have a handful of people, since the appetizer is a healthy size. My favorite thing to get at Kassab's is the lamb sheesh kebab. On one occasion I even tried the raw kibbee, which I wouldn't try just anywhere, but was PHENOMENAL!   Kassab's now has a full bar, but used to be BYOB. They even have a variety of Lebanese beer and wine!",

There was three of us and we still had plenty of food left, considering we didn't order that much.   1.  Falafel.  They came in donut shapes and taste freakin' amazing. 2.  Mezza plate:  hummus, baba ghanoush.  Lots of pitas.  3.  Lamb kabob.  I know my lamb.  This was damn good lamb. 4. Spinach pies.

We started with the Baked Kibbee, which the carnivores in our party loved...so much so that a few of us vegetarians tried at least the cracked wheat tops...and it was delicious. I then ordered and shared the Grilled Vegetables, which were topped with feta..and everyone agreed the taste was a savory mix just the right spices, and the light dusting of cheese helped accent the flavorful mix just right. Would definitely urge everyone to try this dish! For entrees, I was again completely satisfied with the vegetarian moussaka, and the others in my party tried the falafel and the mixed grill entrees. And for every dish, there was only praise. This was all of ours first visit, but we agree that we will return! Simply a delicious and delightful experience!",

I knew I would never go back to Kassab's when we ordered the Chicken Shawrama and tabouli salad.  The chicken was dry, did not have any sauce, and the pita was crunchy.  The salad was not fresh, it was soggy and flavorless.  I called and asked to speak with the manager who refused to speak with me.  The waitress who relayed my complaint to the manager while I was on the phone with her was screamed at by the manager who I could hear yelling that the chicken was fine and the food is all fresh. The service here has always been iffy, but we put up with it because the food was always spot on...it seems that since they opened their bar the food has declined.  Not sure if the two are connected, but after hearing the way the manager spoke to the waitress, inadvertently addressing my complaint, we will not be returning to Kassab's.  They need to realize the importance of their customers and treat people with respect.",

Admittedly, Middle Eastern food is not my favorite cuisine, but I've had some very flavorful chicken kabobs and shawarma ELSEWHERE that I really enjoyed. Not so much here.   The menu is pretty basic--consisting of mainly sandwiches, kabobs, falafel, and humus. There was no shawarma to be found.   So I had a chicken kabob. The chicken tasted like it had been marinated in salty dishwater. It came with a generous portion of rice and a salad that had a couple of tomato wedges, a slice of cucumber, and lots of feta cheese.  Filling, but nothing I will be in a hurry to go back for. Also, while not expensive, $14.99 for the above mediocre meal didn't exactly seem like a bargain either.  Bottom line: my one meal here seemed bland and slightly overpriced compared to what I've had at other Middle Eastern restaurants. However,  the hummus was good, so maybe it's worth trying something else another time.",

They were very generous with the falafel serving; and, for $5.99 it was a great price for a quick, tasty meal before an evening at City Theater. Out of the few restaurants I've grabbed a quick bite from before heading to a show, this is perhaps my favorite. It's quick, the service is good, the prices are relatively inexpensive even for a dinner platter, and the food is tasty.  It may not be an ideal location for impressing a first date before a show because the interior does resemble a nice cafeteria. Personally, I wouldn't mind, but that's just cuz I'm a cheap date :)",

I had to ask the server atleast three times to bring back some more.  The bread wasn't that great. I had a Chicken Shawarma, it was not very good, actually it was a joke. between the extremely overcooked chicken, poorwrap job and the fact it had absolutely no flavor. What's the point of coming back and trying something on their overpriced menu.The lovely special lady order a chicken gyro and it was basically just as bad except that it was drowned in Cucumber sauce and some feta cheese that they had the never to charge us an extra dollar for. Ali Baba is a better bet and the prices are better at Ali Baba. Thanks",

We were all very happy tasting and catching up. The patter did not stand much of a chance with us...  Entree included Loobyeh (green beans, rice, spices and tomatoes), Kafta Kabob, Falafel Platter, and traditional (with lamb) Moussaka. The entrees were served with a great salad-simple house salad but with tangy dressing and feta is became 0H-so-good! We all needed to take leftovers home but were not too stuffed to turn away dessert. Over coffees and shared Cream Caramel and Rice Pudding, we laughed and relaxed.  Our server was delightful and she patiently answered questions and attended us without any rush (and we took out good ole' time!)  Great unassuming restaurant!!",

This is a great laid back restaurant because 1) I have never once had to wait for a table 2) everything on the menu is relatively inexpensive, I have never paid more than $15 including a starter and a meal, and 3) it is BYOB so it is perfect for a small get together with your friends because you will not have to worry about disturbing a crowded restaurant.  Additionally there is not a corking fee, at least there was not as of last summer.  I recommend the tabbouleh or tomato and mozzarella (actually its so big it could be a meal) for a starter, and  the grape leaves are great as well.",

Unfortunately, because I have fallen in love with a selection of the dishes, we always end up ordering some combination of the following : Dolmeh (with meat), Spicy Chicken (really spicy!), Kafta, or Shawarma sandwiches, Lamb kabob (grilled to a medium rare perfection and served with almond rice and smokey grilled onion), Spinach pie (like spanikopita).  So, I have yet to venture off of these staples and continue to try new items! Another favorite: the house dressing; it's a yogurty sauce spiced with garlic and lemon juice- maybe their house tahini?  Whatever the ingredients, this tangy  concoction is amazing!  The restaurant itself is small, and we have never needed to make reservations (both pluses in my book, especially when I'm needing to satisfy a craving!)  Of course, one of the other attractive qualities of Kassab's is that it's BYOB, and there's no corkage fee! I absolutely love this place, and will definitely be going back for more  :)",

Great ambiance with perfect lightning and the huge colorful wall mural/painting (wow - I remember the hole-in-the-wall old location on the corner many years ago - monumental improvement to say the least).  Kassab's usually has very quick and friendly service despite the fact that the 1 or 2 servers are covering a very busy lunch crowd. I always seem to get my unsweetened ice tea refilled once or twice just when I need it.  I need to expand and explore the selection of dishes that I try at Kassab's.  I usually go with the lamb pita sandwich (with no cheese) - incredible.  This does NOT seem like a healthy option because they cook the ground lamb with a quite a bit of oil but very yummy.  The add a touch of hummus on the lamb sandwich which makes it perfect.  Another favorite at Kassab's is the baba ganoush with pita.  I have mixed feelings and results from the falafil pita sandwich at Kassab's - I am pretty picky about my falafil.  The Kassab's version is huge compared to most but could sometimes use a little more flavor, sometimes a tad mushy.  I think there are better falafil options in Squirrel Hill - hey maybe a Talk thread is in order on this topic!   Similar to some other Yelpers, I am NOT a big fan of warm grape leaves from Kassab's (and the tabouli could use a little kick in the @$$) but perhaps those 2 are made in the Lebanese style?  I am looking forward to trying new things on the menu someday soon!",

Their version has the meat, herbs, onions, tomato, and lettuce tightly wrapped in something a little thicker than a tortilla but a lot thinner than pita bread.
