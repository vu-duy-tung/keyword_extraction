Parking can be difficult, the dining area could use some TLC, and it is unfortunately that you better carry cash with you because that is the only form of payment they accept and it could be expensive. They do offer an ATM if you forget. Minor unfortunates, however, the pizza is a must try if you never had it.",

I would definitely go back and order a pie with 1/2 the amount of cheese and some toppings.  Some may love the cheese but I, like Darren, found it overwhelming.",

Have been told that the ingredients are fresh even the sauce is homemade and the I like the sauce flavors, although not to spicy and a nice tomato taste.  I think the cheese may be one of the reasons it is so good.     This is not a NY or Chicago style, a crust that is tasty and a thin medium (is there a thin medium?) and a nice texture with a crispy crust edge.  Mineo's seems to put more cheese on then many pizza places and usually I don't want a lot of cheese but it works at Mineo's.  Sometimes the cheese seems to get a little greasy looking but not today, and it is always good.   The pepperoni slices are thicker and very tasty.    Cash only but an ATM on sight.",

I actually like their sauce, and the cheese is good. If anything there's too much cheese!  The restaurant itself is kind of shabby. I don't look too closely at the floor and doubt the grated cheese ever sees the inside of a fridge, but it's nice to have this place within walking distance for a quick slice of pizza. The fact that they have ice cream makes it a good place to take kids, too.",

Come here on occasion, but Aiellos wins across the board. ____________________________________________ Ambience: (3/5). Dim lighting, dingy pizza parlor table-tops, and framed accolades and family photos turn this into a pizza den. Crowded, booth-only dining area save for the stools for the island in the middle. The front counter is the kitchen, so you'll leave smelling like pizza. ____________________________________________ Service: (3/5). Rushed but pleasant. The 10+ people behind the counter swap in and out, delivering pies and taking orders. It's cafeteria style, vending machine included, and you do have to give them your dirty tray.  ____________________________________________ Drinks: (1/5). Soda, and nothing special. Ice cream is served next door. ____________________________________________ Food: (3/5). An experience in excess, and if you want grease and cheese, this is it. The cheese is thicker than the crust, slides off at least 50% of the time. 2-3 paper plates are soaked at the end of a pepperoni.. spicy and occasionally burnt. Crust is thin and absorbs a large amount of grease. The sauce is occasionally burnt on, otherwise thin, thankfully salty. Pepperoni or mushroom are good bets here, as are onion and sausage. You DO NOT need extra cheese.",

If you are a New Yorker, or like a New York style of pizza, I really don't think that you will care for the pizza here. I would recomment Aiello's (right next to it), or even better Pizza Bellino which is a few blocks away on Forbes.",

    "text": "Aw hell. I heard good things about this place but was once again left wrestling with how to rate a restaurant.  I dunno guys, I got that Fiori's feeling. Regular readers will remember my 2 controversial reviews of that particular establishment.   Now, the crust was done rather well; crunchy and a little chewy. The sauce was so gloriously, thickly succulent I kept licking it from of my fingers.   That cheese, blanketed over the pepperoni (our lone topping today),  was ALL Fiori's, and therefore killed it for me. One could use it to caulk up windows or plug leaky tires.  Like Fiori's, Mineo's cheese is gummy, not yummy and even slid right off of each slice as we bit into it. You should not have to eat the cheese apart from the pizza or keep trying to reapply it. Unforgivable.   Put some of DeMino's or DiCarlo's cheese on Mineo's pizza, and you'd have a near-classic. Maybe I can get them to sell me a cheeseless pizza so I can put my own cheese on it. Brie perhaps? Hmmm.   We ordered a pair of cannoli for dessert, and while they weren't bad with their chocolate-lined ice-cream cone quality, the cream inside wasn't sweet enough. No one seems to be able to make a better cannoli than Kribel's Bakery in Brookline, and I was almost charged 16 dollars for them! The guy behind the counter forgot that we already paid for our pizza, which brings me to the service...  The staff epitomizes Gen-X slackerdom. Oh, they look cool with their tats, piercings, and subversive tees straight outta South Side or Lawrenceville, but their hospitality is like, Dullsville, man. They take your order, you pay for it at the counter (Was the cat tryin' to hustle me as he coughed incessantly into his hands?), and then they just put your pizza up onto said counter, quietly calling out \"It's ready.\" We had to make eye contact with one of the help so that we knew our pepperoni pizza was finished.  I had to get up, take the hot pie pan back to our table (OUCH!!! %^&&$!!!!), and then go back to get the flimsy PAPER plates and strangely enough, real silverware. We also had to bus our own tables.   As wildly busy as they can be, at least Beto's brings your food out to your table after you order it and manages to offer a superior (albeit odd) pizza to boot. Mineo's was rather slow today, so there was no excuse for such lazy, detached service.  However, I will say that it is rather posh looking inside (it's in a posh side of town) with a nice refrigerated case displaying all sorts of pastas, salads, and expensive desserts (12 bucks for a slice of cake? Nuh-uh). And again, that pizza would have been an easy 4 stars with better cheese, but I have to be honest and go 3, regardless of their lineage to the fabled Mineo's in Squirrel Hill. Sorry guys, this is the best I can give yinz.   Yes, they have a tip jar.   No, I dropped not a nickel into it.",

It's a great place to go for lunch or even late at night!  I love how you can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza if you want. We always get Mineo's take-out for our Steelers parties or if we're just craving some great pizza of course!   I love the people that work there too.  They're always really friendly. Probably my only complaint about this place is that they only take cash.  Sometimes we don't end up ordering from here if we don't happen to have cash on us.  However, this usually doesn't stop us!   I'm a Pittsburgh native, but I've lived in LA for a year now, and I'm always craving Mineo's!  Every time I'm back in Pittsburgh I have to get some!!  Definitely the best pizza ever!!

I'd heard great things about it and knew it was a local old-school place (the kind that only takes cash). I was very fair and got the same toppings on every pie I ordered so that i was judging them equally.  I was so disappointed with my meal at Mineo's. The pizza was just...nothing special. I've had more distinctive pizza pies at Vocelli's for God's sake. It was simply a generic pizza and didn't have anything special to write home about it. It's a very standard pizza.  The place itself is sort of a dive, but if they had out-of-this-world pizza they could get away with being quirky instead of just depressing. But they don't. It's making me sad just remembering having to sit in that Formica-laden place while a group of teenage, pimply boys watched tv and giggled behind the counter while they made my food.  By contrast, A'Badamo's just a block away has mouth-watering genuine New York-style pizza and they take credit cards to boot!  Anyways, now every time I seen someone walk out of Mineo's with a big pizza box I shudder and withhold the urge to cry, \"Why!?!\" at them.",

I don't know what Mineo's uses for cheese, but it never fails that all of the cheese drops off of the slice when you take a bite.  My kids cannot get through eating a slice without this happening and it only happens at here.  Mineo's needs desperately to remodel the shop and for the love of God, GET A CREDIT CARD READER.  This is 2016 not 1956.  No one carries cash any more.  I hate having to make a trip to the ATM to get cash just so I can get pizza.  Clean the place up and take my debit card and you're back on the list, until then though, it's up the road to Badamo's.",

    "text": "I had lived in Oakland for so long as a student that I kind of forgot that Mineo's was still around; I'm ashamed that I did. This was one of my favorite places as a child - I distinctly remember being brought here for fresh pizza and for the chocolate cake slices they used to serve. Now instead of it being the place my parents would buy a tasty treat from, Mineo's has become my favorite place to go and grab a snack after a long day of work in a shop down the street.   This place is not only cheap (when compared to many other places), it is outright delicious - everything is either cut from a fresh pie or is made fresh and tossed into their oven right after you order. In my experience everything comes out piping hot and cooked to perfection. If I want a single piece of pizza with a weird combination of toppings, they'll get it ready for me, no problem! And the cheese - this is a great place for pizza with a decent layer of cheese that's also paired with the right amount of homemade seasoned sauce. The result is a tangy mouthful of \"yum\" that always hits the spot.  Definitely one of the best local pizza places, even if you need to deal with things like paper plates (admittedly not the best thing to use when trying to eat pizza fresh out of an oven). The seating isn't exactly fancy, admittedly, but still better than what you'd find at a total dive of a place. For quick eats, it works - and it's been clean, cozy, and decent in my experience.  And hey, if you really don't want to sit and eat here, just get your pizza to go - you'll enjoy it all the same!",

I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni to go for less than $5. I was sad that they didn't have an actual pepperoni pie; they just slapped pepperoni on the plain slices and tossed it in the over. That's my only complaint.  When I got home, I was really excited to get to chewing. The bottom crust was crunchy and good (I couldn't eat the end bits of crust because it was a little hard). The pepperoni was authentic, thick, and spicy. The pizza was super greasy and cheesy, but flavorful and delicious.  I will be trying again when I have the cash in my pocket.",

I have been a huge fan of this place since my first calzone in 1994. I haven't eaten there since 2004 or so, so I was going to take my GF there for some sunday night nostalgia snacking. We took  a traditional to go. I had 1/2,  she had 1/4 pcs, and as is our custom w/pizza we let the cats have a finger of mushy dough and sauce at around 2am when we have these carpet picnics. We woke up this morning and everyone in the house,( cats included!) were projectile emesis! I would have said, I deserved it eating so late, except the cats were sick too.  So, it looks like new management, cost cutting on toppings and the dough w/sauce lost it's firmness and it was quite unsatisfying, banal, and common. I would recommend Aiolio's three doors up, unless they've changed too. I'm considering a call to the health department. This is unsat!",

    "text": "Mineos Pizza is one of the most popular pizza shops in Pittsburgh, I assume it is because the people of Pittsburgh prefer walking around with mean streaks of fecal aftermath in their tight white Hanes.  A large cheese pizza (which is 16', or 12 slices for those of you who think that makes a difference) costs a rich neighborhoodly $17.50 (plus the $20 parking ticket which I will take half the blame for...bringing the pizzas total to $27.50).  The kid making the pizza was exactly 12 years old and was a spitting image of Ernie from Billy Madison, I was half expecting him to pee his pants mid pie.  Ernie has a lot to learn about making a pizza and the fact that it was 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday and no one in the kitchen was over the age of 20 makes sense as to why the pizza is so sloppy.    Mineos is making their pizza the traditional way, directly on the brick with no screens.  Ernie smothered the dough in flour to the point that the dough was all white and a bit powdery and it left a residue on your hands.  I can't say that I blame him for that thought because if he didn't use the giant hand full of flour to slide the pie in the oven than he wouldn't have been able to put the 9 pounds of cheese on the pie that Mr. Mineo requires for a pizza to be deemed edible.  The pie still didn't quite make its way into the oven without turning into a wonky oval shape.  The pizza was way too thin in the middle and the gelatinous wad of cheese that enveloped the pie made it pretty much impossible to pull the slices apart from each other.  This is the kind of pizza that you need to eat with a spoon.  You really can't eat it like pizza, you just kind of have to pick the cheese curd off and eat it by itself and then you can eat the crust afterwards.  The pizza was relatively well cooked, it lacked color but probably just because of the excessive flour.  The sauce was spread on fairly well but the cheese was just wadded on with absolutely no regard for my butt hole.  The dough has that typical bad salty cracker Pittsburgh type taste to it.  The crust has a pretty low hydration rate and is quite dry but you probably won't notice because you will be too busy choking on the grease from the cheese.  The middle of the pie was way too thin and the crust was pretty puffy.  The flavor of the dough is generic and salty.  The dough was also fairly dense.    The sauce wasn't bad, I would be curious to try this sauce on a pie that had a sensible amount of cheese.  The flavor is mostly derived from basil, oregano and sugar.  They are definitely using a lot of water in the sauce and adding sugar to offset it.  Its not the worst sugar water sauce I have had in the city but it certainly isn't great.  The tomatoes seem to be decent quality, no real chunks though just a thin even consistency.    The cheese ruined this pie.  It tastes like a mix of mozzarella and provolone, quite possibly some cheap stuff blended in with some good stuff.  I don't understand why any pizza shop would want to put so much damn cheese on their pizza when it is by far the most expensive part.  I can't even think of a joke, I just want to take a nap.  All in all this pizza just sucks.  Its sad to me that places like this are the standard for pizza in this city, its just breeding more fat oblivious ranch dressing dunkers.  People don't eat pizza like this because it tastes good, they eat it because it gets you high as fuck and releases all your happy lazy brain molecules so that you can just lard there and continue watching the latest scripted reality tv show.  I am feeling pretty defeated by this pizza, both in brain and bung.    4/10",

They also sell various flavors of ice cream which I'm sure complements the pizza perfectly. I've frequented Mineo's over the years and the quality has never ceased to impress.

The only thing I have to remember is to bring a bottle of water to bed because I always wake up so thirsty in the middle of the night after eating this for dinner.  It's nice they have this location (I used to have to trek to squirrel hill) and what might be the greatest thing I ever discovered  (or worst if you're my bathroom scale) is that they sell Prantl's burnt almond torte slices!!

One thing that makes Mineo's different from your standard pie is that the meat toppings are under the cheese, which I think prevents them from drying out during the baking process. This can be a good thing but I kind of like it when my pepperoni is a little crispy. I'm sure you can request them to place the toppings on top.   Overall, I like the pizza here and it's definitely a special, stand-out pie. The only thing I don't like is that it's cash only.",

My daughter stated that \"the sauce was gross\".  I have to agree.  I don't even want the leftovers.  I will stick with Fiori's.    I also agree with other reviewers that cash only is a drag.",

I did not get garlic bread I called and was told \"that's like the only one that doesnt come with garlic bread\" And i also ordered a side of rigatoni with butter which was $5.50 and i got about 15 noodles. So i paid $14.45 for my meal plus $3.55 tip so $18.00 and got this",

    "text": "Mineo's has the reputation for being one of the better pizza places in Pittsburgh. I've always heard good things about their pizza, but never got around to going to Mineo's before. I decided to finally stop in and give it a try to see how good it really was. I got two slices of Sicilian pizza and a small drink for lunch and the total came out to be $7.25 (just remember that Mineo's is cash only.) The pizza had a good combination of sauce, bread, and cheese. It was quite filling as well. Their pizza is delicious and I was able to get in and out for a quick lunch. Overall, I'd say Mineo's is a pretty good place to grab a slice (or a whole pie.)",

    "text": "I am so disappointed with mineos mt. Lebanon. I have been going to mineos in both locations for 30 years. The past 5 years I have lived in the south hills and used their delivery service. They even delivered to my house last weekend. I placed my order today and 20 minutes later they call to tell me that they don't deliver to my house. Mind you they have been delivering to me for 5 years here so it's a complete lie. They screwed up my dinner plans for my family and were rude when I called. It is pure laziness on their part and horrible customer service. They have lost a 30 year customer because of this. I ordered a pizza from Tomatoes II after and they were very friendly. Order pizza from anywhere other than mineos!!!! If I could give 0 stars I would but 1 is the lowest option.",

First off, my dogs food looks better than the steak that was on this salad. To add to the looks of it, it was ice cold steak. I'm guessing it was leftover pieces from a steak pizza and they were too lazy to make new steak for my salad. My other issue with the salad is there was HAIR IN IT! Disgusting. I'm always a fan of ordering from here but now that I've had this experience ...I'll think again.",

    "text": "It's okay.  Here is an objective review:  - The pizza is decent.  It's so standard.  It's what it looks like and what I expected, but nothing more.  (Dare I say, it's kind of like mall pizza.  Not bad at all, but zero on the special or unique scale.)  - The setting is old enough that it does not look extremely clean.  The whole place needs a re-fresh.  - Sorry, but CASH ONLY is a drag in 2014.  Who carries cash?  - The salads are a bright spot - very fresh and crisp, and big enough to share.  - The staff seem friendly, which is a plus.  The location is excellent, and I think that's the back-story.  Where else does a young pedestrian get a cheap slice that's decent?",

The pizza is amazing. We had pepperoni like we always do. It's our benchmark. Every part of the pizza was great. The sauce was unbelievable. Take my word on this. It's a great pie. Oh, even warmed up later it was just as good.",
