    "text": "Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night at 7pm and Alexander's was about half full. We decided to go simple and stick with the Pastabilities. I choose the Bolognese with penne  (~$12) and mushrooms (extra $1.50), while my husband ordered the Marfredo with farfelle ($11), sundried tomatoes and hot sausage (extra $4). Bolognese was solid though lacked mushrooms and my husband's dish was tasty too though the hot sausage was bland, it needed salt. Portions are huge, mine was easily two meals. Italian bread or rolls (not warmed up) w/ butter balls comes with the meal and there is EVOO on the table. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip cannolli which came with two - we enjoyed them but it pricey for the size $7. Aside from the dessert, the meal was reasonably priced.  Service was consistent with other Yelpers' reviews - really, really friendly. We liked our waitress. Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit. Also I ended up packaging my Bolognese home since I couldn't eat it all and she asked if we wanted the rolls too and wrapped my pasta in saran wrap for the trip home to prevent any sauce spillage which was a smart move since we had walked here.  One comment though would be on the decor. You walk in and the bar area somewhat has a modern feel but then once you go into the dining room it is like you are warped back into time. There is just a lot of visual stimulation - over the top - that just doesn't go together.  Overall though, Alexander's just gets it done - nothing fancy w/ home style food and  great prices and service. We'll be skipping other Italian places in the area and will be back again.",

    "text": "I haven't been here in many years, and it was a pleasant surprise. The food was great, and our server(Jonathan) was helpful, friendly and professional.  When I was trying to decide what to get, he was knowledgeable about the selections (and HIS favorites), and helped me choose. We began with an appetizer of calimari, which was cooked to perfection (NOT rubbery, like so many restaurants tend to serve). They have an awesome selection of unique salads, one of which I chose. My son ordered a pasta dish, which he thoroughly enjoyed. For dessert, we both got tiramisu, which is so often our choice wherever we go. My son and I agreed it was the best we ever had. It was served in a parfait glass, rather than on a plate in the traditional square,  and the cake portion was surrounded by a delicious mousse, garnished with tiny chocolate chips. An enjoyable experience,  all around! The entrees weren't outrageously priced, my son's pasta with clam sauce being $13.00, my asparagus and chicken salad $14.00(worth the price!) The tiramisu was $6.00 for each portion. Though it was clean and the atmosphere was nice, I do wish I didn't have to walk through the bar, especially as we were leaving,  as there was a customer who seemed to be acting rudely to the bartender. Also, my son and I agreed that we didn't want to sit under the table with the chandelier hanging over it, because the decorations on it looked old and dusty. Maybe they weren't, but they looked pretty musty.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life.   Someone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.  I'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \"Italian\" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.  Is this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Loved it!   I was not too excited about trying to eat healthy at an Italian joint, but went with friends. I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.  My friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.  In the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.  The waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.  Now I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer.   So - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens. If it were closer to home I'd be ready to move in.",

    "text": "OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!   Okay, the ambiance is cutesy and romantic. Upon arrival you are given a bread basket with HUGE Texas sized bread. I wasn't such a big fan because it was so soft that it seems to deteriorate while holding it. Little too messy for my liking. The bruschetta was not your typical bruschetta and honestly I would not recommend it. The Caesar salad is really a pity. Although it looks like a Caesar salad it doesn't taste like one since the lettuce, croutons, and dressing are all so flimsy. It hardly tasted like anything.   So why am I giving this place a 5 star review? Because the pasta is amazing! The best pasta I have ever had! Now I know why people with Italian mothers/grandmothers scoff at places like Olive Garden where they don't make their own noodles. What a difference it makes. The menu offers you a large selection of noodles (gluten free available) and sauces to choose from. I had the marfredo (mix of marinara and alfredo) and I was dying over how good it was. My girlfriend, who has an Italian family, had the aglio aoli (sp?) and she was also dying over how amazing this was.   DO COME HERE but don't waste any of your time with the appetizers or bread. Save your appetite for the pasta!   I didn't get to try the deserts but next time I want to try their tiramisu since all the deserts are also made on site.",

I ordered the create-your-own pasta with mafalda pasta, gorgonzola basil cream sauce, and chicken.  The sauce was actually quite tasty, although a bit on the strong side, and overpowered the chicken quite a bit.  It was definitely unique, however!  The bread that was served with the pasta was thick and soft, but wasn't particularly unique.  Service was fine, and the atmosphere was nice.  Overall, not a bad option for Italian food in Bloomfield, and I'd go back if a dining companion wanted to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return since there's better Italian to be had elsewhere in PGH.  3.5 stars.",

Our waitress was friendly and not pushy since we took a while trying to navigate the extensive menu options!   I ordered the tortellini. The dish was rich with the ricotta cheese and the creamy sauce. I finished only about half the dish. The flavors were good but it got to be too much after a while. The portion was also huge which may also have to do with my ability to finish it.   We also ordered the veal parm with pasta. The veal was cooked nicely. The meal came with 2 pieces of veal and a nice portion of pasta with marinara sauce. I liked it better than the tortellini. That dish didn't have anything left at the end of the meal!   For dessert we ordered the ice cream with candied nuts and the tiramisu. Both very good! The tiramisu was not too sweet and a nice portion to end the meal.",

It wasn't overly breaded and were were able to split it between six people and not worry about not having enough.

    "text": "Alexander's offers some of the worst Italian food I've ever had. I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander's gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).  Once the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn't even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.  Unfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom's plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend's Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I've ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.  The dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can't screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their \"fresh-made\" cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle's chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.  I did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city.",

We wound up only having 5 (who passes up free food?) but it was still a lovely dinner.  The waitress was really helpful in suggesting the best things to get.    I agree about the bread...it was just 'meh'.  We didn't get an appetizer, but the homemade salad dressing (ranch) was very (very) good.  I got the special for that night - fresh veal, and it was so so so good.  The waitress said it would melt in your mouth, and it did.  I also got the marfredo sauce on malfada pasta as my pasta side, based on other Yelp reviews of this combination and it was also quite good.    Overall, great food.  I would definitely return.",

To start off when we walked in the place REEKED of piss. Like someone has literally just peed on the floor. Our waitress showed us to a booth in the back where they were scraps and trash under and around our table. I asked her for a drink list she informs me there isn't one k fine I move on. Then we get an appetizer the fried ravoli which was prices at 8$ but only came with four bite size pieces on a plate. That's it. Now onto the meal I order a tortellini and marinara and my husband got the tuna. Mine came out with random mixed veggies In it(which I just picked around) and my husbands came out fine except his sauces came in plastic cups(it was a 20$ dish). Oh and that's not the end of it. After telling the waitress that I didn't receive what I ordered we had to listen to her and the cook scream at each other while we at. She then have us our check and then disappeared. We waited until I finally stopped another waitress to cash us out. I paid 65$ all together and it should have been free.",

I went the other night with my adult daughter. I had the calamari with pasta, a cocktail ( yum, yum), and a garden salad. The salad was very fresh and arrived promptly. The cocktail was strong but great. The calamari arrived quickly and was piled so high on the plate I could barely see over the plate! It was served on what tasted like fresh tomatoes over the pasta. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full.   My daughter had the salad too with linguini and clam sauce. It was loaded with clams. They were tasty and not rubbery. She suspected they were canned but since they were tender it was okay. The sauce was fragrant too, not fishy.   Our server was super efficient and polite. She kept up with us without being intrusive. The decor of the restaurant has been updated a bit over time. It's cute. A bit too bright for an Italian restaurant if you ask me, but I'm from New England where Italian places are all dimly lit.   Overall, a wonderful, easy going, friendly  neighborhood place to go to relax over some good food and drink. Have a few laughs without a tv interrupting your dinner conversation. You have to sit in the bar for that. Take your mom. Take the family. Take your husband when you can't stand another night of cooking. Just go it alone and who cares about anyone else?! Just have fun eating some really good food that tastes like someone cares.",

We were in our 20s and  the majority of the clientele was over 60. While the service may not have been to our liking, the food was pretty good. I had the tortellini verde which I liked but I enjoyed my girlfriends penne in their Gorgonzola sauce more.",

But the meatballs here are awesome!! 2 thumbs up!  For an entree I got a tortellini dish and my husband got ummm.....AHHHHH I don't know but it was very tasty. Something with angel hair pasta. Then we ordered dessert which at the end of the meal our waitress told us was on her because we came out in such bad weather (it's pretty ugly outside tonight). In our leftover bag our waitress put in there an entire loaf of bread for free...talk about wonderful customer service!",

    "text": "My parents were in town and since my Mom's birthday is next week we decided to go out for an early celebration.  I now live in Bloomfield so we decided to go Italian.  Full disclosure:  my first choice was D'Amico's but either they changed their storefront and I didn't recognize it, or they have closed.  In any event, my plan B was Alexanders.  We went on a Tuesday night around 7.  Parking was no problem, free street parking after 6-nice!  The bar was deserted and the small dining room had two or three small groups.  So no shouting to make yourself heard-double nice!  The seating was comfortable (we got a square table in the middle of the room).  Our server was very nice and efficient and I'd give her at least 4 stars.  My mom got the spinach and cheese ravioli w/ marinara sauce (on the menu the ravioli are deep fried but they honored her request for a \"normal\" cook), my dad got angel hair with bolognese sauce, and I got linguini with pesto sauce.  I was surprised that the pasta dishes did not come with a salad so if you go, that's additional.  The server said that the serving sizes were generous.  They were good portions but not huge by Pittsburgh standards.  My mom does not have a large appetite and she ate all but one ravioli.  I ate all my pasta and could have had more.  My Dad was reaching for his third slice of bread after he polished off his pasta, so I'll let you draw your own conclusions!  :)  The sauces were good and the pasta tasted like it was fresh.  Everything was warm/lukewarm, but not steaming hot.  I'm a bit of a slow eater, especially with pasta so by the time I was finishing, it was cold.  The food was OK, in cases like this, I really wish you could give a half star, because this is 3.5 stars.  Nothing was horrible, nothing was excellent.  It was good.  The bill with a tip was around $55 (we all had soft drinks), which again I don't have a major quibble about.  Not sure I will go back, but not sorry I went.  :)",

It doesn't compare to your top-rated traditional Italian joint because that's not what it is. It's really more of an unpretentious mom and pop spot, with consistent hearty meals. Great stop for lunch or dinner, and cozy family atmosphere.  We ate, we laughed, and had a very relaxed meal with coffee and dessert at the end. Drinks were refilled seamlessly and leftovers carefully packaged. Would definitely come by again!",

It was a nice lunch but nothing to rave about. I had a meatball hoagie, which was very tasty. My son had buttered noodles and it was a great size for a kid. He got a kids milk served in a to go soup cup with a kid. I'm having bad luck finding a place with a proper kids cup. Kind of annoying. My friends both enjoyed their meals of the Gorgonzola burger with bacon and the Gorgonzola pasta. Unfortunately, we were seated right next to the bathroom. I hate when places do that if there are spots closer to the front. I guess that's what happens when a kid is with you, I don't know. I probably won't go again, but it was decent for one meal.",

We all tasted everyones dishes and we couldn't find a winner.  All were so delicious.  At the end of the dinner, we all grabbed our to-go bags.

It was completely empty except for two other parties. They bring you bread and oil to the table. We also ordered bruschetta which was very good. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals.   Beware of the pasta Diablo! My dad was sweating from the heat of it and he normally loves spicy food. He said it was delicious, but it sounds like a great dish for someone prepared for some serious spice (not me!). My little brother was disappointed that his spaghetti and meatballs came with one meatball, but besides that we were very happy with the meal. Nice portions and great service.",

Very good classic Italian-American food served in huge portions. It's a casual place, with patrons next to us enthusiastically watching football. Alexander is clearly a hands-on owner; we noticed him staying on top of the staff throughout the night, and kindly helping someone who seemed to be an elderly regular patron navigate their way out the front door after their meal. Alexander chatted with us after we ate, asking if everything was satisfactory. When we asked if desserts were made on site (specifically, were the canolis pre-filled, which they are not), he offered us two, on the house! I'll return next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "So a friend and I went to Alexander's because it was the closest restaurant to his place and we didn't feel like driving on the snow-covered roads.  I didn't have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!  The decor and ambiance isn't upscale but it also isn't terrible.  It feels like a down home, mom and pop type of restaurant.  It sort of reminded me of a place that Tony and his crew would eat at in \"The Sopranos\" - good food and cool ownership.  When we entered, it looked like the owner was chatting it up with some regulars.  Seeing us, he warmly greeted us and introduced us to our waitress.  Before I get to the food a note on the service.  Our waitress was great - super friendly, helping us with any questions, and checking up on us during our meal just enough to feel taken care of but not intrusive by any means.  I could tell this wasn't her first rodeo.  The food was spot on.  Along with our menus, we got a basket full of fresh Italian bread and butter.  The bread was standard white but it was moist and tasted very fresh.  But you know how it is - don't fill up on bread!  Perusing the menu, they had a lot of variation which I love - chicken marsala, spaghetti, etc but the chicken parmigiana sandwich was calling my name.  It came on hearty bread strong enough to hold the sandwich and not fall apart.  The best part was the chicken which was crispy!  It came with what tasted like homemade sauce and cheese.  It's a simple meal but very tasty - you bite into it and first get the slightly sweet sauce and cheese then the hearty chicken.  Mmmm.  The sandwich was around $9 and it came with fries.  A very good and hearty meal.  I look forward to trying some of the other options at Alexanders the next time around!",

It took me 45 min to get their from SHills by access van but I used to live in Shadyside and would walk to Alexander's in the cold snow for Their pasta!

We loved the atmosphere- the dining area has a very cozy feel to it.  The area is small, so the tables are close together.  The only drawback of this was that we couldn't help but overhear the conversations at neighboring tables.    I liked the menu, they had many classic dishes and also a make-to-order pasta section.  My parents have simple tastes, so this suited us very well.  All choices were reasonably priced.  I ordered penne pasta with \"marfredo\" sauce- a blend of marinara and alfredo.  It was delicious, and came in a very large portion.  My mother ordered the chicken parm and she claims it was the best she's ever had.  All in all it was a good dining experience and I'm happy that we found this place.",

I knew he was a keeper when we ordered the asparagus/goat cheese appetizer and I loved it so much that he let me eat all but one piece on my own.    There is a bar areas out front that has a more casual feel and dining room in the back.  The dining room is small and intimate offering several booths along the sides of the restaurant and several tables in the middle and towards the front of the dining room.  The decor has a homey feel with nice colors and a fun chandelier.  The menu is much more extensive then a typical Italian restaurant.  There are several appetizer choices in addition to the previously mentioned grilled asparagus.  There are also several salads and two soup options, the soup of the day and wedding soup.    The first time I was there I tried the veal diablo which was veal with hot peppers and mushrooms and a Marsala sauce.  It was delicious.  It had a nice kick but wasn't too hot that you didn't enjoy it.  On my second visit I enjoyed the \"pastabilities\" create your own pasta.  With 10+ sauce choices plus 10+ pasta the combinations seem endless!  I enjoyed the angel hair with the Marsala wine and red pepper sauce.  My husband had the Bolognese and was equally happy.  The pasta seemed to be in an endless bowl.  I felt like I was eating forever and there was still two meals worth of pasta left in my take out container.  The build your own pasta is quite a value for the price (although it does not come with a soup or salad like the other entrees do).    We were stuffed, but after seeing several desserts go by, I decided I wanted to order the Napoleon.  It was stuffed with strawberries and blueberries and the cream was delectable.    Overall a great dining experience.  We will be back.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, excellent service, & fantastic food! I wanted to try out a local Italian restaurant for my birthday and I couldn't have made a better choice. Being vegan, I normally do not go to many Italian restaurants because there are not many options. Alexander's has a pastabilities section on their menu that is perfect for any picky eaters or people with food allergies (they also have gluten free pasta!). I ended up ordering the malfalda Madison without feta and added broccoli to it. It was to die for! The perfect Mediterranean primavera that I was craving. Because everything is homemade, basically everything on the menu is customizable and my waitress was extremely nice about it. The portion was overwhelming for the price, I had lots of leftovers to take home. I ended my meal with espresso and they even gave me a loaf of bread to take home! I could not be more pleased with this restaurant. The owner and manager were both there, wished me a happy birthday, and could not be more kind. I will most definitely return to this little gem on Liberty ave!",

I totally regret having passed this place up!  The problem is, this place is across from Silky's which I know and love, and based on the exterior I assumed this was a very expensive restaurant geared towards the 50+ crowd.    It *is* nice inside, but when we dined here I was in sweat pants and not an eyebrow was raised.  Full disclosure:  I was dying at the end of a long urban hike, and we were right next to Alexander's and I told my friend I would hate him forever if he did not buy me pasta RIGHT.NOW.  :)    Alexander's totally hit the spot.  It was so good!  I was really surprised!  I had the chicken bruschetta and it was DELCIOUS.  I'd had the same item at Del's a few weeks ago and Del's cannot hold a candle to Alexanders.  My chicken breast was only slightly seasoned which is a sign of a good, confident chef.  The chicken was delicious and perfect and came out tasting like well seasoned chicken, not salt.  It came with a side of pasta in any sauce I wanted from their lengthy list of sauces.  I chose penne in gorgonzola cream sauce.  The gorgonzola sauce was extremely strong.  VERY cheesy.  I like gorgonzola, but it was a bit strong for me--although it was still very good.  My friend had a spaghetti and marinara in the marinara was incredible.  You can tell its made on site.  It was excellent.    Our entrees came with side salads which were very good, and there was bread nad oil on the table for dipping although we didn't get into that too much.  I will def be back, and if you havent tried alexander's, I recommend it.  Its good, and you're not going to go broke eating here.",

There are very good reasons why Del's is gone and Alexander's is still here.   The pesto and the bread (both made fresh every day) are my favorite parts and are definitely crave-worthy. The grilled asparagus is also quite impressive given how simple it is, but I'd agree with Pepin in saying that the best food is ordinary things prepared extraordinarily well. I'm an epicurean 23 year old with Italian grandmothers so I think I have an idea of what's good.  Alexander's is good for dates, family dinners with just the right amount of class, and people who like good bread.  Alexander's is not good for sea urchin crunching, small-batch moonshine sipping, mise-en-place modernists. There are nice places like Lawrenceville and Umi for you.",

We were greeting as soon as we walked in and the host say is immediately-impressive for 6:30 on a Friday evening. We ordered the fried zucchini, which came with marinara sauce. Absolutely amazing!! Best marinara I've ever eaten. There is a page in the menu of mix-and-match pastas with sauces. I got the tortellini with pesto and my mother got the gnocchi with red pepper sauce. The pesto was more like an Alfredo sauce with pesto in it. Although not what I expected, it was amazing. The red pepper sauce was sweet and tangy, a little different but still very enjoyable. All of the courses came out quickly- we were there for less than an hour. Our waiter was very nice and frequently refilled our waters. Overall, amazing experience and I will be returning next time I am in Pittsburgh.",

It was exactly what you want in fried zucchini.  The zucchini was nice and thick and the breading was thin, crispy, and light.  The accompanying tomato sauce was thick and perfect.  For our main dishes I got the fried ravioli with tomato sauce and meatball.  My fiance got linguine with a tomato, garlic, basil sauce.  The fried ravioli were crispy and the perfect amount and the sauce was nice and thick and clung to the pasta.  The meatball was good, not the best, not the worst, just a good meatball.  My fiance's dinner was perfection.  I kept stealing the tomatoes which were completely infused with the garlic and basil.  We ended with the tiramisu which was the perfect end to dinner. The decor and atmosphere is so cozy and everyone makes you feel so welcome.  The prices are very reasonable and all in all we truly enjoyed ourselves, the food, and the wine.",

    "text": "Alexander's is good, solid Italian food without any pretentiousness. Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).  I've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.  I ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.  The pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.  Somewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.  If you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's. Just stick with the pasta, and you'll be happy.",

Wedding soup was a bit salty, but otherwise perfectly fit my conception of what wedding soup should be.  Dad had the tortilla soup (I know; odd choice) and he liked it quite a bit.

    "text": "I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes!   On Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.  The manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)  The dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!  After enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.  Towards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!  He was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS!   BTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.  The manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages.   He SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even.   I am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.  The manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \"LOOKING COMFORTABLE\" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.  He also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't True, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees.   THE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends.   This is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!  SCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!",

The overall quality of the food seems to have gone downhill, with less emphasis on traditional Italian cooking. Some of our pasta was underdone (not al dente), and the seasonings were on the bland side. An exception is the turkey Devonshire, which isn't exactly Italian, but is a Pittsburgh original.  I wouldn't go back for Italian entrees, but it was the overpriced and underwhelming salad that was so bad I had to write about it.  After ordering our entrees, the waiter asked if we would like soup or salad. I chose a Caesar salad, assuming that this was included in the price of the entree, as it is at most restaurants. I don't mind paying $7 for a salad, but I like to know that I'm paying for it, and this Caesar salad was not worth $7. It wasn't even a Caesar salad. It was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with Italian dressing. If I had known I would be charged for it, I would have asked for Parmesan cheese and maybe some anchovies.",

For those math geeks, that's $2.71 per piece of mushroom filled ravioli. Not some foraged mushrooms down in the allegheny mountains, just straight from giant eagle. Average restaurant that feels the need to overcharge and under deliver on food. Wasn't my first choice and I won't be back again. I don't like to do this but this experience was so terrible on many levels I can't ignore it. And yes, Sunday night blah blah blah. Regardless, pay a little attention and don't grossly overcharge for average food.  DO NOT EAT HERE.",

It was average but considering it cost $28 for chicken Parmesan with a third-party ordering system I was not too impressed because the quality was just average. I asked for spaghetti with my chicken Parm but I received a penne and the sauce was just tossed on top of bare pasta so I had to mix it up when I received it.  I am glad I also asked for crush read and Parmesan cheese because the marinara sauce was very bland similar to Classico tomato sauce out of the jar.   I wonder how the other dishes are but likely wouldn't reorder again.",

No one at the bar or seated in front at 6PM, never a good sign.   PROS:  Can't think of any, honestly.   CONS:  Rude service...probably the mother or grandmother/owner waiting tables. Incredibly unfriendly and rude as she took my plate away before I was finished and didn't even ASK if I was done. Food came out in literally 2 minutes, which tells me most of it is pre-cooked and not fresh...it tasted like that too.  Bland and boring...a disgrace to True Italian cooking...like the \"chef\" or someone has completely given up.  Prices way too high for microwaved pasta...$20+ per person. Everything reminded me of a \"Kitchen Nightmares\" episode as I half expected Gordon Ramsey to pop out from the back.   WILL I EVER RETURN?  Nope. Never. With so many amazing new restaurants out there who are innovative and hungry for business, why would you bother beating a dead horse here?",

Anything positive ends with \"charm\", when you enter that back dinning room your nose is greeted with all to familiar scent of piss, like really old piss, that's been festering for a couple days...just imagine pee'ing and not flushing the toilet, like ever.   I got the spaghetti and meat balls with Angel hair and sauce. The spaghetti was over cooked, the sauce had a heavy dose of dried parsley and meatball had zero flavor. I actually didn't know meat could could achieve that level of bland. It's was $17, they charged me $2 per meatball, and $13 for the pasta.  My daughter got a side of angel hair (they have no kids menu, because this is a place for adults, really old adults who haven't the slightest fucking clue how too eat) pasta with butter, $6.   They give u a basket of bread that's about 5 minutes from being a crouton.  This place is like Del's, out dated with a complacent owner(s) who don't give fuck or just don't get It, luckily they should be out of business within the next two years.",

The overall atmosphere was great and I really enjoyed being there.  The issue I had was with the food and that seemed to be the consensus of the group I was with.  I got the Calamari Fritti, a guy in my group got the Chicken Parm, and another got the Tortellini Verde.  We all agreed that the food was kind of bland.  The guy with the tortellini said the noodle itself was good but the sauce was disappointing.  The calamari on my fritti was cooked well but again the batter was bland.  The sauce on the dish was marinara but to me it just seemed like unseasoned diced tomatoes.  I'm definitely willing to give this place another chance.  Another guy in the group had the lobster ravioli and said it was good so it's possible some things on the menu are just better than others",

    "text": "Recently moved to Pittsburgh from Brooklyn, NY.  Do yourself a favor, don't even try this place.  FOOD: Terrible.  The pasta was definitely double boiled/precooked.  Extra soggy on the outside and whatever on the inside.  Fiance had the penne vodka sauce or comparable, and it had an off taste, and one I can't even describe.  Maybe it was the asparagus that overpowered the sauce.  I had a regular pasta and meatball dinner.  It was more of a marinara with way too much olive oil.  I work at a hospital and the cafeteria pasta I had the day after was 100x better than the food at this place.  It was just so bad, I really have nothing good to say about it.  ALCOHOL: We only had wine.  You really can't mess that up because it comes pre-bottled.    PRICE:  Way, way, way over priced for the garbage food they serve you and the dirty, old atmosphere you're eating in.  We left there, after 1 appetizer, 2 pasta dishes (1 w/ meat), and 2 glasses of wine, with a $70.00 bill.  Are you serious?   ATMOSPHERE/CLEANLINESS:  Dirty.  Old.  Poor music choice for an Italian restaurant.  The owners need a make over of this entire place.  Call in Chef Ramzy.  No, really... call him.   The space has potential, but wont make it at this rate.  The carpets are so dirty, I would hate to see what the kitchen actually looks like.  If the venue can't maintain the dinning room cleanliness I would hate to see what behind the scenes looks like.   SERVICE:  If it wasn't for our waiter's great personality, He did keep us laughing, and very entertained.  Punctual with our food and drinks.  Overall, good service experience.  But if it wasn't for the service, I wouldn't have even given this place 1 star.  Oh wait... we can't give lower than this.",

Then, we walked outside to call an Uber and someone ran in to pick up a to go order. 1) If he is going to lie, he should stick to one lie--not vacillate between two closing times.

The food was really good, desserts were great. We got four desserts and had a long debate over which was best...really, they were all delicious.   To top it off, they get fresh bread daily and had some extra loaves. We left with leftovers and a fresh loaf in hand.

We were able to get a seat with ease, keeping in mind it was the weekend before the holidays and we were doing a later dinner.  We were seated in the back dining room. It's a flashback to the past in a comforting way, with Fiesta plates. We ask for the drink menu and see a variety of wine and beer options. The wines don't list the vineyards, so it was difficult to discern. The beers included a good number of local crafts.  The specials include entrees and salad or dessert. It was a bit more food than we wanted, so we opted for the traditional menu. The seafood Devonshire caught my eye as did the veal diablo. Hubs was curious about the make your own pasta but at the mentioned of the veal diablo and options paralysis, he knew what he wanted.  We ordered and the waitress was helpful with the wine selection, noting the Chanti hubs ordered was on the sweet side, so he was able to swap it out for the dryer option. The food comes out within a reasonable time and it piping hot. The waitress realize she forgot our bread and brings it out, very much needed with the amount of sauce in out entrees. The veal diablo is delicious. I took a bite and was wowed by the spicy flavor. The seafood Devonshire is creamy and rich. The tart/pie crust was fluffy. The crab meat is imitation, so keep that in mind.  Overall solid meal, good service, and large portions. It was a bit pricey for a neighborhood spot.",

    "text": "Good Food. Outstanding Service. A Classic.   Alexander's is an old-school family restaurant/pub in all the best ways.  The three of us (me, my wife and our son) arrived to a crowded restaurant that seemed to be filled with people who know each other. People hugging, laughing and talking. I assumed they were all together but it became clear that it was staff talking with various regulars - everyone seemed in a great mood.   We sat and before we even had a chance to look at the menu our son was asked if he would like a plate of his own little meatballs. He was super excited about this idea. We were off to a great start.   I ordered the chicken parm with a side of pasta.  My wife had wedding soup with a make your own pasta combo.  The kiddo went with buttered noodles with sauce on the side and the aforementioned meatballs.   Everything was quite good. My chicken was crispy, but flavorful and the sauce was well seasoned.   The real star of the meal was the Marfredo sauce - a combination of alfredo and marinara sauce. Its crazy delicious. I had it on my pasta side, the wife had it on her meal.   Our son ended his meal with a bowl of ice cream and my wife and I split the Tiramisu. The tiramisu wasn't a traditional slice but more of a parfait. It was quite good. A lot of tiramisus are either drowning in brandy or the coffee flavor is overwhelming - this blended them both wonderfully.   But while the food was good, the service was simply outstanding. Attentive, friendly and knowledgable staff.  Give Alexander's a shot when you're in the mood for an old-school high-quality Italian meal.",

    "text": "Little Italy Days- a MUST see when in Pittsburgh. Rather than eat the so-so food on the street though, my friend & I decided to have a late dinner at Alexander's for a delicious Italian dinner. We ordered the chicken parm with angel hair pasta and marinara and split the portion between the two of us. We also had a side salad, the wedding soup, and some bread with our meal, as well as a glass of chardonnay. The salad was delicious and we received a generous portion as a side salad. The bread was delicious and fresh, the wedding soup was divine and the chicken parm was incredible. Even with splitting one dinner portion between the two of us, we still went home with leftovers. It was delicious! Service was wonderful as well. You can't go wrong with Alexander's! Highly recommend!",

The first time (2016), we had lunch and ordered an Alfredo with Penne. It was creamy and flavorful, an Alfredo I preferred. The only reason I didn't go back was because I was a student and I wanted to eat veryyyy cheap and save some greens in my pocket. :P  The second time (2018), we got dinner. We ordered some Fried Ravioli which had a good crispiness and a soft filling. It was served with a hearty Marinara sauce. I also got an Angel Hair Pasta with Marsala Wine sauce, mushrooms and roasted red peppers. The taste was just the right amount of savory to keep eating forever. Mostly a toned down tanginess and a little black pepper, along with he hint of sweetness from the roasted red peppers.   I paired this with a glass of Australian red wine that I don't currently recall (it was a new one on our server's recommendation). But I remember it being a good recommendation.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want a good Italian dining experience for a reasonable price! :)",

I assume it's been in business for some time, judging from the photos on the wall, etc. Surprisingly the server was not well informed to guide us. She must have been new and seemed not to have tried the dishes on the menu. There is a full range of pasta dishes where you can match the type of pasta and choose from a number of sauces, but the sauces were bland. The garden salad was unremarkable. Pittsburgh has so many good restaurants that there is no reason to go out of your way for this one, which we chose because it was near our hotel.",

It's really hit or miss these days with an emphasis on miss. And that makes me really sad. My friends and I used to drive in from the suburbs in our early 20s for the amazing dishes they served. Now that I live a block away it's such a disappointment. It makes me wonder what's happening to Little Italy. No idea if or when I'll be back. #sosadaboutit",

    "text": "Alexander's is certainly a charming restaurant. It has a lovely patio and a nicely decorated inside (the bar in particular is the best feature.  We arrived early, before the rest of our party, and decided to have a drink at the bar. The happy hour drink deals are pretty great, so we got a glass of Cabernet for $5 (and BOY was it a heavy pour!). The bar tender was nice as can be, helped us choose our wine, and even brought out little crunchy snacks for us to eat with our drinks.  Our party arrived and we sat at our table in the bar section (happy hour deals still apply in this section!). Bread is immediately brought out along with two types of olive oil and cups of grated Parmesan cheese. The pesto-infused oil is tasty, especially mixed with some parm, but honestly the parm is almost tasteless, and the bread is a crusty, thickly cut, white bread that's just not that great. It was also served with butter packets which are just a bit tacky for me.  We ordered two appetizers for the table: the \"greens and beans\" and the \"fried zucchini.\" The greens and beans are absolutely delicious (garlic, white beans, spinach, tomatoes, olive oil). The fried zucchini was nondescript and the marinara that came with it was bland.  For my main course I ordered the tortellini with the Gorgonzola cream sauce with broccoli. The portions are huge, so you'll definitely have leftovers (no complaints). The broccoli was underdone, however, which was disappointing. The sauce was also quite bland, which was surprising considering the base should be Gorgonzola cheese. So I had to douse it in hot pepper flakes to give it a real taste. The manager is extremely welcoming and kind, always ready to be on the floor greeting and making sure things are ok; he's a great guy and is genuinely trying to better the place. When a friend of mine sent his dish to be boxed, however, it was thrown away instead because someone in the back thought it was overdone and assumed my friend wouldn't want it. We were told after the fact that it was thrown away and taken off the bill. Honestly it should have been spotted immediately if it was overdone, and not thrown away without asking the customer.. That was a disappointment.  I will be back, because I'm truly rooting for this restaurant, but I hope that next time I'll see some changes (bread, please!).",

It was 2 chicken breasts in a light alfredo sauce with peaches, grapes and pistachios in  very light sauce.An extraordinary vegetable medley was steamed with just the right seasoning. Within  2 week period, I ordered this entree with much exhilaration. Then, with much expectation, I ordered the Filet Medaions with portabella mushrooms Sicilian style with garlic butter and a side of pasta. The sauce was light  and enticing.The weekly specials come with soup or house salad, outstanding Italian bread and a delicious Tiramisu dessert.It is the Best Deal in town for only $26.Alexander's is well worth a visit.Lucky to have this family run restaurant in Pittsburgh!!!",

Pasta dishes were an average of $15 and didn't even come w/ a house salad.  They did come w/ soup? however, we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning.  All of the pasta dishes my party ordered as well as the  entree salads were mediocre (chicken looked like it was processed?) and didn't have many of the ingredients that were outlined on the menu.  And, to top the night off, I got sick off of mine and was up all night w/ indigestion.  UGH!!

They also offer a side house salad which is also really good (they use dried cranberries and candied walnuts, mmmm!!!). I'm not a huge fan of wedding soup, but Alexander's has one of the best.The mac n' cheese is fabulous as well. Everything here is. Nothing is done cheap. The atmosphere is dimly lit and romantic, I suppose, the bartenders are sweet and conversational, and the servers are timely, polite and very friendly. They have outside seating available, weather permitting. Decent drink specials and a variety to choose from. Alexander (the owner) is such a nice guy, he goes out of his way to make the customers happy. I feel like I'm at home here.

The dining room is small and decorated to look like an Italian trattoria. The menu has all the basics, tons of pastas, different sauces, meatballs, parmigiana, etc. The bread is from (I'm pretty sure) Mancini's which is an old Italian-American bakery in the city. Come as you are: jeans, Steelers jersey, college sweatshirt, what have you. The service can be a bit flaky, but everyone is quite nice. Just relax. If they mix up an order they'll make it right. I love the wedding soup here and they make awesome chicken piccatta. I also like how they serve the meat and pasta dishes separately on small plates, instead of dumping everything together on a big dinner plate. For dessert they make a real tiramisu with lots of rum, and also really good rice pudding. One warning: it is really easy to overeat here. I eat lightly during the day if I know I'm going to Alexander's for dinner.",

As it turned out, the service and meals were a disaster. In fact, I have not seen service that bad in years. We ordered the \"make your own pasta\" and the meals were unlike anything I have ever seen from an Italian restaurant. Not only were the dishes not correctly prepared based on the order, but bland and something you might see from a frozen microwave dinner. The waitress and general manager were lost with how to make things right. They were fumbling idiots who made no effort to suggest or substitute the meals. I was not impressed with the management and staff. We literally scavenged what we could from our meals, paid the check and got out of there. How many times have I left an Italian restaurant hungry? 2-14-2011 was the first time. Beware of this place, its not the same as it was back a few years ago.",

    "text": "I'm kinda sad to see any bad reviews of Alexander's on here. But come on people, who can actually write a review of an ITALIAN restaurant when they've only eaten the tuna or a hoagie? PASTA is in their name, so you should probably try the PASTA before commenting on something that isn't their SPECIALTY. Sorry for the sarcasm. I've been going to Alexander's for years, and I can't remember ever getting a bad meal. I love that you can pick what kind of pasta you want, what sauce, and the toppings. My favorite is the marfredo sauce. It is spaghetti sauce mixed with alfredo sauce. So freakin good!!!  My only \"issue\" is that they never seem to add enough sauce on your pasta, but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring you a little bowlful. It's perfect!!! I get hot sausage on top (which isn't too spicy) and broccoli (which is always steamed just right, so it's not limp).  The bread always comes with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in. I love that.   We always get a carafe of their Chianti. It seems to go really well with the pasta.  And lastly, the price is right. Why pay $20 for a plate of pasta? Alexander's agrees. With wine and 2 dinners, we get outta there for under $50. Not bad. This is an all-around good italian restaurant. Sorry to the haters, but this place blows Joe Mama's outta the water!!!",

    "text": "I went there recently with my family, and the food was good overall, but the service was rude.  Upon arriving there, we asked if there was a place to hang our coats, and were told it's \"a little hard to get to\"; and that was it, so we crammed them into our booth.  Corkage fee was charged for the wine we brought (since the wine list is practically nonexistent), which we completely expected and appreciated that we could bring our own wine; but our waiter took the cork out of the bottle and set it down on the table and walked away. WOW.  For $10 per bottle, maybe he could have actually poured it into our glasses?  The restaurant ran out of bread that night, we were told.  The salad came with the dressing in disposable plastic cups on the side. Really?   I think Eat N Park has a better dinner salad than this!  Most Italian bistros ask if you'd like ground pepper on the salad, but this wasn't an option, so it was pepper from the shaker on the table.   We had one dessert for a birthday in our group, but our waiter never asked anyone else at the table if they wanted to order dessert or coffee.  Since the appetizers and entrees were good, I may give 'em another chance, maybe for lunch, but I am truly blown away that Alexander's was Post-Gazette's Reader's Choice Award winner for Best Italian in 2008, which is very proudly displayed in several places.",

    "text": "Living in Bloomfield, I was excited to finally try some authentic, excellent Italian fare. Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.  We stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.  Mr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.  We got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.  Only downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.  Alexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.  We'll definitely be back.",

The 'senators peppers' which is an appetizer of sauteed peppers, garlic, EVOO, and tomatoes is really tasty and flavorful without being too spicy.  This is a pick your pasta then pick you sauce kinda place. Service is fine. House salad dressing matches the greens perfectly.  Alexanders is food allergy friendly and they have GLUTEN-FREE PASTA!  But this is not an over-the-top place, but then again, the prices are not over top either.  Recommended.",

You can buy make- your-own pastas and the tomato sauce is the best!!! The fried ravioli entree is really yummy too.  The only thing I can say as a semi-\"ehh\" about this place is that they don't have just a regular meat lasagna!  The appetizers are really good, but for instance if you order their provolone sticks, it only comes with three. Not exactly enough to share with another person. They give you complimentary bread to start though.  The Abby Alexandra's Angel Hair entree is very good as well. I should also mention that their proportions are huge! I always have leftovers no matter how hungry I am walking in.  All in all, this place is a gem. The people are soooo friendly and it's a really enjoyable environment to be in. Great for a casual drink, a nice dinner with your family or even a lo-key dinner date. The food is awesome and it's well worth a trip to this area of town if you don't live close.",

They give you an un-eatably huge portion which is fine by me, it makes a great lunch the next day. Also, I think the decor and prices make this a great spot for a date night.

The bread is fresh and is served with oil, vinegar, and parmesan cheese.  Traditional antipasto is delicious and made to suit the size of your party. For appetizers, the fried ravioli and calamari fritti are to die for. Entrees: the cream sauces, red sauces, and the pesto are all delicious but my favorite is the Marfredo Sauce, a mix of marinara and alfredo. The Marfredo goes really well with sliced spicy Italian sausage.  PS. The service cannot be beat. It's one of the friendliest restaurants I have eaten in.

I've heard very mixed things about this place, and after going in a couple of times for a happy hour I decided to get dinner one night. I didn't really know what to expect because the menu online listed dishes but no prices (as a side note: I HATE when restaurants do this!). I don't mind paying $15-20 for a good dish of food, but the quality of the pasta and sauces are totally average. I could boil a $1 box of pasta and $2 bottle of general marinara sauce at home and it wouldn't taste much worse than this food. It's definitely nice to go out for meals, particularly at a place like this that has such a well lit inside and a soothing vibe- however, I simply didn't think the quality of the food was good enough for the type of restaurant it strives to be. Furthermore, I found the people who work there to come off as a bit pretentious about the food and drink selections. In general, I would say the food and staff are a bit off putting and I wouldn't recommend this place to friends who have never been here before. However, if you go, definitely try the happy hour, which is one of the better ones in Pittsburgh *half off appetizers and drinks. Plus, wine is half off on Mondays and Wednesdays, which I would assume are their slower nights.",

They didn't go that extra mile to make it great. I had the blackened ahi tuna salad - the tuna was fantastic, but the dressing came in a plastic condiment cup with a lid and the tuna looked real lonely on some standard dark salad greens. Pasta portions were generous... but again, not fantastic. Joe Mama's actually has better pasta.   Half-priced wine by the glass - also generous. However there was lipstick permanently imprinted into the glass I got. The bar looks really nice and the dining room was more like a living room painted warm colors and filled with booths.   I really wanted to like it. But I also wanted to comment on how the stellar review from an unknown source underneath the glass table top to read while you dine made it feel like some substandard tavern. I wanted to tell the waitresses screaming across the dining room to quite down because I can't hear the strangely out of place pop and rock music coming from the quality sound system over her asking if her customers want coffee with the dessert.   I wanted a nice dinner at a beautiful restaurant. I got an OK one in a wonky dining room. If they take a step back and consider what they could do to make the place better, I think they can get there. However, that's not likely to happen without new management.",
