    "text": "Pretty decent place. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. My friends and I stopped by on a cold rainy night for a few burgers.   I felt like being semi-healthy so I ordered the rosemary goat cheese and apple burger but with a veggie patty. I regret ordering the veggie patty because it was not very good. It wasn't terrible, but I've had better. (Ex: kaya, stack'd, burgatory).   The cheese and apples were delicious, however. I definitely would order again, but with a regular burger!  For my side, I got the ginger broccoli. It is served cold, which I wasn't expecting. It was really good, though!  All in all, good place that I'd be willing to try again.",

    "text": "Great choice before seeing a show on the North Shore, and probably smarter than trying to get into Burgatory or one of the other places near the stadiums and Stage AE. We made it in time for happy hour, and they had solid specials going on. We tried the cured meat plate (half-off appetizers). Good selection (included some giant homemade pickles), and enough for 2-4 people to snack on. Draft beers were also $2 off. Our server was pleasant and attentive.   The burger by itself was good. A thinner patty than say, Tessaro's, but I don't think that's a bad thing. . . I was able to finish most of the burger. They grind their meat in house. I managed to find a little bite that wasn't smothered in candied jalapeno cream cheese and bacon, and the patty was really flavorful. I think their fancy pants cheese burger would be great because you'd get to taste the actual burger patty with fewer toppings.  Fellow reviewers did not steer me wrong. The candied jalapeno burger was very tasty . . . well-cooked bacon and, oh man!, that jalapeno cream cheese! It had a little bit of a spicy bite, but definitely not overwhelming. I'm going to have a hard time convincing myself to try other burgers when I go back. Also, the home fries . . . really good with some poblano peppers and onions, crispy but not burnt. I eat a lot of potatoes, and this is how I like my home fries.  First time at Benjamin's - will visit again!",

    "text": "After having tried a couple of their burgers at a yelp event, I was eager to come back with a couple of friends and working colleagues. I called ahead and reserved a table and because we were 10 people, they put us in a room in the back. Now, although it was bit off and out the way, it was not a problem at all for us. Our waitress was one of a kind and really friendly and always made sure we had everything. The reason I give them 3 stars is, because their burgers tasted nothing like the ones I had at the yelp event. I craved their Candied Jalapeno Bacon Burger, but unfortunately it was dry. The meat, the bread, everything. We had so many different kinds of burgers and one person at the table had a chicken Cesar salad. She did enjoy her salad, but the rest was really underwhelmed with what they got in front of them. Their beer selection is okay and also the food is okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.",

First trip, ever, for a specialty hamburger. Certainly will not be the last!  Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was just about full. Nice contemporary atmosphere. Very interesting selection of beer from the taps, bottles and cans... yes, cans. Had a little of each!  Burgers were excellent. Cooked exactly as requested. Sides were also very good. Slaw was not typical, much more creative.   Very good service from the server and bartenders.   Excellent French press coffee, and the pound cake with blueberries was one of the better desserts I have recently enjoyed.  We have already determined our selections for the next visit.   Never knew that hamburgers could be this good.  Oh, I should mention that, for a gourmet burger restaurant, no one has any attitude problems.  I have seen too many reviews about poor service with indifference at other places.   Benjamin's is a fairly new venue. Everyone works hard to deliver a good customer experience.   Great wine and beer choices. Great food. Great service. What else could you want? Sure, you can have that too: fair prices for a first-rate meal.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "BWAB is the latest edition to the burgeoning burger scene in the burgh'.  As such, I was intrigued to visit, and delighted for further development in the Northside.  The interior is cozy, and the brick above the bar is a nice touch. The rest of the interior doesnt really match it. This really seems to be a metaphor for the lack of congruence BWAB exhibits.   Ok, I get it, premium burgers justify a premium price in the ever recent trend of making pedestrian american fare into something more culinary. Some places have been successful at this.  As it stands now, I left with neither a positive or negative experience. That in itself, is a negative.   They are new, and as such, do not have drafts yet. They have a decent bottle/can selection of micro's. The menu is succinct, and you have the option of burgers. Good job, as I think menus exhibiting brevity are generally prefferred.  The list of burger options reads well, however the sides read like something akin to Denny's.   My girlfriend, as usual, ordered better (Goat cheese and apple burger), and I ordered the Bleu Cheese, Lardo, Green Olives, Pimento, Onion.  They did cook both of them to med-rare, which is one plus. The lardo was one giant piece, resulting in an inequality of distribution across the burger. The other ingredients were sparse and lacked the definition.  If you are trying to juxtapose different flavors, they should really all have an element of uniqueness to them.  The side, hash browns/home fries, looked like they came out of a frozen foods section.   If you want to justify your 11/plate price point, it is going to take a bit more than Orieda and some fancy toppings to win over my burger loving self.  I hope these are merely growing pains, but my girlfriend and I both left stating that we could probably construct a better burger ourselves.   This is not a problem unique to this restaraunt, but people tend to get wrapped up in the concept and skip the details. Sorry, but we yelpers notice this stuff.  If you are going to step up to Wingharts or Tessaro's, you better bring your A-game.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Benjamin's for a while now, and I had the chance to suggest it when I had dinner with friends last Friday.  It was a nice day and we were lucky enough to snag the last outdoor table which was great.  The place was pretty packed but not so bad that one would feel uncomfortable though it was getting more crowded by the time we left around 8:00 PM or so.  We go there in time for the tail end of happy hour plus they had their sangria on special, so I ordered that and we ordered the pretzels appetizer which was half off and which came with their candied jalapeno cream cheese and truffle mustard.  The pretzels were warm and soft but the star of the dish was the jalapeno cream cheese.  It was so good that I saved the little remaining bit to have with my burger.  The mustard that came with the dish was also great, but we were all clamoring for the jalapeno cream cheese, which made me wish that I'd ordered the burger that comes with it, but I will do that next time.    For our burgers 2 of us got the veggie burger which was honestly close to the best veggie burger that I've ever had in my life.  I will definitely go back there.  I got the Buffalo Blue burger with the veggie patty and overall, the sauce must have gotten soaked into the veggie burger because it was completely dry and hardly there so and had very little buffalo sauce flavor, I was happy that I still had some of the jalapeno cream cheese, but the burger itself was tasty.  My friend got the Goat Cheese and apple veggie burger and really liked it though she felt that the amount of shredded apple on top was excessive (it was) and took at least half of it off.  Her husband got the fancy pants with beef burger and he enjoyed it.  My friend and I got the broccoli salad as our side dish and while it was okay I felt like the broccoli was way overcooked to the point where it was kind of too mushy so I really didn't enjoy that.  My friends husband got the potato salad as his side, and said that it was fine, but nothing great.  So, overall we really did enjoy our burgers and appetizer and will definitely go back, but we may try different side dishes and options the next time and maybe it will hit 5 stars.",

I stopped in for brunch last weekend with the intent of having a bloody Mary, only to end up having breakfast and two drinks. First off, Jaime at the bar is a really great server. She's attentive, outgoing, and friendly. She's the type of person that wants you to enjoy yourself and will make sure you do - so props to her. For breakfast, I enjoyed their rendition of lox and cream cheese. Instead of being served with a bagel, it came with two thick slices of toasted marble rye bread. In addition to the bread, an assortment of toppings, including tomato, lettuce, and onion were served. Their jalapeno cream cheese is served on the side as is an aioli sauce (although I felt it was unnecessary). The bloody Mary bar was well stocked and clean. For the alcohol in my drinks, I opted  to try their house infused vodkas. Lastly, I enjoyed chatting with the two female cooks behind the counter. They were extremely friendly and interesting.   I really wish every time I went to Benjamins was as good as this experience.",

As for sides, I've had the \"curried cabbage cole slaw\" and the broccoli salad.  Both were delicious.  Their soft pretzels with truffle mustard were also very good.  There was a small issue during one of the visits, which is why this isn't a 5-star review.  My friends ordered soft pretzels that never arrived.  Well they arrived eventually, but only after reminding the server.  They received an apology from two staff members.  I'm also pretty sure they weren't charged for the pretzels.

I'm still hoping that they'll use real silverware soon, instead of plastic.  The interior is dark and cozy...and they need to bring some aspects of the restaurant up to snuff.  In addition to the silverware, get some decent real storefront windows - don't paint on your logo yourself.  Also, the music was somewhat strange.  Well, okay there was just one song that was of obvious questionable subject matter when in mixed company.  I was with my husband so I just cocked my head, said 'well that's an interesting song to hear at a restaurant'...but I'll tell you the old lady at the next table looked appalled.   Anyhow...the burgers were REALLY GOOD.  I'd definitely go back again for the burgers.  Juicy, perfectly cooked, seasoned just right.  Love it.  And they have hard cider.  Woot!",

You can see where the money went, it's got a chill, but beautiful vibe with a roaring fireplace, exposed brick walls, tons of great art, a friendly knowledgeable staff and a pool table and plush couches in the well styled back lounge.  The menu is broken up into 3 sections \"Not Burgers\", \"Burgers\" and \"Snacks\".  The specialty burgers are as creative as they are delicious, I got the MASSIVE fluffy apple and rosemary goatcheese \"fat boy\" 14 oz burger, and it was as tasty a burger as I've ever had.  Between Brgr, Burgatory, Tessaros and Winghearts, trendy gourmet burger bars are big in the burgh, and Benjamins brings a free spirited, unpretentious but high class twist to the game.  I ate at Benjamins Wednesday night, and I'm already enlisting friends to bring when I go back this weekend.  I'm not much of a wine connoisseur, and Benjamins has a nice wine list and very well stocked micro brew list to wash down their killer burgers.

The place wasn't busy so I don't know what was causing the delay. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers. We got the Cured Meats, Cheese Board, and the Pretzels. The Cured Meats had a nice selection, but the Cheese Board left a lot to be desired. There wasn't much to it and I didn't feel it was worth the price they charge. The Pretzels were tasty, the mustard was bold and flavorful, but the jalapeno cream cheese spread is what took the crown. It was absolutely delicious!",

Stood there and no one acknowledged us for about 2 minutes then I actually had to ask if we had to wait to be seated or do we seat ourselves. It seems as if the only waitress/hostess there was the bartender too so maybe someone called off that day.  I was told to wait to be seated, and we were. We were finally asked if we wanted something to drink but by that time we were wanting to get an appetizer. She walked off abruptly after taking our drink order so we didnt order an app. We ordered the good morning burger and another burger that had a burger patty and a lamb hot sausage patty. Although the burger was good, the lamb sausage patty definitely overshadowed the beef. If I went back Id just get the lamburger because it is amazing! It tastes like homeade Italian sauasage but the lamb just takes it another level! The home fries were really good.  Overall the service seems like it can be hit or miss and the burgers were pretty good. I feel like this place is a little pricey but Id go back just for the lamb sausage.",

As a side I opted for the curried slaw which was also very good and cut the unctousness of the burger.

Don't be afraid to get the burger a little less done, it's good fresh meats and the flavors compliment better somewhere between med-rare and medium.

The first time I ate there the service was fine and the burger was awesome. It was cooked properly, and the toppings were tasty, without taking too much attention from the meat.  The second time we had really slow service, and the burger was just slightly overcooked. Not a huge deal, but its not the type of inconsistency you want in a burger joint.  The third and final meal I ate here was by far the worst. Although the restaurant was nearly empty, the service was awfully slow. It took about 15 minutes to order, another 10 for the drinks to arrive, and another 20 after that for the food. Every burger at our table was overcooked, and not by a little. The toppings were still great, but an overcooked, flavorless patty means you're in for a bad time. What a bummer.   The servers and bartenders are super friendly, it's in a great location, the price is right, and the atmosphere is great. But when it comes down to it, the burgers are mediocre. A solid 'meh' rating.",

Toppings were very fresh, and the raw onions sweet with no bitter bite. It was served on a fresh roll that was very slightly sweet.    Sides of broccoli salad were very good but didn't go that well with the burgers. I would order a different side next time.  Draft beer selection was not extensive, but they offered tastings (poured more than fairly) and the beers they had were really good.  We did not have any issues that others mentioned with the service.  It was friendly and efficient even though they were pretty crowded.  A great stop for a great burger.",

    "text": "This is definitely a 4-star burger joint!   Ordered the soft pretzels, just to try out two dips that intrigued us - the candied jalapeno cream cheese and the truffle mustard. I was not a fan of the cream cheese because I don't like the heat, but my husband took it down! The truffle mustard was good, more of a finely-ground, stone-ground mustard that had a smooth finish. Smacked the sour and bitter taste buds all around!   Our meal was a split burger and side - the BBQ burger and the broccoli salad.   My thoughts on the burger: The first thing I noticed was the doneness; as I cut the burger in twain, the juices flowed into the lower bun and onto the plate. YES. This is a medium rare burger! Probably the first correct one I've had all summer! Next, the bacon.  Thick strips of bacon, not too over-peppered, and still with a bit of chewiness. Tasty.  The BBQ suave was on the savory side, most notably from the pepper, then what I think is a smidge of onion powder. All mingling together nicely on this fine burger.  The bun: surprised it wasn't toasted, but that is all.   Broccoli Salad: Boasting a soy-wasabi dressing, this chilled salad rocks the salty buds. It is truly covered with this sauce, assumably, it's been brining/marinating in it. Mostly soy sauce flavored, it didn't have the wasabi punch I was expecting. Good, nonetheless.   I suggest giving this place a try. My hubby and I are taking the afternoon to compare this and Bubba's in Bridgeville (both new to us). We'll let you know the winner later!",

I've never met a French fry I didn't love, but how refreshing to have some really good quality and different sides.  Personally, I recommend the Broccoli Salad.

    "text": "I stopped in here on my visit to Pittsburgh because I love a good burger & the place I stayed recommended this place.   The city I'm from has a ton of great burger places so I'm slightly spoiled. It was a great place to hang out, have a few drinks, eat, & shoot some pool.   Upon entering, I noticed the music immediately. Great music was playing that night. It made me want to dance while eating my burger. We were greeted & it smelled delicious. It's nice that this spot is next to a road to where you can watch people, dogs, & cars go by while you eat. Most burger places in my city don't have that.  For the appetizer we decided to have the Baked Brie (Brie, Granny Smith Apple Slices, Roasted Almonds, Wildflower Honey, Crostini). If I lived in the neighborhood, I could probably go here all the time to drink & eat baked brie the night away!   Looking at the burger menu, I was slightly overwhelmed. In my city, there are gourmet burger places, but most of them have 2 or 3 go-to burgers. This menu... Every single one of them sounded tasty! I decided to go with the Candied Jalapeno Burger (Candied Jalapeno cream cheese & apple wood smoked bacon). The burger was great. My only complaint is that it was a little dry. I normally order my burger medium so that it has pink & plenty of juice. It was still great... it just came out a little more on the medium-well to well side.  This place doesn't serve fries. Instead they have other sides along with Bacon Fat Home Fries(Onions & Poblano peppers). I wish places here in Louisville had that side!  Dessert choice... Brownie Sundae! We weren't able to finish it because we were so stuffed!  The last thing to mention with this place is the beer. Options on tap as well as plenty of cans, bottle, wines, & cocktails to choose from. After eating, we decided to play pool while I had a few more drinks. The staff there was great! I invited them to my city... yeah... when I drink a lot I tend to want everyone drinking & to have a good time with me. I hope I wasn't obnoxious. :-)  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Prior to catching Ghost B.C, at Stage AE, I found myself with time to squander, so to Western Avenue I hoofed it wielding a Just Pay Half Hot Card in search of a mighty burger.  As it turned out, Benjamin's no longer accepts the Hot Cards (thankfully, I had funds!), and while I've had mightier burgers, what Benny's is serving up doesn't run away from the likes Burgatory or Tessaro's either.   Freshly ground and hand-made daily, Benjamin's burgers are a compelling blend of sirloin, brisket (!), and short-rib (!!), creating beefy, bloody, smoky alchemy within mouths and a toasted Breadworks bun.   Benjamin's offers a number of burger builds as well as salad, snacks, and other types of sandwiches, but I created my own monster of brie, lettuce, tomato, onion, and bacon, shouting giddly \"IT'S ALIVE!!!\" as beads of jus rolled down my fingers upon first munch. Winghart's has a similar burger dubbed The Shipwreck, and it does not compare, my Benjamin's creation acting as the Kraken, pulling it down further into the depths of the ocean.   The housemade pickles put my taste buds in a trick as they accomplished something I never thought possible: The coins of cured cucumber were sweet, sour, and a little spicy simultaneously, causing my eyes to roll like a slot machine  as I bit into each jarred medallion.   The bacon fat homefries had an off-putting dryness to them, and despite what the menu said, I detected no lardy flavors in the underseasoned tuber cubes.  Nonetheless, I took in some of the Pirates game at the dark, wooden bar, one comfortably co-opted by locals, politely spurning the advances of tipsy middle-aged women as I conquered yet another Liberty Steak, pondering what a blasphemous North Shore Good Friday evening Papa Emeritus II had on the dimming horizon for this Catholic boy gone astray...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfWZQ9OvJ0_0&s=9c0b030f3b3a005a10d3b9fe3a42c77d3ed5b3a0ad58731be3ab5093d0f9bcd9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=fWZQ...</a>  P.S. The service was adequate overall even if it took some time for the bartender to warm up to me (he came off as a tad curt at first). He seemed to know all the other patrons, though.   P.P.S. Benjamin's is the brainchild of Paul Tebbets, formerly of the defunct wine bar known as Brix.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FP.P.PS&s=00a1a6cb3c19a43b0e6a30b8439a343505f043d41a4a4ae3ff4b51fc53017e5b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">P.P.PS</a>.

Being that it was my daughter's birthday and that she loves burgers as much as I do I figured that, that was as good a time as any to make a return visit.  Upon entering we were greeted and quickly seated in a booth next to the bar.  The wife and daughter both got a cream soda and I got a Coke. We started off with the Shrimp and Grits for our appetizer. (Byrd's Mill organic corn grits, habanero cheddar cheese, brown sugar and butter.) My daughter doesn't even like grits but, she loved these.  My wife and I both went with the Candied Jalapeno burger with pickles and lettuce and tomato and the birthday girl ordered a bbq, bacon cheese burger with lettuce and tomato. We patiently sat and watched in excitement as our Bacon Fat Home Fries (onions & poblano peppers) were being cooked next to the bar.  It was like Christmas morning as our burgers were brought all at once to our table. I am so glad I went with the Candied Jalapeno Burger! I ordered it medium and that's just how it came to me. It was super juicy and cooked perfectly! The freshly ground blend of Sirloin, Brisket & Short Rib was amazing and by adding the jalapeno cream cheese really makes the burger. It was so good! The Bacon Fat Home Fries were really good as well and complemented the burger to a tee.  My other complaint was the bun as it missing something. it could have been buttered or something. The house made pickles were great also.  Our waitress was perfect the whole night and never left my Coke or water glass get empty for long.",

After coming the first week of October and sampling a lot of Benjamin's signature items (shrimp and grits, candied jalapeno burger and the crab cake), I couldn't wait to return! My boyfriend is a huge burger fan so I knew I wanted him to experience this place as well.   We came on a Thursday night around 830. It was kind of busy and the bartenders were very busy, considering they were not only covering the bar but the table service as well. Our service was awesome, our server was super friendly and attentive to us despite how busy he was.   I ordered the candied jalapeno burger with a side of broccoli with wasabi sauce, a side salad and the curried coleslaw. My boyfriend ordered a traditional burger with fries and a side salad.   He liked his burger and fries but didn't feel as if it was anything out of the ordinary as far as your average burger goes. We both felt the side salad wasn't worth nearly $4. It was decent in size but the only toppings were soggy tomatoes, white onions and croutons. Nothing special. The curried coleslaw was disappointing- barely any curry flavor and the vinegar taste was overwhelming. The wasabi broccoli was alright, but I didn't finish it because the sauce was a little over powering. I'm giving this place three stars primarily because the candied jalapeno burger itself is that good. The sauce is amazing.   I don't think I'll be returning, unless I have an intense craving for the candied jalapeno burger.",

    "text": "If there's one thing I love, it's a good burger, and my goodness, based on the meal I had here Benjamin's knows exactly how to make a good burger!  I stopped in with a family member because we had a discount card for Benjamin's, but after our meal we'd come back whether we were getting the discount or not. I ordered a top shelf cheeseburger minus the onions and with a couple extra of my favorite toppings. And the burger I got was, well, really darn good! It was definitely not undercooked, but the dripping of juicy beef goodness that had me carefully eating over my plate the entire meal was a clear indication that it wasn't overcooked, either - and given my history of getting overcooked burgers, this was fantastic. My dining partner enjoyed one of their fall ales in addition to their burger, and the two things went together really well. I was admittedly way more focused on the yummy burger than the booze at that point.  I guess my only tiny complaint was that I had a little confusion with the menu, which led to me getting a spicy side dish with my food. So much of the menu includes a list of ingredients that you can choose from, that I didn't realize that ordering a side of broccoli would include all of the listed ingredients (which included wasabi) mixed together as a dressing. So I ended up eating a pretty spicy side of broccoli with my burger. It tasted just fine and now I know better for next time, but it wouldn't hurt if they clarified which parts of the menu were \"pick your ingredients\" and which ones weren't.  But overall, Benjamin's is definitely somewhere I'd eat again, and now it's on my top five places to grab a great burger in this city. My dining partner and I left feeling full and content. Can't wait to stop by again!",

To me, the burger was superior to what's offered at a lot of other Pittsburgh burger joints, including BRGR, Burgatory and Tessaro's.  I also ordered the pretzel appetizer, which also comes with the candied jalepeno cream cheese and mustard as dipping items. So tasty.  Unfortunately, the service left something to be desired. Service was sluggish, and seemed a bit short staffed. I was waiting for a friend for a little while. I was given a glass of water, but had to go to the bar to order my appetizer. Perhaps service issues were a fluke.  My hubby, a self-proclaimed food snob, devoured my leftovers when I got home. I'll definitely be back.",

After getting one employee's attention and asking where we can sit, we finally saw the sign for the tap room we were looking for and asked if we could go there. The employee we were interacting with asked us if we needed food menus, we said \"no, just in for a beer\" he said \"good\" (his tone was like thank god they don't need food menus). Once we went up to the taproom we sat ourselves at the bar, we were greeted by maybe the hostess, and given the food menu, taplist and cocktail menus then she left. So here it's the two of us and two other customers, the bartender was chatting with the one other customer (who just got off work at 412 Brewery a half block away where she gave us impeccable service). The bartender continued her conversation and drying bar glassware and never acknowledged us for about 4-5 minutes, two other employees popped in behind the bar, no acknowledgment.  The bartender walked past us twice and never made eye contact with us. At this point we left. Attention owner/manager we had money in our pockets that we wanted to leave in your hands, get your employees engaged with their customers and you will see the money come in. I have no time for poor service.",

Tuesday they have a burger, beer, and a shot for $11.95. For $1.50 you can upgrade from their classic burger to any burger on the menu. Cheap yuengling drafts and great service as well.   I almost always go with the candied jalapeno burger which has some kick and it always hits the spot. The jalapeno cream cheese on the burger makes it. The bacon fat home fries are the way to go with the sides, as their other ones really don't give you too much.   You can't beat the cheese board and meat board for snacking during happy hour, oh and the pretzels come with jalapeno cream cheese to dip.   I really like this spot, definitely a go to for HH in the North side!",

    "text": "I have put this off too long and for no good reason.  I. Absolutely.  Love.  Benjamin's!  Yes I love a burger restaurant that really doesn't have a kitchen and that operates without a deep fryer.  Why?  Probably because they have the best burger in Pittsburgh.  I am sure that statement can be met with disapproval, and I don't care.  These bar side made burgers are so good!  I have yet to have a burger cooked there that wasn't cooked incredible perfect and to my requested standards, seasoned wonderfully and was so full of flavor.   Their candied jalapeno burger served medium rare is my favorite and I get it every time I come.  I also really enjoy their shrimp and grits, actually the BEST shrimp and grits I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked grits, not hard or gritty, with a habanera cheese sauce, topped with broiled shrimp.  So delicious.  I need to point out that my first visit to Benjamin's was for a Yelp event last year.  I am so happy they had that event and I got to attend, because otherwise I don't think I would have ever tried this place.    Now since they lack any fryers and the kitchen is literally on the corner of the bar (IE the oven, prep, plates) their side dishes are all raw minus the bacon home fries.  I don't mind this at all, I prefer something a little healthier to go with my most likely 800 calorie burger, but I wish the sides were a little more inventive, and I wish they offered a salad as well.  Last time I tried the broccoli salad as my side.  Eh it was ok.  The broccoli was nice, crunchy, and vibrant but the sauce and other components lacked flavor.  I also had their pasta salad and potato salad.  The pasta salad was my favorite of the three but still wish there were some other options for sides.   I must also mention, they have a Brunch with a Bloody Mary Bar on Saturday and Sundays, and offer daily drink specials, on top of their Monday through Friday Happy Hour specials which you can get $2.00 off your draft choice.  Just a couple more reasons I love this place.",

The pretzels themselves were nothing out of the ordinary; however, the candied jalapeno cream cheese was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. The Fancy Pants was my burger of choice for the night, and it did not disappoint. The red wine braised onions were a welcomed change from the typical caramelized onions you find elsewhere. Regrettably, I opted for the pasta salad, which left me immediately wishing I had gone for the home fries. Oh well, there's always next time.   One unfortunate aspect of the dining experience was the flies traveling through the front doors and violating my personal space.

This was my first visit and though I was intrigued by the burgers, and some other menu items, I was craving  smoked salmon on the drive in this morning. As luck would have it, Benjamin's offers a pastrami style smoked salmon with brie, romaine, onion, tomato, dill aioli on a toasted wheat Kaiser roll. This sandwich is pared with a choice of side dish and who can resist wasabi and broccoli? Very nice, fresh broccoli florets, shredded carrots, and sesame with a light wasabi dressing. The menu pricing is slightly upscale and my lunch cost $13+ with no drink. I like water! Benjamin's does have a full bar and the atmosphere is very \"pub\" like which is to say that it is comfortable, the music was appropriately loud enough but not too loud for conversation at your table, there is a TV showing soccer, and the seating is fine. Tables w/chairs on one side and a long bench on the other.  I cant wait to try this place again. Next time I'll be checking out the burgers for sure!",

    "text": "First off, I wish I could give Benjamins an extra half star for excellent service and beautiful bathroom.  Seriously, the bathroom is spectacular and they handled our party of 11 like complete pros.    My problem is, the burger I had just doesn't stand up to others I've had in the city.  It's good, but nothing mind blowing.  I started my meal off with a side salad, which was a little odd because it had salsa on top.  It was a very tasty salad with good balsamic dressing, dont get me wrong, but definitely the first time I had salsa on a salad (and not much else).  I ordered the Top Shelf burger with Aged Cheddar cheese.  I got a side of home fries.  I added bacon and pickles to the burger.    The burger was big, with toppings piled high.  Not a bad thing, but I appreciate a bun that can handle a big burger, which this was not.  I ended up eating most of the burger with a fork and knife, and just picking out the bacon and eating it by itself (it was really good bacon).  The pickles were not standard dill pickles, but a sweet and spicy pickle which was OK, but not what I would have chosen.  The home fries were good, but let's face it, not french fries, which is what I think everyone wants instead.    I'll stress again how great the service was... they separated all of our checks without us even asking.  They were extremely attentive and friendly.  I would go back just based on this fact.  Great service like that is hard to find!",

It's nice because there is no wait and it's a very intimate atmosphere. I got a crab cake sandwich with a pesto pasta side, both of which tasted amazing. I'm not a fan of cold pasta, but whatever they did to this made it fantastic. My girlfriend got a burger with home fries, and they were both great as well. The kitchen is literally apart of the bar, and the guy who is cooking the food was 2 ft from us (if that). He is an amazing cook and should be given some serious props for the environment that he works in, as I could only imagine how high pressure it is. Overall, great place, nice staff, and most importantly amazing food.",

The veggie burger is a little different - sweet potato and chick peas but I liked it. The home fries are good too, but the best part of my lunch was the wasabi broccoli salad. It tasted like a broccoli sushi roll. I really like the two large widows in the front - lets a lot of light in and makes for an open air room when weather permits.",

    "text": "I love burgers so this isn't much of a stretch for me.  If you are looking for a casual dining experience, some nice cocktails, and cheap beer specials then I think Benjamins would do you well.   I keep my burgers simple (American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo), so I haven't strayed too much on ordering anything else.    I will say that the appetizers that we've order have left us a little wanting.  We did order the cured meat tray, which was billed \"as the best in Pittsburgh\", didn't quite live up to that.  Was good enough, but nothing to live up to that hype.  We also ordered the baked brie, which was tasty but didn't really have that much actual brie in it.  Soft pretzels however are great, as soft pretzels always seem to be.    Besides my burgers, in which I always order a double, my wife tried the roasted portobello sandwich and Rosemary-Balsamic Goat Cheese & Green Apple burger.  Both were adored.    The ambiance is great, it's cozy, and warm.  That does have it's downside though.  It can get crowded, and sometimes I do leave smelling a bit like the grill.   None of these negatives have stopped me from going back though, as I've been there 3 times in the last two months.",

Tasted great best burger so far in Pittsburgh.  Home fries a neat and different side option.  Well worth it especially when you compare to something like five guys (chain).  Inside it's a neat looking place with bar and sidewalk seating.  Not a big place so if see a line you will have a long wait. Also the kitchen is very small at end of bar.  We had a great experience and the price surprised me. Less than $12 a person for a burger and side.",

Overall I would eat here again in a pinch but would not be my 1,2,3 choice to grab a non- commercial burger place! No milkshake or tradition fries and that's because the kitchen is basically behind the bar! Again no distinguish flavor or homemade ranch or signature taste that says their name! Nothing that makes you have an addiction to and crave later! But perfect for this area that is without this kind of variety! Another thing! They had to turn down customers because they have only about 50 seating amongst 4 tables - so smaller couples have to sit at the bar - not cool!",

The pretzels were perfect. Warm and soft with mustard and jalapeno butter, yum. The broccoli salad was good, but needed to be cut smaller and seasoned more. In fact ever part of our meal was woefully under seasoned. The burgers especially under seasoned. They were cooked perfectly and piled very high with our preferred topping, but the buns were cold. Also the bacon fat home fries were just bland and no crispy bits, salt, pepper, or onions. The tested like greasy baked potatoes. I'll probably go again  I'll just ask for a salt shaker.",

They are known for their burgers, so if it is your first time visiting I highly recommend you check one of those out. I decided to opt for the Top Shelf Cheese burger was some cheddar. Being 8 months pregnant, I needed to make sure that I had no pink in my burger. Thankfully they were able to deliver on this request, as I did not need to send it back to the kitchen. They have several add ons available to those who want to build their own burger instead of choosing one of their pre-made options. The side salad I got was HUGE! They only have two options for dressings which was kind of womp, womp - but that was okay because it was super filling. The pesto pasta salad is a must for a side. If you head to this place in warmer weather, request a patio seat in the back! It is quaint and intimate - great spot to enjoy a dinner with friends or family!",

Don't come here if you are looking for something quick before a game. Definitely have some time to spend hanging out with your friends and having at LEAST 3 drinks before you get your food.

We came for the Tuesday special of a burger, bourbon and beer for 12.95. I upped my choice and got a specialty burger for 3 dollars more I believe.  I got the jalapeno cream cheese burger cooked medium. And thank you, it was cooked MEDIUM! Yay! Honestly the flavors were perfect. It wasn't very spicy so and the cream cheese was heavenly. I will say the sides are definitely lacking. My home fries were just eh, and they're cooked in bacon fat so I'd think they would be amazing.   We also had the meat board as an app, which was very good but for $11 I think it could have been a bit better.   I'll definitely be back!",

The tasting room looks amazing, they're bringing in local music, and they're promoting local beer. Jake and Abbey are doing it right. They've kept the old favorites, but are making small changes to make it their own. The only small critique is that I've noticed a couple of folks comment that the new chairs aren't designed for larger patrons. This is a great asset to the neighborhood.   PS check out the new sides... and grab a Kentucky Bourbon burger.",

    "text": "If you're going here for dinner, great choice. The burgers are amazing here; the Candied Jalapeno burger is my absolute favorite. It has a layer of their candied jalapeno cream cheese which is sweet, spicy and creamy. Amazing. They also serve this cream cheese with their pretzels, if you want to give it a try without committing to having a whole burger with it. If you're feeling extra hungry, get the My Morning Burger because it's huge. It has a whole breakfast on top of a burger: an egg, bacon and home fries. There really hasn't been a burger that I haven't liked here. As a side, the home fries are a great accompaniment to go with the burgers. The home fries are the way to go because the other sides I've tried (broccoli and cole slaw) aren't that great.   Although dinner is great here, I'm not sure I can recommend going here for breakfast or early brunch. The brunch menu hasn't disappointed. However, when I came here for brunch, they sat us in the lounge area and the music was blaring which doesn't quite set the mood for enjoying my delicate quiche. I think for brunch, try to get a seat outside or in the bar side. Perhaps music is less loud in those areas.   Overall, great burgers and drinks.  Awesome daily specials that make you want to return each day of the week. Loud music at all times, including brunch service.",

When was the last time you said that about a burger? Me, the spring of 2001 at a tailgate, but that's a review for another time. The sides were creative and fun, the side salad was so huge, it had its own zip code! To top it off they were super sweet to our dogs! I'd show you a picture but I was to consumed with the flavorful meal I was wolfing down!",

Every time I have driven past I would always smell burgers and it always was a delightful smell. It's not a very big restaurant, but they do have a bar and extra outdoor seating. When you walk in you will notice the big chalkboard with the weekly specials displayed. On Saturdays and Sundays they serve brunch and offer a Bloody Mary bar.   I knew from the start I was going to order a burger, and pretty quickly decided on the bbq burger which came with a BBQ sauce and applewood smoked bacon. The BBQ sauce is not on the sweet side it's more tangy, but complemented the burger well! The burger itself is made with a blend of sirloin, brisket and short rib. It was so fresh and well prepared! If you are not in the mood for burgers they do have other menu options as well. For my side I ordered the pasta salad and it was just okay, nothing special. My mom ordered the Kentucky bourbon burger and she really enjoyed with. The bourbon sauce was on the sweeter side compared to the BBQ sauce. She went with the home fries as her side! Overall I think this is a pretty solid burger joint and would definitely like to stop in for brunch one day!",

Cassis had great, interesting food combination, and established it as a fantastic brunch place. Then Benjamin's added great burgers (I even survived their early burger-on-white-bread days) that kept the unique-flavor mojo of Cassis.   Bier's has largely (and wisely) kept much (all?) of Benjamin's burger and sides menu, kept the great bar and engaging staff, and added the interest of self-brewed and (mostly) local beers. Bonus that brewer-owner Jake is a good guy, a local, friendly, and hangs around and cares about the place and his customers' experiences.   A few neighbors swear by the jalapeno cream cheese burger. My go-to is Swiss cheese and mushroom (excellently sauteed) burger and broccoli salad. I've taken a couple vegetarian friends there who have loved the veg-burger renditions.   The home brews I've had have been top notch. I don't have the fancy \"over-tones-of-hazelnut-and-espresso\" lingo because I'm no beer connoisseur, but the stouts have been stout and the ambers, well, amber. (Don't ask me about anything lighter.) All good to excellent.   Nice, local, good place with moments of greatness.",

The bartender was friendly and took my to-go order. The menu has a lot to choose from..  it was tough to choose. I love burgers~!  I went with the \"Buffalo Blue\" Burger (Buffalo Sauce, Blue Cheese, Romaine Lettuce) well I must say \"it was a mighty tasty burger\".  You can tell it was good beef and real blue cheese crumbles.  The burger was juicy and quite delicious.  I was surprised that \"French fries\" weren't on the menu.  They are just such a great accompaniment to a burger (American girl always).     Sides include: Bacon Fat Home Fries, Sundried Tomato Pesto Pasta Salad, Curried Cabbage Cole Slaw, Potato Salad or Broccoli Salad.    Bunch on Sunday 10:30 - a.m. - 9:00 p.m. brunch menu & build your own Bloody Mary bar available until 3pm.  Theres a small dining room area - bar and a jukebox! !   I love that!  There is outside seating (weather permitting).  I bet they have a great happy hour.. I cant wait to go back!   Nice draft beer selection.. always rotating.. that's cool.   My meal was $10.95 - burger plus a side - a little above average.. but was it worth it? YES",

I called in a take out order since I didn't have time for a full sit down meal. The person who answered the phone was friendly and helpful. I ordered the soft pretzels with truffle mustard and the rosemary goat cheese and green apple burger with a side of home fries. When I went in, my order was ready to go which I appreciated.  Like others have said, all the food seems to be cooked at a flat top at the end of the bar which is weird. The pretzels were nothing special but the truffle mustard was delicious and flavorful. The burger was juicy and the goat cheese was melted over it with the apples cut into match sticks. I ordered the burger medium well and it was just that. The burger was great. The home fries were run of the mill and like a lot of other posters I can say their side dish menu is lacking. They should invest in a fryer and offer some french fries or other options. Overall my first experience with Benjamins was positive and I would definitely try it again!",

I went back last night as a lot of people in the neighborhood have been saying it improved. They were right, the food and service is much better these days!  I got their staple item, a burger with bacon fried home fries. Both were very good. The appetizer I got was was shrimp and grits. It was done differently than I have ever seen it, but it was really good.",

Great place to relax, even a good date location.  I want this place to succeed.  Honestly I don't understand the complaints about the prices.  If you want a shitty cheap burger go to McDonalds.",

Burgers were quality beef, cooked up nice and juicy, on very nice buns. They were a bit pricey but not ridiculous, and they were quality. We all left satisfied. Food was served on a metal pie plate lined with waxed paper, and utensils were metal (not plastic.) I only wish that they had regular french fries, and that we had asked to have the fireplace turned on.",

    "text": "One of our regular haunts, The Modern Cafe, was packed, and our party couldn't get a table, so our fearless leader suggested we go across the street to this new place, Benjamins, and give them a shot.  It didn't take us long to figure out why this place didn't have as many customers as their neighbor, because the prices seemed ridiculous, although the atmosphere was ever-so-slightly upscaled compared to The Modern.  We arrived at 4:30, which was supposedly happy hour, but we didn't seem to get happy hour prices on the beers and such that we ordered.  Two people from our party ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich because they didn't have enough money to buy a burger.  Yes, you heard me right.  The burgers were THAT pricy.  The grilled cheese turned out to be very weird - grilled cheese on a pancake?  AND of course, it was ALSO overpriced.  Apparently, our party wasn't the type of clientele that this establishment was interested in, because it took forever to get somebody to take our order, even though the place was mostly empty.  And how long does it take to cook a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches, anyway?  I had a cup of coffee, and nobody ever bothered to ask me if I wanted a refill, so that's all I had.  My friend had a couple of Budweisers with his \"grilled cheese\" thing, plus some home fries that he paid extra for but didn't end up eating because they were greasy, and his tab was over $16.  At one point while waiting for our order, we decided to shoot a game of pool upstairs and left our stuff at the table.  In a few minutes, the same inattentive waitress hunted us down and asked whether or not we were still going to use the table, even though our food hadn't come yet.  She had an attitude about it, even though we were the ONLY people in the place who were using a table.  This surley waitress was training a newbee, and ended up handing a sizeable tip to the apologetic and sincere newbee, and pretty much stiffed the surley one because she treated us like we were poor college kids and not worth her time or effort.  We frequently go out to the restaurants and bars in this neighborhood, and there are some excellent places that we visit often like Nikki's Thai, Peppi's, The Allegheny Sandwich Shop, Georgio's, and of course, The Modern Cafe.  If Benjamins lasts more than a year, I'll be shocked, because neighborhood regulars like us won't be spending any money there.",

The waitress was a complete ditz that kept dropping utensils and ignoring our needs (We were one of two tables that had people sitting there.) She spent most of the night texting on her phone, not paying attention to the fact that we were out of drinks completely. We ordered two servings of appetizer pretzels with mustard. Mustard was great. Pretzels were cheap, store bought hard pretzels. We stared in disbelief for a few minutes before deciding to eat them. We ordered and shared a BBQ, Swiss Cheese, and Bacon burger, (Which was a little too red, but okay.) They do all of the cooking on a flat top stove right in the dining/bar area, which fills the room with a foul grease smell that you will end up smelling like in a matter of minutes. I was pretty disgusted with the atmosphere, and the restaurant appears to be confused as to what it's trying to be. All of my clothes reeked of nasty grease. Thought I was going to a pretty decent burger place, not a Dennys.",

We had to wait a while to pay, but otherwise it was a good trip.  Verdict: Muddy Waters' bloody Mary bar is better, but Bier's eggs Benedict are above Ease's for coming with a token fruit or vegetable (in this case, two slices of tomato).",

My only complaint is that they closed at 10 - didn't get to stay for the rest of the game.",

    "text": "Must have been a bad night. Our server was nice. I had a fantastic burger there when it was Benjamin's about two years ago, but last week it was total butt. I'm talking charred gray butt. I don't send stuff back and cooking is hard but I was still left eating half a gray charred 'medium rare' butt burger. I will say it had this interesting consistency to it, an odd vein of slightly pinkish meat on half of one side. My egg did not run, which seemed a fitting insult.   My wife ordered a grilled cheese that made the table giggle. It was like if someone never made grilled cheese before but read about it in a book and wanted to give it a go. Or maybe the end result of you taking a frozen pre-made panini and banging it around a frying pan for a couple of minutes. It wasn't inedible, because it is cheese. But that's all it had going for it.   Benjamin's was an otherworldly experience so this bums me out considerably. The beers were ok, though. And everyone was nice.",

    "text": "We have been going to Benjamin's for a few years now and this is by far our favorite burger joint in the Burgh!  We found this place by going to a Yelp event years back where we got to try a lot of their food menu items.  After that event we knew we had to come back and try it out for ourselves.  We did and we just keep coming back.       You have to park on the street for Benjamin's but we have never had a hard time finding street parking.  We usually park at the most a block away.  If you come here on Sunday's or after 6pm it's free to park on the street in Pittsburgh. When you walk in the bar is along the right side or you can seat down at a table on the left if you prefer that.  There is a nice area in the back part of the restaurant to lounge and eat at a table as well but we always go straight to the bar to eat!       These burgers are great and that's why we travel from the burbs to come all the way here.  We used to order their shrimp and grits as an appetizer to start but we don't anymore.  My wife got an allergic reaction after eating them and I had to run and I mean literally run to Rite Aid to go get her some Benadryl.  I'm sure it was nothing that they did but she just had a bad reaction so we haven't ordered that since.         My wife loves their Candied Jalapeno Burger.  She always thinks she should try something else but just like our recent visit I told her if it isn't broke don't fix it!  So she ordered it again and loved it.  I usually go with the BBQ burger.  This last time I went with their Kentucky Bourbon instead.  Their burgers are so good I just didn't' want the bbq to take from the flavor.  I made the right choice.  This burger was so juicy and just right.  I'll be ordering it the next time we visit.         The one complaint that I have would be their side dishes.  They have a bar side grill that they do all their cooking on.  That's great and I like that there are no fryers or fried food.  Just I still want some fries with my burger.  I eat healthy usually so maybe even baked fries or sweet potatoes fries would work.  That's the only thing missing for me here at Benjamin's.         The bar area is nice and they have one TV in the front of the bar and two in the back.  Probably not the best spot to watch a game but it's still decent.  The bartenders are usually good and they seem nice.  We have noticed that they do get caught up in conversations or watching jeopardy while  on the job but I still love this place.       If you're tired of all of the chain restaurant burgers and want a truly great burger come to Benjamin's.  You won't be disappointed!",

I had heard that this was the \"best burger in town\" and after testing it out, I think I agree with this sentiment. I have tried both the rosemary gouda burger and the red-wine braised onion burger and both were fantastic. Every burger on the menu sounds appealing, so I will work my way down the list. The service has not been consistent but on my last visit it was great, plus I don't might sacrificing great service for a great burger. Each burger comes with your side of choice - I'm not sure you can go wrong here but the pasta salad is a nice alternative to fries. Also, the brie and honey appetizer is absolutely delicious - if that is your type of thing don't pass it up!",

I'm not certain if the full menu -- in addition to the brunch menu -- was available because it was Pittsburgh Marathon weekend, but that was a nice surprise. And a couple people at my table took advantage, getting breakfast burgers for their late brunch. A couple others ordered omelettes, which looked dense and delicious, more like a frittata. Me? Easy choice -- buttery shrimp and grits. Spectacular.  Most of us took advantage of the bloody Mary bar -- extensive list of goodies to add, several different mixes (and spice levels) to serve as bases and a long list of vodkas -- including a few they'd infused on their own -- make the bloody bar a mandatory stop on a Sunday morning.  Finally, I have to say I was impressed with the service. Benjamin's was jammed not long after the marathon had passed through Western Avenue, but the folks helping us did a good job of keeping our glasses full and making sure our food got out in a reasonable amount of time.   I'll always be willing to go back to Benjamin's for a burger. I'm happy to say I have a great neighborhood option for brunch as well.",

Sometimes service can be iffy tho when there is a crowd but they manage to do a good job. They have no kitchen but they do have a tiny grill at the end of the bar. This will surely slow the process of cooking many meals at once. This is a good place to go when you aren't in a hurry and don't want the same old food. I would recommend Benjamin's for happy hour or a lazy Sunday lunch or dinner. They have some great daily (happy hour) specials so be sure to call and ask!",

    "text": "So, I tried Benjamin's today in Allegheny West.  Not a huge disappointment. The service was very good.  The burgers we ordered were accomplished very well.   I had BBQ Bacon Burger and my friend had some Balsamic vinegar, Apple, whatever burger.  I hesitated ordering it because I imagined cheap nasty bacon with ValuTime BBQ sauce.  It was actually quite good.  The bacon was very thick cut.  The bun was perfect and toasted.  It appeared to possibly be whole wheat as well.  I unfortunately did not get to try my friend's burger.   I had home fries and he tried the cole slaw.  The home fries were good, but very breakfasty.  I would've been happier with fresh cut french fries.  They were light and not soaked in oil but not exactly what I wanted from a burger place.  The cole slaw was _NOT_ cole slaw.  It was cabbage but with a vinegar dressing.  It was very tasty and felt like it was much healthier than something slathered with a cream dressing.  I would order it again but I don't feel it should be called cole slaw.     The menu was actually rather confusing at first.  It seemed to be in the wrong order, if that makes sense.  We also only went hoping to have appetizers or something small and really the only real option was a meal or wine/beer.  The appetizer section seemed to be lacking any sort of appeal.  The other sandwiches that were offered did not appeal to me at all.  My friend thought of the Salmon but decided against. There also did not to appear to be a children's or Smaller portion section of the menu.  Yes, I order from the children's menu.  I like the smaller portions and the smaller price.  My favorite is the \"Chicken Toes\" from James' St Gastropub.   I did have the White Sangria which was amazing. We did not sample any other drinks because it was a quick lunch/early dinner. Overall, I would return but it would not become a frequent spot for me. Other's commented about how the food was served in the past.  I was ok with how it was served and how the staff treated us. However, it was really more of a nothing spectacular, nothing horrible thing.  I saw no specials and nothing extremely fabulous stood out to me.  If guests were visiting, I would show them one of the other awesome places we have to eat first before returning.",

The Siracha deviled eggs are pretty disappointing in my opinion, but the balsamic goat cheese burger is worth the trip alone. Their unique flavors are refreshing, and frankly a little higher brow than most upscale burger joints (read: Burgatory) which is definitely a good thing.   Upon my last visit however, my party waited for upwards of an hour for our meals to arrive. The chef came out of the kitchen to personally explain the situation to our table. He said that the propane ran out as he was cooking our order. He felt extremely terrible about the whole ordeal, and comped the entire meal, plus our hefty bar tab (easily over $150 total).  My experiences at Benjamin's continue to be pleasant surprising, and I'm glad to see that they continue to gain popularity. I just hope they stay underground enough that I won't have to wait for upwards of an hour to get a table, like some other burger joints (read: Burgatory).",

    "text": "This place has the best beer list in the city. They always have the best beers from the local breweries. I actually have yet to try their own brew line called War Street because I've been so happy with the first beer that I end up ordering it again. I definitely will be back and will try their beer eventually! As for their food, I was really impressed with everything. I went specifically for a burger. There's a handful of choices all of which sounded good. I ended up picking the goat cheese and green apple Berger and my boyfriend got the regular goat cheese burger with lettuce tomato and onion. We both picked the pasta salad with roasted red peppers as our side - it was a really good choice,  I would recommend trying it above all other sides.   I really like the staff that work here as well. They are smooth with their convos and delivery and aren't too formal. We mentioned that we were be going to an event which started at 6:30 and the waitress went out of her way to make sure we were out by 6/610 by bumping our food order up so it was brought out to us faster. She was pretty attentive and very funny. We both really liked her.  Lastly, you can go to their back patio area and bring your dog. I didn't think this place could get any better and then I saw dogs.",

    "text": "This was a pleasant surprise for me. We had driven past it on several occasions and from the outside it looked like a typical bar, not that anything is wrong with that. However, this is a step or two above, and more of the brew pub atmosphere like the name implies. They had live music in a Friday night, and $3 sangrias, which were very good. We chose the house beer - this is also the home of War Streets Brewing - and were not disappointed, but the other beers available represented a few other local craft breweries.   The food was good enough. I had the sweet onion bisque (excellent) and a crab cake sandwich. My husband had one of the several burgers offered. My disappointment was in the price and portions. I felt that a crab cake sandwich with a small cup of soup for $17 seemed a little too pricey for the portion size and place. My husband said his burger was fine, but he was unenthusiastic about it. We shared the caramel sea salt cake for dessert. I was not a fan of the chocolate syrup drizzle, but overall, it was good.   This would be a nice casual night out for anyone wanting to explore more of the dining scene on the North Side.",

    "text": "Where do you go when you have two people that have some hefty dietary restrictions?  Bier's Pub, that's where.  They got you covered.  We went a little after lunch so there wasn't a wait for a table for us.  We opted for outdoor seating instead of staying inside.  You know, one of those rare, rain free days in Pittsburgh, had to take advantage of it.  Once seated we placed a drink order and looked over the menu.  We weren't in the mood for burgers, but that doesn't really matter here.  My better half got the House-Smoked Tofu with a side of Broccoli Salad.  He said it was one of the best sandwiches he had except for the fact that it was onion heavy.  He pulled off a majority of them.  I went with the BLT.  Now, when you think of a BLT you think bacon, lettuce, tomato.  Because that's what a BLT is suppose to be.  Let me tell you what this sandwich involves here: Applewood Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Hard Fried Egg, and American Cheese.  So I guess that would be a BLTOEC, I don't even think you can make a word out of that.  Whatever.  When this thing showed up at the table I had an up close meeting with a piece of the bacon.  It fell right on my lap before the server sat the plate on the table.  Don't worry, I didn't waste it, I put that bad boy piece of bacon back on the sandwich.  Walked away with a huge grease stain on my shorts after that, but it was worth it.  I do have to admit that even though this wasn't your conventional BLT, it was jam packed with tons of flavor.  I enjoyed every bite of it.  What I was disappointed about was the side I chose.  I opted for the potato salad.  This thing was watery and really had no taste to it.  It was very bland, but not totally a reason to discard it.    Great place for a quick lunch and for people that are looking to eat a bit healthier.  You don't find that much at a bar in the city.",

    "text": "We had horrible service before a Steelers' game. We (4 adults) arrived around 10:45AM (they open at 10:30AM) and it was already fairly busy. Our only option was to eat outside which was OK with us. Typically, service is much slower when you eat outside and we were all aware of that. Keeping that in mind, we ordered our drinks and meals as soon as our server came to our table the first time. We were served drinks and when she walked by again we ordered another round and asked for her to close us out. She ran our cards and we tipped her.   After 1 hour we were still not served our meals. This place is really small and the kitchen is even smaller. We have been here many times and know that it can take some time. But, this was ridiculous. We went inside to ask the server and she said the ticket was lost but we would be next. She brought out 2 drinks for 4 people to share which really confused us.   Another 30 minutes passed and we had still not received our meals. We went inside again and we were told there were still 3 orders ahead of ours. We were again confused because our table was supposed to be the next table served 30 minutes ago. We told the server we no longer had time to wait and to just cancel our orders. She was extremely rude and would not show us the receipt for the meal. We needed her to credit us for the meals we did not eat and to adjust our tip.   She still would not show us the receipt and we were forced to take a picture of the ordering screen to make sure she actually credited us. The server never apologized once and told us we were the ones being rude. All 4 of us will never go back. Other people were inside complaining about similar service so I'm sure they lost a lot of customers that day.   If you're looking for a place to eat before a Steelers' game, go next-door to Modern instead!",

However, recent experiences have not been good and I will no longer visit or recommend to anyone.  Service is horrible and the food is not what it used to be...   Maybe its new ownership, but this is a place I used to call a hidden gem in the North Side. Now, Id say just go to Nicky's, Modern Cafe, Max's, or Lola...    They still have a good beer selection and cool Pittsburgh art but that's the only reason I didn't give 1 star...  Other reviewers seem to have experienced the same issues so hopefully ownership makes improvements and gets this place back to what it used to be.",

The menu had some interesting burgers on it. When they came out, you could see, the patties were made in house, which I really liked.  They had a mix of more classic burgers, like a mushroom and Swiss, and a black and blue, but then they had interesting stuff like candied jalapeno or Kentucky bourbon or fancy pants. We of course ordered the crazy ones and they were just as good as the server said they would be. We would recommend this place!",

    "text": "If half stars were an option I would probably give Bier's Pub three and a half stars. I debated on how to review this since we went to eat, but also to check out War Streets. I decided to do the beer reviews on War Streets instead.  We went in late afternoon on a Wednesday. There was nobody in the place. We were using this to kick off a brewery tour and get something to eat. We sat at the bar.  First the space. I really liked the space, both the restaurant side and the taproom area. It has a clean yet industrial feel. The artwork here is awesome, especially the Mr. Rogers. They have the two list on a chalkboard.  I ordered the goat cheese and apple burger but with a veggie burger instead. They have so many fun topping options here. I'm not usually one to order veggie burgers out unless it's my only option but this is house made and sounded good. It was delicious. Hands down the best veggie burger I have ever had. It was moist and super flavorful.   The sides are a different story. They are a burger place that doesn't offer fries. This may be due to a small kitchen area. They do offer home fries, but they are cooked in bacon fat so not a good option for a vegetarian. My boyfriend ate them and said they were ok but he couldn't even detect any bacon flavor. I will try another side option next time.  My real issue was the service. We hit at an odd time and it seemed to be shift change. Shortly after we sat at the bar maybe two other tables of two sat down. There was barely anyone in the restaurant. Our original waitress started doing other things to get ready to leave. Service was slow and shouldn't have been. There were several employees standing behind and around the bar chitchatting about their personal lives and eating. Generally I don't see employees eating personal food from home in plain view of customers.   I understand we hit at a weird time and this wouldn't have bothered me so much except for the fact that we sat with empty water glasses because the employees were too distracted. We were two feet away, we shouldn't have to try to get their attention and ask for water more than once.   I will give them another chance in hopes this was a fluke. Only reason though is because the veggie burger was that good. Although I will try to hit when they have a special going on.",

We did not order food however everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled delicious! The ladies restroom was awesome! Clean, spacious and cool art on the walls. Sometimes the restrooms in bars are kind of sketchy not this one. I came out and told my husband omg they have the coolest bathroom! If we are in town again we would probably stop in again.

Walk in to a beautiful and stylish bar.   Ordered the crab cakes (lump meat mind you), wings with sauce on side and a side of Caesar that prompted me to ask whether it was the side or main because it was a decent size.   Everything was solid and good.  Caesar salad dressing is made with anchovies, but you barely taste it, just the enjoyable tang of a Caesar done right.  The mushroom and cheese burger was definitely done right.  I was tempted to order another one to go, you know for the moment when you wake up around midnight and are craving a good burger...but H wisely advised me not to be a glutton.  So instead I snuck in an order or crepe brulee that was as creme brulee should be.  Great choice.  Will likely be back.",

The place has a great selection of craft beers.  The bartender gave some good suggestions and I ended up with a nice flight (the first night).  All the flavors I had were wonderful.  The cheese and meat plate we ordered was just OK but I felt bad as we left a lot of the toppings on the plate.  They needed to add more bread/crackers and make it bread that isn't so hard.  The second night we went back we sat at the bar and split a pulled pork.  The sandwich was much better this night.  The best was learning about a new brew available, Redrum, and meeting the brewer himself.  In fact, I enjoyed it I bought a 6 pack and now have it at home.  The beer, the staff, and the people could easily make this a local hangout for me if I lived in the area. I feel they are just shy of 5 stars due to the food.  I would be there nightly having another flavor or two.    They have live music too.  I wish they didn't pipe it in so loud in to the main area so conversations didn't have to be yelling matches.  If you want the music louder just go upstairs. Leave it as background for the main bar area.  If  I lived there I would easily say \"I'll be back soon\"!",

    "text": "I'm so glad that when Bier's took over Benjamin's they kept the same menu, because I thought the former had fantastic burgers. Probably one of the best in the Burgh.   Thankfully, this still holds True. The burger is phenomenal. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Honestly, a good burger starts with good meat, and I do believe they purchase quality meat. I asked for my burger medium, and it came out more medium rare. No biggie though, because it was still delicious. Just go up one notch depending on how you like your burger. I usually ask for medium because it can vary from place to place.   The BBQ burger I ordered had a tangy sauce and cheese. Plus, I was so happy to have a complete burger, since they offer gluten free buns. Thanks guys! Great to have a normal burger somewhere, even while being gluten free. I also got the side of whiskey baked beans, which were very tasty as well.  The sad part to this story is I can't try their beers, but my hubby really liked his. Again, thanks Biers for making the smart decision to not only offer GF buns, but carrying local gluten free Auroch's beer. I was so happy to have a beer with my burger! Can't wait to do it again soon.",

I moved on to the hangover burger. It was delicious and the home fries were good as well. My wife had breakfast and enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan of their house made beer, so I enjoyed some Grist House that was on tap. Small place but decent.",

    "text": "I went here with a couple friends before the football game.  We wanted something quick but substantial.  I am a big fan of the \"vibe\" of this restaurant, cozy, dimly lit, fire place, beautiful bar.    The menu at this place isn't huge and all sandwiches/burgers (but hey! its a burger joint so I guess that makes sense).  There are a lot of fun options, rosemary balsamic goat cheese and green apples, aged cheddar, wine soaked onions.  So I might not be the prime candidate for this spot because I don't eat red meat or pork.   Generally, burger spots have some alternatives (turkey burgers, chicken breast, salmon, portabellas) but this place only had a veggie burger.  I wasn't floored by the patty.  I am normally a fan of zesty bean based burgers but this was had a sweat potato base.  It wasn't horrible but I have had better.  The consistently wasn't stellar.   I ended up getting the rosemary-balsamic-goat cheese with green apples.  It was good but the toppings were the best part and the bread was a bit much.   We also got the mustard truffle pretzels which isn't really anything fancy on the pretzel front (just normal Giant Eagle mini pretzels).  The truffle mustard was awesome though! I think the order is $1.95 so its not breaking the bank and makes the Giant Eagle pretzels understandable.   PROS: Cozy ambiance, good bottle list, fire place, pool tables, fun toppings.   CONS: No draft beer, limited veggie options   OVERALL: I will be back. Apparently, the menu changes frequently so I look forward to some updates.",

    "text": "Benjamin's is a new bar taking over BRiX's old space (and I believe by the same owners) after zoning issues caused them to close their doors. Their menu is focused, offering about a half-dozen varieties of burger, some available as house-made veggie burgers, and gluten-free buns upon request. Three sides and a few appetizers ranging from pretzels to pate are also on the menu.  The space is narrow, with a large bar sitting on the right half and a handful of tables on the left. At the far end of the bar is where the cooking appears to take place, and beyond that in a separate room is a billiards room(And maybe more, I didn't venture inside). Arriving on a Saturday evening, there were a few sporadic diners, but plenty of space even for a large walk-in party.   In addition to their full bar, Benjamin's has a beer and wine menu - no drafts though, currently at least. Their can/bottle menu has a few craft and local favorites in addition to common macro selections. The prices are reasonable, and their daily happy hours can make this bar a steal(4:30-6:30 - ranging from $1 PBR to $4 wine).  We started off with the mini pretzels and truffle mustard($2). The truffle mustard was as it sounds: Mustard with a splash of earthy truffle flavor that really comes through. I'm not sure it's my favorite truffle-flavored condiment, but it was tasty. The pretzels themselves appeared to be regular store-bought mini pretzels.  I chose a burger with green chilis, salsa, and chipotle sour cream and a side of home fries($9), while my friend decided on an egg, bacon, and hot sauce mayo burger with slaw($11), both medium.  The food came quickly and immediately the first thing I noticed is that my burger was entirely raw. The server was happy to correct the error and did so quickly. In the meantime I had some of my homefries, which were good, but just homefries. I would really prefer french fries, but I'm not sure they have a fryer here.  My burger came back warm and cooked to a nice medium. Eating these burgers is a messy task - they are juicy to the point of excess and leave your area soaked. Unfortunately, I found the flavor of the burgers to be lacking, and my toppings didn't really didn't add much. My friend agreed that his tasted a bit bland.  Because Benjamin's is new, I would like to go back and give them another shot, but there are a lot of places to get an excellent burger in Pittsburgh, so they're entering a market with some pretty tough competition - especially if their menu remains as focused as it is. I do like their attempt at combining a classy atmosphere with spruced-up blue-collar food, but at some points it felt more like an identity crisis than a synergy. They appear to be working at it constantly, though, so I'm hopeful that in time, Benjamins will shine",

Sure, you walk inside and Benjamins is beautiful looking. From the exposed brick right down to the wish-I-had wooden tables. But with this look also comes an aroma of greasy burgers that you are sure to walk out smelling like. They are doing what they can to ventilate, I guess, as they had a large metal device trying to take out some of the smell. It just wasn't enough.  The bar tender, who also served us, was very friendly. He suggested things from the menu that were unusual and a must try. Unfortunately I wanted to try what he suggested as a veggie burger. More like bun burger with a paper thin patty of veggie burger. I do not recommend the veggie burgers from this place for a second. I just tried my hand at a veggie burger the week before at home, and mine was 8x's better on the first try. Yikes.  Beer selection was plentiful. I love when places have a lot to choose from. I'd like to go back to the billiards area on a game day with some friends and hang out there.   All in all it was, well, A-OK. My dates burger was delicious so I'd say, stick with the burgers. It is, after all, what they are known for.",

We went for brunch and started on the back patio however the weather did not hold out and we found ourselves inside shortly after.  Our waiter seemed a little off that day and confused about menu items although I think he was just helping out.  They had a blood Mary bar which I would recommend if you like these drinks.  For my entree I went with the BLT-bacon, lettuce, tomato, and fried egg. It was supposed to be served with fruit but came with potatoes. The sandwich was delicious. I would have preferred fruit but the potatoes were very tasty. What amazes me about this place is they have one tiny stove that they cook most meals on one at a time.  The only disappointment was someone in our party ordered the crab eggs benedict. They forgot her ordered and she was served after we all finished eating and did not like the crab. The restaurant more than made up for this by brining her out a side of potatoes right away and serving us 2 bread pudding desserts-these were delicious and served warm with ice cream.  The owner also came out and apologized and asked for suggestions for improvement.  Overall I would skip brunch and go back for a burger and $3 Sangrias they have on Fridays.",

The front window was open, so we enjoyed a nice open air dining experience while dining inside.  We enjoyed the charcuterie very much as an appetizer and each one of our four dishes were delicious.  While our server was nice, I was very disappointed in the length of time it took for our food to arrive.  From sitting down, it took approx. 45 minutes for our entrees, and there was only one other table in the place!  For it being that empty, I would have expected much quicker service.    Also, for the classy casual vibe that the restaurant is trying to cultivate, it was very disruptive to have two children running around shrieking and climbing on things.  I don't know if they were an employee's or the owner's, but it was a very annoying addition to our meal.  I'm a big proponent of trying to let an establishment know of a problem in case they can fix it before I take it to the internet to complain, but how do you ask them to please take their children elsewhere?",

    "text": "I really want to like this place.  It's nice but just a touch overpriced for me, especially on the North Side.  I was here for lunch on a Saturday but ended up with the brunch BLT and side of homefries.  The sandwich was a little lopsided; all the B was on one side and kept falling off.  I wish I had more L, and the T was one slice in the middle, so I wanted more of that, too.  I really didn't enjoy the chunks of onion.  I'm not talking about a thick-cut ring, or slivers of onion spread on top - there were big chunks of yellow onion just tossed on the bottom of the bun.  I did enjoy the fried egg on top, though.  I love fried eggs on anything!  It added just the right amount of moisture to the bread (a hamburger bun, naturally).  It was busy, so we sat at the bar.  I love sitting at the bar.  I just wish I had the quick service that everyone around me was afforded.  I couldn't decide on a beer when I was first asked what I wanted and I waited until my meal arrived to get a beer - and I had to ask for it.  I wasn't sitting at the far end, I was smack in the middle of the bar and two girls kept walking back and forth but never stopped to inquire if I was ready for a beer yet.  I hate to harp on it, but if I'm paying $9 for a draft, I want $9 service.  I'll be back to try more, but I'll try to come at a slower time and speak up sooner for that beer!",

    "text": "I'd like to see this business get a boost in their star ratings and here's why.   The decor is so lovely on the inside , lit candles on the bar and modern art works on the walls. The back section of Benjamin's  has additional seating a pool table and   oversized black comfy couches.  I can see myself having fun back there ;) I dined here two days in row and enjoyed both visits.   And also Benjamin's has a back patio seating area, for those of you who value this sort of thing.  I ordered the cheese board yumm-o which is served with truffle mustard and wine braised onions. The blue cheese was soft and melt in your mouth delicious.  I did think it was odd that there was no cheese knife so I had to eat the cheese with my hands. I used the cheese to scoop up the mustard, no biggie.   I also ordered a burger topped with truffle mustard and wine soaked onions with a side of cole slaw.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw , way too much vinegar.  The burger was juicy and hot and peppery and made to order. If they cook all the burgers this well I'll be back to sample more, particularly the blue cheese, green olives topped burger.   Warning, they serve all their food on paper plates with plastic utensils , that justs a heads up!",

Came on a not terribly busy Sunday night, and somehow ended up with one waiter taking care of us primarily, and a second waiter coming over after we had ordered appetizers to ask us about ordering food, and when I replied that we had ordered but then clarified that we hadn't ordered dinner yet, he became exasperated. The appetizers came out at the same time as our burgers (which we did receive apologies for), which were all cooked to a medium rare (at most) despite 2 of 3 of us ordering them more well-done. The shrimp with the shrimp and grits appetizer was unseasoned and over-cooked. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon.",

We asked about a specific wine and was only told it had been replaced by a different region, but we decided to try it anyway.  What we weren't told was about the size of the pour...yes, it is on the menu, but I expected to be asked if we wanted the 4 oz or 8 oz, or even the entire bottle.  Instead, I was just poured the 8 oz.  After 3 glasses, I basically bought the entire bottle for $40!!  Way too much on this type of wine.  I'm not a wine snob, but I know when a wine is worth that amount of money and this wine was good, but definitely not $40 worth!  Kinda felt like we were duped.  If the waitress had been SPECIFIC about the pour, I would not have ordered three glasses of wine...the fact that it gave me a good buzz is probably what helped them sell me a $40 bottle of wine.  Seriously??!!  Way overpriced.   Good thing the food was good...that's what got this place the 3 stars.",

My one complaint: their potato salad is so promising, what with bleu cheese and a mustard vinaigrette, but the one time I got it, the potatoes themselves were undercooked. Like crunchy raw.

The bread was tasty and lightly toasted, and the bacon slices were perfectly thick and perfectly slight, the provolone was also melted just right. I typically define a quality burger by an ability to eat it \"as is\", not adding anything that is not on the menu description. This burger did not even require extra sauces or ketchup. Service is friendly and fast, and if it matters to you like it matters to me, your water will never be left empty. The only reason they are not getting five stars is because the sides (one comes free which every burger) is nice, lack much to be desired. I physically could not eat the broccoli salad the taste was so displeasing, and a friend who got home fries, left dissatisfied as well. They don't serve basics like French fries and potato chips, and I think that is probably a \"miss\" but just be safe and trust the name, burgers are certainly their forte!",

They seem to have addressed each of my initial issues and I'm now a fan!! They have draft beer!!! OK, not a lot of taps but still, enough to suffice! And they had $3 beer specials on my visit there on Saturday - including 21st Amendment! I love that!! So count me in as a happy camper!  We sat at the bar, which is really charming. The whole place just feels good, even without the fire. I'm sure that's coming as the weather turns. Kasey was our bartender and was just totally awesome and attentive. She was great and a delight to talk to. We ordered burgers and they were spectacular! The beef really does make a difference and these were incredibly flavorful - the custom hand mixed blend rivals most any others I've ever had - and is far better than that of Burgatory in my opinion. I had the burger with the fried egg on top (love that!), thick cut smoked bacon and  hot sauce mayo and I'm here to tell you it was fabulous! It was bigger than the burgers we had here previously so I think they've adjusted things properly. My wife's goat cheese and green apple burger was equally amazing and we both left stuffed!!   Although I didn't order them, the pretzels which initially were vending machine quality bag pretzels are now on the menu as \"soft\" pretzels with truffle mustard so I'm assuming they've improved there as well!  A great place and I can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "I stopped by here last Friday evening with my fiance for dinner.  We had tried going to Benjamins this past summer whenever we were in the North Side only to be turned away because their oven wasn't working.  We figured it to be a fluke and headed over at around 7:00 PM on a frigid night.  Whenever we arrived the place was packed with only a single empty table which we were shown to promptly.  This table ended up being near the front of the restaurant and next to two windows and so both my fiance and I elected to keep our jackets on during the whole meal.  I would imagine this is usually not a problem but happened to be that night since Pittsburgh was in a cold snap.  For our dinner my fiance and I decided to start off the meal by splitting the soft pretzels and choosing the truffle mustard over the candied jalapeno cream cheese dipping sauce.  This would later allow me to order the candied jalapeno cream cheese and bacon burger for my entree with a side of curried cabbage cole slaw since I wanted to try different things.  Within a short time of ordering the pretzels came out with a welcome warmth to them.  They tasted pretty good on their own with my only complaint being that they might have been over salted a bit.  That was easily remedied by rubbing some of the salt off before I ate it though.  The real star of this dish ended up being the truffle mustard.  Who would have thought combing truffle with mustard was a good idea?  Well it was as the strong truffle flavor came through first before making room for the nice mustard flavor.  Our entrees came out a bit later and as my burger was being placed down in front of me my first thought was \"This is it for my $10.50 burger?\"  Of course I could have went with the double but the $4.50 more for an extra meat patty that wasn't very large probably wouldn't have made me too happy either.  In any case I decided to start off my dinner by digging into the curried cabbage cole slaw.  There wasn't much curried flavor to the cole slaw but it did have a lot of vinegar on it which I enjoyed but I imagine that many others would not.  Then I moved on to the burger which ended up tasting pretty good .  It's  meat was cooked to the proper medium temperature and the candied jalapeno cream cheese provided some good flavor with a bit of spiciness.  The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't stop here again in the future.  It's not that the food was bad as I ended up enjoying most of what I had ordered but I think that it is overpriced for what you receive.",

    "text": "Went into Benjamin's a few weeks ago and had a decent dining experience. It's a smaller restaurant and it makes for an intimate setting to have a meal. I ordered BBQ wings for an appetizer and they were some of the best I've ever had. The meat was literally falling off the bone. I just wish the serving size was slightly larger.  As for the burger, it too was one of the best I've ever had. Ordered the Kentucky bourbon burger and everything about it was perfect. The patty itself tasted incredibly fresh, the bun was buttered and very light and the toppings on the burger were all very good.   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the service. Our server, a younger woman, took our order and didn't check back in with us after the appetizer was brought out. I wanted to order a beer with my burger but another employee brought us our meal. We didn't see our original server until she brought us our bill, which was 25 minutes after we got our food. A little frustrating but things happen, will consider coming back again sometime.",

We will be duplicating this burger at home.    The BBQ burger is good,  tip... add the cole slaw for some zest.   Definitely hit this spot of you're I  the north side of Pittsburgh.

    "text": "Burgers. They are my soulmate. My one True love. If I could eat a burger every day, I would. So when I find a burger I've yet to try I can't help but succumb to its meaty ways.  The menu features burgers (duh) and a few sandwiches, salads, and starters. Naturally when I go to a place that refers to itself as a \"burger bar\" I get a salad. Just kidding. I got the Top Shelf Cheese burger which is a single burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and your choice of blue, brie, or cheddar cheese. I went with blue cheese because it is the ultimate. The burger was delightful. Seriously. It was a blend of sirloin, brisket, and short rib. I'm a firm believer that you don't need to do a blend if you have quality ground chuck but this blend was flavorful, moist, and overall cooked to my specific temperature requirements aka medium.  The sides that accompany the burgers and sandwiches could use a little work. My broccoli was ok as was the pasta salad and home fries. If Benjamin's steps up it's side game it will have a really great burger combo on its hands.  And for all you gluten free people, Benjamin's offers gluten free buns!",

    "text": "Upon moving to Pittsburgh in 2015, I immediately began my quest to find the best burger in town. I would continuously order my go-to favorite at several burger joints: a medium well cheese burger. Everything was just mediocre. When I found Benjamin's, my mind was blown. Now only is it a quaint little corner restaurant that has an intimate feel, but their food is amazing. I've been here probably a dozen times and it never disappoints. The burgers are always perfect. My favorite sides include the home fries and sundried tomato pasta. I also love the Siracha deviled eggs. Try this place out if you're on the North Side... or make a special trip. It's definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I will not ever be back to your establishment & I will deter others from going as well, due to multiple issues.  Our initial server (younger female with dark red curly hair, tattoos) was inconsistent, forgot to refill our water several times & seemed bothered when I reminded her to do so.  We got sat at our table at about 540-545, and it took at least 30 minutes to get a drink from the bar.  We had multiple servers come by, look at our table, & not acknowledge that we had empty drinks.  We ordered our food at maybe 6-610, and did not receive any of it until 730.  There was a couple at a 2-top across from us that had the same issues.  We got no apology or explanation until we actually asked what the problem was. We got excuses that \"Taylor Swift murdered us today,\" and \"we are doing the best we can\" and \"the kitchen is really backed up.\"  During this litany of excuses, none of the servers offered to discount our food, comp it, provide a free drink or dessert, or anything for the awful service & wait time.   In my time as a server, I would've ensured that I made an effort to discount/comp items or provide a free drink/dessert/appetizer.  Any decent server would know, doing so would have increased my chances for at least a semi-decent tip.   The food runner also brought our food & when I did not say anything (I'm not going to thank someone after I've waited 1.5 hours), he said very rudely and sarcastically, \"you're welcome.\"  I have not abhorrent of a restaurant experience in a very long time.  My friend asked to speak to the manager & we again had to wait so long that we just left.  Not to mention, they forgot her burger's side.   I plan to put this same review on Yelp.  If you want to stay in business, I'd suggest you look deeply into the subpar operations of your establishment.",

The waiter was very friendly, and even made me a martini based off of what my taste buds wanted at the time. Very strong too by the way :-) For appetizers, we enjoyed the cheese board, smoked salmon and Cured meats. All three were amazing! So many amazing flavors. The Cured meats came with a few slices of homemade pickle slices, and spicy brown mustard. The smoked salmon came with capers and horseradish sauce. The cheese board included salted almonds and pure honey. I didn't have a burger but they have many selections and options. My father in law had one and he described it as amazing! I will definitely return.",

We waited for water and finally got the water ten minutes after. We asked them to clean the table because the table was not cleaned as well. The burgers arrived very long after other people arriving (and ordering) after us placed their orders. There was a mistake in the order (issue with the type of cheese and side) - we kept the burger (we did not want to wait again). The server did not charge us for this burger.  During all our meal, the server came very rarely to refill our water or drinks. So, the service was really not great.  For the food, the burgers were really good. The choice of side (broccoli salad, home fries, potato salad) change from the usual french fries.  Obviously, the servers were busy and the place seems packed on a Sunday. But in that case, why there is no more server?  So, very good for the food but horrible for the service. Might be a place to go when it is not packed/crowded.",

In fact, the oven was apparently broken when we arrived, and despite the fact that it took them almost an hour to fix it, the free appetizers we were promised did not appear for at least half an hour, either. Our waitress was nice, but I'm pretty sure she brought me the wrong beer.  This aside, my salmon sandwich with brie was exactly that - a few slices of very smokey salmon and three chunks of brie. I'm not a chef by any means, but how much talent does that really take?? In addition, my side of tomato-basil pesto pasta salad, which I'm sure you're thinking sounds yummy, was really bland.  The best part of the experience was the outdoor seating on the deck, but I was glad I wasn't at one of the tables crammed down in the alley. This out-of-towner was not impressed.",

The gentleman (who I believe was a bartender/bar back), that seated us brought us water & said our waitress would be over shortly. Well, about 20 minutes later, our server, REBECCA, hadn't greeted us until I flagged her down. She took our order & that was the last we'd see of her until she brought our bill, which we had to again, flag her down for. Another waitress brought our food & our waitress, didn't come to check on us once. The same gentleman that seated us cleared our plates.
