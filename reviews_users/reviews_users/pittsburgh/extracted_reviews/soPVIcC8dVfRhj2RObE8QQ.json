The banana/ squash pancakes were not my fav but others I was with liked them and again $5 for 2 small pancakes is pricey .. It was disappointing that brunch was the only option until 2PM on a Saturday and that only one of the three food stations were open as I was hoping to try more things.  The wine library looked really nice -- There's some serious potential for this place to be great and I'm excited to see where it goes...",

There were handfuls of would-be customers wandering around trying to figure out what to do, we saw several give up and leave. Once we figured out that there were more food vendors located upstairs we ordered a few things. No one from Nibbles was at their counter so we couldn't ask any questions, but the Bistro folks were taking orders for Nibbles so obviously someone from Nibbles was physically there, somewhere. We ordered a flatbread with cashew cheese and received a plate of warm pita bread with a tiny amount of very bland cashew cheese. It gave us a good laugh but it was terrible. The Croque Madame from Bistro was fantastic--that's where the two stars come from. The sandwich from the Charcuterie place was just ok, mostly bread. Bathrooms were dirty and the paper towel holders were broken in the men's and women's rooms.",

Now for the food which is why I give 3 stars.  Calamari texture was similar to rubber bands.  shrimp appetizer tasted good but 4 shrimp for 13.00? it's a casual market not a high end seafood restaurant!  the bruschetta appetizer was nothing special. For these reasons our group of 5 decided not to stay for dinner.   The outdoor beer garden looked very nice! I would go back in warmer weather just to have drinks and MAYBE give the food another shot.",

The wait time at the bar (regardless of whether first or second floor) is unbelievably slow.  If you open a tab, you're still stuck waiting in line to get an additional drink and then to close out your tab.  If you don't have a schedule and are up for hanging out and waiting (and waiting!) then it's a fun venue.  The outdoor lighting leaves a lot to be desired--it's hard to see after dark because the lights are strung up over the roofing.  The evening we were there none of the gas heaters were on...and a few should have been, it was a bit chilly in the courtyard.  Stand near Dante's pizza stand and you'll feel warm enough to cope.  Unfortunately, pizza was the only food available this pas weekend.  Once Edgar's taco stand opens, I'll reconsider whether I want to brave the crowds and the slow wait for a pricey beverage.  While nicely renovated, my overall take away was kind of meh.",

The shrimp was not grilled and literally swimming in a pool of olive oil and there were no peas to be found. The hummus seemed to have been blended with what I think may have been white caneli beans and so pasty it was inedible. The bit of veggies it came with was celery which were brown on both ends. The atmosphere is terrific and that is why I gave two stars.",

The atmosphere is awesome; though the second floor was \"empty\" on a Saturday night.  The few patrons that were there, were at the bar, and we still had to wait to be acknowledged and served!  (Bartender was actually rude, and the drinks were mediocre) There was not a taco spot as advertised, a coffee  shop was closed; leaving three food options.  It is cafeteria style, so you need to order your food at the counter and then find a seat.  We tried a $25 \"large\" cheese board; cannot tell you how disappointing!!  The board itself IS large; though sparsely filled with a scattering of nibble size pieces of cheese, a handful of nuts, raisins, orange peels and a \"fancy\" glaze for presentation...  NOT worth the price!! We decided to leave and enjoy a dinner at another establishment! Sorry; but probably won't consider returning any time soon!!",

I Ordered a $30 charcuterie board, you would think for $30 you would have a giant wood plank with large varieties of meats and cheeses.... instead you get a handful of meat, some unwashed grapes, and generic cheeses such as cheddar and Parmesan... we also received no information on what was on the board and waited about 30-40 minutes for it.  My in-laws ordered Chicken and some soup from the bistro (Which took about 45 minutes). Both were very very good, but not worth the price at all! $16 for a large piece of a chicken breast...... nothing else..... who in their right mind would come back and order a $16 piece of chicken that comes with no sides......  I browsed the Pizza menu..... and Noped out of there when I saw they were selling small slices of pizza for $6 each.....  This place is still trying to find their Niche and get their foot in the door... They need to find their identity, but they are going to scare many many people away with a unfriendly uninformative slow staff that is selling extremely over priced food.  They need to focus on the space.... which a perfect place to grab a glass of wine, hang with some friends, read a book, get some coffee or do some work. focus on small bites/appetizers and SELL THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE!!! maybe get a actual wait staff to bring food and drinks to your table.... play some live music and have some events up there to bring people in...

A \"jazz\" band started playing to the empty room, and I could understand why there was nobody there to see that either (and it wasn't even jazz). Whoever manages this place needs to rethink the entire concept. It's a cool old building, but it comes across as a cheesy (and expensive) food court at an abandoned mall.

This galley-esque style of dining offered many different types of foods from enchiladas to breakfast tacos to mussles. I was overwhelmed at first because I had no idea what this place was and was very pleasantly surprised when I got to the second floor of the building where there were 4 different restaurants as well as a wine library. Tony, the owner of the establishment, was incredibly personable and immediately came up to my friend and I to talk us through the different areas of the building. He introduced us to other staff and even offered to cook us one of the daily specials (which is a family recipe of his). Downstairs also houses a brewery and the courtyard outside looks as though it would be worthy of a great atmosphere for a night out with friends. The food overall was both delicious and affordable for such a beautifully layed out space. I highly recommend the Pennsylvania Market as not just a Sunday brunch meal but for anyone who is looking for a laid-back open atmosphere that has many different foods and drinks to offer for you and all of your friends. Definitely a place to share food with pals. I will definitely be back for multiple different reasons (maybe to have brunch, maybe to have a Friday night in the courtyard, maybe to study or do work online on a weekday?).",

I've been a fan of Roman style pizza for a few years and they have effectively nailed it.    The crust was crispy on the outside and had a nice chew once you reached the middle.  The toppings (I had an amazing breakfast pizza with a cracked egg) were smoked and charred to perfection!    At the market, we had a few traditional slices that were crisp and radiating with flavor as well.  The sauce is bright with a slightly acidic base.    Even my daughter liked it and let's face it, most kids are stuck on the run of the mill Squirrel Hill pizza joints.  I could see how someone wouldn't be a fan of this pizza if they were used to cookie cutter pizza factories, but in terms of art- these guys are the Picasso's of Roman pizza.",

    "text": "Prioritize your time in the Strip District on something else, but I'll be keeping my eye (and mixed feelings) on this.  The Pennsylvania Market is a nicely renovated space, but not particularly authentic. The shops are fine, but the mix is closer to the stands at Ross Park Mall than the summer farmers' market in Market Square.   If you are looking for market items, step out to the street on a weekend. If you are looking for a food hall, Smallman Galley is around the corner. If you are looking to kill some time, I guess the wine library upstairs could be acceptable. The pizza at Romulus is admittedly delicious. We got the funghi and ricotta - perfectly soft and crispy, balanced with saltiness from the cheese and earthiness of the mushrooms, with a nice hint of garlic.  The woman leading tastings at Courtyard Winery did a good job (we bought a nice red blend). The space upstairs was nice, and the employees, although inattentive, were nice. I'm not sure that nice makes parking in the strip worth it, though.  Looking forward for the outside courtyard to open when the temperatures warm up to give this another shot.   2.5-stars: Go if you're in the neighborhood and a little desperate ------ Ratings: 5: Go today 4: Go tomorrow 3: Go if you're in the neighborhood 2: Go if you're desperate 1: Go somewhere else",

I got the hummus which I enjoyed but my friends sandwich from nibbles was boring & could have easily been a simple sandwich made at home. Second time we stopped by during the day and no bartender was outside in the court yard so we walked away. My third time last night was the worst by far. Happy hour around 5pm & it was so hot! I mean HOT upstairs where the only open bar was available so we suffered through it. Every person in our group complained about the heat but nothing happened. We did an indoor happy hour bc we thought it would be cooler but no this was just a terrible terrible terrible experience. Giving 3 stars bc the bartender was friendly/nice & the beers were cheap for happy hour. I'll only go back in the winter or if they get some air conditioning upstairs. Such a cool concept, but a big let down.",

    "text": "Cool space. Mediocre food. Not a Pittsburgh native, so I must ask... is there something about Mondays and Tuesdays where people just don't go out? The place (and the rest of the strip district, really) felt empty. After aimless walking the seemingly abandoned streets, my friends and I decided to try PA Market after being enticed by the outdoor balcony. The space has many seating options, and really seems like a great spot to bring some friends and catch up over a drink.  As a whole, I would say that the place would be a potentially good spot for drinks, but would probably skip for food. I was pleasantly surprised that we walked in during happy hour, where drinks (at least the beer) was 50% off menu price. I got a raspberry wheat draft, which was very refreshing and not too sweet or sour. Perfect for a warm summer day.   The food, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. I went to the charcuterie place and got a brie and pear panini. Unfortunately, they didn't have baguettes that day (which is what the the menu described as part of the sandwich). However, instead of informing me, they just replaced it with focaccia bread. The sandwich itself was OK. Bread replacement aside (which I wasn't too bothered by), I wasn't really impressed with the sandwich. For a panini, I was expecting a hot, gooey sandwich. This sandwich really missed that expectation. I wouldn't get it again.   Overall, I would give the food 2-stars, but think that the place has good potential as a place for drinks (thus adding one more star). The day just felt weird. There wasn't anyone at the cashier to get my order. Someone from a neighboring station had to come over. There was a decent number of drafts to pick from the menu, but the first 2 things we tried to order weren't even available. Perhaps the place was still working out some kinks, so I'm sure that some of what I experienced was a result of that. Probably wouldn't come again on my next trip to Pittsburgh. However, I don't want this review to discourage people from trying it during happy hour, cause the price seems pretty reasonable!",

The outdoor courtyard is gorgeous and I can't wait to check it out in the Spring. But for now, I am really enjoying the upstairs. Plenty of seating, 4 food spots to choose from, delicious cocktails and wine from all over the world- can't go wrong. I haven't tried too many food options yet, but I have tried meatballs from one of the restaurants and they were really great.

We were recruited to try it out while we were standing in line at Pamela's and that was a mistake.  We all ordered the special of the day which was French toast with strawberries and bananas.   Twenty-five minutes after we placed our order they came to our table and told us they only had enough bread for 3 of the 4 orders.  I changed my order to an omelet and finally 45 minutes after we placed our original order some of the meals started coming out and it wasn't until about 55 minutes did we have all the orders.   Good thing we didn't want to eat together.  It wasn't like they were busy either, there were only 4 other groups having breakfast!  Should have stayed and waited at Pamela's!    The manager did come out apologize, which was nice.",

The cocktails were delicious and the company was perfect! Thank you for a great night Matt!!   The first time I went to The Pennsylvania Market on May 3rd, I was showing family around the city and decided to give this place a try even though it was dead on a Friday night. We were all blown away by the wonderful mixologist who was very pleasant and put on a great show for us. The four of us were the only ones sitting up at the cocktail bar and the drinks were delicious. We had a few drinks and made our way to the adjacent wine lounge where we relaxed and had a nice time.  On May 18th My husband and I went on a date night and decided to begin our night by going back for some pricey cocktails and relaxing ambiance. The place was busy in the courtyard but steady upstairs. We sat at the bar once again but this time we were not greeted and passed by several times.  The two female bartenders were chatting with one an other and the male bartender was making drinks and made eye contact several times. I finally leaned over the bar and flagged someone down. I was informed that they could not make 90% of the drinks because they were out of all the ingredients. When we finally were able to place our basic orders the female bartender stated she would not be making the mule because she WAS NOT cutting up limes. I am so mad we even ordered drinks. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this place. The attitude, lack of respect, and lack of couth from the bartenders was utterly shameful. How could this place decline so fast? To the females working there, you can wear all the skimpy clothes you want but your internal ugliness has shown your True colors. I have worked in food service and understand busy but common courtesy should be a given. Please remember customers provide revenue and without that you would not have a job. Treat everyone as you would like to be treated.",

It took both my mother and I having to be calm ourselves in order to deal with his attitude, whoever would treat someone like this that is paying lots of money and bringing lots 15+ people to your venue, who normally wouldn't go on their own.  3.  The bartenders are rude and SLOW.  I read on here that there was bad service and boy were they right.  They were snotty and very slow with a backed bar. 4.  The food was horrible, my poor guests.  The macaroni was dry and tasteless, the meatballs were gross.  The charcuterie board I could have done better at home  My guests told us that the food was bad.  So embarrassing.

These visits were much better than my first. All of the friends that I've introduced to the PA Market absolutely love it. The outdoor courtyard addition is another reason why I'm upping my review. I am always on the lookout for new outdoor spaces in Pittsburgh, and the courtyard was right up my alley.   The bar service got a lot better since they opened. Service is much quicker and the bartenders are more helpful in deciding between the wine offerings. The craft cocktails are also phenomenal, but my favorite is a classic Aperol Spritz!   On my next visit, I will be sure to try out the charcuterie, since that's the way to my heart.",

I still stand by Edgar's being the best establishment that serves food here. Definitely not the best tacos in Pittsburgh in my opinion, however they are good.  I felt compelled to update my review here because I had an awful experience that I would like the community to know about.   My coworkers and I decided to go here for lunch. They decided on tacos and I wanted something healthy, so I ventured upstairs to Bistro 108 for a salad. Not many people were there, maybe three others. I thought it was a little overkill that the young woman behind the counter gave me a buzzer for when my food would be ready. I ordered a citrus and avocado salad and it took about 25 minutes for me to get my food. My coworkers met me upstairs and agreed that it was taking a very long time. When my food finally came out, the buzzer did not even go off! The food was presented in a sad soup container packaged in a plastic bag which the young woman gave me. Ok customer service wasn't the best, I'm not sure why I waited so long for a mediocre salad. The kicker is, I didn't even get avocado in the salad even though it was called a citrus avocado salad. The chicken that I added was not worth it one bit, it almost doubled the price of my salad and it was for five pieces of slightly burnt chicken.  Value was not there at all.   Don't be fooled by the beautiful ambiance at Pennsylvania Market, especially the upstairs. I am confident in saying the food sucks.",

With an outdoor patio and a large upstairs with high tops, low tops, and a comfortable lounge there are a lot of options to sit and relax. They also have a big central bar in the middle of the large room which adds to the aesthetics. It's a great atmosphere to meet a group of friends.   The food and drinks however, have been sub par. Edible but not noteworthy or worth the cost. The sole reason to come is for the atmosphere. We also went on a Sunday hoping to sit on the patio and grab some food, and their outdoor patio food market does not sell food on Sundays. Not ideal!",

That'd be my biggest and only complaint. Otherwise the staff was friendly and I enjoyed it all. I'd definitely return since it offers a unique environment, is accessible by bus from downtown, and is located near other places in the strip.",

This is more like a haven for wine drinking suburbanite women needing a few glasses (after a day at the office) before heading back to their South Hills soccer mom lives.  Definitely a wanna-be pretentious, douchie crowd.  I absolutely prefer East End Taproom that's right next door.  Ate at the pizza place and it was ok. Nothing at all to write home about. At all.  Also, let me be perfectly clear that I am referring only to the actual Pennsylvania Market which is on the second floor. The businesses on first floor (East End, wine shop, Olive Tap) are all locally owned and operated and were in place before the upstairs became a douchie existence. The downstairs businesses are amazing! Please do support them.   Bottom line: blah.",

We sat in the wine bar area and although that is connected to a different bar, their systems are separate so you couldn't order from both at the same time. The waits were a bit long at the bar as well and it wasn't very crowded. Someone in our group ordered steak and frites and the \"frites\" were undercooked home fries.   If they work out some of the kinks here and give it a less fractured feel, it could be a great place. However, it has a way to go.",

Plenty of seating available.  We tried Pizza from Romulus .. it was no doubt different and delicious at the same time.  The pizza is crunchy.. so might not be for everyone.  It's the type of pizza you must eat right away or might be too hard sitting out at room temperature.   We also tried a meat plate from Charcuterie.. which was fun and well presented.    Nice beer selection but no craft beers.   If you are a wine lover.. theres plenty here for you.    There was so much more to explore as far as food.  I look forward to returning. The prices are as expected for a \"hotspot\" above average.   We explored the outdoor patio area and it was spacious and charming.  I can't wait to experience when the weather warms up.  What stood out the most is out friendly everyone was .. no matter what area we explored inside - everyone was super friendly and nice.. it was quite refreshing.  Thanks PA Market.

My friends made their way to the bar for drinks and I needed food.   I got the pepperoni pizza, which is my favorite, and it was LOADED with pepperoni. A nice chew to the crust, and less than 5 bucks. The 2 guys working there were really friendly and they brought it out to me on the deck where we were sitting when it was ready.   The charcuterie boards looked amazing too, would love to come back where with my husband for a couple glasses of one and have one of those.",

There is a full bar with local beer options and plenty of wine / spirits to choose from. Our table had a variety of the craft cocktails, bloody mary's, and a few beers.

One guy came from the back to the bar where we were trying to order bloody's and said he'd get us our drinks and make it happen. I appreciate that he was trying to please the guests, but the bloody's were bland and tasted mostly like tomato juice. I saw them making a larger batch of bloody mix later (perhaps they get a bigger crowd later on?) and they seemed to be making it better (worcestershire, hot sauce, etc.).   What saved this review was the food. I had the steak and eggs. Steak was perfectly cooked with great char and salt/taste. Even the potatoes had a crispy salt crust and were delicious. My partner had the shakshuka and was a fan as well. I'd definitely go back to try some other food options. We ordered from Bistro 108 and I could see the pizza place and taco place setting up for later but they didn't seem to be open whwn we were there for brunch.",

We actually made it for happy hour during the week and I had a wine flight and a glass which were amazing. Sarah our bartender was  and helped us so much.  The atmosphere was also just great. Neat interior vibe. There was a pasta making class going on while we were there which looked super fun. I was sad we hadn't gotten tickets for it.  Now the reason for my 3 stars...food. I tried a few dishes from various spots on the second floor and were not impressed. I had the calamari which was underdone and the cocktail sauce it was served with needed something. I also had the Brussels sprouts from bistro 108. They were in desperate need of salt and pepper and even then, they were extremely greasy.   My husband on the other hand had the short rib from nibbles and a slice of pizza and liked both. Sooo maybe this is just a classic case of bad ordering?  Either way I would check it out again. For suuure the bar. Just maybe order different food than I did :)",

I was told that they only had one and the bartender would have to find it. We were also told that they were out of a lot of beers on the menu. Once I was given the menu, I was told by the bartender that she didn't know how to make half of the drinks, which was confirmed when she told me to \"try again\" with the first two drinks that I tried to order. This was a Saturday night! A busy one! Wouldn't you think that they'd be stocked and ready to serve? I'm not sure that we'll be going back.",

The market is on two floors with an outdoor area containing tables, an olive oil shop, an outdoor bar, and entrance to the East End Brewing taproom. The upper floor has a wine library with inviting chesterfield sofas as well as another bar, a restaurant, and pizza shop. You order food from the counters and take a buzzer to your table or the bar. We sat at the bar and ate pork belly, short ribs, truffle fries, and baked macaroni and cheese from the restaurant. The chef was extremely engaging and made sure to modify a few things to make them dairy-free for me! Everything was delicious, but the short ribs really stood out for me.   There's plenty of room for expansion throughout the building, and I can't wait to come back and see how the space evolves. The grand opening is in November, so I'll most certainly be there for that as well. If you haven't yet been, come down to the strip and support one of the most exciting things to open in Pittsburgh in the last five years.",
