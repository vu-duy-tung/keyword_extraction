The cafe is pretty nice to work in...free WiFi and a departure from typical coffee shops (Starbucks, Coffee Tree Roasters)",

    "text": "Ok it was a little weird ... because I know I attended funerals here.  You would never know it was previously a funeral home.  Let's start with the front door ... it is a huge tube of coffee beans.   The hostess will not seat you until your entire party has arrived.  That's OK because lots of seating at the well stocked bar.  We started with lots of appetizers.  The fried zucchini was literally 1 zucchini cut in half and half again ... HUGE spears served with a Wasabi sauce.  I had the pork tacos sans shells ... lots of flavor.  The bruschetta  was very good too.   For dinner we had shrimp, pasta, and 2 dinner size salads.  Everyone would order their meals again.  I was the only person who ordered dessert.  It was a little cake with apricot preserves, whipped cream, and mint leaves ... it wasn't what I expected from the menu description but it satisfied my sweet tooth.  Lots of on street and parking lot spaces available.  We ate indoors but many took advantage of the summer weather on the large patio.  It had a small yet diverse menu to meet the dietary and preferences of everyone at the table.  Apparently they open at 6 am ish as a coffee shop and stay open all day transitioning into restaurant ....  Great concept .... good location.  We'll be back.",

I asked an employee if there was one somewhere else in the restaurant and was told 'no, I'm sorry. We're really not kid friendly.' He apologized again. I then asked if I could change my 7 month old on a bench and was told by another employee that for sanitary reasons, I could not. I said well where can I change her and simply received a shrug and I'm sorry for sanitary reasons...  no highchairs or boosters. Food was decent but I was pretty much just trying to contain my disappointment through what should have been a nice afternoon with friends.",

I accepted and sat down on the couch to wait for my friends. They arrived 15 minutes later and we were informed there were no longer any tables available in the entire restaurant and that there would be an 1.5 hour wait...yet only one quarter of the tables were full. If indeed there were only a few tables left when I arrived, I do not understand why I was not informed then and there or a reservation made for my group. There was no apology or sincerity from any of the front of house employees. At this point we gave up and left. Very disappointing employees. Cannot comment on the food.",

There are four different parts to the Abbey, but i have only experienced the bar area the couple of times I have been here. They tend to have a nice variety of beer, as well as mixed drinks.  My first experience here included the Provolone Bacon Burger and I opted for the Pork Rinds in place of the pasta salad. The burger was huge (at least by my standards), but nothing really stood out about it and the pork rinds were absolutely delicious. My dinner partner had the scotch duck eggs and the shepherds pie. Both looked good and he seemed to enjoy them.  I recommend this place if you are ever in Lawrenceville and want want somewhere to grab a drink and a bite to eat.",

    "text": "I've now been here about 5 times, and my experiences have been all over the spectrum. The concept is awesome and space absolutely lovely, the coffee is decent and the cocktails are OK (hit or miss), the food in the coffeeshop was also hit-or-miss, and the service leaves much to be desired.  I really had high hopes for this place, and I still do really hope that it succeeds. One of my absolute favorite hangout spots in my hometown is a coffeeshop/bar hybrid called Northside Social. I was hoping that this might be my Pittsburgh version of that.  Who doesn't want to transition seamlessly from coffeeshop working to grabbing a beer with friends, without even moving!  The first time I visited was during the soft opening. I had a killer blackberry espresso cocktail that was unique and delicious. My partner's cocktail was decent as well.  The bartenders were very slow, and reading off of recipe cards, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was opening week.  However, it was clear that they had not hired opening staff who had extensive experience mixing specialty (on-the-menu) or classic cocktails.  I then came twice to work in the coffeeshop space during the day. They brew Commonplace Coffee beans here, and the results are quite decent.  However, my coffeeshop snacking experiences have been mixed.  I have had a delicious peanut butter cookie, an OK cheesecake slice that was a little too cloyingly sweet for me, and the wrap of the day that seemed to have fresh ingredients but VERY bizarre flavors.  Until this point, I had enjoyed the vibe of this place.  The fourth time I visited was on a Friday night, and it was extremely crowded. Furthermore, the type of crowd it had drawn gave the bar a soulless feeling reminiscent of that at Industry Public House, except with a less impressive beer selection and slightly higher prices.  My cocktails were OK, but definitely nothing to write home about. Don't expect consistency if you're a craft cocktail kind of person. Also, you can get cocktails that are just as tasty, and often better, at Spirit for cheaper.  The service was really struggling during my last visit.  They seemed kind of disorganized about seating, when we asked to sit outside.  There were tons of empty tables and yet for some reason we had to wait for some server issue to resolve before we were allowed to sit there.  Our server made us feel quite rushed, bringing the check after we had only had one round.  He did bring us a second round upon request but then rushed our checkout, saying that he had worked a 12 hour shift and was looking to get out of there. He also asked us if we were looking for a job, because apparently servers have been quitting and they need more.  Although I absolutely love the space, both inside and out (the fountain is very nice and relaxing), the service kind of killed my last experience. I will occasionally come back for coffee and to work here during the AM, but The Abbey is no longer on my short list for drinking!",

    "text": "The first time I walked in I thought it was a little weird, the idea of drinking, eating, laughing in a former funeral home. Also, potentially the idea of it being haunted. But I assure you, I was not haunted, other than by too many drinks the next morning!  For Lawrencveville, it's a really large space. There's a front room with a large bar and seating area, and then there's a smaller back bar with more tables for dining. And maybe the best part, there's a huge patio with a beautiful fountain in the center. Perfect for warm summer nights!  But not only is this place a bar and restaurant, but it also houses a coffee bar, in another huge room with couches and tables to lounge at. I haven't gotten to partake in the daytime activities here, but I'm looking forward to working/hosting meetings here soon.   I've had a couple of dishes from the kitchen as well. The winners have been the Sriracha Chicken Dip, Grilled Shrimp and Rosemary White Beans, and the Abbey Normal Mac and Cheese (so good!!). They were all great and super flavorful choices.  However, the Tempura Battered Zucchini would have been better crispier and seasoned more and the Bahn mi Bruschetta's pork was a little tough.   Specialty cocktails are $10 and they are fantastic! The first one I had hooked me, the Recycled Paper Plane (bourbon, Aperol, Ramazzotti, lemon juice). It was spectacular and it's hard to not order that every time I'm there. I did switch it up once and ordered up a glass up Rose... Yay for Rose being on menu!   Glad to have this spot open, as it will probably be one of my go to places in the 'ville!",

The Abbey won't get another dime from us. We'll go to The Urban Tap on Highland. The owner there visited our table numerous times to make sure we were well taken care of and had everything we needed.  They get one star, because I can't give zero...

I've been there for breakfast/coffee in the morning, I've been there for lunch, and I've been there for dinner, so I've tried every day part.  Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is dreadful, but it is convenient. We met some friends there yesterday and it was terrible. It started out with me asking for ice tea for my drink and the server told me they didn't have any iced tea because they didn't have any tea bags (which I thought was odd since they have a whole coffee bar there). So my second choice was a ginger ale. I was served a room temperature, flat soda, so I asked if I could get a new one with ice and it was \"no problem.\"  I was going to order the salad I usually get for dinner (the Southwest St. Mary's with grilled shimp) and was told that it's only on the lunch menu. They have a new menu and it was after lunch so this salad is not an option for dinner. I mean, how hard is it to make a Cobb salad? So I opted for the veggie burger. It was okay. The pasta salad that came with it didn't have much flavor to it. If it wasn't for the friends we met there and the good company, I would have been kind of upset over this meal and the service. Maybe they were having an off day. But with all the choices that Lawrenceville is now offering, they should tighten their ship.",

I've had a wonderful steak for dinner, a very enjoyable Cuban sandwich for lunch (though, not as good as my favorite at Kaya), my husband really enjoyed his Shepard's pie, and he loves the pub chips. The bar area is fun with a wide variety of craft beers, cocktails, and wine offerings. The service is fantastic. I love the outdoor area in nice weather, very comfortable. My only complaint is that we took our son when he was just a year old and they didn't have high chairs or lidded cups- they might now, though. I'm not sure. It prompted me to ask if they preferred kids not dine there and they were all \"we love kids!\" So that was reassuring. I do not mind the lack of kids meal options, he really liked the Mac and cheese and shared it with his older sibling!!",

It's a former funeral home, so think lots of dark wood, cool light fixtures, and a fireplace. Different rooms/areas offer different environments and perspectives. Really nice place to hang out.  The food is just entirely mediocre, whether we're talking bar snacks, dinner, or breakfast. For example, I have yet to order any kind of burger or meat at this place which isn't overcooked. At this point, I just never eat here by choice.  I would say that the staff aren't always the most welcoming. The bartenders can be aloof, there's a bit of pickiness around the seating areas (never been an issue for me, but I've witnessed multiple huffy customer interactions over this), and the baristas aren't particularly attentive (I've been handed the wrong drink order on multiple occasions, which is weird, 'cause I order some pretty basic stuff and don't mumble). Which. Honestly. It's fine. It's just not the kind of place where you feel a connection to anything or anyone.   I do like the coffee-bar area--it's dark, but a nice place to sit and work. There aren't a ton of tables in the space, so depending on when you arrive, it can be a bit crowded. Decent outlet situation along the wall tables. The coffee drinks are serviceable. They do have some nice pastry options, usually.  All in all, the Abbey is a fun place to sit with friends over beer or coffee.",

    "text": "I've never had a bad meal at the Abbey. The service has always been prompt and the food has always been freshly prepared and delicious. But what you really come here for is the atmosphere.  The Abbey succeeds in creating an upscale English-style pub, complete with a dining room, cafe, cozy sitting room, and breathtaking outdoor patio with a large fountain in the summer. It's a crazy mash-up of three different facilities that somehow just works.  When you walk in you step directly into a small foyer that leads to the bar, which feels like a dark, warm and cozy pub. There are typical bar-top tables and chairs as well as a small window nook to the right  that has lower seating. On your left  is a wall of frosted glass with inset doors. Step through them and enter into the cafe's sitting room, with a large fire in the antique fireplace crackling away, and several lowslung leather chaises and sofas to rest in. Framing the fireplace are french doors out onto the patio, where a grand fountain spouts elegant water displays in the summer while your brunch outdoors. At the far end of the room is the cafe's ordering counter, which has a large, heavy round cathedral window as its chandelier. At the back of the cafe and pub area is the dining room/bistro, where you can make reservations and wait to be seated. It wraps around the closed kitchen and has a secondary bar and additional booth seating reminiscent of pub-style eateries. High on the walls wrapping around the building are the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody, and every room is cast in a soft orange glow.  Now that you are warm and comfortable, enjoy a wide variety of dark and rich drafts, from smooth IPAs to nitro milk stouts. Then order the filling beer-battered chicken and mashed potatoes or bangers and mash. In the mood for something lighter? Get a specialty mixed drink like their \"Bohemian Raspberry\" or summer sangria alongside a salmon salad or grilled shrimp and rosemary bean starter. Every dish I've eaten there takes the traditional (like fish and chips) and adds a twist, whether it be a coffee rub, a curry sauce, or a sweet and sour spread.  The Abbey is one of my favorite places to hang out in Pittsburgh, hands down. If you haven't been there yet you are missing out.",

They are awesome and always extremely friendly! If you haven't been to the Abbey, you HAVE to check it out!",

One huge chandelier is made of a large rose window with stained glass that's been turned on its side. Other details include ceilings that are painted gold.   My chicken & waffles was memorable & delicious with crispy fried chicken sandwiched between warm waffles. Salad was tasty too with fresh lettuce & tangy dressing. Brownie with vanilla ice cream was a decadent desert.",

They do have outdoor seating, so I'd like to check that out perhaps on a warm summer evening. Staff was so friendly and welcoming! Coffee tasted amazing (i got a free refill!)

    "text": "Let's begin with I've lived in Lawrenceville 3 years and frequently eat out. My gut instincts told me never to eat The Abbey, until yesterday. We wanted to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. If you read nothing else. Do not eat there. 3 of us ended up with FOOD POISONING. We live here and own businesses here and will never ever refer The Abbey. I eat out daily in this neighborhood, this experience was atrocious.   So after arriving around 3:48, they wouldn't seat us outside. It was the transition for servers so they weren't ready. I said OK I'll grab a drink at the bar then let us know when you're ready for us. Dinner service begins at 4:00.   Realizing no one is going to come seat us or let us know the dining room is open we head towards the abandon host station. 3 people at this point are wondering around searching for restaurant employees. Finally we see a familiar face, an old friend so ask his help to find his colleagues. He emerges from a back room with a manager, a host, some servers. Alas. The holy grail.   After being seated in the sun. We look at the overwhelmingly large menu compilation. Our server thinks everything is \"reallllly good!!\" So that's no help. The special was a fish and cheese salad??? The menus....Like you need to save money soooo badly you can't have a drink menu, lunch and dinner menu? It's like a 5 lb book and it's a lot to take in.   So we order mussels, burger with a salad, chicken salad, an extra crostini, 2 beers and 2 bloody Mary's   The mussels $13 were absolutely disgusting. Overcooked, fishy, rubbery. Crostini $2 was stale and we didn't eat it. Didn't even touch the burger. $13 Ate the salad $2 only. We did let our server know her response \"awwww really???\" Like bro. You're always hiring cooks. For a reason. Yes really.   So we paid around $70 plus $18 tip.   Came home gave the burger to my friend.   THANKS GUYS for the horrible service and the food poisoning. All 3 of us ended up sick.",

We stopped for my friend to get a juice or tea but the selections of teas wasn't grabbing her. We did love the setting, the coffee choices and restaurant side looked like something we will do next time in town. Just passed in and it was fun! Sorry peeps I shouldn't give that many stars just on looks alone but this time I'm breaking my rules.",

Keep in mind that the portions of dessert are really small. Overall, the place has good quality food but they could work on service as it was hard to get the attention of our waitress.",

    "text": "I visited The Abbey on Butler Street with some colleagues for a late weekday lunch. There was no shortage of tables/seating though I am sure it gets quite busy on weekends. Our server was very friendly and attentive.  There's quite a large selection of adult beverages - I got the impression this list was rotated fairly regularly as well so there should be something for everybody. We started with two appetizers - the sriracha chicken dip and edamame hummus. Both were very tasty and certainly large enough to accommodate our party of four.  For the main course, the majority of my group had burgers. The menu (for lunch at least) doesn't have an overabundance of options, but there should be at least one or two items to suit everyone's taste. Side options include fries, pasta salad, or a side salad - a nice touch to have additional choices. The burgers were quite tasty and cooked accurately to our requested temperatures.  All in all, we had a very positive experience here. The ambiance is unique and warm. Location-wise, parking is a little easier here than on some stretches of Butler Street further down, so that's also a plus. Definitely check The Abbey out if you're looking for places to eat in Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "Today was the first time we've had their Sunday brunch. It was good. Our party had the Monte Cristo Sandwich, Salmon Eggs Benedict, and two people had Chicken and Waffles. We also had zucchini bread, a fruit/yogurt platter and bacon as starters to share while waiting for our main meals. The starters took exceptionally long though (not sure why as the only thing that had to be cooked was the bacon), which was disappointing and rather annoying since we were hungry. We were also afraid that they weren't going to come as starters since it was taking a long time. Our waiter was nice, but it was very hard to get his attention to check on them. We finally did and luckily our starters came out as starters....whew! The bacon portion was a bit scarce for the price in my opinion, although good. We also had Bellinis and my BF had a beer, which were all good. The only downside was that when we were seated outside per our request (nowhere to note this in the reservation I made online though), we were seated in quite a sunny four top with the large umbrella only over one of us. The hostess commented something like \"the sun had moved I guess because this was the shadiest seat outside.\" Hmmm...it was the sunniest seat, but we made it work. My BF ended up moving the umbrella a bit to shade all of us, but it would've been nice for the hostess to do that when we were seated to make us more comfortable since there are plenty of umbrellas to shade the tables in the outside area.",

    "text": "Just my opinion, but I think the needs some prayers!!!!  Great location!  Lovely atmosphere!!!  But the food and and wait staff needs some serious religion!!!!!  I've been there twice and found the menu and the taste of things I thought would be wonderful but not so!!!  To be honest, I cannot remember what I ate the first time but the second time I had some sort of vegetable, egg and chorizo breakfast bowl that had almost no seasoning, the egg yolk was pretty much well done, I decided not to eat but a few bites!!!  I pushed it aside and no one ever asked if my food was ok!!  Then my son and 7yr old grandson joined me and the waiter can to take his order, between him and I we could not find \"picky\" kid friendly - no children's menu, no special requests allowed - I asked if they make him a fruit bowl as many of the menu items mentioned fresh fruit ingredients - \"No, we don't do that, I said \"wow, not kid friendly then, eh??\"  No reply!  I asked why they'd over cooked the egg in my meal - \"that's just how we do it\". But the real bite in the butt was when we were leaving and stopped by the coffee shop to get one to go and see if they had any baked goods my grandson, who had not eaten at all to this point, that he would eat......and there were, so good, right???  But in the cooler beside the counter, well what do you know.....an entire row of fresh fruit cups!!!!!!  But it didn't occur to our waiter (there were two, one trainee and one trainer) but apparently neither either knew what the coffee shop sold or it was not important at all to find my grandson anything to munch on - I specifically asked them fresh fruit, a muffin, mac n cheese, grilled cheese, but no on everything!!!  If I were the Managment, I be on my knees begging the universe for a better menu, better chefs and better employees with waaaay better attitudes!!!  Seriously, there was just a tone of aloofness and disinterest in authentic customer service!!!!  When I was on the corporate side of my life, there was a saying that \"sh$t rolls downhill\" so perhaps management sets the snotty disposition for the staff???  I didn't meet anyone in charge either time I went and I didn't ask to since I was copping a bit of an attitude myself and didn't want to contribute any additional negativity!!!  So, yes, the three stars are for the location and decor/ambience - but without decent food and service I don't plan to  go back!!",

One of our five person group just wanted to sit in the sunshine for a moment, and our heinous server practically grabbed the guy's arm to make him sit at the table that was set for us.   There was only one other table sat on a 20+ table dining area so it wasn't busy, and it's a freakin' Monday. Four times, he was enforcing the \"rules\" of the restaurant, that we MUST be seated at our table. After the final insult, we got up and left. This place is run by stressed out, tyrant-led jerks.   I will never go to Abbey again.  Instead, spent $175 at Industry and had a great, chill experience.  I hope someone cool can manage this place in the future  I understand how difficult it must be to try to meet the needs of daters, workers, spenders, etc. And allow for the right people in the right micro-venues in their space.

Hey It's was Saturday night in Larryville so it can be tough to park.       We walked into Abbey's a little confused on where to go.  It was an odd shaped place for a restaurant/bar.  It has a long hallway when you first walk in.  We could see the bar to the right of us but there were a lot of things going on in other areas.  So we just walked into the crowded bar.  There was no room at the bar so we found a tabletop for two in a corner.  My wife went to the ladies room and when she came back a spot did open up at the bar so we made a dash for it and got two bar stools!         Once we got settled in it turned out to be a pretty cool bar.  It wasn't too hard to get a bartender and they were cool too.   I liked the atmosphere and the shape of the bar.  You can see their televisions very easily and they looked good.  The drink selections looked really good until we found out that our first beer choices were tapped out all ready.  That was a little disappointing but I was able to find a Oktoberfest that I liked and my wife enjoyed her drinks too.  They were busy so that's understandable about running out of beer.       If you're out in Lawrenceville this is a place that you should definitely check out.  Grab some drinks and get some food.  We looked at their brunch and lunch menu for a possible return visit.  I'm not sure if the brunch is for us but the lunch menu looks like something we would like to try and their coffee bar sounds really good too.  This is a place we will come back to in the evening when we are in Lawrenceville and we will be back for lunch on a weekend sometime soon.",

The waitress was super friendly and helpful with explaining the special and offering suggestions for appetizers and giving recommendations for dinner.    The drinks alone are worth a visit!  I tried the Bourbon Sunrise and the PB&J Old Fashioned while my fiancee had the Hot Mess - all three were wonderful, and strong!   For our meals, we started with the homemade focaccia bread with peppers and oil - it was nothing short of fabulous!  There was just  the right amount of heat to the peppers and the olive tapenade added a nice touch.  We then split the house salad which was made from local ingredients and had a very light dressing that was enjoyable and super fresh.  For dinner, I had the steak frites with the coffee rub which was cooked to perfection and super flavorful! My fiancee tried the Maid's Chicken and was blown away!  The style of cooking makes the meat so juicy and tender, it falls right off of the bone.  The potatoes that came with the chicken were also noteworthy!  I'm not a fan of dark meat, but I actually will order that dish when we make it back.     Throughout our time there, the waitress continued to check-in with us and was super friendly.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "TLDR: The service is terrible, the owner is an asshole, and dismisses the purchases of patrons while calling them \"freeloaders\".   On on this somber, rainy-- very characteristically Pittsburgh-- Saturday, my friends and I trudged into The Abbey prepared to spend another Saturday studying. We are accustomed to being greeted warmly when we enter a business. In this particular instance --on what had to be our 9th visit to this business in 3 weeks-- we received no such greeting. Instead, the bartender-- a young woman whose name I did not have the foresight to request-- simply stared at us and went back to her work of organizing the menus.  After setting down our bags, I went to request a menu (from The Bartender who had still not acknowledged us) and went to order myself breakfast and a drink.  Fast forward a couple of hours, and we had asked this bartender couple of questions, each which was met with an acerbic response. Of course we noticed, but we just smiled and met her disposition with warmth.  Lunchtime comes and my friend left The Abbey to go get lunch.   As she's sitting down eating her food, The Bartender-- who had refused to acknowledge us otherwise-- comes over looking and sounding quite hostile.  \"You can't eat that in here\" she says. My friend, with a bite of food in her mouth, looks up in confusion.  \"I'm sorry?\" I ask.  \"You can't bring outside food in here. This is a business. You can't just sit here and use the wifi and eat outside food\"   Ignoring the condescension, I reply \"oh, we've already bought some things here if that is the problem.\"  To which she replied \"No, you just can't have anything from another restaurant. We sell food here, so you have to put that away.\"   So, after finishing the bite that she had in her hand, my friend puts her food back in the container, puts the container in the bag, and we offer no more objection. The Bartender walked away seeming even more perturbed than before, but my friend and I shrugged it off, and got back to the ever-present work that accompanies med school.   A moment later, another employee comes from the back of the restaurant, talks to the bartender, then stares at us. After 10 minutes of her staring at us suspiciously and walking circling the area where we were, I look up and ask  \"Can we help you\" with a smile. She seemed surprised at my question and responded \"yes... is everything OK over here?\"  \"yep\", I reply. \"I just noticed that you were staring at us, so we wondered if there was something you needed from us?\"   I will say that I'm not too good at nice nasty. I don't like to beat around the bush. I'm direct. You're looking at us, like we've done something wrong, so what's good??  \"Well I heard that you had outside food, and I just wanted to make sure that you'd put it away.\"   \"We put the food away as soon as she asked us to\", I replied. \"Okay, then there's no problem\" the second employee states.   We attempt for the second time to return to work and ignore the situation which seemed to be escalating. A mere moment later, the owner-- an older white gentleman -- walked up to our table.   The owner approaches and the FIRST thing he says is \"Hi, I'm the owner of this place, and I don't want outside food here.\" To which I replied \"Yes, and my friend put it away THE FIRST TIME, when she was asked\".  He then launches into a diatribe: \" I have worked too hard and spent too much money to build this business up to let people come in here and just do what they want. This is a business. Why would you bring outside food in here?\" At this point he was raising his voice.    The situation quickly deescalated from there, and included the following: --the owner yelling at us that we needed to get out --him assuring us that his business was not a cafeteria --him accusing us of being nasty and aggressive with his employees --being told that we just wanted to come use the wifi without supporting the business --the fact that --the fact that we were REPEAT customers there being ignored --being told that the fact that we'd already purchased things didn't matter (What'd you spend, like $3?) --being told that the way that his employees had treated us did not matter --being called freeloaders --getting yelled at for bringing water bottles in (because they supposedly sell water bottles--despite the fact that there is a water pitcher set out forguests to use) -- Me attempting to explain the story in a rational way --Me attempting to understand why this was becoming such an ordeal --Me realizing that it was not about the damned food --Me asking if he treats all of his customers who may break a rule this way --and being told that we were not welcome there  Iwas horrified by what was transpiring. I have lived most of my life in the south (Georgia specifically), and despite that fact, I had NEVER been treated like that before. We were paying customers in this establishment. We broke a rule, but we immediately complied with the staff after that.",

I heard there was a vegan option for lunch, and with dinner menus normally encompassing more of what the restaurant can serve, I would have thought that there would be at least one vegan option for dinner. This expectation led to a major disappointment and made me simply not want to eat there. For the location in the city, I would expect more from this restaurant in its ability to accommodate those with dietary restrictions.",

Upon walking in to an empty podium and waiting for 15 minutes, the hostess who from this point forth will be known as \"the awful employee\" told us that tables were available they just had to be bused.  The awful employee then 20 minutes later said that the tables would not be able to be bused for 30-60 minutes because they are really busy. As this occurs the awful employee's coworkers lean lazily against the coffee bar. Anecdote if I am the hostess I am going to clear the tables myself. The awful employee then recommended sitting at the bar with a finger point.  We ask if we can push tables together to which the awful employee said yes. Shortly there after the awful employee complained our tables blocked the path. The awful employee never provides menus which we found on our own. Moral to the story she sucked and the management of the location was abysmal.    Now to the positive: -food: tasty. Sriracha dip was fantastic.  -ambience: awesome and very nice -bartender: he was fantastic and set up to fail. Probably managing 40 guests as a solo artist  More negative: -3 waitresses attempted to serve plates we did not order   In the end we can't wait to watch our soccer games and celebrate st patty's day when this place fails and reopens as an Irish pub.",

It's not a fancy place where one would have to worry. It's casual.  When we arrived, we found out they do not have high chairs. We asked if we could sit in a booth and we would make it work. They stated they did have booths but they were holding them for other customers. They did apologize but I wish they would have found is a way to dine as we drove thirty minutes, it was not busy when we arrived, and nothing on their website said no highchairs available. Technically our LO could have dined there but they didn't make an effort to accommodate him. It's hard dining with a child so it would have been nice if they made a note on their website or reservation system about not being child friendly as it's super casual. They really could have put us in one of the empty booths. Bummer. They could have handled the situation better. This makes me wonder how we would have been treated if we did dine.",

To be fair, we did not call ahead so we sat at the bar.  We've done this for dinner before and have always had decent experiences, so we thought this would be okay.  But they only had ONE bartender/server working.  To her credit, she busted her butt to get things done.  But it took 45 minutes just for us to get drinks from anyone in the establishment- and they got them wrong.  If a restaurant is going to pride itself on brunch, have more than one person tending bar.  Secondly, we arrived when brunch still had two hours left- and there was NO food at the buffet.  There were probably ten or so pans of food in the buffet area and only four with remnants of food.  Out of everything, we were able to eat some sad, leftover pineapple from the fruit salad, a smushed perogi, and a hard biscuit.   Not what I expect when paying $18.00/person.  It's going to take awhile to get us back there.  Step it up, Abbey.",

I love coming here to drink at all times of the day and their food is incredible. Pro tip: the Mac and cheese is the best thing on the menu. You may have a heart attack after eating it, but it's worth it.   The service leaves something to be desired. They always seem to be understaffed on servers, but will have 2-3 hostess' at the podium. Don't know why that's necessary. A handful of times that I've been here the food has come out before a drink, which is odd.   The only other thing that I don't like about this place is that the entire staff is kind of pretentious. It's a really nice space, but they talk to you like you just entered a fancy restaurant in downtown rather than Lawrenceville where the clientele is mostly young and casual.   They also have very strict rules about drinking on the patio and you are not allowed to have a table unless you're also ordering food, so you're limited to one couch and 2 high top tables if you're just going for drinks. No service to the outside for drinks either.   All in all, I will definitely continue going here and hope that the service issue will get better over time.",

The pretzel appetizer has changed and is now served as three logs which are more the consistency of a breadstick than a True pretzel.   I also ordered of my all time favorite comfort food plates, the mac n cheese with fried chicken.   It's no longer a favorite.  The portion was reduced, no longer cheesy and one small piece of boneless chicken breast.  I was terribly disappointed.   The pasta was barely covered in a very loose, runny sauce with very little flavor.    Now terribly overpriced.....   I also considered a bowl of hearty soup.   My only option was a hot and sour type ramen soup in vinegar broth with tofu....what part of that sounds good?  At least they still had a good selection of draft beers on hand.",

    "text": "The Abbey... the long awaited bar finally opened in Lawrenceville. It's just a stones throw from the apartment I live in, so I've been dying for this place to finally open. I peeked in during construction, which was breathtaking. Happy to see it's finally finished and just as gorgeous as I imagined it would be.  The drinks are great!  I had the Butler Mule and a few other cocktails of which the names escape me. Everything tasted good. The butler mule is like an Irish (or Dublin) mule without the bitters.  I think it would be PERFECT with a dash of bitters, but that's my personal preference. (Sorry I'm always a bartender at heart) We eventually got a table and ordered some food. Appetizer was the fried green tomatoes with a balsamic sauce, they were very good. Slightly small portions but that never bothers me much. There were three slices of tomato, breaded, fried, and drizzled. For dinner we all ordered steak. Here's where I have a bit of an issue, not much but a bit... My steak was a tad overdone, and perhaps that's on me for ordering medium-rare. My boyfriend ordered rare. My sister ordered medium. The boyfriends steak was more medium rare, my steak was bordering on medium/medium-well. It tasted great and wasn't a huge deal breaker. I suppose we should have asked prices, as the steaks were the special and the waiter seemed a little flustered and we didn't want to make him feel more so. He did a great job reading the specials, and seemed a little bit nervous but that was endearing. The slight overcook on the steak aside... everything tasted very good.  I look forward to coming for brunch!  I can't wait to try more things on the menu! (Sriracha Chicken Dip I'm looking at you!!!).  I have a few friends that also work there, which is even more incentive to return!",

All around crappy food. No high chairs for children. Wait staff was very nice and great atmosphere. Was very disappointed- I've had lunch here before and it was decent. For $45 I would have expected better tasting and better presented food. I love going to my local neighborhood restaurants, but the entire experience was subpar and I won't be back. I've had better food at a hospital. Going to barbs corner kitchen from now on.",

    "text": "I am a little hesitant to review after one visit, and on opening week...but I'm going to.    This is a solid place, but unfortunately it is surrounded by superior places (Vandal, Cure, Piccolo Forno etc...) It is pretty cool looking, but the unique concept seems to cover up the \"a'ight\" food.  We ordered a round of appetizers, tempura zucchini, chicken skewers, and grilled shrimp.  *UGLY AMERICAN COMMENT ALERT...the portions were a bit small given the price point.  I wasn't looking to throw a few pounds on the fast track to the 'betes, but I was kind of hungry afterwards.  Also enjoyed cocktails, but they were just average.    The service was fine, but they seemed a little confused at handling the outside service.  I am okay with this, since this it was the first week.  I have to say again, the restaurant LOOKS great, but Great restaurants don't need a ton of atmosphere to succeed (Cure is basically in a   cabin in a building that looks dilapidated on the outside).  You could probably argue that it is a little confused of a concept, as the coffee house seems a little unnecessary and could potentially clash with the rest of the restaurant/bar area.  I will probably try to go back, but nothing is hooking me yet, and therefore won't be in a rush.  I may go for coffee sometime though.   Let's hope they get that extra push with the food as the chef gets a little more adventurous.  The fact that they do have parking certainly helps in Lawrenceville.  I sincerely hope they enforce it for customer's only, because they paid for the space and it should go to supporting their business  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Sublime.  Their music was okay (I never dug it, but I understood their appeal to a select few), but they got some unwarranted props as a whole because the lead singer died and you can't speak ill of the dead.",

If you want to be treated like a customer who pays for a service instead of being treated like a hinderance consider going pretty much anywhere else in Pittsburgh. My friends and I are from out of town and came here after dinner for some drinks and to watch the basketball game. It was fairly late, close to 11- I tried to order an iced tea from the coffee shop-- they said they were out of...ice? It's a bar and restaurant...do the owners not care that their waitstaff is losing them money? My friend asked if we could turn one of the TVs to the game and got a very rude NO. Then my friends ordered a drink OFF THE MENU and were given the run around by their excuse for a bartender for 5 minutes before being told no. Then when we were sitting there were just watching the staff close down the patio...at 11....3 hours before they close. Again, these owners must not be concerned with making money because we would have easily spent $150 as a group of pretty hard drinkers. But we had one drink and left.",

    "text": "Just came home from a beautiful evening at the Abbey. The patio is glorious on a summer night. Our server rates five stars, the food, four. The drinks...two stars. Lovely space, as everyone knows. My husband had the shepherds pie, which, even with the server's warning that it was more like a stew, he didn't like because it was too soupy. I had the cobb-like salad which was fantastic. I had misgivings about the chipotle ranch dressing but it was really good.  Now the drinks. We're cocktail nerds so I can't talk about the beer (or wine). My husband had the vieux carre (twice), and that was quite good. I had three different drinks that were subpar. The \"THIS IS NOT A SPRITZ\" was amazingly tasteless for something with so many good ingredients in. Ditto the White Negroni. Both of these suffered from tiny ice cubes that watered down the drink immediately. Any bar not using 2\" ice cubes in their highball glasses is just out of step with the rest of the cocktail world. The daiquiri was overly alcoholic and under-limed. These people desperately need a bar program with  knowledgeable bartender designing their drinks. There are ten different bars/restaurants in Lawrenceville that make more thoughtful drinks.  All that being said, we'll be back. The server (wish I had asked her name) was wonderful. This has the potential of being a top-notch restaurant/bar. They just need to upgrade their bar standards.",

    "text": "I really wanted, and still do, to love this place.  I scouted it during renovation and had such high hopes.  The reality has been quite disappointing.  First - Lawrenceville is obviously the hipster spot, so you know what vibe you're going to get, but this place takes it to a new level.  In fact, 'trying too hard' is a pretty good description of the staff.  It's as if they're more focused on looking and acting the part than serving the customers?  I've been in countless times now, and never once could I say I received good service, most of the time you feel like you're annoying them.  And whatever you do, don't stop here in the morning to grab a 'quick' cup of coffee.  Prepare to watch a barista exhibition that will surely make you late for work.  Second - the food is just 'meh.'  Some decent things on the menu for sure, but in no way do I recommend this as a must eat restaurant.  Grab a beer,...maybe a bite...but there are so many better meals for the dollar right down the street.  Third - the tvs - consistent with my first point above, instead of playing sports, they will show you old black and white silent films, or in the back bar area they'll show you a lava lamp styled color screen.  I came in here one night to grab a beer and watch the rest of the game, and the resident hipster scoffed at my idea that they might actually, you know, show something on the screen that someone wants to watch.  But sure, cater to all of the people coming in that say 'could I see what 1920s B-movies you have?'  It's Pittsburgh, stop trying so hard.  Put a game on.    Fourth - the patio.  What a beautiful patio.  What a drastically underwhelming vibe for such a beautiful patio.  I understand having a dinner crowd and seating for that, but this place is aching to have more of a nightlife scene around the fireplace (which they don't light) or the fountain.  Either choose fine dining with great food and accompanying ambiance, or choose fun atmosphere and casual drinking.  They are squarely in the middle with no direction.  Finally - they do have decent beer on tap and actually figured out to make coffee drinks with alcohol.  Credit where credit is due.",

I walked through the front doors and had to walk past the bar to get to the host stand? Bizarre but okay. I get there and  ask for a table for two outside. The host replies \"What are you planning to have?\" WHAT? I DON'T KNOW! I've never been here before, haven't seen the menu. I respond, not sure. Apps and/or a meal. He then tells me \"Well, if you want to sit outside, you have to order an entree or you'll have a $25/person minimum\" so I ask to see the menu. There are at max 10 entree options varying from appx $12-25, however none of these options are a salad? I then said \"Do you not have a salad option as an entree?\" and was told that if I wanted a salad that would be considered a starter and I would then be charged a $25/person minimum. I understand that a business doesn't want someone coming in and ordering an iced tea and taking up their table during their busy hours however, I seriously can't sit outside and have a salad when you only have 4 tables full on a Sunday? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I was wiling to be a paying customer. I was going to order a salad at whatever price tag was associated with it. I was maybe even going to get an appetizer and/or a drink. My friend was also going to order some food as well. What was so uncool is that I didn't even have an opportunity to sit down and look at a menu to decide what I wanted. I had to make that decision while I was standing at the host stand. Did I want to order a $10 salad and be charged $25? Did I want to not eat healthy and get an entree instead to avoid the $25 minimum? Did I want to order a salad and an app to meet the minimum? All while there was no wait for a table and the outdoor section wasn't even 1/3 full.   I will not return to the Abbey on Butler no matter how cool your outdoor section may look or how good I hear your food is. Your protocols and the way your treat your customers is unacceptable and I'll take my business elsewhere.",

We noticed the adorable patio and decided to stop in.  The atmosphere here is great. Beautiful interiors with a great patio outside including a beautiful fountain.   Brunch menu offered good options... Omelets, sandwiches, entrees (sausage biscuits & gravy), salads, breakfast burger ect.  Both of us were torn between the Monte Cristo & Chicken & Waffle sandwich. We decided to order each and share. I also ordered a mimosa while bobby went with a glass a Moscato.  The Monte Cristo is served on French toast and  has 'dippy' egg, ham, cheddar & provolone inside with a raspberry sauce on top. While the sandwich was ok, it lacked flavor and honestly the raspberry sauce ruined it for me. It would probably benefit with the sauce on the side.  The chicken & waffle sandwich is just how its decribed... Fried chicken, bacon(!), melted cheddar, spicy maple mayo sandwiched between a waffle. The flavors meshed well together.. It was phenomenal!  All brunch sandwiches are served with pasta salad which was also delish (you Can substitute a different side for an upcharge)  Overall the food, ambiance, service & adorable patio nake it well worthy of 5 stars. Cant wait to stop in for dinner.",

Yet another place to order that:)   And if you tell them that they have plenty of empty seats with only an hour left on the night, explain to them you get food/coffee there a lot and just want to be sat and prefer not to wait at the busy bar and carry your own food to their minimal lounge section, they'll tell you and I quote \"since you come here a lot, you should know the rules!\" Lol!

There was even some extra coffee that the barista gave in an extra cup because it didn't all fit in the mug. They sell pastries here too. (They sell a coffee + kahlua creme brulee. Will have to try that next time!)  Nice vibes here, great for getting work and/or studying done. Free wifi. It is quite spacious with a mix of tables and comfy couches. Not many outlets from what I saw, so come with a charged laptop or get the seats near the outlets. It was pretty chilly in the room to the left from their AC right above us, but I guess that made me more productive in a way.. It's not too loud or too quiet here, but around 5:00 it started to get a little loud because of happy hour starting. I'd return to try out their restaurant/bar.",

A cozy place by a fireplace for coffee, a couple bars, and dining areas abound.  Exterior:  Outdoor seating on the patio is available.  On this particular Saturday, there happened to be an art show and music outside as part of their offering.  Food/Service:  Dined here with a friend for lunch.  We both landed on the same option -- pulled pork sandwich that came with a pasta salad.  Excellent choice.  Advertised as coming with apricot BBQ sauce, provolone, and charred corn salsa, it was quite satisfying, as was the pasta salad.  The were both full of flavor.  We didn't have any problem getting  a table at prime lunch time on this Saturday and service was prompt and friendly.  Price:  Ok by me.  The pulled pork sandwich and pasta salad was tagged at 9 dollars.  Can't complain about that for lunch and portions were perfect.  Yes,  I'll be back.  Guess that's a wrap.",

    "text": "Its almost as if they take pride in being pretentious A-wipes here. Now I've been here a number of times and I've never had a problem with the food; but the host with the bowtie... he's a lot to handle and the main reason I won't be returning. I'm not even sure why people continue to return to this establishment when previous reviews have addressed these same issues. Service is part of the dining experience and you guys can't provide any decency. A real disgrace to Lawrenceville, if we're being honest.   Now back to the host, not only is he an arrogant poorly dressed a-hole, he is also incapable of understanding any wants or needs of a party wishing to be seated. He is unable to comprehend anything though it seems, along with the management-esqe woman backing up his stupidity. God forbid you ask for an umbrella table on the patio at 2:30 on a very slow Saturday (where there are plenty of open umbrella tables & your just coming for a beer and appetizer). You will be blasted with numerous reasons why you shouldn't get an umbrella. They enjoy trying to make you feel stupid for such a request, though they are the ones with moron written across their foreheads.   Within 20 minutes i overheard him disrespect two other parties, one (an older man) who just wanted to move over to an empty table outside (he was already seated out there). It went something like this:  Guy: Hey may i please move over to the table next to mine Host: no its not clean  Guy: it looks clean i really dont mind  Host: sir you can NOT sit there its not been cleaned off (almost having a hissy fit now) Guy: it looks clean to me why cant i just sit there  Host: i can sit you inside if thats what you want  Me: ???????  How about get ur lazy ass outside and wipe it off? If hes willing to sit at a table that isnt wiped off, why cant he? Power hungry douchebag that just wants to feel an ounce of power for the day just had to say no.   I was a hostess at a restaurant in the upper east side of Manhattan for 2 years, a place filled with pretentious high class new yorkers and i would NEVER treat a human the way he chooses to. But im also not that stupid, and respect my elders, especially.  Anyway, if you want to be treated with the least amount of respect possible... hit up the Abbey. If not, I strongly suggest putting your money elsewhere.",

Accompanied by his Princess of Pretentiousness, they made every excuse under the sun, as to why they couldn't seat us on the patio at a table with an umbrella, despite having two open tables on the patio with such availability. When I say they used every excuse under the sun, Princess Pretentious began describing to me how the Earth revolves around the sun and casts sunlight at different angles throughout the day. No shit. That's why I requested a table with an umbrella.   After conceding to be sat inside, in lieu of any further condescension, we immediately overheard two other parties being denied patio seating due to myriad of erroneous reasons, as well.   We ordered drinks and the edamame hummus, after assuredly being demonized by the host/hostess duo, to the kitchen staff.   The Abbey is a place where people with obscure piercings, tattoos and/or non existent sex lives go to work, because they believe they're superior and entitled to be complete dickweeds.   Avoid this graveyard of hipster managed garbage. Our waiter was aight tho.",

The hosts/hostesses aren't wearing uniforms and are unidentifiable in a crowd, especially when you are waiting for a table in another room and have no idea who to expect to call your name. The bussers didn't clean the coffee table in the coffee lounge until we asked them to do so. This was well before the Saturday night rush and dirty dishes were everywhere on the empty tables. The waitstaff seems very inexperienced and our waiter literally read the specials from his notebook like a robot. The menu is extremely limited and the food is extremely overpriced for the quality. Just putting Siracha on something doesn't increase its value or appeal. Two shrimp for $5? Mashed potatoes for $7?There are FAR superior places to eat in Lawrenceville. This place feels like Yinzers who are trying to be hip. Increase the menu options and train your waitstaff if you expect to maintain a competitive edge in this neighborhood.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to this restaurant, as the building is beautiful and the patio is just so appealing.  Sadly, that is where my positives end.  I had noticed the previous night (online) that the menu is limited.  It doesn't really match up with the ambiance and style of the restaurant.  Mostly, it's just sandwiches with a salad option and a few appetizers.  Dinner wasn't that much better.  I did see several items, however, that I thought I would be happy with.  Like \"Not your grandma's grilled cheese\" and a red potato small plate.  The waiter told me these are not served at lunch, but I just looked online again now and they are listed as luncheon items.  Someone needs to correct their website.   The sandwiches didn't really appeal to me, other than maybe the hamburgers.  I'm not a picky eater, either, but there was always something that I didn't like about a particular sandwich (like curry which isn't my thing).  There were some appetizers and we ordered the zucchini with tempura batter.  It was cut in thick wedges and breaded and was pretty good - the only thing I really liked.  I ended up ordering the pulled pork hoagie with apricot BBQ sauce which sounded yummy.  After a discussion with the waiter, I was supposed to get my BBQ sauce on the side which didn't happen.  Instead it was soaked into the bread and I couldn't even really taste it.  The pork was dry and overly spiced.  I ate about three bites of it.  The sandwiches had a side of either pasta salad or fries (or an upgrade for a side salad).  We chose the pasta salad.  The pasta salad was a macaroni salad that was very similar to that you would get at a  bad deli.   They should not be listing that as a pasta salad.  It should be listed as macaroni salad.  One of our party got the grilled romaine with asiago cheese on top (she had been having some stomach issues and thought that would be the easiest on her stomach).  I thought it was an odd dish for an entree.  Maybe it would work as an appetizer salad.  That was it - the lettuce sprinkled with cheese.  The third party got the eggplant sandwich which she did like.  Our service was mediocre at best.  In addition to the BBQ sauce mistake, one of our party asked for an ice tea refill which she didn't get until she asked again.  I was never asked about a refill and the waiter was scarce.  They were not busy.   I also asked for something cool to put on my sandwich as it was so spicy.  The waiter said he would bring some ranch dressing which I didn't get until I asked him again.  By that time I knew I didn't like the sandwich and nothing would help it.  There were no desserts that we knew of, but he never really asked and we were going to walk to a nearby bakery where we felt we'd get better desserts anyway.  The place is beautiful and maybe good to sit at the bar.  They really need to re-do their menu.  It has nothing on it that would entice me to come back no matter what the atmosphere.  I do like gourmet food, but I think their menu is just odd, not gourmet or special.   There is a parking lot which is a plus in this busy area.",

The side salads we ordered to have prior to our meal were fresh and the dressing was pleasant.  That's all I have to say that's positive about this place.  The service was slow (but oh wow, how quickly our server managed to pick up our check & take our money), our server never asked us how our food was, I had to ask 3 different people who brought food to our table or cleared plates for more water, the food was overpriced and I would deem it nothing better than \"edible,\" the environment was far too loud to carry on a conversation, and the interesting lighting choices are overpowered by the huge television behind the bar.  My server asked if I wanted to wrap up half of the leftover hummus (I ordered it as a main dish because I wasn't particularly hungry) and I said \"No thank you, it wasn't good,\" and the server replied: \"Oh, that's too bad.\"  I feel like any sort of follow-up question might've saved me from deciding to never patronize this place again.  Like: \"Oh, how was it not to your liking?\" or even-- because again, I ate only half of it-- asking a manager to give us some sort of discount or coupon for future use or something, anything to demonstrate any sort of actual interest in the customer's experience.  Maybe we caught them on a bad night or at a bad time, I don't know.  If that's the case, as a customer, that's not my problem.  I've had very few dining experiences that were as bad as this one, and I don't ever want to go to The Abbey again.",

Second, the dessert case inside was something different you and usually don't see that too many places.   My friend ordered edamame hummus with naan bread. It was sooo good! They gave you so much hummus and a lot of bread which is key. Some places give you so much dip and not enough bread, but the abbey delivered here. She also ordered the eggplant sandwich but she wasn't too wowed by it. She said it was pretty tasteless. I ordered the chicken and Gouda sandwich and it came with macaroni salad. I will say the macaroni noodles were on the hard side, but my sandwich was very juicy and flavorful! I would recommend this sandwich to everyone! Overall, my first experience at the abbey was a good one and I will return!",

Beer selection is pretty good - tends to gravitate more toward IPAs and ales but something for everyone.   Prices for beer are average (compared to other places) and for food, prices also range from average to a little pricier. I had the provolone burger (good) with the house pasta salad (a little too al dente).   What made this experience for me was the music. Funk soul Motown on a Sunday night. I don't know if that's the usual since it was my first time going but ... Perfect.",

I'm not sure if they intend to have a British-inspired pub menu from now on, or if it rotates, but if you go while they have fish and chips or bangers and mash, I've loved both the handful of times I've been here, and had leftovers of both (which held up well the next day, even!).  The place itself is gorgeous and was the perfect place to bring my out-of-town parents and in-laws for dinner and drinks. They take reservations and have a ton of space, indoor and out.",

The other food patrons were eating looked fabulous We will definitely come back to try other food. There was great outdoor seating and we were seated immediately. Overall, I would not get the burgers here again but will try other food. Three stars for the burgers.",

    "text": "I tried the Abbey for drinks with a friend last night, and overall it was a really positive experience. I walked in and the friendly host let me know that the bar area was self-seating and that we could order at the bar if we chose one of the nearby high top tables. I decided on that, and the ordering process was smooth overall. I was always able to quickly get the bartender's attention for drink refills, and when I ordered some fries someone brought them right to the table. If you opt to be seated in the dining room, that comes with full table service.   The bar area itself got a bit noisy due to some rather raucous middle-aged patrons (I pray for that much energy once I'm their age!) so in the future I'll probably seek out the couches in the quieter lounge space on the other side of the wall. That was my only quibble however, and with how large the building appears to be I'm sure there are plenty of places to camp out with drinks and relax. I can't extensively comment on the food, but I may increase this to a 5-star review if it turns out to taste as great as it looked and smelled. One final note: The draft list was wonderful! There were lots of excellent choices and flights were only $8, which will keep me coming back for sure.",

A little sweet, great bourbon flavor comes through with a little of the citrus peel to enhance it.   Dinner, opted for a burger, and ordered the house made vegetarian patty with smoked cherry tomatoes, garlic aioli, frisee and Asiago. It's really one of the best House made, meatless patties I've ever had. Perfect bun and a side pasta salad. Excellent!   Coffee/dessert. We got up from the bar and went to the coffee house and enjoyed a raspberry thumbprint and Latte. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the nice evening. A beautiful fountain in the center is very relaxing and makes for a focal point for diners. The thumbprint was vegan and raw, made with dates, cashews and a dab of (house made?) raspberry preserves, friend of Joe had a  Blondie, she said was chewy, caramelly and rich.   I must put The Abbey on my regular rotation, perhaps stop some Sunday for Brunch. Kitchen closes at 10pm. Two parking lots, if they're filled there's street parking.",

    "text": "I hosted a going away happy hour at the Abbey last Thurs. for a group of my friends.  I chose the Abbey as the location because it encompasses a bar, a restaurant, and a coffee bar, and therefore is capable of satisfying a variety of tastes.  Additionally, it is quite large and has a lot of seating, including a pleasant-looking outdoor seating area, so I figured it could easily accommodate my group regardless of how many people ended up showing up.  Because the Abbey doesn't accept reservations, I arrived at the beginning of my event with a couple of guests and explained the situation to them.  The hostess told me that they normally wait for the entire group to show, but because my guests would be filing in and out over the course of two hours, she had us hang out at the bar while she prepared a table for us.  The table that we ended up at was between the bar and the foyer, and we didn't have consistent waitservice during our visit, but it did allow guests to come and go easily, which was nice.  For my drink, I ordered a prosecco, which was $1 off for happy hour ($7).  It was exactly what i expected--nothing too out of the ordinary, just a basic dry wine-like alcoholic beverage.  As a snack, I ordered the Yukon gold smashed potatoes ($7), which were miniature potato cakes topped with cheese and a garnish of aromatic green herbs.  They were rather bland to the point that I requested salt and pepper to impart some flavor to them.  Like the beverage, they weren't bad, but were nothing too special.  My other guests ordered a variety of drinks and food, including beer, cider, and cocktails as well as burgers and other small plates.  I can't comment on them because I didn't try them, but my guests didn't complain but didn't rave, either.  Based on my experience, I'd say that the Abbey is an A-OK spot to host a happy hour or other informal gathering.  The service was sporadic and the food was okay, but the setting was nice and offered something for everyone.  At the time of our visit, we were unable to take advantage of the outdoor seating because of rainy weather, but it looked like it'd be nice if weather permits.  The Abbey offers a welcome alternative to the many loud bars on Butler St. such as Industry, so be sure to check it out with your group.  3.5 stars.",

It has pepperoni in it, which I didn't eat, but my husband said it was good if you like that kind of thing. My husband got the bourbon peanut butter and jelly burger, and said it was ok.. nothing special but he liked it. Our friend got the chicken dinner and I had a couple of bites and it was amazing.   Our server was friendly and patient and I really liked him. The craft beers were in the $5 range which is very affordable, but my wine was $8 a glass with a very small pour. I should have gotten the bottle. Oh well.   The only reason this place does not have 5 stars is the way the host treated us. There were three of us and we wanted to sit on the patio. She said well we only allow guests to eat on the patio who are doing dinner. Ok b..... we are going to eat dinner. Who said we weren't? She really tried to push us to eat anywhere else, on a Monday, when they were dead. It was really insulting and she was ignorant. It got better though.",

I'm the type to withhold criticism favoring to give situations the benefit of the doubt, but when you've  been to an establishment 6-7 times (mostly during non busy hours) & have staff look you in the eye and just keep walking; staff silently move past you and nearly bump into you without so much as a acknowledgement of your presence; bartenders/wait staff neglecting to take your order or give you the check until you flag them down plus the condescending attitude of host/hostesses, it's official:  The Abbey does not make you feel welcomed.",

You open the giant front door to a chic interior of beautiful woodwork, wooden ceilings, and exposed brick. It has a warm and welcoming ambiance coupled with a killer staff - you won't want to leave! We sat at the bar and ordered their prosecco - on tap! It's really great quality; I even dared to have a second glass! We also ordered the Pub Curry Fries, which are a large serving of meaty fries doused in a deliciously amazing curry and cheese sauce, then topped with melted cheese, all served in a hot cast-iron tray. It's honestly hard to stop eating them, and we were headed elsewhere for dinner!  I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, so when I come to The Abbey it's always a real treat. I wholeheartedly recommend this amazing bar and restaurant!",

Something that was kind of strange was the music choice. They were playing popular hits but it didn't seem to match the look and feel of the resturant, it was kind of disrupting the mood. I think they could really benefit from playing more dinner appropriate music during dinner.",

I loved the atmosphere, and I could come here for dinner, to do some reading, or to hang out with friends, making it very dynamic. I was also really impressed with the food for the most part. They have some really cool coffee based drinks that were excellent. In addition, I enjoyed the lamb fries a lot (and they didn't skimp on the meat). the only thing I wasn't ecstatic with was the mahi mahi (I think? It was a fish fillet) with saffron risotto. The saffron didn't really come through for me and the fish was a little bland. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't order it again. I can't wait to come back and try something new!",

The manager on duty over the phone \"Nick\" was extremely rude and act as if we were doing them a favor to dine at their establishment. After being told we could not add one more to our reservation we were hesitant to still go. When arriving we soon found out we could of added multiple people to the reservation and it would not have been an issue. The manager on duty that day apologized and did buy the first round of drinks; which was appreciated. However, the food was OK, nothing to write home about and it was incredibly hot in the room they set us up in. A very disappointing experience and won't be back again. Way too many options around the city with way better customer service.",

We got the lamb fries, bruschetta plate, and stuffed pretzel. The plates were large and enough to share with our group of 11. The lamb fries were my favorite of the appetizers. The fries were still crispy even though they were covered in lamb meat and cheese. The dish also had a good flavor combination. Where I was disappointed in my visit here was my entree. I ordered the Abbey Burger and it was very over cooked. It was practically burnt, to the point that I couldn't taste the bacon, garlic aoli, or tomato. I ordered it medium, so I was disappointed I couldn't taste anything but the burnt flavor. The pasta salad that came on the side was very good though. Covered in plenty of cheese and sauce. It was fresh and refreshing from my heavy and overdone burger.",

Although we didn't sit there, the outdoor seating looked cozy and there was a front room (front left) that had a nice vibe. So that's the good part.   Beer selection was tolerable but not fantastic.   The food was pretty OK, just pretty OK. Bar food, nothing ventured, nothing lost. Slightly overcooked here and there, but nothing you wouldn't expect.    Service likewise was tolerable - a bit of faux pleasantness and slight inattentiveness, but  given the sparse turnout in the bar area (where we ate), not surprising I guess.   What was surprising was the strange management person and her arbitrary rules about which tables were reserved. APPARENTLY, the entire back bar area is reserved, except for literally at the bar. The front bar, well, NOT like that, anything goes there. We were literally and unceremoniously ejected from the back bar area, despite the helpful hostess telling us it was OK. Someone had a bad day/week/life.  Would I go back? Definitely for a drink, dining atmosphere, even in the forbidden back bar, leaves a lot to be desired. So does the customer service.",

    "text": "Fantastic! Friends & family were in town from LA last night. After meeting at Grapperia we could not decide where to head for food that would be substantial.   Lawrenceville has a lot of places to eat. It starts to feel like every place in the neighborhood feels the same & serve the same type of meal. After much debating, a friend suggested we retry this location. Boy, were they correct that this was the place to go!  We started our group with a table order of curry fries, zucchini, chicken dip, & hummus. I can't tell you how the hummus was because they use Edamame in the hummus which I have an allergy towards.  Which is disappointing for me. However, other seemed to like it but nowhere near as much as the Sriracha chicken dip. Which had just the perfect amount of heat and savory chicken when paired with the pita. Of course our group had to order a second order of the Chicken dip w pita.  It was DELICIOUS.  We enjoyed the zucchini served with aioli with its fat, freshly breaded spears however the Curry Cheese Fries were borderline addictive in comparison. I didn't anticipate the fries to be as amazing as they were. To me they just don't sound amazing when ordering. When presented. Oh. My. Gawd. Are they delicious!!!  The French fries are seasoned ever so slightly with a curry. Not to heavily but just enough to pair perfectly with the Welsh Cheddar they're smothered on top.  Like I mentioned, I didn't expect to like this but I couldn't believe I LOVED these fries.   I love where The Abbey is headed. The bar of course was slammed while we were there. Strangely the restaurant area was quieter than I expected.  One thing I find disappointing about The Abbey is that as a restaurant smack dab within a multigenerational neighborhood, they make no provisions to accommodate families in their cafe or dining room. The lack of a high chair speaks volumes about the type of neighbor they plan to be. And that's a bit disappointing. Especially for a multi space venue like the Abbey that serve as a coffee shop & restaurant; and not just another bar.",

The building is an old funeral home that they converted into a bar/restaurant/coffee shop and the space is massive. Renovations turned out beautifully and have created a warm, tasteful and comfortable ambiance, you definitely wouldn't know it was once a funeral home. There are at least two separate bars that I found, which helps bring the spaces together. Super happy to live so close and looking forward to coming here often.  I haven't had a chance to eat at The Abbey, but my friends say the food is delicious, and the coffee, too. My experience was at the bar where they had knowledgeable and friendly staff, a very wide selection of craft beers (most of them local, even better) and a pleasant/fun/yuppie crowd. We grabbed our drinks and wandered around, taking it all in. The lounge with the fireplace is perfect for chatting, and I can't wait to spend the summer in their gorgeous courtyard.",

    "text": "The team behind the Abbey has done an amazing job renovating this old funeral home into a beautiful restaurant full of intimate nooks where you and your friends can gather for a beer, coffee, or dinner. They also have the best patio in Lawrenceville, perfect for summer nights.   While the bar has a broad selections of beers and cocktails the food menu is strange and lacking in options. The menu is weighted heavy towards appetizers and small plates while leaving your entre selections limited to 2 burgers or 3 heavy/creamy pastas. I couldn't tell if they are going for a tapas style situation here or what the reason is for such a limited menu. I'd love to see another sandwich option or two and something like a chicken/pork chop/fish entre, especially during the summer months...I'm not looking for buttery pasta when its 80+ outside.   I'll definitely be back and hopefully they expand the menu and take advantage of this beautiful space.",

The patio and decor of the restaurant were nice and inviting, and a lot of people of all different ages seemed to be going in. However, I think our decision to sit at/in the bar area rather than the patio was where we went wrong.  We sat at a hightop table in the bar area, and were eventually given menus. We were somewhat sternly instructed that if/when we wanted anything we had to request and pick up from the bar. We understood this may just have been policy, and ultimately both the bartender and barback would come out fairly often from behind the bar to ask if we needed anything. Service was just a bit inconsistent, but our drinks were fine.",

The appetizer the chicken dip tasted like canned devilwood chicken with sirachia sauce. Very, very limited menu, I had burger my wife had Mac and cheese. Both horrible! Burgers I have had a red robin were 1000% better than the frozen over cooked thing that I had. The Mac and cheese was well not good at all. After we left we stopped for something to eat.

    "text": "TL; DR - Atmosphere is wonderful. Coffee and drinks are great. Food is meh, with some serious misses, service is horrendous.   Details - I am not a particularly picky person, but the service at the Abbey was apalling. The person who greeted us was rude. After a wait, and a weird attitude, we asked if they served food here or just drinks. She then asked us \"Are you here for lunch or brunch?\", it was our first time there and it was about 1 pm so we said \"Lunch\". To which she replied, \"Sorry we only serve brunch on the weekend\". Why the attitude and the question then!   Other issues with service, the wait staff was kind of bad at their job. The plates smelled of old food and the dishes still had food stuck on them even though they had clearly been in the dishwasher, and no one gave us any instructions regarding the buffet (e.g. Where is the buffet table? Do we leave our plates when going for a second round or use the same plates?). Pet peeve which bothered me but might not bother other people: wait staff would respond to questions with \"Huh?\" instead of \"I didn't catch that\" or \"Could you repeat that?\" or just a simple, \"Sorry?\". Also if we had a question or wanted someone to get us the check and they needed to consult another staff person or something, they would yell at each other from across the room, instead of just going and talking to one another.  They were out of much of the food, a lot of it didn't taste good at all although the french toast was it's redeeming quality.   The coffee? Amazing. Some of the best coffee we have had in Pittsburgh. Also a really good hot chocolate. The vibe was really great and fun and the decor is phenomenal.   Bring people to the coffee bar. You will get the good vibes, the service is much better and the drinks are worth it. I, however, am never bringing anyone to the actual restaurant.",

But the service is the thing that's going to keep me from going back. I've waited on the crowded patio for the only server to take my order. I've stood at an empty bar waiting for one of the bartenders to take my drink order.   But last night took the cake as I had a bartender sneer at me as I ordered and had him throw my card back at me after I'd asked to open a tab. Like, huh? And my reward? A mediocre, watered down cocktail.  That'll be my last trip to The Abbey until they get the front of the house in order (and give that bartender a lesson in, you know, bartending). The drinks are too expensive and too meh to deal with the poor service when there are so many other options available. Honestly, if it weren't for the patio I wouldn't have given them a second, and third, and fourth, etc., try.",

There is 1) the huge bar room with TVs and great tap list, then 2) the coffee shop with comfy couches and a badass fireplace, then 3) there is the huge outdoor patio with fountain and another badass fireplace, and then 4) last, but certainly not least, there is the dining room with tables and booths and another full bar.   Each of the four venues is intimately sequestered from the other, so you can be completely absorbed in the atmosphere of where you are (i.e. when you are in the coffee shop, you don't feel like your at a bar). The result, however, is a little confusing when you first arrive because most people are used to restaurants being one thing and one thing only. With the Abbey, it feels like a maze of entertainment that changes around every corner. However, once you get the tour, it's easier to wrap your mind around than you think.   I have never been too impressed with the food or drinks. I love a good cocktail and mine was so sour that I couldn't finish it. Seems like an issue with the bartender more than the menu. Hopefully, once they get their groove going, we see an improvement in the food and drinks. I am optimistic they will figure it out.",

    "text": "Great place and great food! Dined with a group of workers for lunch. Nice place for groups. Large selection of craft beers and the food was memorable. All of us enjoyed the same entree: chicken gouda sandwich with fries, slaw or vegetable side. It recommended by the waitress and it was a great choice. The sandwich was flavorful and had a delicious spread on it. The coffee bar was a surprise. We split a cookie among the six of us. It was by far one of the best chocolate chip cookies that I have eaten. Beautiful mysterious decor which I later understood the mysterious because it used to be a funeral parlor. The space is full of decorative surprises including an old organ, door with a wine cork handle, large wooden doors and a patio that makes you feel at home. Nice fountain and brick columns. It's perfect on a nice day.",

They use Commonhouse Coffee (located in Squirrel Hill) for their espresso base, so I knew what to expect.",

The buffet included your typical french toast, eggs, bacon, steak, pastries, etc. It reminded me of bad cruise food. I was completely underwhelmed. I am not sure how their brunch is going to survive with so many other delicious options nearby.   I might come back here for a beverage but  I will not be coming here to eat again.",

The restaurant has a classy casual vibe with a nice big bar area. We opted to sit in the outdoor patio area since it was a nice day. Their brunch menu has all the brunch essentials, but as a vegetarian, the only options I had (and liked) were the vegetable omelette and the biscuits & gravy (the gravy is made from veggie sausage). I went for the vegetable omelette which comes with their breakfast potatoes. Unfortunately they don't offer egg whites which was disappointing. The food was definitely not seasoned enough (or at all). It was decent for an eggs and potatoes dish but nothing wow'd me.   There is a small private lot to the right of the restaurant which I'm sure fills up very quickly. This is one of the few places in Lawrenceville that actually have a parking lot.   Overall, it was a 3 star experience. The atmosphere is great for a Sunday brunch date, but the food isn't anything I'd write home about.",

I ordered the lamb burger, my brother got the chicken and waffles which he loved and my mom had the regular breakfast meal with eggs and pancakes and kielbasa. My lamb burger was good. My moms pancakes weren't cooked like completely raw but they immediately brought out new ones and I will say the new ones were very very good. Like really good pancakes. I struggle with the prices though. My lamb burger was $16 I think and a side salad Instead of the pasta salad was an extra 3 dollars. I also ordered a side of 2 biscuits that cost $6. $23 brunch for a normal amount of food is pretty crazy.   Stopped at the cafe on the way out for a coffee to go and they were super confused and making wrong coffees and my latte was pretty average",

Well, if nothing else, it makes for a good story to tell your friends. We are always up for something interesting and new so we decided to make our way to The Abbey on Butler Street.   We got there very early on a Sunday for dinner after the brunch crowd had left so the entire time we were eating we were the only ones in the dining room. The servers were still getting all the silverware and everything ready for dinner service rush.  The two of us decided on the lamb shank and the steak frites entrees. My shank was very meaty and so tender it fell right off the bone. The spaetzle was a nice addition, you don't see that on very many menus. My husband's steak frites was just basic, nothing interesting or spectacular to note of that dish.  Probably one of the highlights of the evening was the dessert, the malva cake. It looked like a very generic type of cake but had a wonderful flavor. It had been brushed with a delicious apricot glaze, and the crunch of the crystalized sugar added just the perfect texture to the cake. Served with a dollop of whipped cream on the side. A light, but filling ending to our meal.   No military discount offered here.",

I love trying different places versions of eggs benedict.  Honestly - because of my love of poached eggs.   While it wasn't called anything near an eggs benedict - because honestly - it wasn't.  I wanted to try to the Welsh Rarebit with a side of bacon.    The Welsh Rarebit looked unique - and scrumptious.  Especially with that poached egg.  Well....it was more like a hard boiled egg.  While it was done in the form of a poached egg - that egg yolk had no run to it.  It was hard.  I was so disappointed.  I said something to the waiter and he told me that was what poached eggs were supposed to be.  (Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong - but they are supposed to have a bit of yolk run...right?! - or have i been eating poached eggs wrong everywhere else?)  I did ask for a side of bacon.  I was grateful that it wasn't \"soggy\" bacon.  But burnt bacon was not what I was anticipating.  It was dark, burnt bacon.  Not just well done - it was WELL done to burnt.  Overall I was disappointed.  I may be willing to try the Abbey for dinner sometime - but I've certainly given it enough chances on brunch.",

The humus and pita appetizer was big enough for the whole table. My Makers Bourbon peanut butter and bacon burger tasted like it had sat for a while--the cheese could have been more melted--but it was otherwise unobjectionable. The more I ate into it, the more I tasted the bourbon in the peanut butter smeared on the bottom. The consensus was that the current pasta side salad is better than the old one, before the menu was changed. Come early or call to make a reservation if you want to eat outside in the courtyard under a bright red umbrella with the sound of the splashing fountain.  Minus one star for waiting 15 minutes to pay, after the server finally brought our checks.",

We have sat both inside and out, and I can say both are great options. In the summer, sitting outside was nice if you aren't in the direct sunlight. The patio has nice seating but it can be hard to be comfortable and still hear the person across from you. The sofas are oddly deep. The indoor bar seating is also great too and you can order food service here as well. Evenings tend to fill quickly so I suggest arriving a bit earlier than the late crowd to get optimal tables.  The drink service has always been great. Wide variety of beers on tap to select from along with a unique cocktail menu. I stuck with beers on my visits but friends raved about the cocktails.

I found it odd that the waiter never actually passed out our menus he just sat a pile of them on the table and then another staff came to take our orders and I said well I never got a menu and she said that they were on the table so I kind of felt dumb in asking -- this is the third time I have been here since it opened and I don't plan on returning unless my friends suggest going -- to me there are better choices in the area.",

I had researched the history of the restaurant and the decor inside so so cool and refreshing- unlike any other place in the area.  Used to be a funeral home. Spacious and welcoming at the same time.   I chose the lamb burger and fries - which was very good.   Members of my party ordered the fish and chips and could not stop raving about them.  We had the option of sitting inside or out.  We chose inside and loved it! The service was great and can't beat parking on the street right in front of the restaurant!!   I love Lawrenceville but sometimes parking can be an issue.. since The Abbey is down a bit from the cluster of restaurants.. parking is no doubt hassle free.   We cannot wait to visit again!",

It's got a very cool looking exterior of an older fancy building but the inside has a very woodsy and polished look. Beer selection is great - they've also got TVs by the bar for those who want to watch games!   Coffee shop: So cozy and comforting! I love meeting up with friends here for chatting or a pre-going out coffee. My only (small) quip is that  most times here, I received my coffee in a to go cup when I've been asked and specified a coffee for here. Very much not a big deal, but just something I noticed after a few times. They serve great coffee and espresso, but also offer some alcoholic dessert coffee drinks that look great! They also have a lot of snacks and pastries to enjoy while there. A great overall experience for the most part!",

Our first choice was packed so our friends suggested The Abbey.  Their brunch buffet is remarkable, and the Bloody Mary bar is equally as impressive.  It was perfect.  Exactly what we needed.  I'm pretty confident the next time the call for brunch arises ... The Abbey will be first on our list for a re-visit.  Highly recommend.",

My wife and I had dinner at another establishment and decided to have drinks at The Abbey afterward, which we did. No sooner did we leave, my brother called to tell me he was at The Abbey, so we turned around to go back. We bought drinks inside, and went out to the patio and sat at the empty table beside my brother. A few minutes later the hostess came over and asked if we were eating- we said no, and she told us that the patio tables were reserved for customers who were eating, and if they got busy we would have to leave. Fine. The patio was mainly empty with a few parties trickling in. Not 10 minutes later she came back to tell us they needed the table and we had to leave. THERE WERE 11 EMPTY TABLES ON THE PATIO. I called and spoke to Mark the manager to tell him of my ridiculous experience and he merely reiterated what the hostess said, offering nothing to try to keep an irate customer from never coming back. By the way, I called my brother about 20 minutes later and he told me no one was ever seated at the table I was forced to leave. If I could give Mark and his hostess 0 stars I would. Ridiculous. There are plenty of places in Pittsburgh to have a relaxing drink.",

There is a coffee bar in the middle of the restaurant and it seems like an odd decision to make when there could be more tables added. We waited a good bit for a table and so this is probably me just being a spoiled diva, but I wouldn't have had to wait so long if there were tables in the center area. We had friends that had a table by the bar and they gave it to us when they left. The bartender came over to clear it off and was pretty rude about it. Luckily she was not our server and the server was very nice. I ordered the shepherd's pie and it was really good but really salty. I love overly salty things so I was fine with it. However, I can easily see someone being overpowered with the sodium levels. I also have to say...the fries on top? Quit it. There were way too many fries and not enough stew. I enjoyed the dish but there were definitely some areas that could be improved. I'm in no rush to come back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I really want to like The Abbey, and the truth is, I *do* like it. But I feel like it's in that in-between stage where it's trying to figure out how to be everything to everybody, and hasn't *quite* hit the target yet, and I have to be very specific about the timing of when I want to visit, and for what.  The Abbey is part coffeeshop, part bar, and part restaurant. It's in the space of a former funeral home, which this death positive girl really loves. There's a lovely outdoor patio with a fountain, for when the weather is nice. And the hallway is lined with lyrics to Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"   The coffeeshop area is very cute. During the day, it's a perfect coffeeshop atmosphere. But because there's very little in terms of walls between the coffeeshop section and the bar, as soon as the bar begins to get loud, the sound makes its way over to the coffeeshop area as well.  We've been in a number of times, several times with large groups. The bar service has always been awesome. They've done their best to accommodate the large groups, and if you're just a solo girl with a book who wants to read and sip wine, they are more than accommodating for that, too.  It's mostly the menu where I think things fall flat for me. The options seem a little all-over-the-place and kind of disjointed. On one visit, we had pork belly bruschetta. Sounds interesting, but it just was not meant to be, flavor-profile-wise. And the fried zucchini was just waaaaay too heavy to have as an appetizer. That's filling enough for your lunch, your dinner, and maybe part of breakfast the next morning.  One menu item that is not to miss, however, is the edamame hummus. It is just incredible. Flavorful, savory, and served with warm, soft naan bread.  In terms of booze: if you're a beer drinker, it seems they've really got you covered. I am not, but they have a good selection of wine, and although their tequila section is small, it's more than adequate. They also have a sizable cocktail menu that rotates seasonally.  I think The Abbey is still working out some of the kinks of being a triple-feature event. For example, when we went in for a sit-down dinner one night, we wanted dessert, but we had to cash out at the restaurant and leave our table, then order a pastry from the coffeeshop area. It was like having dinner and then going to a different space for dessert, and I wasn't really into that.  But, if you're gathering for a few drinks and some hummus, this is a good spot. It's a solid 3.5 stars, a place I will definitely return to, and a locale that I will absolutely update my review on as time goes by and they start to nail the concept.",

In any case, the bartender was friendly and attentive, the food was good and the atmosphere is great.  Very hip crowd.  We had bangers and mash and mussels.  They weren't the best I've had but were above average.  I would go here again just make sure you have a reservation so the pretty hostess doesn't have to think for herself.",

For a whopping $18 you are offered a buffet that includes gummy scrambled eggs, over seasoned potato wedges, greasy thin strips of bacon, sausage, old French toast, hockey puck biscuits, vegan gravy, and a made to order omelettes station (the only positive).  Their selection of brunch cocktails cost eight dollars each. Get ready to spend a lot of money for a very lackluster brunch.",

The little tables on the veranda are, well, little. A tad bigger would be better as two of us had to hold our coffee and pastry on our knee. Have been there before for coffee and for also for drinks at the bar and enjoyed ourselves.   It was interesting to see that there were two woman parked on the two large sofas. One had two sofas taken up with her laptop, purse, etc. another lady was sitting with her feet up.  Saw us looking for a place to sit but made no offer to move their stuff. We were fortunate that a patron invited us to sit in his little area.   We will be back though. Parking is a plus.",

The Abbey made a major misstep and opted to invest all of their tremendous budget on the renovation and clearly not into a menu.  The deep fried zucchini is like what teenager would make if gave them a deep fryer.  Their servers do not know what their bar or cafe has to offer, waiters seem to forget tables while the manger smoozes the tables with scripted questions rotating uncomfortably between tables. I didn't offer my honest opinion with my first brunch visit here. (I've had better complementary motel brunches.) I was shocked the brunch it served in hot plates and there is no menu just help yourself.  I hope they get it together.    The stars this place gets is for its top notch bar tenders and barista who should be running the show. The food is subpar and I've given this place three shotsLots of potential, not clear vision.   Good coffee, good bar. Food is a fail. Service is lacking.",

    "text": "I'm not sure I would ever go back here.   We had a table for 10 outside starting at around 9pm for a friends very lowkey birthday. Around 10pm 2 more friends showed up and we asked for 2 more chairs to fit around the table which had plenty of room. The manager Bob or Rob, came up to us and said he would not be giving us any more chairs and our friends were not welcome to stand around the table ether. At this point it was 10pm and 3 2top tables were next to us so our 2 friends sat down at one of those within 10min Bob was back and asked me if the gentleman and lady at that table were with us(instead of asking them directly), and that he needed that table back because he was on a wait. We begrudgingly gave the table back because we had a feeling he was not on a wait and lone behold he was lying not 1 person sat down at those tables the rest of the night.    Moral of this story is I understand Bob did not want us having 2 more people join our party but the way he went about it was just completely unnecessary. This is clearly a restaurant that was renovated by someone with money but no real restaurant experience. No one in FOH seemed to know what the hell they were doing and were some of the most unaccommodating people I have ever met. I tried this restaurant its first week and it was awful(the food and the service) and this just sealed for me I will never go back, I would rather spend my money at Wendy's down the street than The Abbey.",

I particularly enjoyed the courtyard on the restaurant side (I also learned there is a courtyard on the bar side!). It was a beautiful summer evening to sit outside and the courtyard and fountain outside made for a lovely atmosphere.  Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with the food. The menu was solid, with a lot of really neat cocktail options and a variety of food options for your dining needs. I went with a sandwich because I wasn't very hungry and it seemed like an easy and safe choice. It was completely adequate, but nothing I would return for. I will definitely be back to The Abbey in the future, but probably only for the cool coffee cocktails.",

    "text": "I want to preface this review with the fact that I was going to rate 3 stars, but upon clicking 3 stars Yelp prompted \"A-OK\" and 2 stars prompted \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and after reading the text, I align most with the meh. So, consider it somewhere between a 2 and a 3.  Let's start with atmosphere... the place itself is really cool. It's super dark inside but that's the vibe they are going for so I'm cool with it. The place is separated into a couple different areas/rooms which all seemed really similar-themed from my walkthrough. We had a reservation for 6 and had hoped to sit outside, but were told when we arrived that the patio was full. I was definitely a little annoyed since we made a reservation ahead of time and added in the comments the preference for outside, but oh well.  In terms of service... wow. I'm not sure where to begin. Honestly, the service was completely awful. Our waiter was polite but we saw him 3 times over the course of our 2 hour meal. We went most of the time with no water or drink refills which was displeasing. We had hoped to stay a bit and order more drinks and talk, but we weren't even given the opportunity. I didn't even get to order a first cocktail because our waiter left once and never came back.  The food was pretty average. I got a chicken sandwich and it was mostly bread. The chicken itself was pretty dry... ALSO of note: the menu says that the side included is pasta salad. IT IS NOT PASTA SALAD. The side dish is macaroni salad made with different noodles than macaroni. I'm not a fan of mayo so I figured the pasta salad would be delicious, but I was extremely disappointed to find macaroni salad on my plate. Wanted to share for those who also do not want mayo-covered pasta as your side dish. As far as food goes, the only thing I would recommend was the edamame hummus which was better than the rest of the food combined.   Overall, I would give it: Atmosphere: 4 stars (I liked it) Food: 2 stars (Meh; except for the hummus which was good) Service: 1 star (Non-existent)",

Don't be weirded out by the color (light green)! It is SO delicious and I love the Naan with it! You can get half naan and half vegetables too if you want. They definitely have healthier options too if you're looking for that.   I ordered the Samurai's Edge which literally tasted like a delicious matcha latte! This was from their tea cocktails. They also have coffee cocktails which are so yummy!   This place isn't just a night-time outing; they are also open in the day for coffee! I love the decor inside! There are board games and places to lounge both inside and outside! Can't wait to come back!",

I almost never give reviews under 4 stars, and have been working my way through the coffee shops around the city for the past few months, so keep this in mind for the rest of the review.   They have three drip coffees ready for the morning crowd: a light, medium, and bold brew. I asked about the flavor profiles of the coffees since the board went so far as listing the countries of origin for the beans. I've had enough experience ordering bold coffees that are just burnt tasting, so I wanted to make sure I wasn't ordering barbecued beans. I ended up ordering the medium roast and my friend got the bold. Neither cups were good. I managed to salvage mine with cream and sugar. Even then, the half and half tasted like it had been out for days. My friend's bold coffee tasted burnt without anything added, so I suggested following suit with cream and sugar. I took a sip after the additions, and it tasted like watered down sour milk. He didn't drink the rest of it. I also ordered the cinnamon mango muffin. It was dry but fine.",

They have the best fish and chips I have ever tried here. Fresh-tasting Alaskan cod with a crispy, tasty batter. It comes with seasoned fries which were fried perfectly, lightly crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside.  I had the Abbey burger, and it was also one of the best burgers I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, juicy without being too greasy. Comes with thick cut bacon that wasn't soft, but not too crispy either. It comes with pasta salad, which was also really good.  The only item that I have any complaints with were the wings. They were pretty over salted. Still edible, but way too much salt. They had a great flavor to them and I'm sure if they were less salty they'd also be the best wings I've ever had. They were perfectly cooked and juicy. They came garnished with blue cheese on top and ranch dressing on the side.",

There was a party happening in the front bar, but we got seated in the back bar/dining room area. To be honest, it was pretty dark. I liked the vibe, but I wouldn't say it's very kid friendly. Seems like it would a good location for a date night or catching up with friends.  To start, we ordered the pretzel bread and it was delicious. My dad ordered the fish and chips and my mom ordered a burger, and I ordered plain Mac & cheese. Overall, the food was good. I might order something differently next time.

I ordered a 3rd cocktail, the lavender in fashion and this one finally did me in.  I had the punch I was I was looking for but that could have been the other two drinks ganging up on me as well.

Throughout the years they have gotten into a pretty seamless rhythm and I can honestly say I come here more frequently because of that. Even to the point of suggesting it as a go to place for family and friends visiting the area.  They have and outside area, coffee shop, restaurant seating, and two bar areas. Honestly, there is a space and a place for everyone. You pick where you want to be and just relax.  Their menu has also steadily has gotten better over time. I was here recently for brunch and their Nashville Hot Chicken was no joke. Thigh meat between a cornbread (I believe) waffle. Can you ask for anything better? It was delish.  I have even brought my younger nephews here and they found things to like on the menu and they are picky kids.   Come here, the employees are great and so is the food.",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW! We've heard great things about the Sunday brunch here but we never imagined it would be this amazing. Creative coffee cocktails make this cozy restaurant stand out from the crowd. As soon as you touch the first step, you're introduced to the staple of the Abbey, coffee beans. I mean the door handle is literally full of coffee beans!   The service was awesome, as we were seated promptly at a comfortable table with plenty of natural lighting. It's almost as if you can taste each individual ingredient used in every dish and drink. I highly recommend the cheddar bacon biscuits, veggie omelette or the pancake breakfast. The biscuits were so soft, they practically melt in your mouth. The omelette tasted as if the vegetables were hand picked from a garden right outside, I couldn't have asked for more.  I could probably go on and on forever about how perfect our experience was, but I feel like I still wouldn't be doing The Abbey any justice. Stop by for brunch or just stop by for a coffee and prepare to be stunned!",

The ceilings, chandeliers, fireplace, and overall feel just screamed good vibes.   The food was good. I had the Shrimp & Grits which were sweet & salty just like you want them. My dining partner in crime had the Nashville Hot which was bursting with flavor from the bacon fat oil that it's made in.   The real 5 star rating came from the service. Our waiter for Sunday Brunch gave me some of the best service I've had while dining out ever. Great experience from walking in to walking out. Nice, attentive, funny, great with suggestions, cool, and some other reasons I can't remember. I'm not sure how they recruit or how them employees are trained but other restaurants can learn from The Abbey.",

However, we recently welcomed a baby to our family, and I'm disappointed to discover that there aren't high chairs or boosters available. I had to balance my 10-month-old on a cement bench on the patio, braced up with my leg while I ate my meal, and with no way to let him feed himself.  Definitely disappointing and honestly pretty surprising that the restaurant won't keep a few child seats in the back to accommodate the occasional child.  From the website: We do not have high chairs or booster seats; however, as a family accessible establishment, parents are encouraged and welcomed to bring their own.  Parents with strollers are encouraged to use our gated patio entrance as there are no steps.",

We told the host we were there for brunch and he told us they stopped serving brunch in 13 minutes and was very hesitant to seat us.

(And Miller Lite for the not-so-adventurous beer drinker)   The atmosphere is what I was caught up in.  So the first thing that you need to do is just get over the fact that this is an old funeral home.  It is all in your head, because the atmosphere and decor do not ring \"funeral home\".  A little dark, a little hip.  There was some dreamy Lana del Rey tune playing in the back ground.   The coffee shop was packed with people on their Macbooks, and the bar had a small happy hour crowd.  I am definitely going to stop in for brunch soon.  (It starts Saturday April 16, 2016)  They open early and have breakfast on Saturdays.  Two of my things...   Oh and another one if my go-tos is corn.  I love any place that has grilled corn on the menu. (See Happy Valley Brewing Company review)",

I think this place opened less than a week ago, so service is, as expected, working out a good flow. The front bar was very crowded as it was a Friday night and good news in lawrenceville travels fast  The building used to be a funeral home, and they kept the internal layout it seems. There are several big rooms and little nooks scattered throughout. The decor is lovely, very rustic, but I'm a little confused by the layout and concept. The front two rooms contain one full bar with bar tables and across the hallway is a \"coffee shop\" with espresso drinks and pastries. The back room is another full bar. Dining tables with full waiter service are scattered through the two bar rooms, which is a little strange. For one, both rooms are really loud because people are standing around drinking. Second, the waiting staff seemed to be running around somewhat frantic through the crowds because it's a lot of space to cover. You can order food at the bars, too, but there are very few bar tables/seats for you to eat at.  Overall, kind of confusing place with a lot going on at once... Again it was Friday night so maybe it was more crowded than usual with people there just for drinks? Regardless I wouldn't want to be competing with bar noise during my meal and it's too loud to be a coffee place. I think with time they'll better define spaces, improve efficiency, and layout. I think they're trying to do a lot at once, which is admirable, and the cocktails ($10) were good, but not perfected yet (try acacia if craft cocktails are your thing). I'll be back to try some food, probably on a weekday.",

Growing up in Lawrenceville, my Mom enjoyed reminiscing about how The Abbey was once a funeral home. She didn't think it was odd at all that she had been here as a little girl for funerals.

My family wanted to experience the restaurant for Easter brunch. From the moment we walked in, we felt unwelcome. From the hostess saying \"Oh, I meant to contact you. We do not have high chairs. It is up to you to make it work.\" ...wow, that'd be fine if you contacted me. Sure, my kid can sit on my lap. \"I'd like to order my omelet with egg whites only.\" \"Sorry, we don't have egg whites.\" (How do you make egg dishes then?) My husband wanted to order his lamb burger with an egg on top. \"Sorry, we have rules. No changes to the menu.\" Ok, so I ordered Steak and Eggs, a filet today. Ordered fried eggs...wow, hey there are those egg whites that I wanted with my omelet. My steak was tough, definitely not what I was expecting for the price or arrogance of this place.",

I've been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and every time I'm underwhelmed by the quality and uniqueness to the food. The atmosphere is what drives this score down, however, and the owners' blatant disregard for their customers. The music is too loud--completely distracting. People are trying to enjoy a peaceful place with coffee and food and you have music BLARING that you can't even hold a conversation. When I asked a staff member if they can turn it down, they say they're \"not allowed, that only the owners can control the music.\" So I asked for an owner. Who came over to tell me \"they like it this level because it's a bar.\" (It was 2:15pm on a weekday...who is jamming out?) So I walked over to the 'coffee house' area but the music was the exact same volume...it's all one big room with some dividers. I'll never be back. If you're thinking about checking it out there are so many better places on Butler St that don't have overpriced items and crappy atmospheres.",

Our server David was so lovely and accommodating - This certainly is not the best place in Lawrenceville for vegan options, but he was very careful to let me know what I could eat. We got the edamame hummus with veggies (the naan has butter), and I got the vegan burger over greens because the bun isn't vegan, which is labeled on their menu. Both were delicious! The dressing that came on the greens was fab and I didn't miss the carbs. David was also gracious about letting us sample wines because we are picky but we both found ones we liked. I have also come here just to drink at the bar and I love the ambiance and decor as well as the coffee cocktails. Anywhere that combines alcohol and caffeine is my kind of bar. Very cool place, always have a good time.",

We sat on the patio which was nice and chill - but we arrived before 11:00am.  Menu: Mostly geared toward the buffet with a few ala carte. Had the buffet (with omelet and pumpkin waffle option from the kitchen). Buffet had standard breakfast food, build you own fajita, brussel sprouts, perogies, etc. Partner enjoyed his chicken and waffles entree.  Nothing mind blowing but decent/satisfying for brunch. Not many vegan options. Cost $18.00 for brunch buffet.  Oh my coffee was pretty tasty!  Service: Pretty good. We were seated promptly, food arrived within 15-20 min and server was pleasant.   Overall, I would return for a casual Sunday brunch and probably try a happy hour since the place is so cute!",

They claimed that a number of their tables were set aside for reservations, but then seated other walk-ins, so I'm a bit suspicious on that count.   Don't think I'd be especially eager to go back, but I'm sure this patio will be full in the summer. To me, there's a big difference in service, food and atmosphere between a restaurant that serves alcohol and a bar that serves food - this is #2.",

The look and vibe of the place is unique, as well, with its are we a coffeehouse, or a restaurant, or both thing going on. The drinks menu looked great, with some novel combinations and the ones I saw were attractively presented. I didn't try one but I would if I returned. The menu options were fairly limited, but there may be a wider selection of choices at dinner.  The service isn't their area of strength...while my daughter and I weren't questioned about whether we wanted to order $25 worth of food (required to sit on the patio at late lunch time), the couple in front of us (in their mid 20s) were questioned. When I asked if the kitchen could make my fries without seasoning, the waitress was a little rude, telling me first that they didn't have seasoning, and then that they were unlikely to be willing to do so because the kitchen closed in 20 minutes (a break between lunch and dinner service). When I asked if they wouldn't be making fresh fries since both my daughter and I were both ordering (as well as the couple at a table next to us), the waitress seemed unsure. She never returned to confirm that the kitchen could do this, but when our lunch was served, the fries were fresh and unseasoned, as requested, and the burgers were cooked as we ordered them (medium rare).  On the whole, the Abbey was a little underwhelming for lunch, but it might work better as a happy hour and dinner. If I lived in Pgh I'd try it again for that.",

It's an old funeral home that they converted, and they did a really great job decorating on the inside. It has a wonderful \"old world\" feel.  I also love the idea of a combined coffee shop and bar - and talk about a good business idea! It makes them a great location for literally any occasion. Plus throw in free parking in Lawrenceville - talk about a well-planned idea.  The first time I came was just for drinks. I had wine, which was good, and just enjoyed the atmosphere. Today I came for lunch. They have a pretty good selection to choose from, but not many vegetarian options. I settled on zucchini noodles with curry and tofu. It was very good - flavorful and just something different. The tofu itself wasn't very good... But all the other veggies were flavorful, so I mostly ate around the tofu.  Overall, I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and will likely return. It's cold out now, but I also noticed they have a great outdoor seating space that would be great once the weather gets nicer.",

I don't dish out 1-star reviews without good reason but my last 3 experiences here have been terrible with the servers and bartenders. Tonight it took me nearly 40 minutes to get a check after being continuously ignored by the waitstaff. Part of the issue might be that one of the female bartenders drinks on the job and would rather socialize than do her job. I have spotted her doing shots with patrons on several occasions, not only is this absolutely illegal it just shows you how quickly things can get out of hand when you don't install the right culture in your establishment from the get-go. There is still plenty of potential and hope for this place but I won't be going back until they weed out the problems.",

We were seated by the back bar in the dining area, and it was not too crowded.  I got the beer battered chicken as my entree and it was not in the least bit greasy, super crisp, and the sriracha sauce was just hot enough to add heat and flavor but not overpower.  The lumpy mashed potatoes tasted like something your mom would make, that's a good thing.  A nice potato flavor, complemented with some salt and pepper, not crazy creative, but perfect offset to the heat of the sauce, and a generous portion. My friend got the fish and chips, same batter, and said the fries themselves were worth coming back for.  I only got an entree, she got wine and an entree and we got out of there under $50 with at 20% tip. Lots of people hanging out, I would love to try the coffeehouse part.  Will be back!",

There are so many things that can go wrong with fish and chips but the only thing I would change is getting the tartar sauce on the side to preserve the crispiness of the fish. We also ordered the zucchini for an appetizer and they had the same batter on it as the fish and it is just so good. My mom ordered the crab cakes and she wasn't too impressed with them. I had a bite of them and agreed. there was something off about them. Not that actual crab meat or freshness but there was some sort of spice that isn't typically used in crab cakes and it didn't work. This restaurant is beautiful. I'm talking amazing. It is worth going in to just check out the interior and lounge in the courtyard with some coffee. The waitress told us that they completely overhauled the menu, so maybe don't listen to a lot of the older reviews because apparently a lot has changed with the food. I heard they do an amazing brunch, so I'm gunna take my parents there next week. Will write another review after that visit.",

Super great and creative concept but terrible execution.  When we first walked in it was really confusing. There was a sign that said that there was no hostess which I found really odd considering that this place just opened a few weeks ago. We wandered around a bit trying to find a table. The majority of the tables were empty but really dirty. In the room to the left which I'm guessing is their cafe there was a man sleeping in one of the lounge chairs with a baseball cap over his head and his feet up on the table in the center of the chairs. We went back to the main room and saw that the brunch buffet was $18 and when we looked at the items in the chaffing dishes it was basically a dried out version of a hotel continental breakfast. I wouldn't have paid $5. We decided to settle for a quick drink before leaving in search of a better brunch option but as we approached the bar the bartender was taking a mouthful of pizza that was obviously not available on the brunch buffet. While I can't compliment her service, at least she had good enough taste to order a pizza in rather than eat her own product. She went straight from the pie to grab a bottle and start making a drink for a customer and that was all it took for us to leave. We will definitely not be returning if this is the type of service  that customers should expect on a regular basis which is a shame because the design gave it so much potential.",

The first time, we waited at the host station for about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged to have patio seating. Once acknowledged and seated, our server took an additional 10 plus minutes to show up and greet us at the table. Service was mediocre at best after that. Most of the party got the same or similar food orders, and the food was definitely good! So on a girls day that followed a couple months later, we returned. Service was worse. We arrived at 3:10. We were told we weren't allowed to be seated with the exception of bar seating bc the kitchen was closed between the lunch/dinner service. Okay. No problem. Until we read the menu saying kitchen closed between 3:30-4 to turn over service. I asked if we could be put down for a table for three outside and be seated at 4pm, when he the kitchen opened again. Was told no, come back in and get in line (even though by then we would have been there as paying customers for 50 minutes). We waited on the patio \"bar\" seating  area and had to walk in and out to order/pay for our drinks. Again, not a huge deal. Until at 3:45 we saw parties also sitting in the patio bar area being waited on and served food. A table of 5 or so near us was visibly frustrated as well. Both tables were told we were only allowed to sit outside for self serve bar drinks bc food wasn't available until 4. Another table received food orders. The party who was near us and also frustrated took their business else where. We decided to go in at 3:55 and get in line to see how we were treated and decide to stay or go based on that. The host came over at 3:58. The same one who knew we had been there waiting on a table for almost an hour...and AGAIN, asked us to wait until the servers were ready from their break and set up for dinner. At 3:58...when the kitchen \"opens\" at 4pm. Their policies on how the treat and restrict paying customers are absurd. The host wasn't even apologetic, empathetic, or reasonable. He basically acted like we were an inconvenience after they had already None and voided the policies they have in print on their own menus. We then left and spent hundreds of dollars at \"dive\" down the street. The Abbey will never receive business from me and my group of friends again and it's a shame bc the food is good. Terrible staff all around, particularly the hosts and wait staff.",

    "text": "Nice ambiance on the patio, cool decor on the inside, nice looking coffee shop area. We went for brunch today for Father's Day. Mediocre food, they had a pulled pork taco station for brunch with pulled pork out of a package, and not even good packaged pulled pork. The 'apple cinnamon' to order waffle was just a apple cinnamon box mix. No apples, no cinnamon. No eggs at the breakfast buffet, you could order an omelette if you wanted though. The \"pierogies\" were canned biscuit dough with, well something, inside. Hostess was rude and gave us attitude for wanting to sit in a certain area outside (we had the first reservation of the day and there was not one table seated outside at this point). Only gave it two stars because our server was nice, not a good server; but you could tell she was trying, and the atmosphere was pleasant inside and out. I won't go back, too many great brunch spots in the city, but I hope they take their menu and choices more seriously. I mean steamed Brussels sprouts with no seasoning at all.. and no eggs at a breakfast buffet? Cmon Abbey, you can do better.",

    "text": "OK I'm back to three stars, and it's really for the super-friendly baristas and nice coffee selection. I'm still frustrated with the general lack of customer service (outside of the coffee bar), lack of veg/vegan menu options, and the lack of consistency in offerings (one day, nice veggie wrap offered only to never be seen again).   The one thing I CAN count on is a strong cup of iced coffee (with non-dairy cream/milk options!) and a stellar Thai Iced Tea that I think my husband could sustain himself on that alone.  I've had cocktails at the bar a number of times, and they are good if a bit pricey. The Abbey does boast a nice draft beer list, but in Lawrenceville, that's the norm not the exception.  The atmosphere is amazing, and the outdoor space rivals any other 'burgh patio as one of the city's best. But inconsistent service as well as food offerings and lack of non-meat & potato options keeps me to mainly enjoying only the coffee bar.",

I had the burger, which was excellent, but my friend had the bacon mac n cheese and it was so rich we couldn't get through more than a few bites.  Our server was very helpful and recommended this avocado mousse appetizer which we loved, but it was served with fried pita bread.    The table next to mine ordered fish and chips and it looked so good there's a 100% chance I'll be back for it.

Both were awesome and the portions great for sharing.   Hubby and I also both ordered entrees. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but I'm glad we got to try so much. Hubby got the steak and said it was delicious, I got the Mac and cheese with fried chicken. All perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful. We literally had no room and ended up taking a lot home.

Fair enough, but before that happened, she ran off to do something else, then sat another party, and then sat us. We sat there for 10 minutes waiting for our server. When no one showed up, we took it as a sign and left. The manager was on the phone apologizing to someone while we were waiting for our table, so it looks like they have pervasive issues. It doesn't matter how the food is if you can't serve it promptly and politely. Or even get a server to a table to offer water within 10 minutes.",

The lattes are HUGE and only $3.50! Each one has cute latte art on top that looks like a fern frond. And the sweets are dense and decadent. Try the squishy apricot loaf, it's super moist and sticky. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to get work done, and also enough space for a small group to have a semiprivate meeting place.   The Abbey is easily accessible by bike and bus, and there is plenty of free street parking and a small lot.",

Of course this was before I found out that the Abbey was previously a funeral home.  It still has a funeral home type layout, so incredibly roomy which is something most places in Lawrenceville lack.    We secured a spot at the bar within a few minutes of waiting, and attempted to order drinks.  I can't recall what I asked for but the bartender said, it's kicked.  Ok how about, it's kicked.  This was an ongoing theme of the night.  I can't recall what I ended up going with but by the end of the first drink that also had been kicked.  Feeling deterred from ordering another beer I went to the cocktail list.  At least that should be available.   I ordered a Butler Mule.  It was made well and I was satisfied.  The atmosphere is really beautiful, and as mentioned the space makes the Abbey really unique.  They have different sections, and an outdoor area that would probably be great in the warmer months.  We checked out their food menu just to see what they offer and were pretty interested in coming back for some food.  They offer a brunch which normally excites me a lot, but this is buffet style.  Buffet style never excites me.  However the lunch menu looked great, so maybe some lunch on a Saturday with cocktails and I will make believe it is brunch.   Good stop for a drink, can't wait to try the food.",

Went here for my friend's going away bar crawl, and it was lovely! Had never been inside, and it's got such a European antique feel without looking too anachronistic or just too Victorian. Has a very dark-wood-library-esque ambience, and their coffee cocktails look...simply stunning.   I just had a mocha with...a shot of rum, I believe? I was quite picky, asking the bartender what kind of liquor would go with a mocha latte and he gave me that...or something. I remember pestering him for an exact amount, since I would be driving, but it was perfect. They have a separate coffee counter where you can order simply coffee or tea as well as the coffee cocktails, complete with roasters and grinders, tea dispensers and other required items.   I sipped from some of my friends' drinks and such, noting some pretty decent drink prices. We sat in one of the side lounges on some black leather couches, and watched a classic movie (some 60s flick, I believe).   Lovely experience, and I'm so excited to come back!",

    "text": "**Update** I had an afternoon meeting and returned to find a gmail from Mark, a manager asking if I would call regarding my earlier concern. Since it was after the time Mark would be there I spoke to Jamie who took the time to listen which is all I really wanted. My allergy is so severe it could have been bad. She so kindly offered to send me a gift card which is greatly appreciated. I look forward to going and trying something new, withOUT peppers  -----------------------------------  I ordered a late lunch consisting of the the edamame hummus and the ratatouille wrap via grubhub. The ratatouille said it was eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, feta, tomato, lettuce a coulis. Sounded amazing.  I get my delivery and open the box to find the wrap also had red peppers which I'm allergic to. It wasnt little diced up pieces but a lot of long strips of roasted red peppers. I was like ok, mistakes happen, I'll just call and let them know their menu is inaccurate and see if they will credit or make me one without peppers.  I called, explained what happened and was told that I would be transferred to a manager. The same gentleman came and said he confirmed there are in fact roasted peppers, said sorry ill have our menu updated and have a good day.   I guess the manager was too busy to hear my complaint. There also was no offer to credit or remake the food that I was not able to eat but spent $13.00 for. This wasnt even a case of where I thought the food was bad, I couldn't even try it because of my allergy. I understand mistakes happen but even the gesture of the manager taking my call would have been better than this brush off.",

After our order was taken, beers and appetizer came out really quickly, with entrees shortly after.   Nice draft beer list, cocktails looked great, too. Pretty meat-centric menu.  The beers! Both on draft:  -destihl syncopathic apricot sour ale ($7.50) - super tasty, bright, crisp, went really well with the sriracha chicken dip -shorts psychedelic catgrass IPA ($7) - earthy, smooth, boo liked it.   Food:  -sriracha chicken dip ($9.50)- two thumbs up, creamy, came out hot. Very flavorful and pleasantly spicy. Went well with the sour beer. -mac and cheese ($13)  - bland, but I  asked for no bacon, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. Generous portion, hot (temp-wise) and very cheesy -bangers and mash ($16) - my boo said it was nicely curried, hearty. He was excited to try lamb sausage. Flavorful.   Overall, a good experience. Happy they are open til 10 on Sunday nights! Will be back.   Also, I went to a work happy hour here a few months ago, and it was very well done. And they gave us to-go boxes at the end! And they have Thursday evening fun pairings/events like deviled eggs or a pie eating contest. And Weds night live music! A cool spot.",

This looks like a place with great potential, but they apparently don't honor their posted hours. That's unacceptable. I can understand when (once in a very blue moon) that systems might be down, that they might close earlier (go to paper, like the old days, instead of shoveling the cost into customers). If it seems fairy frequent that you'll close before 2am, then: better to just post hours that feature an earlier closing time that people can rely on. We don't go there to provide them with revenue and get out according to their convenience. We follow what's posted/advertised and make plans on that basis. We can't plan around a place that doesn't know it's closing hours. Will try it in a month, on a random weeknight, and will test the closing hours, net of last call, etc. (which should also be at a consistent time). If they don't want to change the current ethic, then we part ways, no problem (but this review will remain accurate).",

It's not just a one note spot - If you're looking for a bite, want to grab some drinks or stop for a coffee or tea this place has it. Their coffee and tea options are plenty and they even have boozy options as well, plus specialty ingredients like lavender and much more. The menu here is pretty diverse with just about anything you could want. I definitely come here for the bar more than anything.. they have interesting cocktails as well as beer/ipa/cider flights. They always have cool events happening like open mic nights but my personal favorite is drag brunch bingo. The outside area is great in the spring and summer, perfect for lounging and enjoying your coffee or cocktails. I definitely suggest this place to anyone and will be back.",

    "text": "One of the things I was thrilled about when I found this place is that there are two parking areas. One is very small to the right of the building but if that lot is full you  turn left down the alley and you will find a slightly larger one.  When I entered I realized that this place was once a funeral home hence that would explain the parking. In the front is a coffee bar with goodies and a very relaxing fireplace area along with a patio. In the very front is a study area if you wish to use their internet. They also have outdoor seating as well.  I stopped here for lunch so I was seated in the back. I noticed two, maybe three bar areas for later on in the day. They have a limited selection for lunch so I decided to opt for the hamburger and side salad. The waitress who attended me told me that if I didn't care for the sauce it came with she would put it on the side and bring me regular condiments. FYI-I was told that WiFi is bad in the back area and it is hard to get connected   While I was waiting for my lunch I visited the coffee bar. I was amazed at the size of coffee they serve you for a reasonable price. They told me to stop over here for  dessert since they make their own fresh daily. This is a challenge for me since La Gourmandine is located just a couple of doors down from here. However, I told them I would stop over.  It did not take very long for me to get my food. My hamburger came as I had ordered well done and the salad was very good. There is nothing really special about the burger outside of the fact I enjoyed it.  They have a very limited lunch selection so there's not much to choose from. You are served water with a bottle and cork on it unless you want a beverage or brew.  After I ate, I went over to the coffee bar and boy they were spot on about that coffee! So good!  I asked about their dessert offerings. They said their recommendation was the seasalt lemon tart. The also had what was called a malva loaf which is an African style dessert. They also had a huge brownie big enough for two people to eat. These are just a few of their offerings.  I settled for the malva loaf to take home with me and refrigerate it. They told me it was thick and filling and believe me when I dug into it they were True to their word! i really enjoyed this dessert so I'm saving some till tomorrow to finish it.  The atmosphere is more like Halloween than a former funeral home. Yet I was pleased with my visit. Again I feel that they should add more to their lunch offerings. The folks I was talking to at the next table told me they didn't know this place served lunch. As a final note if you order a sandwich you get a choice of either pork rinds, french fries. or a miniature version of their tossed salad.",

They have a ceiling light that was made from a window from a historical building, and It looks great in the coffee shop area. We were lucky the weather was nice on that Sunday so we decide to sit outside. Their brunch menu looks looks amazing and we ended up picked fried chicken and waffle, the lamp and gravy, and the beet salad. We loved everything but I think my favorite dish was the lamb and gravy. The lamb sausage has a charcoal taste and to eat with the gravy, it was Perfectly delicious. I would definitely bring friends over for brunch maybe check out their lunch or dinner menu at some other days as well. Their coffee shop area looks very comfortable, unlike other coffee shops that you can only sit on hard chairs but they have couple leather chairs, leather couch, they look very comfortable. I can see myself sitting on those couch reading a book or just enjoy a cup of coffee here.",

We felt lucky to sit outside on the patio, where there is a picturesque fountain.  I was surprised at the marvelous options for vegetarians, they served a delicious veggie gravy and also a savory cardamom mango compote.   The price is $18, which seems a bit expensive. Coffee and juice are free, but specialty drinks are extra.   My main criticism is the orange juice that was a typical bar orange juice, I was expecting something fresh squeezed, or at the very least something not-from-concentrate.

When we explained our situation to management, promised we would be gone by 5:30pm, and mentioned that we are regular customers, they were completely indifferent and told us to go somewhere else.  Given the poor quality of the food at this place, there is absolutely no way their entire restaurant would be filled with dinner patrons at 5:30pm.    I am shocked this place is still in business.

My Dad hilariously overheard him telling a fellow employee how \"slammed\" he was... we all laughed at that for awhile.  I really like the interior. I love all the different ways Pittsburgh finds to re-purpose old buildings. Who would think to use an old funeral home for a bar/coffee house/restaurant? It works in this case. They even have an outdoor patio that looks like a super cute place for brunch or drinks with friends.",

Wow, walking back to our table I was surprised how big this place actually was! There was two bars from what I saw. We were told one was a \"coffee bar\" and they were now open until 2 a.m. They serve \"coffee cocktails\", the hostess said it is a treat that not everyone has caught onto yet but give it time and that place will be flooded until 2 a.m.  We were seated in the way back. Only one downfall, the two top tables were so close together. I felt one move I was going to bump into the person next to me and I also feel I have to refrain myself from certain things ... Like swearing... Never fun.  However, the server was nice and the food was delicious. Anywhere that serves tacos... Let alone pulled pork tacos... Is a good place to me! You only get two but they fill it up so much with meat you don't need more than two! The prices weren't too bad. I had the tacos and two beers for around $15.00. I left feeling satisfied and I definitely want to try again!  Recommend.",

With no Starbucks close by this will be a goto spot for sure. Coffee AC and s book oh baby. The patio was delightful.

The coffee is very good and I loved the malva I had for dessert. I took home some lemon bars and was very pleased with those, also. I want to thank the staff and management for handling our group of 13 ladies with much patience because we requested seating indoors and outdoors. What a beautiful patio. We had perfect weather for those of us who preferred to sit outdoors.  One of the ladies did not like what she order and was given a replacement choice, without hesitation.  Sometimes when something comes with a sauce on top, you may consider having it on the side...the sauce on the salmon was not to her liking.",

    "text": "This is a marvelous setting that is going to need a little bit of footwork to find its niche. The vision is there, but now some real choices should be made (the black-and-white movies is an excellent first step).   If I were them, I'd take a look at other spots that mix these things (Agora in Houston is my absolute favorite. That place burned to the ground and the demand was such that they were back up and running very quickly. Or, the beautiful coffee shops along the Pacific Coast in California; or the heavily romantic bookstore-bars of Savannah). A sprawling yet intimate place, cloaked with a sense of history, has enormous potential.  I'm going to make some polite suggestions only because I want to see this place thrive. The menu is all over the place. There are a hundred faceless bar/restaurant hybrids with yet another over-priced \"Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese.\" I don't want to pay 9 dollars for a grilled cheese that devours the beauty and simplicity inherent in the reassuring sandwich. Other dishes have similar problems.  I'd try to do something in keeping with the atmosphere: simpler food, but better sourced. Maybe even take a look at some traditional monastery cookbooks (those can be so great: there's a place in Maine run by Franciscan Friars. Simple, beautiful, inexpensive, and everything food is meant to be without being inaccessible). Cheeses, breads, soups, clotted cream and seasonal, local fruit. There are all sorts of farms near-by; it could be a great partnership. For heavier meals, ethnic Scandinavian, British, or Polish food? That would be in keeping with the vibe; plus, all the excellent Polish food in this city really seems to come from church basements. A place that did more than fried pierogis with a side of extra-fried fries would be spectacular.  The staff is nice but confused. Visibly confused, and that will turn people away before they even step inside. There should be meetings, training, and clear, articulated purpose. If the manager is doing too much, with bar, restaurant, and coffee, there needs to be a general supervisor, and they should be brisk and experienced.  Finally, a bit more of an identity. This place has made so many good first choices, but then kind of trails off. What about seizing the neighborhood library trend and lining the walls in one room with books? What about hanging local art, or seeing what you can gather from Sacred Heart Store (it is called The Abbey, after all). Instead of generic black-leather-and-metal decor, what about salvaging old velvet chairs and sofas? Wooden tables? They would go beautifully with the decor. Growing vines or roses to shield diners from Butler Street traffic? The fountain is beautiful; keep it going.  This is very presumptuous for a review. But I haven't found anything in Pittsburgh quite like this and it won me over. I think narrowing the focus and tightening the vision would be immensely beneficial, and I want you guys to do well. I'll keep visiting, with a very curious eye! Best of luck!",

    "text": "The story of a SIX DOLLARS and FIFTY CENTS bowl of soup (curry chicken) ! in the cafe, so ordered at the counter (not a sit down lunch), served cold, and served with insults, but no baguette or even crackers. Our dinner about a month ago, at The Abbey on Butler was underwhelming. The menu was VERY limited ( we did hear a comment about a kitchen problem that particular day), and the dining area's bar was VERY noisy. there is a bar at the entrance, and the folks at the dining area bar could easily have been accommodated there, making the dining area quiet enough to talk to our dinner companions and be heard. Yesterday, i went into the cafe area at around 3, wanting a sandwich or soup. My $6.50 bowl of soup was barely luke. More like room temperature. I ordered it at a counter, this was not table service for this price! I got up from my table, took it to the counter and the barista couldn't just zap it for a minute - she instead, took out a thermometer and proceeded to wait for the temp to register. While I waited, standing at the counter. And waited some more. She consulted with another staff member, and said that the soup was a few degrees below normal but that it would be fine for most people. I continued to wait at the counter until she decided to heat it a bit. SO, i'm spending a LOT of time standing at the counter, AND i'm being insulted that most people would accept a cold bowl of soup.  Soup was served in a rimless bowl which is the type that needs a saucer under it ESPECIALLY since it has to be carried by the customer and a bowl with no  saucer under it  can be hot and dangerous to carry.  No saucer.  But no heat, so no problem for carrying, other than possible spills.  Not a crumb of a cracker or roll served with it for that high price.  I did speak with a server, who was off the clock and intervened to try to make the situation better.   He also kindly helped me get onto their wifi, after the restaurant's server didn't come up in settings.   However, it went off line almost immediately and again their wifi server  did not come up in settings.   I SHOULD have asked for an owner or manager, but the situation had turned into such a fail that I just wanted it to be over with. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice ...... I won't be going back! and don't understand why anyone else would want to. (the soup was really good though and my margarita at dinner was one of the best i've ever had - and I\"m a Margarita Maven.)  oh - and the advertised parking lot? very small (very disproportionate to the size of the restaurant) and hard to maneuver into - of course most Lawrenceville restaurants have NO parking lot, but if anyone mentions that the parking lot is a selling point, it shouldn't be.",
