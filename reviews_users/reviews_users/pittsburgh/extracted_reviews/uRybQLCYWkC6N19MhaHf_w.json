    "text": "My first time there. The food was not as good as my hopes and previous reviews led me to expect.  Scallion pancakes with egg: good, but I like Rose Tea Cafe's scallion pancakes better. King mushrooms with salt & pepper: these were deep fried, I take it. I was hoping for something less oily, something lighter. But good. Pork intestine with spicy sauce: My first intestine dish. I went into it with an open mind, but came to the conclusion that I don't like this dish: the intestine, vegetables, and broth were ok, but the odor and taste of the dried blood turned me off. Maybe if I had been eating this since childhood I would have loved it, but trying it at age 59 didn't work for me.  I'm coming to suspect that Taiwanese food and oily Chinese food aren't my thing. I prefer Cantonese. If I return, I'll avoid the oily dishes.  The ambience and service were quite good. A little pricey.",

Rude waitress rushed us to order and at the end of the meal, demanded us to tip. In fact, the waitress stopped my friend and I as we were leaving and said we didn't leave a tip and demanded we needed to tip her. Not once did the waitress come and refill our drinks while all the other tables in the restaurant at the time got automatic refills without asking. We paid for the food without complaining because the food was good. However, we were not willing to tip for service because there was no service at all! Will not be coming back no matter how good the food is and don't ask for a tip when you didn't provide service.",

The very best spicy beef tendon and pig ears (I understand this may not be Pittsburgh native thing), simple dishes prepared extremely well and fresh every day.  Other items in the menu are just as savory and delicious, one being the fish filet in bean curd sauce, steamed dumpling bags and all the small dim sum-like dishes that are very hard to find in Pittsburgh.  I will make the 45 minute drive just to come for lunch or dinner (at least once a week) and have not gone to any other Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant since coming here.",

    "text": "I pass by this place every day from work and I figured I'd stop in and see how it compared to the other Taiwanese restaurants around. Walking in, the workers are very friendly! The restaurant is very open and its design is very modern. I love how comfortable it is. It's sort of reminiscent of Everyday Noodles with the backlit walls, but it's much smaller (hence the cafe feel).  On to the food. I ordered a black tea w/milk and boba, steamed pork dumplings, and pork noodle soup. The pork noodle soup was actually my mistake (I meant to order the beef noodle soup from the previous reviews because it looks ah-MAY-zing) because I mixed up the numbers. When I got my order, I personally didn't really care for the soup. It's more traditional, with a thick broth and vinegary after taste. It reminded me of pho but it definitely is a much heavier soup. I have a feeling if it's more your flavor then you will definitely love it. There was an issue with my order where the noodles got left out, but my waitress very quickly went and got a fresh order for me. Like I said before, the wait staff is very friendly and willing to help make your dining experience the best.  The dumplings were a bit of a let down. In comparison to Everyday noodles, Cafe 33's dumplings had more noodle than meat filling, and were harder to chew. To be fair, Everyday Noodles has been here much longer and has had time to find the right ratio, in addition to noodles kinda being their thing.  The black tea was very good! The only complaint I had with it was that the tapioca boba were on the harder side. I'm used to them being chewier like at Rose Tea cafe or Everyday Noodles. Still, I'm a firm believer that if the drink itself is good then it's solid in my book. There's nothing worse than the tea itself being watered down or flat.  Overall I think Cafe 33 is very pleasant. It's possible that their strong suit is not noodles/dumplings however, and may be more in the traditional soups. Only time and experience will tell where this restaurant will fall in comparison to the others in the area. And while I had a sort of 'meh' food experience this time, the staff and diversity of menu make Cafe 33 a good place to go to try something different, and I'm going to have to go back to see what else they have to offer.",

    "text": "I'm Taiwanese and I love this new addition to the Squirrel Hill area! I brought my other Taiwanese friend on my first visit and immediately it was like going back to Taiwan. The service was on point, and our server was so enthusiastic! We ordered all the things that are naturally most Taiwanese and generally not found in other restaurants nearby (gua bao, scallion pancake with beef, pork intestines hot pot, golden duck yolk pork) to judge the authenticity and quality of food. We were both so happy with everything, from authenticity of all the foods, to crispness of the scallion pancake with beef, the perfect ratio of duck yolk to meat, etc. The price point is comparative to the prices of all neighboring Asian restaurants like Rose Tea Cafe and Everyday Noodle, but the food is 10x better! I used to go to Everyday Noodle all the time before I noticed a decreasing quality of their noodles (I will give that I go during busy hours)... and was ready for a new Taiwanese restaurant around the area. I left with an extremely happy stomach and knowing I would be coming back.  Since my first time in September, I have come back on many occasions (practically every other week), bringing different friends each time and recommending my other friends to go try it out! I have tried so much on their menu now, and while I can attest that their other foods selection are terrific as well (zong zi aka glutinous sticky rice, beef noodle soup, and mapo tofu hot pot are really good options too), if it is your first time going, I would definitely recommend ordering the foods I got my first time. That's why you go to a Taiwanese restaurant as opposed to another, right?  One thing I do regretfully have to say is to steer clear of is their bubble teas (or boba if you're Taiwanese like me!) and their soup dumplings (xiao long bao) though. If you want quality bubble tea, I'd say still go to Fuku Tea and order their loose leaf options. If you want soup dumplings, I'd still pop in Everyday Noodle since they handmake theirs on the spot. For every other menu item though, I'd say give Cafe 33 a chance and you won't be disappointed! (Did I say to get gua bao yet?)",

But today going to squirrel hill was so worth it! I saw there was a super long line from outside but was seated quickly as a party of two. Also this place was pretty easy to get to by bus, riding any of the 61's down Forbes. Once we got there, I was comforted by how almost everyone was speaking Chinese (that's how you know the place is authentic). I got a staple dish, the beef stew soup, and my boyfriend got the duck yolk pork ribs. I was blown away by the flavor of the soup and drank the whole bowl! Also the portion size was huge for the pork ribs, had to get a second bowl of rice to finish the rest. You will definitely leave with a full stomach. I would say this place is on par with the Chinese food in manhattan that I'm used to, and they accept card which is of course way more convenient. I will definitely overcome my laziness and come back to squirrel hill again for this place!!",

Squirrel Hill has tons of Asian food options, but this one is definitely hiring kick in terms of quality and consistency. I've really never had a bad experience here. Some of the menu items are definitely more authentic than others, and if you're looking for Food court Chinese food this is not the place to get it. I love authentic Asian style food and Taiwanese bistro 33 certainly has it. During the summertime they have a fantastic little patio deck out front and the service is always extremely prompt and nice.",

    "text": "This place has lots of options which is really nice.   We got the soup dumplings as an appetizer. They were super fragile though and cost $9!! And they were mini. Probably wouldn't get again but they were pretty good.   For entrees, we got the dried sauteed chicken with hot pepper and the chef's special, chicken and salty fish with chives. The chicken was super good. The chef's special was also pretty good (although in my opinion the sauce makes it kind of hard to tell the difference between the chicken and fish) and it was covered in chives. My only real issue was I wished they gave more food because it's kinda pricey.   Service was okay...our waitress was actually kinda rude at the end. My boyfriend quickly added a tip pretty close to 15% (though it was a little below, he had just calculated if in his head) and the waitress saw it and circled the receipt and told him to give her 15%!! What?!! If he had seen that error he probably would've just fixed it since it had the amount for 15% on the bottom but I thought that was really rude of the waitress (especially when she wasn't very friendly in the first place). It was an honest mistake and I feel like she was rude in that situation.",

Fortunately, it was early so we didn't have to wait for a table. Keep in mind that The tables are small and actually pretty close to the next table.   We ordered the sweet and sour pork chops, soup noodles, beef or pork stomach, pork belly sandwich and a warm milk bubble tea. The food came out really quick! I really enjoyed the warm bubble tea and the sweet and sour pork chops which came with a small bowl of rice. It was amazing! I don't remember if it was pork or beef stomach but it was good. The dish was cold with a kick of spice.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes! I would definitely recommend this place!",

Most of the customers who dropped my the place were Asians, so that really speaks quite highly of Cafe 33 itself, too.  A group of us (6 people) stopped by for a late lunch on a weekday, and from what I heard, we were pretty lucky to arrive when they aren't so busy with lunch/dinner crowds (I heard the lines are typically out the door and you probably have to wait if you arrive during a normal lunch/dinner rush).  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and got our own rice to eat as well. Not sure of all the actual names of the dishes on the menu, but we got marinated extra firm tofu (super yummy!), stinky tofu, xiao long bao, veggie with tribes, panfried shrimp omelette, watercress veggie, kang pao chicken and slice chicken with veggie!  And I'm happy to report that all the dishes were really good! To the fact that I mentioned to my SO that it was hard for me to believe that I was eating this in Pittsburgh!  Overall, the prices were reasonable at around $8-12 pre dish. We paid around $105 including tax and gratuity...not bad at all..and we were full! Service was great, too. Highly recommended especially if you have been longing for authentic Taiwanese food in the area.",

The restaurant isn't too loud and we could have a good conversation there. The service was very responsive and friendly, the food was very quick to come out of the kitchen. We like the food and I particularly like the flavors of the dishes and the portion sizes are generous. You will definitely not leave this restaurant hungry. I do have to say that most of their dishes are oily and greasy. That's typical to this type of cuisine and therefore I accept it for what it is but at the same time that's why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.",

We ordered scallion pan cake with egg and spicy pepper chicken. Scallion pancake was not great when compared to the one you would get at green pepper. However, this is an appetizer which is way cheaper than the regular pancake I get at green pepper restaurant. I don't think I will order this item again.  Spicy chicken was tasty. I am glad to see that they didnot add overwhelming amount of dry peppers. I had the spicy chicken at other places where I felt like I was searching for chicken in a pile of dry red peppers. The chicken is soft and tasty. I will order this dish again when I go the next time.   Their menu offers large selection of food which is great. Will definitely go back to this place!",

    "text": "My new favorite Chinese restaurant!  Just opened a month or so ago from what I hear; I have already dropped by four times in the past week to sample different entrees and overall, an easy approval.  Recipe execution:  Excellent.  The only Asian place I have been to that does not use too much soy sauce or salt in their dishes.  Perfect seasoned flavor.  Service:  I love to see smiles on the servers' faces as they happily take orders.  Dining room:  Tasteful interior and kept clean despite heavy foot traffic and business in and out.  Here are comments and recommendations:  Salt n Pepper Shrimp. Crispy and delicious.  Could use more shrimps though.  Salt n Pepper Squid. Flavor is there but needs to have a crispy coating and somehow doesn't.  Sweet n Sour pork chops: Sweet and not overpowering.  Meat candy goes well with rice.  Intestines in Spicy Sauce Hot Pot:  Best version I have had since moving from Seattle.  Contains Pork Blood cubes also but it could use more.  These hot pot tend to be salty but it is not that way here!  Definitely would get this again.  Short Ribs in Black Pepper.  The coating and beef is very hot to be careful not to burn the roof of your mouth eating.  Slightly fatty and scrumptious.  Love this one however it doesn't have the outer layer crunch that Rose Tea Cafe's version has.  Scallion pancake w egg.  I guess I was expecting a green onion pancake that was crispy or pan fried.  Take a gander at my photo and you will see.  I would not order next time.  Golden Duck Yolk Shrimp:  Interesting shrimp..  it is coated with egg yolk then with the flour then fried.  The result is a creamy yolk flavored shrimp.  Our table had mixed feelings about this one.  The better half did not like the yolk portion while I thought that the first couple were good then decided it was not my cup 'o tea.  Seasonal greens:  Ong Choy w garlic most definitely on par.  Taiwanese Cabbage was alright but ong choy or watercress is preferred. Always ask for extra garlic.  Chicken Basil Casserole:  Good but my preference is the bone in variety with skin.  Flavor is there and dark meat is tender.  Beef Chow Fun:  I would not recommend if seeking the more traditional wider, thicker and charred version.  Not much beef.  Overall, probably the better Chinese restaurant in Squirrel Hill. We now know what to order as our favorites.  ;)",

It's better now, so to those who've \"crossed out\" this place, reconsider going back!  I went back recently and got some takeout as I was seriously craving pork buns. The pork bun ($7) was good, but could've had a little more cilantro or peanuts though. I may prefer everyday noodles for buns.   I also got pig ear and tripe. The tripe was deliciouuuuus. A little on the pricier side ($8 for that tiny plastic pack), but they make it in house and it tastes like home. The pig ear was great too. It was sliced to a perfect thinness.   I know, its hard to judge service via takeout... but I do anyway. The lady in front was really sweet and accommodating. She helped me pick out the side dishes/appetizers too, so for a service standpoint - 10/10.  tldr; foods improved, generally average to above average food, sweet staff, would go back",

    "text": "Since my family is Taiwanese, I was very excited to try this place after hearing about it. I really wanted to love this place, especially since they do have many traditional dishes on their menu, had great ratings, and were clearly very popular based on how packed it was when we went. Maybe I hyped myself up too much...  Went for dinner with a friend on a Friday night, so as expected, it was crowded with group of people waiting to get in. It was a 15 minute wait, not bad. From the moment we sat down, however, they were clearly trying to get us out as quickly as possible so they could get as many customers in as possible. The server came back to our table about 2 minutes after seating us to ask us if we were ready to order. We'd barely had time to read the pretty extensive menu, so we asked for a couple more minutes. Server was back in about 2 minutes like clockwork. So we just picked something fast.  Food comes out - friend got stir fried rice noodles. Nothing spectacular. I got the beef noodle soup, always the first thing I try at a \"Taiwanese\" place since it's my favorite popular native Taiwanese dish, but one that's difficult to get right. The broth makes or breaks this dish...unfortunately it was very bland. Even asked for extra heat, and it wasn't spicy at all.   The sticky rice appetizer was tasty, and the boba milk tea had good flavor and nice chewy tapioca balls, so there was that.  Anyways, maybe only 10 minutes into our food, my friend is eating a bit slowly and has put her utensils down. The server comes up and asks if she would like a box. My friend says \"yeah, eventually,\" and before she can say anymore, the server snatches away her plate.  She brings it back wrapped up, and also brings the check even though I am only halfway through my food and still quite actively eating.  We don't touch the check yet since I'm still eating. Server comes back a few minutes later, sees the check is untouched, picks it up and puts it beside my bowl on the other side to kindly remind me its there. Ok, fine...I'm not really enjoying my food at this point with someone so intent on getting us to be done and leave, so I get my food boxed up and pay so we can leave.  After my food is boxed up, I'm trying to finish my giant mug of bubble tea as quickly as possible without having to swallow boba balls whole. Another waitress comes over and asks \"are you waiting for something\"? I'm just trying to finish my drink, c'mon...literally sucking it down as quickly as possible without choking on tapioca.  I really don't care if the server is friendly or not...I'm there for the food and not smiles and small talk. I get it, weekend nights are busy and there's a wait line and you want to get as many customers in and out as possible. But being made to feel like a huge imposition from the moment we sat down, which made eating very unenjoyable, plus our food just being average, makes me hesitant to come back, even though I'd love to explore the menu more.",

The stinky tofu was better, but both the beef noodle soup and the jellyfish appetizer (which was more vegetables than jellyfish) were especially bland. The stir-fried rice cakes and short ribs are good. The soup dumplings were unbelievably small this time and had no soup in them, so you'd be better off going to Everyday Noodles. The portions were small for the prices and the hostess was extremely rude! We asked to switch tables because the light was out above ours and my mother has poor vision, and she became immediately annoyed with us even though they weren't busy. Our waitress was friendly, however.",

I didn't think I could have multiple favorite restaurants in the same street, let alone across the street from each other. I came early on a Saturday before it got too busy. My first attempt was last weekend, but I came at 8pm.   It is a small restaurant and delicious, so for obvious reasons it gets crowded really quickly. The decor was very cute. I was surprised how quickly the food came out since the place was so full, but there were a lot of waiters and waitresses running around.   Being vegetarian, I always have questions and my waitress was very familiar with the menu given that it has only be open for a little less than two months! First I had the marinated dried tofu, which to my surprise came out cold and almost instantly. To me it was very bizarre but also tasty! The sauce was not overpowering. I also ordered a vegetable spring roll for my appetizer but it came out after my first one. One of the best I have had! I was obsessed with the sauce but I couldn't quite tell what it was. It was spicy!   For my main dish I had the cantonese noodles. I was very happy with it because it was not too greasy and seemed to have the perfect amount of salt. Overall a great experience. I will come again and try other menu items soon!",

Service, timing for take out, take out packaging, cleanliness, location (free street parking is usually available off of Shady Ave or other side streets), and most importantly, their food.  Cafe 33 is definitely my *favorite* neighborhood takeout place. I have probably ordered take out from them at least 20 times and eaten at the actual restaurant on a dozen other occasions.   Their food is consistently good. I abandoned my old neighborhood take out in favor of Cafe 33s unchanging menu and service. My favorite entree is the dry sauteed string beans and it remains the same whether I order it in the restaurant or have it for take out. I've also had their rice cake entree and multiple different side dishes that were all equally delicious.   I have also not tried the hot pepper chicken, but have heard that it is worth getting if you eat chicken (I don't) and like food with a nice kick.",

I pointed at the picture on the menu and hoped for the best.     I looked around and noticed that we were the only Anglos in the restaurant.  Nobody was speaking English and I found the murmur soothing.  There were a couple of the staff sitting at the front table chatting and snapping fresh green beans, which gave me a warm, familiar, happy feeling.    The plate set in front of me contained some insanely good looking freaky food including a brown hard boiled egg.  I took a bite and it made me bop up and down in my seat it tasted so Good!  Apparently this is not normal behavior in this establishment and I caused a bit of a giggling episode amongst the other diners.  I wish I took a pic of my plate before I inhaled the contents, but alas, I did not.  I was not sitting there going \"nom nom nom nom\" the whole time but I wanted to.  I love this place but don't take my word for it, please check this place out for yourself.  I can not imagine that anything served here would be subpar!",

Packed with flavor, some crispy, some not, the shrimp were perfect. Normally they are left too crisp at other establishments. -duck yolk shrimp The highlight of the evening- crispy outside with a creamy inside. AMAZING. It is not on the menu.  -eggplant with garlic sauce very soft, flavorful, delicious!  Prices were relatively great, though some items were loads more expensive than others. However, the flavor is unmatched. I would definitely go here again when given the chance.",

I'm not sure if our waitress hooked us up, but there was no cork fee for our wine.

She kept saying she wanted to confirm the order to make sure we were getting what we wanted.    I know y'all have probably heard nightmares about stinky tofu, but it's always been one of my favorite parts of going back to Taiwan. The stinky tofu here is definitely milder than the ones you'll find on the streets of Taipei but still tastes good. It doesn't have that pungent smell you're probably imagining but still has that crisp outer later encasing soft, silky tofu. If you don't know what it tastes like, it tastes a bit sour but again, this was a very mild form of stinky tofu, probably to appeal to more western tastes.   We also tried a few other small plate/appetizers. We had the turnips cake which is usually found at Cantonese dim sum restaurants but these were slimmer portions fried on all sides. They weren't the same as the ones traditionally found at dim sum but a good, sharable appetizer. One of the disappointing appetizers were the steamed mini pork soup buns. The flavor was good but the skin on them seemed a little dry and they weren't bursting with soup. As you can see in the picture, they fall a little flat. Not the soup dumplings I was expecting.   One staple dish for Taiwanese kids is minced braised pork over rice and it's served with a tea-soaked hard boiled egg. This dish had plenty of rice but also a good amount of the actual meat and sauce as well so you're getting your moneys worth. Would definitely recommend this dish for everyone.   Ordered a few more dishes and enjoyed them but nothing spectacular. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone seeking authentic Taiwanese food for a reasonable price. All but the soup dumplings lived up to my expectations and we enjoyed the meal and service!",

And the craziest part, the speed at which everything comes out. Don't know how they do it!  THE BUBBLE TEA is pretty good! If you're craving some boba, definitely try their Green Milk Tea! It's my favorite one!  THE SERVICE is always so kind, thoughtful and efficient. I've gone plenty of times, and never once did I have a negative experience. They know how to treat customers with respect and warmth. They also definitely know their food as well!  THE INTERIOR is clean and definitely aesthetically pleasing! Plenty of seating and CLEAN RESTROOMS!  My only complaint? It tends to be busy but that only goes to show how great this place really is!

I really wanted to try the braised pork rice and found it to be pretty tasty. Be warned, only order the braised pork if you like fatty pork belly. The pork belly fell apart in my mouth and the fat went with the rice so well. It was served on a bed of bamboo shoots and alongside pickled cabbage. Lastly I also tried the pan fried noodles with chicken. The noodles were thin egg noodles pan fried with various vegetables and dull pieces of chicken. The sauce was quite plain. There was nothing remarkable about this dish.   Overall, there are select dishes here that are well done, so make sure you pick carefully!",

They don't take reservations but when we arrived at 8 PM on a Saturday, our party of four only had to wait a few minutes. Restaurant is pretty small on the inside, but in the warmer months they have lots of additional seating in their outside patio. They're also BYOB which is an added bonus! Our waitress was quick to greet us with water and wine glasses. No daily specials, but with the huge menu we already had our work cut out for us. Menu isn't very description at all, which made ordering a little hard since we were first timers, but, also just means we'll be back to try more soon. I continuously hear how amazing the Dried Sauteed Spicy Green Beans are and the Eggplant with garlic. For the table we shared the green beans, plus boyfriend got the boa bun. The green beans, WOW, SO incredibly delicious, absolutely bursting with flavor. Huge chunks of garlic and ginger throughout and they weren't too spicy at all, just the right amount of zing, and everyone at the table absolutely loved them. SO fabulous. The boa bun was pretty big and enjoyed by the table as well. I was trying to get recommendations out of our waitress but she kept guiding us to play it very safe. Said the stinky tofu was a little different and didn't want us to try (so sweet). My friends who frequent there later told me they've done the same for them time and time again, to err on the side of caution. They had a ton of veggie noodle entrees and a ton of veggie appetizers, so lots of options to pick from. After a few questions I ended up ordering the Lo Mein with vegetables + steamed tofu. It was good! Honestly kind of bland and I was sad by that. Needed to add chili paste to give it some more flavor. But, the noodles were SO delicious and all the veggies and tofu brought it together. It was really tasty. Big portion so I ended up leaving with leftovers. We had lots of people recommend the Chicken with basil in casserole and my boyfriend absolutely loved it! So that was a major hit. Already looking forward to my next time there. Quick service, affordable prices, and incredible food. Every seat in the house was full the entire time we were there, all the reason to come back and try more.",

We started off with the soup dumpling, which were delicious! Each dumpling had just the right amount of soup and were so flavorful. We then had the mala spicy chicken and shrimp and eggplant dish. The chicken was nice and crispy with a bit of spice. This dish was quite addictive. The shrimp was very good as well. Will definitely come back to try more items off the menu. The prices are very reasonable as well. Overall, a great place to grab some quality Taiwanese food!",

    "text": "Another bucket list restaurant of Pittsburgh checked off my list! I've always heard great things about Cafe 33, but I haven't had the time to eat here yet. However, my aunt's birthday was today, so she picked Cafe 33. Perfect.   When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was the cute decor. Traditional decorations hung on the ceilings, as well as a pretty beaded divider that leads back into the seating area. The people were very friendly as well as our server. She taught me how to correctly use chopsticks and made our party laugh.   The food was to die for. For appetizers, we ordered the beef tendon and fried stinky tofu. The beef tendon is excellent and is served cold. The stinky tofu was awesome and thankfully not too stinky. But that wouldn't have mattered to me anyways, I would have ate it. I love tofu! We also had the pork buns- they were great. For dinner, I had the pork intestine with Chinese hot peppers. The peppers had a bold flavor and the intestine was delicious. My family also ordered beef with eggplant, pan fried noodles with shrimp, chow mein, beef with Chinese hot pepper, and the stir-fried rice cakes. I really liked the stir-fried rice cakes- the rice cakes were like soft, chewy rice balls, kind of like gnocchi! Also, I had the red bean smoothie for a nice refreshing drink. The red bean is very sweet, but not overpowering. I was pleasantly surprised by it!   The service was super fast. Our appetizers came out within five minutes after ordering them and the dinner came out about two minutes later. They are mighty quick!   If you want truly authentic Taiwanese/Chinese food, Cafe 33 is the place for you. It's an amazing ethnic food experience and it's perfect for adventurous eaters. I loved it, it's probably my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I will be returning!!!!",

Even though we got hit by a storm halfway through our dinner, we opted to stay outside because it was so nice outside! The hosts were also personable and attentive. Despite a packed venue on a Sunday evening (AND while everyone scrambled to escape the pouring rain!), we never felt forgotten. Our food was memorable too. The szechuan chicken had a great balance of texture and spice, and the string beans were excellently prepared. I love that they were charred yet not excessively oily or overseasoned like at other Chinese food joints. The salt and pepper squid was perhaps the most remarkable plate, whose meat was delicately flavored and well complemented by the diced spices and veggies on top. I would have liked to seen more texture here, but overall these dishes were really well balanced. I look forward to visiting again and trying more of their menu!",

The restaurant is an okay size on the inside, but it could get very crowded. The first time I came here for dinner, it was crowded and we had to share a large round table with other guests. The most recent time I came was for lunch, and it was not crowded at all. The restaurant has outside seatings. On a nice Pittsburgh day, these seats are ideal.   I have had the soup dumplings, Singapore noodles and sauteed string beans here. The soup dumplings were delicious, and very comparable to those I have had in NYC Chinatown. The only thing I didn't like about them was the vinegar dipping sauce, but it didn't bother me too much as I just didn't dip my dumplings in there. The Singapore noodles were also delicious and had the perfect chewiness to them and came with generous portions. The sauteed string beans came with rice. Although this is generally a pretty basic dish, it tasted amazing. I loved that the string beans were cooked with ginger and red chilli pepper that gave the string beans some interest. I didn't know I could eat so much vegetable at once, but I finished the whole plate.   The waiters here were also nice and welcoming. Service is very fast.   The only thing I would wish here is that I wish they would put ice in their water and provide straws with water cups. I'm not a fan of room temperature water and no straws.   Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for some good Chinese food the Squirrels Hill area.",

The food is amazing and I haven't ate something I didn't like (maybe except the soup dumplings). There's a lot of variety with the menu but I would recommend the string beans (forgot the whole name but there's only one of this dish under the vegetable section), the stone pot chicken, pork with bamboo shoots, and the sweet and sour pork tips. The soup dumplings didn't have much soup which was disappointing so I would avoid ordering it. Some reviews say that their food is greasy but like idk where you would find taiwanese/chinese food that isn't.   Their drinks are also really good! They come in these large glass jars so they are so cute. Would recommend getting one if you eat here.   Another plus is that the restaurant is clean! The wait staff does their job well and I did not have a problem with service. My only disclaimer is that my boyfriend spoke fluent Mandarin which made ordering and interacting with them much easier. BUT they DO speak English. You just need to ask questions if you need clarification about any dishes.",

But I recently came for the second time for dinner on a Sunday and I was really satisfied. I don't have many experiences with authentic Chinese food so this might be one of the best I've had so far.   The menu is pretty extensive so do your research or come with people who are familiar with Chinese dishes so you get the best food experience here:) We ordered the mapo tofu, stir fry rice cakes with beef, and the mala spicy chicken. My favorite dish of the three was the mala spicy chicken. It's like deep fried breaded popcorn chicken with Chinese red peppers that added a kick of spice (not extremely spicy but just right).   The only issue I would say is that because Cafe 33 is such a popular restaurant, it can get crowded and loud. The space isn't as big for its need. This might be the reason why I didn't come as often in the past... just was never sure if there would be seating available. As for the service, our waitress and the other servers was super friendly and accommodating.   Can't wait to try out more dishes here!!",

Since the restaurant sign had gone up in July, we had been patiently waiting for it to open and thankfully they didn't disappoint. We regularly visit the other Taiwanese restaurant (Rose Tea Cafe) across the street. Hence, for the sake of comparison we tried the same main dishes (Kim Chi Stir Fried Chicken and Sauteed Pork intestine) here that we used to have at the other restaurant. They have an extensive selection of appetizers also. While the two main dishes were as good as Rose tea Cafe, but the Taiwan Style Pork buns (kind of like the Char siu buns minus the sweet n sour barbecue sauce) were definitely the best we ever had. The bun was soft and moist with ample portions of meat inside. The food was no doubt great but what urged us to write this review was their great customer service. They had messed up one of our main dish orders, but once we brought our complains to them they not only apologized earnestly for 50 times but also packed for us the dish that we wanted-completely free. We are definitely sold on their service and will be back again to try their entire repertoire of taiwanese dishes.",

It was indicative of the high quality of service we received throughout the meal. For entrees, we chose the Pan Fried Noodles with Chicken and the Kim Chi & Pork Hot Pot.

I am hoping that Cafe' 33 will stick to its guns in educating its customers on the fine art of vegetable cooking. Their vegetables are the trademark of excellence in Taiwanese cooking - Americans generally, (and Pittsburghers specifically), now have their best opportunity to see what expertly cooked vegetables look and taste like :).

And I had to go to the restroom to wash my hands. Third, I did not know why but the gentleman came just after we had been seated to ask us what to order. We said, just a moment. But the gentlemen came again and again every one or two minutes, asking us what to order, looking like he was urging us to order as quickly as possible. But we did need some time to read the menu and make a decision. Lastly, the waiters were not responsive. We wanted to add a bowl of rice. We raised our hands to call for somebody to help us. But we failed twice. In between, another gentlemen even passed through our table. At that time, two people were trying to cross the lane behind our table, and the congestion caused the gentlemen to stop by our table. We looked at each other and at that time I was raising my hand for service. Then he turned to look downward and avoid looking at me and my raising hand. But soon after, he looked up again as the lane has been cleared and he could move forward. Again, we looked at each other with my hand raising. But he had no response to me, but just left. This made me very confusing and disappointed. Finally, our third trial of raising hand made another young gentlemen come and finished our request. But, the experience at this restaurant made me a decision that I shall never come again.",

So make reservation if you can(I am not sure if they take the reservation) or come in early to avoid the wait! We quickly ordered the black pepper ribs, Taiwan style chow fen and the garlic fried chicken. Everything was on point and authentic. It feel like we were in Taiwan! Defiantly recommending it to friends! Also the place is not big, very cozy, I can see they are trying to fit as many people in as possible.

The beef is very tender and the beans are cooked perfectly. I also love the flavors of the sauces they use. Every time I come I try to order a different dish because everything looks so delicious.   The service is quick and efficient, and food comes out really quickly. The place is always busy when I visit, but I've never had any issue of having to wait long for a table. Will definitely continue coming back when in the area.",

I heard that the former Rose Tea Cafe chef moved to this restaurant. my favorite dishes are the FRIED CHICKEN CUTLET OVER RICE & the MUSTARD GREEN AND PORK NOODLE SOUP. the former is the standard go-to for me and many of my friends, and it never fails our expectations. however, the interior is not very spacious and feels very cramped (everyone is seated very closely), which make sense because they want to serve the most people they can. when the weather is nice, they open the front garage and have outdoor seating. hopefully they can expand since they almost always have a wait during busy hours.   tldr; food 5/5 interior 2.5/5 service 4/5",

We had their soup dumplings: delicious. Salt and pepper rib tips: perfectly fried and huge portion, seasoned really well. Chili fish in a stone hot pot: fish was so tender, portion was also huge, and was not really spicy at all. Their Chinese watercress was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The service was really nice and attentive. Our waiter made sure that we were taken care of the entire time. He was so nice!! The prices aren't too ridiculous for the amount of food you get. I really love this place and hope to stop by again sometime soon.",

I got the minced braised pork over rice, which was pretty good and quite cheap (around $7). A very solid meal for its price point. The mango milk tea with lychee jelly was also the perfect sweetness, with an adequate amount of mango flavor, and a generous portion of lychee jelly.   I would not recommend the noodle soups - they don't taste as good and have too much onion.  Service is good, and the location is well-kept.",

They didn't really seem to honor our reservation - our table was not ready until about 20min after the correct time, but some of our group arrived late so it ended up working out ok.  All of the food we had here was delicious! As someone who doesn't eat much meat, my favorite was probably the eggplant with basil. I also really liked the ma po tofu, which was just a little bit spicy, but definitely not too much. We also got a fish fillet that was amazing. The menu here is not very descriptive, so your best bet is to come with someone who is familiar with Taiwanese food  The service here was also quite fast. Despite the larger order, our food came out all at once about 20min  Overall, good spot for dinner. Vegetarian friendly and able to accommodate large groups",

Cafe 33 is a fan favorite amongst CMU students and my group of friends, for good reason. We know that we can always get good quality Chinese food here, and while it does get busy on weekends and such, we're always seated and served in a timely manner. The prices are also pretty fair.  If you come here (which I recommend you do), try and get their traditional Chinese dishes. I am impressed with the high quality of their vegetables, because it's hard to find places that make such great Chinese vegetable dishes. The Chinese watercress is a favorite of mine, despite the high seasonal pricing. The string beans with minced pork are also great. My personal favorite is the salt and pepper pork, which is crispy and flavorful.  I already come here very often, but I definitely will be coming here again.",

Cafe 33 gives you all the great non-spicy options in Chinese food there is, but where they really hit the mark is with their basil, garlic, pepper combination. It's a trademark taste that is just so savory and will seep and tingle your tongue with joy. I've tried several of their dishes with this flavor, and I've got to say the fish and chicken are two of my favorite.   For other menu favorites, I love their black pepper short rib...it's another one of their dishes with exciting flavors. And in addition, they fry their short rib a bit, which gives a bit of crunchy enjoyment.  Overall, the restaurant has lots of savory Chinese options, and consistently delivers quality items to your plate.",

The food seems to have gotten very greasy across all of the dishes, which I definitely did not think was the case before, as I really liked the fact that the food wasn't too heavy when I first came. Also, the servers don't seem to be as personable, and while they have always been known for a high turnover rate, it seems as if they just see you as another transaction. One time when I was eating with my girlfriend they squished us in a very crowded area between two tables when there were a lot of other open tables that would have been more spacious for us. They agreed to let us move upon asking which was good, but at the same time makes you feel a bit suss as the customer.",

Also, they were accommodating to a shellfish allergy, which was really nice. I'll be back!",

The broth and noodles were very tasty. I am really happy to have found a place that makes a good beef noodle soup and I will surely be back again for more. Also, their rice is great.",

The offerings here are pretty solid and they have a wide selection of Chinese/Taiwanese food to cater to all tastes. I especially like their Beef Noodle Soup. There's just a sweet spot to it, the soup itself isn't too salty/over-flavored, and the noodle consistency is just perfect for the soup itself. Scallion pancakes here are also pretty solid (egg or beef - I prefer the latter). Taiwanese Three Chunk Chicken here is alright, I prefer the one served at Rose Tea Cafe (the one in Squirrel Hill right around the corner) since it's not as salty. Bubble tea here is mediocre. Though the bubbles are okay, the flavor and consistency of the bubble tea just isn't there quite yet (I prefer either Banh Mi & Ti (!!) or Fuku). Would suggest that you come to try this place at least once.",

One man (who I think also works in the kitchen as he wears an apron and runs back and forth) who serves you is so warm and humble and friendly, he makes you want to come back. The Ma Po Tofu is bomb, and their stir fried seasonal Chinese vegetables are always delicious and garlicky, which I am super down with. They have an extensive menu, and the quality of food is definitely above most of the other Chinese restaurants in the Squirrel Hill area. It can feel like an overwhelming amount of options in this neighborhood, so just know that you cannot go wrong id you choose this place.  Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it can be very cramped inside, with tables pushed up very close to one another, and it gets REAL hot and sticky in the summer in there.  Enjoy!",

If you want the American-Style Asian food, at fast food prices, you only need to look down the street. I have now been three times, which is a lot of repeat for me. Can I name all the dishes? no, lol. I loved the Lotus wrapped sticky rice, the dumplings, one called \"Sha gahn Lau Stui???\".. I loved the mushroom dish I had, which beats my sister-in-laws, who has this legendary mushroom dish, and picks her own wild mushrooms from the woody hills by her farm. These guys must have good vendors, and they add love.  From what I can tell, is a specialized Chinese cuisine, from the island of Tiwan, lots of vegetarian dishes that my wife has loved, and mind you, it will take us a while to discover all the dishes... but I even dared their Tripe, (I think that is how stomach is spelled). It was more of a dare, since I haven't liked it in the past, but I really enjoyed it!  Clean bathrooms, a patio to sit at, classic features like a water fountain, and lots of space for a small reataurant.  I heard people compare it to Rose Tea Cafe, and I remember those guys vastly improving a few years ago, and as it turns out, it is this Cafe 33 chef that was the reason. I am happy he has his own place. You'll love the food, so worth the moderate price, and the staff is great.  I know the place is new, but I can tell it's going to be an East End Icon!",

But, I have to crow about it!  We enjoyed the vegetable and wonton soup which was enough for three people.  The vegetables were crispy, the wontons were very delicate and quite good, and the broth was perfect - not too salty and not watery.  The mini pork soup buns are really good.  They are not as good as Everyday Noodles, but they are not to be passed up - because they are quite tasty.  The pan fried dumplings were lightly fried and very delicate.  My husband had the beef over Chinese watercress - the greens were perfectly al dente, the beef was tender and very lean.  My daughter and I had the stir fried rice cakes with tofu and chicken.  The rice cakes were appropriately chewy and the veggies were fresh, crisp and delicious.  The sauce was bit oilier than I would have liked, but the taste was so good that I was able to finish the whole plate.    Cafe 33 has only been open since September!  To have things together this quickly is quite a feat.  I am looking forward to having this wonderful Taiwanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill for years to come.",

Sometimes, you can tell how authentic Asian places are by the rudeness of the servers/owners.  And it goes like this: the less they care about you, the more authentic the food is. If an old Asian man/lady laughs at you trying to eat/order, you're probably in for some really great and authentic food. So while I wasn't particularly pleased by the initial attitude when I walked in the door, the food quickly appeased me. I got stinky tofu, sauteed an choy/kong xin cai/hollow vegetable thing, the xiao long bao, and shrimp. The tofu was properly stinky, the sauteed was done properly, the xiao long bao all had soup inside, the shrimp were served with their heads well attached. Similar to some of the Taiwanese restaurants in Flushing! You should definitely try out this place if you're craving some authentic Taiwanese food.",

As far as food goes, this place might have the best lo mien I've had in my life. The steamed dumpling had a power flavor/aroma. I highly recommend this place to any craving Asian flavor.",

Prior to visiting, I had already done some research about the food scene, and this place came up. There isn't a great selection of East Asian restaurants, so I had to try it. The first time, I came with a large group of colleagues; the staff was nice and accommodated us all. My party and I shared a variety of dishes, and we were all enjoyed what we had. The second time I came by myself and ordered what I had enjoyed the most during my first visit, that being the pork soup dumplings and the special fried rice with chicken and shrimp. The food was fresh and very flavorful, and the texture was right. I recommend this place and look forward to coming back the next time I visit Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Cafe 33 is one of my favorite restaurants in Squirrel Hill! I have my go-to items on the menu and crave it pretty frequently. But as time passed, the glorified view of Cafe 33 began to fade.  The main thing I must note is the lack of seating. The space is very tight and if you come with a larger group (5+ people), you might gave to wait a while to sit. I hope they expand the restaurant soon!  If you don't know what to order, I highly suggest the fried chicken cutlet over rice! The fried chicken is so tasty and the sauce they use us somewhat sweet and garlicky - a flavor I tend to enjoy very much. It's cheap and enough food for 2 meals! If you're doing family style, I really like the fried rice cakes, duck yolk pork tips, turnip cakes, and garlic basil chicken in a stone pot. However, I have found that doing family style (ordering a couple of dishes for the whole table) can be sort of pricey compared to getting one over rice dish for yourself. And I'm not entirely sure that it's worth it because I am definitely more full from ordering one over rice dish for myself. Certain dishes are also too salty for my liking, but others seem to enjoy it nonetheless.  Their bubble tea isn't bad either. I've had the traditional black milk tea with tapioca and it hits the spot if you're craving something sweet! But don't set your expectations too high, and keep in mind that this isn't a place that specializes in boba.  I love that you can also call beforehand for a pickup order, or you can even get your food delivered through Postmates. Both great alternatives for days when it's super packed in there but you still want their food.",

I've been here multiple times and can safely conclude that the food here is consistently great. Dishes usually come fast after ordering. Service is decent but could be lacking when it's busy (which is common).  I recommend most of the staple Twainese dishes here, such as three cup chicken (basil & garlic), duck york pork rib tips, and minced braised pork over rice. The only dish I ordered here that I didn't like was the short ribs with eggplants in hot pot -- the short ribs were too heavy battered and deep fried in a bad way.  Cafe 33 is definitely one of the top choices for authentic Chinese in the Burgh.",

If not, they often ask you to add more tip before you leave. Additionally, I think sometimes they add the tip in for you instead of letting you write it down yourself. Overall, that's the only part I don't really like but I'd still come back for the food. It has pretty delicious food and I'd still recommend people to come try it.

We were lucky to come in with no wait for two on a Sunday morning around 12:30pm. The atmosphere is low key and staff are prompt to take your order.  APPETIZERS: - Scallion Pancake with Beef: This yummy breakfast treat was amazing and has been hard to find. It was not too salty and the texture of the pancake was just right and not overly greasy - Steamed Mini Soup Pork Buns: Amazing. Could have done with more meat, but loved the generous offering of soup inside and the skin was a good thickness.  ENTREES: - Taiwanese Style Noodle Soup: Loved the noodles for this dish; good chew, delicious flavor in the soup. Slightly on the peppery side, but a great dish overall with its mixed flavors of chicken, shrimp, and cabbage. - Chicken with Basil & Garlic in Stone Hot Pot: Chicken was a bit dry but nonetheless very flavorful; they captured the aroma of the fresh basil and other spices particularly well.  DRINKS: - Black Tea Milk w/ Tapioca: The milk tea was pretty good, but the tapioca was slightly underdone and not as chewy as one would expect  It is not easy to locate such a gem with dishes at this standard just anywhere; the bistro certainly has many offerings and delicious eats that is worthwhile to frequent. My only lament is that it is in an entirely different state from me.",

A lot of my friends absolutely love this place, especially for their fast service.  TURNIP CAKES($5): Surprisingly good. It has a crunchy outside with a yummy brown sauce drizzled. Good app. If not these, try their soup dumplings. STEAMED FISH (Seasonal): Whoa I've never had this before but my boyfriend insisted. It was deliiiicious and the sauce is like crack (we put it on my rice too). It was a bit expensive due to it being a seasonal dish and actually gave plenty of fish for the two of us. BASIL CHICKEN($12.95): No regrets here. I think you can get this with a different protein but I have had this twice with chicken and liked it both times. WATERCRESS (Seasonal): You gotta have a veggie dish to complement the protein dish. Usually, we get /dou miao/pea shoots but it was out of stock on our most recent visit.  Final verdict: Cafe 33 is very good (most of the time). I do think that with their increased popularity over the past few years, they have been slacking in quality of food. I think I will continue to dine here, and would say it's on my top 3 for Squirrel Hill.",

Its located right beside the Starbucks on Shady Ave. Parking is difficult- you need to find a spot on a side street somewhere.  They have a cute outdoor patio. When we went it was reserved so we sat inside.  I ordered the chicken with sa cha sauce and my husband ordered the stinky tofu. We also ordered the won ton soup to share. Servings are huge! We were able to bring it home and eat it again the next day. My chicken was delicious. The tofu was, stinky. I wasn't a fan but my husband liked it. My daughter ate a little bit of all of it.  Our waitress was fantastic. She made kids chopsticks for my daughter to use. So cute! We will be back!",

We also got a double sauted pork belly and a plate of watercress. The pork belly dish was quite good but the vegetable priced at $14 was disappointingly bland. The service was decent and the location is amazing. 3/5 from me.",

When you seek to explore new cuisine, you want two things: (1) the food is good, and (2) there is staff in the restaurant that help you choose the right items. For this place, not only these two were satisfied, but also the guy helped us how to eat some of the items. For example, the soup dumpling - one should put it in the soup spoon to avoid wasting any of the soup. Amazing! We'll be back, we did try the shrimp and lobster sauce over rice and the  fried chicken over rice apart from the soup dumpling - but this is only our first time. Highly recommended! Five stars.",

But it has.  The space used to be an urban laundromat & never boasted any good parking. The restaurant owners have done a good job of converting the small space into a restaurant.  The food is very different from what I'd expected. The flavors are light and refreshingly different from your standard Main Street Chinese restaurants. My favorite is their water cress which is sauteed with a hint of garlic and which I can have with plain steamed rice. Other dishes that I've liked include their sweet & sour pork and shrimp. Their marinated mushroom appetizer is another memorable dish.  All in all it has the feel of one of those hole-in-the-wall places in NYC where you (quite unexpectedly) find amazing cuisine.",

Let me start off by saying that it is most definitely authentic and the menu itself is pretty extensive. What I enjoyed was the different options; everyone loves options. We started off with pork and vegetable wonton soup. This came out in a fairly large bowl, so we all split it 4 ways. They didn't skimp out on wontons, vegetables or broth (thats important). I think it's safe to say that we all enjoyed this soup very much! For my entree, I ordered the duck yolk pork chops. The breading was nice and crispy, however, they kept the bone in almost ever piece. This was kind of frustrating, so I can't say that I was a fan of that part. My cousin ordered the sweet and sour pork chops and they also had the bone left inside. My mom and aunt ordered the vegetable rice noodle dish and really talked it up the entire time we were there. Some things to keep in mind, parking isn't the greatest and it's not the biggest restaurant. Expect a wait.",

    "text": "YAY for another Asian eatery in the 'Burgh!  While I wasn't thrilled with my meal here, I fully acknowledge that a restaurant needs ample time to feel out its kinks and fine tune to become the best possible version of itself, so I hope to be able to upgrade this review at a later date...a much later date.  However, any extra competition in the market for this cuisine makes me too excited to wait to try it, and Rose Tea Cafe could certainly stand to get knocked out of their comfort zone.  The effort was certainly there--the dining room was sleekly adorned, if crowded (during our Saturday lunch, they set out a plastic folding table in the center aisle to accommodate a party), and the staff was warm and welcoming, both unusual qualities for an authentic Asian restaurant.  It would be nice though if the servers could educate themselves about menu items, because they found it difficult to answer most of our questions about the dishes and had to run back and forth between our table and the kitchen to help us figure things out.  My unfamiliarity with the nuances of typical Taiwanese cooking and traditional dishes, coupled with my extreme pickiness, er, I mean, measured selectivity, meant I had a lot of questions.  Sorry not sorry.  Also, any restaurant that designates dishes at market price should at the very least anticipate questions about that.  We settled on the STEAMED MINI SOUP PORK BUNS (A16), MARINATED HOT PEPPER (A21), BE FENG TONG SHRIMP (E6), CHICKEN WITH BASIL IN CASSEROLE (C1), MINCED PORK WITH CHIVE STEM IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE (P17), and SAUTEED KING MUSHROOM WITH SALT & PEPPER (V11).  My friend had wanted to try the PUMPKIN WITH DUCK YOLK (V12), but it was priced at a \"SP\" of $17.50, which, unless those preserved duck eggs are from organic, pasture-raised ducks and the pumpkin is one of Dan Barber's artisanally-bred Blue Hill Farms mini-squash, is pretty far-out ridiculous.  And I wanted my favorite water spinach, or SAUTEED SEASONAL CHINESE VEGETABLE (V6), but not enough to fork over $14.50 for something that costs $2 to make.  Market prices.  They're the best.  All dishes tasted passable but not great--a general lack of flavor made it difficult for the food to wow us.  A slightly heavier hand with salt would have been appreciated in general.  You could taste that the pork buns COULD have been nice and porky...except that they were bland.  This was particularly sad because the aroma was there, and they even brought out a small dish of black vinegar with shredded ginger to dip them in, but the lack of seasoning just killed it.  This was also True of the peppers, which seemed like they had been marinated in oil with absolutely no salt (they tasted purely of heat), and the chicken with basil, which was pleasantly saucy but had no taste of basil.  The meat was also not the best quality--extra gristly.  Sad. The pork dish overwhelmed with an aroma of oyster sauce more than anything else, which wasn't a BAD thing, except that we were hoping for the black bean taste as the name enticed, which really got shoved to the side.    However, my single greatest letdown was the mushroom dish, my own choice off the menu, which came out deep-fried.  Perhaps this was partially my fault--perhaps this dish is always deep-fried and, being a novice to Taiwanese food, I otherwise would have expected this obvious fact or should have asked for yet another clarification on.  But, as it stands, I saw \"sauteed\" on the menu, and I didn't question that they would be simply wok-fried naked, as I expected.  They were rock-hard and remained largely untouched by our table.  My bad, guys.  I did not try the shrimp, as they which were similarly deep-fried, and I was feeling frier-jaded after my mushroom fail, but my 2 out of 3 of my companions seemed to enjoy them (my fiance just informed me that he found them lackluster).  They were nicely sized at least and came adorned with a sort of dry rub coated breading.  So yeah, not my best work, and it may be a while before I work up the will to return to this establishment again.  However, with the super large menu and the warm, Mandarin-speaking staff, I remain hopefully for vast improvement.  I'm rooting for you, Cafe' 33.  Just one question though--what's with the apostrophe?",

    "text": "Another Taiwanese eatery has arrived in Squirrel Hill, and just a short walk away from the original Rose Tea. AFAIK they are not associated together, but either the owner or one of the operators at Cafe 33 was previously at Rose Tea. So in that sense, it's pretty legit. Being new, the space is nicer and more spacious, but smaller like the size of Everyday Noodles. The menu has a lot of variety and is similar to Rose Tea's (as with pricing), but from what I could gather there is less emphasis on bubble teas and more on traditional Taiwanese appetizers. Didn't try any of the apps this time but the lady did recommend them for next time.  The beef noodle soup and pork belly over rice are two quintessential Taiwanese dishes. They were both solid in terms of presentation and quantity. The rice contained a tasty marinated egg, both diced pork and pork chunks, and pickled bamboo and cucumber. This was good, although I've had better--the pork could have been softer and less dry. Probably comparable to Rose Tea here. The beef noodle soup was another story. Everything from the savory broth to the soft and tender beef to the spongy noodles was perfect. Complementing all that was a smattering of chopped up and pickled vegetables. It was definitely authentic and probably one of the best around, being much more complex than that of Everyday Noodles but also better done than at Rose Tea.   Will update this review after a few more chances to try other things here!",

I ordered online and added a request to separate the rice and the dish, that's because the time on the road will make the rice too soaked and more greasy. What I got is a rude text \"Can't do\"  with no explanation. Then I decided to call, that's when things get ridiculous. The angry guy picked up the phone and have no patience to hear me out, keep interrupting me like an ignorant. My point is that I'm just asking a separate box, it's the same dish and same amount.  I could understand if he just patiently and politely explain the situation. But they are hostile and feels like I'm taking a huge advantage of them. After shouting on the phone they immediately cancelled my order. I know that apparently they are so \"popular\" that they do not care about loosing any customer. But I need to make this clear. Your customers aren't your ENEMY! Learn to be respectful.",

We had the stinky tofu, pig blood hotpot (), and twice cooked pork. All were delicious and completely satisfied my cravings.  The stinky tofu was a little bigger than what I imagined, but just as delicious. And the Taiwanese style kimchi was very refreshing paired with the fried tofu. The pig blood hotpot was a good sized portion and full of sour cabbages, pig blood, and intestine (sounds nasty but I promise so good). The twice cooked pork, curiously, comprised of bacon like meat instead of a thicker cut meat that I remember this dish should be made of. But nevertheless very good!  All in all a great meal!",

I liked them, but would venture on to something else next time.  The boyfriend had the short ribs with spicy sauce.  I sampled one and gave it the seal of approval.  It was crispy and flavorful and just spicy enough.  He did say that a couple of pieces were spicier than the one I tasted, which he appreciated.   I got the chicken basil.  I actually didn't love this dish, but it was mostly because it was a poor impulse choice given what I was actually in the mood for.  It was a well done dish, though, so I can't blame it for my being unsatisfied.    My main criticism would be that there are actually too many options.  The menu was 5 or 6 pages long, with just basic descriptions.  I had trouble sifting through it all and I definitely had trouble picturing what some of the options would look like.  Some of that is my own ignorance of the cuisine, but I appreciate a restaurant that attempts to help a girl out.  I don't need a picture menu or anything, but a website with some photos or expanded descriptions would have been helpful.   I also didn't know whether they serve alcohol or are BYOB or what.  We had bubble tea and water, but weren't offered anything else.  Again, these are things I would typically look up online before going, but there wasn't any website available that I could find.",

They seemed to have forgotten our reservation, because the staff seemed to freak out when our group started to showed up.  They were able to seat us when we were all there, but it was a tight squeeze at our table.  Besides that initial confusion with our reservation, everything was amazing.  The food was fantastic.  Us veggies had the turnip cake as an appetizer, it's a solid appetizer choice that I'll be getting the next time I'm there.  There were four vegetarians in our group and we ordered family style, so I got to try the sauteed vegetables, the eggplant with garlic, the kimchi hot pot, and the Mapo tofu.  The sauteed vegetables and the eggplant with garlic were my favorite dishes.  The next time I have a craving for Taiwanese (which is surprisingly often), I'll be coming here.",

Stinky tofu is good, not as stinky as the ones in Taiwan but the way they fry the tofu makes the texture similar to Taiwanese stinky tofu (crispy on the outside and soft and juicy in the inside). Xiao Long Bao is also pretty nice, which I didn't expect. The owners were also very friendly.  There is one dish probably not authentic, which is the Intestine with sour cabbage.

    "text": "Pictures on yelp showed a very promising Taiwanese cuisine in the midst of Squirrel Hill.  We went for a late dinner with no wait.  Our server was a sweet lady who was prompt and funny.  I was surprised by the good service here since it can be a hit or miss at Asian establishments (if you want to be abused, head down to Rose Tea Cafe).  We also saw how other servers interacted with other customers.  Hella respect for good old service.  Majority of the menu items are Taiwanese, but there are some Korean and Cantonese dishes in the mix.  We ordered the soup dumplings, sauteed chinese watercress, cantonese soy sauce stir-fry noodle, and beef with chinese hot pepper entree.  All that for two people.  We definitely need to be back to try the rest of the menu.  But here's the breakdown of the food we tried:  Soup dumpling - LOVE IT!  Out of all the ones I've tried in PIttsburgh, I love it here best.  The soup is flavorful, the dumpling skin does not rupture, and the soup is not dried up (plenty in there).  Sauteed chinese watercress - good, as expected.  Chinese watercress (or water spinach) is one of my favorites.  Cantonese soy-sauce stir-fry noodle - very salty and a bit more wet than the typical ones I've had.  Beef with chinese hot pepper - Not the best I've had.  The beef was cut very thin and the hot pepper was spicier than what I'm used to.  Not sure if \"chinese hot pepper\" is the same as what other Taiwanese places uses, which is \"longhorn pepper\".  The heat was manageable after a few bites.  The dish is still great, but I don't think I will be craving it from here.  Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33 is absolutely a 4 star to start.  I'm curious whether the Korean food is any good here.  That's for next time!",

It's on the same block as How Lee, Rose Tea, etc.   A group of 5 came here this past Sunday and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. Here are some highlights:  - Indoor and Outdoor seating - Street Parking or park behind the Dunkin Donuts - Authentic Taiwanese dishes such as stinky tofu, bean curd, scallion pancake roll with beef, XLB etc. - Food was good. A tiny bit on the pricey side compared to the other places but definitely would come back. It was $20 per person including tip. - Service was a little slow but that's probably because it was a busy Saturday night. We ordered a ton of spicy dishes and happened to be drenching in our own sweat without any water.   I will definitely try some more dishes here. A great addition to the Asia Food scene in Squirrel Hill.",

It came with eight and was perfect for sharing. The dumpling skin is very thin and will probably rip on your chopsticks, but man is it delicious.  Then we split the Taiwanese squid and shrimp in lobster sauce for dinner. I cannot rave enough about this squid. It was paired with so many fresh vegetables and really showcased the squid. The waitress insisted we tried this and I do not regret that decision at all. I have become accustomed to dishes that feature seafood to skimp on the portions but both had very sizable amounts of seafood.   The menu is full of wonderful options that range from $6-$20. We got all of the above for $30. My next visit, which will be sooner rather than later, I plan to just order what the customers next to me are having because they all seemed to be pros.",

I thought the food was good but I think my experience was clouded by our table in the middle of the floor and constantly being bumped by the staff who would rearrange our table constantly just to have it rearranged by someone else.  I would go again but probably request a table against a wall.  I tried the Lo Mein noodles with chicken; next time I'm excited to try something else!  I would suggest the dumplings they were realllllyyyy good!  Additionally, the employees were super nice :)",

I got sweet and sour ribs the most recent time i ordered cafe 33. It was delicioussss! I still think the price could be lower though, I ordered the sweet and sour ribs and Taiwanese tempura fish. The total came out to be $18+. The Taiwanese tempura fish tastes better when I ordered it in store the first time. It might be due to the to go order using a closed container, causing the fish to be less crispy on the outside. I would say Cafe 33 and everyday noodles are my two favorite Taiwanese places in Pittsburgh. I highly recommend it!!",

    "text": "Food-good. Portions-average (small for an Asian restaurant). Service-disappointing. We are big fans of Taiwanese cuisine and knew we had to try it here. Had heard great things and knew a little of the history. The first time we were there, they were so nice and accommodating. The next time; not so much. The next, no better. The last time the service was just dreadful. And then one day when we asked (very early in the day) if we could make a reservation for 10 people they thought it would be OK to put all of us at a table for 6. No, that wasn't going to work. It made me realize they really didn't value us as customers. I do feel a bit like a sardine when I've been there. I've gone back the times I have as others have raved about their experiences and they ask us to go along. Well, the food is good, but I'm paying for an experience, not just food. I can make food at home-or I can order take out. Going out for dinner is a social activity that I enjoy. But, with so many other great Asian restaurants in the area, I think I'll try them all before heading back here.",

Generally speaking, I would say that their food is more based on their home style, traditional foods and not so much Americanized-Asian food but nonetheless it is worth trying! A complaint would have to be parking and the size of the restaurant. First of all, parking in Squirrel Hill is just impossible and if it's your first time visiting, it's located behind the Starbucks! Secondly, their restaurant is very tiny and not very accommodating for large groups or parties. Speaking from experiences, I had difficulty maneuvering in and out of my seat and table because of the small proximity. It's great for parties of four or less.   All in all, I do enjoy their food because it's very similar and reminiscent to home cooked meals. You do get large portions and each entree comes with a bowl of white rice. Also, I don't believe there is a cork fee which is a plus! I recommend it to anyone who likes authentic Taiwanese/Asian food.",

    "text": "This place often seems busy, and it only takes one dine in experience to see why.   The service is good, the food is good, but it's fairly expensive. Their boba tea is better than rose cafe. (Everything about this place is better than Rose Cafe which is a short distance away)  My friends and I  lose our minds for the soup dumplings you get here.  You put them in your mouth after they cool off from being fresh out the kitchen and it's like literally eating flavorful little soup bomb water balloons of deliciousness. So fun to eat!  Also, the jellyfish celery salad is even better than I could have hoped. The texture was chewy but had a crunch, and was savory.  I could have eaten a full entree of that, rather than just an appetizer.   They're pretty okay for take out, though we've had them forget items when we've done this instead of eating in. Go with a group so you can share different entrees and try ALL THE THINGS!  I gave 3 stars because my issue is that the host at the front stared at us after we finished eating, and so we felt kinda rushed out.  Also, the server doubted my choice of order, because I wanted to try the jellyfish, but he seemed to want to steer me away from it-- not sure why. I have a feeling it was because he judged me by my looks and thought maybe I wouldn't like the texture?  It remains a mystery.",

We ordered the Taiwanese sticky rice, Short ribs with black pepper, basil fish fillet and braised beef over rice. Everything was on point! Highly recommended.",

But there are also old standbys we adore. I love the beef and egg plant, and we usually get the soup buns too. Highly recommend this place!",

So when we decided to meet up with a few friends in Pittsburgh, I looked up restaurant reviews and found this nice little gem. We ordered salt & pepper chicken (not impressed), soup dumplings (yummm), taiwanese watercress (legit awesomeness), 3 cup chicken (it's alright), and minced pork over rice (also legit yumminess). I mean, the soup dumplings were great, but the taiwanese watercress though was just amazing. One bite and it took me right back to childhood in Taiwan. The minced pork over rice was flavorful, sure it may be a little greasy, but fat is where the flavor is. All in all, I was very happy with our meal.",

    "text": "Came here with my mom. It was both of our first times.  Atmosphere: Never noticed this place before given it's kind of hidden and tucked behind Starbucks. But it's cute, cosy, and casual.   Service: Water came quickly as well as our food. Waiter asked us if peanuts on the Gua Bao were okay in case we had allergies. We don't, but it was nice that he asked anyway. I've never had that experience at a restaurant before. Waiter was overall very prompt and friendly. He didn't check on us much but the place was packed so we didn't mind.   Food:   Steamed Dumplings: I had one and I wasn't a huge fan, but my mom loved them. She said they were flavorful and fresh and not greasy at all.  Mini Pork Soup Dumplings: I love soup dumplings and I was curious to see how they compared to other soup dumplings I had enjoyed in the area (right down the street are Everyday Noodle and Sun Penang which both have excellent soup dumplings). These were pretty good, although they weren't as plump with soup as I'm used to, and there wasn't much meat either. The flavor was excellent though and I would still recommend them.   Gua Bao (Pork Bun): The vegetables were really fresh and crisp and the meat was flavorful. You get one bun but it's big enough to share. It's a bit of a messy eat, and I wished I had some more pork and less veggie, but I would still recommend.  Mixed Seafood Over Rice: My mom ordered this. She thought that sauce was flavorful, not too oily or heavy, and the vegetables were (once again) very fresh. She also enjoyed that they give you a healthy portion of seafood.   Minced Braised Pork Over Rice: This is another favorite of mine over at Everyday Noodle. Once again the flavors were good, but I was disappointed with the lack of meat. About  of the bowl consisted of kimchi and the same pickled veggies mixture that came on the pork bun. I didn't really want all of that. I would prefer more pork to go with the Rice.   Overall: Very tasty food with excellent service. I will definitely be back to try more apps and some of the other dishes. Will definitely be recommending this place to others.   Score: 4.5/5",

We liked everything about it (cleanliness, service, nice music background, ambiance)... except of food.  All four dishes we've tried (marinated cabbage, cucumber salad, XLB dumplings and chive/egg pancakes) were ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS!  I always thought that Taiwanese cuisine is full of flavors and spices, but they proved me wrong. If it would be my first experience with this cuisine I would never wanted to repeat it again. And for this kind of taste and portion sizes it seems to me very overpriced. So what is the point of going to restaurant if you like everything else, but the food?",
