    "text": "I loved everything about this place!  Came in for lunch with a friend and was immediately impressed by the clean and cozy decor and delicious smells.  There is a set menu of sandwiches/salads that I am sure is worthy of attention, but before I could read more than two words I spotted the case housing the daily specials- meatloaf, crispy chicken, smothered pork chops, chipotle shrimp fettuccine, or gumbo topped with a choice of protein for the entrees along with sweet potato casserole, garlic mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and cajun greens for the sides.  I decided to go with the meatloaf, sweet potato casserole, and greens and my friend chose the fettuccine, ensuring that we would both be in a nice food-induced coma when we made it back to work.  The food came out within 5-10 minutes and everything was amazing.  All of the food here is made in-house from scratch and to top things off each plate also included a giant, buttery roll.  On top of the great food, the service was outstanding.  Our server was incredibly friendly and was happy to stop and chat with us when we bombarded him with questions about the restaurant.  He also let us walk over to check out the section next door that is Bistro Soul, the catering part of the restaurant.  It looks like it would be a great venue for a smaller event (showers, retirement/anniversary parties, etc.).  Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the hot entree prices seemed a little bit steep, but all together my food and drink came to a total of $12.75 and completely filled me up.  Also, their sandwich and salad options were a little bit less expensive (I think about $8) so were more comparable to typical chain lunch spots and if they are anything like the hot entrees are much higher quality.    One other definite plus- the drink selections included every single flavor of Boylan Soda (Birch Beer, Cane Soda, Creme Soda, etc etc).  Just add delicious on top of delicious.  They also allow BYOB.",

I love the sandwhich with ham, cheese, green apples and onion on the bread cheese roll.  Staff is always super attentive and pleasant.  Good for vegetarians, comfortable dining room.    Definitely worth going to for lunch and dinner for homestyle classic meals and some well done inventive dishes.",

What an unexpected gem on East Ohio Street, with charming decor and architecture, extremely friendly service, and a delicious array of food.  I felt so welcome from the minute I approached the counter to the minute I left, it was almost like I was visiting someone's home.  While this is somehow listed as \"caterers\" on Yelp, it is definitely open for eating in for lunch or taking out back to the office. I had chicken and a side dish, which were way better than fast food but without the time commitment of a sit-down restaurant. The dining area is a good size and they bring the food to you and apparently just began cleaning up after you as well.   I will definitely go back!",

Nikki worked with me to create a customized menu within my price range.  I also had a vision for the way the food was displayed.  Nikki embraced my vision and executed it perfectly.  I would highly recommend Nikki and her excellent staff for any event.  In addition to catering our wedding we had our rehearsal dinner in her space next door to the Bistro.  Again the food, staff and ambiance was amazing!",

Plus, the staff is super nice and the decor is eclectic and fun.   I wouldn't say you should search out this breakfast buffet since it was only above average, but it is a great place if you're looking for something different for breakfast.  I'm also planning to head back for their lunch and dinner selections- the menu looks good and I expect the ingredients to be fresh.",

We also had our wedding catered from here a few years back and people raved about the food but that is a different story :).  They have a cute little outside space in between both restaurants with plants and cute hanging lights.  It's also byob so we enjoyed some mimosas on this beautiful Sunday morning.

The prices are pretty good, but this is a place I tired of because it is very homey and I can cook like this so why go out. Went for the sunday brunch that was advertised in an e-mail and was disappointed.It wasn't a brunch, only a breakfast with nothing spiecial. The eggs I asked for over medium were cooked over easy which means runny whites, so I couldn't eat them. The sides were mostly cold. The potatoes were good tasting but cold. The bacon was either raw or burnt and again cold. I didn't try the sausage or the french toast because I was afraid it was cold. The other thing that bothers me is that every buffet that I've been to has you use a clean plate every time you go get food and this place gives you one plate to use over and over. This means that if you use ketchup on your eggs and potatoes then you get ketchup on your sweet roll and fruit, yuck! There are better places to go for the money.",

It's simply delish.  I ordered a pan of it for a friend's party and let's just say I was the most popular girl in attendance - everyone raved about it :-) The daily specials are a gourmet variety: cod, salmon, pork chops, meatloaf, pasta, etc.  The sides are less exciting, but the cranberry chicken salad is A+.  They have a charming courtyard, which is great for Spring/Summer dining.  The staff is friendly, professional, and accommodating and the atmosphere is airy and light - high ceilings and large windows w/ jazz playing in the background.  The presentation is perfection.  Keep in mind, it's a bistro/gourmet deli...so, not worth a trip across town, but you should most definitely give it a try if your in the vicinity (North Side, Strip District, Downtown, etc.).  You'll be pleasantly surprised!",

They recommended the perfect amount of food for the number of guests.  The food was excellent--we had sandwiches, salad, and pierogies--not fancy but much nicer than your average deli spread.  Price is great for what you get.  One slip--they forgot to include the vegetarian sandwiches I ordered--but the guy who delivered returned in 20 minutes with a whole tray of them.  Would most definitely use them again to cater a daytime, informal event in Pittsburgh.",

My first time here I wasn't impressed and the second time I went with a co-worker and had a country fried chicken with Mac and cheese and I'm a snob when it comes to both of those things and it tasted so comforting. I enjoyed every bite and it made me want to fall asleep at my desk. Today I gave it a go and tried their New Orleans Gumbo and it left little to be desired. I asked the polite lady behind the counter if it was spicy and she said yes only for me to get back to my desk and it was barely seasoned let alone spicy. Next time they have the fried chicken and Mac and cheese I will most definitely be there. I love that they change their menu up every day. I also enjoy their rolls. The rolls alone make up anything else on your plate.  Would I eat here again? Maybe! Would I make this a regular lunch spot? Probably not! The staff is nice and sometimes you get some really good food. And they also have a Coke Freestyle machine which is awesome sauce.",

She was completely willing to modify their standard menus/packages to reach a set-up that met our needs.  We went for two tastings, and both times, we were amazed by both the quality and selection of food (along with our ability to consume and unbelievable amount of food in one sitting... come hungry!).  The catering for our wedding itself was professional, and the food wasn't incredibly different than what we tried at the restaurant (usually not the case).  The cons:  One of our buffet items never made it to the line for the reception.  In addition, there was a mix up with our cake where they didn't cut enough and half of it ended up being left at the hall (ARGH!  the sorrows of wasted burnt almond torte!).  Overall though, Nikki and the catering manager were great about admitting the mistakes and making it up to us, offsetting what would of otherwise been a 3 star review.  Bottom line:  If you're looking for a caterer downtown or in the surrounding area...  Bistro is a great place to go to.",

    "text": "I recently chose Bistro To Go as the caterer of our company picnic. They were very easy to work with for ordering and a wide range of options - not just the boring catering lasagna and chicken. We had them deliver to the house where the event was held, they set up everything very quickly, gave us everything we needed, and were on their way!  Our guest LOVED the food. The hummus and dip spread was a hit with all kids and adults. The salmon had a yummy dressing. The burgers went quickly. The salad was fresh and the homemade dressing went perfectly with it. The one item people are still talking about it the black bean croquettes with spicy ranch. I have a co-worker even trying to find the recipe! Oh - and the pricing was very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered. Portions are pretty large, so either weigh your options of ordering less or preparing for leftovers!",

Unfortunately, due to a job change, I will not be able to continue going as often as I would like. The staff is friendly and the food comes out really fast. For someone who has some dietary restrictions, this place has been a saving grace for me! I've never tried any of the prepared food options I haven't liked, and the made-to-order salads and sandwiches are fantastic as well. This review is long overdue -  I highly recommend Bistro To Go!",

    "text": "You lost my loyalty at $1.75 for a bag of chips today!  I am willing to pay for a side or extras but this was your typical 50 cents portion, or even the free bag that most places give. I was splitting  the delicious classic bistro sandwich with a friend today and the chips were right by the register.  At first I thought, they were part of the deal and I threw in two with our sandwich purchase.  The total was over $12 but the sandwich was only $8.  I was perplexed so I asked and she told me that it was almost $4 for the chips.  My first thought was to cancel the order but she informed me she already completed the order.  There wasn't a sign on the basket of chips indicating how much they were, if so they wouldn't sell any.  In addition, when I was duped she was pretty much refusing to cancel my order.     I was also excited to find out that the soup of the day was veggie chili.  It was priced accordingly: $3.95, half pint, $6.50 for a pint and $12 for a quart.  I honestly thought she was kidding!! I am by no means a cheap person but there comes a point where you say, why would I ever come back here?  I support new and local businesses but I am also not a fool.  If you don't last, it's because of your outrageous prices not because your food isn't tasty.",

They also had crab cakes with a lemon dill sauce. Very fresh and mini turkey Ruben sandwiches. Those went very fast and everyone loved them. The fruit salad was fresh and flavorful. We also brought our own cupcakes and they set them up nice on a tray for us. They are open during the week and have a regular menu.

They make really cute boxed lunches ($10.95/person) for events!  A few days ago, I indulged in the most amazing Tomato, Basil, and Mozzarella sandwich.  It was served on an Asiago baguette with fresh basil, tomatoes, red onions, buffalo mozzarella and spring mix, drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette.  It was seriously amazing with the big thick slice of mozzarella and the perfect blend of everything else.  It came with a side of Pasta Salad.  While the pasta salad was good and had tomatoes and cucumbers, it uses an Italian vinaigrette, which was quite a bit of vinaigrette including the sandwich.  It was a bit too dressed for my taste but really good nonetheless.  The chips and cookie made a complete meal.  I really never head over to the Northside, but if I do, I will check this place out in person!",

I ordered the Award Winning Smokey Grilled Cheese and I must say, it was probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had made at a restaurant. It was cheesy and gooey and creamy with a crispy buttery bread, just like grilled cheese should be. I could eat those everyday! I would have given Bistro 5 stars if it had not been for the chicken and rice soup. It was VERY run of the mill. Nothing made it stand out from any other chicken and rice soup, restaurant or can. For $5 I was expecting a soup that was gonna blow my mind. I know not to order that again! The service was quick and friendly. The cashier was very friendly. It's a little bit of a tight squeeze in the restaurant, but I got my food to go, so I didn't mind so much. Based of the grilled cheese alone, I would recommend Bistro to Go. I'll try a different soup next time.",

While I did not interact with the planning, my parents described how the staff were so welcoming and accommodative when they went to try them out at their location and then talk about the event.  While they had their normal catering menu, they said they would make anything my mom wanted.  We ended up with several entrees that were favorites of her and her mother, including a pork picnic (with the crispy pieces of outer fat); leg of lamb; and meatballs bolognese (for the younger attendees), plus sides and appetizers.  The three staff members sent to run the event, who I dealt with, were equally friendly and professional (supposedly they are hand picked for the event and the hosts' personalities).  We left them to work while we were at the anniversary vow renewal, and when we returned, they had set up three wonderful trays of cheese and vegetables (plus passed hot appetizers), folded all the napkins, and set the tables.  They then brought out the main course, buffet style, and bused and washed the dishes.  The entrees were incredible, especially the apple infused jus for the pork, and the vegetables were crisp and flavorful (broccolini in lemon butter was my favorite).  The family will happily be eating a lot of leftovers through Thanksgiving, with some great memories to go along with them.  The work Bistro to Go did could not have been any better.",

Plus, the \"to go\" is represented well with fast and prompt delivery of the goods... the food I mean!  I was craving a chicken salad sandwich and surprise, it was on the menu as a raspberry almond chicken salad served on a croissant.  Done!  The salad part was very tasty, with enough mayo to satisfy my saucy needs, but not too little to make it dry.  The croissant was so moist and buttery.  It wasn't firm by any means, so the sandwich kinda fell apart.  It didn't matter tome though because it was VERY good!    I loved the help yourself iced tea as well.  They had two different kinds, a sweetened peach and regular unsweetened tea.  The peach was incredibly sweet so I mixed the two and it was just perfect.    I can't wait to go back and order up more items on their menu and also stop by Bistro Soul that's connected to this one.  And try this wonderful $10 brunch buffet I've heard so much about!",

Medium sized place with tables for mostly small parties (2-4 people).   FOOD: Came for Sunday brunch. We thought there was a brunch buffet, but that is no longer the case here. Got the french toast with two sides (bacon and scrambled eggs). Both sides were done well, nothing super special. However, the french toast--this was what made the dish mouth-watering.    I couldn't really pin point the fantastic flavors I tasted, but the french toast seemed to have a hint of cinnamon and pumpkin/pecan (or something??) with syrup drizzled on top. I couldn't figure out the taste, but I did know the french toast was delicious.   SERVICE: Extremely kind people and staff. Did not laugh at our confused faces when answering our questions regarding the case of the missing Sunday brunch :(.   IMPRESSIONS:  I enjoyed the brunch. It's pretty typical brunch fare that is done well (get the french toast!), but what really stood out to me was the atmosphere. It's not too crowded, it's quiet, and it's a cute place with great customer service. This gives Bistro to Go an automatic leg up compared to other brunch spots that tend to be noisy and over packed--with people glaring at you in hopes you eat faster so they could get a turn at your table. I don't handle that kind of pressure well. Here, you can take your time. If you're looking for a nice sit-down brunch place to relax and take things slow, this is your spot.   Again, no breakfast buffet unless it's a special occasion like Mother's Day. I don't think they changed this info on the website though, hence our confusion.",

I say that and happily give them five stars for the very reason they are a successful business! Nikki was able to answer any and all questions and allay my anxiety. The food and presentation was exceptional in look and flavor, the staff (a mother and her daughter) I forget their names sorry, were attentive and made us feel very welcome as they not only kept the food stations full and ready they mingled among the family making sure people had everything and knew what was available! Can't thank you all enough, it really did help make our family reunion that much more special! Thanks again!",

East Ohio Street can be a scary place with a unique mix of individuals (the fact that there are three pay day loan storefronts is a good indication ).  So it is nice to have a place that is a little nicer and offers variety .    There is a standard menu along with weekly specials.  Items are pre made and displayed and plated and heated when you order.  I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy, but I have been disappointed a time or two thinking I would love a dish and then just finding it to meh.  I like their sandwiches better than their hot entrees and you get a nice variety when you do the soup /sandwich combo.  My favorite is the chicken salad.    In the summer they have a cute outdoor seating area.  The unfortunate thing is that it overlooks the previously mentioned East Ohio Street.  It is worth a visit if you work in the area or need a good spot for a lunch meeting, but it isn't someplace to go out of your way for.",

    "text": "Came here for a Sunday brunch before I went to the airport. Thought we had come to the wrong place, but little did I know. By day, this place is a caterer. By weekend, it's a full service traditional breakfast/brunch buffet. The food is exceptionally prepared, and I was wanting of nothing when there.  There were all the traditional breakfast items: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, french toast... etc. There's an omelette bar as well, where one of the chef's will make an omelette to your choosing. There's also plenty of pastries, bagels, and fruit as well.  Each dish is prepared very professionally, where I can tell that quality counts. The french toast does not taste like mass produced french toast, rather individually battered and grilled french toast. It's simply delicious.  There is cranberry and OJ, and if you pour 2/3 OJ and 1/3 Cranberry, you get a delightful drink that is greater than the sum of its parts.   Overall, I don't want to shoot myself in the foot with this place. It's definitely a gem, and I don't want it to get overcrowded, because the food here is prepared to an excellence as befitting its catering reputation. However, I feel guilty keeping this place to the select few that know about it.  So go, and enjoy.",

    "text": "Discovering new areas of the city allows you to discover new eateries that you had no clue existed.  This, at least to me, is none Truer than on the North Side of the city.  I hardly ventured there in the years prior.  Not because I didn't want to, but because I had no real reason to do so.  I have found myself on the North Side more and more recently.  How else would I have stumbled upon this gem?  Believe it or not we were actually on our way to another spot before we even considered this place.  When we arrived there we found that they were not to open for another few hours.  But when you are hungry, your stomach doesn't wait.  So we had started back to the car and I noticed this spot, if it wasn't for me taking a quick peak at the inside, we probably would have never stepped foot inside here.    They captured the whole bistro feel inside here.  I noticed that the seating here really didn't match but it gave it a great feel.  I also noticed that there was an outside area where you can sit in the warmer months.  It's not out front, but it looks like a really cozy area to enjoy a meal.  This place is set up kind of like cafeteria style.  You can't really tell what will be on the menu until you step inside.  It's my understanding that the menu rotates often, so you may never have the same meal twice here.  The day that we were here I decided on the Country Chicken with potatoes.  This was delicious and I felt like I was having a gourmet meal in the middle of a posh area.  The chicken was nicely done and moist.  The gravy on it was savory and almost had me licking my plate.  The potatoes were more smashed than mashed and as you can see from the picture some of the skins were still mixed in, one of my favorite things.  It may sound like an oxymoron, but this was a quick, fancy meal to be having.  I was definitely surprised by the quality of food and left here with a full belly.  Definitely worth a venture if you want some of the best comfort food the North Side has to offer.",

The cafe is a cute little spot for lunch. There are several hot food and soup options that change each day. They also have standard made to order sandwiches and salads. I've had the gumbo, salmon and power salad. All really great and fresh. The hot food items can be limiting if you're vegan. I went with a friend one day and she was very disappointed by the options that were available that day. She ended up just getting a salad. Which at least she was able to eat something but I think if you're hoping for a hot meal you may be limited in that aspect.   Once you figure out what you want ordering is very smooth and fast. All the food is brought out to you if you're eating inside the cafe. And they'll come and grab your stuff when you're done too!   In the winter it can get a little cold if your by the door but I think it's something that is out of their hands in their current space. Just be sure to try and grab a seat away from the door.",

They treated us like family in going beyond the scope of what any caterer ever should.  I can't say enough about the service and care---AND THE FOOD!!! Forget about it!  This is my caterer for LIFE. Whatever your catering needs are, call Bistro first. My standards are very high and I demand excellence in everything I do, and I require the same of anyone else I engage.  Sadly very few measure up--But Bistro exceeded my expectations--again, Again, and AGAIN.  I don't get to write this kind of review very often, so this is an absolute pleasure. They not only love what they do, but they love GOD--- and it really shows.  It just doesn't get any better.",

Nikki was great to deal with and the servers who we booked were very professional and very nice to all of our guests.    Would like to give rating of 4.5 stars.  Only 2 recos for Bistro To Go:  1) A call within a couple of days to confirm everything would be great.  The only communication we had once we booked was to get paid. 2) They do not provide serving tables, etc. - a recommendation on how many tables, etc. would be needed for planning would be good as well.  Will use again and have already recommended to 2 people.",

I ordered the cranberry almond chicken salad on a croissant and it was delicious, sweet and a little salty - absolutely perfect. Everyone was nice and the ambiance was fantastic.   The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they did not do a great job of showing what pastries they had. It looked like they had a few muffins behind the counter, but I didn't know what kind and it was unclear if they were even available. Additionally, they had a Coca Cola machine and refrigerator that kind of threw off the vibe. With those slight changes, this would no doubt be a 5 Star!

Cute interior that is decorated well and has nice little tables to sit in (including an outdoor space for nice days).   Vegan & gluten free friendly! They have lots of options for both which is a rare find!   Nice looking desserts that I'm going to have to come back to try. Can't wait to return for another lunch!",

It's literally cheaper than Subway, at least it can be. Because you can also splurge and get a dinner plate of preprepared entrees and sides that rotate every day, but always having the sandwhiches as a fallback.   Also, they have a very friendly staff!",
