    "text": "It seemed that The Yard had some changes in the kitchen and the menu- and not for the good. They changed the traditional sweet potato fries to waffle fries and they were flimsy and greasy. In fact, the \"battered\" French fries were not battered and again were limp and slimy. My caprese grilled cheese didn't have enough filling to cover the entire sandwich and the bread didn't have any toasted color to it, it seemed like just stale white bread. After I complained about it the waitress told me everything looked normal. The tomato soup was too thick and tart. The food on this visit is nothing like I've had during several different times doing here over the past year.  I'm not sure if there was a change in staff, management, or everyone is just getting lazy. Disappointing.",

    "text": "My friend and I had been meaning to check out The Yard all summer, since she's a huge grilled cheese fan and I can never get enough beer. We made it here last Monday and had a really nice experience overall. There were a few minor hiccups, but nothing to keep me from coming back again.  We came in just after happy hour had ended and were given a reasonable half hour wait time by the friendly hostess. After some window shopping on Walnut Street for around twenty minutes, we received a call from her that our table was ready. Our server approached us quickly and passed out some menus. The Yard has a large food and drinks menu, but it's laid out nicely and the beer list is particularly well-organized. I noticed that there was a Monday night special for $1 off all craft beer bottles, so I turned my attention to the bottle list. Our server came back suddenly and asked if we had \"At least decided on some drinks yet\"...it had been about five minutes and I felt terrible for holding him up if that's how he perceived it, so I immediately placed an order for a drink and gave him my food order as well so as not to waste his time. Now it almost certainly was just poor word choice on his part, but I was sort of taken aback to be addressed that way as I had never meant to take too long while reading the menu. (I pride myself on studying the menu online if it's available before I get to a new restaurant so I'm not holding anyone up.) It was only a small bit of unpleasantness though, and it quickly passed as we waited in such a delicious-smelling environment.   My beer arrived first with a severely broken glass, so unfortunately I had to request a replacement. The longer we were there the busier it seemed to get, so that was totally understandable. Thankfully I don't believe the food runner cut himself on it. Our food came soon after, and it was hot and fresh! Everything was plated attractively (a plus in my book) and it tasted just as great as it looked. I had the yard burger and my roommate had a grilled cheese and tomato soup. We both got sweet potato waffle fries, and based on those I would gladly try the other varieties of fries on offer! I appreciated that the burger was garnished with mixed greens rather than iceberg, and the bacon on top was of a higher quality than the typical bacon on burgers in Pittsburgh. I had planned on eating half and saving half for my lunch the following day, but everything was too delicious not to eat at once. My friend said the same thing about her grilled cheese, and since she's a fairly picky eater that's high praise from her.   When our checks came I saw that I hadn't been given the $1 off special for my craft beer bottle, but I decided not to make a huge deal about it since everything was still pretty busy around us. If I don't get any applicable discounts the next time I come I'll say something, but for the first time I'm willing to let it slide since the food was well worth it. I'd like to give The Yard 3.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me. I'll upgrade to a 4-star rating if I come back and the service and discount application improves just a bit.",

My grilled cheese was The Big Che-bowski. It was entirely underwhelming. First, to me what's great about a grilled cheese is buttery bread and melty cheese - I should have noted in other's posts that these are TOASTED cheese sandwiches so the bread is dry. Dipping it in the soup helped. The saddest parts of my sandwich were the two skinny slices of bacon that were criss-crossed on it (so 60% of the sandwich was bacon-free) and the wan, almost winter-white paper thin tomatoes (really? In August you have to TRY to find such poor product). The Thunder-Buddies dessert was NOT a grilled cheese, so I am still at a loss as to why that's what it was called.",

Happens to me all the time when i go out and I just assumed it was premade with the pico and rolled with it. However my date and her friend ordered chicken and waffles, this is where it was basically bad to worse. Starting off with the 3 saddest pieces of chicken I've ever seen. One girl actually offered the other some of her chicken but she really didn't have much to give. Worst part was when my date reached her last bite to find what looked like carpet fiber. Mortified obviously because who knows what she DIDNT see. The food also took forever but the waitress was nice. Probably won't be going back, $65 for that experience just doesn't cut it. Manager or whoever just kinda shrugged it off which compelled me to write this. Douche.",

Also I got literally one spoonful of soup-much less than the bowlful that I usually get. The fries were burnt and too crunchy and our waitress forgot to season them? Not worth the dollar that I am now being forced to pay. The sandwiches have also gotten smaller too, I would always get the mac attack and mac and cheese would be falling out of the sandwich but now there was barely enough? I was still hungry afterwards! It may have had to do with the fact that I went on a Monday night which is when the grilled cheeses are half off but that is no excuse for such decrease in quality.",

The prices are sort of high but it is worth it because the food is great.   They have multiple food options such as an assortment of grilled cheese, burgers, flatbread sandwiches and salads. For the sides you can choose from a selection of different fries, tomato soup, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, a veggie of the day or fruit. They also have a big drink and beer selection.   At this location I've had the crabby patty and the cheesy capresey, each time with the tomato soup and the sweet potato fries.  When you order the sweet potato fries, they come with a side of cinnamon butter to dip them in. I would highly recommend this place for lunch, a dinner get together, or a date.   In the late morning to mid afternoon they also serve brunch. I have never been there for brunch but have heard that they are really good (plus they serve mimosas!)",

We went during happy hour. The beer list is very extensive so if you like beer, you're sure to find something to suit your tastes. I was tempted by the $5 drink of the day, an \"adult cherry coke\" but went with a beer instead.  Our waiter was extremely pleasant and super helpful when it came to choosing from the menu. I was between a few different grilled cheeses and asked him for a recommendation. He said the Big Chew-bowski was his favorite out of my few options, so I went with that. I also got the sweet potato fries. They came with this delicious cinnamon flavored dip.   My grilled cheese was spectacular. I've never had a gourmet grilled cheese before. I definitely want to go back to try a few of the other ones. The only thing that was just okay was the tomato soup. Like other people have said, it just seems like condensed Cambells that got spices added to it. But it was nice to have to dip my sandwich into.   As if all that wasn't enough food, my friend ordered the cheesecake for dessert and let me take a few bites. It was very good. The berries and cream taste was wonderful and I was impressed by how light and creamy the cheesecake was. Usually cheesecake is very heavy, but this was just the right balance.  I definitely plan on coming back to the Yard soon!",

Ok, now away from the booze and onto the food.  I think the food was pretty good for the price (particularly in this part of Shadyside).

Both sandwiches came with fries (choose from four varieties), but they weren't great -- kind of soggy. Tomato soup was also included, which I thought was a nice touch.

That's what eating at The Yard is like.  I have never written a review before or cared enough about any place to do so, but dear god I have seen the light. I was already sold when a friend told me about a place with a menu just full of grilled cheeses, and it only got better. I ordered the Wac Arnold which appeared to be both comically and gustatorily sound. My fragile ego was not equipped to handle such a pure, immaculate sammich. I think I told everyone I know and accosted several strangers on the street to tell them how absurdly good it was. Not to mention the service, it looked like the server had the whole room to take care of by himself and he didn't miss a beat.   Though I may eat foods other than grilled cheese, and I may dine at restaurants that aren't The Yard, it will always be the first time a sandwich truly opened my eyes to how beautiful the world can be.

    "text": "I absolutely love this Bar as the newest addition to the Shadyside bar scene. The shop opened this past June and has quickly come to conquer the hearts of locals and various college students alike.  The place used to be a high end Italian stowaway. The dungeon feeling has been retained climbing a set of stairs down in order to get to the location. The space is divided into two portions, to the left - a long stone set bar top lined with drafts and a humongous craft beer chalk board with more than 30 listings rights off the bat. A few tables are scattered around the standing room and a few TVs line the ceiling. Come in for Happy Hour or a night cap, beware of game days it gets packed quickly. To the right, there is the dining room which is predominantly filled with tables, a second bar, TVs around the room and to the back of the restaurant portion there is a happy hour pit which is perfect for group setups.  The drinks - they have a full bar but the seller are their listings of craft beers. Sort these either by alcohol content, type or location. My favorite is the Sweet Baby Jesus [a peanut butter stout]. If you cannot decide, get a flight of 3 and snift your way through.  The food - come to the Yard for a couple reasons: Happy Hour specials, Grilled cheese menu or Brunch. There is a daily special on food, most notably the Juicy Lucy Special [cheese melted into the Burger] with a Beer for $10. Considering a Beer will run you around ~$6-8 dollars which is a steal. The 3 varieties of fries are separate but they are well worth it as well. [I love mine smothered in Parmesan]  There is a whole page dedicated to Grilled Cheese. that's right. The bread is additionally slathered in Butter so it's a decadence of amazing. Get this as a combo with Tomato Soup.  Brunch - Every Sunday come in for the Brunch special. The Yard has a special menu in place simply with brunch paired with a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. I personally do not like bloody Mary but I have heard great things.  To sum up - Great atmosphere, great Beers, good food. Come again, come often!",

The chips are flavorless, the tomato soup tastes like it's from a can, and the service is ridiculously slow. I have some friends that still love their burgers so I find myself still coming here once in awhile, but there are much better options. If you want a good draft list and good food, I would recommend Urban Tap.",

    "text": "TL;DR Don't go here (for now).  The good: The food.  Actually, it wasn't good, it was great!  I ordered the \"Not-Cho Grilled Cheese\" when I went there with a friend this past Saturday and my god it was amazing.   The bad: Several things, I'm afraid.    1) The service was pretty slow.  There seemed to be only a single waitress covering the area on a Saturday evening.    2) When we were served our food, we weren't given silverware or napkins.  While #1 can be explained by things outside the restaurant's control (people being out sick, etc.), unfortunately this is... a pretty big miss.  After waiting patiently for a few minutes (perhaps she had gone to fetch some...?) and seeing no sign of these items coming, I finally got up and grabbed 2 sets from an adjacent table just so I could eat my food.  3) The Internet.  This may sound a bit weird, but I am software engineer who works at an ISP, so this sort of thing is both very important to me, and very relevant to my work.  In order to use the wireless network there, you need to type in your Facebook password.  That's a little... creepy.  It's how phishing attacks happen.  Well, \"no problem\", I thought--I have two-factor auth enabled on my Facebook account, so even if my password is grabbed, my Facebook account is secure.  So I typed in my Facebook password, went into the Facebook app to create a login code, copied it to the clipboard, went to switch back, and... that actually doesn't work under the authentication dialog in the networking control panel on the latest version of Apple IOS.  Oops.  The \"authenticate via email option\" would also work... if there was cell reception available.  If there wasn't (as was the case with me), I can't check my email, now can I?  Yeah, I know #3 was a bit a long, but that point was a big frustration with me because when I am out of the office, the absolute last thing I want to do is troubleshoot somebody else's Internet setup which does not appear to have been tested in an actual production environment.  All that said, I do want to see this place succeed--the food was great, the server was nice to us, there were a great number of beer selections at the bar, and the atmosphere was nice.  The Yard Gastropub has a lot going for it, and if it can get over some of these rough edges, I'd be willing to give it a second try at some point in the future.",

Bottomless mimosas at brunch but I've gotta say - some of my friends were sucking these down very easily and were totally fine when we left...I don't think the champagne to OJ ratio is how it should be for $15. Definitely don't come here looking to save any calories - but if you're in the mood for a grilled cheese, this will do the trick. I do like the tomato soup that comes with the grilled cheeses. Brunch time seems to get pretty crowded here so it's probably worth a reservation if you know you're going ahead of time. Shadyside location has street parking and paid lots close by.",

    "text": "The Yard is one of those places that I really, really want to love...but unfortunately, it falls short for me.  The atmosphere is pretty much that of a typical pub. The restaurant itself is actually underground, which is interesting. I have a hard time with the lack of windows and wish it were a little brighter, but they do have free wifi which is nice! Be warned that it is extremely loud here - I always seem to find myself screaming in order to talk to my friends no matter what time I come.  One of the biggest aspects of The Yard's menu is the grilled cheese. They have dozens of different craft grilled cheeses with all different toppings. I am no stranger to the idea of craft grilled cheese - if you have not heard of MELT in the Cleveland area, you should look it up. It is absolutely phenomenal. Needless to say, MELT has given me extremely high expectations, so I came to The Yard expecting comparably amazing grilled cheese sandwiches. I regret to say that I was disappointed. I have tried The Big Che-bowski as well as the Smack Yo Mama. They're good, but not great. I always feel that the bread is a little hard and the flavors are not as distinct as I would like. I love the concept of getting a cup of tomato soup with your sandwich, but the tomato soup is oddly pasty, and almost everyone I have gone with has disliked it. Overall, the food is a bit of a miss for me.  Most recently, I came to The Yard for the bottomless mimosas deal on a Saturday afternoon. The Yard is one of the only bars in the burgh that seems to do the \"bottomless\" deal for brunch, and it's really a great bargain. The mimosas are clearly watered down, but at just $15, it's still worth it in my eyes. I have not been overly impressed with the service here - we actually had a waitress who seemed to be ignoring us at our last trip, and had to keep asking other waitresses for assistance when we needed something. Very strange.  Overall, I'm not rushing back to The Yard for dinner anytime soon. The bottomless mimosas are a great deal, and I recommend that on a weekend. Otherwise, there are much better options in Shadyside for dinner.",

    "text": "Popular place I heard of a while back. Been here two times now and I must say that their staff are very professional. They definitely want you to feel at home and welcome. If possible, I would recommend Mike to be your server.  A grilled cheese restaurant that supposedly mirrors or replicates the Melt in Cleveland, I gotta say that the atmosphere is very bar-esque (but it definitely adds to the Pittsburgh home-y feel). Located in the basement of the complex, you need to descend a flight of stairs all the while looking into the full glass restaurant front. Didn't look too hard but I'd assume not accessible friendly.   Tried Poppin My Collar (a shrimp type) and Simple Jack (no meats). The breads are more thickly cut (not my preference) but it definitely saves you from the meal being overly cheesy. My only issue would be that the bread is super oily but that's part of the grilled cheese experience I think. The sandwich itself isn't too big and its paired with a thicker tomato soup and a tin of fries (you get your pick on type from old bay to garlic Parmesan).  Went on a Wednesday which is their special for whiskeys and wines. They ask for how you'd like your drink made which is nice, but one issue I just remembered was that my drink made on the rocks was served without cocktail straws. Iced drinks are a choking hazards when had from the rim.   Overall though a great place I feel I can always come to for that comfort food! Would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Being a big fan of cheese (grilled or otherwise), I had been itching to try out this place devoted to this mighty sandwich. We went on a Saturday night around 9, and it was packed. I think we waited around 30 mins, which wasn't too bad.  We were seated in the main dining room and it was LOUD. I mean, it was a Saturday night and everything, so maybe I shouldn't be too harsh, but I don't love having to lean across the table to converse with my husband. They have a HUGE draft list, and we started off with a couple of beers. We were also pretty hungry, so we ordered the pub pretzels as an appetizer. These were standard issue pretzel sticks served with mustard and beer cheese dips. The pretzels were warm and soft with just the right amount of sauce, and the dips were tasty (especially the beer cheese), so no complaints there. For the grilled cheese, I got the Daniel Lafferty, which essentially has all of the components of a chicken parm (chicken, cheese, basil and marinara), while my husband got the Wang Chung Tonight (gouda, Asian slaw and pulled chicken). Each sandwich comes with a side of tomato soup and choice of fries (I got the garlic parm fries and my husband opted for sweet potato fries).  My grilled cheese was just okay. I mean, there was nothing particularly wrong with it, but there was nothing spectacular either. The sandwich was pretty small. They did use fresh mozzarella cheese, which was a nice touch. But for $12, I felt like it was overpriced and I could have made something just as good or better at home. The tomato soup that came with the grilled cheese was a bust. It was lukewarm, too thick, and had an off-putting smokey taste (but not a natural smoke flavor, the weird added fake kind). It was not appealing at all. Even the fries were lackluster...the garlic parm seasoning was delicious, but it seems as though I got the scraps of the fry batch, as many were short stubs. My husband did enjoy his grilled cheese. Unfortunately, his sweet potato fries came loaded with sugar and cinnamon...I wish they would note that on their menu, because neither of us is a fan of sweet potato fries served that way. So sadly, his fries went untouched.  On the dessert side of things, my husband noticed a s'mores donut dessert that he wanted to try (he is obsessed with donuts as a dessert food even though I insist they are to be strictly consumed for breakfast). So I begrudgingly agreed to get that for dessert. Well, it was literally just a glazed donut on a plate surrounded by some whipped cream and topped with marshmallow sauce, fudge, and graham crackers. That's it....a $ 0.50 donut fancied up with a few toppings and they charged $7 for it. Now those are some high food margins! Needless to say, the dessert was quite underwhelming (even my husband the donut fiend thought so), especially for such a high price.  Overall, I walked out of The Yard feeling like I had spent too much money for what I had received. Next time I might just walk over to the grocery store and get some bread and cheese and make my own dang sandwich.",

    "text": "I stopped by here not too long ago on a Thursday evening with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We had made reservations through opentable but as soon as we entered the dining room portion of the restaurant I could tell that was unnecessary.  The Yard is located on Bellefonte Street down a flight of stairs.  Upon entering the restaurant you are in the bar area with the dining room to the left.  After checking in the hostess led us to our table in the dining room.  The most distinctive feature that I remember of it was that it had a number of flat screen TV's which means that you had a view of at least one no matter where you were at.  The Yard has a pretty nice sized beer menu with a large number of craft beers.  So to start out the evening I went with the Sierra Nevada Narwhal which I hadn't seen before, or since for that matter.  Then for my entree I went with the Smack Yo Mama Grilled Cheese.  I mean how can you not go for a grilled cheese whenever you visit a place that has a grilled cheese section of the menu.  It consisted of BBQ pulled chicken, onion straws and beer cheese.  As you can imagine there's not much that you can dislike about that comfort food and it was pretty much as good as it sounds.  Then for my side I substituted in the Mac and cheese for the tomato soup.  It was also pretty good as the cheese sauce was tasty and the spiral pasta held it nicely.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The yard with its grilled cheese menu is almost the ultimate comfort food spot, now if that could only be good for my waist.",

I just really was very disappointed with the meal all together. I feel like it was a waste of money and I don't believe we will return or recommend this place. we also were placed under a TV and I smacked my head as we were leaving so that kind of capped off the night.   edit: the waitress was very good and attentive.",

    "text": "Wandered into The Yard last Sunday after a long bike ride.  My husband and I were starving! We were greeted by a really nice hostess who told us to pick a table.  We opted for the dining room over the bar and found a table against the wall.  A waitress came over very promptly and noticed we were perusing the tap list.  She told us to take a look and in the meantime would bring us waters.  I found this to be really nice instead of hovering over my shoulder while I selected my beer.  So far so good.  After we ordered our drinks they were brought to us very quickly and we ordered.  First, the menu is great.  The names of the grilled cheese sandwiches are from movies/tv/just funny which we appreciated.  I had the cheesy capresey and my husband had the big che-bowski.  Both sandwiches were fantastic and came with fries and really good tomato soup.  I truly appreciate their attention to quality, local food.  We will be back!",

    "text": "I heard of The Yard from a coworker who was impressed with their entire page of Grilled Cheese options on the menu. I was drawn in by the $15 unlimited mimosas. I stopped in for brunch on Sunday and was surprised to see the place had many available tables at 10:30AM. Shadyside was bustling about, parking was limited in the streets and in the Bellefonte/Ivy lots, but the Yard was surprisingly empty.  Let's start with the good -  The menu has lots of options. The brunch options are only one page long, but the rest of the menu was full of page after page of great options. My friend got Chicken and Waffles and said \"This was a great decision\" as she spread cinnamon butter onto her thick waffles. I ordered a chorizo scramble, which came out with a drizzle of sour cream on top. We both downed delicious Mimosas. Our waitress was attentive and always had the next mimosa on deck, ready for us before we had to ask. I am not sure if the entire menu is available during brunch hours - in hindsight, I wish the waitress would have made mention of that. But she was fabulous. She was friendly and attentive.   Now let's look at the not-so-good- Since the location is in the basement of a building, there is little-to-no cell reception. Not a deal breaker, but mildly annoying. Also, the small space is very echoy. There were two rather loud groups - One was a large group of girls, half of whom were still wearing clothes from the night before, the others looking like they had just rolled out of bed. ALL of them were loud and annoying. The other loud group was directly behind us, and we could hear every word to every conversation they had...which was especially annoying because they were rude to the waitress and complaining about everything. I think that most of this could be corrected by addressing the acoustics in the dining area. Maybe something to absorb the sound? It was just a little too harsh and echoy for a relaxing brunch. Now, much of this was because of the obnoxious people, but it could have been made less severe by the design of the room.   The cell reception and the acoustics are the only things standing in the way of 5 stars. I am looking forward to returning and trying one of those grilled cheese sandwiches! They have great, creative names, and they all sound delicious!",

They have many french fry options, different kinds like sweet potato, and seasonings like old bay and garlic parm. We were surprised at how much food we got for $10-12 a meal. I was disappointed however in the make your own bloody mary bar. I love bloody marys and was excited to hear about this bar from the waitress. The bar ran out of some items and it was slow to be restocked. I also felt that the glass with vodka that's given to you by the waitress was pretty watered down. When we got our check and I saw that it cost $18 for the bloody mary bar I couldn't believe it. I definitely didn't feel like I got my money's worth.",

Hubby ordered a Dogfish Beer, and thought it was excellent. I had an angry Palmer, and just tasted sugar, could not taste/feel any alcohol. For $9, I expect more!! We decided to share the poutine, which we devoured, but I thought the stout gravy was a bit too strong--hubby loved this dish. He also got the Juicy Lucy burger--loved this too, it did look amazing.  I has the lettuce wraps, meh--I've had better. Too much sauce on top, not enough crunch factor.  I would not order it again.  The place also smelled like a sewer, which I can understand because it is in a basement!!   :-/",

    "text": "Went to The Yard on a Friday night with a group of six without reservations. There was not a hostess at the hostess stand so we walked to the dining room and stood at the bar until a hostess cleaned off a table. Not a big deal, if we wanted a smoother seating we should have called ahead. We had a great waiter who was knowledgable and accommodating, but our first round of drinks took about 15 minutes to get to the table.   Now to the food. I was super excited about the menu. Everything looked great, especially the extensive grilled cheese menu. I decided on the Asian Lettuce Wraps with Thai Chili Chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Juicy Lucy Burger. We both found ourselves very disappointed with our meals. First, I ordered chicken for my lettuce wraps and had a terribly difficult time finding and actual piece of chicken. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was good but the entire wrap was a bunch of watercress with possibly some shredded chicken here and there. Unfortunately for me, I'm not a big fan of watercress. Next, my boyfriends Juicy Lucy burger, which is supposed to contain cheddar cheese cooked between beef, seriously lacked any cheese at all. I've never been anywhere where someone ordered a Juicy Lucy and I was anticipating a bunch of gooey cheese spilling out of the burger like you see on the travel shows, but there was none of that here. Otherwise, he said the burger itself was good, just missed the mark. Our friend enjoyed their food, including the Jerk Grilled Cheese and a flatbread pizza.   Perhaps since The Yard specializes in grilled cheese, that's what we'll have to go for next time.  This time though, The Yard was a couple yards short of a touchdown.",

We had poutine fries and wings for appetizers. Everything we ate was bad. The burger says well done in the menu. It was raw. Not rare. Raw. The wings were soggy and tasted like liver. The poutine fries had no cheese curds, meaning they were not poutine fries. They were just fries with gravy. And not good gravy. The grilled cheese came with tomato soup which tasted like BBQ sauce and served luke warm. The grilled cheese sandwiches were served on bland Texas toast and were mediocre at best. Additionally, plates would be nice. They serve the sandwiches on cutting boards and we all ended up with crumbs all over us. The sweet potato fries were soggy and luke warm - although to be fair, this is True most places. Sweet potato fries are usually this way. The steak sandwich was disgusting. No seasoning. 10% steak, 90% bread. Two star rating only because the staff was cool and they have good beer on tap. Avoid eating here.",

    "text": "Stopped in here on a moderately busy Monday evening. My friend and I stood around for about two or three minutes, awkwardly close to the table closest to the front door, waiting to be seated. Finally, a guy in shorts and an Under Armour shirt seated us in the dining area.   Priding itself on its beer selection, The Yard has a sizable list to choose from. However, the format looks like an Excel spreadsheet transposed onto a menu. If The Yard is going to stake its name as beer-loving gastropub, and it certainly seems that way, I want to know more about the beers they offer. The Monday night special was 16oz. local crafts for $4. I went with Full Pint's \"Night of the Living Stout.\" I'm a malty, dark beer guy and was immediately turned off by the rather intense hops flavor not present in most porters and stouts. Had I known this is how the beer tasted ahead of time, I wouldn't have ordered it. I'll take some blame for not sampling it, though. It could be the beer itself, or the way it was poured/drafted, but there was no head on it by time it came to the table and it tasted somewhat flat. I returned the beer, something I hardly ever do.  I had the roasted turkey sandwich, described on their menu as thus: fresh thyme baked turkey breast/thick carved/lettuce/tomato/onion/lemon aioli/artisan roll. Pros included the bread and the amount of meat. However, the turkey breast, admittedly a tough protein to keep from drying out, was just that, causing a dryness in each bite. The lemon aioli hardly showed up, and when it dripped onto my wax paper-covered cutting board below, it was watery. The red onion was the strongest flavor to come through, which, I don't think was the intention of whomever created this dish. The fries, many of which resembled the shape of an apostrophe, were slightly crispy on the outside, soft in the center and slightly on the greasy side for my taste. My dish, ultimately, was forgettable, rather than memorably bad. My friend, who ordered the seafood mac'n'cheese, said it was \"alright\" and that she wished the crab throughout wasn't so finely divvied up throughout the dish.   The service was subpar in my opinion. The servers seemed to be hard at work and always on the go, but perhaps too much so. Maybe they were understaffed. Awkwardly standing around to be greeted and seated didn't make a great first impression on me and the meals were served without silverware. When our server stopped to ask us if everything was satisfactory around mid-meal, I got a \"yeah...\" out before he was onto the next table. When check time came, he failed to ask if my friend and I were splitting the bill, which we were. Fortunately, I had cash to pay her.  I'm normally not so critical of restaurants. I'm not a food snob and having worked for a time in the industry, know that working in a restaurant isn't the easiest job out there. I'd much rather write positive reviews and don't go out of my way to write negative ones. The dining room, hardly separated from the pub area, was a bit loud for carrying on a conversation and catching up with my friend. Bottom line: the food and service needs to improve. I would come here again to drink, but until it's evident the food gets better, I wouldn't eat here. I think this place has potential, but with a lot of options in Shadyside, The Yard needs to improve quickly.",

    "text": "My friends and I were EXTREMELY disappointed with The Yard.  First of all, we were seated at a table in some dark corner where we couldn't really see. It was so dark, in fact, that we were forced to use our cell phone flashlights in order to be able to read the menu (to put it into perspective, I have 20/20 vision, but still couldn't read it). Anyway, for me, I ordered the lettuce wrap with shrimp, but was served the lettuce wrap with chicken instead.  I considered telling the waitress, but figured that it wasn't a big deal and that I'd eat it anyway since I didn't want it to go to waste.  BIG mistake.  I normally wouldn't have thought that shredded chicken could go all that wrong, but for whatever reason the chicken was REALLY chewy and tough, so much so that it was hard to even eat.  Normally, I'm not one to not finish my meal, but after a certain point even I couldn't eat it.  My friend, who ordered a different dish with pulled chicken, thought the same exact thing.  In addition, another friend ordered the spinach dip (also something that I didn't think could be easily messed up), but we were all extremely disappointed by that too (we all thought it was really bland and too cream cheesy...where was spinach?).  Everyone was also disappointed with the tomato gazpacho, which the group unanimously agreed tasted like cold tomato sauce.  Originally, when we were looking at the menu, we thought that the dessert looked really good, but after a disappointing meal we didn't even bother with that.  Plus, at one point they ended up bringing over a Caesar salad to our table which no one had ordered, and only after we went out of our way to ask about it did they realize that they had delivered it to the wrong table.  Overall, mediocre service, bad table, bad food...not impressed, and I'm rather shocked that it has as many stars as it does.",

He's not anyone that I would ever put in charge of customer service/relations.  My friend had a question about her bill.  She didn't want a charge dropped, she just wanted it explained.  In the most condescending way, Wayne explained the charge and how every restaurant charges that way and how she basically needs to to know why he's right.    Go for the food.  Stay for the atmosphere.  Leave because of Wayne.",

    "text": "Went there for a Sunday brunch.  We got seated immediately, and the waitress came over within five minutes.  It was 11:55 and half of the dining room was empty.  Prior to ordering food, I ordered the Bloody Mary bar which was $18 for unlimited Bloody Marys  between 10-1 (on-line menu indicated $24)  Twenty minutes later I still did not get my drink even though the waitress apologized three times for it not yet being ready.  I mean, how long does it take to fill a glass with ice and vodka!  It finally came and I went to the Bloody Mary bar to finish off my drink.  The self-make bar was underwhelming. It contained four containers of tomato juice ranging from mild, medium, diablo and beware; only two hot sauces, celery sticks, lemon wedges and olives.  They also had bacon strips as garnish which was surprising different, however, they did not have any toothpicks or other utensils to pick these items out od their serving dishes.  I consumed my drink within 5 minutes and patiently waited for a refill on the vodka.  The waitress passed our table at least four times over the next twenty minutes looking at the empty glass but not offering a refill.  Finally, I just asked her to change the order from the unlimited bar to the one time drink.  We ordered our food off of the brunch menu and also ordered a flatbread appetizer.  FYI, flatbreads are only $5 Sunday afternoons.  The food came rather quickly.  The breakfast scramble was huge and was tasty.  The order of Johnny cakes was also tasty but did not come with the noted maple syrup drizzle or the sweet buttercream.  Had to ask for syrup as well as  silverware. The bill noted that it was an ala carte order which was not what I requested.  The flatbread was also good but came at the same time as the rest of our meals.  Bottom line, food was good, service not so much. Will go back again to see if it was  just a fluke.  The menu is varied and eclectic and I would like to try a majority of the items on it, but if service does not improve, not going to do so.",

I wouldn't have even ordered anything other than a beer had we not seen the sign downstairs that said 'grilled cheese night: 1/2 off grilled cheese 7-10'.    both my boyfriend and I were disappointed in the food.  the cheese was even melty when it got to us and the bread was greasy.  Sandwiches weren't even hot, which is the whole point of grilled cheese.  Seasoned chips were ok but they weren't really seasoned evenly.  It seemed like they dumped all the old bay seasoning on the top of the chips.  Turns out when we got the bill that everything was full price and the waitress said that the 'grilled cheese night' is Monday only.  Wish they would have taken the sign down by Wednesday night when we were there.    We won't be eating there again.",

Ugh. When I finished my meal I realized it should have come with homefries. When I told him I didn't get them his response was, \"why didn't you bring it to my attention earlier\". Rude. If you don't like people, get out of the service industry. There is nothing worse than a server or bartender who only sees me as a tip.",

They really think out of the box! Plus their endless lists of beers on tap to wash it all down. Each of their grilled cheeses is paired with a choice of seasoned fries and a small cup of tomato soup. This part was my favorite. Their soup has a hint of smoky flavor to it that sets it far apart from the Campbell's that most grew up having with their sandwich.

In these two hours, the waitress never apologized, refilled coffee or even acknowledged the fact that we had been sitting there without food for a ridiculous amount of time.

That doesn't sound like anything special, but these aren't your normal grilled cheese sandwiches. Instead they are filled with things such as crab cakes.   That's not all they have though, as the menu is filled with a lot of different things that I want to head back to try. And the menu is done very well with an excellent sense of humor- I had really wanted to try the \"because I got high\" dessert, but I filled up on my entree and will have to get that next time.  The other thing that's different about this place is its downstairs in its building and walking down there into the front door hostess stand/bar gives you the feeling as though you are headed to some underground basement.

I ordered the French toast and it was okay, very thick and super sugary. It was definitely brunch appropriate. Behind us was a Bloody Mary bar but I only saw it used once. Guess it wasn't a popular draw.  I wasn't overly thrilled with my brunch experience there and I felt indifferent. I'd like to go back for dinner and see how I feel about those items.   While there were families eating there with a wide age range of children, the atmosphere was \"bro-y\" to me.  That might not be a negative, just stating what I observed. Also seemed like a dark place you'd want to head to after waking up with a hangover.   Overall: Kind of loud, super dark - not the best brunch atmosphere, but worth a shot to try for dinner and drinks.",

There was a Steeler's game so the place was packed, but we still were seated right away.  I ended up with the Mac Attack ($12).  This was a grilled cheese on Texas toast with mac and cheese in-between.  The Texas toast and the cheese weren't anything special.  On the other hand, the mac and cheese was spectacular.  It was loaded on the grilled cheese, and I would recommend getting a side of mac and cheese if you come here.  This is some of my favorite mac and cheese in Pittsburgh!  Each grilled cheese comes with tomato soup and fries.  The tomato soup went untouched between my friend and I.  It tasted like marinara sauce.  It was good to dip your grilled cheese in, but it was too much alone.  As I don't really eat fries, I was surprised to enjoy the ones here.  They have plenty of specialty options, with NO up-charge, and I liked the garlic parmesan fries.  My only complaint was that our waitress was slightly over-attentive.  She was over three times in five minutes pressuring us to order.  At 9:30 PM, there were still some tables left so it was just a touch off-putting.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed my evening here.  They have lots of daily specials!",

We originally came for the house dessert, but were pleasantly surprised by our grilled cheese sandwiches too. The mac n cheese would have been better with a bit more flavor, it was kind of bland. The dessert was absolutely the best part of the meal, it's a sandwich stuffed with Nutella, peanut butter and banana and then deep fried in a batter that tastes like funnel cake. Then it's smothered with marshmallow fluff and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I was blown away by the size and the flavor. It seems like a trendy place and I can imagine it would get quite busy during prime time. The service was really great too!",

The sandwich itself lived up to the hype. It was delicious and my egg was nice and runny just how I asked for it. The tomato soup was typical tomato soup, good but nothing life changing. The mac and cheese was underwhelming-it was kind of bland.  I would go again but I would get different sides. There is a huge selection of sandwiches and sides to choose from, its tough for an indecisive person. Overall I had a good experience.",

The overall appearance and layout of the restaurant was ok, music was good, and my waiter was really nice....thats about as good as it gets. I got the staple mac & cheese grilled cheese sandwich with fries and the tomato soup. The food came out in a timely manner however it just was not what I expected. Most photos from The Yard the food looks amazing...my food however did not. My bread was so hard and inside of my sandwich (mac and cheese) was luke warm, French fries were greasy with absolutely no seasoning on them, and the tomato soup was meh. But I ate it anyway because I was starving ! An hour later my friend and I are both extremely nauseated and begin vomiting.....there goes our night SMH! What a coincidence we eat that food and an hour later we are both hugging the toilet. Because of that The Yard gets one star & won't be getting my business again!!",

This restaurant is tucked behind Walnut street and is pretty easy to overlook. However, make sure to check this place out next time you're on Walnut street- it's worth the visit!  Living about a five minute walk from the Yard, I have been there several times and every single time I have been impressed by their service and food. One of the things I love about the Yard is that they have a wonderful beer list with a lot of variety. I always love trying out beers I've never had before and the Yard is a wonderful place to expand your beer palette.  My most recent visit to the Yard, I ordered the Mac Attack grilled cheese with garlic fries and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was served very generously with more than enough mac and cheese to fill up on, which made for a messy (yet delicious!) meal. The fries were also great as well. The only item that I wasn't too crazy about was the tomato soup, which had almost an acidic taste to it. All in all, I always enjoy visiting the Yard and always leave satisfied with a food coma!",

More and more people joined us, and our final group was about eight.  It was a bit tight, but they were willing to make it work.  That said, I would still recommend making reservations so you can get a table in the dining area and you won't need to worry about huddling around a small table.    Their beer list is fairly lengthy.  Unfortunately it seemed like they were out of everyone in our group's first choice of beer.  When ordering drinks it's definitely worth having a back up ready just in case they're running low again.  As far as food you have to with one of their many grilled cheese options.  I got the Mac Attack, a grilled cheese sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  It was delicious, cheesy goodness (with way too many carbs).  It came with fires and some tomato soup.  They go well with the sandwich, although I can't recommend dipping a Mac Attack into your soup.  It will probably not hold up.  The wait staff was friendly and willing to accommodate our group as more people showed up than expected.  They were willing to work with us and tried to find us a bigger table, even while dealing with reservations.  That was nice, even if it didn't work out for us.  All in all, it's a great place to go with friends after work.  I'll keep it in mind for the next time we decide to do a post-work happy hour.",

They sat us in this weird dark corner, probably because they were (to my surprise since it was a Monday) quite busy.  They seemed to have a nice beer selection, although I can't comment on them much since I got a cider.  For appetizers we got pretzels and the poutine. The pretzels were your typical type and the poutine had melted cheese instead of cheese curds and was super heavy but tasty.  For my sandwich I got the Wang Chung Tonight on recommendation from our waiter. It was DELICIOUS. I had the biggest smile on my face after trying it. The sandwich itself was huge with buttery bread. It was paired with the parm herb fries which were also very flavorful and tasty. I wasn't the biggest fan of the tomato soup - too salty for me and had some chunks in it.  The Breakfast Club and the Big Chewbowski were hits with my dinner mates. We also tried a side of mac and cheese that was super cheesy and super yummy.  Would def come back here again, they have specials almost every night and for the amount of food with the Monday special it was extremely affordable. Eight of us ate for about $120 (including drinks).",

My friends and I decided to grab a drink and dinner after work.  After seeing the \"Gobbler\" on The Yard's Facebook page, we knew it was time to visit.  While I waited for everyone to arrive, I ordered their hot pretzels.  Oh my gosh were they hot and tasty!  They came with a honey mustard and a spicy mustard - both were delicious.  The pretzels paired with my craft beer nicely!  For my main course, I selected the Big Che-bowski - Cheddar / Smokin Rodeo Gouda / Thick Applewood Smoked Bacon / Fried Egg / Tomato.

Accompanied by sweet potato fries, I left saying \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing...\"    There are many other cheesy dishes I want to try: TURKEY CRISTO = Swiss / Tussy Mountain Cheese / Oven Roasted Turkey / Berry Preserves / Deep Fried,  or WANG CHUNG TONIGHT = Smokin Rodeo Gouda / Pan Fried Chicken / Asian Slaw / Sweet Thai Chili Sauce, or basically anything on their menu.

    "text": "In a hunt for someplace casual to grab a bite to eat and hang out on a Friday night, we discovered The Yard. Overall, I would say it offers reasonably priced, Pittsburgh-esqe food but with a bit more flair. People coming here should expect a cozy ambience and comfort food best served on a cold winter evening.   Ambience: The restaurant is located, more or less, in the basement of a building just off of Walnut. The large chalkboards covered with specials and beers on tap along with incandescent lighting make it an approachable place. The only downside I imagine is during the day, where being below street level offers little lighting. On a Friday evening, the place was busy- great for a group of friends, less so for a romantic date.  Food: I went for one of their grilled cheeses (Smack Yo Mama) and was by no means disappointed. The Texas toast was thick cut and butter generously. The cheese oozed out. As I said before, this place offers meals for the gluttonous not healthy. I was a big fan of the sweet potato fries (although a bit more seasoning or salt would have been nice) and the side of cinnamon butter (or cream?) was perfect. The tomato soup on the side was an added bonus. Overall I was pleased as were my friends, but again, expect to feel the impending coma. And of course, the added flair of the food led to a slightly higher price than you would expect from a grilled cheese ($11-14), although after eating it, I wouldn't complain.   Drinks: Like many establishments, The Yard offered a wide selection of beers including some fantastic stouts. I would say the selection was above average but pricing a bit on the high side for Pittsburgh. Somewhere around $6-8/beer unless you went for the less appealing domestics.   Service: A bit slow on a busy Friday night and things were crammed by the bar. But once we were seated, we had quick and friendly service. The waiter offered his recommendations which were spot on.",

After watching Andy Warhol eat a hamburger at the museum and purchasing 5 new aprons from Williams and Sonoma (new year, new me!), it was safe to say that I had worked up quite an appetite. The lemon water that our server brought out was delicious and very flavorful. I had to watch myself, almost filled up on water.I chose a philly cheese type of grilled cheese..did I mention they have 28 different types? The philly cheese was just what the doctor ordered to combat my hunger, in addition to the succulent soup and zesty Cajun fries. This place is a gem and I plan on returning to Pittsburgh all of February and sample all 28 in 28 days. Easy 5 stars plus I'll give them 5 slices of cheese making this my favorite place of all time! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The rest of the menu is pretty fancy and they have some great food but the lovely chocolate and marshmallow goodness of the s'mores fondue just filled my food-loving soul. Also a great selection of beers on tap; I've enjoyed all the stouts I have tried - personal favorite would be \"Sweet Baby Jesus\" a peanut butter and chocolate stout, which can do no wrong.   Trivia night has a great atmosphere! The hosts are enthusiastic and welcoming and do a good job of keeping the crowd happy and entertained.",

    "text": "When I heard about these gourmet grilled cheese, I HAD to try The Yard! I think my expectations were a bit too high, which is why they fell short a bit.   I was overwhelmed with the menu at first, but ended up going with what I came to get - The Mac Attack. When I saw it had bacon, I had to have it. I didn't know what \"lardons\" were, so I asked our server and he replied \"little pieces of bacon\". Sold. I ordered that with crispy fries and a $3 glass of wine, nice. The rest of the table ordered and one of our friends also got the Mac Attack (another bacon lover!).   It didn't take too long to come out and when it did I was so excited to try! I took my first bite and my taste buds were overly happy, but then slightly disappointed - no bacon. I asked the server if they forgot to put it in and he said \"no, it's cooked in bacon, but there isn't actually bacon\". What? Fifteen minutes ago you told me there were small pieces of bacon. Both my friend and I were extremely disappointed. Sans bacon, it was still delicious. This was a perfect grilled cheese to dip into the tomato soup. The fries however, eh. They are described as crispy, however mine were mostly made up of huge chunks of potatoes, so they weren't at all crispy.   Dessert - huge disappointment. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert and it just didn't do it for me at all. Maybe it was the white chocolate. S'mores fondue was bland and the graham crackers were stale.   Prices aren't bad at all for the amount of food you get. I didn't mind the restaurant being in the basement and didn't feel it took away from anything.   All in all, I still really enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely go back - way too many grilled cheeses to try!",

Bartender was very nice and the guy next to me actually chatted, which is good for Shadyside.  Ordered the pierogis and kielbasa and it was AWESOME.  It came with kraut and grilled onions.

Try the sciracha ranch and dip your sandwich or chips In it.   I have also had the fattoush salad. This is a full salad at $11 with a very good lemony men dressing and general Middle Eastern flavors. It's a decent size. At the servers recommendation I got balsamic dressing on the side salad and although The dressing looked distressingly thick in its little cup, The flavor was very good. Others at my table got the cheesy caprese grilled cheese and we're happy with it, although one of them thought the sandwich needed more basil. The atmosphere Of the Shadyside location is kind of fun/warehous-y.  The diners were a welcome mix of all young and many races. I have always had good service here and find them to be quite flexible in accommodating requests.   One thing I would not recommend this restaurant for is people who have trouble hearing. The restaurant is quite noisy.  Otherwise if you're up for some tasty decadent food, this is probably your place",

We've been twice now with out of town guests and our newborn, and besides accidentally spilling tomato soup on myself (klutz) have really enjoyed ourselves. I've gotten The Simple Jack and can't wait to try more of their grilled cheese options. The Mac Attack was also enjoyed by everyone at our table as a shared appetizer. One slight critique is that the tomato soups has a kind of smokey after taste, that's just not up my alley. It's perfectly fine for dipping sandwiches and fries, but eating it on it's own, not so much.",

My boyfriend got the Hail Caesar chicken sandwich and he agreed that the chicken looked a little \"funny\".   I'm curious about their grilled cheeses, so maybe I'll try it again.

Bottomless Bloody Marys were$18 so my table and I opted out.   I had the frittata. It was okay but lacking a lot of seasoning. It is billed as having caramelized onions, basil, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese. I assumed it would all be in the frittata. It was all just thrown on top. The home fries were standard cubed potatoes you could find anywhere.   My other friends at the breakfast burrito and the chorizo scramble. They were happy with their meals but the home fries were mediocre.   What really saved the meal was the waitress, Kara. She knew what we needed before we even realized it. Never pushy but very helpful. Do be forewarned that the place is very, very, very loud and the tables against the wall are very tight. Opt for a table by the booths for additional space. Brunch was just okay.",

She then says  she'll check...oh boy I'm so grateful she decided to do her job. She said, about 25min. I said ok, put us down. They take down your number and text you once ready.

The menu was vast as well, and I liked how all grilled cheese came with a side of their tomato soup which was excellent. All grilled cheese also comes with a side of home made potato chips, but you can sub for another side, such as flavored French fries as I did. I got the Parmesan garlic fries, and could have done without the powdered flavoring, but the rest of the meal was so good I didn't mind. I got the Mac Attack sandwich-grilled cheese stuffed with creamy Mac and cheese and it was one of the best sandwiches I ever had. I wish we weren't so full so that I could have tried their dessert! Our waitress was very friendly and conversational.   I can't wait to come back when I visit Pitt again!",

However, last time there had the worst service I think I've ever experienced...anywhere.  First, waited for 25 minutes at the bar before I even got a water. There was also a mess - an old half eaten Mac and cheese, some drinks and someone's check sat there with me the whole time. Then put my name in for a table, and waited another 20 min while I watched four tables sit empty and the hosts chatted with their friends. When I finally asked if I could sit at one of the open tables, they said they had tried texting me it was ready but they had bad service (I was sitting 5 feet from the host stand).  After finally getting to a table and waiting another few minutes without anyone approaching me to take an order, and having so far spent 45 minutes to get a water, I finally left to get some food across the street.   So, unfortunately I won't be coming back, because as much as I did like the food here, it only tastes good if you ever actually get it.",

With the recommendation of my friends (which I now also encourage), I substituted my side of homemade potato chips for sweet potato fries (at an extra cost) and they were delicious as well. They don't skimp on anything and although the price can be a little steep; I would say that the food is definitely worth it. The rest of my group got the \"Mac Attack\" grilled cheese and they loved it! I would definitely come here again.",

I've been twice in the past week and each time it's taken about 35-50 minutes to receive food after ordering. After the first time, I assumed they were having a rough day, but on the 2nd time, I realized it's because their kitchen is swamped by Uber eats or Grubhub orders and can't turn out food for the restaurant.   We were also seated on the bar side for one of the meals and while the bartender was nice, she was left to cover the entire side by herself. At one point 3 servers and the hostess were joking around at the bar, while we were unsuccessfully trying to get our check.   Sadly, I don't expect we'll be back.",

    "text": "As a lover of grilled cheese, I knew I would find my home here. Originally a vegetarian, I tested their veg options and always enjoyed what I had. Now a meat eater, I've been getting their \"The Big Che-Bowski\", and it does not disappoint. They do not skimp on bacon, and they definitely don't skimp on cheese. Every sandwich is loaded and delicious, especially with the edition of the Texas toast. We have always had great experiences here, with only minor complaints (a friend ordered onion rings last weekend and the insides of a few were still mushy batter) but overall, a great place, and a great atmosphere.   We ordered it to go via grubhub last night. Usually we call, but it went straight to a voicemail every time I tried to call, so I went online and hoped they would get our orders right--I'm always afraid that if I say I don't want something in the \"special comments\" section, it might be ignored. Our food was all correct. The tomato soup was dished into the container just before I took it home, and was still nice and warm. Our only complaint was that the Texas toast was a bit too hard, and not in a \"crispy\" way. We noticed this last weekend, as well. But by the end of our meals, we were full and happy and ready to binge Netflix on the couch!",

I don't need much attention...but also don't like sitting at the bar trying to get the bartenders attention when there are 2 people there.  Hell, it seems like even the table wait staff are frustrated with the bartenders.  I've seen a couple trying to order drinks....and eventually give up and walk away.   Wings are just Ok.   Brunch items (at least our two) are... sad, to say the least.  The Brun-Cho's Bro is essentially a bowl of tater tots with some cheese and canned jalapenos.  Mimosas are pretty weak.    Dear owners:.

(It's amazing how important those first few minutes are to set the tone for the whole evening.) The atmosphere was a little dark and loud. Not a to of personality. Then we got to the food. We ordered Poutine for an appetizer. I am not sure how they make their fries, but they are delicious. Think Steak Fry mates with Curly Fry. The Stout Gravy was perfectly seasoned and left you with a touch of pepper taste. They used a cheese sauce instead of actual curds which was a little disappointing, but the rest of the dish made up for it. Muffin and I decided to split 2 sandwiches since everything sounded so good. The Jerk did a great job of balancing all of the different flavors (Jerk Pork, Peach Chutney, Slaw) though now looking at the menu, I seemed to have missed the plantains. I had the Young Cheezy. The Chorizo was tasty and not too greasy. I think I could have done without the Hash, the texture kind of screwed up an otherwise great sandwich. Both plates came with more of those spectacular fries and a small bowl of Tomato Soup (The tomato soup, with it's hint of basil left me wondering how they got it to taste like the essence of summertime beefsteak tomatoes.) Killer pronounced his Mac Attack as yummy. High praise indeed from him. He even made a solid attempt to eat it all. Finally, against my better judgement we ordered \"Cause We Got High\" as dessert. We were all full, but how do you pass up a Peanut Butter, Banana, Nutella Sandwich that is deep-fried and covered with Toasted Marshmallow Fluff? When it came to the table, I suddenly understood why gluttony is a sin. You could feel how wrong it was to eat this down to your bones. That didn't stop us from devouring it all however.  All in all, the food was awesome and the service had a few kinks, that a little more direction and focus should be able to iron out.",

One of my friends kept posting about this restaurant and their bottomless mimosas on Saturday and Sunday.  The mimosas are from 10am to 1pm for $15 and it's definitely worth it.  The food is cooked beautifully.  I went there with family today and watched some football.  The owner did something extremely nice and I'll definitely be back because of the excellent customer service that was displayed! I would recommend for others to try it out.",

The wine was good, the whiskey pore was so small that I thought they gave me somebody's glass that had already drank from it ($9.50) the wine was $11.00 a glass, I bought a bottle today at the wine store for $9.99.   The food came, I had the Wang Chung grilled cheese but it had no cheese, the fries came in a little bucket that made they mushy. My wife's sandwich was better but not a gourmet grill cheese.   Will not waist my money or time here again. YUCK!",

    "text": "I came to the Yard on a Friday night with a fairly large party. We called ahead to make reservations, and the staff was very accomodating when I changed the number of people the day of. The dining area is small, so I recommend reservations for large parties. We arrived a little early expecting to sit at the bar for a bit, but our table was all set up.  The interior is brand new and looks really nice. I barely noticed that the restaurant is in the basement and doesn't have much natural light.  Now, on to the most important part: the food. There is a rather extensive menu of grilled cheese. I had the Yinz Guys Hungry? which comes with steak, tomato, slaw, and cheese, but I ordered it without the slaw (born and raised in Pgh, yet I don't do slaw on sandwiches). All grilled cheese sandwiches come with a side of tomato soup and fries with your choice of seasoning. Delicious. Everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.  The menu also includes brunch, a burger or two, etc. I don't drink beer, but they have a lot of it, as well as a mixed drink and dessert drink menu. I had the DJ Razzy something or other and it was also delicious.  My only gripe with the Yard is the noise level. It was crowded and the noise bounces off the walls. We had to practially shout to hear each other.  But other than that, I definitely recommend the Yard.",

We sat at the bar, there was plenty of room there at the time, although not before long it was getting pretty busy. Overall we had a pretty great experience!   The bartender was nice and helpful, she seemed busy but did a good job of continuing to check on us. (Didn't catch her name but she was the only one there at the time.) She knew a great deal about craft beers--we were a bit overwhelmed at first, this place has 30+ beers on tap, many that I had never heard of. She asked us what we like to drink, recommended a couple for us to try, and helped us find ones that we really liked! I was happy we could get some insight and to get to try something before committing. My friend (who knows even less than I about beer) was excited to have found two new beers she really liked!   We split some appetizers, had the pretzels which were a great portion, served hot with yummy dipping sauces. My friend got the crab soup, she wasn't thrilled with it, but with the other stuff we ordered we had plenty to eat anyhow. She did not realize it was so cheesy, as that wasn't indicated on the menu. We also had a flatbread pizza which was very good. The food took a while, but outside of the wait and the soup we were quite pleased with what we got.   My experience at The Yard was very pleasant. I can't speak to any of the more substantial meals or table service since we were at the bar, however, based on the hospitality, beer selection, and value/quality of what we ordered I am sure I will be back sometime soon!",

Me and two friends go there for brunch. First, we couldn't get Mimosa's where you could taste the chamagne. Next, the chorizo aka dog food. Two of us had it. I asked for new food. The manager, rather than just apologizing told us \"all taste buds are different\". They told me they took it off my check. I then get a check from the third waiter we had that day. I asked to see the manager again. The manager and owner came up. Rahter than apologizing for the bad experience, he lectured us on how its his best seller. Side note- the guests behind us had the chorizo and sent it back too. I don't appreciate being lectured when I am not happy with my food.",

    "text": "This was our second time here, and I am so glad I waited to form an opinion on this place. We were here for dinner on the 4th with our good friend Todd, and had a wonderful meal! The first time around it was kind of ho-hum, but I think it was more a matter if ambiance than food. See, the BF and I are not loud-bar-raucous-crowd types of people. We're more like to stare-lovingly-into-each-other's-eyes-while-sharing-one-drink-with-two-big-straws type of people. But the first time there, it was later in the evening, with the music pumping and lots of college aged people. So the morale is, if your old(ish) and boring choose when you go wisely, and you will have a lovely time! The first time I tried one of their grilled cheese and BF had a cheeseburger. Both were good, although I found the grilled bread kind of...sharp? I guess that's the right word. However the fries were really good and the homemade tomato soup is out of this world.  This time we started with the pub pretzels which I thought were going to be boring, but turned out pretty good.  I had a hamburger- the basic Yard burger, the BF had the Buffalo burger and Todd had the pulled pork sandwich. Everything was delicious! As I said, mine was basic but done well. Cooked well, juicy, on a great bun; a really good hamburger. Todd was pretty darn impressed with his BBQ, but, for me, the star of the show was the Buffalo burger. I never thought I'd like buffalo, but it was really, really good! I almost can't wait to go back so I can have one myself. The have a few style fries, regular, old bay and a couple others. All the fries are hand cut and very good. Although I'm a fry junky so.... Both times, the service was good. OBV, the service was unbelievable this time around, as we were one of like 4 tables in the whole place, but even the first time, when our waitress was running around like crazy, the service was good. Overall, I was very happy and can't wait to go back (for a super early, 5:30pm old person dinner, but, whatever!)",

The grilled cheeses are overrated.  They can be soggy and not worth the price tag.  The tomato soup is the strangest I've ever tasted and not in a good way.  I would prefer Campbells.  The burgers look good when presented but again have no flavor.  The nachos with beer cheese were almost inedible.Some of the other sandwiches are all bread.  The sweet potato fries are good but that's the extent of it.  The $25 I spent on two beers and a sandwich could have been better served somewhere else.",

The sandwiches are pretty expensive for something you could probably easily make yourself.  With that being said, if you do go here for food, be sure to go on a Monday for 1/2 off sandwiches from 7 to midnight and $4 pints. Also, I came here for some drinks with my friends for my birthday and my partner and I ordered a larger size quantity of beer to share. I don't remember how many ounces it was. I thought it would come in a large pitcher or something, but it came in a tall beer tower/tube looking thing (I cannot think of the actual word for this) and it was really hard to drink. It required a decent amount of concentration to not spill it when drinking, especially with the bubbles going on. Kids these days. Generally, I like my beer in a straightforward glass or pitcher of some kind.",

My friend and I were sat at a high top table in the bar area which was very nice in my option. The Yard is famous for their grilled cheese, so of course I felt obligated to order one. I ended up going with the Wang Chung Tonight, a grilled cheese made with Gouda, pulled BBQ chicken, and an Asian slaw. The sandwich was absolutely delicious! The barbecue sauce was sweet and tangy but not overpowering, all the sandwich ingredients definitely shined in their own way which was awesome. All grilled cheeses are served with a cup of their homemade tomato soup, which was delicious in my opinion. It was thick, creamy, and very flavorful. They also let you choose between four or five different types of French fries. I chose garlic parm fries while my friend had the sweet potato fries....both were very yummy. Although I didn't have a drink, they have an extensive beer list and next time I visit i definitely plan on trying out one of their IPAs! Would highly recommend!",

They have a great drink selection, a huge variety of options for lunch/dinner and a hip, casual atmosphere, but the food is just generic and has no taste. I got a house made chickpea basil burger that looked amazing but it was just tasteless and pastey. My boyfriend got a steak grilled cheese and said it tasted like nothing but butter and hot sauce. They have garlic Parm fries that they just drown in powdered cheese and dried parsley. This was my second attempt after being unimpressed with a tomato mozzarella grilled cheese. I feel like they could have grilled it longer because the inside of the sandwich was still cold and I would have liked the bread to be toasted more. It seems like they just let the sandwich sit on the grill for a few seconds.  The tomato soup is also subpar and tastes like Campbell's.  I go to a gastro pub expecting interesting food made in house and unfortunately this did not meet my standards.  I so terribly want to love this place but after the same experience with different food I will not be returning. I can effortlessly make a much better meal at home.",

    "text": "I like to only refer to this place as \"The Yard\", because \"Gastropub\" makes me cringe a little bit.   If you've ever wondered what it's like to grab everything from your kitchen cabinet and throw it on to your grilled cheese.... look no further.  But in this case, you don't have to go through the trials and tribulations of finding the best (and, let's be honest, the worst) combinations.   The Yard chefs have already hand-picked taste-bud friendly \"add-ons\" for everyone's palates.   You won't go home hungry: grilled cheese + soup + chips leaves you full and satisfied.   I'm a big fan of the old bay chips.   Don't miss the BOGO grilled cheese on Monday nights",

It has a nice spiciness too because of the jalapenos and pepper jack. Basic tomato soup, it's not very \"soupy\" but a little on the thicker side, still yummy though. My only complaint would be that my chips were a little too seasoned so it was too salty for my tastebuds. Oh right, we came for their half off grilled cheese on Mondays (7pm-1am), which made it even better. Food: 5/5 Service 4/5",

I noticed I couldn't make a reservation directly online, so I sent an email through their website. I was responded to within the hour by chuck, and he was so friendly and set us up with a reservation for that Saturday. Even when my reservation grew from 6 to 12, chuck was accommodating and friendly.   When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by mike (mark?). Mike was friendly and got us set up with our table immediately. He even went so far as to sit down with our group for a minute and say hello and ask if we were celebrating anything. He noted we were all new from Pittsburgh, and took the time to ask where each of us were from.   Our server, Courtney, handled or large group flawlessly. She was prompt and friendly. Probably 75% of us ordered the bottomless mimosas, and not one of our glasses ever fell beyond half empty. The food was amazing and the portions were huuuuggggeeeee for the price.   We were all incredibly pleased, and will definitely be back soon. Thank you chuck, mike, and Courtney for making our large group experience amazing!!",

Food : the unique thing about this restaurant is the amount of difference grilled cheese sandwich options they have! Anything you can think of is put on a grilled cheese! Our whole table got one. We got the Mac attack, los pollos Hermanos, frank the tank and smack your mama ( yes all great names). All were delicious. They said the Mac attack was their best seller which is a Mac and cheese grilled cheese. All were very good though! We also got Mac and cheese bites as an appetizer . 6 come in it with a tasty chipotle mayo sauce for dipping. Each grilled cheese came with tasty tomato soup and house made chips!  Environment: nothing special or unique specifically about this restaurant. However there was nothing bad.   Service: Service was exceptional!",

We chose The Yard because it was close to where we parked (and what we originally decided on was closed until 4) When we got inside they were busier than expected, I think the Bloody Mary bar was drawing everyone in! It was 11 am and the music was very loud, but it was nothing we couldn't tune out. We waited a while after we sat down before our waitress came over. She wasn't the friendliest but we just wanted a quick lunch so no huge deal. The waiter serving the next table was playing trivia with his table and it kept us entertained, as well.   He got: The Mike Byson Burger and chips. He enjoyed it but he asked for medium well and it came out still mooing? grunting? whatever Byson's do... however he still ate it and it filled him up.  I got: Holla Holla French Toast with Bananas. There were two huge pieces and it was good. Nothing spectacular but hey, french toast is french toast and it hit the spot.  Overall, it's probably no somewhere I would stop again, since there are so many other options in the area but the experience wasn't terrible either.",

The Mac Attack grilled cheese is like two meals in one! It's a grilled cheese which Mac and cheese on it! Every grilled cheese comes with house made chips and tomatoes soup. I like to substitute fries and dip them in the soup! It's so good! The tomato soup has a thicker consistency than others I've had and it tastes slightly of marinara, which I like.  The atmosphere is great! There are a bunch of big, clear TVs for sport watching. Also the bar and tables have a deep wood detail which gives the place a tavern look. It's clean! That's a plus!

Until about a year ago, there was no where in Shadyside that had more than 8 beers on tap. That has drastically changed since then. The place that reigns superior is now The Yard.  With at least 30 rotating seasonal taps, and many more on bottle, every beer lover will find something here to drink. They also pride themselves on their bourbon selections, which they also offer affordable flights of.   The nightly specials are tremendous, the bartenders friendly and engaging, and the kitchen is open late. No more S Aiken Pizza for me.   The food is GOOD. They specialize in Grilled Cheeses. May I recommend the afternoon delight, a turkey and Swiss grilled with a red pepper aioli. I add fresh jalapenos and bacon to it. It's not deli meat turkey either. It's carved turkey. The food here is fresh.  So come have a Yard at the Yard. You won't be disappointed.",

Had the marg pizza last week and the balsamic vinegar they drown it in just kills it with sweetness. The fattoush was not bad, but huge.  So shareable or wasteable.  The atmosphere....another walnut street college bar.  Forget having a conversation in the bar area on a weekend.  Cannot speak to the dining room.   So I say, if you have never been, and like beer, it's worth a try, but falls short in some crucial areas.",

Pros: Great staff (our waiter was fantastic...I think his name was Peter?), good location, a different vibe than other Shadyside bars, high quality ingredients, fantastic drink selection (something for everyone), chill atmosphere, vibrant crowd but not too loud, and every course had some great offerings (good appetizers like the soft pretzels, solid sandwiches almost universally, and the white chocolate creme brulee was a very enjoyable dessert).  Notes for improvement: (1) My chicken sandwich was great, but there wasn't enough cheese (it got lost under a large bun and in many bites I could barely detect it).  This is an easy fix: just use more cheese.  (2) The sweet potato fries were too salty, as if the kitchen didn't have enough confidence in their flavor.  Trust me, the flavor was great, and they don't need that much salt.  Side note: the sweet potato fries went great with the side of barbecue sauce my friend ordered, I would recommend the combo to any diner.  (3) One of my dining companion's burgers came out undercooked.  Pretty much every nearby restaurant will overcook your burger, so this was different, but if you want to be a top-tier gastropub you should cook burgers to temperature every time.  Use some trial and error to figure out a system, then stick to it religiously.  I look forward to dining here again, when hopefully I'll up the rating to 4 or even 5 stars.  It's definitely within reach of being a top-tier Pittsburgh gastropub.",

    "text": "Growing Pains Have Yet To Improve  We have gone here several times in the months that is has been open, and overall the experiences are usually the same, with the concneus being an overwhelming \"Meh.\"  The beer selection is great, the food can be good, but the staff has no sense of urgency, which can ruin the great idea of this concept.  Our last meal was a bust from the start, with the standard unattentive server.  Drinks took forever, and while we got $5 flights, there was limited explanation of which beer was which in the \"Build Your Own Flight.\"  At least, as a saving grace, we could figure it out, but that was a bit frustrating.  The food took much prodding to get from our server.  When it did arrive, only the sandwiches were hot.  The soup was both lukewarm and bland; as if they were attempting to pay homage to grilled cheese with condensed Campbell's soup from childhood.  My fries were also not hot, though we did have both items promptly replaced with a hotter version.  The final issue that left us sour was that with the second round of flights, they were out of the normal glassware to do them.  The bartender's solution was to use shot glasses, netting us a serving that was half size.  This was called out, and we did get an extra pint, but I am not sure why free glassware from Sam Adams is in such short supply in a beer based gastropub, especially when the flight glasses are free from a Sam Adams rep.  The entire experience reaffirmed that the only way to do The Yard is drinks only, and only at the bar rail.  You can at least get your beer on time then, other than that, it can sit at service bar for several minutes while the staff is nowhere to be found.   That's the shame of it all, the place has so much potential.  They just don't care to try.",

That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's not what I expected)  Dislikes: 1) Service was a little slow.. could take awhile to get a drink refill. 2) Tomato soup was pretty nasty to me.. had an odd sweet taste to it. 3) Most of all I disliked the very loud atmosphere. I'm not sure if this had to do with their acoustics as well, but it got difficult to even hear the person next to me after around 7-8 PM on a Thursday evening. Of course this may not be under their control and may not be their fault, but I probably won't be going back soon because of this. When I go out, I want to actually be able to easily converse with my group.",

She mentioned that we can wait at the bar and they were hoping to finish the party up and get us seated by 8:15p. No big deal, we headed to the bar. Had a few drinks and the pretzel app. Decent pretzel. Good signature drink options, loads of beer choices too.   We were seated at 8:45pm. I ordered the yard burger. Which was really good, I'd skip the fries. Someone else in my party ordered the keilbasa and pierogi supper, it was 'fine'. Someone else ordered Big Cho-Bowski, she really liked the sandwich, didn't care for soup and didn't eat the fries because it was too much food.   From what I saw everyone mainly orders the grilled cheese and I can appreciate that. The bread is thick cut and it is their thing. But if you don't feel like eating that, I'd vote yard burger everyday. It really was tasty.   Three stars because of the wait, which I know isn't in their control in, but we shouldn't have been able to book a reservation for a time they couldn't accommodate. We will go again.  I will update then.",

The best are (apparently were) the mussels - please put them back on the menu!  But wait...there's more!  Can you say 1/2 off grilled cheese sammies + $4 local pints 7pm-midnight?  There's an abundance of options for whatever mood you're in and a new flavor combo seems to appear on the menu w/ some regularity.  Chips come standard, but consider upgrading to fries and dip 'em in the smoked tomato soup.  One caveat, however...rock a base layer + parka because it's like dining in a walk-in freezer (and no, it's not the fans' fault)!",

Seriously it was over the top delicious. My boyfriend had the blarney stoner. This was open faced with mashed potatoes, beer cheese, stout gravy, fries, and hash. So really it was potatoes on bread. Not really grilled, but so yummy.  All of the grilled cheeses come with tomato soup and fries. The fries were thick and almost breaded, soft in the middle. You can get them in a few different flavors including old bay- can't go wrong there. The tomato soup was interesting. Not bad per se but really really thick. I can't imagine eating a bowl of it but it did serve the obvious purpose of being vessel for dipping.   Our service was great. She was quick and efficient. Absolutely no complaints. Also the beer list here is amazing. We will be back!",

I am not a big tomato soup person, but the soup that went along with the grilled cheese was quite good. I also ordered a side salad the first time we came for drinks and I got the ranch dressing. Honestly, their ranch tastes exactly like Hidden Valley ranch which was a let down. I love restaurant ranch because it is always so flavorful and thin, but that is not the case here. We came on a wine and whiskey night so that was a nice surprise we both got some high-end type whiskey for only $4. I have to say the two times I have been here I paid more than I really wanted and the food was just fine, but nothing to really pull me in to want to go back much.",

The Yard is a great date venue but also some where you can go alone, with a group, or with friends to watch the game.   I ordered the impossible burger-- the toppings were way better than the burger and I think that had something to do with the fact that it wasn't actually a burger. Next time I plan to get a real burger with the same toppings. The caramelized onions, mushrooms and garlic sauce all complemented the \"burger\" very well.   I think the fries sat out a little too long, they were a tiny bit cold. I didn't fault The Yard for this too much as it was pretty late (after 11pm) and they may have been shorter staffed.   The atmosphere is very relaxed, you could stay all day and not feel pressured to leave. I really liked this aspect about the Yard. The pricing is on point, food is great especially for late night and menu has something for everyone.",

At times it's loud and extremely busy but that's too be expected. Sometimes food is slow to come out but I'm not complaining. Their draft list is crazy and they have all of what's available, the size, the price, where it's from, etc in a book at your table. One happy hour was half off PA drafts. Another time it was half off every draft! Can't beat that.   Never been disappointed with their gourmet grilled cheeses. My favorite is Buffy the Mac attack slayer but I've tried probably around 5 and liked them all. Dessert was good too.  Went their during spring break at 5pm and there wasn't one person in the restaurant. Apparently their crowd is mainly college students but I loved eating in peace and quiet. Lol",

Their grilled cheeses (that's all i've ever gotten there, but the other good looks great) are always super tasty. It's always a touch decision which one to get. But this most recent time I noticed that the sandwich seemed smaller (even my girlfriend's did and she got \"The Jerk\" which is usually overstuffed!) and the complimentary soup had less of that warm, tomato soup happiness to it.  Also, what happened to the fries?  I still enjoyed them, but they were clearly a smaller portion and heated up pre-packaged fries that were a bit soggy.  The old fries at the Yard were perfectly fluffy and crispy, you got a fair amount, and you could pick your seasoning!  I'll be back, the specials are great, as is the food, but yea, the changes kinda irk me.",

With that being said it's a nice little place and a nice environment and not too expensive.",

    "text": "This was my second time to the Yard and I am still a major fan of it. It is a fun, hip place to go if you are in the mood for a grilled cheese. And let me tell you, these grilled cheeses are not your typical one that you probably had when you were growing up. These are gourmet and beautiful and delicious. I had the Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer. Ugh. Simply amazing. If you like Mac n Cheese AND buffalo chicken dip you just have to try this one out. Honestly so good!!   For an appetizer, I got the pub pretzels and those are equally as delicious. You only get four, so if you're sharing, just beware!   Unfortunately, the only \"bad\" thing about this restaurant is the wait time for food. The first time I went, I had to wait nearly an hour for my food to come out and today I had to wait about 30-35 minutes for it. Bit annoying when you're starving! But the food is good, so it's worth the wait!",

Eggs were over cooked and without seasoning.  I opted for the up charge of chorizo, there was maybe 1 oz of meat in it.  Not great by any measure.  There was tater tots in there also but super soggy, as though they were fried in lukewarm oil.  The homefries that came with it were of the same family.    I only have deep regret I wasted a meal here.",

The sandwiches are packed full leaving you satisfied with your order. They also come with chips and tomato soup. I always substitute the chips because I think they taste really bitter and kind of gross. The tomato soup is okay, not my favorite, but it tastes like marinara sauce.  The service can be a bit slow, but all of the employees are really friendly and nice, and come back to make sure everything is going well even after you get your food.  I'll admit I've never come here outside of the grilled cheese nights, but this place has always been awesome every time I've been here!",

I got The Yard Burger, it was cooked perfectly and had a lot of great flavors. The fries were just okay. Next time I go I'll have to try one of the grilled cheeses, apparently that's their specialty.

One of the hostesses tried to sit in the last open table in the bar, but we asked to sit in the dining room. She definitely seemed irritated, but I'm more comfortable at a low top table. Luckily, there was a table available.   They have a good selection of draft beers - I ordered a Arsenal Cider. I would definitely go back to drink there again.   To start, we ordered the pretzels (catching a theme here?) follow twistburgh on Instagram for more! The pretzels were just your standard pretzel sticks. I would order them again because none of the appetizers appealed to me.   For my entree, I ordered the caprese grilled cheese. If you know me - you know I don't like grilled cheese. This was the only sandwich that appealed to me. It came with a side of tomato soup and I ordered a side of Mac n cheese. The sandwich was okay - I would get it again - but I don't find the appeal of this restaurant.   The wait staff seemed to disorganized when bringing drinks and food to the right table.   I'm not making plans to go back there soon.",

So I decided to skip an app and get the Full Monte Cristo. This wonderful sandwich contains Swiss and American cheeses, roasted turkey, tavern ham, toasted bread (pretty sure it was texas toast), with a side of berry preserves. Oh my lord was the sandwich good. The berry preserves just set it all off. But it went downhill from there. I opted for onion rings which were under cooked but whatever. The worst part of this whole meal was the smoked tomato soup. I like my tomato soup to be tomatoy and it wasn't. Just tasted like smoked flavoring. Blah, no thank you.  The service was absolutely terrible though for the place only being somewhat busy. Took forever to get my food and refills and when I did see the waitress, she was very moody. No thank you.",

    "text": "I have been visiting The Yard for a few years so it's probably time I left a review. This location is the first The Yard location. The Yard is a good spot to grab happy hour drinks or snacks, dinner, or watch a game with friends. They have a good happy hour with specials from 5-7 on both food and drinks. In my opinion, The Yard is a crowd pleasing option - they have food that is delicious and nicely prepared that will suit adventurous, healthy, picky, or junk food preferences. Oh, and they have a huge selection of beer and other drinks.  All of the food I have ordered here has been tasty and the service timely and friendly. The best food is probably the creative grilled cheese sandwiches in my opinion. I like to substitute the chips for a side salad, and I appreciate that the side salads are very high quality with nice greens and toppings and good size portion, because then I can eat a more balanced meal (most times I even have left overs of my sandwich too). My favorite sandwich is the shrooms sandwich - the mushrooms and mixture of cheeses tastes so decadent! Maybe eventually I will branch out to a new flavor sandwich... maybe.  On my most recent recent visit, I decided to have mac n' cheese and a side salad as all my friends were also ordering sides and appetizers for our get together. I liked the mac, so I'd probably recommend it, but I still prefer the sandwiches and salads so I personally would probably go back those in the future. My friends tried wings, fried mac n' cheese balls, pretzels, mac n' cheese, and poutine. They all enjoyed their selections. I didn't even see my friend eat a mac n' cheese ball - these must have been a favorite for them to disappear so quickly! Appetizers are half off during happy hour so you really can't beat the deal to try some fun, tasty appetizers.",

    "text": "This is a good place to go if you are looking for a casual decent meal along with a few beers. They pride themselves on their variety grilled cheese sandwiches, which I ended up taking their idea and making a better version at home... My fiance and I got two different ones that they waiter said were popular and each had half a sandwich. We had the Cheesy Capresey and the Wang Chung Tonight. Like I said they were decent, not as mind blowing as they make them sound... But then again they are just sandwiches. We were really disappointed when we didn't even taste any Gouda on the Wang Chung. Regardless each sandwich comes with your choice of fries (regular, old bay seasoned or sweet potato) and a cup of their tomato soup. The sweet potato fries were good! I'm not hard to impress with French fries though. The soup was a bit too smokey for my taste buds but the fiance enjoyed it. The ambiance reminds me of a college bar/restaurant. This may have to do because it's in an actual basement. There's lots of TV and just simplicity to the space. The actual bar area itself was small but cool. They have a TON of draft beers. Which I noticed a lot of people trying.  I'm still surprised that this place was booked for the night in reservations on a Saturday when they're literally tons of better places around. We just decided to just go and play it by ear, luckily we waited at the bar for 25 minutes then were seated. No complaints on the service. Just a plain, ok meal. Not running back, but wouldn't say no to go back!",

    "text": "So, my Juicy Lucy burger made me sick last night!  This was my 4th time having this burger here.  Everytime and including yesterday I have really enjoyed them.  Yesterday was different though.  The burger was undercooked and on the pink side throughout.  I know some burgers and other red meats can be cooked to order.  However, this burger has no such option and is supposed to be well done.  Also, my Juicy Lucy appeared to have no cheese inside which makes this burger unique.  In case you're reading this and aren't familiar with a Juicy Lucy burger, it is two 5oz patties molded together with cheese in the middle.  Upon your first bite you should encounter some melted cheese, this time I found no cheese!  Thus making the burger on the dry side.  Like I said, it was still good and didn't realize how disappointing it was until I woke up feeling ill this morning.  I can count prob on one hand how many times I've gotten sick from food ever, so pretty sure this undercooked burger was the culprit this time.  Cool thing is that if you add bacon there's no extra charge which is rare.  Hopefully this review won't deter you from trying this delicious burger, just figured I'd share my experience. Otherwise, this is a cool little establishment!  I prefer the bar area and it's ambiance rather than the dining area.  Call me a dork, but I like the colored mason jars that they usually serve water only in lol.  They have pretty good daily food and drink specials.  Also a great beer selection.  Their specialty is their unique ways of making grilled cheese sandwiches.  I haven't had one yet, but plan to next visit.  I'll be back soon, just wish I had a better Juicy Lucy this past trip!",

With that being said we did not end up trying food.  Edit 9/9/2014   Below you'll be able to see a comment of someone trying to defend and posting incorrect facts. I've been a member of Yelp since August 2012. My first post was indeed this review of this restaurant. Whenever you walk into this restaurant there is an open bar area, with a few tables to the right and I believe a juke box. The bar is in an L shape and off to the left is another area of seating. With what looks to be another bar are as well as a five top which is under a u shaped open area with glass. To say my review was malicious and False shows even more so that ownership is incompetent. We walked in, and the bartender told is to sit anywhere, we did so and after fifteen minutes of not being greeted we left. Whenever we left we told what seemed to be a bus boy that we were leaving because no one greeted us.",

Shadyside, especially Walnut, can be a little difficult, so take the negativity with a grain of salt.  That being said, I really like this place. And I can be particular; I get pissy when I waste a chance for a good time on a crappy place.  The Yard is worth it. In fact, I am getting too regular at wine and whiskey Wednesdays (1/2 off bottles of wine!!!!!!!!!).  Look, to address some negativity, they are a newer business and incredibly busy.  Maybe you won't get served within the first five minutes of being there but you're not at Eat N Park, sweetheart.  The staff is super sweet and is not trying to make you have a bad time.  Case in point, last I was there (for happy hour, around 6) there were a group of older women who were so fed up with the noise in the dining area, they asked the management to tell the happy hour-ers to quiet down (seriously).  Clearly, they can't do that, so they moved the ENTIRE TABLE (bar area is mostly high tops, which are not old lady friendly) to a spot in the slightly less noisy bar.  Patience is a virtue, especially when the reward is a huge grilled cheese with all kindsa delicious goop in it.  Oh! Make sure to go with a friend and force them to order sweet potato fries with cinnamon butter so you can eat those after you devour your seasoned potato wedges.  Goes great with the huge selection of beer, including some hard to find Imperials!  They also have a good happy hour, if you're lucky enough to get there before 7, and brunch with bottomleeeess (I wish I could underline that a million times) Mimosas/Bloody Mary bar on the weekends.  This place is pretty cool and not uppity like every single other bizarre place around the eastern neighborhoods.  Yins need to relax.. and have a 1/2 price bottle of wine.",

    "text": "So glad they take reservations via OpenTable. When we arrived, a table was ready for us even with a 45 minute wait for non reservations. They just changed their menu and added more unique grilled cheese sandwiches. I usually go to the Yard for the caprese salad. Much to my surprise, they created a \"cheesy caprese\" grilled cheese sandwich. It was the salad between toast and it was amazing. We also ordered the pork nachos and they were equally as good.",

    "text": "I was impressed with this place. Nicely done decor. Server was excellent, very friendly and attentive. My first thought was that the prices were high for a cheese sandwich, but I changed my mind when it came...they are HUGE and packed with toppings. I got the \"Big Chebowski\" which had cheddar, smoked gouda, bacon, and a fried egg. It was delicious and huge, I barely finished it. They are VERY greasy between the huge amount of cheese and the buttered bread, so beware! I also upgraded the soup to a mac and cheese, and I'll say theirs is probably the best mac and cheese I've had in this city. I'd come in just for that! The fries served with the sandwich are very good, but I'd say they are too heavy for these decadent sandwiches; I might have preferred something like a shoestring fry with this meal.  Criticisms...the menu is way too big. I'd rather see a handful of their best selections and maybe a couple daily or weekly specials items. The menu includes snacks, appetizers, and sides which seems like a bit much. And salads. (Who comes to places like this and gets a salad???) My husband had the tomato soup with his sandwich and he said it was nothing special. I'm also very surprised they don't have a \"build your own\" option.  All in all the food and service were excellent and I'll definitely be back in soon.",

But, I beat her in the dessert department, ordering \"Because We Got High.\" Well, I can start of by saying \"OMG.\" Because, oh my goodness that was so flipping good. There was Nutella, whipped cream, bananas, and ice cream...probably some fairy dust as well. Please order! It's huge.

    "text": "Definitely has a lot of potential!  Good location, good happy hour, decent menu, decent drink selection.  Located just off of Walnut, parking can be a little bit tricky, depending on when you come.  But, the actual restaurant space is pretty big and there's plenty of seating, so you don't have to worry too much about finding a table.  The bar space looks a bit trendier and the larger dining area that is connected lacks any decor.  We had a few beers from their extensive beer selection and a glass of their cabernet house wine.  House wine was pretty good, for being the house wine, but the pour was a tad bit on the small side.  Perhaps they should consider using a smaller wine glass to make you feel better about the tiny portion.  We also tried a few of the snacks and appetizers, which were half off during happy hour!  The Poutine fries were interesting.  They gave it a twist to the standard by using this cheese-beer-bbq-sauce?  It wasn't our fav, but I'm sure some would love the flavor.  The shrimp dish, which was good.  Not too heavy with a good flavor.    My favorite snack/appetizer was the soft pretzels with beer cheese.  I like bread a lot, but the pretzels did resemble bread more than pretzels.  And the only negative about this dish is that the beer cheese was pretty greasy and you could see the oil separating and forming a layer on top.  We also ordered one of their gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  We liked that all the ingredients were local and it was definitely not your average grilled cheese!  Overall, I am definitely going to have to come back to try their other happy hour specials and other menu items.  I also liked all the different nightly specials and events they have planned!  I have high hopes that the rest of the menu will be good and that future trips will be better and better.  I'll be sure to update my review at that time!",

At this point in time, I really like it because not too many people know about The Yard, so it's easy to find a seat even for a larger group.  So to give it a high rating means that I will have to deal with increased crowds (which I hate!).  That said, I really, really do like this place, so I obviously want it to succeed.  The Yard has extended happy hour on Monday-Thursday which includes $1 off drinks, a good (yet random) drink special, and 1/2 price apps and snacks; cool (and actually competitive) trivia where people can't cheat by looking up answers on their smart phones; decent food at decent prices; an extensive draft list (that does get a bit pricey); an awesome Saturday/ Sunday brunch; and decent service.  Another aspect of this place is that it is in the basement so WiFi and phone service is spotty at best.  Make solid plans with your friends before heading there unless you want to keep walking up an down stairs to get reception.  I don't mind so much because it forces people to actually interact with whom they came.    Go ahead, give The Yard a go.",

    "text": "They finally had the grilled cheese! I had been there within the first few weeks when I was told by the waiter that they did not have the ingredients to make the grilled cheese...so I had to come back to give it a try. (Also they did not have some of the beers on the menu, which I found odd..why have things on the menu you can not offer?).  The good: I ordered the Big Che-bowski (spelling) sandwich, and it was DELICIOUS. I was so hungry by the time I got it, I must have eaten the whole sandwich and cajun fries in 7 minutes. I would definitely recommend the food.  The bad: It really was not too busy at the time we came in, there were a few full tables, but plenty of empty tables as well. It took entirely way too long for our waitress to even acknowledge us. After walking in, and a kind sir telling my friend and I to sit anywhere, I assumed we would get waited on immediately. The waitresses did not seem like they wanted to give any customers the time of day. They were scrambling around, and did not make eye contact with any customers.They would go to a table, and then quickly turn around and run back into the kitchen as if they did not want another customer to bother them. Finally, another table who had seen my friend and I waiting at an empty table for fifteen minute, told the waitress who gave them their checks that we needed menus. She apologized and told us she would get us our menus. Another ten minutes passed before we even got menus. (Yes it was ten minutes, at this point we decided to keep track of the time of service..we were debating on leaving, but really wanted to try the grilled cheese). After ordering it only took 13 minutes to get our food (which was the only fast part of this experience!).  During our meal, we overheard the waitresses apologizing to customers for the wait, and thanking them for being patient multiple times. If I had a nickel for every time she apologized to my friend and I..I'd have myself a free grilled cheese and then some.   They were very kind, but I just did not understand why the service was so so slow. If anything, that's The Yard's biggest and worst downfall. If they work on that..maybe things will go up for them.",

I know grilled cheese sandwiches are usually boring--not here! I had one with ham and it was so good-- not soggy and delicious. Served on bread that could have been homemade it was so good. The place was active and fun. The best part of the night, besides the food, was our waitress who had a Boston accent. I think her name was Erin. She could not have been more helpful or accommodating with a member of our group who is always a picky eater. She was very attentive and we were never wanting for anything, even when she got busy. Plus I saw her help out a fellow employee and, as a former waitress, I always think co-workers helping someone else is a sign of good restaurant teamwork, so I figure the restaurant must be good.

It had a little bit of spice from the sriracha mayo, arugula and avocado, plus the traditional tomato and onions, served on a delicious bun from a local bakery, it was served with delicious french fries too.  The fries were not your normal fries, they were like curly fries meets steak fries and seasoned perfectly!  My husband had the pulled pork sandwich, he loves pulled pork and said that it was one of the best he's had.  This was served with the most amazing sweet potato fries and a brown sugar dipping sauce, which made them that much more enjoyable.  The atmosphere is very warm and inviting.  We sat in the restaurant area, but the bar area is beautiful with 36 different beers on tap, a beautiful stone bar with an amazing copper top.  These guys thought of everything, the bar has hooks for the ladies purses, AND THE BEST PART, there are outlets every 4 feet or so with USB ports to charge your phones!!  I would recommend this place for sure!  It's clean, great service, great food, and a large variety of craft beers and adult beverages!",

    "text": "Before the calendar struck January 5 (MY official date for New Year's resolutions), I had to get in a grilled cheese at The Yard.  So, off to The Yard I went, eager to see what their grilled cheese menu had in store. The menu is BIG and every single sandwich sounded like grilled cheese heaven.  After much debate, I settled on the SHROOMS, which consisted of provolone, garlic herbed mushrooms, carmelized onions and greens.  My expectations were high. And you know what happens when your expectations are too high...  As far as the service at The Yard goes, our server was exceptionally friendly and chipper - always appreciated.  However, on a day that didn't seem all that busy, the wait was fairly extensive.  The company was great so I didn't mind, but 30 minutes for a grilled cheese? I dunno...  When our food arrived the sandwiches were hot, but the soup was cold and the fries cold and limp.  I mentioned the soup sitch to our server, who microwaved it and brought it back to the table. It was during her departure that we both noticed the fries and I didn't have the heart to complain about those as well.  And while the sandwich was hot, it honestly didn't have that much cheese, which I thought was strange.  So - hmm - I want to love it here, but I'm afraid that The Yard might be a case of a restaurant that wants to be cool and trendy but is forgetting that the food is really the most important part of a great restaurant experience.  I'm a little sad about it.  Worth 2 stars, but 3 since the menu was so creative.",

It was good but still not to die for. The sides of Cajun fries and tomato soup were very good     What was really good was the dessert which was called (because we got high). This is  a monster you want under your bed. Two peaces of fried bread with Nutella, bananas and peanut butter inside. Flowing off it like a blob is marshmallow fluff and a chocolate drizzle. It was the perfect mix of salty and sweet. It's best split between 2 or 3 people. Alone it must be ones calories for a week. But so worth it.   I would say give this place a try but don't fall for the hype.",

    "text": "We went to the Yard a few Sundays ago to enjoy a nice afternoon brunch with fellow yelper and friend Laura M.  We met right around noon.  As Laura pointed out our desire to have some adult bevvy's at a reasonable price and a lot of them on top of that helped sway our decision to make our first brunch meeting at the Yard.  My first impressions of the place was awkward.  It's located in a basement, no real actual natural light except from the entrance the you can see from the bar. We sat in the dining area off the bar.  Now since it was a basement the room echoed everyone's voice so it was also on the loud side, so our conversation was projected and certainly kept getting louder as the drinks kept coming... Matt and I both ordered the CHORIZO SCRAMBLE Spicy Chorizo / crumbled Eggs / Fresh Pico de Gallo/Cilantro/Sour Cream/Served over Home Fries.  I had the unlimited Bloody Mary bar, and he had the bottomless mimosa.  My meal looked appetizing but it was pretty dry.  I found myself dumping ketchup on it to give it some moisture, and I am no fan of the red stuff.  I took more home than I ate and tried mixing into an omelet but it wasn't that good either so I ended up pitching it.   The service was really good.  Our server was attentive, unfortunately our table was really wobbly.  So wobbly we nearly spilled our drinks a few times.  We tried to fix the problem the most classiest way possible by shoving sugar packets and napkins under the leg but it didn't help.  Another employee came over to assist but noted it was actually the table top not the base that was the issue... So we just had to endure it.  Our \"brunch\" seriously turned into a 6 hour marathon.  After Laura left we eventually made our way out to the bar to switch it up and have a few beers and watch some football.  The bar was pretty cool and one of the servers took our picture since it was our one year wedding anniversary.  Funny though I think I look a little tipsy in that picture.  I did have about 6 Bloody Mary's and a few beers, but I wasn't driving so who's counting...    The yard is more of a 3.5 since the bar and staff were great and my company was awesome but my food left something to be desired.   I think in the future I would try one of their sandwiches or burgers, maybe one of those colossal grilled cheese...  I saw a couple come out and they looked very tempting...",

    "text": "I came here for brunch with Carrie W. and her husband Matt this past Sun.  We decided to come here primarily because of the bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys.  Although we arrived here at noon and stayed until after 3, our waitress ensured that our glasses never ran dry.  I had the bottomless mimosas, and was only planning on drinking 3, but I must have drank 5-6, so you know they were good!  I was quite tipsy by the time I left--good thing I walked here...  For my entree, I ordered off of the brunch menu, and decided on the s'more waffles.  I was expecting one waffle, but when the dish came out, it was huge, consisting of two (see photo)!  Although I enjoy French toast, waffles, and pancakes with sweet ingredients, the waffles were a bit sweet even for me.  I also felt that they were rather dry, esp. on the inside, and that more sauce would have helped.  Then again, it probably would have made it even sweeter, so perhaps it wouldn't have been a good thing.  Quite honestly, if my rating were based on the food alone, it would be a 3.  However, between the bottomless mimosas and the great service we received, I feel that an extra half star is merited.  I wish I would have gotten the waitress's name so I could give her a shout-out--unfortunately, they don't wear name tags here.  The ambiance was quite casual, albeit a bit loud.  And of course, the company was great! I'll have to return for dinner to try one of the colossal grilled cheeses, since that's what they're known for--if/when I do, I'll write an update.  3.5 stars.",

Here are to high points: - Warm and friendly hostess; - Lots of interesting beers; - Knowledgeable wait staff and bar-tenders who know their beers! - A proper dining room if you're so inclined; - Interesting selection of grilled cheeses; - They take reservations!  Overall, this is a fun and comfortable place for a great beer and/or a decent meal.  My grilled cheese was very good, but the sweet potato fries were below average - a touch soggy, and I think the deep-fry oil was past its best.

    "text": "I've been to The Yard several times and am usually pretty impressed with them. This occasion was for Sunday brunch, so my group and I were sure to make a reservation to avoid any wait time. That was a good decision as the restaurant was pretty packed! We started with the mac attack balls, which were delicious as always. Crispy on the outside and served with a creamy sriracha sauce which really makes the appetizer amazing. I then had the beignet pancakes with raspberry puree and ricotta whipped cream. They were delicious and looked aesthetically pleasing. However, the reason the review gets four stars is because of the mimosas. Being that The Yard is the only local Shadyside place that offers bottomless mimosas, my group and I chose to go here over various other brunch options. However, the mimosas were basically all orange juice and no champagne. We also ordered some vodka drinks, and the pours were basically nothing. The bartender that day must have been generally skimping on alcohol, which I was unhappy about given that I ended up paying something like $60 for my entire meal and drinks. Other than that, no complaints. The service was quick and professional, and it was a Steeler game Sunday so there were plenty of strategically placed TV's to watch! Definitely worth a brunch trip for the food alone.",

I loved the texture.   We also got a few entrees and split them. My hubby got the chicken and waffles which were delicious. I really liked the bacon maple syrup. I got one of the grilled cheeses called the Wang chunk tonight, which had this delicious sweet chili chicken on it. I really liked it. I also got it with the cajun fries. I was not really impressed with both the fries or the tomato soup,  but the grilled cheese was so good!   We also got dessert (I know dessert at brunch,  but we were full until the next day at dinner time) which was called the because I got high. This is the most decadent and ridiculous dessert I have ever encountered. Everyone should get one to share with 6 friends!   Overall I can't wait to go back  and try more of the menu!",

    "text": "I came here with a few friends for brunch on a Saturday that everyone in Shadyside was celebrating St. Patrick's day. Because I had one too many frozen cosmo's the night before, I wasn't in the mood for green beer, but they had plenty other options. The hostess had that rude \"couldn't-be-bothered\" sort of attitude to her, but I wasn't about to let a 21 year old make ME (a paying customer) feel like a jerk for not having a reservation to a neighborhood pub that serves green beer on a Saturday morning. She seated me promptly after an eye roll or two.   The waiter was more than accommodating with lots of water and coffee for the table and was pretty hilarious for most of the meal. My friends got the grilled cheese with pierogies and I opted for the chorizo scramble. My dish needed lots of extra seasoning to make it not taste like a bland heap of nothing. I finally got it right after hitting it with salt, pepper, AND hot sauce. It still wasn't good and I only ate about 1/3 of it. My friend's all reported that the grilled cheese was extra greasy and really not all that great, but the fries with the old bay hit the spot.   My only regret is not visiting here during happy hour because their draft list and bar area looked pretty amazing. There were lots of beers I hadn't heard of and the prices didn't seem that unreasonable. The place definitely prides itself on it's beer selection, as the first 4 pages of the menu featured various different sorts of beer.   Oh, and the music was bad. Like laughably, noticeably bad.",

GO TO THEIR BRUNCH. No, really though. It seems as though the full menu is available during brunch hours and they offer $15 bottomless mimosas so really, you have no reason to go any other time, at all.  And those mimosas? Truly bottomless. Like, I can't tell you how many I had because my glass was rarely actually empty. I don't know why a previous poster complained about this! Yes, the servers are attentive and come by often to refill...how is that a negative? You order bottomless mimosas, don't you want to get your money's worth and enjoy the deal? Our party certainly appreciated our service! The server was very friendly and talkative and though she came by often, didn't interrupt our conversation, simply refilled the drinks. Wonderful!  Everyone in our party got various grilled cheese sandwhiches, many of which have clever names. I got a kick out of \"Shrooms\" and the dessert \"cheese\": \"Because we got high.\" (What can I say? Maybe I laugh easy.)  I I got the fried green tomato grilled cheese, and added a fried egg onto it that I'm pretty sure was free of charge. It was delicious: fried green tomatoes, hickory smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, and red pepper spread (and my egg!) MmmMmm...  The cheeses all come with a cup of tomato bisque soup, which was actually the only downfall of the meal. It tasted medicinal? to me. The other 3 people in my party loved it though, so perhaps this was just me. Not enough to subtract a star.  The fries that come with the meal come in a variety of different styles: regular, sweet potato, old bay, cajun, and garlic parm. No up-charge for the specialty styles.  We will definitely be back,  we even said this should be a monthly tradition! Can't wait to go back and try another type of cheese...I already have my eye on one with gouda....",

Best to go during afternoon, before the music gets too loud. The staffs are friendly! We like sitting at the bar - and it helps when they have my favorite drink on tap, bumble berry from fat heads!  In terms of food, their pierogi with bacon bits are delicious! Gives a nice and flavorful taste to the pierogi. Also, the shrimp appetizer is pretty good, but the dipping sauce is nothing special. If you are okay with eating unhealthy, the soft pretzel is not bad, but be warned, it is literally deep fried! Out of everything we've had, the chicken sandwich however, is nothing special. Regardless, I would love to go back again to try more food with my beer.  Before I forget, they have some nice big miller light (i believe) drinks for a nice deal at night. Unfortunately I don're remember the details. But I will be back, and hopefully find out next time.",

Both were wonderful. They had a good selection of beer on tap as well. The only downside was despite them not being super busy the service was lacking. We were never given napkins or utensils and our waitress didn't come back until we asked for our check. Disappointing but the food alone can keep at least 3 stars. May try it again in hopes the service is better.",

    "text": "Ambiance:  Modern gastropub with a neighborhood feel.  Located in a basement just off of walnut street.  Bar area with numerous TV's on the right and separate dinning area to the left with some TVs.  Food: Wide variety of fairly standard gastropub type food including burgers, wings, a wide variety of apps, salads, etc...  Of note, they do have about 25 gourmet grilled cheese offerings which are paired with a cup of tomato soup and french fries.  I've tried 3-4 of them and all have been pretty good.  Also recommended are the flatbreads, particularly the imperial swine.  Drinks: About 40 beers on top with options of 12, 16, or 32 ounce as well as mix-and-match flights.  Pretty good selection of regional and national craft brews.  A few hard to find beers make it in here from time to time, though not as \"beer nerdy\" of a selection as Caliente's or Sharp Edge.  Also with a full bar including some craft cocktails and a decent wine selection, though I usually stick to beer here.  Service: Always have had attentive, knowledgeable service.  Tips/Extras: Not the best cell phone service as it is in the basement.  Trivia is on Wednesday's.  Good daily specials on food and drinks.  Overall: A great place to stop for food or drinks.  The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars is that while everything here is done well, nothing really stands out as amazing.",

I had the standard cheese sandwich added bacon it was a good cheese sandwich!  It came with tomato soup, I thought it was ok , but it didn't taste like the tomato soup that I'm used Too!  On the weekend during brunch time they have all you can drink bloody Mary's and Mimosas!  I'd love to go back and try there pancakes they look so good!

    "text": "I enjoy the concept of this restaurant. The extensive grilled cheese menu is the obvious draw. Anything you can think of is made into a grilled cheese. They have multiple options for your sides of fries including garlic parm, old bay, and sweet potato. All their grilled cheeses come with a side of fries, and a little cup of tomato soup. We've had some of their appetizers and they were nothing to write home about.   I've gone multiple weekend days where they do $15 bottomless mimosas. Although they clearly are not as strong or well made as standard mimosas, I enjoy being able to sit and chat with people for a few hours drinking mimosas and snacking for $15.   They have a different special every week night as well but my favorite is every Monday they have all of their grilled cheeses half price. I have a hard time going any other time for grilled cheeses because it's such a good deal on Mondays!  The atmosphere could be better. It's nothing too special on the inside and sometimes can be quite loud if you're sitting in the bar area. Also we have had some questionable servers. One was downright rude to us and ignored us.   All in all, it's a cool place to experience as least once if you love options and grilled cheese sandwiches but don't expect anything amazing in terms of an overall experience.",

The service is good, and the venue is located in busy Shadyside so it's a good place to go for dinner and a drink before a night out. Overall a relaxed atmosphere with some amazing comfort food!

    "text": "The Yard has a ton of potential to be a great bar and casual restaurant. A large space combined with a comprehensive food and beer menu tell the best story.    During my recent trip to Pittsburgh I ended up at the Yard twice. The first time was for a night cap drink and the second time was for another night cap drink and a little snack. Well it was a little snack for me, as I just picked off my friend's huge Pierogie Grilled Cheese sandwich. I'm talking ginormous; Texas toast and full sized Pierogies- it was the works. He also ordered a side of Mac 'N Cheese. That was also pretty tasty, but I just warn that bacon was included. I love bacon however I wouldn't be happy if I was vegetarian and found bacon in my food without notice.   I'm not going to walk you through the extensive menu or drink list, but I highly recommend you check it out yourself. Both nights I went for a local brew and thoroughly enjoyed my Fat Head's Bumble Berry.  Our server the first night was very patient and happy to answer any questions about the brews. The second night we ordered from the bar and the bartender of the evening rubbed me the wrong way. I asked him for a printed copy of the beer list so I can review the beer selection. He provided a menu but also told me that the beers were listed above the tap. Well, duh. I saw the list but it didn't have the detailed description I was looking for. It wasn't a big deal; I just hope he doesn't do that often.   Under the category of random and cool, there was an outlet on the customer side of the bar. That is such a good idea! I mean, how many times has your phone been dying or died while you are out at a bar?  So overall, I had a great experience. I'm sure after the growing pains, The Yard will turn into a staple establishment in Shadyside.",

They have the cool text system to let you know when your table is ready. But while you're waiting-- why not go ahead and grab a beer? Definitely highlight is the number of beers they have on tap and it constantly rotates!   I got the pumpkin cider-- and it was the best pumpkin flavored drink I got, tasted super \"spicey\"  Nachos-- the food was a little sparse and pretty sure the chips are Tostitos, very salty  Smack yo mama-- yum! Love the bread, not sure which bakery they get it from. Chicken was good, but the cheese could have been melted a bit more. Tomato soup was mehh. French fries could be better also, but I love the variety of seasoning!",

She alone makes my visit here wonderful with her funny jokes and her attentiveness towards her customers. It could be borderline overwhelming how attentive she is, but that's being modest of the great service.   The place itself is lively with the jukebox right in front of the door, but for anyone who is looking to chat with a friend or do business, don't be alarmed. The music does not get carried over immensely to the dining area.   What really attracts me to the Yard of course is the GRILLED CHEESE! For an average of $11 to have a huge gourmet grilled cheese, tomato soup, and your choice of fries is a bargain. Not to mention they have DAILY specials! We came in on half off wine and $4 whiskey. It was definitely worth every penny I spent.   For any BBQ lovers the Smack Yo Mama grilled cheese is heavenly sweet and the pulled chicken has a nicer texture than pulled pork.   Lastly the Cause We Got High dessert is hands down one of the best desserts to get if you're a huge chocolate fan, willing to get diabetes, or to have as a sweet topping on a nice evening out drinking.",

The food was good, service was fast, BUT the noise level was astounding. We were one of maybe ten parties (and this place has a lot of tables), yet the music was so LOUD that I had to shout across the table to my fiance. There's no reason for that. The sound level is absurd.  Second time we went was a Sunday morning, to try out brunch. This was a serious mistake. We both got chicken and waffles. It was disgusting. The waffle was squishy and tasted like sour milk. The chicken was a super flat patty that was hard to cut and harder to chew. Neither of us finished our meals. Again, the music was obnoxiously loud.  We've been on a few other occasions because we like the food, it honestly the noise level is a huge deterrent. I leave with my ears ringing every time.",

    "text": "This was the first time I came across a gastropub that could be said to specialize in grilled cheese, at least in Pittsburgh. The selection was remarkable with over 20 choices ranging from traditional to breakfast style with egg and bacon, or with artisinal ingredients. They are served with tomato soup and fries which come seasoned with a number of choices including Cajun, parm, and old Bay. There were others but I was sold on old Bay. There are also plenty of other menu items for those that do not want to go the grilled cheese route.   I ordered the turkey Cristo wood was quite delicious. The cheese was perfectly melted and the berry compote added that sweet balance to the salty sandwich. It wasn't battered like a traditional Cristo but I take no issue with that. It is a grilled cheese take after all. Only issue there was the bread was a tad soggy in the middle of the sandwich. The fries were hand cut and delicious. The negative was I did not care for the tomato soup at all. It was a smoked tomato soup and the smoked flavor was overpowering. In general I only like a smokey flavor in barbecue meats so this was a turn off for me. For those that like that sorry of thing it's probably great.   The server was expedient and on top of our order but odd. Also they did not carry my first beer selection yet it was still on the menu. Neither was a deal breaker. A big plus was Champions League soccer on TV.   Overall was a really good gastropub and I will be returning.",

    "text": "There's a whole page devoted to grilled cheese! Not a half page, not one plain grilled cheese, A WHOLE PAGE! That should give you an automatic star right there.   With so many choices it was really hard to make a decision, but I finally settled on the Fried Green Tomatoes Grilled Cheese. It not only comes with fries, but the ultimate pairing, tomato soup! Certainly a very full meal.  Everything came out looking and smelling divine. The grilled cheese certainly satisfied my craving. It had big ole' fat slabs of bacon, lots of cheddar cheese and green tomatoes. The bread was on a thick Italian loaf too. But the hot tomato soup I yearned for on this cold dreary day was luke warm, as were the fries.   We asked our server (my friends was lukewarm too) to warm them up, and that she did. Aside from the fact that it didn't come out hot, it was really good and different. It had a smokey flavor to it, and went well with my sandwich, that I happily dipped in.   They have a variety of differently seasoned fries you can choose from as well. I went with the cajun fries. They looked like freshly cut large wedges from the potato. I wish they had been a bit crispier, and as noted, warmer. I think that would have made them good. I probably would just try their normal fries the next time, and maybe see if they were crispier.   Our server was very friendly, but being a waitress, I'm wondering if she's the one that let our food sit under the warmer until she could get to it. It was busy inside, but she made sure to check on us multiple times, so she definitely wasn't running around like a chicken with her head cut off.   Kudos for the 90's soundtrack. I enjoyed listening to the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears while I ate my lunch. I'm very excited to come back for brunch (hello Bloody Mary bar!) and even more excited about them opening for lunch (from what I hear).   I do believe they'll be a success, as it was packed on a very rainy, dreary day, when most people (like myself) didn't even want to leave the house.'s",

The second time, however, I ordered the breakfast sandwich and it was great! I would definitely order that one again. Also, I understand the concept of grilled cheese and soup - but the soup is nothing to write home about. But I do really enjoy their sweet potato fries with cinnamon butter - it is soo good. The service was a home run the first time and a strike out the second time even though it was less busy the second time around. Would I come here again? Probably but not for a while!  P.S. Their wake and bake dessert is absolutely amazing.",

    "text": "I'm giving The Yard 2 stars because I did not get food poisoning. This is my first time reviewing a restaurant and last night was my first time in any dining establishment not leaving a tip. It is now early afternoon on a beautiful pittsburgh day. It has been about twelve hours since my friends and I entered the twilight zone of The Yard. Like the Zone,we soon discovered that entering is a lot easier than getting out.  Besides a few ordering hiccups (one of my friends has Celiac disease, and so ordered her sandwich gluten-free, and the waiter then interpreted that as we all wanted gluten-free bread. gross.) the actual dining experience was pleasant. The chef corrected the gluten misunderstanding and our food arrived in a timely and aesthetically pleasant state. I had actually gotten someone to cover my shift at work so I could meet my friends and sample the infamous grilled cheese. Expectations for the food were high and well met. I will never go back to that purgatory again. Here's why.  Before our waiter even brought the check, I asked if it was possible to split it for our party of six. I understand that is a miserable task, and only asked because we were one of three active tables in the bar. As a former waitress myself, I would have been fine if he'd refused the delineation. With slurred, fragmented speech he assured us it would not be a problem, and shuffled off to the kitchen to separate the tabs.   He came back a moment later with one long check, and mumbled something about how orders were according to seats 'so you guys can just do that.' We didn't understand either. This was 11:45pm and that's an important detail. We asked him to write our initials next to our orders (most of us had ordered two items). Flustered, he grabbed his pen and we began the painstaking task of trying to communicate with a scotchbrite sponge. Actually, a sponge would have been less frustrating because it is not encased in the facade of a sentient human being. In what was surely the quietest, most patient 7 minutes of our groups time (3 of my friends are currently waiters), we spoke with the slow deliberate manner of a parent explaining addition to a six year old. A six year old how just wasn't going to get it. Eventually he scooted off to the back.   He returned less than twenty seconds later and laid the same check on the table. It had not been written on so we were all a bit puzzled, and we were further confused to find attached an additional check for another table. As friend (a waiter) stressed the importance of patience, and began writing clear, itemized instructions of which food and drink went to what name. We jokingly whispered in debate about whether he was high or drunk. Both sides made solid cases but I remain convinced it was the latter.   He returned and we gave him the check, and also asked that we not be charged for the wings, as they were probably for another table. He nodded and mumbled incoherently. When he returned 10 minutes later with the same check yet again, it was printed anew, a clean slate free of our cluttered, specific instructions. We asked if he had noticed our notes. He said he could not read the handwriting. If nothing else, please trust me when I say we were all just trying to get out of there. It was 45 minutes into the process of paying and we had made no progress. THE HANDWRITING WAS PERFECT. He had also kept the wings. As we went around the table a third time, it was slightly funny that we all knew each others orders by heart, like an oft repeated word salad Pledge of Allegiance. The level of incomprehension with this guy was amazing. I was amazed. Amazed that as he came to me, he asked for the third time if I'd gotten the gluten free sandwich. And then if I'd gotten the growler. Wrong on both accounts of course. I clearly, crisply, and visibly annoyedly stated 'No, I did not get those items. I got the Big Chebowski, and the Anchor. That is it, That is all I ordered and received tonight.' Exasperated he mumbled something about a table to six being difficult, to which I channeled the Dude and replied 'Yeah, well, we've been through this three times man.' I asked if there was a register we could take our tab to. He mumbled and I guess it was something like a no. His final question before leaving: \"So, who got the wings?\"  Upon the fourth or fifth visit to the table, we were ECSTATIC to see five separate checks. By a higher power's grace, mine was actually accurate. Fate was not as kind to my friends, as there were still errors. Leaving them behind haggling with the waiter, I went to the bar with my card and check, and asked if I could pay there or anywhere but with our waiter. There was no way that guy was gonna touch my debit card. The bartender smiled and said no. I begged, briefly explaining the trouble the waiter was having. No sympathy.   I've run out of room in this review. Do not go to this place. We escaped an hour after first asking for the check. On a slow night.",

After sitting down we were quickly greeted by Wayne who stole my heart with his knowledge of the beer menu and the statement \"grilled cheese are our thing\". Wayne is seriously a great server. He recommended beers to me and when they didn't have what I chose he brought me 3 shooters of beers to choose from in a blind taste test. As for the food, I had the mac n cheese grilled cheese while my date had the pierogi n'at. It was all delicious. I'm in a serious carb coma right now but damn it was worth it! I skipped the tomato soup that comes with every grilled cheese in favor of the she crab soup which was good, not great. I felt like it had too much cheese and cream added and was really too rich. The fries were some crazy spiral cut wedges. Generally I dont like any kind of thick cut fries but these suckers are cooked and seasoned perfectly! If only I weren't so stuffed! I really want to try the dessert and decided we will have to go back just for a drink and some sweets. We will definitely be going back and hope that Wayne is there again.",

I spend 8 hours a day six days a week a lot of times taking care of people and the way she took care of us was professional. The grilled cheese are always spot on and delicious as well.

The atmosphere was good and the restaurant is nice but it was pretty loud, which was surprising for a Sunday night. The table next to us (very close together) had an issue with a food allergy, which was no one's fault - but the girl was having issues and the guy was very loud and obviously drunk. Other than the loudness though, our food was amazing. We both got lettuce wraps. This came with choice of fries or a sweet potato- we both ordered a sweet potato and neither of us got one. We didn't realize this until we had already left. Our waiter seemed very attentive at first, but he didn't come back to our table for a long time so we wouldn't have been able to even ask him for them even if we did realize. We asked for a refill with our water and he never brought one. The service was definitely not the best. We waited for a very long time for our lettuce wraps, while a table that came in after us got all 4 of their meals at least 10 minutes before us. I really liked the food (that we got), so this review is based on service, the time it took for us to get our food, and the fact that we never even got half of our meal. The food was great, so it's a shame the service made this review only get 3 stars.",

We both ordered grilled cheese: one \"it's always sunny in Philadelphia\" and one \"big chebowski\". There was very little filling in the first and it was missing one of the cheeses. The cheese was not melted and the bacon was only half cooked on the second.  The sweet potato fries were served with honey butter; if you can get passed dipping a fry in butter, pretty tasty. The garlic parmesan fries were mostly parmesan, and not fresh: the powdery kind you get from the unrefrigerated aisle at the market. All grilled cheeses are served with tomato soup;  love the idea, but the soup tasted canned and condensed. I want to love the place, but more homemade, quality stuff and better execution is a must.",

    "text": "This was my first time at The Yard and I was disappointed as I have heard great things about it from others. The service was incredibly slow, it took over 20 minutes to bring our drinks to the table (they were all beers), and they kept forgetting about my friend's beer. She finally received it 30 minutes later. The food also came out slow and was mediocre. I had the signature sliders, which were definitely the better of the group, but the hummus appetizer we ordered was bland. Granted, the restaurant was busy, but the service was inexcusable.",
