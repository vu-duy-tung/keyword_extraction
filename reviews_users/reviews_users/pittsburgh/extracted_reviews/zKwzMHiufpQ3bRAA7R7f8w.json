    "text": "After reading mixed reviews I was somewhat skeptical about trying this place out. I went during the week shortly after they opened for dinner and was pleased that the hostess was friendly and gave my any option of where I wanted to sit. She recommended the bar where they make the pizza so I took her up on the offer. The waitress was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.   We ordered the arancini for an appetizer and it was ok, but nothing special. For dinner we had the tagliatelle bolognese and the mambo Rosso pizza. The pasta was good but the pizza lacked some real flavor.   Im giving this place 2 stars bc I would have hoped for more in Sewickley. I'd go to Marios in Beaver, Anthony's Coal fire in Robinson or Stone in Pittsburgh. I also wasn't too happy about their kitchen. When you sit at the bar and the chef is just standing 10 feet from you, you might think that they make speak to you or see how you like the food. I'm not asking for a full blown conversation but the place wasn't even that busy. I would also think that the chef wouldn't rub his eyes and put eye drops in his eyes in front of customers.  I know that tons of things happen in kitchens that we probably don't want to know about but use some discretion when working in an open kitchen.",

There were many tables vacant but we were told we were not allowed to sit till the other couple arrived. We waited outside and smelled the smoke from the cigar bar beside the restaurant.  I had a caesar salad which was mainly romaine with croutons and a slice of thin cheese. I tasted no dressing, very bland. My wife and me split a pizza which was just OK. Good crust around the pizza but the bottom was limp and soggy, just OK. Corkage is $8 for a bottle of wine and you are given a tumbler, not even a stemmed glass for that amount. They gave us a bottle of water for the table but took it away and we had to ask for it back. I will not return and can not recommend.",

We had to tell our server that we didn't get our salad.  The chef sheepishly brought one over but by that time we were less than impressed.  It's amateur hour compared to il Pizzaioli or other upscale pizza restaurants.",

The restaurant was cool at 5:50. Upon our arrival, it was hot and humid and the door was open to the outside. It was about 90 degrees and miserably hot in the restaurant. It took over an hour to receive our food. We don't mind waiting for food, but in an environment that wAs extremely hot; it was unbelievable. The owner came over and was unapologetic for the food taking so long and instead of reassuring us it was almost ready, asked if we thought we were at Burger King. Eat at your own risk at this establishment!",

We sat outside, which was lovely, however I can see how it might be loud for people sitting inside.  The menu is creative and fun.  We split a Toscana salad (Arugula, asiago, pear, walnuts, champagne vinaigrette) and the portion was perfect for 2.  We also had the Pizza Vegetariana (Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, zucchini, eggplant, artichokes, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, fresh basil) and it was delicious.  This restaurant is BYOB with an $8 corkage fee.  It would be nice to see them lower the fee to $5, but after all, this is Sewickley.  Our service was prompt and cheerful.  I would enjoy going back again, and I would definitely recommend to a friend.",

The music volume so that you can talk but also hear it.  I started with a Caesar salad with no croutons. Then went into the funghi Margherita pizza with a request for a side of arugula to put on top. And had ice cream for dessert. My salad was delicious- crisp, fresh, cold, and garnished with a Parmesan crisp on top. They offered more grated cheese which I gladly accepted. The anchovies were separate and a bit strong. I prefer them integrated more.  My pizza took me back to Italy immediately! I ate it all!  For dessert I had the Caramel cashew vanilla ice cream. Wow! It tasted like butter pecan and I wanted to take a gallon home!  The service was great. Our waiter did not hover but was there when we needed him. The place is BYOB and the corkage charge was $8 per bottle of  wine and $1 per beer. This was surprising to me because I usually see places with a liquor license and corkage fee or no license and no fee.  Overall excellent feel, great food, and great service. I'll be back!",

There is a long table high top running down the middle of the place, where people are seated communal style.  There are a very few traditional low tables, all of which were occupied.  There are also a few tables outside, which would have been nice if the weather was better.  We ended up seated at the \"bar\" (interesting since it's BYOB).  Our first seats were close to where servers literally throw used plates, etc. into a bin for cleaning - very noisy.  We moved to the other end, which has a very nice view of the open kitchen and the pizza oven.Our pizza, the Montanara, was excellent, with added sausage.  We also shared a very nice arugula salad.  Go there if you like pizza and pasta, but only if you don't mind extreme loudness and high top communal tables.",

We get to the restaurant and the hostess informs us they don't take reservations. I asked well \"then who answered the phone and took the reservation?\" \"Oh\", she replies there are 2 restaurants with the same number. Very weird I thought, but still proceeded to put my name down. It's a very nice atmosphere the food smelled delicious.    As we stood and waited we noticed 4-5 open tables and 3 parties ahead of us. The hostesses were literally walking around in circles, not sure what was happening. 2 parties were seated and soon it was us and another couple waiting. Then it was us and the other couple left standing while people just walking in got tables because they had a party of 4. The hostess told my bf that it was the policy that 2 people can't sit at a table that holds 4 people. Funny, there wasn't one table in there that was for only 2 people. So we would have NEVER been seated this evening due to the people all coming in for a late dinner. We left after witnessing how unorganized this place was. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know. It's a shame the food smelled and looked great.",

Specifically, in terms of the customer experience, I felt that there was a line being walked, and it wasn't a good one.  I had a large party and I knew that the restaurant doesn't take reservations.  I stopped by in person several weeks beforehand to inquire how to go about getting a big group into the restaurant, and was advised to use NoWait and/or call ahead.  When we arrived to check in, we were told that we likely had a 45 minute wait and advised to go somewhere nearby to have a drink and wait it out. I wasn't surprised and had already managed the expectations of the group.  So, we did exactly that, and by some miracle a table freed up within minutes.  A friend and I returned immediately to claim our spot, and as soon as we sat down I texted back to my friends to let everyone else know to come back quickly as soon as they were finished with their drinks (that they had just ordered) at the other location.  In the several moments that followed, I was approached by both a hostess and the manager one after the other, and was informed that if the rest of my party didn't show up asap, others could get seated in their place because they didn't like to leave seats empty.  I understand the economics of having empty seats in a restaurant that can't sell alcohol, but frankly, that shouldn't have been made my issue when I complied with everything that was asked of me, and circumstances beyond either of our control made for a delay in seating the whole party.  That said...our server took really excellent care of us, and the food was absolutely delicious.  She was even willing to try and work with us to sort out the check because apparently they will not split checks for large parties. Unfortunately, the split that was offered was to do it equally 5 ways between the 10 of us, which would have been very unfair to some people in the group. So we did go with the one check and sorted out money exchange among ourselves.  Again, I understand the economics of that from the business side, but all in all, I don't think this restaurant is friendly to large parties, and I wouldn't try to bring one here again.",

    "text": "Went back after the last time they told us we had to come back because they had 2 minutes til they opened.  They turned me off right away by telling us parties of 2 can't sit at the table...they are for parties of 4.  We could either sit at the bar or the booth/chair combo (where the tables are about 4 inches apart).  I do not like dining at the bar, but chose that.  We ordered the gnocchi and a pizza.  I guess I should have read the menu better because I'm used to spaghetti sauce on my gnocchi.  These are made in a sage/butter combination.  They were ok, but not anything like my husband's Italian grandmother used to make.  The server was kind enough to give us a cup of sauce.  Unfortunately, it had a sour-like taste and very unappealing.  The pizza is ok at best, plus they cut it into 4 jumbo slices. They need to make the slices normal for people to share instead of the customers cutting every slice in half  Price wise, this place isn't worth it.  I think the gnocchi was $17 and you get about 13-15 of them.  Very noisy.  Couldn't even hear my husband  and he's sitting next to me.  Only good thing about this place is the decor.",

    "text": "Mambo Italia has become quite popular since it opened last year in Sewickley. Every time I drive by Mambo, it seems packed to the brim. I've only been here twice, but I can say that the pasta is very fresh. Both times, I went with their gnocchi, and it's melt in your mouth goodness. The best gnocchi, I've ever had!  Garnished with basil and ricotta cheese, it's prepared to perfection. This is not your typical rubbery, tasteless gnocchi, but a delicate gnocchi with even a potato taste and consistency.  So before this becomes solely an ode to their gnocchi, I will mention that my experiences with the waitstaff has been mixed. In particular an instance with their hostess did not sit very well with me. She was neither welcoming nor very professional. Thus some of the run-ins mentioned by other reviewers do not seem like much of a stretch.   But if you are just going to the food, it is worth it. Just keep in mind you will pay a premium for it ...",

As for the food - it's okay - not spectacular, not bad.  There are other options around that are so much better for specialty pizza and fresh pasta dishes.  On the downside - $8 cork fee for the BYOB.    A three star review on Yelp is A-OK and a 2 star is \"meh, I've experienced better\".  Yes, no doubt we've experienced better and yes, Mambo Italia is A-OK, even with the $8 upcharge.  Maybe a 2.5 star if I could.  Can't tell you when we'd go back - if at all.",

What a joke! Rude beyond words to ask a paying dinner party to leave just because they can't schedule the  restaurant properly.  The manager told the table next to them to wrap it up and leave too.

If I had known it would be double the amount of time to be seated than they told us, the food would be blah but expensive, and the service to be just okay, I never would have gone.  For starters, we had a party of 3. We checked in with the hostess to put our name on the list and were told it would be 30 minutes or less. I received a No Wait text confirmation on my phone and was told I would be texted when our table was available. It was cold out but we walked around and came back after 30 minutes. We ended up not getting seated for an hour and waited outside in the cold, the staff didn't seem concerned/apologetic for the inconvenience once they seated us.   The food was decent, but definitely NOT worth the price value. I got a the pesto white pizza which was $14 and the meatball appetizers for $9, both of which were just okay and definitely not worth the price. The pizza was wood fired but stretchy and bland, and the meatballs were hard and lacked flavor.   The service was a bit strange. It was a very cold night out and they left the door to the restaurant wide open....throughout our meal several customers were clearly cold and got up during their meal to close the door and the hostess didn't seem to care/accommodate at all for this.   The atmosphere in the restaurant was okay but the seating is a bit weird.   I definitely will not be going back.",

    "text": "Below is a previous review...we've always had a great experience at Mamba....last night was disappointing.  Reason being is I have gotten the chicken piccata several times in past and they served three medium sized breasts with a side...this visit they served three chicken tenders...two of the pieces might have been two bites and one was so small it was one bite.  Also, the pizza had three big burnt large bubbles...should have never have served us that pizza.  I do understand that with a wood fired oven like Marba has that one of the pizza qualities is small dark specks/bubbles on crust...but ours was over done on crust...also the pizza wasn't cut.  As far as Service...waited way too long for our salads...had no wait getting seated and the place wasn't full.  So no excuse for the slow service.  I dropped my review to three stars cause the atmosphere is always great...take away that and I would have given two.  I hope next visit is improved.  Get back the three chicken breast on the piccata....why change something that's perfect!!!  Thank you.  First review gave four stars...below write up.  After reading the reviews I had to chime in.  Have been here several times and it is very good.  The gnocchi is the best and served on Saturday only.  The pizza is awesome, chicken piccata and Romano style is great, the salads are great, the pasta dishes are good...one complaint I have is the bolognese sauce needs to be meatier.  Great atmosphere...yes, they have a large community table in center of restaurant, but it's very comfortable and roomy.  Yes, on a weekend night you'll have a long wait if you just show up and add your name to list.  They do use \" No Wait\" app...we use the No Wait app all the time for this restaurant and we time our arrival so we've never waited more than 1/2 hour.  The service is very good...one time we had a new server that made a couple mistakes, but it was handled perfectly by manager.  As far as some reviewers complaining about price...it's not overpriced for the quality you receive.  In today's restaurants an $8 per bottle corkage fee is not a bad price...in Sewickley you'd  be paying $8+ for mediocre glass of wine.  Highly recommend....use the No Wait app.",

I got the shrimp scampi, which didn't really taste much like scampi, had a sour vinegar taste, and came in a very small serving size. The person I was with got the chicken piccata, which she said was very bland. If this had been some super cheap restaurant, I would've shrugged it off, but it's on the pricier side.

    "text": "So loved this place!  I couldn't give it five stars for a couple of reasons I will explain shortly.  But first of all, I love the decor...it's like a rustic chic type of vibe.  The place isn't huge, but they fit a lot of seating between the pizza bar seats and the huge, long table in the center.  We are wood-fired, Neapolitan-style pizza snobs, having had some really great experiences where we used to live in Dallas and Minneapolis before that, so I'm happy to say that this pizza was up there!  So far the best from what we've tried in Pittsburgh so far.  The crust is good, red sauce is very tasty - two things you need for Neapolitan-style pizza to be on point.  We had the Mambo, which was good, but I'm excited to try different pizzas in the future.  The burrata appetizer is SO good.  At first, I was disappointed that it wasn't served with wood-fired cooked bread, but they serve it with perfectly dressed greens and cherry tomatoes that I thought went really well.  We also got the penne pasta with vodka sauce.  I'm a big fan of vodka sauce.  I didn't love the first couple of bites for some reason, but it grew on me and served as a great dipping sauce for the pizza crust.  A couple of changes I would recommend.  Do something with cooking bread (preferably drizzled with olive oil) in the wood fired oven...take full advantage of that thing!  I don't think it's necessary to serve bread to everyone but it would have been a nice touch for at least the burrata app, maybe even other apps too.  The other recommendation is to put out some olive oil bottles and maybe even balsamic vinegar bottles.  The crust of this type of pizza is best dipped in olive oil.  Otherwise, I personally won't eat it (although the vodka sauce did serve as a good dip).  Also, we didn't bring wine, but an $8 corking fee is a bit excessive.  I think $5 is reasonable.  But that wouldn't keep me from coming back.",

    "text": "This was my third time eating at Mambo, for various reasons such as trying a new place, going along with friends who wanted to eat here, giving it one more chance.  The wait is way too long each and every time.  They might have regulars, but that showing preference should not happen in this business.  My last visit, we used the app NO WAIT, and still had to wait longer than expected. We ate at a large, long table who had a party of ten at the other side - they all got served their dinner before us and so did other tables.    When we asked about the Pancetta pasta, the server said it was cream, pancetta is pork, when asked about the delicious cheese, the server did not know the name of it. We could not get additional appetizer plates, nor additional forks or spoons as the dishwasher broke.  The food is great - the service, servers and atmosphere, not so much.  Wade",

The waiter came by our table 5 minutes after we were seated.  We ordered our food at 8:30 pm.  Our food arrived at 9:05 pm.  Both meals were bland.   Don't expect bread and dipping oil (pretty standard at Italian).  The kitchen is visible from the seating area and the kitchen staff and table staff moved about very casually without seeming to have much care for the patrons.  And the front \"garage\" style door was open, so bugs were present throughout our time.  We live within a 10-minute drive. With so many good options in the village, we won't be going back to Mambo and we won't recommend it to others.",

    "text": "I had low expectations because the reviews weren't amazing but I was really pleasantly surprised!!   First of all I have to comment on the service...AMAZING. probably the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time. Our waitress was extremely attentive but not invasive and never left us without a full drink (in some tiny glasses!) We sat at the pizza bar and some of the chefs behind the bar checked on us as well and were interested as to whether we liked our food. Every person I encountered on the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   Now the food, we started with the wedding soup which was very tasty and had lots of \"stuff\" in it, which is great! Next was the mambo pizza and one more (whose name I forget) that had ricotta, Peruvian peppers and sausage. Both were Delicious. The crust was crispy on the outside and slightly charred, and the inside was soft and doughy. The toppings were plentiful and extremely fresh. Half a pie was enough for both of us.   Finished a great meal with a piece of tiramisu, which was delicious and was inhaled so quickly I can't comment on it much more. I thought the \"m\" on top in powdered sugar was a cute touch.   The atmosphere inside was loud but in an energetic way. Just be wary if you prefer quiet dining because there was definitely not a quiet spot in the place. I liked sitting at the pizza bar because we could watch the chefs work. For two sodas, soup, two pizzas and dessert the bill came to $59.",

I'm not sure whether it was a rough day for him or what was going on, but there is no reason for what happened this evening. It started with him slamming the bottles of water on the table, sliding the wine glasses. Did not pour the wine after uncorking the bottle along with throwing the wine cork onto the table.  Our bread was delicious, but it wasn't offered to us, we had to ask for it and; even then, it arrived ten minutes after our meal. We were never asked how our meals were. But don't worry, we were asked if we would like dessert.",

Put our name on list at 5:45 with wait of 2 hours.  At 8:45 still did not have table and appears they Gave our 5 top to someone else by mistake.  Would not admit it though and refused to sit us at a 4 top with and extra chair for our 5th person even though this chair was open since we were told to show for our table.  We waited an extra 30 minutes while that table and extra chair sat open and still didn't get seated.  Ended up going to Vivo as Sam took care of us.  Yea to Vivo.  No more trips to Mambo for us.  We would normally go there with anywhere from 2-8 people at a time.  Totally disrespected!",

The atmosphere at Mambo is decent, and the food sometimes borders on great, but the service is almost always remarkably slow, and is sometimes outright snotty. Other reviewers capture the specifics in detail, so if you want to read episodic outrage or delight, read those reviews. From mine, take that when you visit Mambo, you have slightly less than a coin toss' chance of having an overall satisfying experience.",

Tasted fresh and the crust has a nice flavor. We watched the dishes come out of the pen kitchen and everything looked fresh and tasty.  Portions are perfect for one person. The pizza is about 12 inches round. Great to share. The salads looked fresh.  Only down side is the noise level. The middle of the restaurant is one long table and it's difficult to hear the person sitting across from you. Will definitely be back.",

It's pretty small inside with about a dozen table around the outside with a large table that runs the length of the restaurant in the middle. I've only sat at the large table because I've always been with a large group. I like it!  The menu is a handful of great pasta dishes or wood fired pizza. The wood fired pizza is really good and there are a lot of choices to be had. My cousin said it best about the menu, she said that she could order anything on the menu and like it, and I agree.  The wait staff is nice and friendly and came by often to check on us. They have a BYOB policy and do charge a corking fee, so be aware. Great place, great atmosphere.l, and great food.

Ordered the mushroom pizza and the meat sauce pasta dish and the pizza came out cold, raw and slimy and the pasta was a bowl if tomato soup with meat floating. It was cold and tasteless  Even the broccoli was cold and hard. Not a good night. I was disappointed because it has been good in the past, but has been a while since there. Very disappointed.  .",

The Arrancini was about the best we've had. One of the entres, a spicy pasta, was pretty good, but the other chicken dish was too bland. It's a loud, open room and the menu is just pizza and pasta.

What was not understandable was the amount of time it took from ordering to getting our food. Over 2 hours! Not ok. The food was decent, but the wait ruined the evening for me. The staff was completely unapologetic. Strike 1.  The second time I attempted to give Mambo my money, I tried to call in an order for pick-up. I was told, \"We are really backed up and are not taking to-go orders.\" Really? There seems to be a theme developing. The kitchen is slow, very slow, to the point that they have to turn away business. The hostess didn't say, \"It will be a while to get your order prepared,\" which would have been an acceptable answer. She essentially said, \"We don't want your money.\" Strike 2!  The third and final time I tried to pay Mambo for a meal I went early on a Friday. Way early, in hopes to avoid the rush. I avoided the rush and the service was still very slow. The worst part of this dining experience was, however, the fact that they were having an AC unit serviced. The service tech, on a ladder over the pizza oven and food prep area, was spraying a chemical on the AC unit's coils and scrubbing them with a toothbrush. As pieces of god knows what were falling down to the food prep area, we called the manager over. Not only was it disgusting, we could smell the chemicals he was spraying. The manager claimed, \"There is nothing I can do about it.\" She passed the buck saying the owners ordered the unit cleaned...during business hours..with customers present...without covering the food prep area. Strike 3.  The food is decent and I'd give it 4 stars for food alone, but the poor management of this place - from back of house to front of house - drags this to a generous 2 stars. Avoid it...at least until it's inevitably replaced by a better run restaurant.",

It's amazing in summer when they open up the big garage door and it essentially becomes an outside cafe. Sitting at the bar is fun to watch them cook but the pizza oven makes it super hot. My only complaint: BYOB corkage feed is way too expensive at $8. But there is a wine store around the corner if you forget yours!",

    "text": "I brought my family to dine for dinner today.  The restaurant was packed. It took about an hour for the food to arrive. There were several other tables that were waiting just as long.  The waiter noted the kitchen was backed up because they had to cook three plates of their special (steak with truffle fries) for one table.  When our food finally arrived, I split my clams and linguine dish with my nine year old who noted that the noodle tasted funny. When I took a bite I realized the pasta was undercooked to a point that there were pieces of pasta stuck together.  I returned it to the kitchen and declined the offer for another plate to be prepared. The waiter noted they would not charge us the pasta dish. When the check arrived however they charged us for the pasta ($18) and credited us for the dessert ($7).  When we inquired about it, the waiter noted that their manager said since we took bites of the undercooked pasta we should be responsible to pay a portion of the dish. I could tell the waiter felt guilty but had no choice because it was the manager's decision.  After pushing back they finally credited us the pasta dish. I've been to Mambo Italia before and this has to be the worse food experience I've had.    Overall observation:  the food quality is below average when they are packed.  The best meal I had at Mambo Italia was when there were only a handful of customers at the restaurant.  For the past two months, I was going to Mambo weekly with my kids after school when it's slow but given the poor experience I had today, I don't think I will be returning for a while or if ever.  Recommendation: I would highly recommend avoiding the restaurant when it's packed, as I've had the consistent experience of long wait time with subpar food - so the wait is not worth it.  Give it a try when they are slower. And check your receipt if they promise to remove a charge because in the end you may still owe a portion of it based on the bites you took.",

    "text": "Choose this restaurant for a girlfriends birthday. The only thing positive was our server was very friendly. Not great experience on any level. The food was poor. I sent my $17 dollar chicken meal back because it was tasteless. However, prior to sending it back I asked for a side of Alfredo, that was not possible because \"the chef has to make it.\" I never send a meal back. At that time I had to, it was really tasteless. They came back and offered me \"the special\" which was an Alfredo with Gorgonzola and shrimp \"for free.\" Again the waiter Blaine was amazing and friendly, apologetic, ect- handled it well. I am allergic to shrimp so I declined. I find it interesting that the Alfredo was available \"with the special.\" But I couldn't have the meal bc my allergy- so it must be pre-made and waiting on an order on a warmer. Not really appropriate for the price point. The entire time is was miserable hot. I mean everyone was sweating. The temperature fluctuated A LOT, from uncomfortable warm to sweating hot. Then we get to the bill. We are a party of 9 sitting at the community table, this means seated with other parties. So we are informed that they refuse to split the bill - restaurant policy..... so if we sat this same table and claimed to come in party's of two there would have been no problem? The final kicker we attempt to split our giant bill with three cards, and they are unable to run that many cards. So they don't split bills, and they do not accept multiple cards.   As far as the other food the meatballs are delicious. The pizza was not worth 20 dollars. The pizza came uncut- we sent it back to be cut. It came back cut into 4 pizza. Which was not reasonable. We attempted to cut the pizza ourselves into normal portions, you need a chainsaw.   Disappointing. Will not return.",

    "text": "Great food. Terrible / inexcusable service.  Two weeks in a row. Never again!  Arrived at 4pm on Sunday. 1 couple ahead of us who were seated inside.  We had a group of 8. Asked to be seated outside / were willing to be split up and or to sit wherever was out of the way. No can do.   At least 3 high tops with four seats each sat empty the whole time. They were off to the side and not prepared for service but that was ok to us.  It could have been staffing related so willing to overlook this but have been turned away from table requests before and witnessed others being given the same response so it's not just us.   Never took drink order.  Glasses were dirty.  Asked if we could substitute spaghetti for the Penne pasta for a child thinking there was a child's menu answer was no. Asked if I could pay more for that answer was no. After all of that I don't think there is a kids menu so over a $2 difference between the spaghetti and meatballs to the plain Penne they could have just said we don't have a kids menu and that would have solved that request.   Next request was if we could get Alfredo sauce on the side of penne that came with one of the entrees. Offered to pay extra if needed. Nope can't do that either.   This is the third time here and two out of three times have had issues with service and management / ownership.  If you go in knowing 1. no substitutions and 2. no requests in general you will probably enjoy yourself.",

They have those Mitsubishi style a/c units in there and I can tell you - them suckers are not cutting it... We were all roasting, it's sad too cause they really do have good food and the service was good but it was so hot we couldn't enjoy it, it was bad enough that i wouldn't recommend going there in the summer unless they fix the A/C issue.

    "text": "We went to Mambo on Sunday and had a very poor experience. When we arrived the restaurant was not crowded and we were seated quickly. My wife ordered us a Burrata pizza and Arancini. We asked to make a substitute on the pizza from dried tomatoes to fresh cherry tomatoes. Our waiter said okay and then returned a few minutes later and said the owner won't let us make substitutes and he will get in trouble. (My wife has ordered this same pizza with alterations before). If I'm paying $20 for pizza, you should be VERY willing to make substitutions. My wife is from Italy and the original Burrata pizza has cherry tomatoes. Sorry for trying to be authentic. We waited 13 minutes before both the pizza and arancini came out (we were supposed to receive the arancini as an appetizer). Our waiter apologized and offered us a free dessert. 5 minutes later another waiter arrived to our table with some kind of salad. We told him we didn't order a salad and he left the table. Our original waiter returned again with the salad and asked if we were sure that we didn't order the salad. Again we said \"no\", and he said \"you ordered the buratta pizza and burrata salad\". There isn't even a buratta salad on the menu. We again told him we only ordered the burrata pizza and arancini. He left and went back to the kitchen and we could over hear him blaming my wife for the mistake. At the end of the meal our waiter asked what dessert we would like. We took the cheesecake. It was very dry and the spoons they gave us were giant, making it very difficult to eat.   I've heard great things about this place, but our experience was very disappointing, rude, and offensive. We were uncomfortable the entire meal. NOT RETURNING.",

I understand rules and business structures, but to not be able to be swap penne noodles for spaghetti noodles and Alfredo sauce for tomato sauce at an Italian restaurant, is odd to me. We offered to pay extra for the inconvenience.  We were told no!  In addition, I arrived at 3:45 for a 4:00 opening and waited for the restaurant to open. I asked to have two tables next to each other in the outside area. I did not ask to move the tables together or to make any changes to a seating plan that is already established. We were told no. There were only two other families at the restaurant during our entire visit.   In addition, from a prior review given, a response was given and asked if our group was interested in raising our children correctly. I can guarantee you, I have raised my children correctly and they were nothing but respectful during our visit.   My children commented, we get treated better at the Olive Garden! And I agree!",

You could taste the eggs they coated the chicken in and it was burnt. Very disappointed.  My mother in law got the chicken piccata. It was overcooked.

    "text": "I desperately want to like this place, but they have made it too difficult.  Here's a brief synopsis of my last three visits:  Visit #1: The restaurant was quite busy.  It took 2 hours and 10 minutes from the time we place our order until our food arrived.  That's not a two-hour wait to get a table but a two-hour wait after we put in our order.  Two.  Hours.  The food was fine, but after that wait, the experience was completely ruined.  Visit #2: The restaurant was almost empty.  (There were three other people dining.)  The wait this time was a mere hour.  One hour to make two pizzas in a nearly empty restaurant.    Visit #3: Not only did the food take forever, but there was someone repairing the air conditioner right above the food prep area.  He was brushing out the air conditioning unit and cleaning it was a solvent RIGHT ABOVE where the food was being prepared.  (See the picture above.) I spoke to the manager who told me the the food prep area was covered.  I walked over to look and it was not, never mind the fact the restaurant smelled liked the solvent the guy was using.  Then the manager told me that she had only been there for two weeks and that there was nothing she could do about it.    Both the front of house and back of house seem completely inept.  It's too bad, too.  The food is pretty good but they seem indifferent to good customer service.",

Lightly breaded and crisp on the outside, super cheesy and creamy on the inside.  For dinner wife had the margherita pizza and of course I swiped a piece.  We're pizza snobs and this was up there with some of the better ones (dare I say reminded me a bit of pizza taglio).  Dough and crust were crunchy yet chewy, sauce and cheese spot on.  Forgot to ask for well done but will next time.  I got the shrimp scampi special.  Again, wow.  Plenty of nice sized shrimp, the pasta tasted homemade and had a great al dente bite but the sauce, my god the sauce was light, refreshing and absolutely delicious!  Definitely stopping there again, it's made the list!",

We waited a little longer than I would of liked for the food but we came to find out it was because they remade our pizza because they felt it wasn't good enough for us. The seating is a little odd with a large part of it being a sort of community table in the middle of the restaurant. The booth seating is very \"friendly\" too. We will go back for sure but maybe when we can get a less social seating arrangement. Oh and we strongly recommend utilizing the No Wait app.",

    "text": "Probably some of the best pizza that I have had outside of Italy, especially the crust which has a great wood-fired taste, but the prices are shockers especially considering the pizza sizes.  That would be tolerable if it weren't for the corkage charge of $8/bottle when there are good wines to be had for $10/bottle and the nearby liquor store.  I'm a firm believer that corkage charges should be to offset the cost of cleaning and maintaining the stemware and it certainly didn't cost $16 to clean three glasses.  For three of us, who had three pizzas, a salad and parts of two bottles of wine (using the same glasses) and \"community seating\" the cost was over $100. There are better places to spend that kind of money.",

    "text": "I don't really get the bad reviews of this place. I stopped here for take-out on my way home one night. I'd been meaning to try it out because an Italian friend of mine likes it and I figured that was a good sign. The restaurant is small, bistro-like, with modern decor. Really cute, I'd love to actually dine in at some point. There were some families there with small kids as well as adults-only tables. It is BYOB. I got the special: pan roasted chicken over linguine with sun dried tomato cream sauce. It took ten minutes (I hadn't called ahead, just showed up in my gym clothes, sneakers, and parka, they were super-nice about it). It was expensive (close to 20 dollars) BUT this is home made pasta with home made sauce and fresh chicken. Hence the price. You get what you pay for and this was worth the money. It isn't the type of thing I can afford all the time unfortunately, but I did get two meals out of the portion size. My only complaint is that they didn't include a vegetable with the meal and don't have side orders of vegetables. They have beans and greens and salads which cost around seven to nine dollars (They looked quite lovely. I didn't order one because I was going home and figured I could just make one myself).   One aside for reviewers who have complained about the menu: this is Neapolitan Italian food not Sicilian Italian food. They are both \"real\" Italian, just different cuisines from different regions of Italy. Neapolitan has more cream sauces, white wine, and long pasta. If you want red sauce on everything you want Sicilian. Bread is not normally served with meals in Italy as the pasta or pizza is your carbohydrate. Also Sewickley is an affluent area and the rents reflect that fact. The cost of the space gets passed on to customers in the menu prices. When you factor that in along with the quality of ingredients that are used, I don't think their prices are unfair.",

Visited last week and the inside of the restaurant was warm, then they opened the front sidewalk \"garage type\" door and it got really warm in the restaurant. Opening that door to accommodate three tables on the sidewalk didn't seem like a good trade since it became really warm inside. 2. There was a keyboard player playing inside the restaurant. It made the atmosphere louder and the music being played didn't add to the atmosphere at all. It actually was a bit of an odd choice of music. I would eliminate the keyboard player. 3. I hate when our server (Cassandra) didn't write down our order (party of 5). She forgot my salad.  Please write it down, especially when you are busy. 4. I had the veal Marsala. The veal was not tender at all, it was very tough.",

My boyfriend and I have gone three times now and request to sit at the bar-- you seem so involved watching them cook. The service is amazing. We were never left unsatisfied while the cooks, waitresses and the owner asked about our food, always made sure we had a full glass and clean plates for every course. The pizza, salad, appetizers and desserts are all beautiful and delicious. Both Doug and Kevin that work on the oven are so sweet and cook the pizza to perfection. This is one lucky restaurant to have such great people! Our waitresses (though I don't remember names but one was the owners daughter) were so attentive and so helpful.

But the food is what was really worth writing about. We started with the arancini which was seasoned perfectly and had a great balance of crispy and creamy. The bolognese sauce served with the arancini was unbelievable and full of flavor. We were literally eating the sauce with spoons after the arancini was gone. Next we shared the shrimp scampi pasta and the Mambo pizza. The pasta was packed with large sauteed shrimp and covered in a light, buttery garlic sauce. The pizza was everything pizza should be-- crispy, chewy and cheesy with a fresh tomato sauce, salty prosciutto and peppery arugula. We finished our meal with coffee and the tiramisu which did not disappoint. Light and creamy, a perfect end to an amazing meal. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more items on the menu!",

    "text": "Love the atmosphere and the service was fine.  The wife ordered wedding soup and a margarita pizza.  I didn't try the soup but the pizza was fine.   I wanted a salad with ranch dressing - but they don't have ranch so I passed.  I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce ($12) and asked that they add some chicken.   When I got the bill - they chicken was $6.   Adding 50% to the price of the entree seems excessive.   Even with the chicken- the pasta had zero taste.   The bill for 2 of us with the corkage fee for 1 bottle of wine and tip was $55.   Seems pretty step for what we got.  No rush to return.",

    "text": "The good -   Pizza ingredients were VERY fresh and the pizza was \"light\". The portions were good but you did not feel like you had eaten a brick when you were done.  Some have complained about the price, but I felt the prices were fair considering the freshness of the ingredients.  The decor is nice (my fiancee says it's \"just like if Pinterest opened a restaurant)  Polite, efficient server  The Bad -   It's LOUD. Crazy loud. We were seated across from one another at a very small table and eventually gave up speaking to one another as it was just too loud to hear.  Crowded. When we were there, there were only maybe 5 or 6 empty seats and, to be honest, the place was already at about 10 or 12 more people than it could comfortably handle. We felt crammed in like sardines and heaven help you if you're seated at the long bench/chair combo section against the wall and the person seated behind you at the long table in the middle of the room needs to get up a lot. Your chairs are going to collide every time.  Long wait time between ordering and receiving the food. We waited almost 40 minutes. The couple next to us (who ordered BEFORE us) waited even longer.  They ran out of Coke while we were there. Not a huge issue, but that's the first time that's ever happened to me. I just found it odd.  8$ uncorking fee PER BOTTLE of wine.   Over-all, I would not go back. The pizza, while very fresh (and not overly expensive in my opinion), was very bland.  Add to that  the excessive noise (they really need to look into some noise dampening) and borderline claustrophobic conditions and I just don't think this place is for me.",

    "text": "First let me say that I agreed with the other reviewers up until my last dinner there.  To start, we had salads which ranged from just ok to pretty good.  I too had the linguine and clam sauce when I was there shortly after they opened and it was fantastic. I ordered it again and it was terrible! Overly salted and it has a ton of  pancetta (bacon) in it.  It didn't have bacon the first time that I had it. If this was intended to elevate the dish, it achieved the exact opposite. Last time I checked bacon does not belong in linguine and clam sauce. Plus, it was gummy. I love that they are using homemade pasta, it just needs to be executed properly. My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs. I CAN'T adequately describe how bad it was. It tasted like water. ZERO flavor. It didn't even have the taste of tomato and had no seasoning/salt whatsoever. It was odd tasting. We had a bit of the sauce on the side and sent it around the table for a taste test. We all agreed and all of us were perplexed.  How can you mess up basic tomato sauce??  The meatball lacked flavor as well. The pizzas are under done.  Plus, they also don't serve bread which I think is odd for an Italian restaurant. With that said, my daughter's bolognese was good the first time. I'm confused. DId they change chefs in the last two weeks?  I will say that they did an excellent job with the decor.  It's rustic chic. There are garage doors that open-perfect for a warm evening. I like that they are BYOB.   Now, I'm not excited to write negative reviews. I just want them to succeed and serve good Italian food. Selfishly, I was excited to have another restaurant in the area.  Please be consistent!! Taste your food and don't put out anything substandard or people won't come back.  Hopefully, you are still working out the kinks. However, please don't change what's working!  I'm going to give Mambo another chance but I'm now skeptical.",

My wife is a fourth generation Italian American and her ancester would roll over at what they called Italian cooking.  The noise level was excusiating, they payed Italian music so loud that everyone  had to talk louder to be heard over it. Nice yuppie atmosphere...but if you're  going to call it an Italian  restaurant....make some Italian  food. Revise your memu and I'll  consider coming back...if not, it's  a one time shot.",

The servers brought over three wine glasses and all three were filthy, along with the also dirty flatware. I asked my server for new wine glasses and he returned with three more dirty wine glasses. Mine had lipstick on it. I told my server that these were also dirty. The owner came over with three more that had greasy fingerprints on them. Rather than apologize and bring three clean glasses, the owner said that the greasy fingerprints were mine. Poor customer service. After two complaints he should have washed them himself, but he was in denial. Otherwise the restaurant was pretty. The food was average although the pasta was cooked nicely el dente. The waiters were very inexperienced. They hovered and did not offer ground pepper or bread. Our salads and entrees came out all at the same time. Ghastly pink t shirts were worn by the staff.",
