They should have somehting in 10-15 minutes, and she would go check. She disappeared for 45 minutes!! No tables, but she didn't want to tell us. When I asked to speak with the manager, I was told that he was out running errands and wouldn't be back for a couple of hours. How can you justify the manager being gone during dinner rush? Know what the worst part was? No one ever once said \"I'm Sorry\"...that would have went a long way. Long-time customer will never go back",

I think they were trying to pass off the tablespoon of yellow liquid on the veal as hollandaise sauce.  The steak was fair.  If you want a quality steak you better head to Longhorn.  This was an overpriced dinner.  They should also think of investing in a decorator.  The dining room could use some wall decor.  Note to owner:  Pittsburgh is filled with wonderful artist. Go out on a sat to the artist market up there and buy something.  Not all your tables have the view of the city, give these people something to look at while they are waiting for their overpriced meal.",

Our waitress was accommodating when I was served sour wine but then dropped the ball when she brought the 18$ appetizer out with our entree. Last, the food was meh.

    "text": "I created an account so I could share the bad experience I had at Grandview Saloon.  Yesterday was my wife and I's first anniversary.  We decided we would go up to Mt. Washington and stare at the city while we eat/drink for our special occasion.  Monday, my wife called and made reservations for Thursday at 7:30pm and requested a table by the windows.  She was told that it wasn't a problem but there might be a 5-10 minute wait for a window table even with a reservation.  That' was no problem.  Being the punctual person that I am, I was walking through the door at 7:30pm.  Told the hostess that we were there for our reservations.  This is where it gets bad.   We were told that the people who had reservations at 6:30pm still haven't arrived and that we no longer have the option for a window table.  She told us they were a whopping HOUR late for their reservation.  She explained that the group was from Philly and got lost and stuck in traffic.  Who in the hell continues to hold a reservation when the group is over an HOUR late?  My wife was pretty disappointed considering we made reservations four days prior.  As for the food, it was pretty mediocre.  Lets just say you're not going for the food.  You're going for the view.  I got the homemade crab cake dinner with a Caesar salad and steak fries.  My wife got the salmon dinner with a side salad and french fries.  My wife said the salmon was pretty decent.  They had to send my plate back because someone plated the wrong sides with my crab cakes.  For being about $30 a plate, I expected the food to be a lot better.  As stated before and by a lot of other people.  Don't set your expectations high on anything other than the view.  That's what you're going there for.  I want to send a shout out to the group from Philly who arrived an hour late for their reservation and messing up mine.",

We arrived right on time, but the hostess said that we would have to wait for a while since all their  reservations were behind from much much earlier in the day. We ended up waiting for over a half an hour. By the time we were seated, our waitress seemed very much disinterested in us. Food was quite delicious, but not before several of us were served plates of pasta that were cold. They had to have been sitting out for at least 20 minutes to be that cold to be honest. The food is good, but there are many places in the city that serve food just as well if not better and have good service on top. I would honestly think twice about eating here again.",

I have worked in the hospitality business for approximately 20 years and have never heard of such a thing. Pretty sure it's illegal.

The view is insane.  If you get there around the time of the sunset which we were lucky enough to do, it is spectacular.  The food was pretty good as well.  I got the coconut chicken and potatoes which was excellent and a unique option.  My boyfriend got the stuffed chicken parm (which wasn't really stuffed, it was pretty much 2 pieces of chicken parm with ricotta cheese sandwiched in the middle) but either way he enjoyed it.  The grilled chicken nachos were awesome as well.    The only thing I have to say to people going there is that beware that there are two inclines; the one that you take from Station Square, the Monongahela Incline, doesn't bring you near this restaurant.  The other incline, the Duqesne Incline brings you right by it.  We didn't know this and took the Monongahela Incline up and we did walk to the restaurant but it was a bit of a long walk on a hilly road.    Overall it was a great experience and one of the best parts of our trip!",

Multiple people ordered a special that came out cold and raw in the middle. They slammed the food down in front of people and were unapologetic about it.  The drinks too forever to arrive and they even told us that they didn't put the order in until over 10 minutes after we gave our orders. They kept excusing the delay by telling us that they were packed - something that was NOT reflected in the amount of people around us. It took so long for them even to take our orders and the food took an unreasonable amount of time to come out.  There was nothing redeeming about the visit except the view. I would avoid at all costs and would never recommend this place to anyone. They were unprofessional to a degree I have rarely experienced.",

We had a party of nine and of all of the meals, only one was really worth mentioning, which were the scallops. The ribeye steak was overcooked, the mahi-mahi was also overcooked and dry. They also charged an additional eight dollars for two young children to split one meal, which was a $26 plate of salmon.  Again you can't beat the view, it was absolutely beautiful but this place is absolutely not worth the prices that they are charging. Even when we had a problem with our food and asked for a manager, we were told there wasn't even a manager on site and it was a Saturday evening.  You can definitely find a better!",

OK, OK, I'll admit that when I first entered the place, I was concerned by the decor as well. A glance at the enormous menu offering what appeared to be a mundane slew of tired old \"American Food\" items left me a bit melancholy as well. I think that I am a bit less critical because these two first impressions set the bar a little low for me.  BUT... the draft beer was nice and cold, the staff working up on the deck that night were very attentive and friendly, and the gyro I ordered was... AWESOME! (One of the wait staff recommended it, saying it was probably the best thing on the menu.) Forget $50 porterhouse steaks here - why the hell would you do that? Go to Morton's, Capital Grille, or Ruth's Chris if you want to spend a fistful of money on some muscle to gnaw on.  I would disagree with the 5 star (?!?!) and 1 star reviews here. This place isn't The French Laundry on Mount Washington OR Pittsburgh Food Hell Meets Third World Inflation... It is a place with a great view and some tasty items you have to sort out from the rest of the \"Bennigan's meets TGI Friday's meets Applebee's meets Bar Food\" stuff. If you have the time and the patience, give the place a try if you are in the vicinity. Hopefully you will visit on a good night, and the view will make up for most of the shortcomings you may encounter.  And remember to set your expectations appropriately - the Michelin reviewers will never set foot in this place. You know that. Sites like this can help too - read what people are saying...",

The patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.

We ordered the coconut shrimp, which was over fried, but fortunately served with a tasty sauce which helped.  We also had the spinach dip, which was served with a great warm pita bread.  The cheese plate had a nice variety of cheese and crackers, served with a spicy mustard sauce.  Overall, nice experience, since we did it for the view, but prices are way high, so not a place I would ever go just to have a meal.",

Everything was about $15 more expensive and the things I wanted were off the menu. The jalapeno crab dip was exceptional and I wish that is all I ordered.   Our server was ok and wasn't that talkative at all. I had the stuffed shrimp which ended up being just shrimp with crab on top. I had a side of the roasted potatoes. They were only 4......yeah; and they were cold and barely seasoned.   overall it could be a very good restaurant but the portions are very small compared to the price. The experience did not match the price either. If you come back get the jalapeno dip and leave.   The drink menu was very limited also. Not a good look.",

My wife and daughter wanted to share a pizza but was advised that an $8 sharing fee would be applied. For another 6 bucks,  we just ordered another pizza. It was extremely hot as it felt as though the air conditioning was not working.  We were seated far from the windows overlooking the city so my view of the soda machines were awesome.

    "text": "I have read numerous reviews of the Grandview Saloon before I decided to take my son there for his birthday. Stupidly, I chose to ignore the reviews and advice of coworkers and head there for the celebration. What a mistake I made! The food was mediocre at best. Our waitress, Danielle was very friendly, which we found out later was tip motivated. My sister and her husband asked for a separate check and Danielle told her it would not be a problem. The prices are outrageous not even justified by the view. First, I ordered the jalapeno crab dip, which had wonderful reviews on trip advisor and yelp. It was good and quite spicy but keep in mind, it is not lump crabmeat. The consistency of the crab appeared ground, which I would compare to canned tuna. I ordered the Prime Steak Sandwich, which was so tough, I had to eat it with a steak knife and fork. My son ordered the Porterhouse steak, which came with asparagus and he chose, fries. He also got a Caesar salad with blackened tuna. He said it was very good but the tuna did not appear to be blackened at all. I was surprised that bread was not served his meal. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger, which was supposed to be topped with battered jalapeno's. The jalapeno's were not battered but appeared to be pulled right out of a can or jar. After we ate, we sat and sat and sat, waiting for Danielle to stop by our table so we could ask for our check. After we asked for our check again, we sat and sat and sat. Finally, we found 30 minutes was entirely too long to wait for our check so, we headed toward the bar and asked the bartender for our check. Danielle then came out from the kitchen and upon seeing us, decided to figure out our check. She gave us our check and when I looked at it, I could not believe how high it was. After scanning the charges, I realized that they had put my sister and husband's meal on our check. I told her that we were to have two checks. She went back to the computerized check/cash register and \"supposedly\" fixed both of our bills. I paid for our meal, gave her a 20% tip, and we left the restaurant feeling a bit used and unfulfilled by the meal we just ate. While walking to our car, we stopped to read the menu posted outside of the Bella Vista Italian Restaurant. Feeling stupid for choosing the Grandview Saloon over Bella Vista was consuming my thoughts for I had eaten there before and it was truly spectacular. When we got home, my sister took another look at her bill. She discovered that they charged her for some of what me, my husband and son had. Danielle took it upon herself to split the crab dip between the two of us. They did not order the crab dip and had no right to have them pay for half. They also put our soda on their bill. My sister called to tell them about their error. She asked for the manager and told the so-called manager about the bill errors, she put her on hold and put the waitress Danielle on the phone. My sister explained the over charges and Danielle proceeded to argue with her, telling her that her husband did have a soda. My sister told her that her husband had two drafts, no soda. She continued to argue with my sister about her husband having a soda. Her solution was to have me call so I could give her my credit card so that she could bill me for the remaining 1/2 order of the jalapeno dip and credit my sister. We were shocked at this solution. I could not believe that she had the audacity to make this request. This for me, was a first. My sister told her that she was not going to argue with her about the soda. She said okay and hung up. After overhearing this conversation, I decided to call back and let them know what horrible customer service they have. I asked for a manager. Funny, but there were no managers there at that time and would not be until the next day. This made me realize that someone was posing as a manager when my sister called. The following day, I decided to call and talk to a manager. Unfortunately, there were no managers available and instead, I got the bartender supervisor. After telling him everything that had happened, he like Danielle argued with me about my sister's husband getting a soda. I thought to my self, you have got to be kidding me. So, in conclusion is the view good? Everyone talks about the view on the many reviews I read, which is quite nice. But keep in mind, if you sit on the patio, you will be packed in like sardines and unless you sit next to the railing, the view is not that visible. My advice to all of you Mount Washington diners, go somewhere else if you want good food that is worth the money. If you want a view, enjoy the many lookouts across Mount Washington. Don't waste your time or money on the Grandview Saloon.",

The prices are a bit higher but again the location fee is built into your meal. I shared the pulled pork nachos with my companions and was pleasantly surprised by the dish.

I think everyone in Pittsburgh or visiting Pittsburgh must visit this place once, but remember to make a reservation for the windows seats. They are in high demand.",

Odd combination, but so were chicken wings and bbq sauce in Buffalo in the 70s! My husband had the sausage sub -- to fat to pick up! We were there early on a Saturday on a chilly day in April and could just imagine how fun it would be to eat outside.",

    "text": "I grew up in Pittsburgh and now live in Georgia.  When I come home I quite often make a trip up the Duquesne incline and eat at the Grandview Saloon.  So, when I was on an executive board that was planning a conference in Pittsburgh and we needed a cool place to take 35 life members for lunch I immediately thought of the Grandview saloon.   The all glass front overlooking the Point and three rivers convergence is spectacular in itself.    Sue was great to work with from the start.   The day arrived and everything was perfect!   The food was excellent.  The group had Reuben's, crab cakes, fried Cod sandwiches, pear salads, etc.   EVERYTHING was excellent to a tee! Not one complaint from this vocal group!  The only thing I'd change was the requirement of one check for the group   Since we were doing this dutch treat This could have been a nightmare (I brought extra cash just in cash we were short). But we came out within 60 cents of the total bill!  That was a first! (Grin)   I was so pleased I brought the executive board back for dinner on Friday night to celebrate a successful conference. The brightly lit city was beautiful, Including a full moon which i ordered just for us!  Again, it was excellent with no complaints from this very tired group!   Crab cakes, gyros, Reuben's, Etc were all good.  The mushroom soup was a Gilled masterpiece, that with a salad, could have been a meal in itself.  We had two waiters for the 35 people and they kept in top of things well!   Couldn't have asked for a better experience either time!   I won't hesitate to go back next time im in town!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place! VERY RARELY DO I GIVE A NOT SO FLATTERING REVIEW BUT:  I called for a reservation and the man that answered the phone was extremely nice. He told me the Patio Seating was first come/first serve. Since it has been inclement weather, I got a reservation for window seating for 7PM. When we arrived, the Hostess told us our table would be ready in a few minutes. She came into the bar to tell us it would be a little longer. That was fine. The view is gorgeous and we took some beautiful pictures of Pittsburgh. The Hostess brought us to our table and that's when everything went SOUTH. Our Waitress, Kayla, wanted to go home apparently. She asked if we were OK with water (that was already on our table) but we wanted a drink from the bar and to enjoy the moment.  We lived in Pittsburgh for a while and we were back in town to do some renovations. We worked very hard for over a month and this was to celebrate our hard work was finally finished. Kayla brought our drinks, asked if we were ready to order...we knew we wanted the French Onion Soup (DELICIOUS) so we started with that. She came out of the kitchen with a tray on her shoulder and our soup in her hand. As she passed our table, she handed the soup to my husband and kept going. Well OK, she had her hands full but this isn't Carson Street!!  My husband had a few sips and passed it to me to try when Kayla walked over and asked if we were ready to order our food yet. I had just taken one spoonful of the soup and I said no but my husband said yes...Kayla ignored me so he ordered. (What waitress takes an order when the entire party isn't ready? Yes, there were only two of us but 50% of us were not ready. OK move on!) By this time, I was getting upset since we came for a nice relaxing evening only to be rushed. We ordered the $50. Porterhouse Steak (MEH- just OK, not  what I was hoping for) and a Crab Cake sandwich (since there is an $8.00 Sharing charge we got both items). I caught her on her way by to ask for some bread. When she brought it, she asked \"How is your food tasting?\" WHAT? Who says that? Then she started sweeping the carpet around us while we were eating. GROSS!! Our bill was well over $150.00 after parking and the bar bill. I asked for a doggy bag for the steak bone and Kayla handed me a little styrofoam box. I asked her if she had anything bigger but no. Weird...you sell a 24 oz. Porterhouse. It is such a shame that this one waitress spoiled the whole experience. If she wanted to go home she should have gone! Is there any FINE DINING in Pittsburgh?? Kayla should work on Carson Street where no one cares if you sweep under their feet. We thought this would be special but it was very disappointing...and all because we had a rude waitress. Too Bad! My husband still tipped her, his usual, over 20% because he worked in the restaurant industry. The thing is, even though we don't live here anymore, we still have a voice; Thanks to Yelp!! Also, we don't have small kids but if you do: ASK ABOUT THE NO KIDS POLICY BEFORE YOU GO!! I gave them 3 Stars...one for the guy on the phone, one for the Hostess and one for the view!",

    "text": "Five girlfriends and I chose this restaurant as the starting point for a \"girls night out\" mostly because we wanted the view of Mt. Washington and the experience of riding the incline to/from and it was less expensive and more casual than many other restaurants on Grandview Ave. Well, it's True what they say - you get what you pay for. In general, this place seems to be confused about its persona. It kind of WANTS to be a fancy restaurant with the white linen tablecloths and tiny candle lamps on the tables, but there is very little ambiance beyond the view of downtown Pittsburgh. Even the menu is confusing. There seems to be a strange mix of \"fancy\" dishes and more low-key items such as sandwiches and wraps. The latter would seem appropriate on a lunch menu, but for dinner, I think they should stick to seafood and pasta, and apparently steak, since it's technically a steak house, or at least was in the recent past. (I don't eat steak, so if it was on the menu, I would've skiipped right past it anyway.) The menu was also small - perhaps only 15-20 total choices? Not one person at my table said that they LOVED their meal, leaving me to conclude that they don't really put much effort into their offerings. In my opinion, if you're going to have a limited menu, that's fine - choose a few select dishes and do them REALLY well. A smattering of mediocre choices does not make up for the rest that this place is lacking. Our server was very personable, but I believe overworked, (which is hard to understand, since the place isn't very big), which lead to an overall impression of not-that-great service. We had to wait quite a while for drinks, had to ask for the complimentary bread that we spied on other tables, and had to ask to have our tabletop candle lamp lit at dusk. Turns out, there wasn't even a candle in it - apparently they're just set on the tables for show. He did, however, graciously take back a glass of wine one friend did not like and replaced it with a much better selection. And upon overhearing another friend complain about not even being able to cut her tuna steak with a butter knife (it should not need a knife at all), he offered to have the kitchen prepare her a new meal and asked to take back the half of hers that was overdone so they could see just what was wrong with it. Overall, I will not be in a hurry to go back to this place for anything other than drinks on the outside patio if I happen to be in the area.",

On this particular Sunday, we travelled up the Monongahela Incline, and walked the approximately one mile to this restaurant next to the Duquesne Incline as we like the viewing stands near the Monongahela but like this particular restaurant to enjoy the view.    It was surprising that at 11:50am on a Sunday with high 70's temperatures and partly sunny skies, there was not one person already outside on the terrace.  For that matter, there was not one person inside on that level, either.  No matter.  Good for us to have our choice of tables right next to the rail and views.  Our server was attentive, pleasant, and efficient without being intrusive to our chatter and experience.  As usual, we brought an out-of-town guest here to bask in the Pittsburgh scenery.  We opted for drinks and appetizers this go-round and they all hit the spot and were both flavorful and eye-catching.  We ordered some hummus and pita, as well as the jalapeno crab dib and pita.  Definitely winners.",

I was with a party of 12, and I was the only one who got what they ordered (which I'm not complaining about). I've worked in a lot of kitchen settings in the past, so I get it.

We rode the Duquesne incline up from Station Square and nabbed the last table by the windows, even though we didn't have a reservation. The wait staff seemed harried but nice. We enjoyed our pear and spinach salads (MIL didn't like the dressing as much as I did), Rueben, and burger. The fries in particular were a big hit. Prices are a little high, but that goes with the view. We may come back in the summer to sit out on the deck.",

We ordered the Grandview gyro, made not from gyro meat but from slow roasted leg of lamb. The gyro was wonderful. The Tzaziki  sauce fresh made. Unbelievably flavourful. We also had a Ruben sandwich. Thick sliced marble   piled high with lean corned beef, sauerkraut and topped with thousand island dressing. We also had a bowl of tomato bisque. Thick and creamy. The Grandview lives up to its name but also has great menu offerings.",

They moment I walked into the restaurant my first thought was \"am I in a Chinese restaurant\"? The set up makes no sense! Why you would have an \"upscale\" restaurant with sketchy random cabinets that almost look like they are in a laundromat in the middle of the room with multiple guest tables and bright florescent lighting is beyond me..... As my group sat down by the window with a great view, they all made similar comments. We decided to give it a try and not judge a book by its cover. That is until our waiter came..... Jesus Christ, I wish I would have got this guy's name because he should definitely choose a different career and the owner needs to know that! From the get go, he was so rude. We orders waters while we all looked at the menu for other drinks. Great job by him, he brought the waters quickly. But that's about where his good service stopped. We asked for a couple more minutes to review the menu and he gave us exactly one minute. He seemed very irritated. After we told him to give us more time he came back within literally seconds and at this point we started to get frustrated with him. He asked him a couple of questions about the restaurant and then asked for 5 more minutes for our group of 5 to review the menu more. He gave us about 30 seconds this time. At this point we got up and left. When we told him why we were leaving he said \"good because I was tired anyways\".... Are you Fu**ing kidding me!? Awful service and unfortunately we didn't get to taste the food or the drinks. From that experience I will never be back nor will I recommend this restaurant. Plenty of other good places to visit.",

I wasn't too hungry, so I thought I would get the \"artisanal cheese and fruit plate\". Cheese plates are my default choice at somewhat upscale-restaurants. To my dismay, this is what I received: cheddar cubes, old/brown grapes and a hunk of greek yogurt cheese. Unacceptable. Only come to the Grandview Saloon for the view and overpriced drinks.",

We sat in the downstairs area which was awesome because we where right up against the window, and that's what really sets this place up.  The views of the city at night are absolutely amazing! We had a larger group of ten but the waitress was great and handled it with ease. She kept the drinks flowing and everyone was happy. The food was great and everyone at the table liked what they had. My wife splurged and got the New York strip. It was pricey but she absolutely loved it. I had the stuffed chicken Parmesan and it was delicious.   The only complaint we had was the the bar downstairs was closed. Not the worst but would have been nice to stay after the meal and have a few drinks.",

It seems this establishment is suffering from inexperience in both the wait and kitchen staff during our late afternoon visit (4:00 P.M.) Our Jalepeno Crab Dip appetizer was delicious and served in a timely manner..but our French Onion soup never arrived! Our dinners were sub-par.  My husband's Pittsburgh Chicken Salad arrived with a live fruit fly, but being a guy he just removed it rather than wait for a replacement...gross! This made me question the kitchen conditions. My burger was not prepared as ordered, med. well..it was very well done and dry. After asking the waiter twice for ketchup it finally arrived, on the upside the onion rings were hot and delicious. Our guest who requested a return visit to this establishment couldn't wait to order the spectacular Seafood Scampi... she was solely disappointed with her choice on this visit..although the seafood in the dish was prepared to perfection...the scampi sauce was pasty and the pasta was over cooked. nothing like the delightful dish she experienced on her last visit. It was a huge disappointment at a premium price!  I will think twice about revisiting the Grandview Saloon...hopefully they can get their act together again!",

It is not as ritzy as the Lemont or somewhere similar, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed.  My wife and I are both too loud to enjoy places like that anyways.  However, we do enjoy good food and a good atmosphere.  We like places that have bar food, but sometimes want something a little better.  This place is perfect for that.    Another one of my favorite things about the place is how diverse the menu is.  It is rare to find a place that has a menu with both a $12 sandwich and a $50 steak.  Whether you want a juicy steak or a simple sandwich, everything is prepared wonderfully and tastes great.  Some of my favorite things to get here are the buffalo chicken dip, buffalo chicken sandwich, grandview burger, Crab sandwich, and the ribeye filet.  I have never been disappointed with any meal here.  On top of the great food, you cannot beat the atmosphere, especially in the summer when the decks are open.  The views are amazing and make for a great experience.",

    "text": "The deck at Grandview Saloon has the best view of the city for sure!! I will only go if I can sit outside, and I will only go for drinks only. I actually ate before I left the house because I knew I didn't want to eat there lol. The food is not that great, but it is very expensive. $14 for a burger and $19 for a crab dip appetizer! You also have to hike up 2 flights of stairs to get to the restrooms. Also, this place can be hard to find because the outside is labeled Coal Hill Steakhouse... not Grandview Saloon (not sure what that's about lol) However, I still had a nice time on the deck! I was there with a party of 10 and the service was very good! The tables are bolted to the deck so we couldn't move them, but we kept taking chairs and moving them around a big table, and no one seemed to mind. There was a team of 2 servers, and they both worked diligently to refill our waters and replace our beers!  I'm sure I will be spending many summer afternoons to come on the deck of Grandview Saloon!",

The prices are on the high side, but for that view, it was totally worth it. The inside could use some updating, but it totally fits the Pittsburgh vibe. This was my second visit, and I'll be back! The only bad thing is the terrifying drive up! Being from the Midwest, I'm not accustomed to those steep streets. I wouldn't do it in the winter. If it's a nice day out, I highly suggest parking below and taking the incline railroad up!",

    "text": "Get ready for this review. My party had made a reservation here for prom night (remember this) because of the stellar view and the expectation that the food would be relatively cheaper than that of the surrounding restaurants. First off, when we arrived at the restaurant, it was empty in the upstairs dining room, yet they still would not seat our entire party together, despite the fact that there was clearly plenty of room. The restaurant in general felt off to me, as the furniture was outdated, tacky, and basic. There were several bugs flying about as well, which would be unsettling for any diner. The silverware was clearly not entirely clean, as it appeared smudged, and mine had traces of crumbs and other food particles on it. The options on the menu seemed decent, but they were EXTREMELY overpriced for the actual quality of the food. In that moment, I thought to myself how we could have dined at one of the luxury restaurants in the surrounding area for approximately the same price, but much higher quality food. HERE IS WHERE IT GETS GROSS, SAD, AND SHAMEFUL!!! We arrived at the prom and had only been there about 15 minutes before someone in our party threw up multiple times, and another one began to have stomach pains. Unfortunately, due to the low quality and disgusting food at this establishment, she had to leave her senior prom before the night even took off. The next morning, another person in our party was complaining of extreme stomach pains and fear of vomit to come. That is when we decided to call the restaurant to let them know of this incident, and potentially ask for some money back, as each couple had to pay $80 for food poisoning. When we called (multiple of us did), the staff was incredibly rude, stating that we could not claim they suffered from a food illness unless they went to the hospital. They also claimed that the health inspector \"was just there\" without giving any specific dates. They were not understanding or sympathetic towards our situation, and instead tried to make themselves the victims in this situation. We will NEVER EVER return to this establishment, instead we will remember it as the place that ruined prom! Please, don't come here, spare your wallets, pride, and stomachs :)",

Our waitress Brittany was rude from the beginning, she did not introduce herself, sat down two waters and walked away after we said we didn't want a menu. After ordering an appetizer and dinner the service unfortunately went downhill even more. When we asked to speak to the manager her response was \"this is what you get\" meaning herself. We were able to speak to the bar manager who was argumentative and aggressive towards us. As a previous restaurant employee I can tell you firsthand that should not be tolerated. After explaining for the third time the reasons we were unhappy we were told we could pay the bill and take the food to go. After some more go around the untouched food was comped and we paid for our appetizer and left. But not before being threatened to have the police come because we were refusing to pay. I kindly explained I'm more than happy to pay for the food we consumed and that wasn't good enough. All in all I'd say if you're looking for a place with a truly great view, go here. But if service, hospitality or respect from management or staff is important find another establishment to go to immediately",

Night spot for a drink/lunch/dinner.  2) wait staff - friendly and attentive  3) the view - you have a world class view of the downtown/north shore area.  In my opinion nice spot for a happy hour drink but I would grab food elsewhere.",

My girlfriend and I sat down at 8pm for dinner and enjoyed the view for 20 minutes before our waiter JT came over to take our drink orders. We ordered caprese and french onion soup to start.  The pesto caprese was good but the slices of tomatoes were uneven cut (wedge cut), staked on top of eachother so the balsamic wasnt even on the bottom two slices of tomatoes. Great flavor but shit presentation.  I returned the french onion soup because it was unbelievably salty. Fyi I put salt on top of everything that my gf and grandma tell at me so when I say its salty.... it's pretty bad! 930 our food finally arrived at our table and we took 3 bits and asked for a box because we were so feed up with our lack of service and long wait. This place needs a strong manager because whoever is doing the job now is not doing a great job. He or she should be fired for running the place the way they do.  If you are the owner please respond and I will help you get your restuarant running the way it should be. You could have a gold mine but not with your management or the salt problem you have in the kitchen.",

I was so happy to find this place. The weather was perfect, and we ended up sitting outside, with a spectacular view of Pittsburgh. It was fantastic.!  After a quick look at the menu we decided on the poached pear salad for myself and the grilled Grecian wrap for my husband. I couldn't think of two better on trays for a perfect summer day. My salad had poached pears, gorgonzola, and pecans topped with a vinaigrette that was delicious. Very fresh and healthy option. My husband's wrap was full of Mediterranean style chicken, feta cheese and a tzatziki sauce. It was actually quite large, definitely big enough for an adult male.   There were a lot of servers coming in and out to help us on the patio, we never felt neglected out there like sometimes happens at other restaurants. Looking forward to bringing one of my girlfriends here for lunch in the near future.",

You then go to the restaurant floor which has beautiful view of downtown Pittsburgh, but the walls are covered with weird murals of Pittsburgh sports photos blown up to giant size. And then one wall has an ugly drink station with beat up cabinets that's always in view.  Food was okay, but was quite expensive for the quality. You're paying for the food, not food quality unfortunately.  Overall I think this place would be setup better as a bar - something where they could $12 for a rum and coke and you could lean back and enjoy the view of Pittsburgh and talk with friends.",

It is a place you come to eat something and enjoy the VIEW.   We ordered some sandwiches and although they werent terrible... but they werent anything to write home about. The grilled cheese and tomato bisque was bland the tomato bisque was grainy and lacked flavor. The other people in my party had no complaints about the sandwiches. Just standard fare.  I will say the homemade potato chip were crispy and delicious and I would recommend ordering those. The fries were also solid.   Solid 2.5 star place... I bumped it to 3 bc we had a good time. Come and enjoy the view but dont expect to be blown away.",

Their price point is a bit high but I can't help but think it's just a tax for dining with a view lol the variety of aged-steaks, seafood & sandwiches made for a difficult decision of which way to go. I ended up getting the crab cake sandwich which was very filling. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to try the pork nachos which was the main reason I even went lol (friend from Pburg told me about them)",

She told us that on their menu it states that they don't seat children under a certain age when we asked to see the menu it was not stated anywhere. I asked to speak to the manager who came out and was completely nasty and unprofessional. We would never give this place our business again. Just so happens another group that we are here visiting Pittsburgh with came to the restaurant yesterday whose daughter is 4 and they were allowed to be seated. If you're going to be consistent do it for all not just some and change your attitude when dealing with customers. Very nasty hostess and manager.",

I have been numerous times but it's strictly a place I come to get drinks. Beers are decently priced. I've had appetizers a few different times and they are always good just overpriced and nothing special. I've never been for dinner. The inside decor is a little outdated. If you sit on the deck the restroom is a bit annoying because you have to go up 2 flights of steps. I will say the service is always good. I just recently came with a party of 10 and they were very accommodating with our seating arrangement outside. It's right by the Duquesne incline so if you're on Mt Washington and want to sit back and take in the amazing view I defiantly recommend stopping in.",

She is awesome! As for the food, it is overpriced and nothing to brag about, but the drinks are actually affordable. A bottle of beer is $4.50, which I think is pretty cheap for a place like this. I've never eaten dinner here, only lunch, but I'd like to try it sometime. I also like to recommend they open the deck all the way upstairs for people who just want to sit outside to enjoy the weather & view with a few beverages.

    "text": "I hate having to do negative reviews, but there's no way to sugar-coat it: our recent visit to Grandview Saloon was just bad.  We came on a Saturday night, after calling and being told that although tables inside were all reserved for the night, there would be seating in the bar and outside 'first-come first-served.'  So, willing to wait a bit for one of these famous-view tables, we went up and were fortunately able to immediately get a seat at one of the tables in the bar area.  No view of the city from there, but there was a good view of the Buccos game on the big TV, so we were happy with that.  Our waitress brought our drinks right away, and she took our order shortly after.  We were off to a good start, but things started to look a little dismal when the mushroom soup that we ordered hadn't shown up after about twenty minutes.  We had decided to split a bowl of the soup, an appetizer, and an entree, and then each ordered our own side salads.  (There was nothing on the menu to indicate you couldn't share an entree, nor was there an additional plate fee for doing so.)  Finally, after 45 minutes, our appetizer arrived.  We got the jalapeno crab dip, which was really good, and came with lightly fried pita triangles.  The dip was served still hot, so we figured that the kitchen was just backed up.  At this point, we noticed that our waitress was not only waiting on her tables, she was making the drink orders for all of her own tables, in addition to the drinks for those of some of the other waitstaff.  My best guess is that she was normally a bartender who got assigned to wait tables when another server called off, but never once did she say anything to indicate that they were short-staffed, or even say, \"Sorry for the delay, your food is coming out soon.\"    Finally, after twenty more minutes, our food arrived.  As in, ALL OF IT arrived at once.  The soup, our side salads, and our 'entree' were brought to the table at once.  The soup was already at room temperature, and for a thick soup like a cream of mushroom, it has to be hot to not overwhelm you with the weight of it.  We each had a few bites and that was it.  We had ordered the grilled scallops entree, and at $26, I had expected more than 5 scallops and half a plate of French fries.  (The menu said 'roasted potato wedges,' but what actually arrived were the equivalent of the seasoned fries from the old Rally's restaurant - don't get me wrong, they were mighty tasty, but for 'roasted potato wedges' they were not what I expected).  We were just upset at this.  We really wanted to enjoy our dinner and take in the sights from Mt. Washington, but poor service and food quality just prevented that.  I am typically very forgiving of slow service during busy times, but I do kind of expect some, 'Hey, sorry, we're really backed up because of ___ tonight, it's going to be a little longer for your food,' from my servers.  Especially for the prices of the Grandview Saloon - the food here was not significantly cheaper than the meals at LeMont, but the quality, amount, and presentation of the food did not even come close to stacking up.  However, all of this said, I do believe very strongly in second chances, and if I were to receive a coupon or have a Groupon deal for the Grandivew Saloon, I think we would return just to see if we were there first on an off-night.  When it comes to paying full-price for a meal though, for now, I will be sticking to the Mt. Washington restaurants I know.",

The kitchen is at the front of the restaurant when you first walk in with the host stand on the edge of the kitchen (interesting).  One of my only gripes is the decor in this place. I am not an interior designer or anything and not everything has to be super chic but this place is just bland.  White walls, two pieces of art, cheesy chairs. This place has so much potential just needs some CHARACTER!   I was starving so I order their mushroom bisque (even though I never eat creamy soup) and it was heavy but delicious! I ordered the crab cakes and YUM! Big chunks of crab meat!!! Delicious and HUGE.   I also had two bloody marys during the meal as well which were very spicy and tasty.   My dad got their Banana Creme Pie Ice Cream which was AMAZING! Their list of interesting ice cream flavors was impressive (even my dad was impressed and he is an absolute ice cream connoisseur)   PRO: Fast service, great food, a lot of daily specials, excellent desserts, outdoor seating  CON: $10 Parking, boring decor   OVERALL: WILL BE BACK FOR SURE",

To go with your view, you can choose from a good selection of drinks and more mediocre Pittsburghesque (i.e., comfort) food. The design of the patio is fine, but the interior of the restaurant is very plain. This is a shame, because with a little work on the interior design and menu, the view could make this one of the city's most interesting restaurants.

    "text": "I joined Yelp specifically to say this: The Grandview Saloon was one of the worst culinary experiences of my life.  I would rather lick the grease off the tracks of the Duquesne Incline next door than suffer through another meal here again.  The entire Grandview concept appears to be premised on the belief that as long as you've got a phenomenal view, you can charge inflated prices for food you'd be offended to find in a middle school cafeteria. In general, the food I saw was all-American in the worst possible sense - bland, slimy, and whenever possible, smothered with cheese.  In our case, the chicken marsala recipe eschewed the traditional topping for some kind of watery combination of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The shrimp scampi tasted as if it was prepared by a chef without a tongue. Our request for pita chips that were simply warm, not fried, elicited a significant delay from the kitchen, as if they couldn't figure out why any of their customers wouldn't want to slurp up something lathered in butter and oil.  Frankly, we should have run out the door the moment we sat down.  My brother-in-law aptly described the decor as a Days Inn ballroom circa 1995.  The walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them.  Of course, you've got an incredible view of the downtown skyline, but that's no excuse for such hideous decorative malfeasance.  After all, Vincent van Gogh didn't frame Starry Night in particle board he pulled from a dumpster.  If you've got even one iota of romantic feeling left after surveying what must surely be an accurate replica of Purgatory, the Top 40 hits from five year ago blaring over the soundtrack will surely kill the mood once and for all.  While you enjoy the strains of Pink's \"Get the Party Started,\" you'll be left munching on beer-battered blobs, silently wondering why your life feels so empty and numb.  To think that I paid almost $70 here for a two-person dinner that didn't even include alcohol makes me want to gnaw off my own pinkie with rage.  That experience would be tastier, cheaper, and far more pleasant than my time at Grandview.  However, my sacrifice will only achieve some higher meaning if I can serve as a warning to the rest of humanity.  For a great night out, check out the free view from the public observation point a few doors down, and then eat in literally any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

The half of the tiny piece of the steak was fat and overcooked. we got a fish and a New York Strip but this strip was just horrible. The fish was mediocre. nothing special. They tend to have overcook your steak generally so when we asked for a medium rare, it wasn't a surprise to see a well done steak. But the portion didn't even seem like it was 12 oz (much smaller) and the fat was just grossly too much. So we told our waiter that we were very disappointing and we dont want this dish anymore but he just kept making excuses that it is because of the way its cut and that much of fat is normal so he can't refund nor make a new steak since we already had some. He ended up taking 10 dollars off for 2 beers but that was it. Not even for my drinks, just my boyfriend's since it was his food. No apologies, no attempt to make up for it, nothing. Their filet mignon and tuna steak are what we usually get but it was just a terrible mistake to try something new; ended up seeing their worst customer service. Never will I go back here or take anyone especially when there are so many restaurants with higher quality food and much better service for the same price with similar views (or less). 15% of tip I left was too much for their service.",

    "text": "Great views, not so good food or service. Table of 9, on a somewhat slow Saturday night. No wait. Apps were good (jumbo shrimp and calamari). So it started out great. Unfortunately, it went south from there. I ordered one of their signature fish dishes \"Cod Plaki\" - a Parmesan encrusted cod with fresh tomatoes, spinach, red onion, greek olives and garlic, topped with feta cheese. I ordered it with the seasonal vegetable, asparagus, and a Cesar salad. The salad arrived with the romain lettuce cut too small and wilted from being over chilled, the croutons were even soggy and worst of all it had a long hair in it that ended up in my mouth! Yuck. So I pushed that aside and didn't make a scene as I was with a large group of business folks and the waitress was like 8 months pregnant. My entree arrived and I was presented with a thin cod filet topped as described BUT with the asparagus laid on top. The asparagus had nearly the same texture and flavor as canned asparagus and was totally unacceptable, so I pushed that aside. Diving into the fish I found it overcooked and rubbery. And I could not find or identify the Parmesan flavor or crust on the fish.   Overall a totally unsatisfying meal. And they automatically added a 20% tip even though I got my bill individually. There are too many other fine choices in Pgh to ever recommend this one.",

The Grandview Saloon offers several floors of dining and drinking.  The food, if I remember was probably two-three stars, but to be honest, I haven't been there since it got cold.  I think there was a new manager starting who was interested in introducing better wine and food so things may have changed since I was last there in the fall, but either way the service was always friendly and again, the views great.    It's also been surprisingly easy to get a table outside the times I have gone there--I would have thought this place would be packed all the time.   Another nice bonus is that it is located next to the Duquesne Incline.  I enjoyed giving out-of-town guests a chance to catch the incline and then have a drink there at the top before heading back down.  I look forward to warmer weather soon and getting chance to head back up there!",

    "text": "My experience started when I called for reservations for my wife's birthday. I called and I asked for reservations in the afternoon a few days before going. They took my name and number and said they'd have to check and call me back in an hour. I thought that was strange. After three hours, no call back. My wife meanwhile called and made reservations because that's what she wanted to do on her birthday. I called again and they said no problem. I asked about a window seat. Had to put $25 down to guarantee a window seat at our scheduled time of 6:30 PM. The fee gets refunded off your bill. It is to guarantee you come so I could understand I guess, views are limited.  We arrived and were promptly seated. The waiter was attentive and polite. I thought \"hmmm, good, maybe the bad reviews were full of it after all\" after reading reviews and checking here on Yelp and Google. We each received a soda beverage since we don't drink (I was driving, she doesn't drink). The soda was good, not watered down or funny tasting like some carbonated taps are. We both ordered Delmonico Steaks and salads as side orders. The salads came and were fine. Then our meals come pretty quickly. Great service! I thought. Then the bottom of the bucket fell out.  Her steak was done right, ordered medium well. Mine was ordered medium rare and was well. I can't eat a steak at a \"steakhouse\" that costs almost $40 as well done. I complained and they promptly re-fired me another. That one came out in a few minutes and was blue all through - rare. Sent back for a few minutes. Came back and although better was still more rare then medium rare but whatever, I'd rather it be more rare then cooked. The steak by now was pretty much ruined with vital juice gone and being a little tough. This was a $39 steak. unacceptable. I also ordered \"red skinned roasted potatoes\". I ended up with what I call \"Idaho fried burnt potatoes\" which were chopped up idaho potato that was fried or roasted to a crisp.  My main focus is on the steaks we ordered. Besides the atmosphere and decor not being very pleasant nor romantic - cafeteria style tables and chairs, crowded, not very pleasant - the steaks were plain bad. How dare they call themselves a \"steakhouse\". It is known and signed as Grandview Saloon and Coal Steakhouse. They couldn't cook a steak to save their life. The steak was half fat (I know Delmonicos have marbling but not this bad) and not charred. A \"real\" steakhouse normally puts a nice char on the outside. They did slap some kind of glaze sauce and garlic butter on it, which wasn't bad. Half the steak came home for the dog.   So in summary, we treated this place as a steakhouse in which it is billed as. This could be farther from the truth. My steak wasn't cooked right twice. The decor is something out of a cafeteria. The view was stunning. Maybe if we kept \"cheap\" and ordered a sandwich instead it would have been better. This was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner with a romantic view of the city and turned out to be a dud. It was a $125 view. I left there still hungry. Although I would try a sandwich or something else instead I would not go back. Too many other good choices. As for the steak dinner, I'd go to Texas Roadhouse or Lone Star for a much better experience. The steaks are actually tastier there. One last thing, our waiter didn't even to offer a comp for the lousy steak. My bad for not pushing it. I just wanted to get the hell out of there and not ruin my wife's birthday any further.  Two stars for the view , salads were edible and soda was good. The waiter was attentive and polite. Other than that, save your money. As another reviewer stated called it: \"A tourist trap\". Shame on us.",

However, the great find at the Grandview Saloon was the light, crunchy and tasty french fries. I'm usually a bigger fan of steak fries, but these thinner cut crunchers were outstanding.  Service was friendly, helpful and prompt. Obviously, the view is the reason for the restaurant, but they don't cheat you on the food (which wasn't overly expensive).",

We considered having dinner in the Mount Washington area, but none of the restaurants looked all that attractive to us (no offense, but they kind of seemed like tourist traps). With that, we could see Grandview Saloon's outdoor terrace from the observation area adjacent to the Duquesne Incline Station, so we figured we'd amble over there for a drink.   We were seated promptly and given a great table right at the edge of the balcony. Wow, the view is fantastic, especially at sunset time! The drink/cocktail menu offers your typical assortment of martinis, beer, wine, etc. I had a Ketel martini ($14) and my friend had a beer - The martini was nice and cold, and big, so a good value for what it was. It was a great place to unwind and take in the sights of Pittsburgh. It seems pretty popular overall, and their food did look good. A solid choice on Mount Washington for a casual meal or relaxing cocktail.",

    "text": "We rode the Duquesne Incline and decided to get some lunch at the top on a Tuesday.  Personally, I wanted to try something local instead of the usual chain suspects down at the bottom in the \"Fake Town.\"  This was our only choice really and I was not sure what to expect because the outside on the street level is pretty plain and non-descript.  Got an amazing seat on their awesome deck and felt right at home.  Friendly staff, great beer selection, awesome interior and exterior dining options, and a nice local vibe.  The food (Caesar and Chicken Salad, Calamari) was fresh and well prepared.  A good crowd too for a Tuesday at 1pm.  Decent prices and good value.  Thumbs up all around.",

It is really convenient to the incline. If you want to see Pittsburgh, go there and take the incline at least one direction.",
