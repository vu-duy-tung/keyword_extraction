    "text": "Let me first say that the service is great!  So cudo's to the waitress, however, the waitress only takes the order and brings the food.  The bread served was stale and tasteless, the oil dipping sauce matched.  We started with fresh deep fried mozzarella, despite being cooked, the cheese was cold and soggy.  I have had this dish elsewhere and it has been prepared properly.  Here I would not recommend at all!  We have been here a couple of times and the food is very inconsistent, perhaps average at best depending on the dish you order.  The Veal Marsala was one of the worst I have ever ordered anywhere.  The veal was clearly a lesser cut, basically a roll roast cut into thick slices, NOT pounded flat at all.  So it was just several pieces of 3/8\" hockey puck size of veal which was not tender.  The Marsala sauce was missing something, tasted bitter or sour, I think it was missing the marsala.  The dish was overpowered by an excessive quantity of jumbo shitake mushrooms, I mean overpowered.  Not an enjoyable meal at all.  My wife ordered the Bucatini with marinara, now that was not bad, the bucatini is a relatively large round noodle which is like spaghetti on steriods.  Overall the restaurant is very small and very noisy, but that is acceptable.  But the food is just a complete hit or miss for the price.  Too pricey for hit or miss!!",

Our latest adventure to IB brought a table of 8. I'm sure they were annoyed with us seeing I called the day of to make reservations and called back 2 more times that day to change the number of people. Regardless, our table was ready when we arrived.  We started our meal with the calamari, fried zucchini, and sausage with peppers and onions. The sausage is my favorite app. Not too sweet, not too spicy. Perfectly complimented with freshly sauteed onions and peppers. Although I have tried many dishes at IB, my go to is the grilled chicken (pollo griglia) with vegetables. Two marinated chicken breasts grilled and served with a huge plateful of various veggies-carrots, broccoli, potatoes, onions, peppers, cauliflower, brussel sprouts. If it's in season, you're getting it. I always add a large helping of the shredded cheese they leave for you on the table. Another favorite is the pasta bolognaise which hubs ordered and I stole a few bites of. They also offer a few desserts that change with the season. Unfortunately, I'm usually too full to try them. Overall, small restaurant, not much in the way of decor/ambience but great food.",

    "text": "Was in this mall for business, so it was convenient just to walk over to get dinner here after I read the great reviews on this place. First, its a small family owned (I think) restaurant. There was a lot to chose from the menu and this place was packed for a Tuesday night, which is an indicator that it probably has a good following.  Dinner starts off with fresh bread with garlic spread. For appetizers we had the fried zuccini and meatballs. What a great way to start a meal! Then for entrees we had the chicken piccata, veal masala and chicken gagnoli (not sure it was grilled chicken with veggies). All were great. We topped off the meal with desert of home made ice cream. Creamy and delicious with almond flavor and bits of cherries.  Service was prompt and many others brought their own wines. The waitress messed up my order, so I had to wait for it to be redone. She thought that I ordered a pasta dish when I had ordered chicken.  I would definitely visit this restaurant again and recommend it to others. This is the best Italian food that I have had in a long time.",

Some might think a little pricey...our dinner was $70 for 2, with one app, 2 dinners and one desert.  But for good quality I thought it worth it.  I had the Balsamico and my dinner partner had the Griglia.  Both meals were very good.  The Balsamico is done with a balsamic reduction.  Just wonderful.  Service was really good.  If your lucky to get Krysten, she was friendly, funny and very attentive.  It's a byob place so bring a good bottle and enjoy.  Reservations recommended.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this restaurant and I heard good things about it. I Made reservations for 2 on a Wednesday afternoon and we were the only two in the restaurant. We were seated at a two top and received the signature bread and bean dip, which was mediocre.   The server corked our bottle of wine and came back honestly 2 minutes later asking if we were ready to order. I replied \"no.\" She went back to the server station to read her \"OK\" magazine.   Another couple entered the restaurant and was seated at the two top table directly next to us out of the entire empty restaurant. C'mon! The server came back a few minutes later and took our order. I ordered the Caprese salad and The Griglia Chicken which coincidentally, so did my fiance. The salad came out in a quick manor and was delicious. I was optimistic that our dinner would be as well.  When the entree arrived, I was very dissapointed. It was simply plain grilled chicken and grilled vegetables which I could easily cook on my grill at my house. The menu described it as, \"Grilled Chicken with Lemon Basil Marinade?\" It was extremely bland and flavorless.   We were never checked on throughout the meal- and our waitress socialized with the only other waitress on duty. We will definitely not be returning. What a dissapointing experience!",

    "text": "I picked this restaurant for my birthday dinner with my cousins. I'm attracted to 'made-to-order' restaurants that can accommodate someone with a severe dairy allergy, but unfortunately I chose poorly. Let me caveat by saying that the rest of my family had an amazing meal here. The atmosphere is cute, the server was very sweet and accommodating, but sadly the chef was sloppy and careless. After explaining my dairy allergy, the waitress brought me my dinner. After two bites, I felt a tingle on my lip and proceeded to fork a piece of penne, which had a long string of cheese attached to it. The waitress was extremely embarrassed and apologetic & took my entree to the kitchen, where the chef denied that there was any cheese in the dish, but begrudgingly made another one for me. The second round tasted awful and was missing the shrimp I had ordered, but at this point the rest if my party was almost finished eating, so I just let it go. The waitress was nice enough to take he shrimp off my bill, but not the entire dinner. I mean they only almost sent me to the hospital. In any case, this is a nice restaurant but steer clear if you have any dietary restrictions. Made to order? Not so much.",

The waitresses were very clueless on thier job and came back 2 times to ask what we had ordered because she didn't write it down. The atmosphere is very dense and tight if your looking for a date night with your significant other, then this isn't the place. People will over hear your conversations. The main thing that bothered me the most. She was very rude towards her employees and would do personal things like brush her hair, where the previous prepared food is. The main thing that got to me while I was dining at this place was that, she had invited like maybe 5 friends to have dinner with her and we waited a half hour for our food so that she could get serves first along with all her friend. Keep in mind that I got there before her and her friends.  This place is over rated. And I advise not to waste your money on it and because it is very pricey there.",

The menu looked great and were excited to try both the fried zucchini and the fried mozzerella.  However, we were told that their fryer broke.  Half of our party were vegetarians and there were no other appetizers on the menu that we could eat.   We ended up with the salads which were good.  We were told the specials and and ordered.  After 45 min, we were told that they ran out of the ravioli.  We fully understand that sometimes things like this happen, however, the owner (who was at another table dining with others) was EXTREMELY rude.  She basically yelled at us in front of the entire restaurant and told us there is nothing she can do and order something else.  Very disappointed with service and hope I can save others from experiencing this type of rudeness that you are paying for.  Many other italian restaurants in area with much better food and service.",

I have ordered these from time to time and have always enjoyed them. It is not an overly large place so it can be hard to get a table. Given this I have ordered take out from here multiple times and it has always held up well. They also make it a point to give you everything that would be served to a sit down patron such as bread.",

The caprese salad is fresh and the mozzarella is very good.  I had the crab and angel hair with pinon nuts for my entree and my fiance practically stole it. He ordered the chicken parmesan equally as good, but just different, (obviously)  The pasta is al dente, perfectly cooked crab, olive oil/butter sauce, good parm, and toasted pine nuts. YUM!  The chicken is very lightly breaded, crisp, tender, juicy, and flavorful. Just the right amount of red sauce and cheese.   Tiramisu! We ate so much bread and pasta and chicken, I don't know how I managed to practically lick the plate. (if we weren't in such close quarters to other patrons, I just may have) It is so good. Creamy and rich. I wish they gave you a bigger slice. :)  This tiny BYOB is cramped, always busy, and has that mom and pop, humbled, great service that feels like family is serving you. I will frequent this establishment every time we come to visit!  Try and make a reservation, especially on weekends!  You will have to work out for a week to work this meal off, but it is sooooo worth it!",

They can't find another location that would shield customers from the open door at the same time giving kitchen the room they need to work? It seems that they feel like the customer should feel privileged to eat there, regardless of the conditions.  I found that incredibly odd.",

She kept giving us free bread and when we wanted to share the caprese app she put it on three separate plates for us to make it easier. I had the paparadelle with sausage onion goat cheese and a lite tomato sauce. She let me sub out sausage for eggplant. The portion was enormous, and extremely flavorful. It was a hidden gem for sure!",

Il burloni hits the nail on the head with its salads.    Chcoloate snowball cake did not have a lot of flavor, either in the white icing or the chocolate cake.  French press coffee was very good.",

Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, which was amazing, considering she was the only waitress in the entire restaurant for the majority of our meal.   For appetizers, we had the grilled calamari and fried zucchini... both equally delicious, but pleasing in different ways. The calamari was perfectly tender and flavorful in an olive marinara.  The zucchini was paper thin and fried to perfection. I had the caprese salad and then the veal piccata, a little tart, but delicious.  Others at the table - caesar salads, veal marsala, veal milenese and the absolute best at the table... parpadalle with sausage and goat cheese.  Seriously, the pasta knocked everything out of the park!   We finished the meal with house made tiramisu and a 1/2 press of coffee. This meal was absolute perfection.  The atmosphere left a little to be desired, as it is in a strip mall and the tables/chairs/booths looked a little thrown together.  But was quickly forgotten when the food was presented.  Also - BYOB with 5$ corkage fee... doesn't get better than that! One suggestion - make reservations in advance.  We've tried to get in several times by calling that night/weekend and finally got a table when we called 2 weeks in advance. We can't wait to go back!  Well done, all!",

So finally got the chance to reserve for 5 PM on a Sunday - not busy but people were just starting  l swarm in . A small place indoors and a lot of tables outside which are a little cramped. The decor is nothing to boast about yet pleasant . Now the food - the bread - you can even avoid it . Not worth it .  The Penne in vodka sauce - flavorful , beautiful colors and top notch !  The special of the day - pork chops with a lot of veggies ( including sweet pepper) and sausage - highlight of the day ! Very rich Tomato sauce - excellent sausage - the pork chops weren't cook f to perfection but nothing that cannot be overlooked   So all in all this place is worth the praise !",

I had been wanting to check out this restaurant for quite some time, but never got around to it due to the fact the the inside is really small, so you need to make reservations ahead of time.  Recently, on a Tuesday, my friend and I were getting our nails done a few doors down and smelt the food when leaving the nail salon. It smelt great, so we decided to walk over and see what it was all about. People were sitting outside. They had little tables set up alone the sidewalk. We decided to give it a try and boy am I glad we did!  The service was absolutely amazing. I wish I could remember our servers name to give her a shout out. I got the penne vodka, add Italian sausage. Absolutely delicious and such a large portion, I was able to eat the other half for Lunch the next day. My friend got an eggplant dish that was on special and it too, was incredible. I will certainly be returning and I recommend you readers to do the same. Just remember, make a reservation if you are trying to go on the weekend!",

I would advise to check their website or call to verify hours because they are not open for lunch and it varies each day of when they open for dinner. I went here for my birthday with a girlfriend. We both had the penne vodka with shrimp. They serve a nice sized portion, so you're not leaving hungry, which is a huge plus! The salad I had was good and the bread and oil was also tasty. There aren't many tables inside and outside, which is nice for a more intimate setting. The only con of the evening was our waitress was a bit distracted and didn't check on us much. It was odd since it was a Wednesday evening and our waitress only had one other table (a two top), so I'm not sure what her issue was. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable and delicious dinner.",

Tiramisu is more \"cakey\" (which I prefer.  Don't enjoy eating just cream)  I've come here just to buy sauce to bring home for when we make pasta.  The place is very small, so reservations are recommended.",
