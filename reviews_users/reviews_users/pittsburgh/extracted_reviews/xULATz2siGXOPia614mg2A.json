I think to make up for the prices staying the same, they decided to comprise quality.  I recently I went there and ordered the Szechuan Chicken Noodle Bowl. The dish is supposed to be spicy, when it arrived and the sauce was red. It looked spicy, but as soon as I tasted it, I realized it was extremely sweet. The sauce was so sweet, that I was unable to eat it. Once the sauce started to cool down, the sauce started to thicken like candy.",

I am yet to review  it because I guess I didnt think it needed one since it has been around so long.  I consider this place to be a staple in the Oakland dining landscape.  With a wide selection of dishes, appetizers, and specials, there is something on the menu for everyone.  Besides having the best Bubble Tea in the city, here is a list of my favorite or \"go to\"  menu items:  *Spicy szechuan chicken bowl *General Tso's chicken- Seriously it's the best *Korean pork fried rice *Dr. Fu's Favorite Noodles *Crab Rangoon- addictive!  Good quality food, made with care, at affordable prices.  Don't let some of the underwhelming reviews deter you from trying it for yourself.  The food is really yummy!",

Food is okay but it is their service that always pulled me, however today we got extremely disappointed (me, my wife and my friend we 3 went there). First my wife she ordered Korean bibimap with chicken but she got duck. That's no big deal so we didn't complain the disappointment was when a waitress got the bill while we were still eating and she waited right in front of me it was awkward so I pulled my credit card and gave her. She then left and came back in 2 min and while my friend was still eating (he was literally putting his spoon on his mouth ) the waitress said  \"when are you going to pay\". That was really rude. I told her he will pay once he is done. It's not that we were there for long we took hardly 15 or 20 min to eat there and it was not even a closing hours.  I eat out regularly and i always pay about 20 percent tips but this time I didn't tip. The funny part was that the cashier came to collect the cash from my friend and the cashier said u should tip to the server.... lol... I politely told him what made me tip her zero he gracefully accepted and gave me the number to complain.  To all the people who work in Lulu place. U guys are awsum. I love how friendly u guys are. Your service is great it is just one individual server. I will not stop going to lulu place but If I ever get the same server I will request for another server.",

My initial reaction was to scream when a roach crawled by my dinner table, but I didnt want to be rude.  But no manager being on duty, and them not seeming to care that it happened was a real turn off.  I told them their customer service needs A LOT of improvement.  The only good thing to eat in this place is their Yellow Curry, and with the roach scare, I will not be returning as they're other dishes are pretty lackluster.  I'm not a college student anymore so I can choose a better place to eat.  It's a shame.  I used to eat here 1x/week, but hadnt been there in a while, and now, I will never return",

Waits in excess of 45 minutes for noodles are not on heard of. They constantly look unsure of who is to be served next and which of the staff should be responsible for what.   The food is high end dorm food. It's not unpalatable but the Chinese/Japanese/South Asian winds up just muddling all the flavors rather than creating anything authentic.   You're much better off paying a little bit more at the higher end restaurants on Craig for significantly higher quality food.  Alternatively you could pay significantly less at one of the many chains-restaurants and get food of equal quality.   Avoid this place.",

We were sat on a Monday night and waited at least about 15 minutes for someone to come wait on us.  Once he did, he rushed me through the questions I had on a dish instead asking what meat I wanted with the noodles instead of answering the question.  I just ordered it with chicken hoping for the best.  The food came out quickly once we ordered it, but we had to beg the guy delivering it (not our waiter), for something to drink since the waiter never asked what we wanted.  The noodle dishes (Dr. Fu's and Singapore Noodles) were just ok.  I was with a native Chinese citizen, so he didn't like them much at all.  He will definitely not go back, I might if I really was desperate.  The best thing about the place is that it is not expensive.  Just don't go in looking for good service and spectacular food.",

One of my friends told that the pad thai here is her absolute favorite. Well, since pad thai is one of my favorite foods of all time, I obviously had to try it. Firstly, it was really nothing like real pad thai. The sauce was dark brown (unlike pad thai sauce should be) and it was ridiculously sweet. If anything, it tasted more like pad see-ew. Also, I felt like I was nearly eating soup because my food was swimming in the sauce. My girlfriend got bibimbap, which is another dish we absolutely love. Traditionally it's served in a ceramic pot that keeps it cooking when you get it, and the pot is filled with delicious rice and vegetables and topped with kimchi and sides of delicious sauces and more kimchi. We got a bowl that was literally just steamed white rice and vegetables and maybe two little pieces of mediocre kimchi. Absolutely no seasoning or flavor. The sauce the served it with was ok, but it didn't make up for the lack of taste the rest of the food had.  Oh, I did get a mango milk tea for dessert, and it was pretty good. It had hardly any tapioca pearls in it...  I'm really not usually negative, but this place just didn't do it for me. I was really disappointed with my food.",

Highlights include the Lard Nar Pork, Hong Kong Chow Fun Beef, almost any noodle bowl, the Teriyaki Chicken Salad. And the gyoza appetizer, so yummy! As a group, me and my coworkers like to hit it once a month. For those who might peruse the menu, Yum Wok is the more mainstream Chinese menu, LuLu's Noodles being a collection of different Asian noodle dishes.  update - When I wrote this there was only maybe one other review. I hear you guys. Yeah, don't get the stuff that's not Chinese. You are NOT going to get good or authentic pad thai, or teriyaki chicken, or udon.  You will usually get tasty, not overly greasy, Americanized Chinese food. Although the gyoza is very, very good.",

When there is miscommunication or they couldn't understand what I said, they yelled at me.

However, today I was starving and want to have Pat Thai so bad. I couldn't find anywhere else (Little Asia didn't accept credit card under $10). Therefore, I went there and I realized that there is nothing changed. To me, it is amazing that they're still running their business. In addition, food is not that impressive to endure their awful service. Until other people have different kind of Pat Thai, I didn't know that there is another option I can choose.

We loved that the wonton soup had shrimp dumplings instead of the normal pork(a very nice twist to a classic!) and the Rangoon's were perfect(I'm usually a big critic of those, hard to find good ones). And we both thought it was the BEST pad Thai we had ever had!!!! Oh and the bubble tea is still just as good! I got honeydew with green tea and milk and I could have easily had a second.

Lulu's will always hold a special place in my heart, because coming here with one of my friends in undergrad was one of the first times that I ever chose a more \"Thai\" style restaurant over a traditional Americanized Chinese restaurant (I've matured a lot more now). Back then, I adored this place because I really didn't have anything else to compare it to. Now that I have explored many Thai restaurants, I will say that I still like Lulu's, but I'm not as obsessed as I was back in undergrad. There's nothing wrong with the food here- it's always delicious, the staff is extremely friendly and the menu is totally affordable. It's just not the best thai food I've ever had. If I find myself hungry in this end of Oakland and I have enough time to sit down and have a meal, I will go to Lulu's and I will enjoy my experience there. But I won't drive across the city for it, if I'm not already near it. You catch my drift?",

Never have I been so disappointed by an Asian restaurant-- seriously, even Oriental Express is more authentic than the shit they serve here. Every single time I ordered a noodle dish, I've been shown a new way in which that food could be horribly disgraced. Overpriced, overrated, and I absolutely abhor the decor.   The decor is obscenely cheesy-- why do I want to look at stock photo images of people touching my noodles in ways that violate all kinds of health codes? It just makes me wonder what passes as \"sanitary\" in their kitchen.   Pad Thai: a sad pile of overcooked rice noodles with a wretched, bland peanut sauce that lethargically oozes like Jabba the Hut. Pathetic doesn't even begin to describe it. I could smear peanut butter on dried ramen noodles for a better experience.  Pho: well how could you really expect this place to create a beef consomme-esque broth with authentic viet flavors? Awful. I can't even.  My review may be slightly inaccurate because I haven't been there since people lied to my stupid freshman dorm about how great this place is, but if it hasn't changed since then RUN AWAY.

It also takes me a lot of effort for a waiter/waitress to pour me water every time. The cashier yelled at me once for using a credit card. It might just be my personal opinion, but I feel like the staffs are nicer to white customers than Asian customers.   Also, Rose Tea Cafe has the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh, not Lulu's.",

The twice cooked pork was as written as \"the most popular northern Chinese dishes\". Oh c'mon, are u kidding me? At the first I saw the dish, I thought they made mistake about what I want. The pork was in south style!!! And it is just not the real twice cooked pork! And the noodles, like lulu's noodles, and like Dr. Fu's noodles, gosh, disgusting, that's all I want to say about the noodles. Trust me, nearly every Chinese knows how to cook noodles, but this restaurant do not know. I don't know why some people like it, but when I saw nearly all the people there were American, I know why, because Chinese people will tell u that even this restaurant may make some dishes that adjust to American's flavor, it is still not Chinese food. I don't expect that it will make real Chinese food, but seriously, this restaurant is like running as a Chinese restaurant, but actually it is neither Chinese nor American. If this restaurant runs in China, c'mon, people will kill it.  The only thing I thought may be good, is the bubble tea. Because it is the most most most easiest thing in China.",

The restaurant itself has a very casual and atmosphere, during lunch you order at the counter, as most of its patrons are Pitt/Carnegie Mellon students.  The restaurant is clean and spacious, and the service is wonderful.   As it is a pan-Asian restaurant, don't expect  its food to very authentic to any particular region... I was very surprised as what was passed off as \"pho\" the first time I ate there.  It was certainly not anything like what you would get at an actual Vietnamese restaurant- the broth was bland and I think they used the wrong kind of noodles, and it didn't come with lime/lemon.  I should have known better.   I did however LOVE their pad thai- which was also not very authentic- no tamarind paste etc.  It was good though because I was craving a carb fest.  So all in all, I'd give it three stars, they have their own interpretations of classic Asian dishes, and whether their interpretations of them are good or not is a crap shoot.",

I've had way better Asian food, and worked in Irvine, CA for ten years, so my standards are high, admittedly. My Ma Po Tofu tasted like it came out of a can. My friend's veggie Pho had bland soup base, and canned mushrooms, that's a killer for me right there.  If you want really good Pho, go to Tram's or Pho Mihn on Penn in Lawrenceville. For suburb sushi, try Chaya in Sq. Hill. And for good Korean, go to Sushi Kim's in the Strip.  In fact, I think any Asian place in Pittsburgh, would be better than going here.   Or just save a few bucks, and get a package of Ramen at the grocery store and add an egg to it. Even that's better than the so called noodles at Lu Lu's!",

A good boba has to have right texture-- soft yet chewy at the same time. I came here with my husband and son, and we each ordered something different. I don't even remember the names of the dishes because they were just not worth remembering. They were that bad! All I remember was mine was some kind of a noodle dish. The noodles were soggy and the sauce tasted like it came straight out of a can or bottle and was just dumped into the bowl of noodles. I was so hungry, but couldn't even force myself to finish half of my dish because it was that bad. I do not recommend this place at all. It's fast food, fake Asian food--that's what it is!

    "text": "I had lunch at Lulu's today after St. Paul's Easter mass, only as a last resort because Crepes Parisiennes and Eat Unique were both closed for the day.  I had two bad experiences at Lulu's before, but that was about a year ago, and I was hungry.  The memories of past horrible food had faded gently in my mind, and I was feeling forgiving.    Big mistake.  I ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl, and Bob the Boyfriend ordered ramen.  The food came out fast enough, so no complaints there.  But from the first bite, it was clear that things had gone horribly awry.  The pork on top of the bowl looked and tasted like something a dog would gnaw on, tough, dry, and very salty.  Underneath, my noodles were completely unseasoned, just rice vermicelli with nothing else to speak of.    As for the boyfriend, Bob's ramen was technically ramen, I guess, since the noodles were ramen noodles.  But instead of a savory beef or pork broth, his noodles were backstroking in miso.  While this is weird and cheap-ass of them, I can't complain, since the broth was clearly described as 'miso' on the menu.  But the real problem was the miso broth itself.  The amount of miso in it made my tongue curl.  It was so salty it was almost inedible.  When the waitress asked me if everything was OK, I told her plainly about the dry pork and the bland noodles, and she said \"Yup, that's the way it comes.\"  I was stunned and didn't know what to say, so I asked her to suggest something else.  She recommended the Singapore rice noodles.    The Singapore noodles came out after a short wait, and the noodle bowl mercifully disappeared.  But then the new noodles were so heavily spiced that they were (again) almost inedible.  Certainly not bland this time, though!  I have to wonder if they were messing with me.  Finally, we asked for to go boxes and high tailed it out of there.  It was a depressing, bad experience.  Other notes: The atmosphere is horrid (loud music, completely crowded), and the waitstaff is aloof, almost bitchy.  I'm aware that this review has turned into a bit of a rant.  The fact is, as I mentioned earlier, I've had two bad experiences there before.  I'll spare you the details.  I am hoping this review will serve as a reminder to myself in the future: Erin, it doesn't matter how hungry you are or how much people try to talk you into Lulu's.  Don't cave.  Hold out for Rose Tea or anything, really--anything else.  DON'T DO IT.",

The rice noodles were undercooked (I didn't even think it was possible to undercook rice noodles, so I consider Lulu's a first).  The pork in my soup was overcooked and chewy.  The soup broth itself was incredibly bland before adding the readily available condiments such as soy sauce and chili sauce.  From what I could tell, Lulu's uses the same broth for all of their soups.  I wouldn't order their soup again.  The smoothie/bubble-tea was below average, contained real fruit but also contained the usual bubble-tea power mix; it was nothing special (I've had much better bubble-tea even without adding real fruit to the mix).  I'd drink it again in a pinch but would rather search elsewhere.  The service was terrible and for that alone I wouldn't return.  They weren't busy, there were employees standing around chatting and yet we waited almost fifteen minutes from the time our plates were collected before we had the bill.  I'm not sure how they compare to other Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh, but compared to Vancouver/Seattle/San Francisco... I'd say that the quality of food at Lulu's was about on par with the (relatively better) ramen noodles available at Asian grocery stores (the pre-packaged kind that is packaged moist, not the dehydrated crap available at Giant Eagle for twenty cents).  Compared to the average Asian restaurant that I'm used to, Lulu's was a major disappointment.",

If you can make it past the always present homeless man sitting at the front door the Dr.Fu's special is good, hot and sour soup is awesome, general tso chicken is good as well. Downsides outweigh the up for this place.",

    "text": "Visiting Pittsburgh, we were looking for a cheap and quick fix for our hunger. We came across this noodle shop near the library. It was rather cold at the time and soup sounded delish! It took them a while to make our food even though it was not that busy. Their selections in food varied, which may or may not be a good thing. The service was decent and the atmosphere was bright and open. Their green tea was not what I had anticipated however, but it was nice way to get some warmth in my hungry tummy at the time.   As far as the food quality goes, i would definitely say I've had far better ramen, but for the price I suppose it would suffice. This definitely would not be the first restaurant that I would suggest to people, but for their uber cheap price, you cant go wrong.",

I went for lunch with a bunch of friends and the looks on their faces when the food came out was comical. We were each trying to process what was on our plates. They still dove in, as did I, but my fork was brought to a halt after first bite.  I ordered a cup of the tom kha gai and the cold peanut noodles. The soup was tasteless. Usually spicy coconut soup is a) spicy, and 2) tastes like coconuts and lemongrass. This tasted like water. The peanut noodles were the correct consistency but the sauce resembled those cheap sauces in the microwave Thai meals you can buy at the supermarket - too much vinegar and mustard and not enough peanut and spice. I tried a bit of my friends' yellow curry and it was equally abhorrent. It tasted like they took a bottle of yellow mustard and threw in a few chili peppers and that was it. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.",

Dirt cheap price-to-portion ratio, convenient to campus, and good food (albeit with some land mines on the menu). My roommate always got noodles, or the ma po tofu. I never got in to noodles as much, and had several staples (including the ma po tofu) within the entrees. The pork was my meat of choice. The other meats were hit or miss.  The bubble tea and smoothies were also pretty good. The tapioca was usually cooked correctly. One of the drink-makers once concocted me a milk tea with a bit of coffee in it which was incredible. I can get better bubble tea in Houston but this was the best I had in Pittsburgh.  Four stars once you figure out your list of things you like here.",

My boyfriend and I ordered drinks (waters, diet coke) and then quite a while later, the waitress returned to take our food order without bringing drinks. A good while passed during which no one even came to check on us so that we could remind them that we needed drinks, then our food arrived. Without drinks.  I ordered a vegetable dish in which tofu is offered as a replacement for meat. The dish arrived with about four small pieces of tofu. The vegetables were bland and salty. I left hungry.  The prices aren't bad, but it really shows in the quality-- it's not one of those hole-in-the-wall, well-kept secret type place. There is a reason why the prices are cheap. The food is not plentiful nor high quality, and the service is terrible. The only thing really going for it is the bubble tea.  I'm really laid back about waitresses being busy, but there were not many people in the restaurant. And we didn't get our drinks until our meals were nearly finished.",

My favorite meal has always been the Wonton Noodle Soup accompanied by an egg roll. The egg roll was fine, but the soup was totally different. I couldn't even eat the wontons because they tasted off. I'm not saying the meat was bad, even though, maybe it was, but more so that they changed something about the flavor. I still have hope that it was a fluke, and that my favorite restaurant will come back to be just as great as it used to be.",

This is where I usually end up when I'm in the area and if none of the near by asian restaurants (especially Little Asia) are open and don't feel like driving around.

As for the food - Korean Fried Rice, Oriental Greens and the Pepper Steak has been my favorite from most of what I've tried so far. General Tso isn't too bad either. Some of the small menu items like the \"Tom Khai Kai\" Soup, crab rangoons are pretty good. Since I usually order different items if I'm visiting the same place again - I got the \"Schezwan Chicken\" during my last visit. Turns out - it was a bad choice. The dish was salty and very bland.  Overall, this is a decent and reasonably priced asian restaurant. I would recommend it if you're looking for something quick.",

I visited LuLu's for the first time in three years this weekend with a friend, and was not impressed. For starters, no one came to our table to even ask about drinks for nearly 10 minutes after we were seated. This was on a Sunday night, in the summer (i.e. when Oakland's main residents are gone), when the place was half empty. It was a bad start for the night, for the sure.  To the kitchen's credit, the food we ordered did come out very quickly - I think we waited about 10 minutes for it. But it was tasteless compared to what it used to be. Or rather, mine was; my friend had no complaints about her chicken and rice dish. My BBQ pork soup, however, was really not good. The pork slices (the few that I got anyway) were the tastiest part of the meal. The broth was forgettable, though, and the noodles were so bland that I swore at times that my water had more flavor than my meal.  In addition to the meal putting my taste buds to sleep, the waitress continued to fail to impress me throughout the evening. For one thing, not only did she not take our drink orders promptly: she failed to bring a water that my friend ordered. She also did not check on us very regularly throughout the meal, which left us sitting and waiting for refills often. And after leaving us alone at our table for most of the night she screwed up our bills as well, and double charged one of us for both of our meals. We got it fixed, but after everything else that night we were not pleased.  I wish I could say that this experience was a fluke, but based on other reviews, this is the new norm. Sorry, LuLu's, but this is not a norm that I'm going to settle for - not when there's other cheap eats in the city!",

The others, included me, ordered at the counter. One of us had to pay up front but the rest of us didn't.  One person in my party received her food, then another received part of her order. I never received mine and when i went to the counter they said they'd forgotten my order and my friend's small dish.   Both of my items came out quickly after that and they were both cold. My friend had to go back to the counter AGAIN for the fourth time and we eventually got my friend's side dish and the other member's food, both very cold again.  No apology or acknowledgment from the staff and I still had to pay full price (after they messed up my check 3 times, of course). I left and was sick that night from the cold, bad food. It's a shame, I used to love Lulu's, but I'm never coming back.  Stay away!",

    "text": "I've worked in Oakland for nearly 15 years and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal at LuLu's.  While the experience and ambiance isn't always perfect, the food typically is.  In regards to the experience - it gets very busy at lunchtime, and rightfully so.  However, the line snakes through the restaurant and around the tables so it is often a chaotic dining experience.  They finally fixed the issue with the strong currents of cold (or warm, depending on the season) air that you used to burst in every time someone opened the door.    I almost always pick the spicy Szechuan noodles with tofu - these thin noodles are complimented with a tangy (and not really spicy) sauce with veggies and your choice of protein.  Other favorites are the Pad Thai and the Hawaii's fried rice.  My absolute favorite appetizer is the crab rangoon.  Fantastic!  Lulu's has relaxed a little with their policy of 'cash only at lunchtime' but I think they do still prefer cold hard cash but will take your debit card if you smile and say thanks.    They also have a nice variety of bubble teas if that's your thing.",

I honestly don't remember if it was cash only. I think I paid with credit card but they might have had a limit to the amount. For a meal, I'll hit it--no problem. For a bubble tea or something quick, I might not come here since it'll be cash only.  Food here was great! Service was peppy and the selections are awesome. I had my longtime favorite, yuntunmian and the broth was served on the side, which was novel. Hubby ordered the creamy Thai tea and crunchy egg noodles and we left full and happy. Portions are generous and prices are good! Presentation was nice and seating wasn't cramped or anything.  Students always get the best small eateries close by. Lucky!",

Sure, I can make better noodle dishes myself--but can I do it on my lunch break?  I have had both the Pad Thai and the Singapore Curry Noodles. What they lack in authenticity they make up in volume! I really enjoyed both dishes. There are vegetarian options for almost everything--you can get tofu instead of meat. The Szechuan green beans also look good, and I plan on getting that next time.  Do not go expecting a great \"restaurant experience.\" It's a very loud undergraduate-infested type of place. This is a delight best sampled between classes or as takeout.  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and I plan to take advantage.",

It's cheap pan asian food and sometimes you just got a hankerin for it.  The Tom Kha soup is tasty and while I usually get the Spicy Basil Noodles, I actually think they should call them \"Sweet, No Basil, Noodles\".  But for $6 something - I'm not going to complain.  They definitely cater to the demographic in the area, but if your around the area and looking for some inexpensive asian place rather than going to Subway's or Quiznos - then check it out.  It won't cost you much!",

It is very strange, as though customer service were an afterthought and the convenience of the owner is paramount. Hey what the heck... I guess they've got so many customers among the unquestioning that these comments don't matter.

I ordered a bubble tea and got tea without bubbles and when I asked, they said they were out of bubbles. But I watched several other teas with bubbles get delivered to tables while I drank my plain one. Our appetizers came out after our meal and they were soggy and inedible. The food is subpar and unimpressive. My mother's order was messed up and they did nothing to remedy it. The pad Thai was horrible. HORRIBLE. It didn't even taste like pad Thai-no nuts, no sauce, and full of tofu even though we specifically asked for no tofu. And to top it all off-no fortune cookies! Will never go back and recommend you don't even try.",

I ordered the schezwan chicken and instead if something spicy it was chicken in a super sweet red-colored (most likely food coloring) sauce. On another occassion, I tried the bi bim bop. Also not spicy and a little on the bland side but at least it was edible. Asian fusion should keep the essence of the dish and recombine it in innovative ways. In order to do this you should have some concept of how the original, traditional dish tastes and is prepared. Most of the lulu's cookbook was created by someone who has never tasted or set eyes on the original dish and has only read a description of the dish.",

The only negative thing is they offered me the wrong dish. I wanted pho with beef, but it was ramen with chicken, #NotEvenClose :0.  But I had it anyway. The ramen is much better than the average. At that time I thought they either run out of pho and chicken or they were just careless. Wait! How can a restaurant run out of beef? So now I am praying that the food is not from some previous order or somewhere more gross.  I would rate 4 stars for the ramen. Take one star out for the mistake. The most disgusting part is all my guess, so it would be unfair to be considered. But not going again.",

I had to wait in a longer line, but eventually I got my food.  I was looking for a dish with more vegetables, but the lady at the register told me that the Pad Tai and Chicken Curry dish had an equal amount of vegetables.  It would have been an extra $2.00 to get an additional vegetables, so I thought I would pass.  I ended up getting the Chicken Pad Tai, which I thought overall it was decent, but I've eaten better Pad Tai at a different restaurant.  If I come back here, I'm going to be prepared with cash on hand and will be looking for a chicken dish with more vegetables.",

The portions are generous, service has always been very good, and the food comes out very fast even on the busiest of nights.  But it seems like in recent years the typical college student crowd has drifted away.  The food is as good as ever, if not better, but some recent changes to the menu have taken away my favorite dishes.  The change from thin sliced beef to ground beef in the Chow Fun Beef broke my heart.  But my wife tried substituting pork in the dish, and it was actually even better than the original beef.  Their pad thai is my go-to.  We've probably been here 100+ times over the years, and I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience.  It's a great spot for an affordable, filling meal.  If you're looking for an authentic Asian cuisine, there are certainly better options out there.  Losing some menu favorites was disappointing, and the remaining menu is starting to feel somewhat dated to early 00's Asian with a twist.  But Lulu's continues to have all of the charm and strong flavors that have made it a favorite for years.",

I swear that their general tso's chicken used to be some of the best in the city, but on my recent visit the general tso's was terrible. Every piece of chicken was full of that super chewy inedible fat. Hardly any meat at all. Their boba tea was okay, but nothing great. I will say that the staff is extremely nice and service was prompt, so that's a plus. But I won't be returning.",

However, that doesn't mean you can't get a tasty, plentiful meal for a reasonable price.    You order and pay for your meal at the counter, get a number and then find a seat of your choice.  The food comes out to your table very quickly.  My go to meal is the Spicy Thai Basil which is filled with chicken, pea pods, basil and peppers over a bed of noodles.   It's really filling and pretty darn cheap.     Located right near Pitt and CMU, it's a busy place when classes are in full swing, and it's affordable for college students.  This isn't authentic Asian cuisine and if you are looking for that, this probably isn't the right destination for you, but if you are in the area regularly, it's a good stop for a quick lunch.",

Before I signed it, she asked me how much I would pay for the tip. I was stunned because the way she said it made me feel like I was silly and I've never been to a restaurant before. She saw I didn't reply to her so she started to speak in Chinese (we were Chinese and we both knew it, I don't know why she kept speaking in her poor English but that's ok). Then she told me I had to pay at least 15%. I don't know why she assumed I didn't know it. I think her attitude was very impolite, and even rude. I will never go there again.",

If you're in Oakland and in the mood for some greasy noodles (sometimes I actually am), Lulu's can be all right.  The menu is pretty clear on which dishes can be made vegetarian, which I appreciated.  I don't really expect authenticity with a Pan-Asian place, so I'd go with dishes that are less \"traditional,\" like the chow fun or the pan-fried noodles.  Big portions, pretty fast.  Don't think I need to mention the service here--other people have covered that.  It'd be nice, though, if when you ordered the taro bubble tea (non-smoothie), that they'd warn you that the drink came with taro bits.  I've never had a taro bubble tea anywhere else that wasn't smooth (other than the boba).  But I guess I shouldn't expect that, given the general quality of service here.",

The menu has many options and after trying many of them I have come to the conclusion that the food is half-assed in authenticity but more a place to grab something quick for college students who want cheap food without the fuss, and may not know of better restaurants. Slow bad service, kind of dirty, stale environment.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese food to begin with so I have gone for the noodle Thai dishes more often. I don't even know why I kept going back besides my ex really liked General Tso's chicken and would grab takeout on his way home from work.  These were all bland boring, nothing special and never ordered again. Sweet and sour chicken, shrimp-NO Spicy Basil- all spice, could taste nothing else Dr. Fu special-never get seafood here  Below were the items that were just OK. No complaints but no accolades either. Cucumber salad- not so bad Pad Thai-Frozen pad Thai is better Singapore Rice noodles- flavorless chicken, sauce do-able  Uhm so horrible, the meat was that chewy gristle kind that you spit out into the napkin. Sesame cold noodles-worms in peanut butter sauce Lard Nar Bbq pork-gummy noodles like eating mush Pho-worst ever nothing like good pho, bad broth  The bubble smoothies are really good except I can't stand the tapioca fish egg consistency.

I know a high school spanish teacher who is continually sniping at my enthusiasm for a few local Am-Mex dives because he's travelled to Mexico and knows what is \"authentic.\" As far as I see it, if it is food you can taste and digest, it's \"authentic.\" Plastic Grapes are not authentic, for example. Canned ravioli IS authentic.  Lulu's serves food of Asian origin, evolved to reflect the character of the proprietors and staff. It is from Pittsburgh, not Pyong Pinghu. And it's delicious. I couldn't give a cat's butt about faithfulness to it's heritage, not when I'm having little pleasure tremors as each bite of the szechuan bowl's peanutty cilantro goodness hits my tongue.  I've never had a bad dish here--no one in my family has. The soups are fantastic, especially the Tom Kha Kai. Even the mighty General Tso, Emperor of Inauthenticity, seems better here. My kid loves that stuff and--hells bells I'm not that proud--so do I. I always pinch a couple bites, and have noted that the chicken here is several steps above the skanky cuts most asian places use--no fat clots, no gristle and tendons, and that's saying something.  The frozen fruit drinks are fantastic. Mango are my favorites. The wife and kid #1 had pineapple and watermelon--pineapple tasted good, but the watermelon tasted just like an acutal watermelon, no \"wow\" explosion of taste.  Service was brisk, but not brusque.    Give it a shot. You won't be sorry.",

After reading some Yelp reviews, and comparing Lulu's with some other restaurants, we decided it was as good as any others and seemingly better than some in the area (Ali Baba, our first choice, isn't open on Saturdays).  I got Singapore Noodles, and my wife the Beef and noodles dish.  The service was fast, the food delicious (though mine was a bit light on the curry sauce and, upon mentioning this to our delightful waitress resulted in the dish being taken back to the chef, with the result of a nice amount of additional sauce added--they keep it light for American tastes, but I like it a bit heartier, and that's what I got after mentioning it).  The veggies in the Singapore noodles were done just right--crisp and tasty, with lots of chicken and shrimp, and other requisite goodies for that dish.  My wife said she really liked the Beef noodle dish, and gave me a taste--it was indeed yummy.  Next time we're downtown near Lulu's for lunch I think I'll try that one.  The place is bright and airy, with lovely modern surroundings, great wait staff, and clearly good food, and interestingly, not at all expensive for what you receive!  Great restaurant!  ...Next time too, I think I saw on the menu one of my old favorite Korean dishes: BiBimBop.  I suspect that'll be worth a try also.",

    "text": "This place just gives off mediocrity like a bad stench.  It was bustling when I stopped by here recently for lunch - must be the decent prices, quick service, large portions, and central location.  Lulu's is not a bad place, don't get me wrong, just don't expect authenticity or anything beyond normal Americanized Asian fast food.  I had the Friday lunch special - the \"chicken wing appetizer\" or whatever was noooo good, and consisted of 2 wings placed awkwardly on the same platter as me overdrenched beef szechuan.  Or, what I thought was supposed to be beef szechuan.  The funny thing is, there was no spice kick to it whatsoever.  The redeeming quality was my friend's seaweed salad, which was delicious!  Covered in yummy sesame oil.  I'm sure there are other hidden gems on the menu, but I didn't find any.  Come here if you're in the mood for a huge MSG kick during your class lunch break, if you're short on time or money, or if you just want to avoid the even-worse places in the area.",

If you are looking for a quick fix of salt, carbs, and oil, LuLu's is your best bet. The portions are pretty big, service is fast, and the food is relatively cheap. The lo-mein and singapore style noodles are pretty good.",

Lulu's has gone seriously downhill in the last few years.   Some lowlights of our experience:  - Had to ask for napkins twice to no avail. Finally had to get up from the table, walk to the counter, and fetch some myself. Hello, where's my waitress? - No cutlery came with our food, so had to ask for some. Chopsticks arrived 5 minutes after noodles did. - Beef pho was absolutely inedible - lukewarm, flavorless, disgusting. I had to send it back to the kitchen. If you've ever had real pho, don't get it at Lulu's. Best case scenario you'll be sorely disappointed, more realistic is that you'll want to gag and be sick at the table. - \"Pan-fried noodles\" are actually just an uncooked circular ramen brick covered in warm chicken and bok choy. I know Lulu's is catered towards the budget-conscious college crowd, but I could've saved more money and time just by buying a $0.25 packet of Maruchan from CVS and eating it straight from the bag.  The only tasty thing at Lulu's is the Sriracha sauce.",

It was a regular go-to lunch joint while I was in school in Oakland. The school days are behind me, but I still look for opportunities to go get a bite there when I can. I like their noodles, the rices, but the small plates are my fave. The pad thai is pretty decent (again, I don't know what authentic is, if it tastes good, I will eat it). The bubble tea, however, is not the best. The tapioca pearls are a little too hard for my liking. The actual tea part is delish!",

By using these metrics, I usually have had a good experience here (I've been maybe 3 or 4 times). Typically, I never am hungry enough to get a \"Big Eat\" from the menu, I just stick with one of the \"Small\" vegetarian meals and it suits me well. The last few times I've gotten the steamed vegetables with tufu, and a $4.25 a bowl you can't have many complaints. It's been a nice place to walk over to from work, and it's great that it's open until almost 10pm to serve the college crowds from Pitt and CMU. And definitely try one of the bubble smoothies at some point- they were all the rage when they came out a few years ago and are actually quite tasty (if overpriced).",

The few times I have been there I have found the food to be okay, nothing to write home about. The Pho was utterly terrible, and the various noodle dishes only passable. The biggest problem, though, has been with the service. You place your order at the counter, and they are supposed to bring it to you. Several times I've found myself forgotten and having to go back to ask where my food is.  All in all, it will do in a pinch if you're a CMU student, otherwise steer clear.",

So it looked like a great place for an evening snack (not really a late night place).   First the bad. I ordered the Korean bibimbap bowl with duck. The bowl was topped with kimchi and duck. The duck was greasy but tasty and the kimchi was a little dry. Beneath this thin layer of toppings was an iceberg size portion of rice. Too much rice. Now, I like rice, but I like rice with something to go with it. It's like eating plain bread, doesn't make sense, you need your pb & j to top your bread. Now the bowl was only $7, which explains all the rice, but still, give me something, anything, to sauce my rice.  Now the good. I had a mango smoothy and some scallion pancakes. The mango smoothy was made from fresh mangos and definitely hit the spot. I'd get a big gulp of that next time. The scallion pancakes were the thinnest pancakes I've had. I've had medium thickness (my moms pancakes), thick pancakes (little dragons in Columbus, OH) and now thin. I really enjoyed the thin, easier to munch on and you taste the salt and oniony-ness more. The mango smoothie and scallion pancakes each earned the 2 stars for Lulu's.   Maybe next time I'll just get mango smoothies and onion pancakes.",

She really wanted bubble tea, and I knew Lulu's had it and was close.  We each ordered bubble milk tea.  My daughter had the red bean, and I had the almond.  She ended up liking mine better, since the red bean had a very floral taste to it which she was not used to.  I traded with her, even though the almond was definitely better.  For food, I had the Pad Thai, and she had Sesame Cold Noodles.  My dish was not aesthetically appealing, but it tasted OK.  It was not spicy at all, so I added quite a bit of Sriracha.    Once again, my daughter wasn't very pleased with her selection, even though she said it was good.  She ended up eating half my plate instead, which  was fine by me, since the serving was large.  I did try her noodles, and they seemed OK.  The service was very good for us.  The server was concerned when my daughter didn't eat her food and offered to take it back, but we weren't that concerned about it.  I wouldn't recommend making a special trip to go to Lulu's, but if you're in the area and don't want to spend a lot of money, it will pass.  I will be opting for Crepes Parisienne down the street.",

Two - the Hot & Sour soup is nom Three - they had crispy noodle dishes!!!  I had the LuLu Pan Fried Noodles with pork. While I didn't really care for their pork, the pan fried noodles were deelish. I had these once in another Chinese restaurant in Durham, but I could never remember the name of the dish or how to describe it.

This last visit was on a Sunday afternoon and every single table was taken.  Even with the packed restaurant, our order was taken quickly and the food arrived not too long after.  The only service hiccup was in trying to get our check and some to go boxes for our leftovers.  For our family of 4, we ended up with: - Fried Wontons (kinda different, kinda good with the red bean filling) - Gyoza (never got one - the kids gobbled them up quickly) - Yeung Chow Fried Rice (the entree I ordered - very tasty, not too greasy, a little heavy on the onions) - Lard Nar BBQ Pork (my wife ordered this - I scored a bite and it was very good!)  I don't claim to be an expert on Asian cuisine (though I happen to be Asian myself).  Lulu's has a pretty expansive menu that covers quite a few different countries.

This place isn't what it used to be, and it shows. I haven't seen this place busy in a long time.  While our waiter was really attentive and had great suggestions during our visit today, they were out of bubbles for bubble tea and there was no toilet paper in the bathroom. When I went to ask another host about restocking the TP in the women's room, she tried to reach for the empty napkin holder to tell me to use those because they were out. Yikes. That's not something you want to tell a patron at a restaurant.  Here's the one entree I can still get behind: Order the chow fun with pork. It's very good.",

Due to it being the only place open, and today being a sunny and warm day, we decided to put caution to the wind and go for it.    Glad we did!  The ramen was very good.  We both got \"Soul Ramen\" and selected the pork dumpling to go with it.  It also had an intact hardboiled egg.  We had a bit of fun lifting it out of the bowl with chopsticks.  Somehow I had no trouble while my wife, who grew up using chopsticks, dropped it back in the bowl causing quite a splatter all over us and the table.  We laughed over that for a bit!!  It'll be our lasting memory of this place.  My only complaint is with the tea.  I simply ordered hot tea and when the bill arrived I was surprised to see I was charged for bubble tea.  Apparently that's the only tea they have and I simply didn't ask for any of the boba stuff.  Next time I'll just ask for water.",

I've been here when it's super packed and when it's not busy at all and the food is always consistent. Sauces, meats, veggies burst with flavor. A variety of noodles always cooked to perfection with tastes you'd expect from a noodle joint.",

I've been here multiple times over the years, and unfortunately, their vegetarian dishes have always been pretty bland. All my meat-eating friends have no complaints so that makes me think that they just can't serve a good veggie dish. I've tried everything from their fried rice to the pad thai but I'm usually unsatisfied. Very average quality food. I'm usually adding half the salt shaker to my meal to taste something.   This time around, I ordered the Tofu Teriyaki Bowl which is probably one of the better items on their menu that I've had. Portion size was very generous and the special soy sauce was delicious. The vegetables themselves were tasteless (and not fresh) so I had to drown them in the soy sauce to be tolerable. We also had their bubble tea which is usually very good but this time, it was so watery and bland. My experiences here have been very hit or miss; however, service is always great - friendly waiters/waitresses that are attentive and prompt when you have a request.",

The service isn't great, the food tastes less fresh than it used to, and I haven't even tried the bubble tea in so long, so I can't really review it, but when I used to get it, it was sub par compared to other local spots.  I always get Dr. Fu Noodles, though, and typically can't go wrong. It's a pretty plain tasting dish, but I like it with some soy sauce. Something about the pile of tiny noodles is addicting.   Overall, though, definitely not my favorite spot to go to anymore in Oakland, like it used to be. I would love to see them up their game again!",

I had the Thai Curry Chicken, which didn't have the depth of flavor most thai curries do, but it was passable.  The other people I went with had Lo Mein, which I didn't like at all, and Fried Tofu, which was fine.    Their service was great for me.  The woman who was serving us was nice, and she even split the check by person for us which many places don't do.

    "text": "Like other reviewers, I'm unimpressed by Lulu's Noodles.  I've been there once, and that was enough for me.  I ordered a noodle dish of some kind, and it was bland and salty, and the ingredients were sub-par.  It's a far cry for authentic Asian food, and, having traveled several times to East Asia, I know what that is.  I also ordered the bubble tea, which was decent--however, there's now another place half a block down where you can get that for take-out or eat-in.  Based on the quality of the food, I'm surprised that this place is always packed.  Then again, I suppose it appeals mainly to the college student crowd, many of whom care about inexpensiveness over food quality.  If you're on S. Craig and looking for somewhere to eat, give this place a pass.  There are several better options (see my Craig St. restaurant list).",

    "text": "Lulu's has long become a staple to the neighboring college community in Oakland due to it's prime location on Craig St. and the price.   However, the food is terrible. I've been to Lulu's on multiple occasions during my freshman days of college, simply because I was unfamiliar to the city and craved some Chinese food (or in this case anything \"asian\"). As I got more familiar to Pittsburgh and found better options, I stopped dining at Lulu's completely.  Until tonight after a moment of bad judgment, my boyfriend and I just wanted some normal fried rice, and would settle for mediocre Americanized \"asian\" food.   I must say though, that their service is impeccably speedy. Too speedy. Within seconds of being seated and not even have had the chance to open our menus, our waitress asked us to order.  We ordered Scallion Pancakes, Java Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai, thinking that they can't possibly mess these very simple dishes up. How wrong we were. The fried rice was tasteless, (I'm usually complaining about food being too salty), and the pad thai was colorless, and swimming in liquid-y sauce (also smelled really bad). The Scallion Pancakes were literally store-bought tortillas with pureed scallions, so strange.   I think what baffled me the most was that our waitress only finally reappeared to chuck our bill on the table, AS WE WERE STILL EATING. Nobody motioned for the bill, we still had food in our mouths and on the plates. Definitely made us feel very very rushed. Rude.  At least their beverages are okay.. most of their flavors are pretty artificial/powdery tasting, but whatever. Could use more bubbles though.   If you have any respect for Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, etc food, SKIP Lulu's. Please.",

As for the person complaining about the decor (noodle pictures)...do you really think they used the noodles from the kitchen?!?!  And took the pictures in the restaurant?!?!?!   Guess again...the pictures were taken in a studio and the noodles thrown away.   I would highly recommend Lulu's!",

    "text": "To the reviewer who complained they were never served at lunch: This must have been due to a major miscommunication / misunderstanding. Lunch does not include table service. You place your order at the cashier, get a number, then they bring the food out when it is ready. I'm surprised you were 'seated by a host', and I'm surprised someone after you was 'served immediately'. This almost sounds like you are reviewing a different restaurant! Or at the least, mistook someone's cafeteria tray with beverages and fortune cookies (served immediately by the cashier) for having been served. Any way, better luck next time.  It is problematic that newcomers are not informed of the lunch policy. There seems to be no one working as 'host' during lunch. It is also problematic that the menu is disorganized; grouped by size \"small eats\" \"big eats\" \"noodle bowls\" \"rice dishes\". Soups are all over the place, depending on whether you order a meal sized or appetizer sized soup. This would be ok during dinner when there is table service, but instead you have to rapidly scan the menu while waiting in line at the cashier. On the bright side: there seems to be no obligation to tip during lunch!",

    "text": "I personally love the bubble tea that Lulu makes so I'm a frequent customer. But today's trip to Lulu's was disastrous.  So I came to get 2 mango smoothie bubble tea today. It was ridiculous that I ended up waiting 40 minutes just for 2 bubble for to go. And when I received my order, it was 2 strawberry--not 2 mango.  I proceeded to tell the lady that she had my order wrong, but was told that she heard me say strawberry. Aside from the fact that mango and strawberry sounds nothing alike, she rudely insisted that I told her strawberry. I also did not appreciate the dirty attitude I was getting from her when I was trying to talk to her politely...  So after a while, it seems that my order was going to be fixed. But after waiting some more, I only received 1 mango and was given 1 strawberry despite telling her I ordered 2 mango, not 1 mango and 1 strawberry. This time, she was obviously being a b*tch asking, \"so are you going to take it the drinks or not?\"  Based on my past experience with other people there, I might come back. But if I do, I absolutely refuse to have her take my order  again.",

I'm glad that they finally changed their bubble tea menu that now allows you to choose options such as the kind of tea, different boba and juices that are available. You can even choose how much or little sweetener that you want in your tea. The food is sub-par.

So, go and try it but proceed with caution knowing that there are far better options out there for you.",

My wife and I arrived at 5:45 on a Friday night; we had tickets to see John Waters at the Carnegie hall across the street at 8:00.  Simple? NO!  We placed our orders; two noodle bowls and Pot Stickers.  Over a half hour later we asked the server where our food was, we noticed our order was still on her pad!  She lied and said \"soon\".  Twenty minutes later our Pot Stickers were placed on someone else's table.  We had to argue with the runner to get them on our table.  (BTW, they were TERRIBLE).  Still no food by 7:30.  We had to leave or miss the event.    So I go to the cashier; \"I will pay for the Pot Sticker but we must leave\".  I WAS HANDED A CHECK FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL!  I ask for the Manager.  I was ignored.  I start yelling.  I'm still ignored for ten minutes.  So we left. The John Waters event was ruined because we were so hungry.  ONE HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES!!

During lunch service you order at the counter and then you seat yourself. Luckily we were able to order before a big rush came in.  The decor has not changed much since I use to go here as a kid so it kinda has dingy/old vibe to it. However, I still love the noodle pictures that line the walls.  I ordered the pork lo mein and it was pretty good and priced about what is average for an inexpensive Asian restaurant. I remember that several years ago they had lunch specials that were a great deal. However, it seems like they do not have lunch specials anymore which was disappointing.  If you're looking for something sweet definitely try their smoothie. It was delicious!  Overall, an affordable pleasant spot to have lunch in Oakland.",

The sauce they give you is duck sauce with some hot mustard in it.. and it just works! My bubble tea was so good too! For my entree, I ordered a dish that is basically chicken and green beans in a brown sauce. That was so good too!

    "text": "Talk about a blast from the past for me on my recent trip to Lulu's.  That can be taken two ways by the way, and I will explain.  Upon arriving in Pittsburgh after college, Lulu's use to be a spot that I always would hit up.  Living in Squirrel Hill made it convenient for my visits.  It was the place to be, when someone said Chinese food in the city, you automatically thought of this place.  Then on the other hand, this place feels trapped in the past.  Walking in here after years of dining elsewhere, nothing has changed.  Evident of that is the layer of dust on some items.  All I am saying, don't look up.  The dining area is basically the same as well.  What has changed is the way they do business.  Or maybe it was because I was here for a late lunch.  I'm not sure.  But before you were shown to a seat, now I had to do most of the work myself.  Confused me at first.  No one at the door or a sign to tell you what to do, so I just stood there for a few minutes until I approached the counter.  Ordered my food and was given a tray with a number on it, cafeteria style.  Now, the food, that has not changed.  And that is not a bad thing one bit.  I loved what I had and what was always my go to item here.  I got the General Tso's Chicken and a vegetable roll.  They sure do give you a lot of food, so much so that I took about half of it with me on the way out the door.  Not too spicy, and it filled my gut with some warmth.  I absolutely love the vegetable rolls they have here.  And what makes them better is combo sauce they give you.  I know it's nothing more than duck sauce with hot mustard dropped in it, but for some reason it's what makes the vegetable roll so much better.  Customer service needs a little work here.  I am also concerned that this place may not be here much longer, it's a bit deserted at times.",

We were in the area and stopped and it wasn't the same LuLus I remembered. We both ordered vegetable egg rolls, but when they arrived, they were still frozen inside.   They added mustard to the duck sauce which we personally don't care for.   I went specifically for Singapore Rice noodles, which online still showed that they offered, so I was disappointed when it was no longer offered.   I got the Pad Thai, which was good and my bf got the crispy fried noodles which wasn't what he expected, but it was good.   The service was quick and friendly, the prices were reasonable and it was fun to return to an old favorite place.",

    "text": "I just had my first Lulu's and I think that three stars is pretty accurate overall for the experience I had.   First of all, the convenience is awesome. You can order on Tapingo and pay with Panther Funds, which is a great way to save a few bucks -- or at least not spend any money you haven't already set aside. I ordered on the app and my order was ready in less than ten minutes, and since I live close the total time between my order and taking a bite was less than twenty minutes. Can't beat that.  The actual food is good but leaves some things to be desired. I ordered the Hong Kong Chow Fun, and the noodles were awesome -- panfried, chewy, carby deliciousness. Exactly what I wanted. The green onions and regular onions were perfectly cooked; the flavor was there but didn't overpower the overall dish's flavor. The only problem was the beef. It was ground beef, which I've never seen at a Chinese restaurant and it honestly skeeved me out a little bit. It still tasted fine (if a little chewy in places, as ground beef is wont to be), but based off of pictures I expected strips of beef which I'm much more used to. The portion size is GIANT. I was pretty freaking hungry and I still couldn't finish it, which is great since my goal as a college student is to stretch every meal eaten out into two.  I also ordered a black bubble tea with taro flavoring and no milk. They were out of regular boba so I believe I was given popping lychee boba instead. This was still fine -- I've never tried the popping boba before but I didn't mind it. However, the actual tea is just kind of lackluster. Also it was greyish, which is pretty unappealing. It looked a bit like I was drinking dirty dishwater. That being said, it's not the worst bubble tea I've ever had and I'm drinking it no problem.  Overall, Lulu's is a convenient student eatery with good prices, but the cutting corners behind those deals is apparent in some places. The huge portion sizes make it worth it to come here every so often, but it's far from the best Chinese in the area.",

The egg roll was good but very salty. The broth in the soup was spicy, I like spicy but wasn't expecting it as the menu didn't state anything about it. Otherwise, there wasn't much flavor to the broth. The veggies were bland and I think the dumplings were just tofu.  My friend got a rice bowl and wasn't thrilled either.  The place was also dingy and the area behind the counter was dirty. Sadly, I won't be going back.",

It is not at all the same ramen noodle soup. Other items on the menu are also completely different.

The soup was good but the pad thai was not as awesome as I remembered it to be. I used to order flats of pad thai to serve at parties I loved it so much. This time, it tasted lacking and bland. The Korean bi bim bap with beef not as good as at Korean food only restaurants, more like the fast food version with ground beef and hard boiled egg.   I think it's time to shake out the sheets and freshen the whole place up. The location is great and service is fast. The pictures on the walls I thought so cool are now faded and need to be updated, much like the weird dance club music from the '90s you insisted on blasting at 11 am.    Your prices are still great and I don't want to give up on you after all these years, but after my last trip there, I'm in no hurry to go back and will be sure to read recent Yelp reviews before I return. Good luck. I'm rooting for you.",

The pad thai was still a large serving but noticeably smaller than it used to be (I could get 3 meals out of it, now it was more like 1 1/2) and there were only 2 slivers of tofu on the entire dish.

    "text": "Okay. Driven to come here twice in the past couple of weeks.  DEFINITELY a 1 in my book.  Got gyoza and wonton soup here once. I used to love their shrimp wontons and their broth, but this time the shrimp had this horrible rancid taste to it (definitely not fresh) and the broth was spicy! Why was the wonton soup spicy?! It was never spicy before.  All I could taste was that it was strangely spicy. The gyoza were soggy and flat. They seem like they were seared ahead of time and frozen/set aside and then heated up somehow. That's what the texture is like. Nothing is crispy. At least the sweetened soy dipping sauce is good (hah).  Most recently, I had a sampling of 5 egg rolls, general tso's chicken, the bbq pork appetizer, more gyoza, and tom kha kai. 3 of the 5 egg rolls came out super completely dark brown - looked overcooked. And how do you mess up general tso's chicken?... it was really really dry and the sauce was ...I don't know really really overly sweet and not good at all. I couldn't even stomach one piece of it. The gyoza came out less flat and soggy this time, but still not crispy. I'm convinced they don't pan fry these fresh to order, but it tasted better than last time. The bbq pork was absolutely dry and disgusting. The tom kha kai is good on its own as a soup imo, but unrecognizable from what you'd expect it to be. In fact, I ordered it, got it and tasted it, and forgot that it was what I had ordered until now. Had I remembered what to expect, I think I would've thought less of it. It was missing any coconut flavor and wasn't super balanced or fragrant like I should be, but it had a good spicy kick that really saved it. Not spectacular, but compared to everything else it was really the highlight of my meal.  My friends think I'm just picky for not liking this place and that I just don't like americanized Chinese food, but I don't know... I really like little asia across the street and OE down the block, but I'm totally convinced that I should not eat here anymore. I'm actually really sentimental about this place having come here for so long and I want it to be good, but I really need to stop wasting money here.",

The inside felt like the inside of a old undergrad cafeteria struggling to look modern and urban. The wall that we were placed against at our two-seater was filthy. The wall had brown stains spotted throughout; it looked like someone had a bad case of the runs while eating. The customers were your typical undergrad crowd looking for inexpensive eats.  The waitress was soft spoken and knew little about the food and how it tasted or what was in it. There wasn't a whole lot of service here outside placing your order. It seemed like the people were frustrated to be working here.  The food was mediocre with some good in it. We ordered the bim bim bop and the schezuan chicken noodles. The bim bim bop had overdone eggs and chicken which added an unpleasant bland rubbery texture. The schezuan chicken had something similar; bland flavor, rubbery, and not spicy.   And the good... as it states in their title, Lulu's noodles.  The noodles were good, not great, but enough to validate the restaurants title. The other good thing was the Sriracha sauce because without it there was absolutely no spice in this food.   My girlfriend took me here since her last visit 2 years ago, and this maybe the next time I come back.",

    "text": "Service: I wasn't sure about LuLu's when I arrived. The hostess was impatient and raised her voice when inquiring if we wanted a table even after we have confirmed that we did. We were seated promptly and provided with utensils and waters with our orders taken pretty quickly afterwards. We waited a while for the bill which took multiple promptings, but eventually were able to pay and leave. Although it was good for a quick meal, it was not a particularly satisfying dining experience.  Food: It was a skeptical moment to see such a wide variety of dishes at such low prices because quality becomes a factor (dishes between $6-$8). Skepticism was confirmed when the meals arrived. I ordered the Thai Curry Chicken and was not particularly impressed with the dish. It had the richness from the coconut milk, but it was a bit too sweet and the green beans tasted strange (as if old and past its freshness date). Onions were undercooked and chopped too largely that it conflicted with the texture of the dish. All in all, it was way off the mark. My brother ordered an udon dish with beef, but I was surprised to see that they added ground beef bits in it instead of slices  which to me communicated poor attention to details and choice of ingredients.   Atmosphere: Very loud and chattery. Great for college students, large groups and families, but definitely not for a first date sort of deal or for lunch meetings (much too loud). Fake Asian decor and some aspects of the upkeep of the place were questionable (peeling wallpaper covered with plexi-glass bolted to it)",

The Pad Thai and the Spicy Sechewan are good dishes too.  Their appetizers are good and cheap too.   I would recommend going here over Oriental Express every day unless you are in a hurry.  Lulu's service can be horrible sometimes.  Once the waitress didn't realize she was our waitress and left us sitting there for 15 minutes.  Lulu's does have the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh though.  I like Classic the most.  But I figured out the smoothies are the best bang for your buck because they aren't 50% ice like the bubble teas sometimes are.

Some people don't like Taro chunks in theirs. I don't mind them but I also prefer Orient Express's Taro tea anyway.

The prices are awesome, everything on the menu that I've had (about half of it) is good, and you never have to wait for a table. It is True that the service can be sluggishly slow, but considering how good the food is, who cares? Waiting to get the check is the worst part. It has almost taken 20 minutes at times.  What to try: Spicy Basil, Lard Nar BBQ Pork, Hot and Sour Soup, Bubble Tea  -1 Star for service.",

I fell in love with both Bubble Tea and Tom Kha soup at Lulu's.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I know it's not a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars in my heart.  Lulu's has never let me down, and as long as I live in Pittsburgh, I will always keep going back.",

    "text": "Sunday lunch at Lulu's - after working in Oakland for two years and eating there only during weekdays at lunch, who knew that Lulu's actually has sit-down service during the daytime? I didn't, that's for sure, so I was surprised to see a bit of a line forming near the entrance at 1:30 on a Sunday.  No problem, as we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival.  Now you don't go to Lulu's for good service. You don't go to Lulu's for the dining \"experience\" that other restaurants offer. You probably don't go expecting an \"authentic\" menu. You go for tasty food, served quickly and hot.   Spicy basil noodles with chicken, on this visit, hit the spot just as they have on every other visit I've made. In fact, I love it so much that I hate to order anything else from the menu because I'm afraid to miss out on the vermicelli noodles steaming with carrots, snow peas, red and green peppers, etc. The sauce is sweet and salty, and could be spicier but I'm afraid to doctor up the plate with the red pepper sauce they have on each table for fear of ruining the dish.  The crowd is nice on a Sunday, relaxed but not lethargic. Our server was polite, took our orders quickly, and stopped once during our meal to make sure everything was ok.   A word about takeout - I've only ordered it once from Lulu's and it was a remarkable disappointment. The food took forever to come out (30 minutes or so) and the balance of noodles to sauce to veggies and chicken was off because it was prepared in the to-go container rather than on a plate. I learned my lesson and now I'll only dine in.",

I kept it really simple and had white rice and some steamed veggies, which did have a little bit of a sauce on them. They had a nice flavor, and I left with about a $10 bill (including an iced tea).  When I tried to pay with a credit card, the woman said, \"Don't you have cash?\" I looked at her in complete bewilderment. Who the hell says that to a customer?! Clearly she was feeling stressed out, so rather than make a scene I decided to part with a few greenbacks.  I'd like to go again and try out the eat-in option to see if they'll do better next time.

Also, it felt like a college cafeteria: the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance, hip-hop, and rock songs. So I'm getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music. I could barely hear my wife right across the table. There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere. Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us.   The food was greasy, yet satisfying.

But a quick tip on the delivery, it's a third party company that charges not only a large delivery fee but also increased menu prices.  But like I said, the food was better than your average Chinese food restaurant.  The moo shoo pork came with a BBQ soy sauce that was pleasantly surprising and something I've never gotten with moo shoo before.  The egg rolls were larger than I expected and the wonton soup was very tasty; seasoned well and better than just broth and wontons.  Would definitely recommend Lulu's but it's a little out of the way for Pitt students, especially in the winter and if you're going for delivery it can get a bit pricey.",

This was our go-to after-school spot in high school post-Model UN practice (here I am revealing that I'm a huge nerd) when we didn't feel like risking the dietary aftermath than can happen at the O. The crab rangoons are fabulous--a crispy crust with boiling-hot cream cheese in the middle that is just sweet enough. I also like the cold sesame noodles, the big bowl of wonton noodle soup, the stir-fried beef noodles, and the fried tofu. Their most popular seller is apparently the General Tso's chicken, but it's too sweet for me. I also tried the Dr. Fu's special noodles (a mystery dish with no item description, but my dad works with the eponymous Dr. Fu so I felt a need to try them) and it was essentially stir-fried egg noodles with chicken, bean sprout, and hoisin. Decent, but too greasy for me. Sorry Dr. Fu!  Like previous reviewers mentioned, it's counter service for lunch and table service for dinner--let the long line of Oakland university types waiting in line at lunch be your guide. They don't really serve dessert but you can go across the street to Kohli's and get gulab jamun or kulfi on a stick if you're still hungry, though I rarely am!",

We were always seated relatively quickly and the food came out quickly as well. In a place like this I don't ask for much else.

Some students will rave about Lulu's, but it is nothing too special.  I've had the Spicy Szechwan Noodle Bowl and the Spicy Basil Noodle Plate; both were fine. I've also tried the bubble tea which is a unique beverage to try.   I've never had any problems with service here either.",

I visited Lulu's for a group lunch for work and, yes, they can accommodate a large party of people but that is meaningless if the food is substandard.",

The food was lukewarm; it was unlikely it was made to order. I ordered Thai Lemon Beef on noodles. As soon as I saw it, my appetite disappeared. It was a plate of noodles drowned in goop. Although the noodles, beef, and vegetables tasted okay, I had a very difficult time trying to remove as much sauce as possible. My dad finished my plate for me; I couldn't bring myself to eat the last few noodles that were positively swimming in the sauce.",

I took some friends this weekend, and was almost embarrassed to have made the recommendation.  The decor was strange-the large posters of people covered in noodles that had seemed edgy before now just seem sad and dated.  The service was just ok-friendly, but slow, and our silverware was just thrown onto the center of the table for us to fight over.   My spicy Szechuan noodle bowl was not only not spicy, it had hardly any flavor except forthe fresh cilantro garnish.  I had to drench it in Sriracha to make it edible.  The noodles were all sticky and clumped together.  Even my beloved crab rangoons were not nearly as good as I remembered-too sweet...much more of a dessert than an appetizer.  I wish I never would have went back and would have let this place remain a fond memory from my college days.",

Anyways, we had planned on heading to Union Grill, but its still under construction :( I asked my friend how lulu's was & she gave a long, confused \"It's ok\" & a weird look. Since 3 outta the 4 of us hadn't been here, we decided to try.  There was no wait to be seated but a good 10-15 minutes until our server came.. which was weird since she also seated us. The menu looked like basic pork, chicken beef or duck dishes served over rice or noodles. We all ordered the teriyaki chicken rice bowl (weird, huh?) It didn't take long for it to come out but it was just weird how hot the rice & bowl were compared to chicken. Do they stick the bowl in the oven/microwave once ordered?  After the cook or whatever served our food, no one checked if we needed anything. My cup was empty forever before she finally came over& by that time she asked if we were ready for check. I guess you're supposed to take your bill/money to the register & we didn't know that. We just left everything on the table after waiting forever for her to head back. If you're not serving the food, refilling drinks or taking the bill what is the point of having servers?! Also was disappointing to hear them turn away customers at 9:40 because the kitchen was closed.. not 945 or 950. 940  Overall food was crappy. My friend didn't eat half of his because the chicken resembled pork & the floor was so dirty as if they only sweep at closing time. No thaaaanks ill make my own chicken & rice at home.  I tried :\\",

On top of that they forgot my ice tea and my gyoza. I was asking for the gyoza cause I was so hungry, but I skipped the ice tea cause I couldn't be bothered. The gyoza didn't taste much either and on top of that the soy sauce/vinegar mix tasted so sweet that I couldn't eat it. All in all I left so unimpressed that I won't be returning.",

Rather than expanding into Japanese and Korean cuisine, they should focus on getting better at Chinese first.  I ordered a Mango & Strawberry Jasmine Green Tea Boba with Normal sweetness. The drink was completely syrup based with no mango fruit and only small remnants of strawberries. It was too sweet, and I recommend all future customers to go light on the sugar. For $3.75, it is overpriced.  As for the entree, I had the Dr. Fu special. It comes with thin egg noodles, chicken, scallions, and bean sprouts with a side of hoisin sauce. The dish was mediocre. Traditionally, Chinese stir fry comes with 1/3 noodle, 1/3 vegetables, and 1/3 protein (meat). The Dr. Fu special had too much noodles and lacked any vegetables.

I also get the spicy schezuan (ask for light on the sauce) and I put sriracha in that too, but the chicken texture is weird. I also get it without the cilantro/parsely because I don't think the earthy taste of the herb is a good compliment to the schezuan.   Everything else I have tried there (because my friends got it) I did not like at all, such as: Pad Thai (worst Pad Thai I have ever had) and Dr. Fu's Special (it was kind of a tasteless white sauce)  The only thing I don't like about their fruit smoothies is that there's too much artificial flavoring in it.  I usually get strawberry/lychee or coconut/lychee - but these are things you can make on your own using fresh fruits and no funky food colorings.  The service is generally horrible.  I don't know a delicate, yet direct way to say it, but it's rare to get decent service.  It's slow and just... annoying.",

Hubby and I decided on a pork and chicken entree respectively, which were both surprisingly good, considering how inexpensive they were.  You also get more than enough food to satisfy a ravinous appetite, which we both had.  The \"kids\" had the General Tso chicken and a terriyake chicken dish which they proclaimed were deelish!  LuLu's also had a nice selection of fruit smoothie style drinks, and they looked yummy.  Atmosphere is a litte frantic and the place is quite noisy, so it's not the place for a date, but if you are hungry, don't have a lot of dough and want something quick and tasty, LuLu's is a very good bet!",

My favorite: mango ice with bubbles and no sugar. Request no sugar if you don't want to be overwhelmed by sweetness! It's really good as it is. They use fresh fruit and everything. The smoothies are a little too heavy IMHO because they mix in icecream, but the ices are so good, especially on a hot day. And the bubbles are so fun to chew on!

    "text": "I have flown 3,000+ miles to eat at LuLu's.  OK, that's not exactly True.  BUT I am from Pittsburgh.  I went to college at Carnegie Mellon.  I ate here a LOT in college and whenever I go home to visit I insist we eat here - multiple times.  I have dragged my husband and son here up to 3 times in a week-long visit.  We still have a few college friends in the area so there is still the chance to meet at LuLu's and really make it feel like old times.  I love the food but I will admit part of the appeal is that chance to relieve one's prime...  who knows.  I love their pho (either with chicken or veggies/tofu) and their thai curry chicken (either with chicken or tofu).  They have no problem making either one without onions - good for me because I am picky.  Love their fried red bean won tons.  Love their bubble drinks which I think are fairly new - they didn't have those when i was in college.    Love their slightly engrishy menu - I think it's the hot and sour soup where they claim \"And wow!  is it good?\"  Love the goofy pictures on the walls of the kids and noodles - wonder what those kids are up to now?  So weird to go there and know they're getting old just like the rest of us but there they are, young and covered in noodles.  Good times, good food.  Yeah the service can suck - we call it the LuLu's experience to note how the food never all comes out at one time so one person will be finishing as another is just getting their food - and if you ask for water to drink, it tastes like it came out of the hose.  But I love LuLus and no trip to Pittsburgh would be complete without at least one meal there.",

    "text": "Giving it another star.  The honey chicken has to be the best tasting fried chicken I've ever had.  I'm also in love with the beef chow fun.  I'm definitely coming back to try out other dishes.  This place won't ever get 5 stars from me though.  I went back a few times and one time I remember the place being horrible messy.  Granted, it was a bit busy but having food all over the floor isn't acceptable.  A group of people got placed at a table with bunch of food on the ground.  They reluctantly sat there.  I definitely know I wouldn't have.",

Other than that, the dishes are delish, the portions are huge, and the menu has a great variety. Yes, the food is a little greasy (but thus very tasty), and the service is hit or miss... Still, for those of us who were/are students in the Oakland area, Lulu's is a beloved staple.",

I had the greens with shrimp - basic, simple, satisfying. The melon tea was waaay to sweet for me, and didn't really seem like tea. My big issue with this place is that it is loud as hell. I could hardly hear myself think.",

What would Craig Street be without Lulu's? Heck, what would PITTSBURGH be without it? They have a range of different menu items, but I mainly stuck with their noodle dishes. Love their beef lo mein and their crab rangoons. The owner, Mr. Yan, is the nicest guy ever, and graciously helped out the student organization I was a part of when we ran a bubble tea fundraiser to help Hurricane Katrina victims. I actually came to him second, after the mean lady at Rose Tea refused to help us out.",
