When we ordered we   were told a couple of items would take a little bit but that was OK.  So we waited and waited.   We waited and waited. 70 minutes after our order, two dinners came out.  10 minutes later 3 dinners came out.  Finally, after 90 minutes the sushi and last 2 dinners came out.  The Miso soup was served first and was not warm enough.  A couple of people called in for take out and came to pick it up and waited for long periods, one was given a bowl of Miso soup while she waited.   The food was good but the wait was over the top.   The place is loud, the ventilation fan has a very high hum and made it hard to hear someone talking if you were at one end of the table and they were at the other end of the table. Probably should just do take out and be ready to wait.",

    "text": "This is a cute little BYOB korean/sushi place in Mount Lebanon. To my utmost surprise and delight, the menu had a whole vegetarian section with options from veggie ramen to udon, bibimbap, potstickers and veggie rolls. I tried the veggie ramen and veggie summer roll, both of which I loved. There's something about the food, perhaps the freshness of the produce or the ingredients that induce a 'home-made' quality to the food here. The  portions are quite generous and each order comes with miso soup. I ended up boxing most of my roll because the ramen was really filling. The service is incredibly sweet and polite. I'd highly recommend this place and I definitely intend to come back to try some of the other rolls and the bibimbap. They also have kimchi burgers!! My favorite thing was this a video they had playing on their large lcd display of a warm crackling fire which I found incredibly cute! Hey.. it's the next best option to the real thing..and you don't even have  to deal with the smoke and kindling!! An extra gold star for that touch!! :)",

    "text": "After Easter break I had an empty fridge and I was bored with the usual take-out/delivery options, so I decided to wander over to Mt. Lebanon Blvd., where I'd been seeing a mysterious \"Sushi\" sign for the past few months. I found out it was a Japanese/Korean fusion restaurant, which suited my need for \"different\" since I've only had Korean once before, and that was over a decade ago.  The strip along Mt. Lebanon Blvd. is weird - a mix of '70s fab strip mall on one side of the road with some run-down, block-like storefronts and some new, attractive office buildings invading the aging commercial space on the other side. It's an awkward, car-centric block in a neighborhood that is mostly walking-friendly. Oya Sushi is in a recently renovated older building, which means that the frontage of some of its neighbors is still a work in progress.   Inside Oya Sushi it was cool and soothing, with lovely background music. Tables are along one wall and there is a long sushi counter in the center of the space with hanging decorations to block your view of the kitchen (which takes up the other half of the restaurant). There was one middle-aged man sitting in the back wearing a business suit quietly finishing up a bowl of something. If I hadn't known it, I would thought I'd stepped into a restaurant in the middle of Little Seoul or Little Tokyo, so complete was the transition.  I chose blindly from the menu, picking out bibimbap, kimchi jeon, and a seafood sushi roll. I had fun peering between the hanging flags that said \"SUSHI\" to watch my food cooking at the stove. After a short 10 minutes my take-out was ready. Everyone was friendly and the chef popped his head around the front of the counter to thank me on my way out the door.  Let me first say that everything was well-sealed. I'm always a little panicked when I drive take-out home, and even when my bag fell over in the car, nothing spilled or tipped out, which was a relief.   I opened up my bag and found that they had given me a 4 oz. serving of miso soup, which I was pleased about because I love miso. I started with the spicy shrimp roll I'd purchased, and was really happy with the quality. The shrimp was legit spicy, and everything had been freshly made while I waited, which always gives a basic roll a superior mouth-feel. Then I opened up my miso soup, which was the perfect temperature to just drink. It was delicious and I wished for more as soon as my bowl was empty. Not too salty, just the right consistency - I loved the miso.  Then I moved onto the kimchi jeon, which is a pancake made with pickled cabbage. I decided that I haven't found a pancake yet that I don't like (buckwheat, scallion, dosa, crepe, etc.). This did not disappoint - the homemade kimchi was delicious and the pancake was huge and perfectly crispy.  The last item was the bibimbap, which was very good. it's wasn't great, which is where my four (and a half) stars come in for the review. The ground meat was a bit dry and I found there was a bit too much rice, which I ended up pitching after I'd finished eating up all of the veggies, egg and meat. I really enjoyed the red sauce that came with the bibimbap, and it definitely finished off the dish. I will say that the veggies were all very fresh and cut right there after I ordered. There's something to be said for fresh, wholesome food. But after reading about the hot stone pot version with its crispy rice, I wish I'd upgraded to that, as it sounds like it might have been amazing.    I also wish I'd ordered some ramen, because after I was finished I really wanted something souplike to top things off. Oh, and maybe I should have ordered potstickers, because I'm always a fan of potstickers and the quality of a restaurant's basic recipes like that always tells me how good it is. Of course, I'm stuffed right now so I wouldn't have been able to eat it all, so that just means I'll have to go back to try the rest of it another time!",

    "text": "My first time here was around 8:30 PM Monday January 30th. I ordered a rainbow roll and some tea. The rainbow roll was delicious and well presented. I can't wait to try their other sushi items because the rainbow roll was so good. I also ordered spicy chicken to go and some chicken potstickers. When I got home I just had to taste my takeout items which were supposed to be for tomorrow. Wow , I had to force myself to stop eating. The food is good. I saw some other reviews that indicated they didn't have tables, they are wrong now. They have plenty of tables. I will definitely be back for more. Bon appetit I just finished one of the best meals I've had in months. Chef James prepared for me the authentic Korean Version of BIBIMBAP . What I mean by authentic is that it was prepared with the crispy rice in the bottom of the proper hot bowl and topped off with an egg and his special sauce to pour over it to make it even more spectacular. Other restaurants make this dish however they just make it in a regular bowl and do not crisp the Rice the way it's supposed be prepared. They also don't have the intricate level of flavors that Chef James and his brother John puts in their dish. If you want to experience this dish you must ask for the authentic version. It does cost a little more however it's well worth it. Don't be in a hurry just come and relax enjoy some tea or soup and conversation until your food arrives. This is not a fast food restaurant, Everything is prepared from scratch so if it's crowded it may take some time. The sushi is great and so are the many other dishes on the menu.I normally don't write long reviews,but this time I'll make an exception since the food was exceptional.",

Their sushi is so-so. It's hard to get good fresh fish around here so I give them a break, but I think if you want to taste something very special, you should really try something Korean from their menu.  Service is fast and nice, too. Good place for a little date or something.  I really want to try BBQ here but they don't have the set-in BBQ grills, I think they have to bring it to your table and I don't like that as much.  If they did an all-night Korean BBQ I would be so happy.",

My daughter and I usually share it. BYOB which is common here with Asian places, but if you get your food to go there is a distributor right next door with a nice front patio where you can enjoy your rolls on a cool Autumn evening. The barbeque menu is wonderful as well and always evolving. Great place to dine if you aren't in the mood for a sandwich with fries on it.",

Now then, Service here is great, it wasn't busy while we were here so drinks came out right away, food was brought out as soon as it was done cooking. (You can actually hear them cooking! It's quite nice.) The chef is very, very nice and came out to speak with us about our food. He's very polite, and asks for criticism both good and bad so he can improve his cooking. He also took the time to explain sushi to my younger sibling! Over all, wonderful service.  Food wise: AMAZING! I got the Galbi Bento, and as a fan of Korean food this was some of the best I've had. Gyoza? Perfectly fried and delicious. Sushi? Fresh and delicious. Overall, everything is absolutely delicious and my family will definitely be coming back. Portion sizings are just right, and you will leave feeling full, rather than stuffed till you're sick like some restaurants can leave you feeling. Per person, my family spent 15$ a person. This was 3 bento entrees, their hibachi-chicken rice entree, and an order of Gyoza for the table. For such good food, this is a great price point.  Side note: HUZZAH! A place with Korean food that's affordable and in the South Hills! I highly suggest !",

    "text": "The restaurant has tables now! I went for my third visit yesterday and was just as pleased as always. I tried the gyoza ramen and their sushi (the spicy scallop) for the first time. The ramen was full of vegetables and the broth was delicious. The dumplings were really flavorful. I once tried the ramen up the street at Little Tokyo and was really disappointed - this was nothing like that. I would recommend the ramen here!  The spicy scallop roll was really fresh and delicious. I was happy to see that their spicy roll does not mean that they chop up the fish into a weird mayo salad situation - the scallop was intact and soft and tasted great. The roll was NOT covered in sauce, which I feel is a problem with a lot of Pittsburgh sushi places. If you are so inclined to drown your sushi in sauce, there was a beautiful display of sauce on the side. I included photos. The presentation was nice - they shaped my wasabi into a leaf. Now that there are tables this will be a great little place to bring friends and family. James also said he is fine with BYOB and currently does not charge a corkage fee, which will be super convenient since there is a great beer spot right next door with 6 packs to go!",

One to wait on us and one to cook.  The server was new - very friendly, but not all that in touch with the menu.   She did her best though and suggested a few dishes that did please our group.     The food had a lot of potential.  Most of us really liked our dishes, but there were a few misses too.   I ordered the kimchi pancake.   It could have been good, but it was pretty burnt on one side (they put that side down of course).   The charred taste sort of overwhelmed it.  My bulgogi bento box was good.  Would order that again.    The main miss for my group is that we had a couple dietary restrictions that were mixed up, resulting in a shellfish allergy being served shrimp.   The chef came out to address whether the whole meal was compromised as a result determined that only the shrimp needed replaced.   I'm not 100% sure the diner was altogether comfortable with this, but she rolled on.     Overall, there isn't a lot of ambiance or frills, but I think you can get a good meal here.  I'd probably do takeout next time.",

    "text": "Have you ever had a dining experience that was so satisfying that you want to run into the parking lot and scream, \"Oh my Gawd! You have to try this place!\" I did and I ... did.  After dining at Oya Sushi, not only did I send text pictures of my meal to three people and told two moms at the school pick up, before I left the parking lot, I gleefully approached an older woman going to get her hair cut. \"You have to try Oya Sushi. You have to.\" \"I'm getting my haircut,\" she said. \"I don't like sushi.\" \"A ha!\" I blasted. \"It's more than just sushi.\" And it was. A total culinary experience.  First let me say I am not one for going to those 'dart and go' international cuisine places, which I thought Oya sushi was. And I'm not one to 'dine in' at a place that is a take out joint.  While Oya is small and has only a few tables, there is table service. It's like ... going to your uncle's house for dinner. On my visit there were two employees, both men, both pleasant, and both not only the servers, but the chefs as well. They take pride in what they make and love what they do and that is evident in the taste of the food.  We were given a complimentary bowl of miso soup. If you think all miso is so-so, you need to try this, it was awesome.  My lunch buddy is not a sushi person, but she was excited to see something called a Kimchi Burger. Neither of us knew what it was, so she ordered it anyhow.  She said it melted in her mouth, cooked to perfection, topped with cheese and served with home cut fries. It's a burger with veggie inside.  Because I can live off Ramen, I ordered the Vege Ramen and an order of something I never heard of  Kimchi Jeon.  Holy cow, Maruchen Noodles have lost their place in my heart. This ... was the real deal. The noodles weren't soggy or big and fat like Top Ramen, they were freaking perfect. The broth had just the right amount of heat and the egg on top ....okay, I have to stop. I may have to go again tomorrow.  The Kimchi Jeon is like a pancake with vegetables. It's tender and tasty and the dipping sauce so perfect I could drink it. I brought a few pieces home for my daughter and she said it tasted like a spring roll pancake.  Everything was aesthetically pleasing and the price was $23.00 for everything.  I know this review is long, but I can't say enough about Oya Sushi. My lunch buddy commented that not once did I reach for the salt shaker ... that never happens. Everything was fantastic.  I left happy. My curiosity about Oya was satisfied, my tummy was pleased and my debit card did a happy dance after the bill arrived.",

Portions are large with layer after layer of flavor... a delight to even the most critical palate! Hard to describe but spicy at first bite yet a spicy that isn't uncomfortably lingering...I had the spicy shrimp Dupbap which was layered with deliciousness, a generous portion of large spicy shrimp (12) with an amazing sauce over white rice. My partner had the spicy beef ramen, served in a huge bowl...more than enough for the largest of appetites. Both choices were outstanding. A small appetizer and Miso soup were served as part of the meal....again they were all bursting with flavor...their Kimchi is outstanding! Our server was well versed on the menu and explained it to us in detail...she was attentive and gave us plenty of time to make our choices as the menu was unfamiliar to us. The owner visited our table twice to make sure everything was satisfactory as well. A definite must if you want the BEST Korean food in the Burgh!",

    "text": "By chance I found out about Oya Sushi from a Yelp message. If there's one thing the South Hills needs, it's a good place to get some Korean food. I live a few minutes away from Oya Sushi, so my daughter and I were excited to try it out after a long day running errands.  We got in around 5 on a Saturday evening, and decided to sit and order something to eat.   Of course we start with the Kimchi jeon, which was really good taste wise, I was just disappointed with the size, being just a bit larger than a regular breakfast pancake. The dipping sauce seemed to just be a side of soy sauce.  My daughter ordered the daegi bulgogi bento (pork), and I opted for the bibimbap. The bento box set up is nicely presented, but it was underwhelming to me because so much of the additions seemed pre-fab, or just box fillers. Daughter said the pork was perfectly seasoned, and spicy enough for her. Most of the accompaniments in the bento box, she preferred I eat them, gee thanks! It seems the offerings are rotated depending on the dish you order. There was rolled Korean omelette, mixed greens salad with a ginger type dressing, fried tempura shrimp, kimchi, and Korean braised potato.   The bibimbap I had was tasty after I added all the gochujang (red pepper paste sauce) I could to it. The variety of vegetables were all legitimate Korean style, soy bean sprouts, spinach, cucumber, and fried egg. The bulgogi style seasoned ground beef, irked me, because it took the authenticity down a notch.   The service was friendly, the miso soup not quite hot enough temperature wise, and the food overall was satisfying. It's a great change when I don't want to cook at home, so I'm pleased to see Oya not far from home.",

Attentive wait staff, good selection on the menu. The gyoza were nice and crispy, delicious pork filling, fresh. The dolsot bibimbap was perfect- the rice got nice and crispy and the bowl cooked the egg. Kimchi jigae took me right back to my local kimbap joint in Busan- bubbling hot, served with rice, spicy and savory. After we'd finished our meal and paid, the lovely Korean lady brought us some haemool patron (seafood pancake), offering it for us to try, and asking that they were adding it to the menu. Warm, crunchy, savory- just everything it should have been. We agreed that we can't wait to go back to try more of their selections.",

I have ordered takeout from here a couple times and I will say I'm a fan! I was nervous to try it at first after driving past its small, slightly hole-in-the-wall appearing storefront, but I've enjoyed everything I've ordered so far!   Each time, my husband and I have ordered one the bento boxes and we've tried the chicken katsu, sushi bento box, spicy pork, and Korean pancakes. Everything has tasted fresh and beautifully prepared. However, one thing that prevents us from ordering from here more often is how long an order takes. I suppose I can't complain about this because you can tell they place a lot of time in preparing quality food, but when we're hungry, we kind of want our food fast. You know what I'm saying? Other than that, the food is very good and I definitely recommend it!",

There was no one in the restaurant so the service was quick. I got the bibimbap, bugolgi bento, salmon roll and tuna roll. While waiting, I went next door to grab a beer and sit outside. Definitely recommend it if it's nice outside and you're doing take out! The food came out promptly and it was well packaged.   The sushi rolls were pretty good and I enjoyed the avocado in them. However, the bibimbap came with ground beef which in my experience with Korean food, it's always been sliced beef. There was barely any meat but it was filled with rice. The same thing with bugolgi, it was ground beef which was unusual. The price of the sushi rolls were fair but not for the bibimbap which I thought was pricey for the amount of meat.",

Our server (and I think owner) was very polite and was worked his butt off the whole! He appeared to enjoy every minute and greeted everyone with a smile. Service was a little slow only because the owner was doing everything from taking orders to answering the phone and cleaning tables. He even helped in the kitchen. I actually liked the pace though because I didn't feel rushed or bothered like I do sometimes at other restaurants. Our meal was very relaxed and enjoyable.   The restaurant is small inside with only 4-5 tables and a few seats at the sushi counter. Prices were very reasonable with 2 of us eating dinner for only $25. BYOB with no cork fee! Beat that! The restaurant and bathroom was very clean. Takeout is also available.   The miso soup was flavorful and did not disappoint. While I like my bibimbap and would get it again, I missed the crispiness of the rice which I thought was supposed to be classic of a bibimbap. My husband loved the spicy sauce that came with the bibimbap. Regardless, I liked it and would have it again. Some of the sushi looked amazing and I can't wait to try that next!   I hope Oya sushi does well and I plan to come back!",

We have never had True Korean before. She explained the menu to us. We also inquired about the bar BQ. She said it's for 3-4 people because it comes with 2 pounds of meat along with sides. We will have to come back with friends to try that. The electric cooktop is right on the table for 4 people. Mrs. Kim, the owner, came out to ask us if it was good. That's a very nice touch. I also got a sushi roll to go. We took a bottle of white wine with us too. What a great lunch on a day in March when it reached 75. What more could a person ask? I would recommend Oya if you want to try True Korean food.",

Oya, which just opened last week, is owned  by husband and wife, James and Kim.  Born in Korea, they have a True passion and commitment to making delicious, fresh food, and excellent customer service.  They make the Miso soup, fresh daily, using James' mother's recipe. The sushi, also, is made fresh daily. I enjoyed a lfragrant, flavorful bowl of vegetable miso soup, and a bowl of ramen noodles, to start. They were both well-balanced, in a rich, tasty broth.  I ordered the salmon an avocado sushi, the best I 've had in well, probably ever.   The dining room is spacious, and classically minimalist in decor, especially furniture. They are eagerly awaiting their dining tables and chairs to be delivered, but until then, dine at the beautiful granite counter on nicely padded chairs. This also gives you the opportunity to talk with Kim and James, if you wish. They are very gracious hosts, and intwresting people.   I plan on a return tonight for dinner, and many more in the future.",

The restaurant itself is nothing fancy, but I promise that you won't be disappointed with the menu selection and the freshness of their food.  There is one woman who cooks the food, and prepares the sushi. She is extremely kind, and I'm assuming she is the owner. I give her major props for being able to run a business and prepare all of the food!  This restaurant is BYOB, which always is a +1 star in my book.  The sushi was so fresh, some of the best that I've had in the south hills.  In addition, we left totally stuffed! The portions were giant, and the flavor was unreal. There are even korean bbq tables - you can order meat for your table (2 lb minimum)  I can't recommend this place enough!",

There was no one else there, which I normally enjoy but it made me feel a little awkward. This place is veryyyyy small, and by the time I was done at 650, it was full. Seats are too high for table and uncomfortable. The BBQ was great. We let the pork belly get crispy like bacon & it was delicious. The bulgogi was super tender and had good flavor. It is more expensive than I was expecting. If you are planning to do BBQ, there is a 2 lb order minimum, and it is $25+ per lb. Each lb is served with white rice, miso, lettuce wraps, veggies, sauces, and other small accents like Kimchi.  Would go back.",

Servings were plenty and we had breakfast for the next day.  Only disappointment was not having the seafood pancake on menu.   I guess I'll be staying with my Shadyside go to for that.

Our waitress Brenna did an excellent job describing the menu to us and process of how the dining experience works.   The restaurant was full when we arrived but luckily they accepted a reservation request a half hour in advance. About half of the seating is regular booths/tables and the other half is authentic grill-top tables you won't find anywhere else around Pittsburgh. While seating is limited, they explained to us they were planning on expanding the restaurant to the adjacent building.   The menu has a variety of Japanese and Korean options but we opted for an appetizer and few pounds of pork and beef BBQ. Everything from the appetizer to the soup and salads to the fresh cooked meats was wonderful. The food came out quick so we weren't overrun with plates all over the table. The experience of cooking your meats and veggies right in the middle of your table is fun. Of course, cooking your own food isn't the only option, they have plenty of prepared dishes as well. Besides the great food and service, Oya is BYOB without an additional charge!  The owners are extremely kind and helpful around the store. This place is definitely a hidden gem in southern Pittsburgh, check them out soon before it's impossible to get a reservation!",

I have to say that I have always been a huge fan of Asian food and have tried a lot but not much Korean food. This was my first time trying dupbap - I tried the spicy shrimp version and let me just emphasize as much as possible that the flavor in each bite keeps you wanting more, it is an immense burst of flavor. The sauce is incredible. In one of my photos included, my friend had the bulgogi dupbap (sliced beef) which our waitress suggested. I think I found a new favorite dish and restaurant all in one. The decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is pleasant - not too quiet, not noisy. We were given the option of where we wanted to sit. The waitress greeted us almost immediately. We were given small appetizer trays that came with the entree - flavorful seaweed, bean sprouts, egg omelets, and small veggies which was a nice touch. It also came with a small bowl of miso soup without any tofu - but equally delicious broth.  Our waitress was very attentive, polite, and had suggestions. I have included some photos of the menu. I have to say I was overwhelmed with choices - the menu is amazing, and I cannot wait to be back. The service is incomparable and I feel that more people need to discover this restaurant. It is small but it definitely provides with so, so much flavor. I cannot emphasize enough how good the food was and it was brought to us in no more than 10 minutes. I am so glad to have discovered this place the service, food, and atmosphere is unlike any I have been to before. The owner even came to ask us how our food was. I will be back many, many times. They sure know their food and how to run a business.  PS, Like others stated, it is BYOB with no extra fee to bring yours. There is a shop to purchase alcohol conveniently right next door! Can't ask for more!",

    "text": "Here's the scene, you could totally miss this place if driving by at night, and the inside is equally as unsuspecting. Yet, this modest outer appearance almost makes the food that much better. The food stands the test against some of the best Korean food I've had in the Pittsburgh area.   This was my second time in, and while I had a neutral experience the first time, they recently revamped the menu and definitely upped their game. Beyond the food, the sauces and sides were stars in themselves. The sauce with my dolsot transformed the plate and the side of spicy pickles was a highlight as well. The bulgogi on top of the dolsot was so flavorful and well cooked. However, certain aspects like the potato pancakes and miso soup could be improved.  Another cool aspect which we didn't utilize was the ability to cook your own meat on the table, I'm not sure of any other place in PGH at this point that has that option. BYOB adds to the appeal and character of the place. My only complaint, as someone who is very big on atmosphere, is that the fluorescent lights created a bright and harsh light and the music was fairly mellow and quiet. Overall, though, a great option for Asian food in the South Hills.",

It's really small and doesn't take reservations, but if it's full you can put your name in at the hostess stand and then pop over and have a beer at the beer store next door.  The hostess called us when the table was ready.  Oya Sushi is BYOB without any bottle fees, so you can also grab a 6 pack to bring with you too.  This place has some tables where you can cook your own Korean barbecue and some regular tables.  We sat at a normal table, so I'm not exactly sure how the \"cook your own\" food works, but it looked like a lot of fun.  We ordered the bulgogi dupbap and some sushi to share.  Everything was so good and seemed authentic.  The staff here was super nice and helpful with recommendations on what to order.  I can't wait to go back and try more from Oya Sushi and Korean Grill!",

Coming from Houston, TX, there is a plethora of amazing Asian food so we were quite skeptical of coming to eat here. Luckily to our surprise, the restaurant wasn't bad at all! The shrimp tempura was my dad's favorite as it was super crispy! I liked their kalbi ramen as the meat was super flavorful, and my sister liked their bibimbap. Other notable mentions include their bento boxes as they are big portions for the money. We didn't get to try their Korean bbq that you can cook yourself at the table, or any of their sushi as we were already too full to order anything else. But overall we really enjoyed this restaurant in Pittsburgh, especially since there aren't many Asian options in the first place.",

However, I am reserving a 5 star till consistency improves. I have been here and had a five star experience and I have been here and had a three. It's never awful, but it's not always amazing. I understand places have bad days and that's fine, but I think for such a small venue it should be easy to be consistent. If I could give 3.5 I would. I would encourage anyone reading this to go and check it out for yourself. It is a great restaurant to have in the South Hills and I am always a huge supporter of Korean cooking. Everything is fresh, well prepared and flavorful. I would encourage more adventurous menu items. There are traditional dishes, but I'd love to see them go deeper into the recipe archives. Korean cooking is so vast that I'd like to see someplace in Pittsburgh with more than just BBQ and jjigae's.",
