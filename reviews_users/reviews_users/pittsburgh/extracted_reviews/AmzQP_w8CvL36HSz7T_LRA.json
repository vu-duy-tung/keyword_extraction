The peanut sauce added just the right amount of sweetness. I had the shrimp Pad Tai. The food itself tasted good with a tiny bit of heat. There was a little to much parsley for decoration on my plate. It was sad to see only 3 other customers dinning in, but their phone did seem to be blowing up with to go orders. I think they need 2 people on the floor vs just one. I also think the peeling paint on the outside and the sad little table cloth on the front porch tables being changed would help spruce the place up a ton!",

Second mistake was getting excited over the \"authentic Thai food\". Not. The restaurant was empty when the eight of us arrived. Empty. We were the only table. Still, there was a hubbub about where we'd sit, with the shadow waitress annoyed that we wanted to sit in an alcove because it would be quieter. \"But that's a table for ten\" she protested. Yes, we would make it up with the tip, we promised. She made no bones about how disgruntled she was, though. A few points. If you have a brand new waiter with someone shadowing him to make sure he gets it right, the shadow should speak up now and then. Like when the brand new waiter has never heard of \"club  Also, train your waiters to WAIT. If someone is in the middle of a sentence, it's really irritating to have the wait person interrupt, not just once, but constantly. Even asking \"Is everything all right here?\" could have waited 30 seconds until the person speaking had finished their sentence. If you're going to serve dirty utensils, and a customer points it out and asks for replacements, apologize. And since they're all wrapped in a napkin together, take back all those utensils, not just the errant spoon. And for Pete's sake, teach your waiter the terms! Our waiter had never heard of nuoc cham. He wasn't sure what fish sauce was. Thai chili peppers were beyond his ken.  We really had been looking forward to this. Really disappointing.",

Stopped in to Angkor and found a group of about 24 in a long table down the middle of the restaurant doing the same.    Our group split a couple of apps.  The Crispy Tofu Triangles that comes with a gingery soy sauce and grilled chicken skewer.  Both good but enjoyed the flavorful chicken more.   For the main course I had the Green Curry Noodles; nicely seasoned and spiced.   Plenty to take home for another meal.   Was able to taste some of the BAn Chhev; very good.    Service was good.   BYOB.  If you forget there is a State Store in the same little strip mall.",

I was all hammed out and yearning for something different; something from a differed place and perhaps time.  I wanted noodles, I wanted chicken, and oh yes, peanut sauce.... It had to be Pad Thai.  Nothing else would do.  I'd only been back in Pittsburgh for about a month, following a seven year stint in Dayton, Ohio.  Not knowing where go, I did what all lost and hungry people should do.  I turned to my fellow Yelpers for help.    Thank God, they did not disappoint.  They guided me towards Angkor, which is only a half mile from my apartment.  Being Wednesday it wasn't busy but it was everything I was looking for.  The decor was really nice.  The service was really good, and fast.  But most importantly, my to-go carton was filled with yummies straight from heaven.  The noodles were piping hot, the chicken was grilled to perfection, and the peanut sauce was all I could have asked for.  I knew from the moment they asked me what spice level I wanted that I had been delivered to a place that was going to make me happy man.  Thank you fellow Yelpers... and Angkor... I'll be back.  Oh yes, I WILL be back, with friends.",

With a fairly diverse Thai/Chinese/Cambodian menu and daily specials that hit the spot, there's a lot to choose from.  I recommend the green curry!  Their masaman curry and pad thai aren't too shabby either.  And, if they ever have a salmon special, get it!  Their spring rolls are ok; I've had better.  But, the tom yum soup is fab!

No, I don't recall the issue number.   At Angkor, you get 5 to an order of this appetizing appetizer. The diminutive discs come with a medley of wonderfully sweet pickled onions and a cucumber sauce. The filler is minimal; the flavor is anything but.   Kay had the Ban Chhev (a large yellow crepe that looked like an omelete) for dinner (please write a review, baby doll).  I had the Shrimp Penang and found it to be favorably reminiscent of the Duck Curry I had at Silk Elephant (I'm assuming them to be the same dish aside from the choice of meat). A roll call of ingredients from the menu is in order: Thai basil, peas, green peppers, red peppers, dried red chili, lemon grass, shallots, garlic, galanga, kaffir lime leaves, and coconut milk. All of the components added up to the sum of their parts, making for a remarkably rich yet racy recipe of rapturous proportions that I barely finished.   Chalk it up to losing my sanity, but I detected a slight licorice flavor. As for the shrimp, they were plump and plentiful in number, but the Penang was so good, I might have been able to eat it sans any meat at all.   Angkor's extensive dessert menu sounded as intriguing as the tracklisting for an upcoming studio album from your all-time favorite band. Some of the names included Golden Threads, Jack Fruit Seeds, Golden Balls (don't. go. there...), Sang Khaya Khatt, Rainbow Cake, Banana Steamed Cake, Squash Custard, Black Sweet Rice, and Avocado Ice Cream.   Alas, Treats & Sweets nearby was calling us for a return visit, so partake we did not, but we will definitely return, if for no other reason than to see what Black Sweet Rice is all about.   P.S. I can honestly tell you that we had no problems whatsoever with the service at Angkor, something that reviewers here on Yelp and elsewhere allegedly had issues with.",

They have Cambodian dishes I've not seen before, and are faithfully spiced as opposed to suburbanite mild.  Everything is available in a tofu or vegetable option, and the sauces aren't greasy or loaded with MSG and thickener.   I highly recommend the garlicky eggplant or the tofu and chive flowers.  Their fresh spring rolls (elsewhere called summer rolls) are delicious and full of fresh basil.  Best of all, the owners sit in the dining area and make sure the customers are happy.

The restaurant is a nice size with very friendly service.  Wish I could give half stars bc I liked the restaurant.  3.5 stars is more appropriate.  The food was nice.  I ordered the Pad Thai.  The order was a nice size.  The sauce was a little sweeter than I would have liked but had nice flavor.  I got a heat level 7 and it had a nice spice.  I could have got a 9 and still been comfortable.  My husband got a Penang chicken curry.  He also got a 7 and enjoyed the spice.  The curry was nice and a good serving amount. My husband also got the fried spring rolls which he said were fine.  Our bill was 25$...cheapest dinner date we have had in a while.   I would go back to try some other things from the menu.",

Vegetables were perfectly cooked - not soggy like I've had elsewhere. Coconut lemongrass soup was fantastic, spicy and delicious. Green papaya salad my favorite I've had since I studied abroad in Thailand. Closest to authentic Thai I've experienced and I will definitely keep coming back for more.",

When I got there to pick up the order, there were about 6 tables with an additional 3 walking in after I did. There was only 1 waitress taking care of the WHOLE place. In addition to her normal duties, she took phone orders, cashed out everybody including take out orders, cleaned her tables and sat new customers! I can see the aggravation on people's faces sitting there waiting for their turn. The food however was amazing. At least the ones we ordered were. There were some great flavors that were also rich. That is why I am torn about this place. I hope the cooking remains the same but management needs to act on service and hiring extra help. Great cooking without fast and courteous service is not enough to keep a place going these days so I hope they spend some money on improving that part of the business.  We will definitely try it again but only to order out and never to dine in until noticeable improvements are made on the dining in part.",

    "text": "So as I mentioned before Thai is my most favorite cuisine but I have never tried Cambodian food before. So we are here in Pittsburgh meeting up my inlaws and they have never tried Thai/ also was very skeptic about trying as they think it'd be too spicy. But I managed to get them to try this with me and it was not as good as we expected it to be.  With exception of the Pannan beef curry the rest of the food was overly sweet and covered in excessive amount of generic tasting sauces. Coming from NYC I have tasted many different restaurants (Thai). And this food is not very good in comparison.  Many of the dishes tasted more like Panda Express Lol. (Japanese eggplant, sweet and sour chicken) the fried rice was decent and he steamed fish was okay but lacked depth of flavor and spice.   The service was excellent and on point. Our sever was the only one working there it seemed and the place got quite a few tables at once but she handled it rather well.   Recommendations:  The appetizers were good, we tried 4 and 2 of them were outstanding, try the na tang (it was rice crisp with an amazing dip) and shrimp blanket is amazing, the beef and chicken skewers were okay.  On the antree I tried their Cambodian fried rice with crab chicken and it was pretty good also recommend you guys pannan curries.   I think this restaurant is suffering from an identity crisis . They should just stick to their Cambodian/Thai cuisine and get rid of their Japanese and Chinese platters. Adding all those affects your chef as well as your food.",

The four fresh spring rolls are healthy with a good balance of mint and basil.  The lemon grass soup was tasty and a '5' hotness so I ordered the same for my meal. The Khmer dish (posted pic) was as hot as I'd like as spices stayed in my mouth.  All vegetables were cooked well and the flavor subtle.  Very nice carrot \"flower \" garnish. My waiter was willing to get me another dish if the selected one wasn't to my liking- how many places can say that?  Glass glasses, matching plateware, clean.  A good value - I spent $23 (w/o tip) for this large dinner and I was full.  Several folks talked with owner and are regulars here...",

We stopped here on a somewhat disastrous trip and this is probably the first place we've been in Pittsburgh so far where I've actually felt like I'm on vacation. Just entering, the decor was lovely and the music was soothing and not too loud (which worked well for me, as I was recovering from a migraine.) The AC was a little cold for my tastes, so you may want to bring sleeves if you're visiting in the summer and get cold easily, but it wasn't absurdly cold.  The service was friendly and attentive, and the menu was packed with vegetarian options. (I did ask and was told the red and green curries did NOT have fish sauce, but do be warned that they are SPICY.) The portions were HUGE (more than either of us could finish in a sitting), reasonably priced and delicious (I had the vegetable skewer and the red curry with tofu, and my mom had the butternut squash coconut soup and the crepe thing.) Definitely recommended for vegetarians/vegans in or visiting Pittsburgh.",

We stopped in for lunch on a hazy, warm Thursday afternoon, being the only ones in the restaurant until another diner walked in for his first time lunch too. The waiter was friendly, and upbeat, didn't mention his name, but was helpful when the other diner had questions about the menu.       For an appetizer, we ordered the deep fried tofu triangles, which my daughter really liked. I'm a tofu fan, but couldn't get passed the fried, oil heavy bites of tofu. Bland, and heavy with oil, it just didn't work for me.       I decided on the drunken noodles, with lemongrass soup, while my daughter opted for Pad Thai and the wonton soup, both which came with a fried spring roll. The presentation of the decor, and the dishes of food were both appealing to the eyes. The lemongrass soup was  tasty, fresh mushrooms and tomatoes in a beefy broth that was not sugary sweet, but sweet and sour at the same time. The fried spring roll seemed to be mass produced which I didn't mind, it was nicely fried, and tasted good. The drunken noodles was full of vegetables, bean sprouts, celery and the like. It was a bit salty for my taste, but good. My daughter enjoyed her food, which for a first trip to a new restaurant was played safe.  For almost $28.00 at lunch, we weren't disappointed, but not blown away either. We might plan another trip to Angkor to try something else, just not rushing to get there right now.",

Walking in, there was only one other party present at 7pm (a little concerning).  This place screams American Chinese restaurant with a little extra polished charm.  The staff were great.  We were greeted an sat immediately (then again, almost noone else was there), and we were offered some suggestions on what to order.  Decided to start with the spring rolls.  The rice paper could have been prepped a little better (a bit chewy), but overall, they were pleasing (crisp, fresh and minty).  We decided to go with the Cambodian Short Ribs (C16) and they quickly came out.  Slowly stewed short ribs with pineapple, mushrooms, tomatoes and a rich earthy sauce on steamed rice.  Definitely stick to your ribs comfort food that reminded me a lot of a cross between Korean short ribs and curry.  My lack of decision ultimately comes from my lack of confidence in the menu as a whole.  While our entree was good, the spring rolls left a decent amount to be desired.  Not sure we'd proactively make the hike out to Carnegie again for this place unless we were already in the area (though then again, the one other table drove the entire way from Greensburg to eat there...  so that's a promising sign).",

I got the green curry and rice which came with a spring roll and soup. For $8. Lemongrass soup was the perfect amount of spicy. I enjoyed the green curry as well. Perfect amount to be satisfied but not too full. I would go here again.",

I ended up trying a Cambodian dish that was not as sweet as the Thai sauces. It was quite good and had extra crunch of water chestnuts. However the taste of the green curry haunted me and I came the next night to experience it completely. Fabulous! I ordered at hotness 3 of 10. Left me with a happy comfortable burn. Just what you would hope for.  Oh the price is very reasonable. Great meal for a Hamilton!",

    "text": "Not en-Thai-rely impressed!  When I saw the signs, and later the reviews, I truly believed that this was going to be THE zenith of Cambodian and Thai foods.  Instead, sadly, I met with great disappointment.  The first red flag, or ominous warning, was when I arrived at eleven this morning and they were not open.  The place was deserted, and when I called and asked if they were going to open, a man said that they will open at eleven thirty.  When I returned at the appointed time, there were already three tables seated, including one with four people.    My second red flag occurred whenever I tried to ask the server about a particular dish.  It contained Phnom Penh sauce And I was unfamiliar...so was he!  He claimed to have just started the prior week.  When, after other questions were posed that he could, it wouldn't, answer, he dashed off to a table of older folks who had numerous special requests and did not return to me for another ten minutes.  When he begrudgingly returned, he took my order of the Pad Ke Mao, or drunken noodles.    It took nearly a half hour to get my takeout.  Rather than a \"sorry about the wait\" or any civilities, the food was instead thrust into my hands.  He did ask me six times if I paid my bill...I definitely did.  Now, upon entering my car I found only disappointment.  The waiter had sloshed some of whatever that place considers Lemongrass soup through the bag.  The soup was in a tiny container and had exactly three chunks of mushroom and two of tomato, and overall minimal flavor.  I was not thrilled with the Drunken Noodles which were very sweet, mushy, devoid of all the vegetables which were allegedly supposed to be included in it.  Worse, I discovered that though I ordered tofu in it, I was given dry, stringy chicken.  I thought about complaining or asking for my $7.50 back, but I figured it wasn't worth the wait...just like the meal.",

He was very short with us since he was overstressed and in such a hurry to get everyones orders.  They need more staff especially on the weekend.  They were out of a lot of things that I asked for to drink, or eat for dessert.  I still think their food is worth the visit for sure,",

The restaurant rarely gets crowded, so no need for reservations even with big groups (though they may appreciate the heads up in any case). It's BYOB, and there's a liquor store in the same shopping center.  When I still lived in the area I was certainly a regular. The staff has been consistently kind and attentive, and I have never had a bad meal. I don't even think they've ever gotten an order wrong before, and I was going every other Saturday (at least).   My favorite appetizer menu items are the fresh spring rolls (best with shrimp, but can be vegetarian/vegan as well) which have the best peanut sauce I've ever had with these rolls, the crispy/fried vegetable spring rolls (also come with an amazing thin, clear flavorful sauce that is good enough to drink on it's own), and the nai tangs which are puffed rice squares served with one of the most interesting toppings I've ever had (peanut and coconut flavors with pork, and I'm devastated there isn't a vegetarian option for this).  Every single entree is a winner. I love their tofu for the protein option. Even before being vegetarian I opted for it. Perfectly crisp and soaked with flavor.    You MUST get their hot jasmine tea with your meal. They serve it with sugar crystals that are so delicately sweet and perfect for tea (less harsh than granulated sugar).   You won't be disappointed. The price, portions, flavor, environment, and service is all on point.",

We had an early dinner after a long day of driving and ordered the pork meatballs, healthy chicken soup, the Moran Chha Kreung, a salad, and fried bananas for dessert. The portions were generous and the flavor was great. The server was very friendly and we had, at 5pm on a Sunday, a quiet early dinner to ourselves.  I don't have many opportunities to eat Cambodian food, but if you want to try it this is a great place! They also have Thai and Chinese dishes too.",

Our server was friendly and food served fast.  I always get red curry and I wasn't disappointed. It was flavorful and they didn't skimp on the tofu or veggies. I do think it was made with cream and not coconut milk because it was thicker than what I've had at some other Thai places. I may ask to see if they can make it with coconut milk next time. I've also had the green curry with my husband and it is just as good. They didn't ask for a spice level as many places do. I prefer a little spicier so I may ask specifically about this next time. The fried tofu app was also delicious with a soy dipping sauce. Was too full to try any sticky rice but I will next time! I think our bill was about $35 for 2 entrees and an appetizer. I'll be back!",

We always start with the  coconut lemon grass soup with shrimp, which is so flavorful. Other favorite appetizers to get are the crispy tofu, fresh spring rolls, and fish cakes. The crispy tofu are so light and yummy. For our entrees, we usually like to get the green curry with chicken, red curry or panang. The green curry is just perfect with the curry not being to thick or overpowering. The panang was a bit sweeter. The only thing I would say is the chicken is a bit dry. Perfect for take out too. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is craving some thai food!",

Their Pad Thai and Curry are some of the best in the area. I have made it a point to try every Thai place in Pittsburgh and this is one of my top favorites. The picture is of Red Curry with shrimp with spiciness of 8. Just want to say for spicy Thai lovers, like myself, a lot of Thai places seem afraid to spice higher but Angkor is not - their scale is True to 1-10 and stay lower if you cannot handle spice. I am a True 6-7 but 8 was delicious for me. However, I am a big spicy fan. Kudos to Angkor, please keep up the good food and service! Recommend to anyone.",

It's a BYOB so make sure you plan accordingly. It seemed there was only one waiter taking care of all the tables. The poor guy was doing his best but it was a good 15 minutes or so before we even got water and we had to ask for wine glasses despite our bottle just hanging out in the middle of our table in plain sight. The chicken spring rolls to start were okay, their peanut sauce was more of a peanut/soy sauce which wasn't my favorite. The short ribs were fantastic, I'd recommend these. I'm pretty boring so I went with the Chicken Pad Thai which was excellent. They didn't ask for a spice level like most places do (it wasn't too spicy). The flavors were great and it was a decent size. Prices were fair. Overall, the food was very good so if you have the time to spare this place is worth the visit.",

The lemongrass soup was very spicy with chunks of tomato and mushroom.  I was expecting something more mild, like tom yum, but I really enjoyed the soup.  The spring rolls were just big enough for two bites.  I ordered the Moarn Chha Kroeung, a dish of mixed vegetables in a thick yellow lemongrass sauce.  It was delicious and I'm having a hard time thinking of a similar, comparable dish.  My roommate got the Moarn Chha Ktom, which he also liked.  Lunches come with your choice of veggies/tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp and are priced with the veggies being the cheapest and shrimp being the most expensive (at $7.95 - hardly expensive).  Service was just ok - they didn't offer dessert and kind of walked away before we could place drink orders, but our food came out very quickly and water was refilled promptly.  I would definitely return if I'm in this part of town again.  If you go, order one of the Cambodian dishes and try something new.",

I know you label urself cambodian/thai, you defineitly need to remove the thai label off you restaurant name! I have eaten at a bunch of thai places and urs was nowhere near being thai, or shall I say authentic thai. Nice try though! We ordered three dishes and one of three was pretty good (the beef dish) but the two thai dishes were nothing like authentic thai. U had no real peanut sauce and nothing was spicy, or close to being spicy like I had requested. Anyone want authentic thai food done the right way, pay a cheaper price and get more food for ur money, come to california and I'll show u some good food!",

    "text": "Angkor, I want to love you. I really do. You just make it so hard for me, sometimes.   I've been coming to Angkor off an on for several years now. I found them through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>, a service that offers discounted dining certificates for partnered restaurants in the area. The first visit, I only went there because I could use the certificates, but over time I found myself enjoying the place more and more.  There are few restaurants more attractive than Angkor, especially located in a strip mall. When diners walk in, the first thing they probably notice are the carved, gilded walls. It's not a huge dining room, but the tables are spaced apart nicely and the decor is top notch. It's very, very attractive inside. I've been there a dozen times or more now and each time I walk through the door I'm struck by the beauty of the place.  The menu is decent, and the prices are not too extravagant. I think the problem lies in availability and service.   My boyfriend loves their haw mook, a shredded fish steamed with coconut milk and curry in a banana-leaf cup. We used to drive across the city sometimes just so he could have it, and more than once we showed up on a Friday or Saturday evening to find out they weren't serving it that night. I completely understand that weekends are incredibly busy and stressful in the restaurant business, but it's listed on the menu as a regular item. The last time we were there, two or three weeks ago, we were told the haw mook is made in advance and when they run out, it's gone for the night. Wouldn't it make sense to list this on the menu as subject to availability, the way seasonal items are listed as market price on other restaurant menus? A sidebar marking on the menu may be enough of a warning to convince people to call ahead before showing up, instead of assuming it is a constant like we did. After the first two \"sorry, we don't have that tonight,\" replies we finally asked about it and were told about the advance preparation.   We've also gone here with other couples several times, and have been disappointed by the service. I've made reservations (more than once) that were lost, and twice now we've ordered food that's taken upwards of an hour to receive, even when we were one of a handful of groups in the restaurant. If I have to go out for dinner during the weekend, I do so either very early or after a dinner rush, so I'm not making a nuisance of myself or stressing out the servers, and still we've gotten mediocre service at Angkor. Once, over the summer, all of our dishes were served except my boyfriend's, and he had already been turned down over the haw mook. After deciding on something else, his order was apparently lost. We had to eat before him while he waited for his meal to be made, and this was after waiting at least forty minutes (possibly more) for ours. All in all it took over two hours to order, eat and manage to pay our bill.   I love the food at Angkor. I've never been disappointed with anything I've chosen. The tilapia dishes are excellent (when they have them, as they've run completely out of it before, in addition to the premade haw mook), as are all of the noodle and curry options. Unfortunately, sometimes I've had to jump through hoops or exercise extreme patience in order to receive dinner.   We've found several places closer that serve haw mook on a regular basis and have never let us down, so we most likely won't be going out of our way to visit Angkor again. However, if I'm in the area I'll still stop in. The food's worth it, so long as the place isn't busy. If I lived closer to the city, I'd make a habit of coming here on the weekday evenings to avoid any issues, but that's not an option for me now. I'll be reserving Angkor for the occasional in the neighborhood treat from now on.",

The spring rolls were OK, but nothing to rave about.  The ginger dish was the blandest concoction I've ever had in a SE Asian restaurant.  I mean, there wasn't a hint of spice or heat, and there was only the faintest trace of ginger!  I am hesitant to hazard a guess as to how a well reviewed Cambodian/Thai restaurant can serve such bland fare; maybe folks around Pittsburgh don't \"do\" spice.  Maybe my palette has been spoiled in the Bay Area by real Thai cuisine.  Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this place based on the one meal I had there.",

The appetizers and the main dishes came out in a relatively timely manner, however, our water glasses were never refilled and the waitress never returned to ask how the food was or if we needed anything. When it was time to go, we actually flagged down another waiter and he brought us a box and our check. I will definitely not return to the restaurant for a sit down meal, but I would consider calling ahead for takeout.  The food was delicious. I got the fresh spring rolls and the chinese chicken with broccoli in a brown sauce, while my husband got the wonton soup and the thai ginger chicken with broccoli in a white sauce. I don't have any negative to say about the food, but the poor service definitely tarnished my experience there. It was our first visit, and most likely our last.",

The owner was a cute little lady who told us the history of the restaurant, as well as her own journey to this country.  The food itself was very tasty and the flavors were distinctly different from your typical Chinese, Thai or Asian restaurant, and it really did have a homemade quality to it.  This restaurant lists itself as both Thai and Cambodian, but we ordered dishes that were all more Cambodian.  One thing to note - all of our dishes were somewhat sweet.  If this is something that bothers you, you might want to ask the owner before you order.  I would go back here again.",

I decided to go this weekend with my parents for lunch - their first Thai experience! We were excited.    I called ahead a few days before to double-check the opening times. I was told that it technically opened at 11, but it was safer to come \"on the later side.\"  \"Like 12?\" I asked. \"Yeah, 12 is good.\"   We showed up at 12 on Saturday and the place looked dead. After waiting around for a few minutes, we tried the door, and found it unlocked.  After standing inside for a couple of minutes, one of us ventured back toward the kitchen to call for anyone. Finally a man came out and said \"Oh, I'll be ready to open in about an hour,\" acting totally surprised and offended that we were inside.  Super annoying and frustrating experience. Is this typical for the weekends? I'm not sure, but it has completely soured me on the place.",

First time we ordered Beef Saramann and Thai Fried Rice.  The Saramann was a curry dish and had lots of veggies and a good portion of meat.  The Thai Fried Rice (Chicken) was EXCELLENT.  I know, it's only fried rice, but there is definitely a hierarchical chain of superior taste amongst the Far East fried rice dishes...and this one ranks towards the top.    My second time eating there I ordered a chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Pad Thai and a Chicken Thai Fried Rice.  Needless to say, they botched my order and I got home to open my cartons, after salivating on the 7 min drive home, to the wrong meats for each dish.  I called and they rectified the situation for a future order.  The Pad Thai was decent.  They got the spice right (I asked for 8 out of 10), but the seafood didn't seem that great.  It was average, to be honest.  But once again, the Thai Fried Rice made up for the mediocre noodle dish.    Uh, I lived in NYC and currently here in Pittsburgh for a short hiatus, so for now, Angkor will be my close to home goto Thai Restaurant.",

Found out the hard way when i got my total lol  Second,     Curry was good. could of used more spice. i never got asked upon ordering if they could make it spicy or not. and it did not indicate whether i could or not on the online menu. either way it was good. I got the red curry with beef...very high in meat. Good veggie ratio overral good.  Third,      Got the crispy baby calamari..was not that impressed...kind of too much crisp. Kind of like going to kfc and getting there extra crispy or whatever that is lol. Too much breading, Not enough Cal.  i will say for the price quality of food ratio it was not that bad. i will def order again because i was impressed with the curry, maybe next time it will be in the resteraunt.",

I get either the Japanese eggplant with tofu or Panang curry with tofu. They do their tofu dishes really well. Service here is friendly and efficient. The tofu in the curries/stirfries are done well.",
