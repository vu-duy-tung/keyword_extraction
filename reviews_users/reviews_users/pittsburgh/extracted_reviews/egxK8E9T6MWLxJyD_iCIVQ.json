    "text": "A nice place.  In typical Sewickley style, it's a bit overpriced, but the food was tasty and the service was friendly.  The decor inside is modern and swanky.  My only other reservation about it is that there really wasn't much variation to my dinner.  It was a plate of chicken and veggies with rice.  There were no other elements.  I would have liked an egg roll or something - just something for a little variety.  It felt like a very big plate to plod through with nothing to break it up.  Thankfully, it was a very yummy plate so I soldiered through, and my tummy was happy.    I would definitely like to return to try their mixed drinks - the menu was impressive and intriguing.  A word to the wise - be careful with leftovers.  My box leaked all over the place.",

You'd think that Sewickley restaurants would be among  the best in the area, but NO.  I ordered a chicken curry dish.  Not a hint of curry.  At all.  When I called to explain my criticism they said basically, \"That's the way we make it\".  So they replaced it with General Tso's.  I wasn't expecting much, and I was not disappointed.  Meh.  I think they are afraid to make any real Chinese food for fear that people won't eat it, so they homogenize the taste for the least common denominator.  Will someone PLEASE bring some real Asian food to Sewickley?",

The General Tso's chicken was burnt but again said nothing but I did mention to the waitress (who I'm pretty sure was the boss because the other workers deferred to her) that our chicken in our chicken and vegetables was pink ( I just wanted to know if that was ok), She scooped up the plate without saying a word and brought it back without the chicken. After that we were persona non grata. We had to go to the bar to ask for water and our check. I can't remember when I had worse service anywhere. I typically leave at least a 20% tip but I left 15% and was mad at myself because she didn't deserve that. I wrote that on the back of our check and hoped that the manager would contact me but as I stated I think she was the manager. With all the restaurants to choose from I would never choose that one again.",

I've probably had over half the menu as I've been going there for at least a decade, I have never been disappointed. They deliver too. A little expensive but other than, perfect.

In high school I liked to bring friends to China Palace and they loved it when I did that because it was so great. If you're gluten free like I am, this place is good for that. They can substitute the regular soy sauce with gluten free soy sauce for you in any dish. I just miss being able to have the amazing egg rolls they have here. I recommend those as well as the chicken with Chinese vegetables and the shrimp fried rice!",

I tried their Green Roll with cucumber, avocado, and asparagus and their Shadyside Roll, which was like a Philly Roll.  I liked the Green Roll better because it had the right \"feel\" for sushi; it was crisp and had a nice snap to it.  The cream cheese just threw off the texture of the Shadyside Roll, but it was still good, I'm just not used to cream cheese in my sushi!  I sat at the sushi bar, so I didn't get to experience the tables or the service there, but Lou was attentive and made sure we were taken care of.  It did seem like they were doing a decent business for lunch.  When I worked in Sewickley, a lot of my co-workers would come here.  It's probably for the best that I waited until after I left Sewickley to experience China Palace, otherwise I'd be here every week.",

    "text": "Gee I sure wish Sewickley would get a decently consistent and reliable Asian restaurant. Have been here more times than I can count over the years, and have never been thrilled, but it's the only game in town. Have narrowed the menu down to a few acceptable dishes.  Used to love their Palace Special Wonton soup until I was eating one time without looking and ingested a complete chicken vertebrae column. Enough of that! Chicken with Broccoli is sometimes decent, often not. Kung Pao Chicken (props for offering white meat only) is often good, but as with many of their dishes, they're not careful with ingredient trimming (e.g. garlic stems, chicken cartilage, bamboo shoot bark, bones, etc.). Young Chow Fried rice was great one time, have not had it that way again. Various lo miens are too often way greasy and have unchewable items. Pan fried wontons are a bit doughy but one of the better app options. Think they may have overextended themselves by offering newer Thai dishes - more miss than hit. Have tried all their \"Chef's Specialties\" at one time or another. Orange Chicken has a decent spicy-sweet sauce, but the batter is too thick and it definitely doesn't travel well (read: soggy).   Noticed a sign on the door a few months ago heralding a new chef specializing in spicy recipes, which got me really excited. Have not noticed any changes in the menu or food makeup.  I will give them credit for a comfy atmosphere and excellent service. Just wish the food lived up to it. C'mon Palace, you may have a decent loyal customer base now, but just think of all the people you could gain that travel outside Sewickley for much better fare that used fresh, authentic ingredients with way more creativity and consistency! Since I'm a huge Asian food fan, I for one would become a frequent diner vs once a month!",

First of all no one in the restaurant at 8:00 PM while the restaurant across the street was packed. That should have given me a heads about about the quality of food I was about to receive.It was obviously not freshly made as both the chicken and pork were dry, tough and lukewarm. I will not return.",

They have new menus - maybe that's why they started adding these extra charges.  One dish is enough for two people to share and be full.  Everything we've ordered was delicious.",

Also got one of the rolls (can't remember which one), but it was boring and lacked flavor too.",

And we weren't given any napkins or utensils when we picked it up.   Don't waste your time or money.   Plenty of other Chinese cuisine in the area.   Oh and lastly,  the food was subpar at best.   Everything had that \"freezer to microwave\" Flare to it.   Probably frozen panda Express from giant eagle.",

    "text": "On my most recent visit my boyfriend and I ate dinner here and we shared the shrimp tempura roll and the spicy California roll and both were made perfectly and were delicious.  We also got the chicken egg fu yung and the Tender Blossoms Stir Fry.  I wasn't fond of the egg fu yung but I tend to like my food spicier, however my boyfriend said that he enjoyed it.  It's nice that they also have a full bar and they offer several decent wines by the glass, and their alcohol prices are very reasonable.  I probably go to China Palace in Sewickley about 6 times a year, and overall  I think that they do a really good job at offering a diverse menu filled with traditional Chinese offerings as well as the more standard \"Americanized\" offerings along with a nice selection of Thai food and a great/delicious offering of sushi/sashimi/rolls.  I've honestly never had a bad meal here - so for me, they have always been consistently good and the service continues to impress me - in fact the service has gotten even better in the last couple of years, and the remodeling has given the place a more modern, and expansive feel to it.  The only thing that I will say is that even when you ask for something to be spicy (like 10 out of 10) more likely than not you can expect the spiciness to only be about a 5 so be sure to ask for the hot pepper oil or for some hot sauce on the side.",
