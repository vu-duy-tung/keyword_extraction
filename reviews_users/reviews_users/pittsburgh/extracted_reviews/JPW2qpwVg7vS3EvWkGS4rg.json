Waited forever for our food and then when it finally came my husbands blt was ice cold & had mayo smothered all over it (it was ordered NO MAYO), my avocado toast was ice cold, could not eat it, left it!!  Service was very poor, waitress kept disappearing, had to ask busboy to find her to refill our coffee! WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE EXTRA TIME AND GONE TO THE DOR-STOP IN DORMONT-ALWAYS ENJOY THE FOOD  & SERVICE THERE!!",

    "text": "I have been anxious to try this place for quite some time.  This was the restaurant I chose to celebrate my birthday with friends. I ate light all day so I can eat a nice/big dinner and was very hungry. I read all the reviews on yelp which aided in my decision of what I was going to order off the menu.  I arrive in Carnegie and surprisingly, it didn't take me long to find parking on a Friday around dinner time.   Off street parking is available close by.  I arrived a few minutes early than our reservation time and sat at the bar.  The restaurant is small but quaint, trendy and bright. The service at the bar was very good. I was just about to order a drink when my friends arrived.     Ok, I never mind sitting at bar or counter to eat or drink but tonight was a special occasion.  I was looking forward to sitting at table and spending time with my friends celebrating my bday (why a reservation was made).  When we asked to be seated since we had reservations, a young man brought us back to the counter that overlooks the chefs hard at work.    Any other time this would have been ok - but not for this occasion.  The young man talked to a woman who I assume was a manager and she confirmed that the reservation was NOT updated from 2 - 3. My friend had made the change and did receive the confirmation email but the change never went through?   The woman apologized and said the person who took the reservation didnt update and wasn't there.  She offered us a seat a bar until a table was ready.    I know ok what else could you do when the place was crowded and it was Friday night - dinner time.  This is \"WHY\" reservations are made and puzzled at why it wasn't updated.. it's the whole point to a \"reservation\"?  Maybe a computer glitch too who knows?   At the bar we all ordered drinks.  The service was great.  So by the time I finished my second drink we were seated.   I was so glad because was really looking forward to experiencing \"Bakn\".     We were seated at a table near the front window and our waitress was courteous. This is the type of restaurant where you want to order several entrees with a group and having fun sampling each dish.   For an appetizer we ordered the loaded fries  .. scallions and bacon bit.. they delicious...not over done with ingredients.. they were prepared \"just right\".  I love the sides of bacon flavors on the menu..  I ordered the sriracha ..best bacon I have ever tasted:  crispy and extremely flavorful.   For my main course I ordered the \"Slow Braised Short Ribs\" (creamy parmesan polenta, applewood smoked bakn, scallion, tomato, sunnyside Egg.)   Superb!   The combinations of flavors were excellent. I really loved the parmesan polenta!   I couldn't finish (since ate the fries and side of bacon) and took half home and had it for breakfast the next day.     I think this establishment deserves the hype.   Even though we had a minor reservation issue -we were still seated, received great service and the food was excellent.  The prices are slightly about average but it's worth it.  Thanks Bakn!",

Parking can be an issue, but they are working on it and in the mean time, don't deny yourself this experience. A great community place.  Communal table - wood repurposed from a church in Bloomfield and legs from a bridge abutment. Art by local artist. Replaced the ceiling with acoustic tiles to keep the ambient noise levels down, so you can have a clear conversation at your table. The whole theme based on a little place in New Zealand. Staff is great, owners are real people with a dream and putting in the effort to get it right!",

My husband loves the beermosa and I just tried the Irish coffee yesterday, which was great!  Service has always been on point as well.  And of course the pig-related decor is cute!  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Although I think we finally figured that out by finding a public parking lot not too far down the street.  Can't wait for our next visit!",

Everything was fantastic, especially the home fries. Fiance had the bakn'cake tacos and could only finish 2/3--they were enormous, but he was pleased. They have a full bar, which is nice, and the fresh-squeezed OJ is pretty fantastic. My only complaint was the service was a little sub-par. We came in around noon, and were seated immediately. When we first arrived, it was pretty busy, but seemed to clear out as we waited. It appeared as though some of the waiters and waitresses were also bartending, and it seemed as though the wait staff would ask if you needed something, then go do 5 other things before attending to your request. It was also weird as once they started to slow down, there were quite a few servers just kind of standing around. Food was amazing and worth the slightly inefficient service.",

(Trust me on this one)  Great atmosphere, fabulous decor, pleasant staff and yummy food - I only downgraded a star because coming off of the first two tastes, my entree was a big miss. I envisioned (as described), a *stuffed pepper* of sorts but what you really get is a pile of polenta topped with a roasted pepper, a layer of sausage, a big runny egg and scallion & bacon accents. It didn't taste like anything at all and by the time the egg yolk ran its way around, it was just a mushy mess of yuck and nothing - no distinct flavors or texture.  My hubs got the pancake and I got a bite of that which was delicious so I think if you eat there, just choose to go all in with the bacon (and general breakfast) theme.",

We waited a while to get seated but according to the girls, it was worth the wait. My youngest only wanted a bacon sandwich...I got her what I had last time which was the BLT...this time without the L and T.  My oldest got what looked to be a breakfast flat bread...looked like a breakfast pizza...it too looked great!!!   She enjoyed it and even took some home...I had the breakfast tacos...these were AMAZING!!  three pancakes shaped like taco shells, egg, bacon, arugula, cheese and a side of syrup...they were delicious We also got a couple sides of bacon...because, like me, they love their bacon.  It was a mix of the way we all like it...mostly crispy (perfection) and breakfasty with a chewiness to it (my youngest likes that).  The girls loved it and of course, it's the important thing.  When asked if they wanted to come back to Bakn, it was a resounding, YES!!!",

    "text": "I *LOVED* this place. On a rainy Saturday morning, we were out in Mt. Lebanon anyway -- so not far -- and my kids and I decided to check Bakn out. HOLY hannah.  Right off the bat, we lucked out, as there were seats at the kitchen counter, so we didn't have to wait at all for a table. SCORE! This was an extra bonus, because we got to watch the kitchen crew in action (more than a little impressive).  Because reasons (read: I needed no reason), I got their signature bloody mary, which was SOLID awesome. It had the perfect balance of horseradish and zing -- not too spicy, but not at all bland. And it was garnished with a big ol' honkin' piece of black pepper-encrusted bacon. How could that be bad?!   One of my kids, based on Yelp reviews, got the shrimp & grits and, on her first bite, her eyes rolled back into her head. In short, she was in Heaven. The other kid got bacon (bakn)-stuffed pancakes. He was more than a little impressed with the stack of dinner plate-sized cakes, fluffy and golden, that were, as advertised, STUFFED with bacon. I opted for the porkbelly Cuban sandwich, which was to DIE for good. The accompanying slaw was OK (too mayonnaisey for me), but the sandwich was so good that the side could have been just about anything and I wouldn't have cared.  Top the great food off with a great atmosphere and staff that was bend-over-backward helpful and fun, and Bakn is a recipe for a GREAT meal. We will most definitely be back!",

    "text": "Great Gastropub in Carnegie. Starting off with an appetizer of Candied Bacon, which was 3 strips of bacon, covered with a sweet syrup, its bacon, it was good!!!  I had the Bakn Blue Burger, which is a half pound burger, topped with Peppered Bacon, Jarlsburg cheese, creamy blue cheese, blue cheese crumbles, a red onion marmalade, Arugula, which i leave off. Great burger, loved it, cooked how i wanted it. A side of seasoned fries, which were really good. My gf got the Berry pancakes, with a side of, of course, bacon. 3 big fluffy pancakes, which by themselves are just ok. BUT, stuffed with blueberries, and topped off with Blueberry syrup topping, side of whipped cream, and fresh fruit, now you have a winner!!! Great first time, looking forward to going back. Friendly wait staff!! Two thumbs up!!",

The server dropped one of our party's dishes on the floor by my feet (hey, accidents happen and at least it didn't get all over me) but it meant that one person at our table was left without a meal while they re-fired it (and then he tasted what another diner at our table had ordered, was unimpressed, and changed his order, which they handled graciously). My shortribs and polenta were really off. The server recognized after she served them to me that she shouldn't have brought them to the table and she offered to re-fire them (the polenta was literally the texture of cornmeal broth and the small narrow spoon they offered me gave me no way to eat it). So then two of the three of us at the table had no food and the one with the food felt rude eating so she ended up with a cold meal by the time we were all served. The staff was extremely gracious and they took 10% off our bill for the trouble (eh, not much but they really did correct every misstep). My re-fired shortribs were ok - a little tough, and the polenta was underseasoned. Everyone else thought their food was pretty good. I think I will give it another try because the intentions were all very, very good.",

This was the nicest restaurant still open in the area near the hotel and boy am I glad that was the case.  The atmosphere is great - small, but still very open feeling with tall ceilings and an industrial feel.  The wait staff was nice and our food came out quickly.  The food was phenomenal!!!  We got bakn slammed honey with biscuits to start and I think I could have just eaten this all night - so delicious.  My husband got the grilled cheese with fries - the fries were well seasoned and the grilled cheese was tasty.  I got the panzella salad with salmon which was very flavorful (the salmon was extra good with a little more of the bakn slammed honey spread on it, couldn't let it go to waste!).  If we lived here, I would DEFINITELY be going back.  Yum.",

I asked if I could have a fruit instead of fries and toast and the nice waitress said sure.  I received the eggs and bacon which were great and a small bowl of strawberries and blueberries which were also tasty....so why the 3 stars?.... I got my check for the $8 breakfast but was charged $5 for fruit.   I never would spend $5 on fruit and was blindsided.  Moral is ask if there is an up charge.   I didn't complain to them because it was crowded and probably should have but $5 for fruit is Crazy",

Didn't really seem very team oriented.  Gotta help each other in a busy restaurant.  Like I said, the food was fine. I had a chicken sandwich, with bacon, and it was ok. I would also expect since this had bacon on it that given the name of the restaurant that it would be great.  The bacon was average as well.

This place is small which means it's easy to see who is eating, who has finished and, who just sat down. We arrived at 10am and there was a table of 4, same as us, who just finished eating near the back of the restaurant. When we finally got seated at 10:25 near their table they were still sitting at the table talking. Not eating, not paying their bill and not getting helped by anyone working there. Just talking. You cannot have people waiting for a table and allow customers to sit there and chat, you have to kindly ask them to leave so you can serve other people. We sat at the kitchen bar and got to see at the action. It was fun! Even had a chat with the expeditor who was very friendly...and BUSY! When we got our bill we noticed that the military discount dropped from 15% to 10%. Not sure why, but wanted to point that out to those who are interested.",

This was a great environment, the workers made you feel at home. They had a good selection of music playing to keep you entertained while you wait. I ordered the breakfast tacos. ($16.00) It was amazing ! Minus the sunny side up egg (I'm not a big fan of those).   Con: the meals took a little longer to cook than I would have liked. But it wasn't unbearable. Parking was extra sucky! They are a tad bit too pricey.   But overall I liked this place.",

I've been in the service industry for 15+ years and when the owner/ executive chef is tending to the host stand checking in guests, at the kitchen doing expo and walking thru the dining room shows a passion and care. And it shows. We were seated by the door and I had relatives visiting from out of town so  the door opening and closing became a bit chilly, the owner moved us right away without hesitation.

    "text": "I finally came here after months of it being on my bookmarks. On entering it was early but a slow day maybe two tables inside and two servers. We weren't greeted on entering even with a girl at the bar when walking in. After being seated we looked over the menu and honestly off the back I was disappointed with a lot of the options on the menu. Nothing here is really a True complete dish where's a platter with French toast eggs bacon home fries and so on? If you come here plan on spending a lot because everything has to be added on to the main dish. Another thing that was disappointing was they have a pancake dish with chicken well where's the waffles and chicken classic for those who don't eat pancakes? Anyways I settled for the almond crusted French toast and got the two links of spicy sausage. The French toast came out hardly warm to where the butter would not melt. The sausage was also disappointing because I asked for \"spicy\" and it barely had any kick to it it felt like the normal and spicy got mixed up. My two guest didn't seem to pleased by there meal as well. The food took forever to come out maybe 40 minuets now I understand it's not fast food but for two other tables to be eatting and be that slow it shouldn't take that long. I recommend this place for us to try and it was a big let down the bill came to almost $55 for 3 people with drinks and food and we still left hungry. I'm so disappointed in this because I was so stoked about coming. I doubt I'll ever be returning here again in the future.",

    "text": "For someone that isn't fond of actual bacon, I had a delightful time at Bakn this past weekend! My boyfriend, Darius, and I were in search of a good brunch place that served Bloody Marys, and this spot satisfied all that we were looking for and then some. We grabbed a seat at the bar as soon as we arrived to avoid a wait for a table, and we were on our way to bacon paradise.  There's something refreshingly pleasurable about a Bloody Mary that has the right amount of horseradish and seasonings in it, and the signature Bakn Bloody Mary was alright in my book. It had a piece of peppered bacon in it, a pickle, and some bacon infused vodka. I couldn't really taste the bacon infusion, but nevertheless my craving was satisfied.   On to our meal. Breakfast and brunch are two of my favorite things, but brunch is always a tough choice. Sweet or salty is the decision that will plague me for a lifetime, and items that are both sweet AND salty make my life way easier. The day I went to Bakn I was in a salty mood, so I decided on one of the 2 breakfast sandwiches on the menu. Pictures from Yelp affected this choice if I'm being honest here. The #1 breakfast sandwich looked way too good to pass up. It came on sourdough with bacon mayo, a lot of melty Jarlsberg cheese, arugula, egg, and bacon. I got my bacon on the side and my boyfriend ate it at the speed of light. The other choice of the 2 breakfast sandwiches was a salmon sandwich, which sounded equally great but I just wasn't in a fishy kind of mood at the time. The one I got was fairly priced at $10, and it came with a big portion of home fries that allowed me to take home half of my sandwich, too.   Darius got the chicken and cakes, and honestly I was a bit disappointed in the presentation and the price. All the right flavors were there, including the 2 crispy fried chicken strips, the 3 fluffy but thin pancakes, the syrup, and last but not least the mass amount of bacon jammed between each pancake and piled up on top, too. It tasted amazing, but for $16.50 it was underwhelming. If there was another chicken strip and the pancakes were a bit bigger this would be a real winner and I'd order it every time.  Overall I do like this place. It's a neat concept and it's something that I feel like even the most nonchalant diners could get excited about. If you're looking for an outside-the-box brunch spot, head on over to Bakn!",

I came to Bakn fully expecting to eat a BLT, as of course they'd have one (I had never been here despite attempts in the past).  As I sat down at the bar and ordered my beer, I noticed they had a breakfast menu as well and immediately my eyes went to the berry pancakes. I asked the bartender if it is served all day and found out the answer was a resounding 'yes.'  Funny thing is, I'm not a big pancake guy (aside from Pamela's), and usually stick to French toast. These pancakes were absolutely perfect: fluffy, sweet, hot and perfectly cooked. Homemade whipped cream, berry syrup, and pineapple/grapes rounded out the plate. I ordered a side of peppered bacon which was surprisingly the only somewhat disappointment as it was likely reheated and not crispy (but bacon is bacon, good even when simple).  I'm not sure if this is a 5 star restaurant on every occasion (time will tell), but it was last night, and I'll definitely be back.",

The place has a lovely, comfortable interior with artwork done by one of the owners - talk about a personal touch. Unfortunately, I've never made it here for brunch, which is my biggest end-of-year regret right now because their pancakes look AMAZING.  But at least lunch and dinner here have not disappointed me yet. Bakn has some very tasty burgers and sandwiches, as well as a line of grilled cheeses that I really want to try. The most recent example I have is that during a visit I added Bakn jam to my veggie sandwich (you have the option of adding it, avocado or a fried egg to everything). Obviously I don't recommend adding the bacon to my vegetarian diners, but I can confirm to anyone who steps in that meat and vegetables alike are cooked well and topped off with some delightful sauces and toppings. And that bacon jam was sweet and divine and yuuuuuuuummmmm - heads up carnivores, you must try that jam!  So sure, I desperately need to return one day for brunch - how's that for a 2017 resolution - but no matter what time of day you dine here, you really won't be disappointed. Pancakes and grilled cheese and cocktails all await me here in 2017 and I can't wait to try them all at this local favorite!",

We went to lunch and only had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated. I like that they had tables of different sizes and heights. I DIDNT LIKE the fact that they had so many tables packed in the place that you can barely move. It would help if they took out even two tables.  We were seated and felt claustrophobic.  The menu had a lot of choices. There were a couple of items that looked toting but I live breakfast foods so I ordered the Bakn Bakn Bakn omelette. Our server was extremely nice but it took a long time for us to get our food. My omelette had 3 eggs, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Peppered Bacon, Boar Bacon, and mozzarella cheese. It came with toast and thin sliced potatoes. The omelette was not nearly as large as other 3 egg omlettes I have had. With 3 types of bacon I was expecting a lot of bacon.  There was a small sprinkling of bacon on top of the omelette. There was only small bit if bacon in the omelette.  It was in the last third of the omelette.  I was hoping you would be able to taste a difference in the 3 bacons but it all tasted the same. I'm not even sure I got 3 different kinds. On the other hand, there was a lot of mozzarella cheese. The whole thing was just bland.  The potatoes were bland and toast was barely toasted.  My husband ordered the BLT. It was bacon overload. It was very tasty. The coleslaw that came as a side was also delicious.  Since my husband's food was better than mine I am hoping that other things on the menu will be better. I'll be giving Bakn a 2nd chance.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner and they have exactly the same menu all day. Guys... breakfast for dinner. Awesome.  Staff was very friendly! Our waitress specifically cracked jokes with us and had an absolutely bright personality. Everything came out quickly. When one of our orders came out wrong, she apologized and got it fixed right away.  For the food. I got the Bakn Bleu Burger, medium. The burger came exactly as I wanted it, nice and pink in the middle. The meat was juicy, the onion jam was sweet, the bacon was crispy and fatty. Overall, all the flavors complimented each other fantastically. I really liked my burger: it was a great burger for the price. Compared to like-priced burgers (BRGR, Burgatory), I would say that I enjoyed Bakn's burger more.  My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich. It was phenomenal. A nice runny yolk in the inside, fresh arugula, roasted tomatoes, and of course, bacon. Everything worked so well together. I think this is the reason why I will come back. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the home fries, which were a little too greasy.  Among our group of friends, we got the biscuits with bacon-honey jam. The bacon-honey jam was really good. The biscuits were not what I expected: they were crunchy and hard. I was expecting biscuits to peel apart, or at least cut with a knife, which crumbled to parts when we tried. Still, the jam... so good.  Depending on what you get, it can range from a little pricey to reasonably priced. For example, the bacon flight (4 strips of different types of bacon) was worth about the same as a sandwich.  Overall, I will be coming back for brunch.",

Their exhaust fan wasn't working, which meant grease and smoke filled the air (bacon smell isn't necessarily bad, but it soaked through every article of clothing I had on).   Prices are pretty high ($11 cheeseburger, $8 grilled cheese, $12 BLT), both relative to nearby restaurants and also for the quality and quantity of the food.   My bacon cheeseburger was not cooked to order and another plate at the table had the wrong order.   I'm not sure what it'll take to get me to go back but the bacon novelty won't be enough to overcome my first impression.",

The roasted tomato and fresh sourdough bread along with quality bacon made the sandwich better than your average sandwich.  We also tried the bacon pancake and it was amazing, so light and fluffy.    On a previous visit we tried the BLT - excellent and SO, SO full of bacon; the bacon omelette - good but not overly special however the portion is very large and toast is better than your average toast.",

However, I totally picked the wrong things to order. The waitress pointed out two things on the St. Patty's day special menu.  Corn pancakes with blueberry compote and pork belly and the Guiness fries.   I got them both and then were just ok.  Didn't blow me away.  I should have stuck to the traditional menu, especially since it was our first time here.  I will definitely be back to try other things.  Like I said, it was all definitely above average.",

    "text": "Came to Bakn with my son for a Father/Son Brunch.  The location has no parking that I'm aware of, but we were able to find a spot on the street.  We were greeted immediately upon entering, and being we were a party of two, the hostess asked if we would mind sitting at the kitchen bar, which we agreed to.  The high granite counter looks right in at the kitchen.  The high 'bar-style' chairs are uncomfortable.   We sat down and scanned the one sided menu.  After about ten minutes, a waitress came and took our drink order, my son a lemonade ($4!?!? With NO refills?!?), me a water.  When she walked away another waitress came and asked us about drinks.   Our beverages came quickly, and that's where the experience went down hill.  After waiting 25 minutes, I flagged down a bus boy and explained it was our first time there and asked if I needed to go somewhere to order... He asked me to hang on and went towards the wait staff counter.  Five minutes later, one of the waitresses came over and offered a 'I thought she was taking care of you....'  I ordered the #1 breakfast sandwich ($10) and a side of hot sausage ($4).  My son ordered the three bacon pancakes ($10).    Again, the wait.  It was busy, and the kitchen appeared to work efficiently. After about 15 minutes we finally saw my sons pancakes get poured on the grill.  One of the line cooks looked at us and commented that we had been there for a while, and asked what we ordered...  He was the ONLY one that showed any sense of urgency.    My sandwich was served on a metal bowl, with a small Mound of  fresh hash browns.  My side sausage was on a plain saucer sized dish.  My sons pancakes were large, and on a plate with a small amount of fresh fruit, and coated in powdered sugar. 55 minutes from seated to food coming to the table.   I tried the hash browns first.  They were potato slices cut thin.  Some were under done, some dry.  They had A TON of Rosemary on them.  I ate about half and tried the sandwich.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The sourdough bread was fresh and perfectly toasted.  The bacon was complimented by roasted tomatoes, jarslburg cheese and arugula ('It's a veg-e-table.').  I ate a few bites of my sandwich and attempted to break a corner off of the sausage.  I was unable to penetrate it with my fork.  I cut it with the knife and tried a bite.  It wasn't very spicy, but it was VERY dry. Nearly inedible.  I considered sending it back when I saw how they made it... A refrigerated, fully cooked sausage patty was placed on the grill under a metal lid with a squirt of water.  I reluctantly ate it.  I looked at my son- he had cut the corner off of one of the pancakes, and was digging the bacon out of the center of the others.  I asked them how he was enjoying them.  He said they weren't good, and told me to try them.   The pancakes were chalky, tasted like they used too much Bisquick in the batter.  He ate half a pancake.  I really wanted to love Bakn.  I asked a co-worker who frequents the restaurant scene in the area.  She liked the food they got, but said the service was excruciatingly slow for them as well.    Gab n Eat, just a mile up the street remains our favorite breakfast in Carnegie.  Try there first.",

    "text": "We decided to give Bakn a try tonight and we were very disappointed.  The service was poor for what appeared not a very busy night.  For drinks we ordered ice tea which arrived without any sugar or sweetener.  After getting the waitress' attention 10 minutes later we were finally able to drink our beverages.   We ordered the bacon appetizer which was nothing special.  There was Applewood, barbecues, smoked, sweet, and siracha-flavored bacon strips.  None of them were especially tasty and I could do as much in my own kitchen.   I expected more.  After all, this was supposed to be an appetizer.  For our entrees, I ordered the 1-pound BLT with a side of coleslaw.  My wife ordered the Pork Belly Reuben sandwich with fries and we ordered a side of Mac and cheese to share.  When we received our sandwiches, the Mac and cheese was missing.  Okay, no problem, we figured that the server had he hands full and it would be here in a minute.  After a while, still no Mac and Cheese.  We figured that the waitress forgot to put that order in.  So, we get her attention and we're told \"I'll check on it.\"  Several minutes pass then she tells us it will be out in a minute.  Okay, fine but now we're chewing our ice cubes and in spite of coming to our table a few times, the waitress somehow didn't notice we needed a refill nor were we asked how our meals were.  That level of service is highly annoying to me.  I don't often drink alcoholic beverages but maybe the wait staff would have been more attentive had I been.  Anyway, about the food.  We were not impressed.  Our sandwiches were rather bland, as was the Mac and Cheese.  We split our sandwiches so my wife had half of my BLT and I half of her Reuben.  We agreed that they were not seasoned very well.  I found the Pork Belly Reuben to be particularly bad.  The meat was very tough and chewy.  For 2 Iced Teas, the appetizer, our 2 sandwiches and the sides, the bill came to $46 Dollars and change.  A little pricey for the quality of the service and food. I had hoped for more.  I am a big fan of bacon but unfortunately, we won't be going back to Bakn.",

Food on the other hand was outstanding!  Drink wise I got a screwdriver which was made with fresh squeezed OJ and tasted great. My buddies got the signature Bloody Mary's. Looked good also and was told equally great. Big slice of bacon was included with theirs.  For entree I ordered the Banana Fosters French Toast and it didn't not disappoint.  Chocolate sauce was like heaven.  I give it a 5 stars and the only down side I can think for some maybe the pricing but it is not out of the realm for this area. I highly recommend Bakn.",

We were eagerly following the status of open tables on NoWait and were exciting to see that they were listed as come on in.  However whenever we got there we were told that we would have a maximum 45 minute wait.  From what I could tell, the issue with the no wait app was that Bakn had tables for two, so while it would have been a walk in for them, it wasn't for us.  Thankfully we only waited about 5 minutes before we were given the option of splitting a community table.  Without knowing how much longer the wait was going to be we eagerly accepted it.  The inside of bakn looks rather modern and has a well lit bar on one side of the restaurant and a number of tables on the other.  The walls are also decorated with pop art pictures of their logo, a pig.  I thought that a few of them were clever and really enjoyed them.  For dinner my wife and I decided to start off our meal with the biscuits and bakn slapped jam while I also went with a flight of bacon.  Yes you read that right, a flight of bacon.  It consisted of slices of all natural, applewood smoked, Cajun, candied and peppered.  Honestly I have never been able to compare and contrast bacon before and I found it to be rather fun. My favorite of the bunch was the peppered bacon and I also really enjoyed the candied bacon.  The biscuits with bacon slapped jam were also good with the \"jam\" being the best part.  It essentially was spreadable bacon and was amazing.  Then for my entree I ended up having the Reuben.  At Bakn it was made with house prepared pork belly pastrami, apple braised sauerkraut, applewood smoked bacon, swiss cheese and dressing all served on marble rye.  All of the components of the sandwich tasted good together and it definitely resembled a Reuben.  While the meat was also good I didn't really think that it tasted like pastrami so was a bit disappointed in that.  Overall though I ended up enjoying my entree.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed almost everything about bakn including the food and the space.",

I ordered the grilled cheese and it didn't live up to the menu's description of it. Maybe next time, I should try the breakfast food. The menu seemed to jump all of the place from pancakes to dinner entrees. I'd be willing to give it another chance, but I'll skip the blood mary.",

    "text": "Really wanted to love BAKN. Interesting menu and decor attracted us to give it a try. What can I say? It just wasn't a good experience. Meeting friends and decided to start at the bar. The bartender seemed lost as fumbled his way through our drinks, asking me how to make a \"Rusty Nai\"l and guessed wrong on a friend's \"Cosmo\". Adding to commotion, bartender functions as coffee Batista for waiters, another distraction for the inept bartender. By the time our table was ready, we had the \"pleasure\" of observing a manager (owner?) terrorize and humiliate a waitress for what appeared to be a minor mistake (dinner and a show?).   Because of its convenient location and attempt to be something special, our friends agreed to give BAKN another try. Sadly, our 2nd visit was similar to the 1st, it seemed like \"Groundhog Day\". Apparently, management prefers criticizing employees to actual training. Despite the interesting concept, poor management is likely to spell doom for BAKN.",

It is located on Main street in carnegie which has quite a few other great restuarants and businesses popping up. This area has been cleaned up a lot over the years. The food was top notch here though, and we plan on eating here again very soon. The only draw back would be the parking.",

    "text": "Bakn was a toughie. I went in with high expectations - the service was excellent however the food was just ok.  A friend and I arrived around 12:30pm on a Sunday - the wait was 30-40 mins. I was not successful on my phone but I'd suggest putting your names in on NoWait before arriving.  I ordered a drip coffee and breakfast sandwich #1. My friend ordered the fennel salad and a side of the applewood bacon. The coffee was great. The breakfast sandwich was alright - buttered up and rich with cheese, house mayo and bacon. However thought it could use some sort of kick - maybe a sharper or hot peppered cheese? The hash browns were ok - the crispy potato portions were too crispy/hard and overall lacked salt and were oily. My friend enjoyed her salad but she was disappointed with her side of applewood bacon (she almost ordered the bacon flight which in theory sounds amazing) - by the looks of what came to our table I would be sad too. For a place that focuses on bacon we both thought the slabs would be more of a thick cut but what appeared looked like bacon that we had microwaved ourselves - woomp woomp.  That being said I really liked our waitress - Debra! She was awesome - friendly, checked in but not too often, and even after her shift ended she told us she told the staff to check in on us. If you get Debra you will be taken care of. The hostess was also nice too.  I'm glad that Carnegie has a place like Bakn and it is reasonably priced - not including tip my meal was ~$11 and I was still full seven hours after - but I probably wouldn't return unless someone initiated.",

We were a large group but the restaurant was not busy and service could have been better. One waiter or bus-boy simply stood near the back of the room overlooking the dinning area much of the time we were there, seemed a little odd and somewhat uncomfortable actually. Might need to go back and try it again now that we have moved to Carnegie, but I'll not make a special effort to do so.",

However, the food was not quite as consistent. The first time I went, I had a Frittata and Cajun bacon. The frittata was borderline uneatable. Crunchy on the outsides and mushy on the inside, with huge soggy pieces of mushrooms. The Cajun bacon was equally difficult to consume. It had SOOOO much seasoning that it literally hurt my tongue. The wheat bread with my frittata was good so I was able to hide a piece of bacon in there and Was able to salvage some sense of satisfaction.  My second attempt with Bakn, was much more enjoyable. After my first experience, I decided to go with a safer approach and opted for the breakfast sandwich, and it was fantastic. One of the best that I've ever had.  I'll have to give this place a few more tries, but it'll be hard to stray from the breakfast Sammy.",

    "text": "Came last night for a promotional event. The food was free and the drinks were $5.  To drink, I had the 376 standstill. The first one I got had a fly in it. After that they were fine.  To eat, there was a rotation of appetizers that were all delicious (mind you I did not try the bacon jam or pork belly sliders [vegetarian]). These included shrimp & grits, fries with blue cheese, biscuits with bacon jam, pork belly sliders, vegetable flatbread, pesto mozzarella grilled cheese, caprese flatbread, and mushroom flatbread.  Dessert was a choice of salted caramel cheesecake, chocolate hazelnut mousse, and something else I can't remember ~ each served in a small Mason jar. I got the salted caramel cheesecake, which tasted nothing like salted caramel. It was more like just cheesecake with a ton of caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream. It didn't excite me in the least and I didn't eat it past the first bite. I tried my friends choc hazelnut mousse and it was really good. Light, fluffy, and not too sweet.  What seemed odd to me is that the menu consists of 95% breakfast items, yet we were served nothing breakfast-like. Also, what we were served isn't even on the menu, so I'm not sure what the point of the tasting event was. The bartender even confirmed that the items we had aren't on the menu, and that they only serve the fries on Friday night but they don't tell anyone because they charge $10 for a small bowl of them.  It's real weird.  One thing I absolutely loved is that it had no smell of bacon. For me, that was the best, but for others, they may prefer the bacon odor.",

    "text": "I feel like such a negative Nancy lately...I've been having lackluster dining experiences for a while. I'm beginning to think I'm cursed choosing to come on the wrong day at the wrong time.  But honestly, I feel like I'm justified in my recent poor ratings for these places.  Case in point...  I was excited to try Bakn, having heard of it via word of mouth and then subsequently seeing awesome Yelp reviews.  My husband and I decided to venture to Carnegie on Saturday early afternoon for brunch with our infant son.    When we arrived, we were told that there was a 15 minute wait (they use the NoWait app so consider putting your name in beforehand).  We were fine with the short wait but after 45 minutes and still not called to be seated...we were getting impatient and not to mention HUNGRY!  It was so odd because we saw people coming out and empty tables inside,  some were clean some weren't.  We also saw couples going in and not coming back out which makes me think they got seated...they did get seated, we could see them through the window.    We literally were staring inside the restaurant until the hostess came out and let us know that she's sorry for the long wait but the kitchen is backed up and she's waiting for a group to leave so that we can be seated.  Ummm...what does the kitchen being backed up have to do with getting seated?!?!  I could understand that affecting getting your food but not so much as getting seated.    Ok back to the empty tables.  There was a group that was seated near the window inside (we could see them from the outside) that had left and the table was left uncleaned for 10 minutes.  At this point, we were both getting annoyed and the baby was getting fussy...I mean it had been almost an hour.  I went inside and asked the hostess if we could sit at that table, and her response is that they just left (ummm...10 min ago) and that she needs to wait until someone cleans the table.  Well it turns out that someone was her cleaning the table 5 minutes later at which time she came to get us.  We looked over the menu and decided quickly on the slow braised short rib dish for both of us.  Waitress told us they ran out of short ribs.  Seriously!?!  It was like we couldn't get a break with this place.  Now maybe if we didn't have the most annoying wait for a table, telling us that there were no short ribs wouldn't have been a big deal but it was irritating at this point.   I ended up ordering the breakfast sandwich #1 and my husband got the basic two eggs, bacon and toast combo.  None of which was anything spectacular.   Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was decent but not good enough to make up for the horrible customer service we had just experienced.  I remember that it did have a ton of arugula in it and my husband's dish came out with what seemed like a loaf full of toast.    We won't be back.  I don't ask for special attention because we have a baby, but seriously a little consideration would have been nice when you know that we're waiting outside for an extended period of time with an infant and we were initially told there was a 15 minute wait.  Even without a baby, that's just common restaurant etiquette, or at least I thought it was.     I wish I had taken my husband's suggestion of leaving and going somewhere else when we hadn't been seated or approached after 30 minutes of waiting.",

It reminds me of the speciality restaurants in New York like Egg Shop (a restaurant centered around eggs) or Rice to Riches (a restaurant centered around rice pudding).  Food and Drink Ordered:  * worth trying  - [Peach Raspberry Bellini] : A fruity white wine taste.   - [Bak'n Flight] : I think this appetizer is a good way to try all the different bacon flavors that Bakn has to offer but for a restaurant that specializes in bacon, I thought that the bacon was rather mediocre. The candied bacon was probably my favorite out of the six pieces we received.   - [Bakn 'Cake Tacos] : I thought that the things inside of the taco were pretty meh but I really liked the pancakes. They were the right amount of fluffy.   Would I go back? : Probably not. Like I said before, the concept is pretty cool but the bacon was pretty mediocre despite the food item being the restaurant's namesake. Some of their other food items that my friends had ordered like the Bakn flatbread and loaded fries were pretty promising so I don't think that the restaurant is a complete bust. I would definitely give Bakn a 3.5 but not a 4.",

I was a little confused by the mix of sandwiches and breakfast, but it truly is a combo of everything bacon.  I had the pork belly tacos. The pork belly was tender and a hefty portion. I went with the mixed greens as a side. I don't know what the dressing is (some sort of white balsamic maybe?) but it was fantastic. I'd eat that salad all day long.   Our server was a little off. She seemed genuinely surprised that I ordered pork belly and felt the need to describe how thick and fatty it is. I'm very familiar with pork belly. But she didn't bat an eye when my male dining companion ordered the same. It was just odd and felt judgy.  She didn't come back to refill drinks at all or to check on our meal. We had to chase her down for the check. It was 7 on a Sat night, so it was fairly busy, but there were empty tables so not unreasonable. Staff is the reason for the 3 stars.   I'd go back to try the pancakes, they looked delicious!",

We saw that they had the option to order online but my fiance called earlier in the week to make sure we can order ahead. They acted like it was a huge inconvenience to do take out orders on Mother's Day. They are supposedly busy every single weekend so I don't see a difference. We called this morning to order and again made a big deal about a take out order. YOU OFFER ONLINE ORDERING so I'm not sure why it's a huge deal. They allowed us to order take out and forgot one of our meals. When my fiance called, they asked if we paid for it already. We did pay for it but the girl continued to tell us that if we did not yet she would've comped it. Which would be nice but not necessary to add to the conversation after he said he already paid. Thanks for trying to comp us for the huge inconvenience of having to drive back out but no thanks for not doing anything?   Overall, the food was nothing special. It was good but does not live up to the hype.",

    "text": "Bakn has firmly settled in as a go-to-worthy neighborhood gem in Carnegie.  It represents the kind of interesting and ambitious approach to a quality neighborhood restaurant experience that will hopefully set the standard for others as the rising tide of gentrification further lifts the main street of the Carnegie down town.   The atmosphere and design is attractive, calculated without taking itself too seriously.    The food is always well executed, and again the ambition here comes in to play with a menu that seeks to straddle the entire day's eating options in a single menu experience (save specials, and of course cocktails and libations).   This is the kind of dining experience you want to win, it's the type of restaurant and brand you root for.  It's effortful and thoughtful in its offerings and the service is consistently attentive and accommodating to families and individuals alike.  Their go-to short rib is incredible, along with their pork belly cuban sandwich, and the decadent \"Elvis\" cocktail.  Be sure to order up the \"pig knuckles\" as wonderful first bite that shows off their penchant for porcine perfection.  They've recently expanded their dessert menu, and seem to now be at a stage where the challenge becomes staying fresh and interesting without losing focus on what has made them amazing.  This is truly the test of a restaurant that's transitioning to a mainstay.",

There are off street parking lots everywhere, but they are ALL private lots (bummer) since we went during the prime brunch hour on a a sunny Sunday, street parking was very full and I had to park about 2 blocks away.  2) my Bloody Mary was WEAK! Drinking a $9 watered down Bloody Mary with a cold piece of bacon dipped in was not how I wanted to spend my Sunday funday!  The place was PACKED, and as a first timer, I wasn't aware that I should have reserved a table using the no wait app. Once we were seated I was please to see how trendy/modern the decor was. The restaurant was very clean and I liked the open window in the kitchen to see what everyone was cooking.  The menu had a ton of different options! Burgers, salads, breakfast sandwiches, and even a few vegetarian options! I got the Bakn tacos and was very satisfied! I was looking around at all the other tables and everyone else's food looked amazing as well! Bakn is a nice addition to the Carnegie area. I'm sure I'll return, I'll just have to skip out on the Bloody Marys.",

By the time we left at 10, there were people waiting outside. My husband and I both ordered sammiches - he the 1lb bacon BLT (which he loved, and only ate half) and I, the breakfast sammich #1 (loved and only ate half) - and we split an order of the biscuits and bacon jam (5 stars, you're a fool if you don't try them). Bonus points b/c I subbed a side of fruit for the fries that came with my sammie, and they didn't up-charge for that.  Service was fantastic; our waitress and manager/owner were extremely attentive making sure to keep a constant re-fill of coffee and water.  I docked them 1 star for choice of furniture/crowdedness.  I'm a stickler for good chairs/seating and I wasn't a fan of theirs - they were just uncomfortable.  It was also a little crowded - it's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants try to fit too many tables in a small space, and you end up having to twist and weave to get out. Maybe I'm weird, idk.  In conclusion, the place is awesome and the food was delicious. I thought the prices were fair, despite some of the reviews.  I will be back, and I hope this place does well. #baconforlife",

    "text": "Delightful little cafe in downtown Carnegie. I would go back if someone else chose it but I can't say I'd suggest dining at Bakn.   Met two friends for lunch on a weekday @ 1:00 w a toddler in tow. I must say, the toddler LOVED the atmosphere at Bacn. Phil Collins playing loudly keep the toddler happy and enthused. Our toddler diner had a single plain scrambled egg. Loved it. I did raise an eyebrow at the cost of this single egg. It was about three times what we were charged for an egg while dining at the LaMont just a month age but so be it.  Our toddler diner will eat almost anything but eggs are the favorite. The egg made by Bakn received high reviews. As did almost everything our toddler sampled from the rest of our meals.   Now this is where Bacn left me feeling - eh. I ordered the Bacn grilled cheese. I asked if there was bacon on the sandwich and was told yes. I asked for it to come out on the side. When my meal arrived there was bacon on the sandwich and I was given a side of bacon. Oh well, I guess. Buuuut the sandwich, well, it was good but not fabulous. The bread couldn't maintain the integrity of the sandwich. The cheese, bacon, pesto were sliding out of the sandwich and the central bread had disintegrated into a soggy center. The edges were good. Tasty but not a \"excellent 5 stars\" lunch.  I think this meal could have been saved if the side had been a little better. I ordered fries as a treat for the kid to have a few. Huge mistake. Gross. They were overwhelmingly spiced in a way that left a film on the tongue that's indescribable (garlic?,salt?,msg?,mushroom?what is it?) and need for water. Avoid those fries.   The bacon side was good. Unnecessary, but good.   Now. Pork Belly tacos. That's a different story. They were served to our table with the salad side. Fabulous.   Pancakes = amazing.   So all in all. It was a nice lunch. Cute. Bright. Trendy. A little pricey for what's really a hip diner.Our final check was almost $60.  I'd enjoy visiting again but I won't be disappointed if I don't.",

    "text": "What's Bakn? Well, it is short for the best bacon served with your meal restaurant in Carnegie. Located on East Main St, You enter and are greeted by a pleasant host who asks if you would like a table or sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare your meal.  I opted for a table. I came shortly before the lunch hour when it was not too crowded and was able to be served right away.  They serve breakfast all day and have a full service bar close to the entrance. I opted to try lunch so I ordered a chicken sandwich which comes with your choice of either french fries, coleslaw, or small salad. I went with the coleslaw. I had my meal served on a lined pie plate. The sandwich came with arugula, oven roasted tomato, and bacon. My waitress told me that unless I wanted it there was no need for me to put a condiment on it. The chicken was full of flavor and the bacon was so crisp! I enjoyed every bite of it.  The coleslaw had cranberries and a cream sauce that added a bit of sweetness to it. Not only that my lunch was very reasonably priced. The restaurant is set up with metal chairs all around and by the time I left this place was packed!  I certainly plan to return and try out a breakfast since my waitress explained to me that one of the more popular items was the pan seared gulf shrimp with cream cheddar grits, and sunny side egg. Metered parking is outside but if you are willing to walk a few blocks down they have free parking near the Dollar Tree.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I used Nowait to check-in. After arriving 2 minutes after we got the text that our table was ready, we waited another 5 minutes in the restaurant before anyone even acknowledged that we were standing there. After we were sat, it was close to 10 minutes and still no one acknowledged us or offered us drinks. I had to go up to the bar and ask for two waters and for someone to take our order. The bartender rolled her eyes at me and then brought waters a few minutes later. After watching them sit other people, they were greeted with the menu overview, specials and asked if they wanted anything else besides water.   So we order the biscuits for a starter and the pancake bacon tacos. After waiting about 20 minutes for the biscuits, I ask the waitress if they are coming out before the actual food. Her response \"I hope so\".  So they bring us out the biscuits and there's 4 instead of 5. We ask the waitress, she said she will check on it. Then came back over and said the kitchen knew there was only 4 but didn't want to make us wait for the 5th. 15 minutes later we get our food, still no 5th biscuit. So we ask again, and instead of an apology she tells us she will take it off our bill because she doesn't work in the kitchen so she ant make them bring the missing one out sooner?   Overall the food was really good and probably the only reason why the place is still open. They are incredibly understaffed and the staff that was on none of them seemed like they actually wanted to be there or even liked their job.   I am giving two stars Instead of one because I would order food from there again but only if it was takeout.",

I have a sweet spot for places in town that are off-the-beaten-path and aren't so well known that everybody and their mothers go there. This is that place and definitely worth the trip to Carnegie.   The Bakn martini is smooth and balanced with a smoky after-taste and it seriously might be one of my favorite cocktails of all time. I'm a sucker for polenta so I had the slow-braised short ribs and thought it was good and an interesting dish but felt like my bowl was a little luke warm. For my next drink, the waitress recommended a bourbon and bacon pairing trio - three different types of bourbon and three different cuts and seasonings of bacon. Even without the fabulous Bakn martini, I would come back for this alone. We also tried two of the dessert cups (I honestly don't know how we even ended up with them) and I didn't love them, only because I was so in love with everything else.   South Hills and western suburbs kinfolk, get to Bakn if you haven't already.",

We wait for someone to greet us for literally a solid 7 minutes... the girl at the bar was directly in front of us the whole time and never even looked up to let us know someone would be with us. Finally a young guy gets our name and we had a 20 minute wait. We decided it would be best to wait outside because it was rather busy.   So we get to our table, it's a large high top and we only fill half of it. So eventually they seat more people on the other side. Now, the food was amazing totally worth it. However our server was borderline creepy. Lady with short blonde hair, she comes up to us to let us know she'll be right with us and the behavior she displayed just strange... like creepy smiles, lingering weirdly, telling us she had to go do 15 things before taking our drink order when she would have just done it then. After our first interaction with her, our table just all looked at each other like \"is this lady high??!!\" She was totally bizarre, so we finally order after like 25 minutes and the whole time we are ordering she's giving her \"recommendations\" I got the #2 breakfast sandwich, aka it's salmon. Her recommendation for my sandwich was to \"add an egg\" feeling awkward I just said \"sure\" then we eventually get our food and I hear her taking the order of the group next to us and I hear her say \"I recommended an egg on that!\" THEN DEAD STARES ME SMILES AND GIGGLES!!! Like you definitely are up charging people for the hell of it...   Not to mention to start 3 of us ordered Mimosas at the beginning and it took awhile to get them to the two other people asked for another and I didn't and the still being over 3 freaking mimosas and charge me for the one I didn't ask for.   But hey they food was damn good, just don't give into the whole \"add an egg on that\" crap.",

    "text": "Waitress: 1st Time Debbie. 2nd Time Michelle  Music Type: Kiss I Was Made For Loving You  The first time we visited we had an amazing experience. We didnt have any change and Debbie gave us 4 quarters for the parking meter (2 hours) . It was this past Friday around 11am. The flight of bakn is definitely recommended as a appetizer, this place knows how to do bakn...period. I got the shrimp and grits and the french toast and would order both again. The shrimp are still shelled which is great aesthetically but take away from the eating experience. The grits could also be more seasoned.   The second time we went was on a sunday afternoon where it was incredibly busy. I would definitely recommend using the app \"no wait\" it put us in line at #7 before even leaving the house. I wild also advise you to seek out the host, she is positioned in such a way that you would never know she was the host and doesn't look towards the door to see if new customers are coming in and need assistance.    Our waitress this time seemed irritated that we didn't know what we wanted on her first pass so if its a busy day, study the menu and be ready to order as soon as your sat or she may leave you to think about it for 10-13 minutes. The home-fries came out relatively fast. They were not bad but they are deep fried so dont expect potatoes right off some cast iron skillet.   The beef short ribs were EXCELLENT and i see now why they dont overly season the grits, the sauce from the beef short ribs does the job they were slightly lukewarm. With the shrimp however there is no sauce which leaves them lacking. The french toast was good again, not spectacular but not bad either. Our server was lacking again and did not check on us after delivering the food until it was time to pay the bill.",

The hostess asked if we would sit at the kitchen bar, i said of course. Who doesn't like watching their food be prepared?  The mimosa and bloody were some of the best i have ever had. The drink menu had something for everyone. We had the Bananas Foster French Toast, Fritatta and Bakn Bakn Bakn omelet. It was so much food and delicious!  We cant wait to go back!",

Also there can be a wait, but they have the Nowait app and I definitely recommend using it. Great brunch spot!",

    "text": "There were four of us for a Sunday Brunch with the understanding there would be a wait.  We waited about an hour to get in.  Once we sat, we ordered bloody marys and breakfast.  The bloody marys came out without the advertised Peppered Bacon.  The $9 bloody marys were not that tasty and we asked the waitress and she stated that they were out of Peppered Bacon.  Bakn ran out of bacon.  Not sure why she didn't mention that when we ordered.  She mentioned she would provide a discount and only offered $.90 because she didn't want to get in trouble by her manager (not sure why someone would get in trouble for crediting a meal due to not providing food as described).  The bacon flight costs $8 and get 5x strips of bacon.  That would make each strip of bacon $1.60 each not $.90 which she just pulled out of the air.  Regarding the food, apparently they were going to take it upon themselves to substitute the peppered bacon with another flavor that they chose fit.  We inserted which bacon we wanted.  I ordered the Braised Short Rib bowl, it was okay but I should of ordered two because it is a small portion.  Overall, our experience was not pleasurable and we will not be returning.",

The French fries were great too. Although I usually am not a fan of fries, theirs are definitely the exception. They toss them in rosemary and some other herbs. The little extras are what make this place. Service was great. I've already recommended it to several people. Can't wait to go back.",

Menu is nice blend of breakfast/bar food staples and of course, plenty of bacon and belly.  My family was seated at the kitchen bar and we watched the hustle bustle of the kitchen team, pretty organized and clean.  The bakn omelette was prepared with bacon bits, not chunks or thick strips/pieces, but disappointing thin extra crispy bits.  The pancakes are great and fresh squeezed OJ is a bit pricey for the serving size, but yummy.  Our burger was cooked incorrectly and promptly taken care of without much fuss.  Bread used for breakfast and sandwich's is delicious and lots of butter in use (maybe a tad to much).  I will go back, but not get bacon, i can make better bacon at home from the grocery store.  Also I watched the kitchen staff use a microwave to heat up a stuffed pepper looking dish... Overall for the price, location, food quality and service this a decent spot and i look forward to exploring more.",

Seated right away and our server came over with menus and asked what we wanted to drink. I asked about a wine list and she said \"we don't have one just tell me what you want\" and I said \"well, I don't know what you have\" she said red or white ( honestly made me feel like an idiot for asking) I said that I wanted white and she replied \"Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay or Reisling\" So I just said Reisling, I wasn't about to ask what kind. Drinks came and it was a good wine. My oldest ordered chocolate chip pancakes, I ordered the pan seared salmon and my youngest ordered shrimp and grits. Pancakes were huge. We could have fed 2 adults easily and they were good. The shrimp and grits were good but I have had better. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the polenta was very tasty. The food itself was pretty good but I just felt like we irritated the server, at least she seemed that way. When we left 2 other servers said \"bye, have a nice night\" I will probably go back.",

Unfortunately, that's the only thing I've had on on the menu.  I imagine I will try the place one more time for breakfast, and probably wont go back.  I do live about 2 miles away.  The waiter was fun and the hostess was very sweet.  Beside that, it is very loud and cramped like crazy. It is very small, always packed, and there is no waiting area. They text you to come back when your table is ready!  Not a good idea for Pittsburgh, when the temps are in the single digits and there is nowhere to wait especially with no parking lot so parking wayyy down the street is common.  The cocktail I had was horrible.  It was some kind of bellini and it tasted like rot gut Boone's Farm haha!.  I did enjoy their cook's and waiters' tshirts though....one of them said \"I like PIG butts and I cannot lie\". lol  Cute!",

I have no problem paying for a good meal, but this was definitely not worth it. To start, the bloody mary was one of the worst I've ever had. It was watery tomato juice with bland horseradish and a slimey piece of bacon. Took a few sips and set it aside. The caprese flatbread was doused in some kind of pesto sauce and the crust was soggy and doughey instead of thin and crisp. Didn't finish this either. Also tried the bacon flight . . . 5 pieces of bacon, each prepared a different way. 5 pieces of thin, limp bacon that I left on the plate. The only thing I did finish was the soda water (not Perrier or San Pallegrino, mind you, but soda water from the bar gun) for which they charged me $2 and called \"sparkling water\" on the bill, which totalled $31. Next time I head to Carnegie, it will not be to Bakn.",

My wife got the traditional french toast & no e fries. I got the chicken & cakes (their take on chicken & waffles). The no e fries were the best I've ever had. The chicken and cakes were a home run. 3 thin bacon stuffed pancakes topped with bacon & green onion went great with the chicken & maple syrup. We each had coffee and it was just what we needed for our 3 hour drive home. The portions were a great size we keft feeling content instead of still hungry or overly full.

Still we are so glad that we finally got here to try out their bacon.   We arrived here around 240pm on a Sunday afternoon.  It was busy when we first got here and we found two seats for us at the bar.  This was the end of their brunch rush for the day so it was perfect timing for us.       We were so hungry but it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted.  Do we go breakfast or lunch?  My wife eventually went with lunch and I almost did too but I was intrigued by their Bakn cake taco I had to try it out.  My wife convinced me to try something new and I'm glad that I did.  It was really good.  Just a great combination of pancake, egg, and bacon.  It hit the spot.  I needed to take a nap after it was so heavy but worth it.  My wife ordered their pork belly tacos and they were good but her tortillas came out cold which ruined the tacos for her.  That was disappointing but everything else was really good.       I wasn't in the mood for a beer and the food was heavy so I decided to get a Irish coffee that really hit the spot for me.  I loved it and my wife ordered their Bloody Mary which was really good too.       We do want to come back and try something else here.  I'd probably order a burger or a sandwich next time and maybe my wife will go breakfast.  Anyway we had a good brunch and this is as good as everybody has been saying.",

It was decent with the egg yolk breaking nicely through out it.  I broke a piece of the pork belly off before eating the sandwich and it was very good.  My only complaint is the bacon was way too crisp/hard.   My husband had the bacon BLT.  There's supposed to be a pound of bacon on it but we both agreed there was no way it had near that much bacon.  His bacon was just as hard. And said with a BLT especially that it should be freshly made. They allowed him to substitute the sour dough with a Texas toast type bread.

I feel like there should be delicious coffee to accompany the outstanding food - but that wasn't the case on the house coffee.   Bathroom trash can was overflowing with trash.",

    "text": "My friend and I visited Bakn for brunch today. My friend thought ahead and checked in using the No Wait app. I highly recommend doing that as the wait was over an hour and the app got us seated soon after we arrived! Parking was limited so we both had to drive around for a bit.  As the wait time suggests, the place was packed. Our server was super friendly and helpful. We both ordered brunch drinks. My Bloody Mary was really tasty, and I was glad that it came with both a pickle and bacon! My friend and I both ordered a breakfast sandwich which came with a side of home fries. Both were very good! I especially like the home fries - chunks of potatoes with crispy outsides/soft middle. After a bloody mary - this type of home fries are my favorite brunch indulgence! We also both left with to-go boxes.   My experience here got off to a rocky start after I received unpleasant service from an employee. However, after asking for the employees name, the manager took it upon herself to inquire with the employee about what happened. The manager then came to talk to me about it/apologize. Then the employee actually came over to apologize and offered me a drink! It was really thoughtful of them to make the efforts to make my experience at Bakn better. I really appreciated the customer service I received from both the manager and the employee. My friend and I were both impressed with their efforts. We will definitely be returning.",

We headed there around 11:30am - we were able to use NoWait to get line while we were driving, so the wait went pretty fast. We only had to wait 7 minutes for our table to be ready.   I literally wanted to try everything on the menu. It all sounded amazing. I started off with the Sunshine Mimosa- it was delicious.   For our entree, I ordered the Four Cheese Omelette - it comes with home fries and I got an order of applewood smoked bacon. The omelette was to die for and the bacon was perfectly crispy - just the way I like it.   We split an order of the Fresh Berry Cakes - they were amazing- fresh blueberries and strawberries and it comes it a berry syrup (you can ask for regular syrup too.)   My friend ordered the Breakfast Sandwich #1 and loved it. Her sandwich also came with home fries (btw they are out of this world)   We spent about an hour and half at Bakn & I'm ready to go back. It was constantly busy, so make sure the NoWait app to score a table.",

This place is basically a breakfast all day kind of restaurant. What I love about this place is the logo, the pig icon is SOOOOO CUTTTTEEEEEE!  Peach Bellini: Nice classy glass of peach Bellini. It was sweet and light just like fruit wine.  Breakfast sandwich #1: I ordered this because I saw many other reviewers ordered it too. It was a good standard breakfast sandwich with egg, arugula, tomatoes, cheese, and last but not least, bacon!! However, the bacon flavor did not stand out to me, and I was a it disappointed. I can probably make something like this at home and it'll taste just as good. The potatoes were very good though, crispy yet soft.   VERDICT:  Would I order the breakfast sandwich again? Probably not  Would I go back again? Probably not. However, if you like breakfast food, give it a try.",

    "text": "The only reason I give this restaurant 1 stars is because the server was attentive and friendly. The food was simply inedible. 3 if us ordered the Cuban, one ordered the shrimp Mac n cheese. We could not bite through the pork belly, the entire 1\" by 4\" slab fell out of the sandwich as we embarrassingly couldn't get it out of our mouths fast enough. Even at our best attempt at gnawing through it, it was impenetrable. Maybe if you sharpened your teeth and chiseled at it with fangs you could get through it, at which point you would discover it was also completely lacking any flavor whatsoever. It resembled a slab of dry gristle, instead of tender and flavorful pork belly. I could use the pork belly slab as a rawhide bone for my dog- it will give him weeks of chewing. The shrimp Mac n cheese was at least suitable to eating but could've used some seasoning. Needless to say we were still hungry because we couldn't finish our meals, and ordered a piece of salted caramel cheesecake from the dessert menu to share. The cheesecake came in a mason jar and was impossible to share, which the server did not mention. We spooned it out of the mason jar onto each plate and inevitably someone received openly whipped cream out of the top half of the jar. We left Bakn feeling like we need to get our stomachs pumped and our bodies power washed. I would recommend only getting drinks here and do not attempt to eat here unless you can gamble being sick the rest of the day. Our office now calls this restaurant \"Food Poison-R-us\".",

For appetizers we got the grilled cheese sandwich flight, those were super tasty and good. If you get an appetizer thats a great option to share with 2-3 more persons... My husband got the pig pen burguer he says it was really good... and I got the bakncake tacos, I always goes to wherever the server offer, because who knows better than them? So she told me they were featured on food network... so I got my tacos.. they were 3 small pancakes with eggs, bakn, urugula and honey on the side! They were super good.. I love sweet and salty meals so they were great for my taste! The only downside its that they were supper messy to eat, but if you don't care those are a great option!",

The fresh squeezed OJ mimosa was delightful, and the coffee with fresh creamer was tasty. I ordered the Bakn, Bakn, Bakn omelette and unfortunately, I couldn't taste the three different flavored bacons at all. I was a little disappointed! The omelette itself was really good though with melty mozzarella, but the bacon wasn't really what I wanted it to be.  The atmosphere at Bakn really wins. Loved the cute little piggy decor all over, and the paint colors (I can't believe I'm talking about paint colors haha) were calming and nice. I was surprised they have a full bar, and there are tons of bar seats! Also, we had great service.   Things I'd like to try there, and I will update my review accordingly: the bakn appetizer to really try the different flavors, breakfast sandwich, bakn stuffed pancakes, pork belly tacos - the list goes on! They have happy hour specials and different specials for weeknight dining as well.   Listen, very important for dining here!!! If you don't get in on the No Wait app action, then you are going to wait, period. We walked right into our table, while others were told up to a 45 minute wait. Especially helpful I'm sure if you have a bigger party!",

    "text": "Across from funeral home I had to visit , and looked interesting, was late at nite and we were the only couple there.  Girl that greeted us was not friendly which was sign of a bad nite.  long story short , the Tacos were terrible and served with a slab of pure fat, I guess was supposed to be bacon, but the chief must have missed it and serve an actual slab of fat, I have never had that happen in my life. The Reuben was fatty and bit dry and just not good.  I had to ask for a side pickle.  Side order of Mac and cheese was hands down, the worst I have had, bland at best.   Asked about coffee and she said could re-heat the old coffee at 15 minute wait time.  Service was not good, wait time for food was slow,  the one tasty item was the fries.  Saw all the good reviews so leaving a two star, should be one star, maybe just a bad night with a bad crew.  I left great tip cause I just felt bad.  visit was nite of  1/24/2018",

Since we were on a time crunch, we made reservations for our group brunch. We were told we could wait, or sit at the bar in the back. We had to sit at the bar facing the kitchen and cooks and inconveniently talking around each other to hold a conversation. The only this that made this trip worth it was the delish food! Bloody Mary was okay, not worth $10 in my opinion, but the food was bangin'!",

I ordered the frittata which was served with mushrooms, sauteed red onions and home fries and topped with lightly dressed arugula.  The combination was delicious.  My son ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and the lightly dressed arugula served on toasted sourdough bread.  He really liked the combination as well.  We both had fresh squeezed orange juice and my son had a caramel latte.  Both were very good.  Our first visit was a success.... I'll be back with my wife in the near future to try other items on the menu.",

I would definitely recommend that you start your meal this way! I ordered the short rib and polenta for my meal. I enjoyed the meat but the polenta needed more flavor, in my opinion. My husband had the cheeseburger and loved it. Our friends had the BLT, which was so stuffed with bacon that it was almost too much, and the vegetarian sandwich, which was great even for a place specializing in bacon! Because I didn't want to look like a pig in front of or friends I didn't order dessert but I wanted to! Next time for sure!  The decor was really cool inside. It was enough of the popular \"hip\" style with reclaimed wood and all that but a lot of modern American elements. I say this at a lot of places I go but to me it didn't feel like I was in a Pittsburgh restaurant. I felt like I was in a cool restaurant in New York or even London. I'd like to go back for sure!",

The girls seated next to us were drinking peach bellinis and they looked amazing so that's what I ordered to drink - my \"beau\" ordered a Beermosa. All of the food looked amazing as it was being delivered to people sitting around us - I decided to try the chicken n cakes - DELICIOUS. Way more than enough food for one person though, so if you're not too hungry, split it with someone or prepare to take some home. I can't remember what my bf ordered but it came with home fries that were basically the best breakfast potatoes I think we've ever had. If you're in the area, this place is a MUST TRY!",

When I first walked in I was greeted and sat, and it was surprisingly a lot bigger than what one would think from the outside. It has such a cool vibe (as well as a great playlist!) with two big bars, one in the kitchen and one in the main room,   Service was excellent, the waitress was on point and very friendly. As well as having servers walk around to refill water and coffee, a HUGE plus when it's the morning and in need for both.   The real star here is the food. I had the breakfast sandwich #1, and my friend had the berry waffle. Both were VERY good, the baknaise sauce on my sandwich was what put it over the top for me. I would say the only downer was that my potatoes were cold... but still the taste was pretty good. There are definitely a lot more items on the menu that I'll come back to try.   Good job Bakn!",

The service is however where they lost me. The first time was a Sunday mid afternoon and while it was steady, there was still many open tables and the wait for service shouldn't have been the way it was considering i could see my server chatting it up 3/4 of the time with her friends at a table that was sat..... The second time. A man kept coming in and out of the door asking people for money and when I approached my waitress she just kinda shrugged it off and said \"sorry for him, he does that sometimes\" well I understand another guys hustle, but I was trying to enjoy myself on an evening out and it was becoming a nuisance to keep having to tell this man no the second time after i gave him a few bucks the first. Was delicious tho and kudos to the kitchen.",

Both were delicious, but I was partial to my order. I really enjoyed the way the tangy components of the sandwich helped to cut through the delicious fattiness of the pork belly. The tacos were also delicious, though I would have preferred a little more sauce to keep them nice and moist.   Service was good, but inconsistent and at times we felt like we needed to hunt down our waitress for things, but the food came out quickly and luckily we did not need a lot after the food came out, because we would have had a hard time getting help at that point.   Overall we really liked it and will be back! I definitely see a blt in our future!",

I loved the Graceland Grille sandwich featuring peanut butter, banana (yes BANANA) and bacon on thick cut grilled Texas toast.  Really tasty.  Their service was really terrific and the owner/chef were gracious hosts for a lovely evening.  For the grilled cheese course, we liked the fig and bleu cheese and pesto tomato offerings.  Keep up the fab bacon recipes!  Great addition to Carnegie.",

My only complaint was that chairs and especially the booth seats were not very comfortable with little or no back support.  Glancing at the menu I was a bit disappointed at first look at the limited options.  Full disclosure: I don't eat pork so at a restaurant named Bakn I knew  that my choices would be limited.   We ordered the frittata and the French toast.  With my first bite of the frittata I knew it was something special.  The flavors were spot on.  The potatos were also wonderful even if a bit over salted.  The greens had just the right touch of dressing.  I would order this dish over and over, it was that good.  The French toast was less exciting.  It was prepared just fine but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was served with an almond flavored syrup which tasted slightly artificial and I thought ruined the entire dish.  So net net, you should definitely give this place a try.  Order the frittata - it's delish.  A great addition to the Pittsburgh breakfast  scene in resurging Carnegie.",

    "text": "\"Meh\" is really an accurate description of this place.   I'm a big fan of bacon, so I figured why not check it out.   A few friends had mentioned that they liked it too.  Upon arriving at Bakn, I was impressed with the venue.  It had a nice vibe to it, and I loved the artwork on the walls.   I saw on the chalk board that they had a $5 pork belly slider special.   We asked for that as a starter.  Our server said that she didn't think that was an option because of some tap takeover that was going on.  I told her that it's right on the chalk board, and she said that she'd have to check and get back to us.   They did have sliders, but they were pulled pork.   Fine.   If only there were some way to update chalk boards, they could have avoided this trouble...  First, the arrival of the sliders:  We were greeted with two sliders.   Normally, I'd expect 3 to an order, but they never specified, nor did I ask how many there were.  They were OK, but the pulled pork I make in my slow cooker is much better!  The meat wasn't smoked, so that means that the sauce and bun have got to shine.  The sauce had a cheap nondescript grocery-store BBQ flavor, and the bun was just a standard white bread bun.  Yawn.  The flatbread:   We went with the fig and blue cheese, and added bacon.  Overpowering all other flavors was the sugary sweet fig jam of a sauce.  If my eyes were closed, I don't think I could have told you that the cheese was blue cheese.  There was also arugula and bacon on top, but I couldn't taste either over top of all the sugar.  The salad:   Field greens with crispy pork belly.   I don't know if they just grabbed the wrong pork belly or if they don't understand what crispy means.   But this belly was the opposite of crispy.  Consistency-wise, think tepid Wonder bread soaked in water.  The croutons weren't crispy either.  They were stale, hard, and a bit chewy.  Who knows... maybe breakfast is the way to go with this place.  I won't find out, though.  $40 for our split light dinner of consistently sub-par food isn't a thing that would draw me out to Carnegie again.",

No acknowledgement, explanation or apology from the wait staff. Disappointing.  The Fresh Berry Pancakes were heavenly - and enormous (definitely a shareable portion.) The Shrimp and Grits was especially good. And the Chicken & Cakes was some really great chicken!  I think our advice for next time might be to order an appetizer to take the edge off while we wait.",

    "text": "Incredible!  From the sumptuous food, to the personable servers/staff, to the quirky wall art - all fabulous.  I was with a large-ish group (11) and they handled it perfectly.  Even though they were rather busy, the owner/chef visited our table several times, chatted with us to make sure all was well, and refilled our coffee as needed - much more than the typical obligatory, \"Is everything okay?\"  I love that personal touch.  I had the bacon-stuffed pancakes (it has a much more clever name on the menu) with a side order of grits.  Both were excellent - the pancakes were huge and delicious.  But the grits stole the show - extremely flavorful and just the right texture.    Everyone in my group enjoyed their meals - from specialized omelets, to flat breads, to pan seared shrimp and grits, to fried chicken & pancakes, all the way to regular ol' scrambled eggs, bacon, & home fries - all were exceptional.    One more thing that will keep me coming back for more... the 80's music!  :)  Well done, Bakn!",

The restaurant is small but has a very intimate feel. The restaurant has some cute pig art on the walls and I saw that the sign at the bar for bourbon and bacon flights which looked delicious.. I hope to try that when I go for brunch! We started dinner with the grilled cheese flight, it was the perfect size appetizer for two people.  For my main I got the chicken caprese sandwich with a side of dressed greens. The sandwich was very filling and really delicious. I have has a caprese salad many times before but this was a unique twist on an old favorite. I plan to go back for brunch soon, I am excited to try the breakfast tacos!",

Unsatisfying but I baked it for 20 minutes and it was perfect.  We have had brunch there and it was perfect, just don't go there just before closing.

There was very little bacon on the eggs which seeing as it is the restaurant namesake and the dish is Bakn x3 I was expecting uuum bacon to be in most bites not just dusted over the top. The eggs were very over done.   My order also also did not have the mozzarella on it either. I thought maybe that changed along with the bacon loss but upon checking the menu when leaving it was still on the updated menu. I think some cheese could have helped the eggs as they were far under what I would expect at a diner let alone a nice little restaurant like this for $10.   I may just have hit things at the wrong time, but being from out of the area I won't see this place at its best.",

    "text": "I don't know what happened to this place but it took a titanic route to dining disappointment. Had eaten here a few times last year and had good experiences. However, tonight we went for dinner and the place is an utter train wreck. I should've known something was up - we went on a Friday night during prime dining hours and there were four tables full in the whole restaurant. That's a bad sign but I didn't want to see it that way because I was hungry and excited to eat there.   I love to sit and watch the kitchen work in any restaurant and they have kitchen counter seating available at Bakn. We sat where we normally do to enjoy the kitchen and witnessed disorganization, confusion, but most worrisome was the food safety violations. Maybe someone called off or they lost their decent cooks...I don't know...but the cook tonight touched everything, didn't wash his hands once, didn't wear gloves, and he wiped his sweat then finger-touched plated food before setting it under the heat lamp. Should've known it wasn't going to be a good experience by how many dishes were plated wrong - the waitstaff looked frustrated and over it. Needless to say the wait is long because the food is made incorrectly to what was ordered and the poor people trying to serve it send it back before it even gets to your table.   It's pretty hard to order something when you watch every dish come out wrong and handled in a dirty way. It's so sad that this place has spiraled so badly. Did their Food Network appearance make them complacent? I don't know, I just know that it was once a well run restaurant and now you get to pay to be disappointed/underwhelmed. Also, the major concerns about their food safety practices is probably going to deter my family from venturing there again.",

My companion and I ordered the bacon flight as an appetizer. All of the varieties were delicious: the candied was sweet yet subtle, the peppered was spicy and earthy, and the Sriracha had the perfect kick.  As my meal I ordered the Pork Belly Cuban. I appreciated how it had all of the necessary components of a Cubano: mustard, pickles, ham, cheese, and pork. The bread could've been toasted a bit more for me to give the sandwich more structure--I took one bite and instantly lost a piece of pork belly--but overall it was a very yummy sandwich and was definitely a Cubano.  I highly recommend Bakn! Come for the bacon, stay for the atmosphere created by lots of pig paintings.",

The bacon flight was delicious. The Bakn tacos were everyone's favorite. The frittata was well prepared and very flavorful. Even the bread served with the frittata was outstanding. My daughter had the bananas foster French toast. It was great but a little too sweet for me.",

The breakfast menu is large with pancakes and sandwiches and daily specials. The lunch menu is just as good with sandwiches burgers pasta and salads. The great thing is, you can get all of it anytime. We had the grilled cheese, which was fresh and cheesy with a tasty pesto spread. We also had the BLT with a lb of bacon!! It was delicious! The bread was fresh and crispy and the sandwich had a bacon mayo spread which would have made a great sandwich on its own. We also has the chocolate chip pancakes which was as large as the plate and some of the best I've had! We got to sit and the bar and watched the guys make our lunch, which is always one of my favorite things. It's a great place in a very cool spot on Main Street as part of the reassurance of Carnegie.",

Sat at the kitchen counter and the operations team looked disorganized.  They mixed up a couple of our orders, but to their credit, corrected mistakes without question and very quickly.  My biggest disappointment was my pork belly ruben.  See picture.  The pork belly looked and tasted like it was boiled and the overall flavor was pretty bland.  Best part was the bread.  Also the rest of the family's food was okay, but nothing noteworthy.  Seasoned fries are very good and it looks like they use fresh ingredients.  Again, maybe our experience was due to a busy dinner service, but that should not be an excuse when there is up to 6 people for the kitchen stations.  The decor and atmosphere is friendly and the service was good.  We may give it another try for breakfast as most of the positive reviews were for breakfast.",

The portion sizes are not disappointing, and the service is great.   There are two counters you can sit at, one that faces the bar, and the other faces the kitchen.  Last time I sat at the kitchen counter, my dog wouldn't leave me alone for days.   Personal favorites of mine include the Bakn-stuffed cakes, and the Salmon cous-cous.  The food so nice, they named it twice!  I've had the amazing grilled cheese flight and love to dip that in the minestrone soup.  They take AMEX which is great for business meetings.  The only downside is the metered street parking.  Make sure to bring change. Try a bacon flight.  If you dare!",

    "text": "I heard some online chatter about BAKN and decided to give this place a try, how could I resist an entire menu of bacon!   I was more than excited to try the Bloody Mary with bacon-infused vodka, couldn't wait till happy hour...I needed it for brunch ASAP! But to be completely honest, it didn't do it for me for a few reasons. Maybe I had high expectations, but it wasn't what I wanted/expected.   The bacon Bloody Mary was too watery for me. There wasn't much substance to hold it all together like you'd expect. The horseradish was at the bottom with the tomato, the top layer was all water and tomato juice. So I had to continuously stir it just to get a good mix. It wasn't spicy (tasted bland) so I had to add hot sauce when my meal arrived. The peppered bacon garnish was also floppy and not crispy. Nobody likes sad, floppy bacon. :(   It needs to be thicker, give it some Oomph, but not like a bacon Bloody Mary smoothie! And for the love of bacon use a crispy piece of bacon as garnish. Confession: I totally ate the floppy bacon anyway.   The food, however, more than made up for it. My mom ordered the slow braised short ribs with polenta and sunny side up egg and holy heck was it worth it. The plenty was creamy and the ribs were tender. Definitely a good combo!   I had the breakfast sandwich of bacon, egg, arugula , Jarlsberg cheese, and roasted tomato. Phenomenal. Totally worth it. The bacon was crispy, the cheese was gooey, and the roasted tomato gave it a really nice smokey tang.   Overall, for a first visit and for brunch the meal was pretty damn good.  Except for the sad bacon Bloody Mary. I'm holding you guys responsible for setting the bar on a good bacon Bloody Mary, especially if bacon is your thing. Maybe the cocktails are better in the evening with a dedicated bar person. I dunno.  I'll give you guys another try. (Those pancakes sounded awesome!) :)",

The staff really went above and beyond for the Yelp event, and I think between that and my subsequent visits it feels like I've tried every single thing on the menu.  And there hasn't been a single bad bite.    Most of the reviews seem to be from breakfast or brunch, but I love going here for dinner.  The sandwiches and burgers are packed with flavor.  If you love bacon, there are plenty of options where bacon is the star of the dish.  But they have done an excellent job of infusing bacon in creative and subtle ways that add a huge punch of flavor to give a unique spin on some standard dishes.  It's a great place to stop at for different meals and jump around the menu.  I'm typically someone who finds my 1-2 favorites at a restaurant and sticks to them, but I'm excited to try something different ever time I'm at Bakn.",

The decor is cool, urban warehouse vibe. The artwork is awesome. It was inviting and fun, not trendy or hipster, like so many new restaurants try to be... 2. The ice tea and coffee is fresh and tasty. 3. The seasonings on the French fries are quite wonderful, I think it's Rosemary... 4. You must try the bacon honey jam and biscuits. The biscuits are small, silver dollar size. A novel appetizer. 5. I counted 10 pieces of bacon on my BLT. 6. The staff was very friendly and good at their jobs.  CONS 1. A little pricey, but you are paying for quality. 2. One appetizer lets you sample BAKN's different bacons. The bacon was delicious (could have been a bit crispier). Trouble is, aside from the peppered bacon and the candied, it was hard to discern what the other types were. 3. The arugula, oh, the arugula. I hope you like a little bacon with your arugula... I ordered the bacon flatbread, which apparently means a wee bit of bacon crumbles on flavorless cheese, with a mountain of arugula on top. Same with the BLT.  Too much of this stuff, it almost makes you wonder what there are trying to compensate for or hide. This was the main negative of my visit. 4. The parking. Good luck trying to park at peak mealtimes. Or any other time.   Do not think for one minute that I will not return. The food was delicious. I want to try their breakfast offerings next time... AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME!!!",

And for Bakn it's delicious, hearty, meat filled dishes. Omg that sentence just makes me hungry. Two visits to this place and a 3rd happening later today, I'm hooked. The atmosphere and decor is so fun and unexpected. So as soon as you walk in you know you're in for a treat. Then comes the food, the honey/bacon jam with biscuits is truly top notch! I still think about it!   My first visit there I went basic and had the BLT. It was so very good. I personally found it a little bland overall, but I'm convinced they do that to allow you to take in all the flavors their dishes have to offer. The salty balances with the citrus/tart etc. they're well composed dishes for sure! My second visit was for dinner so I ventured into the burgers and it was very good! Again not a ton of flavors overwhelming, but instead well balanced ones. I like French fries, but I don't like LOVE them, but theirs I inhaled.   I can't wait to go back, later today. Lol",

Unfortunately, there are too many tables, and the waitresses have to squeeze between tight spaces to get from one table to the next. We were sitting at the bar, and I had to move because the waitress kept annoyingly bumping and sliding againsty chair. It was absurd.   2. The food was exquisite in my opinion, but not my husbands. It took about 20 minutes from order to arrival. I had the short ribs breakfast, which was divine. My hubby had the Bakn cakes. He was unimpressed. I thought they were alright, but not nearly as tasty as the short ribs.   3. The service: great! Lance, the bartender was super nice and attentive.   4.

    "text": "As any experienced diner may know if the name of a restaurant gives you a hint just go ahead and take it... that's right, if you choose to order something that is not bacon or does not contain bacon you are missing out, at best, setting yourself up for failure at worst. If it's you're first time I recommend the bacon flight, with six flavors of bacon this is a tasty investment...for your first time...if you trust me enough to jump the gun just get a full order of the Cajun bacon and skip the other five. Now for food get either the bacon cake tacos or the cakes and waffles. Why? They are in boxes on the menu and obvious signature items. The price is intense but the cakes are so full of bacon and egg it really is enough for two people to share. My friend tried the shrimp macaroni and cheese (not heeding the aforementioned advice) and it was classically decent, hardly one of the best Mac and cheeses you'll find in Pittsburgh. Overall the menu is robust, the service is good and the concept is great. Just dont make the mistake of not getting the bacon or bakn, if you catch my drift.",

I've always been a big fan of pork belly but WOW this makes me never want to eat it again. Watching my husband try to take a bite or chew the meat was nauseating. It was just a big slab of hard white meat - think a thick pork chop on stale bread with no flavor. I wish we had said something while there but we didn't.   I had the blue cheese burger and it really didn't have any flavor - even with bacon and onions on it.... it was edible at least, unlike the reuben.   We both were sick in two hours after we got home, could have been coincidence- though not likely.   Sorry no pictures- wasn't the type of meal you would photograph. I highly suggest the restaurant take the pork belly off the menu all together until someone learns how to cook it.",

    "text": "First Visit impression:  Dropped by for breakfast during the weekend.  Quick summary:  Modern Dining room is clean and spacious.  Service was normal and was expected.  Food wise, salmon breakfast sandwich was delicious. The braised short rib, however, was really bland and dry.  Two nice sized chunks was placed on top of another bland pool of soupy elements.  I tried adding hot sauce, salt and pepper and that did not help.  The manager was accommodating though and took it back with no issues.  The orange juice was shocking expensive for $4 so not ordering that again!  I would come back for salmon sandwich.     Second visit:  Got the salmon sandwich again but this time added a side of Jamaican Jerk bacon.    Sandwich:  Fish overcooked and was dry.  No where near the same thing I had in my last visit. Bacon:  requested extra crispy.  It took them 20 minutes to get it out to the table and it was soft and soggier than a wet noodle.  I sent it back 2 times before it got crispy!  Note:  if the name of your place is Bakn and you specialize in all kinds of bacon, why does it take 45 minutes and 3 times to make crispy bacon?  Not returning.",

DO NOT TRY THE SHORT RIBS. The entree was super bland and  dry. Total lack of flavor. Luckily the the manager was nice enough to remove it from our bill.  My GF ordered the pancake tacos which I shared with her and that was pretty tasty, but nothing unique about it.",

So the food was SO GOOD. Hands down did NOT expect the food to be so good!!! I think I ordered an off the menu item which was like a Tennessee patty melt??? and the grilled chicken sandwich. My coworker and I split it/ cut them in half.   Both were equally delicious! Had to take turns taking bites of each because they were so good. The chicken was fantastic! The meat in the melt was also super good! Not chewy or anything. Before I started my meal, I asked the waiter for some dipping sauces... he kept looking at me from the counter and I would look back ... but he still never brought it.   When the waiter was cleaning the table, he picked up the plates and then somehow tipped it and got trash/leftover food all over my clothes. Thankfully I wasn't wearing anything too fancy. Didn't get much of an apology.... but thanks lol   Hands down great food though!!",

I wasn't as impressed as others seem to be but I hope to give it another chance because the environment was really chill and inviting, the deco and seating was very cute - the service and food wasn't satisfying for me.   My friends and I came in for brunch - ordered coffee and breakfast items. They were busy and nearly packed so I didn't mind the extra time it took to get our food. I ordered the bacon stuffed pancakes which were huge - enough for 2-3 people in my opinion - however, they really weren't what I expected. It looked and tasted like they put imitation bacon bits inside of them - I expected larger pieces and more flavor. I don't know if I was being unrealistic but I could barely taste the bacon and it just tasted like plain pancakes that I could barely eat 1/4 of. We also ordered the appetizer pretzel that came with a mustard dip - however they burnt it, we sent it back and they came back out with another burnt pretzel. They did not charge us for it but it was sort of a bummer. The staff is very customer focused though - we wanted to watch the soccer game and they put it on and pointed a TV towards us as well as apologized for some issues in our service.   I hope to update my review when I go back and try something different!",

I mean that good.  My daughter was impressed with them and so was I.  I wasn't in the mood for breakfast so I opted for the sausage and parmigiana stuffed cubinella peppers.  Holy moly these were excellent!  I didn't know where to start and end but let me tell you delicious.  Items like this on the menu make it hard to choose between breakfast and dinner!  Good job!",

    "text": "For what you pay: borderline 2 money signs $$~~~~.   Ambiance: Cool modern vibes  Service: great! Taste: Yummy  Bakn is a yummy brunch/breakfast place that puts an interesting twist on breakfast items.  I have never seen choices like this!  There is a cool, exposed ductwork modern feel that can easily turn sporty on a game day.  Most tables are adjoined to a wall long booth with chairs across from the booth seats.  One large community table near the first bar.  Other tables in the back near the second bar.    We came on a Steelers game day, and despite there being no Pittsburgh paraphernalia, it looked like a modern sports bar. It was packed full of fans! Despite significant fandom, we retained our hunger and the savory smells incentivized us to take a look around the room at other peoples food.  Permit me to give you a quick tour of the interesting foods here.   Exhibit A- Bakn Cakes:  Fluffy pancakes containing cooked bacon covered with maple syrup! Exhibit B- Chicken Cakes: Pancakes with crispy fried chicken covered in maple syrup.  Albeit, these two choices are both around 16$ and you may not find them to be worth the expenditure.  Admittedly, the ladder is more of a twist on chicken and waffles.  To be fair, I did not try any of these due to my dietary restrictions but I found it to be a beautiful presentation . The pancakes looked huge!  They took up the entire plate.   My table had the Reuben, a simple 2 eggs, and toast and lastly the vegetarian burger with a side of potatoes.  Let me just say the potatoes are delicious.  Good potatoes can sometimes make a place.  Though these potatoes don't quite subscribe to the potato hall of fame, they still are delectable. The vegetarian burger was delightedly more like a vegetarian sandwich: zucchini and onion medley on toasted bread. All was very good.  Thankful for the vegetarian/vegan shoutout on a menu that screams BACON every other option!  Mimosa's were 8$.  Coffee 2.50. Bathrooms in the back.",

    "text": "Initially came here on a Friday morning for brunch. Our waitress Debbie was amazing! She highlighted menu options and gave suggestions for us \"out of towners.\" We even asked about paying for parking and she gave us some quarters for the meter.   I ended up getting the buttermilk pancakes and a flight of bakn. I loved the pancakes and the warm syrup complemented the dish very well. I normally don't like powdered sugar on my breakfast items but this didn't bother me in the slightest. The bacon flight was very flavorful and worth trying; they give you 6 decent sized pieces. The brunch punch was also good. It paired well with the bakn flight appetizer.   I also came today. Our waitress Michelle was just okay. Once we sat down, she immediately came over and asked what did we want to eat. No offer of suggestions, time to look once the menu, or a welcoming smile. She only checked on us at the very end; I only saw her as we were ordering and when we finished. I got the buttermilk pancakes again; excellent! The candied bacon was even better than I remembered. Just the right amount of sweet. I tried the home fries which were okay with ketchup. They are deep fried as opposed to being sauteed on the stovetop. Mimosa was great.  Overall great experiences! The food was phenomenal on both occasions. I recognize that Michelle may not have been as friendly due to the busy crowd. Would definitely come here again if I were in Pittsburgh!",

I highly recommend you start the meal off right with a bacon sampler... that's right you can order a bacon sampler (It's as delicious as it sounds).  I live about thirty minutes away so this is not a convenient location for me, but it is definitely worth the drive. I'm so excited to take my friends and family when they come visit from Philadelphia.  The staff is top notch, we had a fantastic server who made some great food and drink recommendations. They were very flexible and customized my order.   I wish I didn't have to drive because the bar is superb. I would LOVE to come here for drinks, they had great local spirits and a wide variety of whiskey to compliment the delicious meat. The person tending bar was skilled and precise, the cocktails looked fantastic.   I could probably write a book on how tasty the Sriracha Bacon was. I'm not even a huge Sriracha fan, but this was the standout bacon for me. There is simply nothing else like this ANYWHERE.  It was mouthwatering & had the perfect blend of spices and sauce.  My girlfriend and I both ordered breakfast foods, but the sandwiches looked delicious and portions are very large. The meal was very reasonably priced, tasted great, and left me feeling satisfied!   Hats off to the entire staff you guys rock.",

We started with the biscuits and bacon jam and ordered two Bakn favorites, the pancake tacos and breakfast sandwich #1. The only reason for 4 stars was even with using the Nowait app, we had to wait over an hour and a half after checking in at the restaurant. The food was worth it, but make sure you have the time and are willing to wait.",

Bakn is truly a bacon sensation, but no worries...there's a plethora of non-swine (and even vegetarian) options to ponder. Their basic breakfast sandwich #1 comes with a substantial side o' delicately rosemary seasoned, roasted home fries - much appreciated in a city full of under seasoned breakfast potatoes! And then there was bacon. The bakn flight was tempting, but one can get the same effect via the 'bakn bakn bakn' omelet; cooked to perfection and filled with the applewood smoked, cajun and peppered varieties + mozzarella cheese to boot. But the True wizardry is in the bak'n slapped honey jam that I ordered on the side for the toast! It's magical and simply a must try. This Carnegie destination deserves several visits, but brunch was heavenly.",

I'm sad to report that I have to give Bakn 3 stars because I wasn't wowed (and because 3.5 doesn't exist). I will say right now that it is a cute little place in Carnegie, and I will def come again.  The menu wasn't overwhelming, but it was kind of hard for me to figure out what was going on, and that might have been just me. I decided to get the chicken and cakes, which was their version of chicken and waffles. I liked it, and it may have been mental, but I prefer waffles to pancakes with my chicken. My bacon to pancake ratio was a little light, but I think that is a gentle balance that needs to be decided by powers higher than me. Like bacon God's or something. All in all, this was a decent experience, but it was kind of hyped up for me, and it didn't deliver to the full expectation.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Bakn yesterday and had a terrible experience. First, the woman seating people (who turned out to be the manager) attempted to seat my husband, our 6-month-old, and me at a tall cafe table intended for 2 people. While my daughter would be sitting on our laps, this tiny table left no room for us to move plates away from her or anywhere to set the diaper bag. I was met with attitude when I asked for a regular table. When we were seated at a normal table, our waitress took our order. I got a BLT with fries and my husband got a bacon omelette with fruit salad. Over 25 minutes later, our food still hadn't arrived.   A young man who was cleaning tables must've noticed my face and came over to ask if we needed anything; we explained that our food was taking forever. He said it was very busy and that things were not going well; he said that the owner is normally very involved but that he was away at this time. He said we could contact the owner with our concerns. He promised to get our waitress and to do what he could. It would turn out that this was the best customer service we'd receive.  Our waitress came over several minutes later and asked what the problem was. We again told her that our food was taking exceptionally long. She then asked us what she was supposed to do about it. She told us it was very busy. When I again expressed my frustration, she told us yelling at her wasn't going to do any good.  Then the manager came over. She told us to look around; it was clearly very busy. I told her I'd been in busy restaurants before; was I supposed to be impressed? She then repeated that they were busy and asked what she was supposed to do about it. I explained that the table next to us had received their food, eaten it, placed a to go order, received that, and paid, all while we were waiting for our food - over 30 minutes at that point. She raised her voice at me, again asking what I wanted her to do about it. I told her I'd be contacting the owner as well as posting an honest review on Yelp. She then informed me I was \"being mean\" and stormed off. I sat there in disbelief for a moment, then began gathering up my daughter's belongings with the intention of leaving. As I was standing up, our waitress walked over with two plates and snarkily asked \"Do you even still want these?\"   Well, it had been 35 minutes, and we were hungry. So we sat down and ate. The food was alright - certainly not worth the long wait that we had. The fruit salad was just pineapple and grapes, and the BLT (which was supposed to have special bacon mayo of some kind) just had plain mayo.  At some point during our meal, the waitress and manager both came over to tell us our bill had been taken care of and not to worry about it. We did not leave a tip.  The best (sarcasm) part was after I took the baby out to the car to feed her. The manager/hostess made an incredibly rude remark to my husband about me.   I will not go back. Comedically bad service plus mediocre food? No thanks.",

I think that they might have cooked the avocado toast before the other dishes? The flavor of the avocado toast was good, but my egg was undercooked (raw egg white). Shrimp n Mac, the shrimp had great flavor, but the Mac was flavorless. Overall, we were super disappointed. This place had 4 stars and the food and service were both disappointing.",

When going for Sunday brunch, we used the No Wait app in order to get our names in with minimal wait.  Unfortunately it was not very accurate.  We were told that it would be another 30 min.  Ugh!  Okay... we'll wait.  When seated at a high top table, I thought it was just me, but everyone said their seats were uncomfortable.  Our server was nice and very busy.  He took our drink order: a Bakn bloody mary, a bellini and a mimosa... and a soda.  They were pricey and a little disappointing... my mimosa was a screwdriver with extra OJ.   For meals- some chose breakfast and others lunch.  A Reuben that was just okay and Bakn pancakes that I LOVED!  It was a mixed bag for us.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong items... except the pancakes!   Try them!  The check was too pricey, in my opinion.   Next time we'll omit the cocktails... there will be a next time though!

I was worried they might be a bit too sweet, but this may be my new favorite menu item. The pancakes are not heavy at all, they are light and airy and perfect. The bananas were cooked into the pancakes and the nutella sauce was served on the side so these can be as indulgent as you'd like. Definitely a must-try on your next visit!  I've also had the braised short ribs, the salmon and the burger. All were great! On a recent visit they promoted that they are having nightly specials - my favorite being wine and swine Wednesday! They also started a Sunday dinner series that I certainly want to try!",

We came for an early Sunday breakfast with some friends---including a 1-year-old---and everyone left happy. I got the pancakes without bacon stuffing. They forgot not to sprinkle my pancakes with more bacon on top, but getting it off wasn't too bad. If that makes you squirm, you might want to make it explicitly clear to the waitress that you really don't want bacon in or on your dish. Tried a biscuit, too, and was very pleasantly surprised with how good it was!   Other people enjoyed the actually bacon-stuffed pancakes and the chicken and waffles. Hot sauce available!   They had high-chairs and were very accommodating to the presence of our friends' child! Other kids were there, too. Definitely a kid-friendly place.",

The bacon itself was very flavorful, especially the peppered bacon.  It was lively at 9 AM on a Sunday but we got a seat right away (after hearing from someone they had been unsuccessful in getting a table multiple times - if that's still the case, the key is to go early or get the NoWait app to be put on the wait list).  However, the service was surprisingly poor.  Our waitress was all over the place (at one point she was behind the bar, making us think she was the bartender).  She failed to bring any butter or spread with the toast for my mom's breakfast (despite asking for it) and we struggled to signal a server for help.  The table next to us had a different server and seemed to receive more attention.  In fact, our coffee was served by that server and not the one who served us the rest of the meal.  I'd go back but I would hope to have a better experience service wise.",

My favorite so far of the bunch is Bak'n. After throwing our names in on NoWait (already a bonus!), my mom and I made the quick drive down from Cubbage Hill and they had a table ready for us within minutes. I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich #1, which was a combination of bacon, egg, cheese, tomato, and greens. Sounds standard, right? Not so at Bak'n. The bacon was chewy, thick-cut perfection that stood up well to the thin layer of fried egg in the middle and the creamy Jarlsberg cheese the warm egg was just starting to melt. The greens: fresh, peppery arugula. My favorite parts of the sandwich, though: 1) the fact that the tomato was oven-roasted, as opposed to your standard raw slice of tomato (which, in January, you know is going to be subpar), and 2) the generous (but not to the point of overpowering) slather of Bak'naise that tied the whole sandwich together. I could barely touch my side of home fries, which were flavored with rosemary--I did manage to get through the extra-crispy bits, though :) Thanks, Bak'n--way to bring one home for Carnegie!",

The service sucked, once seated we waited 15 min before our waitress came. When she did, she asked what we wanted to order...I don't know maybe a drink!? My Bloody Mary and PEPSI took another 10 minutes. The Bloody Mary was just full of horseradish and nothing else and I LOVE horseradish so come on. The menu looked amazing but no. We got the Reuben and pork belly tacos BOTH dishes were a joke. The pork belly tasted like day old pork chops and the best way I could explain my boring Reuben was that it tasted \"like the color white\". But that's not the worst folks, the clowns showing off and acting like morons in the open kitchen were a disgrace to the industry. I'm not sure what everyone was waiting for but don't waste any of your time doing so.",

It's typically our go-to type of dining establishment and there are a ton of great ones in the area. When going somewhere new, I typically ask the server what they enjoy best or would recommend. Our server was surprisingly disinterested when I asked about the shrimp and grits and I found that to be quite off-putting. That led me to get the bacon burger and my wife had the cheddar burger. Both were overcooked and under-seasoned. My burger had a slight amount of bacon on it, but it was not particularly unique or flavorful, which one would expect from a restaurant bearing its name. I would rate the overall quality of our meals as being on par with anything you can get at a typical large-chain restaurant. It could be that we ordered the wrong things. The breakfast options looked and smelled great. If we do go back, we definitely won't be having burgers. Also, I was quite surprised at the lack of unique on-tap beers. In general, if you're looking for a place to have a good sandwich and a few beers, there are a ton of better options (Burgatory, Fat Head's, Industry Public House, The Yard, just to name a few).",

Sure the place looks nice, the graphic design of the menu makes it seem like you're about to have an incredible treat, and the bar looked alluring. But the first thing you notice when you walk in this place, is that it doesn't smell like bacon. Considering the name of the place, and the obvious allure for bacon lovers, you'd expect a bacon restaurant would smell like bacon. And when the bacon laden items we ordered - 1 pound bacon sandwich, a breakfast sandwich, and almond French toast - came, we couldn't decipher the flavor of the applewood bacon from the pepper bacon...that was sort of weird. As for the French toast, my girlfriend had to sprinkle a sugar packet from the table onto the surprisingly small slices just to get some flavor of sweet. (The less then maple tasting maple syrup didn't help.) And that's the thing we noticed overall, most of the things we had lacked flavor. For example, the hashbrowns were soggy and tasteless. And my girlfriend's coleslaw had no mayo or flavor to it. It was fresh, but tasted like shredded cabbage with a few cranberry pieces thrown in. Needless to say, we will not be rushing to return or bothering to recommend this restaurant. And as for the prices, yes, just as others have said, inflated.",

I was hesitant about the stuffed peppers because of the egg, but it works!  It just works with it and it's amazing.  The BLT is an absolute ridiculous amount of bacon... and I wouldn't change one thing about it.  The signature Bakn Martini is to die for.  It's a good stiff drink that's a little sweet, a little smokey, a little tart.  The first sip I took just tasted like Autumn.  It tasted like I should've had on Ugg boots, black leggings and a flannel while sitting in front of a roaring firepit. I liked everything about the Bakn Burger....except the actual burger.  It needs some attention.  I felt it (the burger itself) was very plain and equally dry.  Like all the good stuff was pressed out of it on the grill.   If not for the bacon on it, it wouldn't have much flavor at all.  Why not put bacon IN the burger.   I also thought it had too much of the greens on it.  Cut down on the greens (or use spinach or something).  Add a kicky mayo.  Maybe sliced avocados as an option.  Just a thought.   I love the whole concept of Bakn.  It's definitely a welcome change in Carnegie.  It's clean, bright, beautiful and simple.  The staff is coming along and getting in to their groove.  I expect that Bakn is going to be another Carnegie icon like Papa's and The Pour House.  Keep doing what you're doing!",

Wait time from ordering your food to when it finally comes was a little longer than expected as well, but we were compensated with an order of free bisquits. Definitely going back and hoping that they have more people working next time.",

Went with the bakn-bakn-bakn omelette and was delighted.  Mozzarella gave it the cheesy texture but stayed in the background and let the bacon show off.  No wait when I went, but I could see parking being a little intimidating for a non-local.  Service was quick and pleasant.",

    "text": "My visit here had me sitting at the bar during a busy weekday lunch period.  I like the location in the revitalizing downtown of this rugged old place (Honus Wagner's home town--some nice history up the street).  The decor is very urban hipster, with concrete floors and lots of corrugated metal.  The space is well-lit by the storefront windows, and the hard surfaces make it a bit noisy at times.  The bar has TVs.  I found the food outstanding.  My bacon flight was really delicious.  I had planned on taking some with for later-HA.  I ate it all.  By myself.  I tried the shrimp and grits (with bacon), and for Northerners, they did a very nice job.  The restroom was very clean and spacious, with cool decor to match the vibe of the joint.  My server was the bartender, and he was good.  They have a nifty orange juicing machine that you can watch if you are seated at the bar.  Fun.  Although my service experience was great, I watched two interesting situations.  I was drinking coffee, and had a steaming hot cup in front of me, when the patron to my left complained that his was cold, even though freshly poured.  The interesting thing was watching the staff respond to this--almost a New York attitude, I must say.  It turns out there was a cold and old pot lurking around the back, and his must have been filled from this.  An honest slip up.   In my book, this sort of thing should be fixed quickly with a smile, no challenging or questioning the patron.  Just get him a new cup of coffee!!  Later in my visit, the patron on my other side had waited forever for his burger.  He had to get back to work, and was very concerned about time.  It was the end of the lunch rush, and maybe the kitchen was backed up.  The manager helped him out financially, but in my mind should have comped the whole meal.  The burger was enjoyed when it came, but for the price, he should have had more time to eat it.  (In my book, anything more than 20 minutes from order to table is excessive, and this was beyond that.)  It was observing these events that kept me from giving this place five stars.  The food I ate was five star.  But the rest of the business was not quite at that level.",

However, the menu and service isn't what you'd hope for.  I've had breakfast, lunch, brunch and the same every time.  First off, the prices are too high.  Last trip a basic breakfast (eggs, potatoes) and a pork belly taco lunch with drinks cost $55.  The prices are just too high for the quality.  We got pork belly tacos at the urging of the waitress.  However, the pork belly was nearly all fat on every taco.  Out of 3, we only ate 1 and part of the 2nd.  Didn't even touch the 3rd.  The waitress asked if it was ok, we said it was all fat.  She said, \"sorry\" and took the full plate.  I guess she wasn't concerned.  I had the basic breakfast and it was just ok.  Nothing worth the high cost.  The potatoes were bland so those were a waste.  The waitress dropped my toast on the way over.  Again, she said sorry and took the toast away, but never brought more.  Weird?  The bloody mary's were a disappointment.  I was looking forward to the bakn bloody but again, like everything else, underwhelmed me.  The lone bright spot was the Beermosa.  Every time I've had one, they've been delicious.  However the overprice on the food and the underwhelming food leaves a lot to be desired.  It's a shame, a lot of potential here.",

    "text": "This restaurant had me at the word \"Bakn\", and I'm not someone who has a love affair with the food item.  Price: The most expensive options on the menu were the Short Braised Ribs and the Pan Seared Shrimp and Grits for $13 each.  What I Ordered: The \"Bakn, Bakn, Bakn\" Omelete for $10. My wife ordered the Bakn' Stuffed Cakes for $9.50. We also split an appetizer called the Bakn Flight for $8 (featured one piece of all 6 types of bacon they offer). My omelet was hearty, basically a calzone of mozzarella and bacon with eggs packing it all in instead of bread. This was a good thing. The Bakn' Stuffed Cakes were perfection, with the bacon pieces perfectly included in the batter of the cakes. You don't need syrup.  Portion Size: Significant! I'm the kind of person who wants to leave a restaurant feeling full, and if I need to take a box home, even better. I forced myself to finish my omelete because it would have been unforgivable not to.   Variety: Don't let the name full you, there's a good number of non-bacon food options here. Salads, sandwiches, flatbreads, omelets, a few meat options and pancakes round out the menu.  Wait Time: We were served right away, but we showed up at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning. A line quickly formed at around 10 AM, and I've had people tell me they've waited 30 minutes at some points.  Solo, Group, or Couple?: There's a bar to sit at for a quick drink, smaller tables for couples, and large tables for groups. A \"Meet-Up\" was actually taking places while we were there. Looked like they had a party of 12.  Location/Parking: On-street parking on the main street of Carnegie. Not ideal, but there is a paid parking lot a few blocks away if you're not against a 5 minute walk.  Serve Booze?: Yes. Mimosas, Bloody Marys, craft beers.  Atmosphere: Combination of rustic and industrial. The music was excellent, with some guests bobbing their heads to Queen and the Rolling Stones.  Verdict: Patrons should be arrested for eating this food. All items should be placed under glass and praised. Place this food stuff on display in a museum next to the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage will steal it in National Treasure 4. Ron Swanson, if he were as real as I like to pretend he is, would relocate his office to Bakn.",

My wife and I also tried the biscuits with bacon jam. Jam was good, but the biscuits fell apart like they were made of sand. However, we came back to give it a second chance. I had the bacon pancakes cuz that sounds awesome. But, again, the pancakes fell apart like sand too and I like my pancakes to have a slight crisp when I bite into them. Not these cakes, it was almost like the flat top was not hot enough. I feel the cooks either overcook or undercook food here, which makes me mad, cuz the both times we were there, the head chef, in his white costume, was not in the kitchen the entire time we were there. He was shaking hands the first time and then eating the second time. The dude is entitled to eat, but we were there during Sunday brunch. Sunday brunch at a restaurant whose name is the most popular brunch protein ever invented... So um... Get in the effing kitchen, man, or at least eat in the back. Needless to say, this place is trying to look the part, but falls short food wise.",

Service has always been very solid as well. When I went with my mom and aunt, who are notorious for always splitting things wherever we go, they actually brought out each half on separate plates which I thought was sweet of them. It may not seem like a big thing, but it was nice and we appreciated it!  My one issue is that it's kind of expensive for what it is. I think they are going for the upscale brunch vibe, but the prices are even higher than some of my favorite brunch spots downtown. It's definitely good, and if I'm in the area I would continue to stop by for brunch!",

It was incredible! There was applewood, BBQ, candied, peppered, cajun and one we can't remember. Our top favorite was the candied.   I got the chicken & cakes which was bacon stuffed pancakes with boneless chicken breasts. It was so delicious! The portions are so filling, I took half of mine home.   My husband got the Pig Pen Burger: burger, cheeses, bacon, pork belly, egg, tomato, arugula. He loved it and said it was so flavorful! The side of fries he got were even amazing.

It's got a piece of bacon as you could imagine.  The Bakn flight was a total letdown as well.  There are so many interesting ways to showcase and show off the versatility of it bacon, but what comes out is basically a plate of 6 strips of bacon, all cooked exactly the same, but with 3 of them having a different flavor dusted or wiped on.  Maybe one was applewood smoked and the others were cherry....it's seriously just a plate of bacon though.  Snore.  The shrimp and grits were also a let down.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly in some sort of cajun or old bay mixture and they were indeed quite tasty and large.  Unfortunately they lay atop a pile of the most bland grits I've ever had.  They were supposed to be cheddar grits but they were more like boxed instant grits.  There were a few bacon crumbles and some scallions and tomatoes.  Nothing went together to blend the dish at all.  The scallions and tomatoes did have a great flavor and tried to make it a cohesive dish, but it really fell apart.  I didn't personally get a chance to taste the avocado toast, my fiance did and said they were like little eggs Benedict with avocado instead of ham.  She said they were indeed very good.  Everyone at the table did seem to find the toast to be the best part of all the meals.  All in all, it's just a little diner in Carnegie with a few different menu items and overpriced cocktails.    If Bakn was wearing a 'Diners' clothes and not pretending to be a high end brunch spot, it would have gotten a 4 because it is a decent little diner.  Fancy brunch, they take home the 2.

But the food is very disappointing. The first time my husband and I went, he got a grilled chicken sandwich and I got the breakfast sandwich #1 (recommended by the waitress). We also shared the bacon jam and biscuits. My husband's chicken sandwich, the chicken was burnt to a crisp so all you could taste was char. My breakfast sandwich was ok, better than the chicken sandwich. But it was so incredibly greasy. The bacon jam was pretty tasty but it just didn't go well with the biscuits, considering the biscuits were crumbly and dry. They were more like scones than biscuits.   We gave Bakn a second chance and ordered the bacon stuffed pancakes and an eggs breakfast. The pancakes, what a nightmare. They were so crumbly and dry. And the eggs breakfast, there's not much you can screw up but Bakn managed to cook the home fries to the point they were chewy and inedible.   All in all, the menu looks and sounds amazing, but certainly does not taste so great.",

    "text": "I went here with my wife and another couple on a Tuesday night.  I had heard great reviews about Bakn and the couple we wanted to meet up with lived close by Carnegie; so we decided to make a quick trip here to meet up for dinner.  We arrived around 7 PM and it was surprisingly fairly empty.  The place is decorated uniquely with a few pig paintings that are just above my level of artistic ability, a neon light of a pig, and some coat hooks in the shape of pig tails.  They had seating at tables, a bar, and in front of the open kitchen which was definitely different from anything I've ever seen.    The menu contained some absolutely amazing choices!  For an appetizer, my wife and I split a flight of bacon which included 6 different flavors of bacon.  Our two favorites were the cajun and sriracha.  They also had candied, pepper, regular, and apple wood bacon as well.  Our friends ordered the same and agreed that cajun was incredible! My wife ordered the chicken sandwich while I had the bacon blue burger.  Needless to say the portion size was very generous.   and I had fresh cut fries with my burger.  The arugula and red onion marmalade really set this sandwich apart from your traditional blue cheese bacon burger.  It is well worth a taste if you enjoy the bacon + blue cheese + burger combination!  This is a very unique place in Carnegie.  Interestingly decorated with a hipster feel and some unbeatable cuts and pairings of bacon.  Although we did not try their drink menu, it looked exceptionally interesting.  I believe they are opening a second location in Wexford which will be within a few miles of our house.  Cannot wait!",

They grow fresh herbs on their rooftop which adds that special touch of extreme freshness. All the drinks are made with freshly squeezed juices. The Bakn Martini is my absolute favorite - bacon infused vodka, butterscotch schnapps and apple juice - sounds odd but it's great if you like drinks on the sweet side. Word of advice, don't attempt to go without a reservation especially on Sundays for breakfast or brunch because it's typically an hour wait.",

    "text": "Dang, Bakn, you came out in full force last night. What a wonderful time Chris and I had eating and drinking out in Carnegie. I was really impressed by the adorable pig decor and the food was out of this world. Chris and I usually do not agree on a lot but this place was all thumbs up for us. I would say that while it is not in walking distance or as close to home as we usually venture, this place was a treat. Totally worth the time, uber, or lyft to try out something new outside of the city.   Tasty Treats: Pork Belly Tacos: Pan seared pork belly, tangy coleslaw, pickled red onion, pineapple ailoli: Ok, I will get two complaints out of the way quickly. I am a tortilla snob and would have liked a corn tortilla instead of a flour one. Chris liked the flour but he isn't as snobbish as I am. I also wished there were more red onions. But the flavor was on point. Smoky goodness and not hard to chew at all. I liked the tangy coleslaw but really didn't taste much of the aioli. I would get this again for sure.  Scratch buttermilk and pumpkin biscuits with bakn slapped honey jam: The biscuits were fluffy and moist. Biscuits can go so wrong sometimes that these were a real treat. I liked that the pumpkin was not overwhelming. But that bakn honey jam was no joke. It was more bakn than honey but still, the flavor was so good! I would have never have thought that would have been a good thing to spread on a biscuit and boy was I wrong!  Grilled Cheese: French Onion: Interesting, but eh. I would rather eat my french onion as a soup than in a grilled cheese. Apricot & Cheddar: Good! I liked the sweetness of it. But I doubt I would pick this again. Cheddar, Jarisberg, Pesto, Oven-Roasted Tomato: My favorite of all three. This was awesome. I would eat this combo every day of the week. The tomato was seasoned before it was roasted so the flavors melded together so well. YUM.  Bakn, Bakn, Bakn, flat bread: Applewood, peppered, cajun bakn, mozzarella, provolone, tomato, dressed arugula: I thought that this was good. Not my number one of the night but still good. The flat bread was nice and crispy but some of the pieces didn't have much of the bakn on it and with three different flavors of bakn you would think it would have a lot!  Graceland Grill: Candied bakn, banan, peanut butter, on grilled country bread: YES, YES, YES, YES, YES. I loved this. Peanut butter and banana THEN YOU MIX BACON INTO IT! Awesome. I would have eaten six pieces of this. Yummy!  Salted Caramel Cheesecake: No words for how delish this was. Get it, don't think about it, just do it.   From the bar: Tito's Fountain of Youth: Refreshing and not sweet at all. Surprisingly strong for a small drink!  Shiner Bock Draft: Beer! Yum! Refreshing!",

Both were very tasty. My husband had the French toast and he said it was better then Pamela's. our friends had eggs and a grilled veggie sandwich. They both enjoyed their meal.

    "text": "I have something to admit... I'm not obsessed with bacon like everyone else is. There, I said it. But... I do love Bakn!   The Cheddar Burger is probably one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. The meat in the patty is excellent quality, cooked perfectly. The other thing I love about Bakn is how fresh everything is. Even down to the arugula dressed on the burger. Speaking of arugula, their salads are also great. They have this house made lemon dressing that's killer. I've had both the salmon salad and salmon quinoa and again, fresh and tasty.  If I were to have my perfect meal here I'd get the burger and then the salted caramel cheesecake. Dear lord that thing is good. It comes in a huge mason jar and definitely needs to be shared! It's delicious at every layer. The whipped cream, the caramel, the cheesecake and then the homemade graham cracker crust. Hmmmmmmmm.   Recounting how many great meals I had here makes me realize I've visited quite a bit! I only had one miss, which was the pork belly reuben. The pork was pretty tough, so it was hard to chew through the whole sandwich. But everything else is so great, it was probably an off day.   Wait, can I add the bloody mary too? Because theirs is the perfect mix of spice. So maybe you'll just have to go back a couple times! Rest assured, if you love the bacon, you'll love it and if you don't, you'll be just fine!",

    "text": "If you have a bacon addiction, this restaurant is for you.  We came here fairly early and we had nearly the whole place to ourselves. It is a vibrant, open, and pork-tastic focused place.  Yes, I made that word up but between the decor (pigs are flying here... or at least above your head) and the vast menu of all things bacon, it seems to be fitting.  There is a lot of things on the menu... things that you may have not even dreamed in your deepest darkest carnivore dreams (pancakes filled with real bacon pieces AND bacon on top??).  YET there are more than one dish that will give a vegan a happy dish to munch and nibble on rabbit style.  I'm normally a vegetarian but certain needs need to be met and bacon & french toast was one of them.  There was no negotiation once the menu was known.  So upon our early day arrival, the smiling and pleasant waitress let us have our pick of a table and ready to pour our first cup of coffee.  She was really convincing on how good and unique their bacon focused dishes were.  I mean we could have ordered a simple cheese omelette, a chocolate chip pancake, or grilled cheese.  She recommend we pig out (ha... yea I know, you can eye roll that one) and order the Bakn Cake Tacos.  We also had to order the bacon flight (6 types of bacon) and an order of the almond crusted french toast. Great thing about this place... they delivered all the dishes quickly and they were piping hot from the kitchen.    Bacon Flight - 6 strips of different flavoured bacon for $10.  Definitely on the pricier side but who can resist a plate of bacon.  They had Smoked Applewood, Sriracha, BBQ, Cajun, Pepper, and Candied.  They all were distinctive flavours and I have to admit, some of them were very good.  I especially liked the smoked applewood as there was a definite smokey flavour and it was nice and crisp.  The Cajun was also another interesting and good bacon as it has a lot of bold spiced that complimented the bacon well.  4/5  Almond Crusted French Toast - A solid rendition of a flavourful and well done french toast.  The dish came with a generous serving of 4 fairly large slices with a lot of sliced almonds on all sides.  The custard went mostly all the way through and provided that nice and soft interior to a more crispier edge.  It did come with a bit of whip cream but between the syrup, sweet custardy interior, and powdered sugar, the whip cream was overboard.  Though ... not anywhere close to being crazy as the Bakn Cake Tacos.  4/5  Bakn Cake Tacos - The sweet waitress convinced me that this was the one to get.  Dear lawd ... what did I order?  Call me surprised when this huge platter graced the table... maybe grace is the wrong word... hogged (I know I know) the table area in front of me.  Three incredibly big pancakes infused with tons of bacon pieces was the 'taco shell' and inside the taco was MORE bacon (at least 2 slices PER taco), a whole fried egg in each taco, AND cheese.  Whaaa? Oh sure, and some pieces of green leaves to make you think its healthy.  Honestly, I was shocked at the size.  I could eat one and a bit ... it was bacon overload.  Aside from the generous portion, the flavour was good!  Adding a drizzle of the syrup made it a great sweet savoury combo.  I'm not sure if I would order it again unless I have someone to share it with... can't go hog wild on that much food!  4/5  Bakn is a solid restaurant with very good service in a nice rustic and modern space.  Definitely come to try some unique dishes that are done very well.  Trust me you won't be Boar'd with the menu... as you would with my terrible puns!",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place after attending a recent yelp event where I was able to try their bacon bloody mary and their bacon jam. Both of which were delicious. So naturally when one of my bacon loving best friends had a birthday we decided to check out Bakn.   We started our meal with the grilled cheese flight which included blue cheese and fig, grilled onions and cheese, and the basic one off menu. Honestly this was probably the best part of our meal. I thought all of the flavor combinations were very interesting and paired nicely together. The next best thing was probably the bacon bloody marys. As for my meal itself I got the pork belly tacos and I'm not sure how else to put this other than they were absolutely terrible. The pork had so much fat and the only thing that had any flavor was the cole slaw which was just basic cole slaw.   All in all this is one place I probably won't ever give another chance which I don't say often. I usually am willing to return and give most places another shot. While the grilled cheese and bloody mary's were delicious they are both something I can easily get elsewhere or even make myself.",

Ordered food:  bakn pancakes, bakn omlette,  salmon frittatta, Bleu cheese burger.  We reminded server we did not yet have the latte or water, ordered 2nd Stella.  Food good but NOT memorable. Portions are HUGE!  Prices reasonable especially considering portion size.  We were not charged for the burger, blueberry pancakes or the 2nd Stella (3/4 bottle sent back. beer & a burger good, beer & blueberry pancakes... no. )   Place is very clean,  noise level low for early afternoon.  Water is terrible, reeks of chlorine. Suggest making a reservation, checking with server about portion size, consider sharing.",

It took a while for anyone to come help us, and the table next to us had been waiting even longer without service. The customers next to us were noticeably annoyed, and complaining loudly about the wait. Not the best way to start off!   When we ordered, I asked for no cheese on my meal (I'm lactose intolerant). The food came out with cheese, and when I reminded the waitress, she asked if it could be scraped off. As the cheese had melted, I had to say no. It was awkward.   When the correct order finally came out, I enjoyed some of the bacon dishes. Others were a bit hit and miss--for example, I had the \"famous bakn pancakes\" which were okay. The BLT however, was great, and the real winner of the dinner were the biscuits and the bacon jam.   I will potentially be back if I'm in the area to pick up some bacon jam!",

Matt got the pig pen burger and I had the Fresh Berry Pancakes (no bacon) He really enjoyed his burger, which had pork belly, bacon, and an egg on it. I loved my pancakes because well, no bacon.

I've been here for weekend brunch and weekend dinner. Most memorable experience would be when a group of 10 of us (including 3 small kiddos) came by for dinner - we were seated very quickly and the children were accommodated. The menu is diverse enough that anyone can find something they enjoy - many of us tried out the bacon-y menu items, but we also had a few non-bacon eaters, vegetarian, and vegan people in our party, not to mention slightly picky toddlers :) We started off with a bacon flight - which came with several types of bacon - all delicious. Many people got burgers which were all made very well, while I personally got the bacon pancakes (omg). One friend ordered the BLT which had a VERY generous bacon portion - no complaints there! They were not short on options for vegetarians (amazing looking and well received grilled cheese) and vegans (veggie sandwich looked great, as did their many salads). The little ones also enjoyed their apple pie pancakes!  The staff itself was very friendly - I'm sure we were one of the more demanding tables there - but everyone was all smiles and well fed. I've enjoyed every visit here and look forward to many more!",

Going for the experience and being ok with taking longer I was ready for the bacon and good conversation. After putting in a reservation on the no-wait app, we still had to wait, but enjoyed a drink at the bar (luckily there were enough bar-seats for us) then made our way to the table.  We got a bacon sampler (6 different kinds of bacon)... delicious, but you have to be ready for the price tag I think it was $10. Fun to do this time, probably won't spring for it again. My favorite was the pepper bacon, but siracha was up there too!  Meals around the table included the pork belly tacos (YUM!), the #1 breakfast sandwich (sooo good!), chicken and cakes (seriously, the chicken was delicious!!), a flat bread (good flavor, but was pale in comparison to the other items) and a salad (let's be honest, I didn't try that because everything else was soooo good!). The bloody mary's and mimosas were all enjoyed at the table.  So, plan for a morning adventure, go with good company, and enjoy the bacon!  I should also mention that the first time we were introduced to Bak'n was at the Yelp! Swing into Summer event in June - the bacon jelly and the bloody mary samples had us all excited to go try this place out -- and it's nice to see something come up in Carnegie for a few minutes outside of the city.",

I'm eating breakfast here, this isn't a child's birthday party...I don't need an extra 400 calories of sugar dumped on top of my breakfast, I'm an adult.  The butter on the pancakes was frozen and wouldn't melt.  Pancakes are rubbery, almost like giant McDonald's pancakes but with less flavor.  These are some of the worst pancakes in town which is why they feel the need to smother them in so much stuff, because the plain pancake are flavorless and rubbery. The home fries are deep fried, they have a great seasoning but were under fried and turned to mush as soon as you forked them.  Also, $4 is pretty typical for fresh juice but the 8 oz portion size is ridiculous.  In general this place is fairly mediocre but people from this city are so simple that you can take food like this and stick it on a square plate and yinzers will think it's fancy.",

The BLT was piled high with crispy bacon and the burgers were moist, cooked to order and yummy. The service was great and as always, Randy Tozzi, the chef/owner was checking in with customers to make sure everything was satisfactory. I've been to BAKN several times and would happily go more often if the food had no calories! Delicious!",

    "text": "Not impressed.   Service: Arrived Saturday morning around 10 a.m. We were told that it would be a 30-45 minute wait so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Well, it took about 15 minutes to actually get a drink (no exaggeration). Three bartenders, two of which walked around aimlessly not paying attention to anyone at the bar until finally, we interrupted one them and asked if we could order a drink.   The hostess was very polite, but she said that she couldn't seat us (even though there were plenty of open tables) because the kitchen was backed up and it would be 45 minutes to get food. We awkwardly hovered around the bar area and were finally seated at 11:40 a.m. Waitress was also very nice.  Food: Meh, it was ok! After waiting for an hour and half, we could eat just about anything. Great bacon though. As previously stated, the kitchen was backed up - though, I'm not sure I understand why?? Maybe too many cooks in the kitchen? Easily, six people standing in the kitchen area.  Sorry Bakn, we will not be returning. Nor will I recommend it.",

    "text": "We arrived at this restaurant in Carnegie at 10 a.m. on a Sunday.  We knew it would be busy and it certainly was.  The host indicated that it would be an hour wait, and it was a little bit longer than that.  Definitely use the NoWait app to get in line before you arrive.  Once seated, the waitress was friendly and we ordered the Bak'n Flight for an appetizer.  (Can't go to a place called Bakn without trying out all the various flavors.)  I also ordered the peach bellini and saw lots of other people enjoying the mimosas, which are supposed to also be very good.  The appetizer and drinks arrived quickly.  Be careful with the appetizer, though.  The bacon tends to slide off the cutting board it is served on and we lost a strip to the floor.  We then waited over an hour for our food.  Not sure what happened.  Tables who were seated after us were done, paid their bill, and were leaving before we got our food.  I ordered the #1 breakfast sandwich and it was amazing.  I loved it and wished I lived closer to be able to enjoy it again.  The potatoes were also very good, and served so hot that I actually burned the inside of my mouth - be careful.  My daughter got the chocolate chip pancakes, which were very good.  Three pancakes makes a very large serving.  My other daughter ordered a bak'n burger since it was so close to lunch, which was uninspired and dry.  We wouldn't order the burger again.  We also got side orders of fruit, which were largely green and red grapes, with a few pieces of pineapple and blueberries.  I did not detect a sauce or sweetener on the fruit, just natural sweetness.  In total, our bill with tip came to $80, which is a bit pricey for breakfast.  It was also frustrating that we lost such a large portion of our Sunday in the Pittsburgh area waiting for a table and then waiting for food.  With that said, I haven't stopped thinking about the breakfast sandwich and am hoping to try to replicate it at home.",

The problem I have with trendy places is that they think it's okay to skimp on food because of the overall ambiance. I ordered their shrimp, avocado, and peach salad off the summer/seasonal menu. For $17.50, I got under-ripened avocados and...wait for it.... 3 SHRIMP. THREE. When my server came back to check on us, I kindly asked if it was possible to have at least 1-2 more shrimp and she said I would have to pay for an entire plate of them. Um, no thanks. For that price, the customer should always be right. But since they don't have an issue filling tables, it probably doesn't matter. Instead, the manager brought me an extra plate with a pile of feta, onions, and 4 puny peaches. Holy cannoli. I won't be back here unless someone else pays for my meal. If an owner (not a manager) wants to reply to this post, feel free!",

We had Salmon on polenta, the fritatta, basic eggs and bacon and the biscuits with bacon jam.

Because a lot of people do, the restaurant sits with empty tables while people waiting in the small front corner are forced to continue waiting until those with the app determine whether or not they want to show up.    The food is okay, but nothing to write home about considering the prices.  We also waited forever for the food and 4 out of the 5 of our meals weren't right (not even special orders).  The server was generous enough to offer we not tip him because he felt horrible for the service (I couldn't do that although a large part of me wanted to).  It's kind of sad that the perfectly capable server has to sacrifice a tip because the decision makers of the restaurant didn't find anything wrong with the experience and wouldn't agree to a discount.  He asked us to give them another chance - I can confidently say that will not be happening.",

    "text": "Mixed reviews about this place. The place itself is cute, small but still a short wait time for a party of 2. We sat at the bar because that was first available and had quick service with the drinks and also the food order. I started with the Bakn Bloody Mary it was garnished with peppered bacon and also a dill pickle giving the drink a pickle flavor that was different than most but in a good way. The menu had your basic breakfast foods, omelets , 2 egg special , pancakes but also had a couple breakfast sandwiches that made them stand out from your standard diner. I had high hopes for this place and I had a good experience at first. I went with the breakfast sandwich #1 that had a fried egg, cheese, arugula, roasted tomatoes, and a bacon mayo. We also got a side of Mac n cheese and 1 pancake to try. We waited a while for our food but we had read some reviews that the food takes a while to come out so we started some conversations with others at the bar who were locals and confirmed we couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu because everything was good. The couple next to us when we first got there had left, a new couple came and then we noticed they also were done with their food but we still hadn't received ours. More orders came out and were handed to us in error (they must've figured it had to be ours because we were waiting so long). Finally the person who took our order informed us that she did not have a problem putting the order in just as we asked except she did not hit the enter button for it to actually get placed!! So that explains all these people coming and going around us yet we still had not been served. The girl that first sat us even came over and asked \"how was everything\" thinking we must've eaten and our plates were cleared but we said we wouldn't know because we still had not gotten our food. She said she would check on it but that's when our food did come out.  Not impressed with the sandwich the egg to me was overdone and when I mentioned it to the server she said typically it's over medium and she would be willing to get me a new egg but I declined because I had already waited so long the sooner I could leave the better. The rest of the food was actually very good probably one of the best Mac n cheeses I have ever had and the syrup for the pancake had very good flavor. After I was half way done with my sandwich a surprise egg showed up.. I would say they did redeem themselves by doing that but at that point I really didn't want to eat anymore and felt that I had to since they had brought me the new egg. Once we got the bill we were told our drinks were taken off for the error with the food so that was another redemption. The food was ok, nothing special that I would want to go back even if they didn't forget to put in our order. I would say over all experience was not good.",

My pork belly tacos tasted great but were so fatty they made me nauseous and I couldn't keep eating. This wasn't regular pork belly fattiness but large chunks of fat.. my meat loving husband said the same for his pork belly Reuben. Returned again for brunch. Took over and hour to get seated because the hostess took the wrong number down (even after I double checked) and then when she called it and it said \"this number is not in service\" didn't check outside to see if we were waiting, just kept moving. Food came particularly slowly after that. I got the shrimp and grits this time which was quite disappointing. The shrimp was well seasoned but the grits were so bland I really had to just pick the meat out to eat. I get the hype around this place but we won't be back.",

I couldn't eat most of it (it has a POUND of bacon on it), so I took a lot back to my office and shared it with co-workers. I also got a side of greens  and it was a really nice fresh salad. Also good fresh squeezed lemonade. My friend had the breakfast sandwich #1. She seemed happy.

Our server was a little bit more laid back than we are used to but it all worked out.  Two in our group declared their bloody mary's the best they ever had.  Another raved about the mimosa.  My seasonal sangria was nothing spectacular but it was refreshing.  The bacon sampler that we all shared was a hit too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals very much.  I had the salmon with polenta and greens--it was an excellent choice.  My husband had the stuffed cubenell peppers with the egg on top--he loved, loved, loved it!  The menu is diverse enough that everyone should be able to find something.  And, it's creative enough that it feels like you have to move out of your comfort zone to try something that you may otherwise never have for lunch.  It was a good choice!

Spent 20 minutes milling around the consignment store next door and then 10 minutes standing outside. Went back inside and was told we were the next 4 top. Then some other folks on line started complaining that they had come in and watched people get seated before them and they were tired of waiting. I guess they decided to give them our table, as they got seated on the next table that opened up. They then took a table for 4 that opened up and split in in to 2 tables and seated some others.  The hostess told us that everyone is on the app and gets seated in order - not so! Seems like the loudest complainers get seated before others. The hostess is out of her depth.

    "text": "With a name like Bakn, you better bring home the bacon.  Oh those poor pigs, there's so many different kinds of bacon (pepper, applewood smoked etc.) and breakfast served ALL day?!  Bacon jam even, come on!  Can you tell this place lives up to its name in my opinion?  Awesome urban, modern decor.  Great service-from the servers to the bartenders to the host.  1 lb. bacon BLT?  Done.  Or should I say I enjoyed every morsel and am now in a bacon induced yelping coma?  Yes.   Ok with even with all of that said, you can bring your vegan and/or vegetarian friends here.  We also ordered the kale, quinoa and goji berry salad which was delicious.  Glad to see a place like this doesn't alienate veg heads as I have been one before and have many friends that don't eat meat.  I love main street in Carnegie and I love the new addition of Bakn, I really hope it succeeds.",

    "text": "My mom wanted to go there so we went for dinner. I ordered grilled chicken sandwich hoping to bypass consuming any bacon. I don't really like bacon but my mom does. Of course my sandwich came with two strips of applewood smoked bacon. I didn't want to make a scene so I took a bite and it was very good.  Mom had a waffle and bacon and she enjoyed it.  Food was good but friendly service was better.   Second visit did not go well.  Went to dinner and had a short wait. No big deal. After our drinks came we were forgotten about. The people next to us were seated 5 min after us and had their food before we even gave our order. Poor service. Double charged for a sangria after we were told they sold out. They were not so we were not charged for a ice tea   Waitress discovered the overcharge to her credit. My burger was very well done (we were no asked how we wanted our burger done)Chef served us the food and he was friendly.",

Our wait turned into 1.5 hours but Chef Randy was more than accommodating and apologetic about the wait.  We were promised appetizers upon sitting down at our table and he sure did deliver! Our meals were all delicious and he personally came over to thank us for waiting and sticking around to enjoy his menu! He also brought us fresh cookies to say thank you once again!! We will definitely be back. Can't say enough about the food, atmosphere and Chef Randy!!!",

Everything smells and looks delicious.  The quality of the food is appreciated as well as the great customer service. I look forward to a future visit with some friends to help persuade my next decision on what to try next from the menu.",

    "text": "I am a Carnegie local, happy with the trend towards more upscale dining on main street.  We've eaten here once so far, and it was pleasant. Nice decor, not too crowded for a weekend morning, well executed food, and pleasant service.  Despite a meat-heavy menu, there were sufficient vegetarian items that we didn't have to special order anything, which we had trepidation about from the name alone.  It's nice having more nearby breakfast choices than Gab'n'eat and Original House of Pancakes, and i hope for more quality places like Bakn to open in the area.",

    "text": "I have been to Bakn several times and was really looking forward to taking my parents who were visiting from out of town. We knew it would get busy for dinner on a Saturday night, so we arrived at 5:30 and saw several open tables. Unfortunately we had 5 adults and a toddler, so none of the small tables could accommodate us. The hostess said we could sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen, but my handicapped father can't manage the tall bar chairs. We asked if two smaller tables could be pushed together but was told that was \"against the law.\" We would have been willing to wait had the hostess seemed remotely interested in our business. We drove all the way across town to eat at Bakn, but chose to take our money elsewhere because of one unkind employee.  Also, this restaurant is not very accessible to people with mobility issues. I might also add that while I have enjoyed the food in the past, it's overpriced, as are the drinks.",

    "text": "Tried this restaurant for a Friday dinner. One member of our party asked if instead of french fries as her side, could she get mashed potatoes as we had already ordered a loaded fries appetizer. The waitress said no this wasnt possible, we would have to order mashed potatoes as an additional side. Seemed pretty stingy at the time but we went along with it and ordered mashed potatoes as an extra side. 15-20 minutes later the server comes out and informs us \"I talked to the chef and we are, like, out of mashed potatoes. Would you like fries instead?\"... How can a restaurant run out of potatoes (but not French fried potatoes) early on a Friday night is beyond my comprehension. And to not tell us until right before the food is about to come out? I suspect what actually happened is the waitress messed up the order and didn't want to admit it. We ended up getting charged for the side of fries that we didn't want in the first place. Besides that the rest of the food was mediocre. I won't be back.",

I ordered the Pork Belly Tacos while the rest of my party got the Bakn Burger and the Pork Belly Reuben.  The Bakn Burger was the best of the three but all dishes were good. I was very impressed with the staff. Our waitress was very attentive and Chef Randy checked and chatted with us multiple times. For dessert, we had bacon, bourbon, and maple ice cream in a mason jar. It was good but the bourbon was overwhelming! Overall, I enjoyed Bakn and want to try their breakfast.",
