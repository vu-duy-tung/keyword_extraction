I asked the waitress before ordering if the eggs for the omelets were out of the shell and she assured me they absolutely were. However the look was extremely uniform and as i said quite pale.  Like foam rubber. At  the check out i asked the owner/ host the same question. He was distracted  And when i said are the eggs for the omelets out of a carton, he said absolutely. Yes.. So. get the pancakes here.  Great variety and good.",

The young female manager with short black hair is rude unorganized and unprofessional. My family and I eat there often but after my last experience with her when we had to wait 35minutes for a table because they skipped over us and she then tried to blame us saying we said a highchair. Never once did we say a highchair my daughter is 5weeks old and we were holding here. Never once approached the table or apologized, the only saving grace was our servers who's name I will not mention because i feel that they might hold it against her. We will not be back too many other options in the area that actually appreciate they customers and the business. STAY AWAY!",

However, as it lays, I would prefer to eat at Denny's over The Original Pancake House.  And I hate Denny's. Really, really hate it.",

We waited for 35 minutes for a table, then had about 20 minutes at the table before being rushed out.  The waitress brought everything quickly--we had drinks, food, and the check (before we ever took a bite) within 7 minutes of sitting down.  I had the blueberry pancakes, which were dry and overcooked--Bisquick is better.  The water provided for my tea was lukewarm at best.  The waitress hovered around to take every cup or plate the second we finished.  Next time, I'll make my own pancakes at home so I don't have to feel like I'm being rushed.",

    "text": "Ive seen this place on the hill for several years, but it was only after seeing a coupon in the clipper mag that I decided to try it.  I will never go back again.  Then coupon clearly stated \"everyday specials\" and went on to list a combination of breakfast plates to choose from.  While waiting for my table (30 min after being quoted 15 on a Sat morning) I had decided which of the everyday specials I wanted, only to be told by my server that the \"everyday\" specials were only Monday -Thursday.  No place on my coupon listed that detail.  I asked to speak to the manager.  He came.  He was rude.  He said \"I'll make an exception just this once but next time be prepared to pay the correct amount\". This was pretty embarrassing given I was with my 3 children and he made me feel like I was asking for some type of concession when all I was doing was redeeming my coupon.  I stayed, I ate, I was further disappointed.  I asked for egg whites and was warned \"I would have to pay extra for that prep\". The tiny juice that was priced at a premium, and although was \"fresh\" tasted awful. My plate included 2 pancakes that were about 3 inches in diameter, and whoever made the batch went way to heavy on the vanilla extract, they tasted kinda metal, I really wasnt impressed with the flavor, and neither were my kids.  When my check came, the $4.50 plate cost me $7.99.  My server said it was because of the egg whites.  I expected $1 more tops, given the chef had the daunting task of scooping out the yolk from 1 egg, not the forfeiture of the concession the manager had offered me 30 minutes prior.  Even without the lackluster flavor, rude manager, and fraudulent advertising, the place felt pretentious; I wish I could further describe that, but it was just a feeling I got from the time I walked through the door.  It was kind of like trying to be some exclusive alternative to Bob Evans or something.",

    "text": "When: Saturday March 24, 2012 11:30am  Atmosphere: When I arrived there were people standing outside waiting for tables, this might fool you into thinking these people were actually waiting for a phenomenal breakfast. Instead I was met by a waiting area that was humid and hot and over crowded. It was also very loud and there was little seating, basically a hallway with a few benches.  The wait was around 30 minutes and we were greeted by a server and led to a table that had been \"cleaned\" and I use cleaned lightly. The table was covered in crumbs and debris from the previous guests. To the point someone had to wipe the bench of the booth off before we could sit down.  Experience: Once we were sat an impatient waiter took our drink order and returned quickly. A tip to anyone who may order water at this place, ask for a grown-up glass so you are not given a glass the size of a tomato paste can.  The menu was varied and had a lot of things to offer. I ordered the scrambled eggs and diced ham, a stack of pancakes and an order of turkey sausage.   First, the turkey sausage was the blandest, greasiest turkey sausage I've ever had the displeasure of eating. They appeared to have been fried in bacon grease. Also, for $3.99 you receive three sausage patties hardly larger than a half dollar. Very disappointing.  Second, the scrambled eggs and ham. It is so simple of a meal, but it was done so terribly. The eggs were under cooked, and clearly four eggs, meant two eggs extended with some kind of filler, like egg beaters, cream or milk. They were more a sludge than a light airy scrambled egg. The ham was also very poor quality, chipped ham from the deli would have been more satisfying.  Lastly, the pancakes...for being The Original Pancake House, I was underwhelmed with their basic pancakes. On the plus side, these were at least cooked well. However they had very little flavor, it pained me to have to pour syrup all over them to make them somewhat enjoyable.  Overall: The place was packed, hot and the wait staff was impatient, not rude, but very pushy. The food was borderline terrible, but if you like bland and kind of edible this is a place you should check out. Hopefully my experience was an anomaly but, it will take some real convincing to get me to go back to this place.",

First they treat you like kinda snotty, she told me there would be a 15 min. wait when I could clearly see there were many empty tables. Then our waitress was horrible, trying to make her understand was tough, I had a Entertainment book coupon.  I ordered a hamburger for the one meal and a reuben for me.  I needed to order two drinks, so I order a chocolate milk for my son, she was giving me a hard time because of the other kids, she was like if you order a 3rd kids drink you will have to pay for it.  I told her I needed to order 2 regular drinks to use the coupon so she brings the regular chocolate milk in a kids cup. No refill.  Now I had to pay for a large chocolate milk but he only got a kid size cup amount. First problem.  Then she says they are out of hamburgers at 12:45 on a thursday, after talking him into something else because he doesn't eat many things, she comes back and says they thawed out a hamburger!!  It was dry, my reuben was one of the worst I've ever eaten, a few strands of sour kraut, the swiss cheese has to be so thin you couldn't taste it and the corn beef was so dry it was chokeable. The potato pancake were paper thin and tasteless.  Second problem.  Our waitress disappeared, so trying to get a pop refill was beyond difficult. Third problem.  The pancake the girls got weren't so great that it made up for the rest, I will never go back I can't understand why people go there.  Bad service, Bad food.",

I was told by a male server standing there that they \"don't answer the phone when it's really busy\". The woman said that wasn't True and apologized.

I had the apple cinnamon blintzes...OMG amazing.  I had expected the cheese inside to be less cottage cheesy and more cream cheesy, but the taste was there nonetheless.  My side of sausage put my calorie total for the meal probably more than I care to know, but I enjoyed every single bite of it.    My husband had a western omelet, which was the size of...no...BIGGER THAN...your face!  He also thoroughly enjoyed it and had enough to take home for another whole meal.    So many delicious and tempting options - we most definitely are going back because I want to try so many more things.    The only thing I can only slightly complain about was the waitress seeming impatient with us not leaving.  I met old friends for breakfast and yes, afterwards, we sat around and talked for about 20 minutes.  My mom was a waitress full-time (and so was I during college) so I understand the idea of table turnover, especially around breakfast time when meals are cheap, tips tend to be bad, and the fast table turnover is the only redeeming quality of working morning shift.  She seemed a bit pester-y though as we were sitting around, and kinda made me uncomfortable.  I did leave her an amazing tip though, for greedily taking up her only 8-top at peak breakfast hours.",

My crepe was delicious. The coffee cups are cute. Mom and Rica like the lingonberry jam that comes with the Swedish pancakes. The menu lists calories for all the dishes, which is helpful.",

During my pregnancy I craved their food so pretty much made the resturant my second home for 9 months. There food is amazing. I usually get the Reese crepes.  The orange juice tastes like it was freshly squeezed right before it is brought to the table and they never let your coffee cup go empty.  The management there is so sweet and accomidating.  I have had mostly great servers with one exception. I don't remember her name but I discretely paid for a man's meal sitting next to us who was dining alone. I even left her a tip on my cedit receipt. After he left she came to our table and said that was really nice of you but can you believe he didn't even leave me a tip... I was highly offended but  that's the only time I've ever had a negative experience in the 4 years I have been dining there and one server is not going to warp my views of the company as a whole.",

They used to be well known for their big omelette's but they aren't so big anymore and now their waffles are about the size of Eggo's. Since that was the main thing they had going for them, it's a big problem. The service is always kind of odd. They absolutely cannot handle a giant serving dish with multiple things on it as they prefer to bring things by hand. Don't expect your food to come all at one time, because it won't.  Other problems: - If you want anything more than eggs, pancakes or toast, prepare to pay a ton for it and prepare for lots of questions from the staff. I like to bring stuff home to eat and they consistently make me feel awful for it. They love to throw in snide remarks with the one saying \"I guess your eyes were bigger than your stomach\". She found out that her mouth was bigger than her tip. - Want a full size breakfast kielbasa? Not happening. Want a half size one? $7. - $8 Waffles. Yes, $8 Waffles. You can buy the waffle mix for half that price.",

    "text": "We have been going here when friends and family visit for years. Today took parents, who were thrilled to see the options for Pumpkin, Gingerbread, or Red Velvet pancakes. We asked the waitress about the prices on this since they don't put the prices on their signs or in the menu (leaving the impression these are just optional flavor choices when you get pancakes). Turns out it is a $2.50 surcharge to \"enhance\" your free 3 pancakes (with egg orders) with these optional flavors. We wanted to try 2 flavors, so the waitress suggested we buy a \"full stack\" which has 8 pancakes so we could get 4 of each for $8.99. We said great. Later they bring the bill and have charged us $14.00 for the 8 pancakes!! We ask the waitress and she said \"sorry, but I had the price wrong\" and walked away....we asked her to come back and she said she guessed she could talk to the manager but she didn't think he would fix it. Next thing we know the manager comes over and says the waitress said we wanted to speak to him and acted like he had no idea what it was about. We explained and he says, \"yeah, we don't allow special flavored pancakes on the full stack, and I have told this to your waitress.\" We said this is not what we were told so we want to pay what we were told, and he said he would have to confirm this situation with the waitress. Then, the waitress comes back and says the manager wanted us to know he would not adjust our price, and she said she was sorry but she figured he wouldn't do it.  SERIOUSLY!!  They lie to us about the price and they play the blame game back and forth between each other until ultimately telling us to eat their mistake anyhow. Incredibly rude and treated us like we were asking for a favor. Horrible, I have never seen a more inept manager in some time.....good luck with your experience.",

The buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! The homemade syrup is great too. A short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. A short stack is more than enough for the average person.  They give you a huge portions of everything. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is something special but, at $4 a glass is pretty steep. I can buy a whole bottle of Simply Orange for that!  The service is what needs the help. The servers seem like they don't want to be there. Once you receive your food make sure you have everything you need before they walk away. You have to hunt them down if you need something or for refills.  F.Y.I.

The dutch baby is a huge double layered pancake that is crispy on the edges and then puffy and soft/ almost chewy in the middle. It comes with lemon and powdered sugar to make a glaze in the center and it's delicious. Presentation is hilarious- it comes out straight from the oven before the center has fallen- it's huge! The 49er flap jacks are good too they are thin like a crepe and again crisp on the edge.   The bacon and sausage links are both good. Typical diner coffee that they refill when you've only just started drinking it. The homefries are soft and oniony- perfect with copious amounts of ketchup.   Ore servers have always been good.

I thought it was a bit strange that the menu notes \"No Returns\" on juice. Seriously? People have tried to return their juice?  For our meals, he ordered the eggs benedict with potato pancakes and I ordered the apple waffle with a side of whipped cream. To my surprise, the whipped cream is legit - no cool whip here. He quickly devoured his meal, while I made it about half way through my portion of waffles. Overall, the food was good, much better than nearby iHop or Bob Evans.",

The Dutch Baby was made to perfection and was served with generous amounts of toppings including butter, pecans, strawberries and powdered sugar.

The 49er pancakes were described on the menu something along the lines of soft, chewy, as big as your plate.   The plates looked spectacular. The apples were sauteed al dente, the 49er pancakes surpassed expectations. When they arrived, they took were about 7/8 the size of the plate. In a moment of gluttony, I basically inhaled the 49er cakes, sans syrup.  Perfect taste and texture. It literally took me 3 minutes to crush them. A couple minutes later, the manager came over with another one, saying it looked like I was a little slighted. Thought that was awesome, great move even though I didn't feel remotely slighted. Well played gesture indeed.  It's nearly impossible to beat a Pamela's pancake, but The Original Pancake House now has a new loyal. I'm telling you, the 49er pancake is worth its weight in, well, you know.",

This is about where the good things ended.     I got the eggs/bacon/pancake special.    The pancakes were good and the highlight of the meal.   I got the eggs scrambled.  They were cold and soupy. The bacon was thick cut (yay!!) but was also cold and undercooked.   This breakfast was just \"ok\" and very disappointing. I'm sure that there are better spots to go to and I won't be going back.",

    "text": "A Pathetic, Disturbing Experience  Such a pity, I'd rather be providing good marks to the restaurant at risk. However, the insincerity and lack of managerial tact (including corporate response) knows no bounds.  I would have loved to review my meal here in a positive light, however, it's not every day you have your worst ever restaurant experience. Unfortunately, moments after being seated, my newborn (three weeks old), wife and I walked out after being threatened and insulted by the owner.  It occurred on September 26th, 2012, at about 11:45 AM. I walked into The Original Pancake House in McIntyre Square off of McKnight Road, the house 90% empty. Literally, it was my first meal outside of our house since my newborn arrived, three weeks earlier. My wife and I attempted to get out for the first time since her traumatic surgery, complications giving birth to our first, a daughter. Oddly enough, the restaurant service experience gods punished me, for some ungodly reason.  While walking in, I noticed a man (quite well-dressed) casually looking at seven patrons in line, in no hurry to seat anyone. It turns out the man was Chuck, the owner (I'll get back to him later, he was completely insincere, threatening and as the experience developed, an utter joke and mockery of a restaurant owner). He assumed that we were in some larger party and we weren't. Wait time to be greeted, 15+ Minutes (remember, the establishment is 90% empty). Strike One.  After a few waiting patrons had been seated, I questioned a waitress on seating availability. She asked us if we were waiting to be seated in a \"Party of 16\". I said, \"absolutely not.\" She walked away and failed to return. Mind you, we're still waiting. An additional 10 minutes of waiting before we're finally seating. (remember, the establishment is still 90% empty, if not emptier at that point). Strike Two.  After finally being seated, Chuck, the owner, attempted to apologize. However, this was done in a very nasty manner, with quite the attitude and tone. At that point, with a hungry new mom and cranky baby, I had experienced enough, we walked out and inexplicably Chuck was barking at us on the way out the door, with me questioning his anger and approach. I told him I'll not be back and he said, \"GOOD, I DON'T WANT YOU BACK!\" He was yelling at me in front of my wife and newborn. This is completely unacceptable behavior from any restaurant employee, let alone an owner / franchisee. Strike Three.  Like any good follow up process and knowing I'd receive little satisfaction from contacting the same owner, Chuck, I decided to call the corporate office in Oregon. After speaking to corporate for nearly 20 minutes, whom were disinclined to acquiesce to any of my requests (apologies and compensation for bad service), I've come to realize the extent of this clown outfit. Additionally, I found corporate to be just as rude as well, in that he presumed the basis of my anger stemmed from sleepless nights. Actually, this couldn't be further from the truth. Our newborn sleeps well and sleep hasn't been an issue. Assumptions / presumptions are the mother of all, you know what's (I'll keep it clean). A puppet and puppeteer, in on the take together and at the expense of the consumer, quite the incestuous business relationship, I should say.  The most ridiculous thing, and anyone reading this with even the most basic understanding of social media and reputation management, corporate management barked that social media was unimportant to them. I threatened them by telling them that I'd take this socially. I wonder if they're reading this review? I'll be sure to post it to as many restaurant review sites, as possible, not just Urbanspoon, but Yelp, CitySearch, etc. Don't forget Facebook, Twitter, etc.   Accountability is important in today's society. This specific establishment needs to be able to learn the importance of just that, accountability. Surely, they lack accountability on all levels.  Needless to say, I didn't care much for either of their attitudes and the entire dining experience, if you can call it a dining experience. Avoid this location and any of their locations, at all costs. We went to a competitor, down the street, for far less cost and so should you. Tu es le pire!  Buon Appetito!",

    "text": "I stopped here with my wife on a Sunday afternoon for a heavy brunch.  Having been to the Original Pancake House in the south hills, we had a general idea of what we would be getting into.  Overall, the place is a bit more disorganized than the one in the south hills.  Upon arrival, we put our names in to the host and were skipped over several times before having to approach the host where our names were accidentally crossed out. He was apologetic and he seated us right away.  The menu here is simple.  Mostly breakfast foods and an emphasis on pancakes! If you have a sweet tooth it's definitely worth checking out.  The food all looks very impressive, especially the pancakes.  However, my wife and I satisfied our sweet tooth with a very creamy hot chocolate first.  Would highly recommend trying their hot chocolate here, definitely a step above the rest. I ordered eggs southwest style with home fries and my wife had something similar. The home fries weren't nearly as good as I remember them, and one of the potatoes was under cooked. The eggs were still just as good and I ended up bringing half the meal home for later.   Overall some pretty good breakfast/brunch food with a young, energetic, and disorganized staff.  Definitely not opposed to coming back here however.  They do make some pretty awesome breakfast combinations.",

The OHOP really delivers on is value proposition of serving a fabulous array of pancakes.  I've had several, from the German/Dutch Baby to the classic with some sort of flavoring.  Blueberry is my go-to fave, though, and they are perfect as far as I'm concerned.  It may also surprise patrons to know, however, that their non-pancake items are stars in their own right.  For instance, the bacon that is nice and thick and stands up on its own.  A 4 slice side ain't cheap, but it's worth it. Their omelettes are also lovely and huge; I don't recommend trying to eat an entire one by yourself with other food unless you're a bodybuilder or have a tapeworm or something. Bring a buddy and split it; that's what I do.  All in all, when it comes to breakfast, OHOP is one of my favorite places.",

    "text": "The best pumpkin pancakes since the ones I had at the amazing Dor-Stop in Dormont a few years ago, and that's saying something!! They were so good, that I really didn't need much syrup, and I usually bury them in syrup!  good stuff!  Speaking of syrup, they have a tropical syrup that is awesome, but it just wasn't quite right with this combination.    So the pancakes were awesome, the ham was OK, but it was a thick slice of lunch meat which unfortunately, has become the norm these days, it was prepared OK, and tested pretty good, but I really like the real thing that isn't processed, and based on the pictures I saw on yelp, that's what I thought I was going to get.  It was OK, but nothing to get excited about like the ham you get at De Luca's for example.    Service was quick and friendly, and you need to know that it seemed like all the pancakes and waffles come ala' carte, so if you like sausage or ham or bacon, it's going to get a little pricey.    If I go back, I would get the pumpkin pancakes again, but I would skip the ham at $4.25 for a side item.",

However, I was immediately seated.  The waitress went over the menu with me. I decided on the strawberry pancakes that come topped with fresh strawberries, and on the side, strawberry and maple syrup. I also ordered bacon to go with it. It is pretty cool that they ask how you would like your bacon cooked. It didn't take long for my meal to come out. And it was absolutely delicious. Everything tasted very fresh and was on point. If you around in the area, and can catch the time that is open, check it out!",

    "text": "Today was my first time eating at The Original Pancake House, and oh my am I blown away.  Best. Pancakes. Ever.  I'm serious, IHOP has nothing on this place. I came here with my boyfriend and his mother for brunch, but we all ordered breakfast. I got 3 chocolate chip short stacked pancakes, with two piece of bacon, German-style home fries, and two scrambled eggs. Best breakfast I've ever had! I ate every single bite of what I ordered. My boyfriend got some corned beef hash, and his mother got 3 original short stacked pancakes, two scrambled eggs and two pieces of bacon on the side. They both loved what they ordered. She said they were the best pancakes she's every had, and my boyfriend agreed, and he didn't even order pancakes. He stole quite a few bites my my pancakes and his mother's, and he regrets not ordering pancakes. He did exclaim that his hash was spectacular however. This might be our new regular spot to come to brunch. For the 3 of us to eat it was only 45$, pretty reasonable in my eyes. I'm not a huge breakfast person, and anytime I go to brunch, I typically order lunch and not breakfast, but this place makes me wanna come back and pig out on some breakfast. They have a little bit of everything too! Pancakes, French toast, waffles, crepes, traditional breakfast, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, and tons of sides. I have no complaints about this place and highly recommend!",

Let me tell you, if you are in the area and want a really great breakfast (at a pretty decent price too) served with a smile and speed, go here.  The wait is absolutely worth it, no matter how long the hostess says the delay is when you arrive.  Wait for it, you won't be sorry.",

Not saying I don't like chains (Red Lobsters biscuits bring me such joy) but sometimes they can be inconsistent.   I want to preface this part of the review by saying that when I go out for breakfast, I usually get something salty rather than sweet. However, I can't go to the Original Pancake House and not get pancakes. I'm so glad I went with pancakes because DANG.  I had a really hard time deciding what to get because there are so many appealing options. I opted for the Georgia Pecan Short-stack with a side of breakfast potatoes. My boyfriend got the Apple Cinnamon pancakes with a side of bacon. The bacon was insane. It was so thick and crispy, but still juicy. The Georgia Pecan pancakes were nothing short of perfect - same with the apple cinnamon. The potatoes could've used more seasoning or even onion, but were very good.   I'm definitely going to be back. Next time, I'll make sure I have enough time so I can try the Dutch Baby!",

I would have thought that a place of business would encourage repeat customers and woiuld want more business.  They offer Coupons and offers online and in emails, but do everything possible NOT to honor the discounts. - MUST present the coupon and have the  name ON the coupon. - Everyone MUST buy an overpriced beverage - Must not be used on the weekend - Sides and extras not discounted I had an argument with the manager who would not accept the coupon because it did not have the name of the business on it, I presented it the way it was printed out. She made such a big deal about it and we were talking about maybe a $4.00 discount. I hope it was worth $4.00 to them for losing 3 customers.",

This franchise occupies a site of a former restaurant and the decor had not been changed. The food was very good but the hostess and our server both openly complained about \"too many customers\" and \"They don't wrap the flatware and it isn't efficient\". Our waitstaff did not bring all of our order, forgot bacon and seemed to forget us after our food was brought to the table. When bus staff was cleaning tables next to us, they left the bucket with soapy water on the floor where customers could trip over it. (And the restaurant is quite tight and cramped.) After we left and had driven about 20 minutes, I realized that my credit card was missing. When we tried calling the restaurant (8 times), my wife and I kept getting a message that the phone number was unavailable. When my wife eventually got through, the hostess answered and instead of putting her on hold, she set the phone down and forgot to pick it back up. My wife could hear conversations for a few minutes. We eventually had to go back to the restaurant. All of this took over an hour. I will never return here to eat.",

We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The place was dirty - our table had not been wiped off before we sat down, my chair was sticky and the floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in days. Service was bad. We were forgotten about on more than one occasion, it took our waitress 15 minutes to come back and take our order after bringing us water.   The experience alone made it difficult for me to enjoy my meal which was sub-par. I got bacon, eggs and toast but that may have been my fault since it is the original house of pancakes - not bacon and eggs.   There are far better breakfast joints in and around Pittsburgh, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you expect anything better than a Denny's or Bob Evans.",

I work in a restaurant and act as a fill in manager when needed, and I can tell you that if my advertisement was incorrect and a customer mentioned it to me, I'd comp the portion of that check, no questions asked. His customer service skills are completely lacking. I come here every time I am in the area but not sure I'd go back based on his attitude. No offense but I can get pancakes anywhere..  The best part was we ordered two pieces of sausage but ended up getting and paying for two as we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

We only waited about 10 minutes though to be seated. The front desk, host, and waitress were all very nice. We were waited on promptly. Having reviewed the menu on the OPH app it didn't take me long to figure out what I wanted. The in house menu is very well laid out.   Food: I got bacon, eggs over easy, 3 blueberry pancakes, and coffee. My wife got granola, raisin, and shredded coconut pancakes with a veggie omelet. All the food was excellent. The blueberry pancakes had baked in blueberries with blueberry sauce (optional) and powered sugar. I added maple syrup. The texture, sweetness, and flavor were perfect. The bacon was amazing! Thick, flavorful. Some pieces were a little chewy but still good. My wife's veggie omelet was huge as shown in the photo. It had veggies and cheese inside. I'd  give the omelet a 4/5 rating.   The food portions are large from bacon, to omelets, to pancakes. I barely finished my meal and my wife could not finish hers! The coffee was excellent too.  Overall: The portion size, flavor, and price cannot be beat here. We got a ton of food for about $30. Forget IHOP and Eat'n Park. Do yourself a favor and get some OPH pancakes, waffles, French toast, crepes, etc.! (and no I don't work for OPH) The experience was very positive. We will be returning soon!",
