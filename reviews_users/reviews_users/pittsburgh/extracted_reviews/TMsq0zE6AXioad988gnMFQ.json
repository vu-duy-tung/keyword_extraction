My two experiences have both been with brunch, but let me tell you.....each time it has been unbelievably tasty! I have ordered their steaks and eggs which is out of this world. My table had eggs benedict, and some other egg dishes which were all greatly enjoyed as well. Not to mention you get a free mimosa with your meal!  What makes the place even better is the atmosphere and service. Both are outstanding! Can't wait to come back.",

I ended up eating half of my husband's dish. Also, the seasoned potatoes were tasty. My lemon poppyseed waffle with blackberries and cream (special menu I think--likely not offered regularly) was only okay, but my husband liked it so we shared and all was well. A cute little place we will definitely visit again!",

Knows me so well that she has a can of Coke for me as I'm coming in the door. Always asks how my mother is. The food is always very good, made from fresh ingredients.

    "text": "I was super disappointed by this place.  We got there and there were plenty of 4 top tables available, but since we were a table of 5 and their 6 top tables were taken we had to wait.  Even though they could have easily pushed 2 of the 4 top tables together.  I understand they'd rather not waste a 2nd table, but there were 4 or 5 empty tables, so it didn't make a lot of sense (and there were still empty tables when we left).  They finally squeezed all 5 of us onto a 4 top, which was fine, but sort of awkward.  Following this, they didn't take our order for more than 15 minutes, even though they really weren't very busy.  These were both mildly annoying and I wouldn't have thought anything more about it, but the worst part is that they included the gratuity and made it a presumptuous 20%, which was sort of the end for me.  I'd been there once before with a party of 6 and they did not include the gratuity then (which is usually the minimum for when they'll include gratuity, but is still traditionally only 18%).  I think they assumed we were unhappy and wanted to make sure they still got a tip (which we would have, but the whole point of a tip is for service.  Had I known you could just add your own, I would have done that a lot more when I was a waitress).   I just thought the entire visit was rude and left a bad taste in my mouth.  They made a point of saying \"please come back again\" when they gave us our check, but frankly I'm not sure why I would.  The food was good, but then there are plenty of other breakfast places with good food that have far better and friendlier service.",

There would be a huge line and open tables, but the tables took 20-30 minutes to get bussed. For a small place, that needs to be taken care of a lot quicker.  The food also went down hill. One time, both of our orders had 2 cold potato pancakes and 2 warm ones. The eggs Benedict specials were always my favorite, until the eggs started to be cooked poorly. Last week I actually got sick after. I would still go there for pancakes and scrambled eggs, but nothing else. The people are super nice, but too slow and too few staff on weekends.",

The wait was 20 minutes, so we put our names in and told the manager that we were going to take a walk. The manager said that he would note that and try to not skip us if we were back in 20 minutes. Not a lot of places will do this, so we were pretty impressed. We came back from our walk and were seated within 5 minutes. The room was pretty damn hot, to be honest. There weren't a lot of people in there, so the air conditioning was possibly not working. Which, on a humid Sunday morning, felt pretty muggy. Our waitress was an older woman who was pleasant, however we felt a bit rushed. She seemed annoyed that we weren't ready to order yet and came back twice in less than 7 minutes. J ordered his normal eggs, bacon, toast, and home fries. I ordered an omelet with tomatoes, cheese, and broccoli. Both came with ciabatta bread which was a nice surprise and pretty good. We also received complimentary mimosas which made my day! The food overall was pretty good and the manager was nice, which made our overall experience a 3/5.",

    "text": "The Cafe on Main in Sharpsburg is often overlooked when Pittsburghers are pondering where to go for breakfast. I've always thought it was a shame that this place wasn't more popular as they serve a very good breakfast.  Their pancakes are flavorful and come with many options (blueberry, banana & chocolate hazelnut, choc chip & pecan, etc), their omelets are loaded with fixin's, they use a quality ciabatta bread for their breakfast sandwiches, their corned beef hash is outstanding, etc.  The only breakfast item that I would ding are their sausage links.  They look, taste, and have the texture of pre-made, pre-cooked, links that have been microwaved. In fact the sausage links seem like what you'd get at McDonalds.   So, you're probably wondering why did I give them just 2 stars?  Well, I brought my brother, sister-in-law, & nephews in from out east and my mom & Dad in from the North Hills to enjoy a Father's Day brunch at the Cafe on Main.  My Dad arrived early and took a seat in their waiting area.  Dad gave an older \"gentleman\" who appeared to be running things (the owner?) his name and the size of our group and was curtly told \"we don't seat you until everyone is here.\" My Dad clearly wasn't asking to be seated in the dining room yet - he had settled in on a chair in the waiting area. A few minutes later my Dad asked this \"gentleman\" if he could have a cup of coffee. The response? \"I'm waiting on customers.\"  So I suppose an elderly man who has told you that a group of 7 will be eating at your establishment on Father's Day isn't a \"customer\"?   Our full group arrived and after waiting about 15 more minutes (Dad had patiently waited, with no beverage, over 45 min) , we were seated.     Our waitress was nice and helpful.  She would disappear for long stretches but we knew it was a busy day for them so we didn't get frustrated.  As various people finished eating she was quite prompt with clearing the table, which we appreciated. As our meal was winding down, I paid the check so that would be taken care of and we could leave as soon as everyone finished eating.  Given that it was a holiday and I could see how hard she was working while keeping a smile on her face, I left a 30% tip.   So, it seems we have a delightful Dad's Day, right?  Well, almost.  Despite the fact that two people in our group were still eating, the \"gentleman\" who was running the show came over to our table and quite rudely told us that \"people were waiting\" and we needed to \"move on out.\"  His tone was abrasive and there was not even a hint of courtesy.  Please keep in mind that we had waited to be seated too, once we were seated the waitress did quickly ask for our order but when we asked for a \"few more minutes\" we ended up waiting almost 15 to get her back to the table. The food was also slow to come out.  What I'm saying is that we weren't dilly-dallying and holding up progress. We were at the table a good 30 minutes with no food.  We had been at the table about 1 hr and 15 min when the \"gentleman\" essentially kicked us out. About 40% of that time was waiting on his restaurant to serve us. Two of us were still eating when he asked us to leave!   I understand that small restaurants need a turnover but there's a polite way to encourage your guests to finish up and there's this \"gentleman's\" way.  Both my brother and father, the two we were celebrating today, were disgusted by this \"gentleman's\" behavior and told me that they would never come back here.  A lovely meal ruined by a crabby ol' man with a sharp tounge.",

I've been there a ton to visit my sisters and we always try to hot spots (Pamela's, Kelly O's, etc etc).  The nutella/banana pancakes at Cafe on the Main are to die for.  Large portions (too large to handle but hey you have leftovers!), perfectly cooked pancakes, perfect sweetness.  The potatoes with onions have an amazing flavor.  The coffee was delicious.  And the service is excellent - really friendly - really down to earth place.  I come back here for brunch each time I come back into town now!",

I don't think I've ever liked a breakfast/cafe more. And trust me, breakfast food is definitely my thing. It's not only their fresh, huge, amazing omelets with the best cheeses and vegetable combos you could imagine. It's not there perfect breakfast potatoes or complimentary mimosas, or delicious ciabatta toast. It's not because it's one of the few breakfast places in Pittsburgh to serve Eggs Benedict, which is on my list of top five favorite meals. Actually, those all definitely add to it. But really it's just one of those places that I don't think I'd ever mind waiting, or sitting by the door when the dining room is too full. It's got character and you can tell everyone who works there seems proud to, even if there a little stressed out from a Sunday crowd.",

Part of me wants to go back every day just to see what new items are being offered....but then again, part of me is afraid to because it all sounds so good.  I've selected the Eggs Benedict special both times.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious, and you can tell that great care and thought has gone in to each dish.  The home fries were some of the best around.  Most recently I was there on a late Sunday morning.  Imagine my joyful surprise in learning that a complimentary mimosa came with my menu selection that day!  As if the fantastic food and great service weren't enough.  I can't wait to go back.

My waitress was extremely friendly and made sure to introduce me to the owner.    I felt very welcome.  There was a line but was seated pretty quickly in this cafe setting.  I ordered the German omelet with Potato Pancake.  The german omelet was a corned beef and kraut.  The mix was surprisingly very good.  The potato cakes were not great - after tasting the omelet - I had higher expectations.    The sour cream and applesauce provided me a oktoberfest memory that made me long for a stein of beer.  Though I was full and my big boy pants were stretch to capacity - I did order one apple spice pancake.   WARNING - THE BELOW COMMENTS WILL MAKE YOU IMMENDIATELY HUNGRY AND LONG FOR A STACK OF PANCAKES ...  Okay - maybe the above commen is over the top but the cake went down so fast - there are no pictures.   Maybe it did not even exist but oh boy - was it good.   I believe they sautee paper thin sliced apples in butter seasoned in cinnamon.  After the apples are softened, they pour their pancake batter.   The pancakes are thin.  Summary:  Atmosphere - nice - 12-15 tables in a small room.  You are pretty close to your neighbors but still a nice atmosphere.  Service - Great / Super / Friendly - My waitress made me feel welcome and ensured my food was hot and coffee plentiful.  Price - $9-$13 - I did order a pancake with my breakfast  All was awesome and I cannot wait to go back!",

Even though there was a line we managed to be seated in only 10 minutes. I'm sure the group behind us wasn't to thrilled to see us seated before them but there was only 2 of us and 4 of them so the larger tables were limited.   There was a small dining area when you first walk in . Only 3 tables mostly for 2 guest. The one we sat at could seat three but after order our food and beverages there was no more room on the tables. We ordered our breakfast in a timely manner. I took notice in the corn beef hash special. It came with the hash, sunny side eggs, and toasted ciabatta with grits. At only $9.00 i was very happy with the meal. My hubby ordered the Mediterranean omelette that also came with ciabatta and he ordered potato pancakes. Everything was delicious. The bread was perfectly toasted, the hash  was so delicious and not greasy, the grits had lots of flavor and weren't over cooked or dry. I LOVED IT!! the omelette had kalmata olives in it that made this dish burst with flavor and it was a pretty big omelette.   The main seating area only had about 9 tables so it's a pretty small place. But, the one thing i love about small places is the attentiveness that the servers have for you. They came back to the table frequently to make sure we were enjoying our selves and they even offered us complimentary mimosa's. i couldn't turn down that offer.   I especially enjoyed how the host came and sat at our table telling us stories from his past while also boasting about the great eats this place had to offer. He was about 70 and so generous to sit and talk with us about his restaurant. We loved the conversation and would definitely return again for sunday brunch. I only wish that this place would stay open a little later but given it's location i guess business would suffer more than succeed.",

    "text": "I was disappointed with my visit to Cafe on Main.  My husband's Belgian waffle was cooked to a crisp. It wasn't burnt, but it wasn't fluffy at all. I was hard and dry. It was supposed to be lemon poppy-seed flavored, but I couldn't taste it.  I ordered the eggs benedict special, but without the meat, and with the eggs cooked so that they practically hard-boiled. My meal was delivered with meat on the sandwich, so I sent it back. When I finally did get my order, the eggs weren't cooked as well as I like. While not runny, they were still pretty gel-like. I know they probably rushed to get them out due to the mix-up, which I appreciate to a point, but...  The hollandaise sauce wasn't impressive, either. It missed that tanginess that makes hollandaise sauce so irresistible. This was just bland yellow goo atop the egg.  I did like the potato pancakes, but they were tiny. I left hungry and bored.  The server was pleasant and prompt with refills, and the dining area was cute, but those small positives aren't enough to outweigh the fact that food was mostly boring and/or bad.",

My husband had a chorizo omelet that was made perfectly. We also loved the hotcakes!   We got there at 8:30 (also a nice bonus that they open early on weekends) and parking is free and easy.   It was so much fun to find a new breakfast place --I love Pamela's, but it was fun to switch it up and visit cute Sharpsburg. They are located really close to Bona Terra (another gem that I'd like to try).",

Our initial impression this time was minus 3 stars due to the rudeness of front staff when you walk in. I understand they don't like to seat groups until all are there-all but one were there and one was on way. No, nada no way were we going to be seated until all were present. Once we sat down,  our table was so close to another.  A staff person was talking with the guests at that table. She would not step over to allow me to sit. We had to move the table and she still didn't step aside. I thought she might tell  us we couldn't move the table. Back to breakfast- it was good. We had waffles and omelets  with toast, fruit and home fries. The coffee was warmed up once but no refills  on water. The kicker is that at 25% tip was added to bill!  We were a group of 5.  It wasn't a 25% experience by far. When paying I asked if we could leave a cash tip. I actually had to ask !! We left a nice tip but it wasn't 25% !! Food may be good but it's better to be nice.",

It's a relaxed homey casual place but with slightly upscale menu filled with omelets and variations on eggs benedict, as well as an ever changing list of specials. The most important thing is the Lyonnaise potatoes - get them with the onions and peppers they are delicious. We have never been disappointed.",

Look no further than on Main Street in Sharpsburg! Located right off the bridge headed to route 28. We were looking for a place on our way to Pittsburgh Mills shopping center. Also it's an Easy entry back on to 28 after your done.  Charming old building on Main Street provides for a comfortable setting inside. Specials listed on blackboard as you enter. They have some amazing offerings for breakfast. (See photos)   With so many different options, you are certain to find one for everyone in your party. we choose the pancakes with bacon, dippy eggs with yummy spicy, but not too spicy sausage, and the amazing omelette filled with roasted red peppers, provolone cheese, asparagus and ham. everything was delicious! The omelette was amazing! The potatoes were seasoned perfectly! We now can't wait to now try lunch if we are nearby.   Service was fast and efficient. They were not warm and fuzzy, but food was properly prepared and we never waited for refills. The only recommendation I could make would be to tell the servers to smile more! :) hence, the 4 instead of 5 rating.  Summary: Do yourself a favor and break away from the chains and go here! Who wants to really wait for 1/2 hour or more to eat at Eat-n-park anyway???? We didn't even wait here, just sayin.",

It seemed pretty busy, and an older gentleman directed us to our table in the front of the cafe after just a moment of waiting. He was quite abrupt with customers, not super friendly, and kept addressing our waitress with questions while she was trying to help us. That was pretty annoying, as our waitress was great, but her ability to serve us was happened by him not just letting her do her job.   Complementary mimosas was a fun surprise! I ordered a platter that included two pancakes, eggs, home fries, bacon, and ciabatta toast. The serving sizes are plentiful, so you could probably split that platter with someone unless you're really hungry. I normally house my breakfast food and didn't eat my eggs, half my potatoes, and one whole pancake. The pancakes are fluffy and great. The home fries are just large pieces of red skinned potatoes. The flavoring was nice and they were cooked well, but they would have been a lot better cut smaller. Coffee is pretty good. Service wasn't bad. I'd definitely go again!",

They delivered well on both counts.  That coffee was hot, good, and kept on coming!  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The fresh fruit that went on the side was very good for it being an off-peak season.  As I glanced around, I could tell I was among locals, perhaps regulars.  Service was prompt and attentive.

    "text": "Adorable little brunch spot in the heart of main street Sharpsburg. It's decorated beautifully with charming garden decor that makes it feel incredibly homey. It is quite small inside (probably only 10 or so tables), so expect a bit of a wait on the weekends (they do turn tables over quickly though).  The food was phenomenal. They had a huge list of specials chock full of seasonal ingredients, as well as a comprehensive regular menu. We each couldn't decide what to get, so we went splitsies -- among the two of us we ordered the peach and brie stuffed french toast, banana Nutella pancakes, and an order of home fries -- and we shared it all.  Everything we ate was divine. The french toast was made with thick bread that was cooked just enough to give it a lightly toasted outside while still remaining soft and tender inside. The brie cheese was velvety and mild and nicely complemented the spiced, succulent peaches. Yum x 1000! The banana Nutella pancakes were also heavenly -- soft and tender, spiked with real bananas throughout, and covered with tons and tons of Nutella. It was sweet and sinful and everything a good breakfast should be. And let's not forget the home fries. They consisted of chunks of beautifully seasoned red potatoes that were cooked to perfection so that they had a nice caramelization on top, but remained fluffy and tender inside. We left completely stuffed and satisfied, with motivation to do little else for the rest of the day but nap ;)  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Our waiter was very attentive and even offered us a complimentary mimosa while we waited for our food. The owner's father chatted us up while we were waiting in line and after we were seated at our table. He was really friendly and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know us. That really added an adorable element of \"mom-n-pop-ness\" to this place. I do have to take off a star in this area though, because at one point he yelled a joke to us from across the room that contained an ethnic term that is outdated at best and at worst could have potentially offended someone. I know he wasn't trying to make anyone uncomfortable (I think it's probably a generational issue), but I'm taking off a star just because I think you have to be sensitive to that sort of thing.  Overall though, we had a great meal in a great setting, so we'll definitely be back. This is an awesome alternative to some of the more well-known and overcrowded alternatives in the East End brunch scene.",

    "text": "Other than the fact that you're probably always in for a wait because it's a popular albeit small local cafe, there is little to dislike about Cafe on Main.     First off, there are complimentary mimosas on weekends.  Secondly, the food is fabulous.    Their home fries are crunchy and toasted on the outside but soft on the inside.   They always have innovative specials on the chalkboard in addition to their main menu.   From lemon ricotta Belgium waffles to omelettes filled with items ranging from avocado to sun dried tomatoes, you are in for a treat.   The food is cooked perfectly, priced reasonably and there is plenty of it.   What more could you want?  Also, the gentleman who serves as host on weekends is a treat.  Chatty, social and just a little quirky, he makes your experience fun and interesting.",

    "text": "(I sorta don't want to let the secret out...)  Cafe on Main is a Sharpsburg breakfast joint with a local schmocal feel , and that is why I give it 2 thumbs up.  I love a place where you feel comfortable.  The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in your own dining room having a meal with your long lost relatives.  Strangers chat like family and everyone says \"Hello\"  You are greeted with a feature board that always has sweet and savory items prepared for the day.  They have an open kitchen set up, so you can see items being cooked and the chef always gives you a smile.    Oh yeah, lets talk about the food.  There is so much of it and it is so good.  Everything is always so fresh, hot and made to order.  Eggs are perfectly cooked and the ciabatta is a great compliment to any meal.  I, personally, am excited that grits are an option for a side.  I had my go-to corned beef hash and over easy eggs.  I couldn't even finish it with my side of bread and grits.  A lot of bang for your buck.  Check it out.",

Pay attention to the specials board when you walk in, they are not on the menu. There are plenty of breakfast items to choose from and will satisfy even the pickiest of eaters.  Now to the good stuff. The lemon poppy Belgian waffle was downright delicious. If I had to describe the perfect waffle this is it! So fluffy, yet crispy with just the right amount of poppy seeds and fresh fruit! Everything blended very well. Now, I'm not a huge fan of corn beef hash. However, I could eat their corn beef hash all day long. It's crispy, warm, and tastes heavenly! Lastly, their home fries. OH MY. Absolutely delicious. The crunchy outer edges were paired amazingly with the soft interior topped with the perfect blend of spices.  The food here is fantastic! Great little spot for a quick bite or for the family. Parking is easy and plenty of it. The prices are a little steep ($10 for the waffle alone), but for an every once in a while trip it's not bad. Someone did something right with this place, will definitely go back!",

The eggs were prepared fine but the hollandaise was A disappointment. It had far too much hot sauce and way too much lemon both flavors were overpowering you couldn't even taste the creamy butter notes.  My eggs were served with four small potato pancakes which were quite greasy, Although they did come with a side of applesauce which amounted to about a teaspoon.  I was not offered a refill on my coffee which was OK since it was really not very good coffee to begin with.  No bargains to be had here, 2 breakfasts ...$35 with tip.",

    "text": "that feeling that you get when you realize that there's a hair in the food that you just put in your mouth? After finding an eyelash on your plate, and your husband finds a hair on his? Isn't that bad enough? Would you expect an accusation, and nasty questions, and lack of concern from the manager?   Imagine how shocked we were when her first question as she approached our table was \"so you want to get a free meal?\"!!!!!! We had earlier quietly and politely mentioned the hair and the eyelash to our server.  We added that we would continue to eat our meal - we just wanted her to be aware. Not a huge deal (well, KIND of a big deal actually, it turned out) - don't need the manager. It's a nice place, obviously very popular, shit happens sometimes. but THEN, I had a bite of my husband's grits from across the table and dear God almighty - I had to untangle a big old hair from inside my mouth! The server brought the manager over at that point. This is what we heard from her: * \"sometimes it's the customer's own hair\" - well my husband is completely bald, and since the bowl was across the table from me, it was NOT my hair. Nor was it the color of my own hair.  * \"what would you think i can do about it?\" and  *\" we meet industry standards.\" and  *\"I don't see an eyelash\" (I'd put it on a white napkin) and  *\"oh, you call that an eyelash?\", and  *\" there's always a chance of something like this happening.\" and then, ironically,  *\"this has never happened here before.\" and  *\"no one ELSE has ever complained\" and  \"so you think I should comp your meal?\" (not an offer to comp it, or discount it or offer a gift card for us to come back - which we definitely will not do anyway)  We refused the \"offer, not an offer\"  of a comped meal, politely paid our $35 lunch tab and left - and i sat in the car shaking. Why was I  shaking when it was ME that had a big old hair in my mouth, and someone's eyelash on my plate!?  I was shaking because of the way we were treated -- Sadly, this is a very popular spot - lines out the door sometimes - so I don't guess that this review will mean anything, but let it just be a warning that you should check your plate and your  food for hairs before you put food into your mouth. not 1, not 2, but THREE hairs.  I can STILL feel that YUCK feeling several hours later - the feeling you get when you have a hair in your mouth that your fingers can't quite find and it gets tangled in your tongue and you just really try really hard not to gag! it's sad - the food was good and the choices appealing.  A simple matter of some concern shown by the manager would have gone a long way to improve the VERY unpleasant, and obviously concerning situation.",

    "text": "If you like to crow then this is the place for it. Cafe on Main has in the vicinity of about 59 roosters throughout the place. Although I came here late I wanted to try lunch as opposed to breakfast. Breakfast is served here all day. The cafe is small and very charming. They will seat you and I was able to get a spot with a view looking outside. Before entering the main dining room they have a chalkboard with today's specials.  Since I didn't want a heavy lunch I opted for a salad with mandarin oranges, blue cheese, cranberries and topped with fresh cooked chicken breast. I had a very friendly waitress who helped me with the menu. I ordered and had my salad fairly fast! It is a huge size but light enough not to overwhelm.  The chicken was fresh along with the salad and was indeed very good. It come with ciabatta bread for dipping or with butter.  I inquired about the roosters only to learn that people started donating them to this cafe. You are asked to take your check to the cash register to pay and although you can use cards to pay your check they prefer cash tips due to credit card fees. While I was paying I noticed the desserts and was told they are also homemade. I purchased a coconut macaroon to go for $1.50 and ate it when I got home. It was rich and full of coconuts but the bottom of it just didn't taste right. Although the edges appeared burnt that wasn't True of the base. Still I was glad it was made in house as opposed to being brought in from elsewhere.  Cafe on Main is open primarily for breakfast, lunch, and brunch. They close mid afternoon. Prices are reasonable for the quantity of food served. They gave me a menu to take home which is available for all in the event I want to return and try breakfast.  Located on Main St in the Sharpsburg business district, inexpensive metered street parking is available.",

When you walk in, they'll usually take your name down right away though today they had the same person taking names and checking folks out so it was rather chaotic. A big caveat here is that on Sundays they only serve breakfast, not sure about Saturdays. That was a little bit of a letdown. They have lots of specials, omelets seem to be their big specialty. The service is good here and despite how busy it was, the food came out very quickly. Their potatoes are fantastic though a side of potatoes is really enough for 2 people, they're huge. I had the French toast which was fine. The bread they use is great, lots of Ciabatta. Overall, a great spot a bit off the beaten path.",

    "text": "Stumbled on this place, thanks to a quick Yelp search and we found a winner. The place has been around for a bit and it looks it, but that is not a bad thing at all. Walk in to a fairly small space to wait, and chances are you will be waiting 10-15 minutes for a table if you show up on the weekends. A nice older woman will be ready to take your name down and you can stand around or sit at the small bench while you wait to dine. They have a couple small tops in the corners facing the street and one 4 top sitting awkwardly in the middle of the room. If the place is busy, they will not seat this table. It's a good idea to just remove it in my opinion. The back room has a dozen tables, mainly 4 tops, with a handful of 2 tops along the perimeter, which is where we were seated. A very nice woman approached to get us coffee and took our order in less than a couple minutes, which was great, since we were pressed for time, but did not make her aware of this. Coffee in our hands within a minute and orders taken. I decided on the Bruschetta Eggs Benedict and it was fantastic. Served on a large piece of sourdough was a nice change. The eggs themselves were presented almost over easy, but were formed in cylinder shape, so you can call it slightly undercooked benedict-style if that makes any sense (see pic). Super runny and not very firm, but I do like over easy, so not a huge issue for me. Fresh ingredients of tomato, basil, mozz. and arugula really made this dish a winner. Huge portions with roasted red potatoes on the side with a hint of rosemary.  Coffee wasn't super strong, but was not your typical diner coffee and our waitress came back to offer up their cinnamon-heavy snickerdoodle coffee as a warm up and it was a nice tough to finish things off. $34 and change for my wife and I, so not cheap eats, but it kept us satisfied until well into the late afternoon. What a find. Highly recommend.  Note: this place is old-skool, so bring cash just in case. Their internet went down, so I was asked to pay cash. There was an ATM right across the street, so not a huge ordeal, and our waitress was super apologetic, which was very nice and not necessary.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my breakfast at Cafe On Main.  I ordered from the specials menu and had the... \"Mr. Tom\" Turkey Benedict. Which was homemade stuffing, roast turkey, cranberry sauce, and poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce. It was delicious! One of my all-time favorites. However, the people at my table who ordered the breakfast sandwiches were underwhelmed. The sandwiches were small(ish) with ciabatta bread... the bread was really hard, once toasted, and it didn't come with a side dish. So they weren't as happy with their meal as I was.  My brother just moved to Sharpsburg, so I foresee myself eating here again.",

I know for a fact they use rotten moldy produce and just cut away the \"bad\" part and still serve it. They have served food that has been dropped on the floor. And on top of that the kitchen is infested with roaches and rats.... On another note the owner is one of rudest people i have ever met. She treats customers and employees horrible. I have witnessed her actually tell people to leave because they are taking up the table for to long. And has told employees to not give customers anymore coffee so they wont stay any longer. The owner also keeps a portion of the hard working servers tips!!!  If the food didnt taste as good as it does she would have been out of business long ago. Please go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Still great food but extremely disgusted with the attitude of some of the staff. Our server was very kind and on top of it but the older gentleman and woman hostess(I think his wife)were beyond rude today. We had a friend running pretty late and being familiar with their policy of your entire party needing to be present before you can be seated, didn't want to hold us up and so told us to go ahead and eat without her- she would just pop in to say hello but wasn't going to order anything. After changing the number of people in our party to 2 and being reminded from the elderly hostess that our friend couldn't order anything if she ended up coming...we were seated. A couple of minutes after our food came, our friend arrived. The older woman who sat us took it upon herself to come up to us and once again \"make sure she wasn't going to hold up our table\" ... we weren't even halfway done eating and our tardy friend had assured the woman upon her arrival that she wouldn't order anything and even turned down the coffee/water that was offered from our server. There were also several empty tables around us which was strange as we didn't understand why they were making other customers wait to be seated while focusing on rushing us out when we clearly weren't finished with our meals and there was plenty of open seating available. We then noticed the older woman and gentleman pointing at us and whispering. Embarrassed and uncomfortable, I decided that I had to say something before we left and when I did, instead of an apology I got even more attitude about how WE made THEM feel uncomfortable by adding another person to our party who wasn't on \"the list.\" We weren't at the table for more than 2 minutes after I finished and set my fork down because of how uncomfortable we were from them staring and hovering over us. I would have loved to take my time eating/finish my coffee or get a refill (god forbid) but we were too uncomfortable to stay any longer. I feel bad for the rest of the staff because they do a nice job and the food is delicious. You lost 3 customers today. What a shame.",

    "text": "This was our second visit, as we had stopped back in April for brunch and were highly impressed. In fact, of all the diners we have visited, it was arguably our favorite. Unfortunately, this time it wasn't quite as good.   First of all, I don't know if the A/C was broken, but it was very warm inside with little air circulation. On top of that, the waitress took a while to get our drink order, so I was nearly sweating before I had my first sip of water.  I went with the Tuscan Omelet, which surprisingly was a little bland. The ciabatta toast, however, was fantastic and the fruit was fresh. My wife's eggs were poached perfectly and her raisin toast was great, as well. She only had a minor complaint in that the side of fruit, while good, wasn't that large. They were busy enough that they had a busboy dedicated to filling people's drinks, so we never wanted for more coffee or water.  Since our first visit was so great, I will chalk this one up to just a bad day at the office. We will definitely be back I am sure, if for nothing else at least to order their ciabatta toast again.",

When a table was ready, we were asked if we were okay with the table at the corner of the waiting area. With all the sunlight coming in from the window behind it and our stomachs growling, we said of course. There was even a hook next to the table for our jackets! I got the corned beef hash with egg and potato pancakes. Yum! Very oily, but hey it's breakfast. Boyfriend got steak, eggs, and home fries. He was annoyed that part of his egg was placed on the handle of his steak knife when it was served to him because it made the handle oily. Other than that, everything was good. Would return!

    "text": "Overall: Awesome breakfast cooking, but service attitude left much to be desired. We felt rushed at the end and miffed with the overall dining experience.  This place has really awesome food, if you are willing to accept the somewhat aloof server attitude...  * Norwegian Benedict: Fantastic combo of perfectly golden poached eggs and smoked salmon, covered with a smooth hollandaise sauce that has just the right tartness and creaminess, delightfully paired with a small bowl of fresh fruit. $11. * Malibu Omelette: Hearty portion of scrambled eggs wrapping generous slices of avocado, mushroom, and spinach, paired sumptuously with delicious home fries. $10. * Pancake: Yum! $3 for a single. * Breakfast Sandwich: Very tasty set of scrambled eggs, cheese, and thick slice of ham held loosely between buttered and lightly toasted ciabatta bread. $5.  * Coffee: bland and served in an overly small cup (6 oz?!), with refills slightly difficult to come by. $3. * Hot chocolate: bland, despite being specially made and blended to kid's temperature. $3.  ----  What follows is borderline TMI on why we felt dissatisfied with the service we received.  Depending on your familiarity with the staff, YMMV, so take it with a grain of salt and a light heart.  If you are the establishment reading this, I hope it helps you in a constructive manner to figure out how add new clientele, or at least make the present clientele dine more happily.  Perhaps this *is* the Sharpsburg of Pittsburgh.  Perhaps it's been a tough year.  Perhaps we were just too different, too out of place.  Perhaps the servers have had a tough morning, what with the rain n'at.  Whatever the cause, we felt neglected from the moment we entered the cafe door into an ordering area bordering a fully-staffed kitchen of 5: no greetings, barely an acknowledgment despite my radiant smile to convey that, \"We came in peace, and very hungry!\"  The sign into the dining area told us to wait to be seated, so we did.  More than 5 minutes later, a managing lady finally came out to ask how many we had, and proceeded to get a table ready by cleaning up a just-eaten table, when we could see two other unoccupied tables.  She at least asked if we needed a high chair for the baby.  In contrast to the rest of the staff, server Lisa was much more attentive and all smiles. She came by with a drawing board for our older child, asked if he wanted crayons instead, and also to ask if we got our drinks ordered while the main server was busy elsewhere.  She brightened our day!  When the main server finally came by, other than one chitchat comment about our baby being adorable, she plainly asked for our drink order, to which we responded that we'd already given it...perhaps that's when it went south.  After our drinks were brought to us, she asked if we were ready to order; we told her we were, at which point she left to tend to other tables, only to come back a few minutes later to ask again if we were ready to order.  Our main server seemed less than patient and barely attentive when my wife was ordering.  In any case, by the time we placed our order, at least 15 minutes had transpired from our initial entry.  Food preparation took place quite promptly, and we had food on our table in a little under 10 minutes.  Very soon after we had seated, while we waited, my wife began feeding the little one, a process that usually took 15 minutes.  So when our food arrived, we were able to focus and eat, tending to the snack needs of the little one occasionally when he screamed a bit.  If the occasional screams bothered the staff or other patrons, they only protested with, \"Aw, what a cute baby!\"  Partway through our munching, the main server came by with our check, which seemed fairly normal.  However, what followed didn't seem quite the norm to us.  In short, less than half an hour from when we got our food, our main server came by to collect payment, saying something to the effect that a party of 9 was waiting outside and that her manager just wanted to close out transactions.  No kidding?!  We were not entirely finished with our food; and I'd only had ONE coffee refill, nothing close to the 300mg caffeine I required to operate.  I looked at a nearby 6-person table whose 2-party patron was nearly done.  I was a bit miffed at being rushed.  So while I took out my payment, I told our server that I felt a bit rushed.  She asked for my tip due to my card having a chip (really?!?!), and then told us that we could take our time, keeping in mind that the 9 are waiting.  Not wanting to keep a crowd more than twice our headcount waiting in severe hunger, we quickly up'd and left, with no intentions of coming back, however mouthwatering my favorite benedict.  Really, the server could have waited a few more minutes; I also would have happily paid at the counter.  In my model of restaurant service, this experience deserved a one star, had server Lisa not been there, and if not for the delicious cooking.",
