    "text": "This is the kind of place where you're served coffee before anything else. Your placemat is your menu, and the temperature control is questionable. But the sausage omelette features meat from schwartz's market. The ham is freshly sliced off the tinfoil-covered-baked-ham behind the counter. You'll watch your breakfast cooked behind the counter, so you don't have to ask the waitress any details, not that she'd tell you anyways.   My favorite part of O'Leary's is the decor. It's a long narrow restaurant and one side wall is completely taken over by street art. You have the requisite South Side tin ceiling, and there's always tunes playing on the mini-boombox.   The only real drawback of O'Leary's is the regulars. They eye you a bit funny when you first walk in the door. They turn out to be pretty harmless though.",

Simple fair like bacon and eggs, pancakes, a couple of omelets for breakfast are on the menu, and so are basics like a hamburger, cheeseburger, ham sandwich, BLT, and a steak hoagie for lunch. I think I literally just listed 90% of what they had on the menu. I sat at the counter and ordered a BLT ($4.50) and a turner's iced tea ($0.75).  The BLT was made fresh and it was tasty (bacon crisp, lettuce crisp, tomato freshly sliced). Simple food for affordable prices with friendly staff.",

    "text": "I've probably walked by this place dozens if not hundreds of times.  For some reason I always thought it was closed because you can't really see inside.  But one morning, after working overnight, some friends and I decided to give it a try.  If nothing else, we could wander on over to Jack's for cocktails if O'Leary's was a bust.  Okay, sure, we did end up at Jack's.  But not before enjoying a delicious breakfast at O'Leary's first.  The two ladies behind the counter work together beautifully to take and put together orders.  I was quite impressed with their efficiency.  My friends ordered omelets and breafast sandwiches while I ordered the breakfast burrito.  I had to, it's my thing.  If I see a breakfast burrito on a menu, I have to try it.  The choice of meats includes your typical: bacon, hot or sweet sausage, ham....but also kielbasa.  So I just had to try the kielbasa filled breakfast burrito.  You can look at my picture to see that, okay, technically the tortilla was not folded over completely.  But it still had all the ingredients inside and was topped with salsa and sour cream.  The biggest surprise was the fact that they use mango salsa.  I was shocked to find mango salsa in a place like this, and then I became very pleased.  The waitress asked me if I enjoyed it and I told her I most certainly did.  I was shocked to find out that this burrito is a new item on their menu.  I hope it stays there.    My friends also enjoyed their selections.  I believe I heard, \"This could be the best breakfast I've ever had\" come out of one of them.  The spectacle behind the counter and the friendly service only made everything that much better.  We all agreed we will return.  If only to try the grits and use the coupon I forgot I had in my wallet.",

It's kind of chaotic, but the breakfast is hot and filling. One quibble, I ordered the Deluxe French Toast that comes encrusted with cornflakes and was so looking forward to it. I got the regular French Toast... Which was good, but not as good as I imagine the Deluxe version was. My husband got the hot sausage omelet much to his liking. We will definitely be coming back here for a quick, hot, and cheap breakfast next time we are up early enough on a Saturday b/f it gets packed. Best to go 1st thing in the morning. Any later than 10 and you may have wait awhile. Plus, which by 10, do yourself a favor and go to brunch!",

    "text": "We stumbled upon O'Leary's on a Sunday morning literally seconds after I finished a diatribe about the South Side's lack of breakfast options.  My BF and I had made the mistake of attempting a Piper's brunch after 11 am only to find a 1 hour wait and stomachs left wanting.  We were walking down Carson St. looking for an alternative and almost walked by this place, as many of other reviewers have said it is easy to miss it despite the yellow paint adorning the building.  A quick check on Yelp and we decided to give it a try.  We immediately found an empty table and were greeted by a server who took our order for coffees and water.  The coffee arrived and it was hot and somewhat decent for your run of the mill diner.  We both went with the mixed grill, his with bacon and mine with kielbasa (they do get kudos for having this as a meat option) and toast.  After a short wait and some attentive coffee service our food arrived, and our table equipped with ketchup and chipotle tobasco.  I could pour that hot sauce over anything and it would taste great, but I suspect that my dish still would have been good without it.  All of the ingredients were fresh and nothing was greasy.  However, when the server brought our food out she let us know that the toast did not come with the mixed grill but we could add it for a charge.  What savory breakfast of egg, meat, and taters does not come with toast along side it?  I really shouldn't gripe, our two coffees, entrees, toast, and the water that never came (minus another point) filled us up and came to a total of $20.  But charging extra for a couple pieces of bread when you are already charging $8 for potatoes and egg with a few veggies and pieces of meat?  Overall the food was good and if I lived in the South Side I would definitely head back here, but there is nothing here I can't find at my own neighborhood breakfast spots (with the toast included!).",

    "text": "Quaint little place.  Small menu with reasonable prices.  I REALLY like this diner.  It is as unpretentious as you can get and they make their French toast from scratch.  That's right, you read that properly.  They make every order of French toast from scratch and to order.  It is not taken out of the freezer like so many other places.  Coupled with the fact that it actually tastes good, I have found my new favorite breakfast place.  They don't do poached eggs, but the fried eggs are not greasy and always cooked properly -- so I can let this slide.  Items that we have ordered here: French Toast Eggs, over easy Bacon Sausage Ham Pancakes Steak and Cheese sandwich Homefries Hot Sausage patty  There are only two things that really haven't been that great here (in my opinion): the hot sausage patty and the steak and cheese sandwich.  I am not a fan of fennel, which is why I don't care for the sausage patty.  As for the steak and cheese, I can get a better tasting one at other Pittsburgh locales; doesn't taste bad, though.  Do not expect to go in on a weekend and have a long conversation with the people working behind the counter; they are slammed and it shows in their no-nonsense attitude toward everyone.  They are congenial but always straight to the point.  Not once did I see this mother-daughter duo stop to rest.  They were cooking machines.  This is one of the big draws for me.  Watching these two ladies work seamlessly as they create a little dish of deliciousness for everyone.  From making the French toast, to the fresh home fries, to the freshly baked and carved ham that they use.  You can see that love that goes into what they cook.   The only downside is the parking situation.  It is the standard Carson Street quandry: finding that coveted parking space on the main drag or on one of the side streets.  It is well worth it, especially if you like French toast.  I will be returning and returning and returning....",

Although I walked by this place many times on Carson, I had never noticed it or recognized it was a restaurant. Upon entering it is easy to notice the place is pretty bare with only a few booths and a few bar seats.  It was staffed by two older women and a younger girl who were friendly but noticeably busy.  Impressive was the sign on the wall celebrating 20 years of business, totally a testament to the hard work of those women.  As soon as we sat down we had a coffee and some silverware, but I doubted the cleanliness of things as the silverware felt greasy.  The overall feel of the place was like I was in somebody's house, and not a very nice one at that.  The menu is short and has just the essentials.  Like I mentioned, this feels like a person's house, so I did not stray too far from the usuals - eggs, toast, coffee.  The food was served pretty quickly and was piping hot.  While simple, it did not disappoint.  The potatoes looked pretty good, fresh cut with bunches of onions, and my friend confirmed they were indeed tasty.  While the food was good, I would have preferred a place a little more professional.  Worth a try, but I definitely will pick a different place next time.",

    "text": "It's this tiny diner with an old country feel to it, but they sure know how to do breakfast. There are plenty of seats for a small group. The service was quick and straight to the point. They definitely try to keep it simple and real.   I ordered the kielbasa and egg sandwich. The portion was just right. The acidity from the mustard sauce added a pleasant surprise and bread had a nice crisp to it. The menu stated that the sandwich will be on Texas toast, but I think they just used regular sandwich slices. I was a little disappointed about that part, but other than that my kielbasa sandwich was tasty!   This place really knows how to do breakfast right at the right price. I really appreciate that they keep it simple, but yet delicious. I'm tired of those over the top and excessively extravagant breakfast places in Pittsburgh. It's refreshing to stumble upon a quaint little mom and pop breakfast diner like this one. I highly recommend!",

Their hot sausage patty is the best around ; and they actually take the time to nicely brown their home-fry potatoes.     I agree with other reviewers, it'd be nice if they weren't just \"cash only\" ; but that may help keep the prices low, which by the way are very reasonable.    This is just one of those places, that if it ever closes, would be missed A LOT !",

But then the lack of anyone else working and the incredibly dingy bathrooms keeps this place from 5 stars.  I came in one morn and was pleasantly greeted by the Manager/Chef/Server/Check out girl/Prep cook and who only knows what else this lady does.  She quickly gave me some coffee and asked for my order.  I was killing some time, so I told her no hurry, as I glanced at the menu.  A steak and egg bagel for $5.  Almost too good to be True.  Although weary, it was pretty great.  Got some hash browns as well.  Was thinking 5 stars all the way.  Then I went to the bathroom.  They are dealing with tight space and i get it.  And as a place mostly frequented by locals, who probably just use their own.  But wow, down a flight of stairs shouldn't be legal.  And man it was dingy when I got down there.  I just chose not to use it.  Bottom line, stop in for a quick breakfast, but don't drink too much coffee.",

The bacon is thick and the potato's are sliced right there behind the counter before being tossed on the grill to become home fries.  It doesn't appear that any corners are cut.  The portions are large too... have breakfast here in the morning and there's no need to schedule lunch.  O'Leary's is about as good as it gets for a working class breakfast.

    "text": "So when the other reviewers say greasy spoon, they are not being poetic.  Not only is this place visibly dirty, old bacon on the floor, sticky layer of something on the chairs, wads of gray napkins used as a wedge under the booth, but it also has a pervasive smell of cooking grease that invades your personal space as soon as you walk in.  So, if you've recently had a blowout...keep your distance.   That being said, I had the MOST DELICIOUS EGG SANDWICH EVER.  I got a sausage egg and cheese to go.  In NYC we get egg sandwiches on rolls so I didn't know what to substitute.  The cook/waitress expertly steered me to the English muffin option.  In NYC we have diner links that they split and fry and plop on an egg. they often fall out and land on the floor if you're not careful.  At O'Leary's I was treated to a sausage patty the size of a small hamburger...perfectly flavored and featuring just the right amount of salt to wake me up in the morning.  Egg was both crispy and runny and the cheese was gooey and delicious.  In NYC, I'm going to be craving this breakfast treat! Cash only.",

The table was cleaned spotless and the waitress came right over and got drink orders. Waitress brought our drink orders and took our orders. I had a #2 special 2 eggs over easy and bacon and home fries well done with white toast and to drink I had a hot chocolate with marshmallows and whip cream. The service was fantastic and waitress was very friendly. My food was delicious and eggs cooked perfectly. The prices are really good compared to other diners.

Place is small only a couple booths and counter seating so I don't suggest coming during busy times unless you want to wait.  Cash only! Place is surprisingly warm, wherever I go, I am always cold. But I ended up taking off two layers.  There wasn't a booth immediately open when I got there but I waited at the counter seats then moved on over.  Service staff very friendly about it.  Came to take drink order once the full party was seated.  I got a hot chocolate.  Came with whipped cream and marshmallows.  They had a sign that said chicken noodle soup was the soup of the day but they were all out when I tired to order it :( So for my meal I ended up ordering grits, cheesy home fries, and turkey bacon.  It is hard to find breakfast spots with turkey bacon so once I saw that on the menu I was already excited.  Everything was very delicious.  Definitely a happy customer. Just a heads up when you are ready to leave, pay at the counter, they don't bring a check over.  We were first timers so we didn't know.  The lady at the counter apologized.  It was totally okay and know we know for next time.  Overall: friendly staff and cheap tasty diner food.",

I definitely would not have given this place even 1 star, if 0 was an option.   Things were totally fine at first and food started coming out pretty shortly after we ordered, but after the first 3 things came out nothing came for over an hour. Our server finally checked in on us and we told him we were missing almost all of our food. MEANWHILE we watched countless to go orders and all of the tables around us get food.  Once the food arrived it was pretty much what you'd expect from a diner breakfast.   Because we waited so long we expected something to make up for their error. We know things happen, but having 4/6 people working in food service before, we all knew what should have happened. When we asked if they were going to do anything we got lots of rude remarks about how we should have told them and that it wasn't their fault. News flash: you own a restaurant, your job is to be attentive to your customers. They also decided it would be a good idea at this point to tell us that our server doesn't actually work for them and that they were understaffed and that \"service can't be perfect every time\". None of us were asking for perfect service, the fact is that the service we got was FAR from perfect and they had nothing but excuses, sarcasm and rudeness.   Needless to say, I'm never spending my money at an establishment that treats their customers that way again, and you shouldn't either.",

I'm so glad it came up on my stroll while in the area. I'm more than pleased with the food, the services and the prices were all phenomenal. I went alone this time but I will be back with my family. Home cooking was just what I needed to soothe my soul today.  The staff was very friendly and very courteous to all the guests who entered. Hats off to the chef. Very well done.",

    "text": "Found this place from all the great reviews.  We walked in and it was full.  No problem.  We stood and waited.  No one ever greeted us or let us know if it was a first come first serve seating and to seat ourselves or wait for them to seat us. No problem. After the first booth opened up,  a two-top immediately got up from their table and took the booth.  Having 4 in our party, we still continued to stand and wait.  Then a booth opened up so we immediately took it before someone else would take it from us, like what happened 2 min before.  So then we sit at a messy booth for a couple minutes.  No problem. The server comes over and starts cleaning up the booth.  Cleans it without ever looking at any of the 4 of us or speaking to us even though he is just like inches from our faces.  Cleans it and walks off, not a look, not a word.  If we weren't already feeling unwelcome, the sarcastic handwritten signs on the walls are a nice touch.  \"We love it when you sit down at a dirty booth\"  \"If you call us 10 times and the phone just rings, please call 10 more times\"   Food that i was able to see other people being served looked delicious.  Looked top notch.  I left after being the only group waiting in this hole in the wall with like 6 booths and a small bar top, just standing around by the door, hoping an employee there can muster up the leadership skills to give me some kind of direction on how to spend money at their establishment.  Maybe you're a local and you know who runs this so it's all good for you.  And im just a tourist that travels to pittsburgh regularly and spends money.    But really.... What restaurant puts signs up about what they don't like about their customers?   Seriously.   The food must be THAT good.",

Coming from Toronto where food can be over priced and your hungry an hour later, not to mention staff going through the motions....O'Learys is a fantastic little greasy spoon that's family owned. Simple menu- fresh coffee, huge portions and reasonable prices.    I ordered 2 eggs over easy, with bacon and home fries and toast. Bacon was enormous- perfectly crisp- eggs were cooked just right ( and I don't often find eggs done right)-  Bf ordered a veggie omelette that took up half the plate with home fries and toast.   It was all delicious and I kid you not we were still stuffed came lunch and only needed dinner!    If you want fancy and upscale don't come here. If you only have plastic hit up an ATM.   Although it was not our first choice I am really glad we ate there.  And would 100% go back.",

I'm not from Pittsburgh, and getting a breakfast for one let alone 2 for $11 is unheard of in Jersey.  I got the light with the eggs sunny side up and white toast, me eggs were cooked to perfection and I had just enough toast to mop everything up.  My wife got eggs n nat with scrambled eggs, white toast and home fries. She said her eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were done to perfection.  We both had orange juices which were bottles of Tropicana which were fine.  The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. It definitely seems like a place where the folks in the neighborhood are regulars and I can see why.  Next time we need breakfast in Pittsburgh we'll be sure to head there.",

    "text": "You want a greasy spoon diner? O'Leary's is a good place to start. The owners/cooks are sisters (I think), and you can tell they really enjoy what they do. They joke around with the customers and never miss a beat with the food. No thrills or fancy decor. Also, I think our server may still have been drunk from the night before, but it's all good, we don't judge. We still enjoyed ourselves. I ordered a spinach, feta, and tomato omelet, and watched as they pulled the fresh spinach and feta from the fridge - as in, an old school white fridge your grandma has in her kitchen (well, it used to be white at one point - more yellow now). The food was good, cheap, and fresh. The only complaint would be a lack of air conditioning. Thank goodness it was a little chilly outside, because even with the economy-sized fan, there is little air circulation.",

I'll sit and sweat a bit just for one of their delicious omelets and yummy home fries or their savory, tasty hamburgers and HOME MADE potato salad that tastes just like mom's (or mine!) Five stars because the food is what I came for and the food is what I'm rating. Yes, it's greasy--I smelled the food in my clothes and hair all day--and yes, it's hot inside--a good ventilation system and a/c would be awesome but--I'd rather have great food at awesome prices and that's what they delivered! VERY personable waitperson and the cooks (owners) were very kind and attentive to everyone's needs. LOVE this place!!!",
