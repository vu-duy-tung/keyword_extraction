I can't stand most Chinese restaurants as they all have sweet sauce and too many vegetables for my liking. However, I'll go to Ka Mei 6 days a week as they have a large menu and the food is the most  authentic Chinese in Pittsburgh and their prices are reasonable too.",

The restaurant has very basic decor but VERY cozy.  My family and I ordered the pigs feet, black pepper tofu, pan friend noodles vegetarian style, and salt and pepper squid.  The portions were generous and the flavors were just right ;balanced without being overly salty or greasy (which is hard when trying to get that \"wok\" fire taste).  They accidentally made the vegetarian noodles with chicken, but the owner was so nice and apologetic about the situation, she quickly had another order made and didn't charge us.  Even my picky Asian parents approved which is huge!  Definitely a great find in Pittsburgh.  Plus it's a BYOB.",

(although, they could have cut up the preserved egg a little more).  Pea shoots were a little over salted, but those are so delicious that I don't care how I get it.  We also had gong chao ngo ho (that's beef with wide noodles), which was good, but the sauce was a little on the sweet side.  Too bad that they don't have fresh roast Chinese meats.  But whatever.

A well made bowl of congee is my ideal comfort food, especially since we're having this interminable winter.  And my conclusion? Well... maybe my expectation was too high.  I thought it a bit too much on the thin and watery side.  And since they charge $7 for it, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a bit more pork as well.    A basic congee is not hard to make. Any proud owner of a Japanese fuzzy logic rice cooker can do it at home. What I miss, though, is that full bodied richness that comes from a balanced mix of the piping hot porridge, the slippery preserved eggs and the flavorful pork bits. I don't have the knack to get the balance right, but apparently, neither does Ka Mei. Still, the next time I'm down with a cold, I'll be forking over my $7 for another bowl.",

The preserved egg was a little odd (never had such a thing before) but quite good; the pork was delicious; and the congee was a bit bland, but not bad. (NB: I don't know what a \"typical\" congee is supposed to taste like, so I'm not sure whether they're supposed to be relatively bland or not.)   For the chicken with bitter melon, the chicken tasted fairly typical of a Chinese restaurant, but the bits of ginger were a surprise. The bitter melon was overpowering to my tastes- I had several pieces, but couldn't acclimate to it. I can't really justify docking any stars for that, though, since these were brand new tastes for me.",

Once she realized that I spoke Cantonese she proceeded to ask me when I immigrated to the United States (I answered), whom I came with (I answered) , how come my father didn't come with us (...), and were my parents divorced and that's why my father didn't come with us (I didn't answer. I just had that blank look). I am a 30+ year old woman, so it's a bit weird to have a stranger asking about my family background. It's a lot more information than I would like to share considering that I just wanted some lunch. I agree with another reviewer that she did not treat her servers very well. On one occasion, she yelled at the server for working too slowly in front of other customers, and we were a bit uncomfortable with that scene. Other than that, the food is fine. I would recommend takeouts to minimize interactions, haha.",

    "text": "Okay the best way for me to gauge if I want to enter an Asian establishment  is if the clientele is Asian. Ka Mei definitely is often packed with Chinese customers.   There are two different menus: one that is more conventional Chinese and another that is more specifically Cantonese/Hong Kong style. The great thing is, the food here is \"authentic\", which I think is important for me since I can cook inauthentic Chinese style food at home. Or if need be, I can go to a mall food court and get \"Chinese\" food. The distinction is important, bec. the Americanized Chinese food is usually deep fried and heavily sauced.   At any rate, the food here is good. I won't say it's the best Chinese food I've had, but for Pittsburgh I would say it comes closest to authentic Chinese restaurants in other cities with larger Chinese communities.   BTW, congee is supposed to be bland. It's often times what you feed people when they are sick. It would be considered an Asian \"comfort\" food. And you add soy sauce and other seasonings to your taste.  Unlike other reviewers, I wouldn't recommend the cold chicken, I don't think they do it that well. The congee is okay. If you don't feel like taking a risk, the beef chow fan is always good.",

    "text": "I wanted to look for more authentic Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh and when someone recommended Ka Mei to me, a Hong Kong styled cuisine, I figured I should give it a try. The nice thing is that they have pictures of almost all their dishes plastered up on the wall if we wanted some visual idea of what we were to order and there's Chinese on their menu too. The owner also speaks both Cantonese and Mandarin. Unfortunately, when we went on a Friday night, the place was horribly understaffed with only one cook (most likely the owner) and one waiter. And since they serve on a table-by-table process, the food for us, a party of 8 took almost an hour to completely arrive. At least we had tea to keep our stomachs from growling too loudly.  Once the food arrived, I guess I expected more authentic Chinese cooking. The beef and chicken was steamed and looked like one of the healthy options you would choose off a separate menu. They had a nice variety of Chinese styled vegetables though and a very wide Asian drink selection. My regret is that I should have looked at some of the pictures before ordering because some of the dishes were surprisingly simple. Such as the shrimp & eggs for $10, which was literally a couple of shrimps put inside an egg omelet. I'm not quite sure how authentic that is...  The decor was simple. There were just a couple of tables for sit-down eating and only two tables that could accommodate large parties of either 6 or 8. It is also BYOB which I didn't discover until another party brought in a couple bottles of wine. I'm not sure what the corkage fee is though, if there is any.  The establishment is CASH ONLY and there's also a public parking lot with quartered meters behind the restaurant.",

She and I were both terrified because it still looked alive, and we're not into looking at food that looks like it's looking at you.  My dad said it was delicious, though.

The hot & sour soup was fairly spicy and is a good deal. The wonton soup was also tasty with a flavorful broth and big wontons. The egg rolls were decent but not too crispy. The crab rangoons were pretty bland and boring and all you can taste is the cream cheese. The big problem was the quality of the entrees. Maybe we made a mistake with what we ordered but we didn't have a single decent entree. The chicken in garlic sauce didn't taste like garlic at all. All we could taste was a mild ginger flavor. The General Tso's chicken had a standard sauce and the pieces of chicken were big but the soggy breading was unsightly and I had to peel it off. The Kung Pao chicken tasted like spicy chicken soup. And last but not least, the beef with broccoli had no flavor whatsoever. All in all, a sad experience and I'll continue my search for half decent Chinese food in Pittsburgh.",

When you eat the pieces of deliciously battered squid, make sure to get a piece of jalepeno pepper with it for maximum flavour!

Today when I went in to pick up my order, there were two other customers waiting for their orders. The place was very busy, and the owner was handling a lot of stuff in the kitchen. I paid for my order, grabbed the bag, and as I was walking out, I heard the other two customers talking about the picture menu the restaurant has on its wall. They were trying to puzzle through a dish that was there, and I offered one idea since I had had chinese broccoli before. Out of nowhere I feel (and hear) a smack on my butt! I wish I could say I was joking here, but obviously the owner thought I was saying something wrong, because she had run past the counter and smacked me square on the ass (I guess as if you would spank a child?). She then pointed to the bag in my hand, the door, and only said \"your order is ready.\" No other explanation. Dumbfounded at something I didn't ever foresee happening while I picked up some takeout, I just left.  I am a frequent customer, but I don't think I've reached a level of familiarity with any restaurant owner such that I would be comfortable being spanked. If it was done in jest, it was done so in very, very poor taste. I am sad now because I really enjoy their food, but don't ever feel comfortable returning. It goes to 0 stars for the battery, but gains 1 back because the food really is delicious. Good lord.",

Kay wanted Asian food Friday evening, and when Kay wants Asian food, she gets Asian food, so to Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh's current Asian cuisine hotbed, we went.   The word \"authentic\" is one I keep seeing  in many reviews of Ka Mei and ethnic restaurants in general. I'll say as I have said in the past that I really don't know much about ethnic authenticity and have learned to care less and less about it over time. To me, If it's good, it's good, and from my gustatory perspective, Ka Mei's food was just acceptable.  It's funny how Chinese food has become so commonplace in my life. What were once exotic delicacies have now become as traditional as spaghetti to me.  Consequently, when I go to Chinese restaurants these days, I find myself at a loss regarding what to order, so on this evening I chose my meal at random.   Crab Rangoon's usually a safe bet for me, but Ka Mei's take was a little disappointing on my end. We ordered it for our appetizer and were slightly let down by its waterly, nearly crabless filling and the somewhat tough wonton that held it.   My Kung Pao Shrimp was loaded with bright, thickly chopped veggies and was not without an ample helping of portly, juicy shrimp. Something was missing, however. Aside from being sufficiently spicy, I felt the dish was deficient in savoriness. The portion was rather hearty, yet I had to force myself to finish it despite arriving with an angry stomach. It was passable, I suppose, but it failed to excite me enough to devour it in my usual ravenous fashion.   Methinks I need to institute a personal moratorium on Chinese food. Am I gettin' burned out on it? Is fatigue to blame for me being underwhelmed by Ka Mei?",

So if you're judging based solely on Pittsburgh, it's the best. But otherwise it's actually rather average.  Cantonese cuisine relies heavily on fresh ingredients and not necessarily spices... So yes you can get a Cantonese styled steam fish here... But it's made from a frozen fish. So i don't blame the chef or Ka Mei, it's just we're in Pittsburgh. I only come here when I'm feeling homesick otherwise, if you just want some Chinese food whether it's Cantonese or not, I recommend Rose Tea.  As for service, I don't usually recommend a Chinese restaurant if your main objective is service. I believe the owner is from Hong Kong. And True to the style of Hong Kong servers, she speaks to you in a familiar tone but can also be curt sometimes. Which is ok with me, like I said, I come here if I'm feeling homesick.  Ka Mei's preserved egg and pork congee is pretty decent.",

And the cold chicken was this: an unseasoned quarter chicken, white as a bare ass, and hacked into pieces.  The beef soup was edible but not noteworthy, and the pea sprouts were good, in the way that every vegetable is when you stir fry it with garlic and oil.

Bag was heavy & hot. Got home happy as hell, showered, fired up the MacBook & gorged myself on this lady's cooking. Spareribs were perfectly tender knuckles of meat that reminded me of a home cooked meal & the sauce was delicious. Noodles were a little clumpy in some parts (I forgive them cause they were in a hurry to close) but very edible & filled with generous portions of meat (chicken & that Asian red pork) & seafood. The other \"Awww, man\" moment besides the minor noodle clumps was the small carton of rice that came with the ribs. I wanted more to soak up that sauce. The dish was that good.   Like some of the other YeIpers, I had reservations about the prices but the portions are big enough for 2 (& the morning after) & it cost real money to be in a nice neighborhood like Squirrel Hill. It is well worth it to make the trek down Murray Avenue to eat at Ka Mei. Yes, the lady is eccentric in a kindly immigrant way.

If I could give this place zero stars I would. It started with a rude server. Since I could not speak mandarin she spoke exclusively to my wife with a tones and gestures that seem like she didn't want to be there. My wife did confirm to me afterwards the server was rude to her. I could have at least given them a better score if the food was good, but it wasn't, in fact I'd consider it borderline inedible. I ordered the Peking style pork ribs. Normally it is thin slices of pork with bone-on, battered, and fried to a crisp with a sweet and sour glaze over it. At this place, each piece was as thick as four pieces you would find elsewhere, it was soggy and I pretty much just ate a sweet and sour pork chop. I've had some bad versions of these before but this is by far the worst. I ordered the beef brisket hot pot with radishes. It's pretty telling when the only thing I could stomach were the radishes. I'm not big on wasting food but I didn't even bag the food home, it was that bad. I'd rather just wait till I can go to Philly or NY to get some real Cantonese food.",

As amazing as Hong Kong cuisine is, the only Hong Kong restaurant that I can compare this to, was a cheap, late night, fast food dive where most of the patrons were drunk enough to choke down the bland preparations of low quality ingredients.

Even though there were only a few other guests when I ate there, the waitress was terse, inattentive and slow, and never refilled any water or tea.  After I paid, she returned my credit card back to guests at different table.  I feel lucky they didn't walk out with my card since she only brought it back to me once they alerted her of her mistake.

I still think that it is a tad pricey overall, although for certain items the quality and/or quantity is rather worthwhile. To me, it also now seems to be less comparable to Oriental Kitchen; there's a bit of overlap, but this place feels more homely and is okay for a small quiet meal, while Oriental Kitchen is better for groups and seafood.  In particular, many of their rice plates and noodles seem to be fine choices. Their fried rice noodles with beef () is a Cantonese staple, and it was both tasty and sizable for the price. We also wanted a noodle soup but it was late and they apparently ran out of soup. Wasn't too much of a problem, so changed it to a black bean pork rib rice plate order instead. While this one could've used a little less sauce, the bell pepper and onion were fresh and the rib meat was plentiful.",

In fact, the reason I ventured in to Ka Mei was on the recommendation of a Chinese friend... A very picky Chinese friend, at that.   Like other restaurants, Ka Mei offers both American-Chinese food and authentic dishes. I've opted for the latter and have not been disappointed. Their food seems lightly seasoned and notably fresh. You can taste the different elements. I admittedly tend to prefer stronger flavors, but I appreciate Ka Mei as a change of pace. And it's the only place I know of that serves dou miao (snow pea greens) when in season.",

Bro had just been released from a two week hospital stay and I figured he could use a little cheering up.    Ka Mei has some very good authentic Hong Kongese dishes, but we went for more Americanized Chinese fare.  I guess you could call it comfort food.  We both opted for some vegetable eggrolls and some hot  & sour soup.   Paul went for shrimp with Chinese eggplant whereas I went for the chicken and garlic.  My chicken wasn't overcooked nor was the garlic overpowering.  So Ka Mei's regular menu isn't all that inspiring.  Who cares?  When you want comfort food, it fills the bill.  But I'm going have to try the Hong Kongese menu sometime.",

    "text": "As of 02/13/11, this place now accepts Credit Cards!  Discover, Mastercard, Visa, and I think American Express.  This place inside is not that big, but the decor is nice and simple.  I think the owners are Cantonese, but everyone can speak Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, so language shouldn't be a problem.  Hot tea is free, but there is also a variety of Asian drinks (Apple Sidra, Guava Juice, Super Supau, etc)  Our waitress was really nice.  She was able to give us recommendations on what to get.  She even took us to the front, where there is the wall with all the pictures of their dishes and explained what's what.  She also checked up on us frequently, asking if the dishes were to our liking (since she ended up recommending them).  My boyfriend really appreciated the customer service here.  We ended up having dou mei (vegetable), spare ribs in black bean sauce, and cha-sou pork with tofu and bok choy in this special sauce.  Dou mei was decent, a big plate of vegetables doused in that light oil sauce that you commonly see on Chinese vegetable dishes.  Spare ribs wasn't bad either, definitely had the black bean flavored infused in the meat.  Note that you're going to have to do a lot of sucking/ripping off the meat from the bones (something I'm not fond of doing, but that's what you do with spare ribs!)  I liked the pork/tofu dish!  The brown sauce was a bit thick and very flavorful.  The sauce is perfect for the tofu because the tofu just absorbs whatever sauce it's sitting in.  I thought it was funny that there are actually two separate menus.  The first one has your typical \"Americanized\" Chinese food (chicken with broccoli, etc.) and NO Chinese on it.  The second menu had the Cantonese dishes, included the Chinese names on it.  I guess you know which menu to order from!",

The chef used to cook in hotels in Hong Kong, and the wife is often seen bossing around.   They serve authentic Guangdong cuisine (south China) that is different from most Chinese restaurants (Sichuan, West China) in the Squirrel Hill area.   Guangdong cuisine is not spicy. I would only compare Ka Mei with Cafe 33 in this neighborhood (Taiwanese, South/East China area).  In Pittsburgh, Ka Mei is most comparable to LuLu noodles.   Food-wise, they have dine-in, take outs, entrees with rice, noodles, and even CONGEE.  Their Beef Chow Fun ($12.95, today) does not disappoint. It is as Hong Kong as it can get, but rather expensive compared to Lulu ($8, yelp photo 2015).   Other recommended dishes include \"Beef Brisket w Radish\", \"Squid w black bean sauce\", \"cold chicken\", \"Spareribs w Bitter melon\" (they certainly did \"bitter melon\" right. However, not all Hongkong ppl like it, my dad and my brother hate better melon, and my mum and I love it. so... it is authentic, but you might not like it.)  Area-wise, it's decently clean, kind-of small.  It's certainly NOT dating-materials. Good for students. NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS. NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS. NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS.  This family-owned diner CANNOT handle big groups. They almost turned our group of 10 away once. 2-4 ppl per table is ideal for them, after all, there is only one chef and most of the time 2 waitresses.",

The boss come out twice and arrogantly told us that that don't come here if you don't want to wait. Also, don't come if you are from Pitts. When we were about to leave, the boss asked which school we go to and we answered Pitts. Then she asked everybody else which school they go to. With the answers, CMU, she tried to humiliate us by making the statement that people from Pitts are more arrogant than those from CMU.",

The owner of the restaurant got mad at us and literately said in a rude manner that 'don't come here to eat if you do not wait.' I cannot believe my ears and wonder if I could not even check my food after 35mins waiting without any notice!!! Even worse, the owner humiliated us in front of other guest after we pay the check!!! Never ever do I have such terrible experience!!! Will never go there again!!",

I did not engage in conversation, I just felt as if it was pretty rude not to even address me.   The food felt like it took forever to come. I was constantly looking at my phone to see what time it was.   The food was very good once it did arrive. Although, we were weirdly never served ice water.   There were mostly Chinese people eating, however there was 1 table of Americans.   I will give Ka Mei a second chance one day, but for now, 3 stars.",

The price is a little bit more expensive than other Asian places around the area, but the food options is incredibly diverse. They have a part of the menu that is dedicated to foreigners, and another dedicated to people familiar with Hong Kong eatery. What's nice is they have the cold chicken, roasted duck, steamed black bean pork, steamed pork, and seasonal whole fish! If you come around lunch time, they also have  (soy milk) and  (you tiao)!",
