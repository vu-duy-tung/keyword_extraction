    "text": "I was so looking forward to finally checking out Superior Motors!   Saturday night had reservations at 8:10.  A lot of empty tables but our table not ready so sit at bar.  No problem, wanted a cocktail anyway.  Sat for a good 7 minutes (several people behind bar and seats still left open)  but no one comes to take drink order.  Finally I flag the bartender over; he just stands there, no \"Hi, what can I get you\". Ordered a Grey Goose martini very dirty & extra olives.  No Grey Goose, bartender said he would never have that on his self, more than a tad arrogantly.  OK, not a fan of Kettle1 but not much choice.  I excuse myself to bathroom to apply lipstick.  Two other women in bathroom tell me I probably shouldn't go in the one stall (there are 2) but I just want to put on lipstick (there is no mirror in the main bathroom. minimalistic urban industrial? This definitely is bad!). I look in bathroom; there is throw up all over the commode & toilet paper everywhere. No, I'll wait. Song about Jesus Christ is playing. Back to bar & drink not waiting. (This is 10 minutes later as I had to wait behind 2 women in BR!)  Drink finally comes & martini glass not even half full (I guess this is standard at a more expensive restaurant) but 3 tiny olives on a tooth pic that had come out of a grocery store bought jar of olives? Maybe this will be one of the best martinis I've ever had; Not, especially for $14.  Maybe dinner will be better?  20 more minutes (which is still OK; a good meal is worth waiting for, right?) hostess comes to seat us... at one of the lounge tables at front of restaurant. (This table had been open when we got there) Tables are about knee high. Is this standard at expensive eclectic industrial restaurants?  Maybe, but we really didn't want to be bending over to eat. This would've been a great area to hang with friends having cocktails but not dinner.  We politely ask for another table (still empty ones) but host (I tell him about bathroom) looks a little hesitant so we say we will eat at bar.  Still OK. looking forward to a great meal. We order, my friend: beef tartare and venison, me: crab, hamachi and mushroom.  Order another drink, this time K1 & pineapple (no cranberry that's not in a gun?) which was another $14.  I guess that's standard for a shot of vodka?  Food comes in good time.  First, tartare, crab and hamachi.  Friend says tartare tastes like fish & doesn't eat much.  My crab is good but very little crab. Hamachi is really good.  Next, venison.  Friend says great taste but chewy?  But the worst is my mushroom.  See pic.  Its burnt (not seared or charred),  the 3 tiny mushrooms on top are really burnt & shriveled. couscous is OK but very mushy, even for couscous. I proceed to try to cut the mushroom but its difficult. I take a bite. Rubber. So not good. When barmaid comes over to ask if everything is OK; she doesn't wait for an answer & I am still contemplating eating it. I decide I'm just going to suck it up & not say anything.  I almost never send anything back.  And maybe, I'm just not the food connoisseur & this is how it's supposed to be; I try another small bite.  No, no better.  When time to clear plates, I guess the barmaid had told Host that I hadn't eaten. He comes over & is very nice & says they will bring me another dish but my friend is done & I'm pretty done.  I say, just buy me a drink. I do not have a problem spending a lot on a great dinner. However, I expect not to pay for the mushroom but when the bill comes, my friend tells me they did not take it off.  I say, \"really?\"  Barmaid  overhears, I think & comes over & takes the bill & takes the mushroom off. I am grateful for this. I leave 20% tip ( I usually leave more).  Bartender never thanks us or asks if we want desert (rude guy). I regret it but I figure it might have to be shared with the other girl bartender. I do know people that have gone to SM & had great meals but I probably will not go back there.  It was just the combination of everything.  But this is disappointing because it has a cool vibe & could have been somewhere where I would go often, based on vicinity.  By the way, went to BR before leaving & stall not cleaned.  Also, I've heard that SM offers 50% discount to the community which is nice but the average dinner would be about 75$ - $100 & don't think the residents of Braddock could really afford that. Also, I had read that Kevin S was going to start a culinary program for under-privileged which would be a great gift to the community I hope that does happens!",

    "text": "C'mon Team Sousa! I cannot believe that the menu selection had so few options for vegetarians! It is getting tiresome to go to these hot new numbers to find that it's all duck, pork, shank, etc. etc. I expect more from restaurants than a smattering of token veg dishes. This is especially so when my friends and I go out of our way (big time) to go to Braddock. I would have had my drink and split, but well, I was kinda of stuck...in Braddock! Staff are wonderful and the drinks were grand. The latter helped to numb my disappointment. So, if you are reading this, please do more for those of us who do not eat meat, or at the very least perhaps post the menu so we/I can make a decision to go way out of my way to visit your business or not.",

    "text": "I will say as anyone else in the Pittsburgh area, I was extremely excited to try out Chef Kevin Sousa's new restaurant superior motors. I've heard nothing but good things from this place. We decided to go here for a double date and soon found out that was not a very good idea. We ordered $200 in food to find out that the portions were small, under seasoned and things that were supposed to be served warm such as chicken, were cold in the middle. Myself and the others who accompanied me are all fellow cooks so we we're extremely disappointed. Our service was very poor as well, our server only came to our table to bring drinks and the check. That's it. Sorry to say, but we will not be back.",

The hostess didn't invite us in as there were only two chairs available and one of us would have to stand. I pointed out that we were all 3 standing now, so that would be an improvement. The drinks were interesting and bar service was excellent. At 8:30 had still not met our wait person although we were finally at our table. 8:42 and still no food or drink on our table... just menus which we have memorized by now.  Yay!! Ordered food at last: 8:50. Bar drinks comp'ed due to our long wait.   Apps came out fairly quickly and pretty much as  billed. Delicious and meticulously prepared. Lots of unusual flavors to enjoy and international flair.   The main course was incredibly well prepared and a delight all three. They brought us a dessert gratis as well which was OK but not stellar.  The service once we were seated was good and they were very aware of our wait.   I would come again with an earlier  reservation time for sure. Food is worth it, but they need to learn how to move the first seating along.",

We had the cold tomato soup, spicy, tasty gazpacho. It was excellent. Then shared the steak, cooked perfect to medium rare and super tasty, and gnocchi which might have been the best dish of the three! Finished off with chocolate dessert and sumac sorbet. Both quite unique and flavorful. The decor is nice, the wait staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The portions are small, but I prefer that to stuffing myself! I did not come home hungry! I will definitely come back, great place to treat yourself to a very nice meal.",

The attitude is culinary snobbery to the MAX. I always thought the customer is always right.. not here your treated very poorly and made to feel uncomfortable if you don't eat the tiny portions as they are served! My wife likes filet mignon the tiny portion came rare . Owner? Cook yes not chef cook berated her saying that they get their beef from \" hairy cows with little fat and that they lnow how to prepare it\"! Wouldn't cook my Mother-in-Law's fish any more... it basically was raw!! Couldn't get a Bloody Mary from the bar.. kind made you feel like a low life. Interesting thing as we have been to the Duquesne Club and the Le Mont since then both made fabulous Bloody Marys!!!! Way to expensive, bad attitude... you want elegant atmosphere, great view, fair price, excellent cuisine... my wife and my money will happily go to the LeMont app won't let me give NO STARS THAT'S why the got 1.  Had to go out to eat later let this establishment hungry and greatly disappointed. Wouldn't recommend it it anyone!!! Won't see me going back....",

Chef Kevin mixes ingredients that initially seem unmatched (e.g. Foie gras and cherries), that end up complementing each other spectacularly.  Our party of three thoroughly enjoyed every course.  We found ourselves noting the contrasting flavors and textures and eagerly sharing tastes of everything that we ordered.  Everything up to and including the coffee was top flight.  The staff was cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive.  We will absolutely be returning here.  Kudos to Chef Kevin and his wonderful staff!",

Also in attendance with me was my 4 year old son, so I will give you his review as well. First off, the wait staff and Chris in management were completely gracious and accommodating in having plain pasta prepared for my son immediately which he devoured. The adults enjoyed the salad, Octopus and rice cake appetizers. I'm reading a lot about portions in the reviews and while they were certainly not huge, they weren't unreasonably small. My son said the salad tasted like soap but continued eating anyway. I didn't quite come away with that that mouthfeel and thought it was fine, maybe slightly unremarkable. The octopus and rice cakes really took the prize. Not sure what was going on with either of them but they were gone in about five minutes. We had the hangar steak and chicken entrees. These were nothing short of spectacular and the steak was borderline art. Expertly prepared in every aspect. We all shared the chocolate and pastry dessert and were very pleased with both. We will be returning regularly and I can't say enough about the service and overall atmosphere. Highly recommended!",

The design of Superior is a nice fit for formerly industrial Braddock.  Exposed brick, concrete floors, simple wood tables- industrial hip but not painfully so.   Place was packed.   Cocktails refreshing and  tasty. We had the heirloom tomato soup - green and exceptional with a kick. Rice cake appetizer unusual and fabulous. All of the main courses were outstanding and played beautifully. One note- the bathrooms had a super cool dyson wash and dry faucet in one that our group had a tough time figuring out.  Just start waving your hands near the sink and something will happen! Looking forward to many return visits to Superior.",

    "text": "Outstanding all around. Was there Sat nite 9/8. Cocktails were innovative, unique and delicious in different ways. Wife had vodka with tomato water, I had gin & watermelon. Hers somehow tasted of egg custard, while mine was astringent in a very positive way, which sounds weird.   The octopus with huitlacoche may be the single best Mexican dish being served in all Pittsburgh. It's a flavor profile I've missed since spending a year in Mexico City in the 90s. I'd eat that every day. Wife had the tomato soup, which was a bit spicier than she was thinking, but delicious.   I didn't want to miss out on the foie gras, so Chris suggested we have it as a mid course. And we did. What came was the most absurdly fabulous foie gras we've ever had - it was like a dessert course. The sweetness of beets & cherries and cacao quality of the ground chickories surrounding what was basically a block of goose liver ice cream. Crazy. It's a dish I'll remember for a long time.  Wife had the chicken on Chris's suggestion - and neither of us ever eats chicken out, especially not when \"fine\" dining. It was more or less familiar as comfort food, but with a level of sophistication and layered flavors that made it worthy of the menu. I had the tuna, which was both cold (not cool) and warm at the same time. Chef Sousa has always been a master at textures, but using temperature as an element in this dish worked well. Only thing I didn't really like was the firmness of the chickpeas. Some other bean/legume might've been a better choice.  As I'm a coffee professional, Chris agreed to take us back and look at the brewing station, which comprises twin $700 drip brewers. Chris couldn't recall the make, but they look like Ratio Eights (I could be wrong on this). Regardless, the coffee brew standards are as rigorous, if not moreso, than they were at Salt, which was the first area restaurant to take post-meal coffee seriously.  All in all, great evening in a great space with great food and service. We'll be back.",

    "text": "Flawless food for those who are open to new textures, flavors, and ingredient combinations.  Environment- SM is set up in the same way as many modern gastropub type environments with clean sharp edges, exposed brick, and modern design elements. As stated in other reviews, I did get confused by the dyson hand dryer/washer but not enough to impact my experience. Music was not too loud in my experience. I was glad we were seated at the tables that were higher level. I did notice some tables being low similar to a bottle service type table which I don't think I would prefer  Food- SM menu lists a few ingredients that the dish contains, but does not fully represent the complexity of the dish you will receive. We ordered two starters, one entree, and two desserts. The starts are 'small' in the sense that they wouldn't be appropriate to share with more than 2 people if everyone wanted multiple bites. The waitress even suggested each person order 3 courses. The entree size is appropriately sized and I would not classify it as small. The desserts were very decadent and filling, so I felt their size was appropriate for the end of the meal.  The flavors, textures, and combinations of ingredients are something you will see rarely in the area. The rice cakes area very different experience, sort of like a more chewy gnocchi in a savory and spicy red sauce. The raw scallops are very decadent and rich thanks to the creme fraiche. The halibut is seared wonderfully with a great crispy potato and purees. Finally, the smoked chocolate mousse and Pavlova were respectfully rich and light ways to end the meal. Only high praise for the uniqueness of the food while still remaining conventionally tasty. Sometimes food from places like SM can be weird for the sake of it, but even those apprehensive about the ingredients contained in any of their dishes would likely still be persuaded once they took a bite.  Price- Considering I don't usually order drinks, my average bill price will likely be lower than other reviews. Still, with 2 starters, an entree, and 2 desserts, the price came out to about 77 dollars. While I can't afford to eat out this way every weekend, for special occasions it is well worth it.",

    "text": "Was out and about on a date and after having some appetizers and drinks at a few other places made a last minute reservation here.  Was able to snag a table late on a Saturday.  When we arrived, the table was not ready but we were able to get a drink and listen to some live music outside on the patio.  After a short wait were seated in a L-shaped seat near the front.  Since it was a date it was perfect but if I was just going out to dinner with a friend or colleagues, that seat would not work.  We informed the waiter that we had been snacking all night and were trying to figure out the portion sizes.  They recommended 4-5 dishes, which ended up being too much.  Not sure it it was an up sell or they were just big eaters.   In terms of the food, gnocchi in the halibut entree was world class.  Have an Italian mother in law and this was likely the best I have had.  Pork belly was awesome.  Really everything was.  Vodka drink with the roasted green pepper was good enough for me to have two.  Ambiance at night looking at Edgar Thompson Steel Mill makes it all the better.",

The octopus is particularly tender and flavorful. The menu is deliberately minimalist - it's to encourage you to talk to your server! It's a unique space in a unique town, and I'm so happy it's open. Also, the house cocktail menu is super awesome and tasty, especially the vermouth.",

    "text": "I love everything about Superior Motors. What they do, how they do it, and why they do it.  Their investment in Braddock and the people of the area would be enough reason to go, but then there's the food, and the staff, and the ambience. In every aspect, Kevin and his colleagues find ways to be inventive, simple, thoughtful and splendid. Our server, Bonnie, was smart, funny, attentive and caring and everyone we encountered there was similarly invested in making the night something special for the diners. They also seemed to like each other and to enjoy working there--always a good sign. And the food and cocktails are just extraordinary. Lots to choose from for vegetarians and carnivores (not always the easiest situation to find in the Burgh) and lots of locally sourced and hand picked ingredients. We particularly liked the Braddock greens with porcini, parmesan, pickled white pine, the chorizo-esque shrimp appetizer with tapenade, shishito, saffron and rice cakes with kimchi, cilantro, peanut, tempeh. The chicken was the one slight let down, but the eggplant entree was delicious, and the not to be missed take on the Pittsburgh Pretzel Salad dessert (with mulberries picked that evening) was a great finish. Worth the drive and whatever else you have to do to get there. Anyone in or near Western PA owes it to themselves to visit--especially if there's a show on at Barebones Theater, right behind the restaurant, or if there's an art show in the UnSmoke Gallery next door. I'll definitely be back...",

I got 2 small squares of lamb that were 90% fat, less than an ounce of meat total with about 1/4 cup of bizarre veggies. My friend got salmon... maybe 3 ounces that she  described as \"interesting, but not in a good way.\" We were talking after this experience and were asked to leave as they needed our table.

    "text": "I had such high expectations for this place and while the food was very good it didn't wow me as much as I thought it would. The cocktails were fun and tasty and apparently there is a two drink new world vs old world drink every night but our server did not tell us about this until we saw the drinks being ordered and carried out from the bar to other customers. (Our server did seem to be off his game that evening- when asking for a wine recommendation with the lamb he wasn't able to give one- so perhaps the less than amazing service was part of the reason this place didn't knock my socks off). I did really enjoy the Non Alcoholic strawberry balsamic drink. The play on potato salad with the whey vinaigrette was very tasty and I loved the fun take on a classic dish. We also tried the Pigs face and ocean trout, both of which were good but not exactly what I was expecting. My risotto entree was one of the best dishes of the night and my husband did enjoy the lamb which was well cooked. My favorite dish of the night was dessert- another fun take on a classic- jello pretzel salad. It had perfect creaminess to crunch- I would go back and order it 5 more times (although I'm assuming this would only be part of the summer menu). We will definitely visit again since this was such a highly ranked restaurant (not only in Pittsburgh but in the country- rated one of the best new restaurants) but I will say there are restaurants in Pittsburgh I've been much more impressed with overall.",

    "text": "Where to start..  Lets preface.  I love giving great reviews and I certainly prefer to have a list of awesome places to suggest to friends when they ask, \"Any new tasty restaurants\"?   That is unfortunately not possible with this new Pittsburgh spot.  The front of house staff are very well trained and courteous.  Service is very well timed and the descriptions of the dishes are thorough.  Wanting to get a well rounded taste of chef Kevin Sousa's latest menu, we ordered a wide sampling of starters and mains.  The cast of characters to begin included rice cakes, hamachi, and a crab puree type appetizer.    The crab puree was indeed good and comparable in texture and taste to a seafood bisque.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to salvage the meal.    The rice cakes were uninteresting and bland, with a sort of sauce I would compare to canned Spaghetti-O's mixed with a tablespoon of chili paste.    The yellowtail (hamachi) was certainly the worst of the three.  Not due to any issue with flavor coherence but simply due to the fact that the fish itself was well past it's prime.    A few other details came to light as we waited for our mains to arrive.  It was very cold on this particular night and while the place does look quite cool (being housed in an old car dealership) this is a case of form over function as the temperature in the all brick/concrete dining room had to be somewhere around 55 degrees.  Mains arrived.    The scallops were good but it would be outlandish if they weren't considering it's a simple caramelizing sear in the pan and onto the plate.  The short ribs missed the mark entirely and didn't have any of the velvety, buttery consistency and texture that these delicious morsels are prized for.  Then there was the whole fish which no words could describe.  Lets try.    It tasted like an Monongahela river carp pulled out a week before and as much as I appreciate local sustainable food, that's not ok.",

Our waiter did his job with a flurry of matter of fact answers to questions.  I asked if a drink listed was Superior Motor's version of a Margarita.  It was not so I ordered and was disappointed in the listed Epsolon Blanco Tequila cocktail. Herb flavors and citrusy which was an all around unappealing flavor.  We ordered 4-5 small plates as first course. We got those after our entrees came. No big deal. The food was all good. One guest's entree was cold.  Dessert arrived -- all clever and interesting presentations for sure.  Distance is inconvenient for us.  All considered it was an interesting evening as we entertained our Boston foodie friends in for a visit to the 'burgh.",

    "text": "Preface: I had high hopes coming in here. I really, really wanted to like this place. I'm a big supporter of the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and want places like this to succeed.  The short story: claims to be on the same level as the big boys like Cure, Butcher and the Rye, Eleven, but falls flat. More on the level of The Porch but double the price.    I really cannot for the life of me understand what all the hype about this place is for. It really makes me question the very notion of popular opinion. I seem to be in the sane minority of people here.  Atmosphere: Has a great exterior and interior. However, this place is very, very noisy. They need to invest in some sound dampening. You cannot hear yourself think over the cacophony in this place. I could forgive the noise if the food lived up to all the hype ...  Drinks: We only ordered wine, which was good, but it was a half pour. Very disappointing. Two sips and it was gone. For those prices, it was downright insulting. The drinks could be forgiven if the food lived up to all the hype ...  Food: Here are some adjectives that were going through my head after plate after disappointing plate came my way--flavorless, bland, one-note, pedestrian, underwhelming. The only good thing about the whole experience is that the food looked great. The presentation was top notch-- it is a complete shame that under the hood you are getting a Buick instead of a Mercedes. There were no layers to the flavor, no complexity, everything just hit the same under-salted umami one-note, droning on and on like a child hitting the C key of a piano. I consider myself a decent cook, but nothing spectacular, and I kept thinking throughout every course that I could have done a better job. That's not what you want going through your mind at a fine-dining experience. I would like to think that maybe that head chef called out that night or something to explain how bad the food was, but for those prices I'm not going to give them a second chance.  By the time our $160 check came around, I felt like I'd been mugged.",

Next was the beef tartare app , the haddock for the main course followed by desserts for the table - bread pudding and chocolate covered ice cream. Other apps at our table included the rice cakes and the celery root soup. Other entrees:  another Haddock, Veal and Short rib. We all sampled the entrees and loved them.   Exceptional service topped it all off.  If you're into a unique approach to food then this is a must do.",

    "text": "What a disappointment! I've been looking forward to the opening of superior motors ever since I first heard about the concept for years ago. We live across the river in a borough with challenges similar to those of Braddock and the concept of the restaurant is really beautiful. Every struggling neighborhood could use a restaurant that seeks to employ and provide skills toLocal residents. So three stars for that vision and for the fact that it seems they're actually carrying it out.  However, my wife and I went out for a big date here last night and ended up leaving halfway through our meal because we didn't want to continue to spend big money on mediocre food. We arrived early and sat at the bar for cocktails and some quiet reading time. The decor might've been cool in 2002, but to see exposed brick and a general warehouse feel in 2018 seems passe. There was nothing comfortable or beautiful about the space. The barstools are set a long way away from the bar so you have to really lean forward. A surprising proportion of the seating - - probably half of it - - is booths and couches around low coffee tables. I always prefer a chair that I can position as close to or as far from the table as I like. And Heaven forbid I would have to sit at one of those little couches and bend over my low table while I try to eat a nice meal!  We then moved to a table for dinner. At the table behind us a server was giving a voluble lecture on the menu. It went on for at least four minutes. We ordered a couple small plates to start, at which point our waiter recommended that we order our entire meal so that we would not \"have to wait between courses.\" When we go out for a nice evening, we don't think of the time spent at the table as waiting. If we want to order a couple of small plates and then order an entree later please just let us do that. We got the definite sense that the waiter was trying to move us out of our table.   The waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and helped us pick an excellent Italian rose. That bottle was the highlight of the evening, really something special.  One of our small plates was \"OCEAN TROUT /  everything panzanella, buttermilk, ramps.\" We are big fans of ramps. We are also big fans of gravlax style cured fish, which is a good thing because that's how the trout was prepared. The Panzanella turned out to be a quarter handful of tiny crouton cubes. But no ramps! I asked the waiter about this. He went back to the kitchen to check. Ha ha, he returned, it turns out there are tiny specs of ramps among the bread cubes. OK, fine. But why advertise this as a feature of this particular dish? They might as well have mentioned salt and pepper for all the ramps did for this dish.  Now it was beginning to dawn on us why the server behind us had been giving a lecture on the menu. This is a menu that requires not just detailed commentary but actual error correction. The descriptions are opaque to the point of being misleading.  Another item, \"DIVER SCALLOP /  (*) buckwheat noodles, cuttlefish, sesame,\" consisted of a very cold raw scallop diced among soupy noodles awash in squid ink and sesame oil. There was nothing transformative about this - and despite being longtime fans of various raw preparations of shellfish and other kinds of fish, we found this dish unpleasant to the point of leaving it on the table. We also felt a bit deceived; we were both looking forward to squid and while we have had wonderful dishes that involve squid ink, a bit of the actual cuttlefish meat would have been nice. And in this case the squid ink was used without subtlety and without any apparent complementarity with the scallop.  The food highlight was the boudin noir that came alongside a deep fried puck of pulled pork (\"pig's face\"). This was an exquisite take on blood pudding and reminded me of the wonderful meals I had back at Kevin Sousa's first restaurant, Salt of the Earth. Superior motors might stand out as a top 10 restaurant in the nation because of its story and its genuinely good mission. But I would not even put it in the top 10 of restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Where did we go after we left mid meal? To our neighborhood standby, honest johns in Homestead. The menu there generally has nothing you couldn't make yourself with some effort at home, but it is all very very well executed and as we looked around we realized that honest johns employed just as many minority, neighborhood residents as superior motors--and not just busing tables but also serving and bartending. They also have an excellent woman chef which is a rarity not only in Pittsburgh but nationwide. Here's a restaurant that is very quietly doing great things for its neighborhood--things that superior motors has received national accolades for. Come to Homestead and check it out!",

I love the concept of this venue as it's goal is to celebrate Braddock and be a heart of this area. It for sure achieved this goal. This place was packed.   Making a reservation was not easy and you had to leave a credit card which I found odd for a three top. This policy served its purpose as we did not cancel as we were tempted. We didn't want to get a fee for canceling.   Server Bonnie was Amazing. She knew the menu inside and out. Love her.   The food is great for a foodie but as a bigger guy I need more bulk. I left hungry after ordering an appetizer and a steak. Both dishes were good but the portions were smaller than most venues.   We checked ahead and they said they could accommodate  a child. This was not the case. They only had risotto available which is not the best for a kid. We ate it for him and did not enjoy this dish.   Braddock is about 20-25 drive from downtown Pittsburgh. Keep that in mind. After making the drive and spending 150$ on Dinner for two and leaving hungry, I was disappointed. For a foodie, it a gem due to their creative use of flavors. To someone who is more meat and potatoes or does not prefer ordering multiple dishes, I would dine elsewhere. I wish them all the success in the world.",

I have celiacs, and my husband is vegetarian, so we have to be careful about what we eat. Bon carefully and thoughtfully explained how certain dishes could be made to accommodate our dietary needs. She also made sure that the chef knew about our special requests.   Bon also suggested a phenomenal wine parring of rose and a red, both from the same grape. I generally enjoy a very dry wine, and her suggestions did not disappoint!!   I would highly recommend Superior Motors yo anyone looking for spectacular food and excellent service! SM lives up to the hype!",

    "text": "Fantastic. Well beyond (already high) expectations!  First heard about the restaurant on Anthony Bourdain, and have been waiting, first, for the restaurant to open and, second, for a chance to visit Pittsburgh in order to get a chance to dine here. Yes, it is now an international destination food experience.  The last Bourdain recommendation I tried was a noodle house in Sapporo Japan, complete with its \"Anthony Bourdain Here Eat\" sign on the window. Am looking forward to continue chasing him around the globe.  At Superior Motors we were almost embarrassed by the attention and loved the atmosphere, the wait staff and - last but far from least - the food.  Earlier in the day we had enjoyed an open house by acclaimed Pittsburgh artist Mia Tarducci and immediately recognized her work inside the front door. That painting alone encapsulates the 'grow it at home' showcasing philosophy at Superior Motors.  Chris' wine recommendation was on point as was his strong encouragement to try the chicken. Seriously, who recommends the - cheapest thing on the menu - chicken dish? Only someone that knows you are going to be blown away by it.  The best moment of all was our server's recommendation for dessert. \"I'd eat it off the floor,\" she advised. Ok, maybe not the kind of recommendation you'd expect to accompany food like this. After trying the ganache, though, I agree. In fact, I'd even fight her to eat it off the floor.  A peak inside the kitchen after dinner was also outstanding. Ooh, would it be fun to work in there.   Thank you Kevin and Chris!",

    "text": "We spent $1,200 for a horrible sub par meal.  The moment we walked in was indicative of future disappointment.  We were quickly told that you were running a little behind on reservations and that there was currently no table for us to sit at. Our reservation was for 7:00 and we arrived at 6:45. We were directed to a back room that was a little cold for our liking, but was a spot for all 6 of us to be together without standing for the duration of our  long wait. We were finally sat at our table at 7:50.  I booked this reservation on October 29 for the November 2 event date. Unfortunately, your menu for this event was not available at the time I booked.   All 6 of us have been eagerly awaiting this \"ice cream dinner\" and I have to say, from the moment we walked in the door (this being the first time at Superior Motors for all 6 of us) we were met with utter disappointment.   The first 3 entrees were all cold dishes or versions of tartare/sashimi. The fourth, an underwhelming and concerning raw version of squab. The fifth, a sweet course, was my favorite. I was under the impression that the first 4 courses would be some form of \"savory\" and was highly disappointed. The sixth \"sweet\" course was my least favorite. An extremely earthy version of some sort of peanut butter gelatin and mushroom ice cream with a very garlic tasting creme anglaise.   We decided to pay the extra money to pair each course with wine or a cocktail. The bar manager did a nice job with these pairings. And to be honest, the drinks were the highlight of the dinner. My favorite part of the dinner were the coffee liqueur and the bourbon creme.  All in all, this was not worth the hefty price tag that you charged.  From the service, to the food, to the drinks, it has put a very bad taste in my mouth for the highly rated Superior Motors.   Had I have seen the menu for this event prior to booking, I would have never done so.  A dinner as unique as an \"ice cream dinner\" promoting savory and sweet dishes, should appeal to a more general clientele. The focus should have been on the ice cream. Not use the ice cream as a garnish or condiment.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that any of us will ever dine at your establishment again.",

For appetizers we had the potatoes and the shrimp, for our main dishes we had the steak and duck and for dessert we had the pretzel salad and ganache. Everything was delicious and I would order it again.   The attention to detail from placing silverware on a c channel to the wait staff explaining every dish down to the tiniest detail. The bartenders (Adam and Jeremy) were a delight as well. My dining partner and I were seated at the bar and they were very attentive to our needs. My friend was pregnant and the bartender went the extra step to make her a mocktail that wasn't in the menu.   The only reason I am giving this review a 4 instead of a 5 is during our dining experience at the bar, all the servers and food runners would serve the guests their food from across the bar not reach behind them, which we enjoyed. But there was one man who kept reaching behind guests at the bar to deliver their food and it made it uncomfortable for my friend as she had to lean into me as he delivered the guests food next to her multiple times. I believe the man was some sort of manager as he was not dressed as the other staff was.  We loved the food and the atmosphere, we will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "Last night we finally found a reason to get to Superior Motors. It was outstanding in all respects, although the drive from the north hills was extremely painful. The building, located in a severely depressed area, is beautifully remodeled, with all details, down to the napkin holders, thoughtfully designed to fit the neighborhood's steel mill heritage. Our party of four adults and two young girls ordered most of the items on the menu from appetizers to desserts. Everything was excellent. Service was satisfactory, although the pace could have been quicker at the end, with the young girls obviously running out of patience. The wine list is well conceived and fairly priced (in the context of an upscale restaurant, that is). While the menu prices seem relatively low, there are no full dinners available, with the main courses being something between a small plate and ala-cart entre. You need to order two or three items to make a meal. It turns out to be quite expensive, so it's not an everyday destination. While I always prefer the weekday experience at the best restaurants, next time I'm going on a Saturday night to avoid the rush hour traffic!",

We ordered 1.Smoked Potato 2. Chicken Livers 3.Scallop 4.Shrimp 5.Rice Cakes for a First Course and Halibut for a Second Course.  The smoked Potato was nothing more than 4 sections of baked potato smothered in sauce. Hardly worth anything approaching the $12.00 charged. The chicken livers were the consistency of mush with too much sauce.  While somewhat tasty the presentation was a turnoff and not worth $12.00.  The scallop was one large scallop cut into 3 pieces.  The flavors were excellent. The shrimp dish was ok but failed to meld flavors to excite the palate.  The rice cakes were horrible. Dry flavorless and surrounded by gummy pieces of tempeh. Absolutely disgusting.  The Halibut was delicious.  The server (Bartender) knew we were not pleased and told us he told the General  Manager who he said would be over to see us immediately. He never came in the 20 minutes we waited for him.  Mistakes can and will be made in the restaurant business but failing to address a problem on the part of management is inexcusable.",

First off there were no delays in serving; we were not rushed to finish eating; the place was almost entirely full and bustling; the decor was tasteful; it was noisy but not deafening. Drinks were good; the non alcoholic beverage was so good that one of our party ordered one with vodka! We ordered a variety of dishes and shared many.  3 of us had the walleye which was pan-seared not deep fried and quite good.  Some dishes were the kind you might not order if dining alone (additions like smoked potatoes or risotto) but were surprisingly robust; we ended up with 2 of each and they were devoured.  A shrimp dish looked like nothing you would expect but nonetheless tasted and had the mouth feel you would recognize.   I'm not a fan of squash soups but this one was as good as it gets!   The rice dish was mislabeled - I would not have called it a cake - it was more like dressed-up gummy bear logs - interesting treatment if not the tastiest dish. Finally the desserts: we ordered all five and shared those as well. In a word: delectable all.  The perfect finale.  Go, eat and ignore the whiners.",

    "text": "Superior Motors is obviously an awesome addition to the Mon valley. And, considering the lack of options in the area, those of us who live or work in the region have been awaiting this newcomer for a while. So, in that context I have nothing critical to say of the venture and wish them the best of successes.   However, my review of the food must proceed as unbiased and frank as possible.   First off, the ambiance and decor made for a very inviting scene from the outside in the evenings. And upon entering, the energy and liveliness of the open kitchen contributed to an enticing atmosphere.   The front of the house was friendly and professional, if not a bit \"chilly\" in their reception. This contrasted with the warmth of the decor and open fire behind the bar that serves as the grill station for the kitchen.   We began with drinks at the bar which were expertly prepared, and which the bar staff were happy to describe as well as forthcoming in their recommendations. I always enjoy a bartender who's willing to guide a decision.   Once our table was ready we were brought into the side dining room which, because of the hard brick walls, was quite loud and lacked the warmth of the open dining area. Nonetheless, it had energy and was not completely cut off from the vibe of the rest of the joint.   Our server was professional, but was not patient enough for us to discuss the menu options with her and just suggested that she come back after we had decided. In a restaurant of this caliber I expect a bit more from a server. The chilly reception by the front of the house and our server's engagement seemed to at least be internally consistent, although probably not what they're going for.   We each had an appetizer and an entree along with a dessert we shared. We chose the octopus, and the foie for our appetizers. For our entrees, we chose the lamb and the beef.   While the grilled octopus itself was excellent, the dish as a whole lacked a coherent idea. Individual elements were well executed, but the dish failed to communicate a clear direction to me. It had some unique elements (huitlacoche, for example) but gave the impression that it was simultaneously reaching out for something new, while at the same time holding back. This curious contrast was also evident in the bright bold acidic flavors coming up against the more traditionally rich ingredients in the dishes. This is probably intentional, but perhaps I just didn't get it to fully enjoy it.   The common thread of slightly dissonant culinary \"notes\" was reflected in each of the remaining dishes, except the dessert, surprising because desserts often are the least imaginative components of a restaurant's vision.   The other appetizer, the foie terrine was the least effective of the 5 dishes we tried. While the foie was succulent and buttery, it was entirely overwhelmed by the cherries and chocolate crumble underneath. This would actually have been an excellent dessert. It was sweet enough for it, and the foie could just as well have been a butter cream.   Our entrees fared better than the apps. The beef dish was quite excellent, it was executed perfectly and the mushroom and kale, and goat cheese sides were perfect. This dish was the best of them all and my guess is, it's representative of what the rest of the menu is going for.   The lamb entree was good as well, with the protein excellently prepared. Again, we had curious dissonant acid notes laid up against traditionally rich items. In theory this should work, all dishes, especially rich ones, need acid, but for some reason the individual components just never meshed for me.   Finally, we finished with the dessert. It was a pavlova, meringue over custard, and finally the sour notes that had been attempting to make it to the forefront of the previous dishes without distracting from the main profile were able to shine. The meringue was beautifully plated and had a subtle chewy texture to it that made it quite enjoyable.   Overall, this was a very strong four star effort, and we're looking forward to coming back. Hopefully by then the service will have risen to the level of what's expected at a place like this. And, hopefully the dishes and the menu will have gelled into a coherent vision. After such a long and arduous road in making this place actually come to fruition, I have no doubt that these final kinks will be overcome as well. And for that, we and the Mon valley can be grateful to see what's in store for us!",

Superior..  The decor  was interesting and definitely different. Including the strang hand dryer in the restroom that seems to just blow water on you.

I am really hopping no one gets sick.  This  is clealry not a place for us and after $75 bucks we both left hungry and ended up stopping at the north braddock street fair for a $4  hot sausage. .. it's accros the street from a steel mill for crying out loud ... its like they got half way to right and then went a totally different direction.

    "text": "Pittsburgh is lacking in restaurants with solid vegetarian options and unfortunately, Superior Motors follows suit. I always get my hopes up when a new place opens. There is one vegan option and one option which can be made vegetarian by leaving out some of the main meat components. The two vegetarian plates we got were fine, but nothing special for $18 and $19. The one vegan option lacked a substantial protein source and the modified menu item just felt like something was missing (because it was, they left out the meat because I asked them to). The server recommended that people usually get \"a 2 or 3 course menu\". As there were no vegetarian shareable apps, we passed on the appetizers and got entrees and desserts. We were with two non-vegetarians and all together four entrees, four desserts, two mocktails and an ice tea was $150 plus tip.  I knew it would be busy, so I booked a table in advance and no issues with my online reservation. They called three days in advance to confirm. I thought the service was great and our servers and hostess were excellent. As others have said, the inside looks great. The dining room was completely full when we were there and I didn't notice being particularly slow. The plating of the food was just beautiful. Of note, it was difficult to talk because of the noise level. Maybe this is because of  sound bouncing off of the brick? The noise level was kind of like Shadyside Mad Mex on Friday night but without the music. Hard to hear each other speak. One person in our group had a hearing aid and he finally  just stopped trying to participate in conversation because he just couldn't hear what we were saying that was a bummer.  Overall, for vegetarians... I don't think Superior Motors really hits the spot for the cost. I don't mind spending money on good food in a good atmosphere but we probably won't come back here for anything other than a little date night desert. I only live 7 minutes away-but not in Braddock so I don't qualify for the 50% off community loyalty program.    The other thing I couldn't stop thinking about was how expensive everything is for the community that it's in. I know that twice a month, Braddock residents get 50% off... but if they recommend a 2-3 course meal....$10 salad... $28 entree.... $10 dessert. That's still a $24 meal without a drink. As someone who grew up in an area with a similar economic situation to Braddock, I know my family wouldn't have had the cash to spend $24 plus tip for a meal for one person. I know Kevin Sousa is doing some cool things partnering with Grow Pittsburgh and Braddock Farms as well as the unique, free of charge culinary job training program to locals. Even so, I couldn't help feeling sheepish driving through Braddock.... away from our $175 payment.",

Course 3 was duck, which was overcooked and \"nuked\" in my husband's words, and beef. We also ordered a side of risotto. Dessert was ganache and smoked banana. I thought that the food tasted good and different than what other restaurants serve, but my husband said, \"I didn't like anything.\" I ended up eating one of his courses, and after we left this restaurant, he was still hungry and went to Taco Bell (seriously). The waiters at Superior Motors stopped by our table frequently, but I would have preferred to receive a friendlier hello at the beginning and a goodbye at the end. My overall rating for the food and service is 3 stars. The total price for the food--excluding drinks and tip--was about $160.",

The concept is good with smaller portions of good food.  Its a good place to come with friends.  Not so good: Service - our waitress kept forgetting to bring our drinks.  3 times.  We ordered the octopus appetizer (I love octopus) but it was overcooked with what seemed like a haphazard preparation.  The presentation was weird as it was a small amount of food presented on a large plate that was mostly empty.  Beef tartar was better.  For our main dishes, I got the Sturgeon, which had a good, earthy sauce but the fish was overcooked.  My husband got the shrimp dish which was bland.  The venison was the best of the table.  Pork dish was unremarkable.  Seems like the chef was trying too hard instead of delivering good food with interesting preparation, it just came off as meh.  I wanted to really like this place but don't think I would give it another try.",

Staff is knowledgable, helpful and friendly.  The visit begins in the parking lot when we experienced smell of the wood-fire coming from the kitchen.  It has comfortable, pleasant seating with a full bar that is well stocked with a generous, well organized \"vintage and domestic\" wine list.  I can only say our meals (4) were each \"extraordinary\".  The short menu, downloadable in advance (and recommended), helps you to choose dinner.  The menu includes a nice variety of mouthwatering treats for your palate from both sea and land.   I highly recommend a trip/adventure in Braddock to enjoy a Superior dinner.",

The chicken was seasoned well. The cabbage was cooked just right. It wasn't too loud or too quiet. The smoked chocolate dessert was most definitely the star of the show here. I can't wait to come back. Maybe next time I'll go for the salmon. I'm not courageous enough for the octopus.",

We got a seat right next to the kitchen and it was so cool to watch them. The chef came up and talked to us about a the new cabbage dish he created and brought us one on the house. The whole kitchen staff was talkative and super nice. Everything we tried was outstanding..the gnocchi was unreal and the beef tartare was served with seaweed to roll it up with and it was unlike any beef tartare we've ever had. My boyfriend had the pork belly which was melt in your mouth. I had the scallops and they were cooked perfectly. The smoked potatoes we got as a side and we couldn't figure out what was in the sauce but it was incredible. For dessert we had the meringue and chocolate, both delicious and a perfect ending. The whole meal was so flavorful and innovative. If you have a chance to go here DEFINITELY do it!!",

    "text": "Came to Superior Motors on a Saturday night in September while visiting my parents here in the city. We had all loved Salt of the Earth and had been following Kevin Sousa's every move, waiting anxiously for this restaurant to open. My mom had the opportunity to eat dinner here a month earlier and had told us the food lived up to the hype. The atmosphere and service was great, bt this time around, the food was only OK. We started with the beef tartare, octopus and foie gras torchon. The beef  in the tartare was mixed with crispy rice crackers, topped with bonito flakes and served with nori paper. Put together, the asian flavors way overpowered the beef. The octopus was cooked well and had a nice smokey flavor but lacked acid/heat to balance out the creamy, smokiness of the dish. The foie gras was incredibly sweet and would have made a great dessert but felt out of place as an appetizer.  Our thoughts on the main courses were similar to the appetizers. The pork dish, topped with trout roe and dashi potatoes tasted more like fish than pork. The lamb was OK and the rigatoni was lacking in acid, similar to the octopus. We got the sorbet for desert which was also OK. Our waitress forgot our coffees and when they finally arrived was nice enough to removed them from our bill as an apology. All in all, it seemed like Kevin Sousa was trying to do too much. The manager came over at the end of the meal to ask how things were and we were honest. He was polite and listened to what we had to say. The last kicker was when we got the bill. Part of the wine list is right justified on the page and my 69 year old father had read the bolded number as the price of the bottle of wine. Oh no - that's just the number they assign to the wine. The actual price is on the left - not a natural place for your eye to rest. We had the Molly Dooker wine which my Dad thought was a steal at $45. Nope. It was actually 81 and showed up on the bill that way!",

There was an octopus appetizer that had potential, but it was smothered in a grey sauce with corn....very unappealing. I will not be back.

Food is tasty but, as expected for a restaurant of this caliber, the servings are small and expensive. Foie gras appetizer was delicious. Venison and pork were both very good.  CONS: Service was slow between courses. They have some seating that is lounge seating which makes it a bit harder to eat. I would suspect most people would rather sit at a table so you don't have to bend over to eat but that could just be a matter of opinion.

Both my wife and I felt that the portions were small especially for the price.  We decided to skip the $10 desserts and go to baskin robins instead for ice cream.

The atmosphere is very unique with minimalist furniture and artwork. We sat at the lounge seats which I loved. It's great for young couples. It feels very intimate and you get an unique view of the only steel mill left in the city. The drink list is amazing, they have an extensive wine list which you can tell they put a lot of time into choosing the specific wines. Their seasonal cocktails were also unreal! The food was beautifully presented, you almost didn't want to eat it because you didn't want to ruin the artwork. But it tasted unreal too. My two favorite dishes were the beef tartare appetizer and beef main dish. I could eat both of those every day. Lastly, the staff who worked provided amazing service. Someone different was always checking in and having unique conversation with you. I will definitely be going back for special occasions.",

The biggest one was that we were advised to order 3 entrees to split between the 2 of us, in addition to an appetizer.  This was way too much food and we agreed that it seemed like an upcharge tactic.  To repeat: you do not need to order more than one entree for yourself, the portions are totally normal!    There was also a point-of-sale error that affected us and the couple next to us, too: we noticed an extra entree charge on our bill, pointed it out, and then waited 15-20 minutes before getting a corrected bill and our card back.  I know that these things happen, especially when you're just opening, but the staff didn't seem very apologetic and coupled with the misleading advice above (plus a mid-meal stretch where we tried in vain to get our server's attention) it just didn't seem like they cared very much.  I really enjoyed Salt of the Earth and was looking forward to trying Kevin Sousa's new venture but our experience was disappointing.  While good, I can't say that our meal (beef tartare appetizer and beef, pork, and halbut entrees) was terribly unique or memorable... sorry, I won't be rushing back for a second try.",

    "text": "Went here on a Friday night because we didn't want to cook and I wish we had just stayed home. We tried the rice cakes with tempeh first. Tempeh was good flavor/texture-wise. The rice cakes were \"eh\", I kind of felt like I was eating a cotton swab. We also tried the fluke with gnocchi & wow was it disappointing. The gnocchi was either overboiled by about ten minutes or just terrible to begin with. The gnocchi literally were flavorless mush balls. The fish had no taste really. We also had the scallop with puffed rice which was visually appealing but just OK. Nothing about it stood out aside from the fact that the scallop was fresh.The sunchoke was the only truly delicious dish I had. The flavors in it worked very well and the sunchoke was fried nicely. For the price, I was expecting solid, delicious food and was so disappointed. We didn't finish most of our food due to how lacking it was, which says a lot because the portions are very small. What's more, our server didn't seem to have an interest in us because we were younger than everyone else in the restaurant and weren't dressed to the nines. Will not be going back. Everything looked much better than it tasted.",

First course was the salmon tartare and it was phenomenal. It was so fresh and I thoroughly enjoyed it. For the main course I had the short ribs. Next time I'm there I can't wait to order it again. The beef literally melted in my mouth, paired perfectly with fresh Brussels sprouts and polenta, it was almost like eating a meal at my grandmothers. Dessert called for the Pavlove- an orangey meringue with fermented fruit and blood oranges. Spoke for some time with the manager(?) and he was hilarious and down to earth.  Even had a chance to thank the chef for my wonderful meal. I will definitely definitely be returning very soon.",

    "text": "I am a big Kevin Sousa fan. I very much miss Union Pig & Chicken and miss Salt of the Earth. Union Pig was much more my style of eatery...    This place is probably one of the 5 best restaurants in PIT. That it sits in the shadow of the Edgar Thompson Works, in Braddock, is amazing actually if you know the area. This real estate, just a decade ago, was entirely derelict and quite dangerous. Braddocc Mayor John Fetterman, through the will and force of his personality, has made this entire ZIP code habitable again. I believe he owns the building Superior Motors is in ...   Sousa and his staff create and serve food that is flavorful, challenging, and ... if you enjoy the gourmet experience ... thrilling. I have to admit, that's not my thing at all. This is just not my kind of place. I had a steak dish when it first opened (wish I'd taken better notes, believe it was Argentenian steak of some variety - was excellent) and it was not on the menu when I returned in 12/2017.   Appetizers are all works of art. The only one that I was interested in eating was the beef tartare ... and it was excellent, 5 star.   I have had the pork dish (I don't like caviar with my pig, sorry), and it was good. Very good. I think the presentation and arrangement was superior to the dish itself. Have also had the short rib which was equally stunning. Like wow, this is astounding to behold.    You can BYOB, with a cork fee, which I always appreciate.   I have never had service matching the price of dining here. Never. I don't show up in camp pants and a Penguins jersey either(I know what you were thinking!) I know \"how to eat\" and \"how to order\" at a 5 star restaurant ... the staff here treated me like a rube. Several times, when asking questions about the menu, the server deferred and said \"I'll just let you have more time to review the menu.\" NO, I don't need more time... I need you to answer my question. Good lord. Never encountered that sort of treatment at any of Sousa's other eateries.   Anyway, if you enjoy food as art? You will LOVE this place. If not, you won't. This is a very unique gourmet restaurant that offers truly unique and superior dishes.",

Top hits were Beef Tartare, Brassica and Greens and Gnocci. Main entree favs were Lamb, Beef and Halibut. Great drink selection. We did not have dessert. Shout out to our server Vondre who we loved. He brought us a complimentary Salmon and took us into the kitchen at the end of our meal. Got to see Kevin taking command of the kitchen and it made our night. Highly recommend even if the portions aren't huge as others have mentioned. Great atmosphere, would happily return. Well worth the out of the way trip for this fine dining experience.",

    "text": "Finally got out to Superior Motors - man did it live up to the hype and then some!! Was blown away by how friendly and accommodating the staff was. Before arriving I called to inquire about what entrees could be adjusted for a vegan. The woman on the phone was so happy to walk me through the menu and discuss which items could be adjusted and made vegan (several of them!--basically just omitting the cheese). All the pictures looked so good, so I knew I was in for a treat.   The restaurant itself is so clean, simple and elegant. From big half circle booths, tons of tables, to the bar, and even a back dining area, the restaurant was definitely very large. So nice that my party of four was seated at a large booth and not crammed at a four person table. Our table was ready the second we walked through the doors and our waiter arrived within moments of us sitting down. Definitely would recommend a reservation as it was quite crowded at 5 PM on a Sunday.   Our waiter walked us through the menu and was happy to describe all dishes in further detail. My table ended up ordering the beef entree, sturgeon, and mushroom risotto. Holy heck was the mushroom risotto perfection. The rye and pearl barley was a perfect al dente and really made the meal feel super hearty and filling. It was topped with just two tiny tiny slices of mushroom. My only complaint is compared to both the beef & fish entree which were quite large, the portion size of the risotto was teeny tiny--almost appetizer size. Felt that as being an entree it definitely should have been a bigger portion. Although aside from the size, the taste was absolutely exquisite. It was made vegan by omitting the goat cheese and WOW was it amazing. For dessert they had four options and our waiter advised us the further down the list you go, the less traditional the desserts became. Fortunately the coconut dessert was vegan and also last on the list, it was super unique and so very delicious. We also ordered the pear tart and my party absolutely loved it. So sweet they even put a candle on the dessert for my boyfriend's birthday. Loved everything about our meal here, and I can't wait to get back again in the near future.",

I had a good experience but given the price point I am not rushing back.  The food was uneven -- some very good dishes, some good and many just OK.  There are many better restaurants in Pgh at this price point. And the one glaringly bad moment of the evening was when we asked for some more bread for an appetizer (chicken liver pate) that didn't have a sufficient amount. They replied No, but we could order another appetizer. Not the right answer ever, especially given it would cost them very little and our party spent $700 that evening. Next time I want to splurge, I will choose one of my favorites in Pgh -- Cure, Poulet Bleu, Legume, Butcher in the Rye, or Morcilla.",

I found that a little odd but they were accommodating on changing the time for me. I visited the area late so I do not have a clear opinion  about the area. It seems nice but across this place there is a factory. There is  available parking on both sides of the restaurant and on the street. The ambience  is really nice. To open kitchen concept is very attractive . The staff is nice and our server was a little hyperactive!!! . She was informative though. We had a company of five and I tried the beer which is aged and  my husband tried a cocktail. The drinks were good. The food was a four out of five stars. We had  the steak,   the scallops and the Venison. I tried them all. The presentation was excellent. The pork and the duck were not well prepared. Again the presentation was great and the plate looked fine but the duck had the characteristic smell of an unwell prepared meat. Maybe the chef should remove these plates from the menu. The desserts were very good. Good try chef but not a five star. Sorry. I will not be back.",

One post prohibition made with rye and the other modern. The food was amazing! Plates are small so you can order a bunch for sharing. We started off with the soft shell crab and the shrimp tapenade. The Asian inspired flavor with the crab was delicious. Then had the grass fed filet and the pappardelle pasta. The filet isn't  your typical filet and our server told us that up front along with the fact that it's supposed to be served warm. I love servers who give us a heads up on items. The filet practically melted in my mouth! The pasta was a nice light accompaniment to the filet. We ended up ordering the pretzel salad for dessert. We were told by another server ( waitress) Who delivered our dessert that the mulberries were even picked next-door!  Even the girl server assistant/busser was friendly and helpful.  I cannot wait to come back and try more items!!!",

I started with drinks  the Gin, Mezcal and Tequila cocktails, I had a taste of the Rum and my god they were all so perfect. I think my favorite was the Mezcal. The server that we had was so pleasant and helped a lot with recommendations. Ordering felt like a consultative shopping experience, and whenever they brought the food out, everything was more thoroughly described to us. Guys, before this day, I have never eaten a salad that made me moan out load. The dressing was creamy and complex in flavor, I really couldn't even tell you what it was. The mushrooms melted in my mouth like no mushrooms ever have before... and there were soaked almonds in it which added yet another suprise to my dining experience. I made everyone at the table taste my salad and they looked at me like I was crazy, but after they tasted it, they understood my excitement. Moving on to the seitan... WOAH. I have never dated seitan that had such a smooth and consistent texture. The portion looked small, but seitan is quite filling so those two items were plenty for me to eat without feeling stuffed. I didnt have room for dessert, but I tasted the ice cream dish that they had. Dark chocolate garnishes on and under a lime ice cream. It was SO good and reminded me of imported chocolates that I once had. I think this is a great place for groups, or for a romantic evening with a loved one... leave your kids at home, no one wants to hear them while they're enjoying the tranquility and complexity that this restaurant has to offer.",

    "text": "I'm a long-lost son of Pittsburgh. I grew up in this beat-up Steel Town. I watched jobs evaporate around me at an exponential rate. I saw people around me slip into the use of the needle. Now, I'm a twenty-something year old yuppie who comes back to Pittsburgh six or seven times a year to see my folks. This place is full of nostalgia and is meaningful to me.  As this city climbs out of the ashes, the food scene is rebounding in a really big way. It's truly symbolic watching new cuisines people would have spat at years ago become popular. My old man saw Superior Motors in a Food and Wine magazine article and sent me the link. I thought, \"wow, this place is perfect for me. I'm a snobby millennial who loves this return to greatness story they're promoting.\"   We walked into the joint and I noticed a Tribe Called Quest vinyl out and \"Push it Along\" playing on their phono. I was charmed instantly.   Unfortunately, that and my vermouth were the highlight of the meal. Service was inadequate. It's heartwarming that a large portion of the work force comes from Braddock. But that doesn't compensate for the quality. The waitress gave my dad my drink. Another waitress mixed up our meal orders at the table and didn't bother to even ask. We had to correct her. They were not apologetic either.  The food reminds me of an avant-garde musician you really want to like for their sheer talent and appearances on more conventional artists' records. But you can't enjoy that artist because their aggregated skills put together make for some horrible art.  The individual items are some of my favorites. I had the diver scallops to start the meal. The scallops are served raw, which I generally dig. However, the seasoning was minimal on the scallops and the cuttlefish. I knew going in the texture on the cuttlefish would be a bit chewy but it was one of the worst textural experiences I have had during a meal. Everything is soft in the bowl. They served three pieces of some greens to add some crunch, but they were soggy. The buckwheat noodles in the ink were tasty but again soft. It just was disappointing along several dimensions.   For the main course, I had the duck. This, too, unfortunately was not fantastic. The swiss chard in cashews wasn't overwhelmingly good. It was okay but it wasn't anything I'd seek out again. The duck didn't really seem to fit with the rest of the plate, which included a swiss chard roll with rhubarb inside and pickled strawberries. Pickled strawberries were very unique. But the flavors seemed so random and nothing was cohesive. For the price of the meal, you can get better elsewhere.   Neither my parents nor I are inclined to go back. It looks like Food & Wine got caught up in the personal narrative rather than what was going on in front of them. Braddock is a dead town and even if Pittsburgh comes back bigger than ever, the location will kill this place given the quality of food they're serving. This place needs to step it up or their Kickstarter money is gonna vanish.",

    "text": "I've never ventured out to Braddock before, but I'm glad I did for this place! The vibe in here is so cool. I loved the huge windows in the front that showcase the steel mill across the street. You can tell they put a ton of thought into designing the restaurant.  To drink, I had the \"Punch\". It was very strong - probably a bit too strong for my taste - but still tasty. They were offering a non-vegetarian and vegetarian tasting menu for restaurant week, so we ordered one of each.   We started with a trout and carrot tartar. My favorite of the two was the trout, but the carrot was very unique! You could barely tell that it was carrot because of the smoky flavor. Next was a short rib dish and rice cakes. The short ribs were so tender and rich, and everything else in the dish was really yummy too. The rice cakes were a let down in my opinion, and I probably wouldn't order this one again. Lastly, we had a pasta dish with confit (not sure what type of meat it was) and a mushroom barley risotto dish, both of which were delicious.   We also couldn't help but try two of the desserts (the chocolate and the creme brulee). The chocolate dessert, which was recommended by our waiter, was the highlight of the night and probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. Skip the creme brulee and get two chocolate desserts.   Service was great as well - the waiter was very friendly, attentive, and gave us plenty of time to enjoy each dish. I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

The main room is super loud, our waitress had to scream over the noise, we could barely have a conversation at our booth. When we walked in, the lobby area had about 10 people waiting and staff kept going through the customers to back of house, pushing us all around the room; there was no where to stand to be out of the way.  Totally worth coming, hope they can get their ambience more refined.",

    "text": "My parents first ate here after seeing Superior Motors on Parts Unknown and loved it so much they booked our family after Thanksgiving dinner here for the Saturday after turkey day at 6:30pm. There is street parking but also a small parking area next door which we were able to squeeze into. The decor is very modern industrial-my husband particularly liked how the back of the bar was lit to shine on all of the bottles there.   We were immediately sat upon arrival in a cozy 5 person booth, which was on the dining side opposite from where my parents sat on their original visit. It was not too crowded but I'd recommend reservations since the holiday probably had something to do with the light crowd. Our server came over quickly, gave some menu highlights, and then left us to explore the ever-changing menu.   We ordered a bottle of Cab franc for the table which paired nicely with our (mostly red) meat entrees. I noticed they allow BYOB too but I'm not sure on the corkage fee but just an FYI for those interested. They serve homemade sourdough bread-at a cost-pre meal if requested. We dove straight into appetizers and entrees though. My parents ordered the beef tartare served with seaweed wraps. While enjoyable they said the beef tartare at Union Standard is superior (having never been I cannot share my opinion) but this version was quite spicy. I tried a forkful and thought it was ok, spicy for sure, I'm not a beef tartare fan at all, but my husband finished the dish for them since they were not too impressed. He enjoyed the spicy flavors and found the seaweed wraps to be the perfect way to wrap the tartare up for delivery to the mouth.   For entrees, 3 of us ordered the short rib dish. My mom was highly disappointed they changed the menu and didn't have the steak (best since Argentina she said-which was in February). All of us loved the short rib! The meat was super tender, the bearnaise sauce intermixed with mushroom and onions was the perfect accompaniment for the flavorful short ribs. The polenta was interesting. I'm not familiar with it but this version was in cubes with a cinnamon-like outer coating. The only miss here was the Brussels sprouts which were not cooked thoroughly and were quite hard. My dad ordered the halibut which was served with a miso broth poured on top upon its arrival to the table. Of course, no one got a taste but he said it was unique and delicious. My husband ordered the pork dish, complete with trout roe, and loved it-his plate was the first one cleaned. For dessert my husband and I shared the chocolate dessert as did my mom and dad. It was really, um, interesting. I'm a purist with chocolate so I wish the lower layer of the black sesame patty had not been there because the adzuki ice cream with chocolate ganache and the cherries was delicious! My brother ordered the panna cotta, which I wasn't able to try, but since he finished it all, that probably meant he gave his approval of the dessert.   Portions are just right-don't expect to leave overstuffed or hungry. I really enjoyed my dining experience at Superior Motors and, while it's in an area that is probably inconvenient for most of Pittsburgh, I'd still recommend taking the drive to Braddock for a superior dining experience!",

The wait staff was super friendly and attentive and our waiter even gave us a tour of the kitchen after our meal. Also, the drinks are AMAZING. Definitely order the \"punch\" because it's a truly beautiful drink.   Now the food...  ...everything was beautiful. I can't say enough about the presentation. However our table of 4 ordered upwards of 12 dishes and my husband and I didn't love any of them. I ordered the duck as my entree and couldn't finish it. I basically choked down a few bites because it was so expensive and I didn't want to waste it. It would have helped had the preparation method for each item been described briefly on the menu as this would have better guided my ordering decision. This food just wasn't for us...maybe that's because my taste isn't sophisticated enough for this stuff. What's worse is that this dinner was NOT cheap. So we spent a small fortune on a bunch of dishes, left unsatisfied, and drove through Wendy's on the way home.   We'd go back for drinks but not for dinner.",

They were nice enough, but may need time to perfect their new trade. Our waitress was not the most attentive and frequently forgot to refill water.   I thought the food so good. We had for starters the octopus. Which was nothing less than amazing. The preparation just fit so perfectly with the taste of the meat. The raw scallops were so tasty and last was the foie gras. It was sweeter, almost like a foie gras pie; but delicious.  For our mains my wife had the beef and I had the lamb. Both meats were cooked to perfection. I think the beef was better, it has a nice smoked flavor. The lamb was good, but the preparation was so delicious.   They had a nice wine selection, maybe a few to many roses. The cocktails were great. The beer selection left a little to be desired. I always wonder why beer is so plain at these places. Where are the DIPA's and imperial stouts?",

Superior Motors is in a very edgy neighborhood and the contrast (a pretentious restaurant in a neighborhood peppered with shootings/stabbings just blocks away) felt very off-putting and voyeuristic to me.    I will say that I love the decor and was really impressed by all the artwork. I wish the creativity was translated into the food. We had the duck, pork, and beef. I thought the composition of the pork dish was very focused, but did not understand why they plated the entire dish in one corner of a plate. It helps sometimes to spread the ingredients out and allow them to breathe a little. I also wasn't too excited about the marmalade that accompanied the duck.   To finish, I had the tart, which was an interpretation of key lime pie. I thought the dessert had really good balance. I love it when a dessert is rich and satisfying but doesn't taste sweet.   Overall I'd say I have mixed feelings about this place. It is a very unique experience, but could be so much more.",

Superior Motors is such a gem nestled in the rough. Truly, I was absolutely blown away after my first bite. Wow. Everything we had here was just outstanding.   I came here during restaurant week so I think my portions were a little smaller than usual (so don't be discouraged by my pictures of such small plates). Because of this, I was able to sample three absolutely phenomenal dishes as well as the full plates my husband ordered. Ocean trout tartare, fried squid, sage cavatelli, beef, and veal. Of these, my favorite was the fried squid and if I had to pick my least favorite, it'd be the veal. Overall, though, each dish was so inventive, intricate, and absolutely stunning.   Overall, Superior Motors is a very well-thought-out restaurant. The whole experience here is definitely worth the trek to Braddock!",

We were told we had to order all 3 courses at once so the food was timed properly, but the joke was on us! The food came out cold and like it was a food dish double in \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\". We could get more fish off a baby goldfish!! No flavor in any of the dishes except the steak tartar which was actually very good.  The cocktails were below average, super short pours and nothing special.  The service is inexperienced and not attentive which appear to be culinary students with no oversight. Over 20 mins between courses with nobody to be found.  The manager was very nice when we expeessed our concerns. He's great and a good restaurant should pick him up. 13/10 do not recommend this restaurant. For the cost, expect I expected amazing but this restaurant did not deliver it, not even close.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Thursdays ago with my wife and my parents for my birthday dinner.  Superior Motors is one of those restaurants that I have been looking forward to trying ever since it was introduced maybe 3 years ago.  The slow progress of building it and its location in Braddock meant that it wasn't a place to head to for just any meal.  That's why I waited until my birthday to give it a try.  We had reservations for 7:15 and arrived to the restaurant right around that time.  It was busy inside and we waited about 15 minutes for our table to open up. Whoever it was that was working the front of the house on this day, you could tell he was really busting his butt doing anything he could to help the servers and hostess.  I loved seeing that!  In any case, the inside of the restaurant is certainly interesting.  The walls are brick which gives it an industrial feel and then there are paintings on the wall which my mom thought elementary school students could do. Haha.  They were better than that but certainly more of the abstract variety.  For dinner on this evening I decided to start off with the crispy pig face appetizer while the rest of the table decided to split the smoked seitan.  The menu described my crispy pig face as coming with vegetarian boudin noir (not sure how that works), black truffle and mustard while the seitan came with popcorn, mango and spruce.  Both were beautiful whenever they came to our table.  My crispy pig face ended up being quite good as it was fried into a rectangular object which ended up having a really intense pork flavor to it.  I especially enjoyed dipping it into the mustard.  Last but certainly not least was the boudin noir which sort of had the consistency and flavor profile of stove top stuffing although not exactly the same. I was also able to try some of the smoked seitan and loved both the smokiness of it and the mango on top of it.  Then for my entree I went with the duck while my wife ordered the salmon.  My duck came with Swiss chard, cashew and rhubarb while my wife's salmon came with white asparagus, sorrel, hazelnut and hollandaise.  I was especially excited about mine as duck and rhubarb are too of my favorite flavors and you so rarely see them together.  Thankfully it didn't disappoint as my meal was delicious.  The duck ended up coming two ways with probably a half of a breast as well as some confit and both parts were cooked perfectly.  Meanwhile the cashew added some texture to the dish while the rhubarb added that sweetness and sourness that it is known for.  My only complaint about the dish was that there wasn't more of it, haha.  My wife and parents also really enjoyed all of their dishes.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Superior Motors really lives up to its wait for me as all of the food was beautifully plated and delicious.",

Rye punch with the luxardo cherry and orange peel was light and herbacious and oh-so satisfying.  Absolute bests: * Braised lamb with hidden crisped sweetbreads and an orange sauce that, I swear, originated from an angel * Fried pig's head with blood pudding was an umami explosion, like a tiny bite of the entirety of your mom's Christmas dinner, rolled into one. * Peekytoe Crab with fresh, sweet corn was the most gentle, sweet, cool, palate-cleansing dish I have ever had * Veal with rhubarb was such an innovative flavor pairing, meant to be, more compatible than Kristen Bell and Dax Shepherd; has reignited my interest in both ingredients. * Pretzel Salad was both comforting and elevated and completely blew my mind * THE YUZU GANACHE OMG OMG OMG OMG uh, normally, the dessert isn't supposed to be the best part of the meal, but the ganache was impossibly silky and the yuzu ice cream was utterly sublime.  Complaining for no reason, other than it's expected on Yelp: The only ones that I could have taken or left were the korean rice cakes, black cod and the cobia, which would have been both objectively outstanding anywhere else, but the bar was raised too damn high. (and in the case of korean rice cakes, I just think that I like them cheap and dumb.  Like at all-you-can-eat KBBQ-style.  It felt so wrong eating fancy ones).  Server was charming and so knowledgeable - we asked for a white wine recommendation that would work with our entire meal, and he smartly advised us to the Viogner, which was meaty and present and golden and worked with literally everything.  We regretted not getting the duck because the wine had a hint of game in it that would have sent us through the roof.  I would honestly take a special trip back to Pittsburgh, just to enjoy this establishment once again.  Hard success, great business - I'd give it more than five stars if I could.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Superior Motors for an epic date night that we will long remember. I prefaced the visit by calling and speaking with Chris Clark, the GM, who asked a few questions about our preferences and then spoke to Chef Sousa. My request was that we didn't want to make any decisions - that we wanted to be surprised and eat until we busted open.  We went a bit early, which I highly recommend, so we could walk around a bit. SM is located directly across the street from the USS Mon Valley Works Edgar Thomson Plant. I loved that the restaurant really fits into its surroundings and does not overwhelm the neighborhood. Arriving early will also give you a chance to check out the interior and grab a drink.  Chris met us when we arrived; and, knowing how busy the reservation book was, recommended that we just sit at the bar. This couldn't have been a more spot on recommendation for us, as we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The bartenders were not just friendly but awesome wait staff themselves. They paired all of our dishes with the perfect choices of IPA, prosecco, saki, and a Greek red wine.  The food...oh, the food...  We started with what turned out to be the only challenging dishes for the both of us. My husband had the diver scallop with buckwheat noodles and cuddlefish ink. I had the cobia, with freeze dried avocado noodles (YUM! I could eat a whole bowl!), and a tomatillo/jalapeno/cilantro broth. What was challenging for the both of us was just that we hadn't ever had such unique raw seafood preparations before - so it was just an overwhelming starter - but delicious nevertheless.  For the next course, I had black cod with sunchokes, kale, and leek. I'll mention here that Chef Sousa's dishes are always loaded with fresh veg - and the veg are always prepared with multiple cooking techniques to keep the flavors and textures constantly evolving based on what's on your fork next. My husband had the salmon, with white asparagus, sorrel, hazelnut, and a hollandaise. Again, the textures and flavors here were morphed with every bite.  For the next course, I had a chicken dish that was so reminiscent of my Nana's funsei (a South American dish) that I got all choked up with nostalgia - but I still managed to gobble down what was an outstanding chicken dish. My husband had the veal with ricotta, asparagus, and fiddleheads. What an incredible combination of meat, cheese, and veg! I could have eaten a whole platter of this.  Overall, Chris and Chef Sousa picked the ideal combination of dishes for us: challenging, comforting, and downright delicious all around. At this point, we were pretty full from cruising through the menu; however, the pasta was calling to me...  We ordered one last savory course to share - the house made pappardelle with egg, watercress, and cauliflower. As a carnivore myself, I couldn't have loved this veg dish more. It was like the great red wine we were sipping: delicate and still packing a bold flavor punch.  Any regular diner would have thrown in the napkin - but not us! We finished our journey with the ganache, yuzu, lime dessert. Chocolate with citrus is probably one of my favorite combos so I was a happy camper.   I will warn the frugal spender: Superior Motors is quite pricey; however, you 100% get what you pay for, which, in this case, is superior service, libations, and food. And if that's not enough, remember what Chef Sousa is doing for the neighborhood and Braddock Youth Project kids; about how he both reclaimed and re-visioned the history of the building itself; and, the fact that products are sourced from area vendors.  It is easy to see why 'Food & Wine' considers Superior Motors to be the Restaurant of the Year. I look forward to seeing Chef Sousa continue to grow. Cheers!",

Our server, Erin, was warm, cheerful and informative, answering all our questions with aplomb.   We were first served a free celebratory glass of champagne and settled down to one of the best meals of our lives.  The Bourbon Cocktail, flavored with coffee rum, was a delicious starter.   We started with the Beef Tartare, served on a perfect cracker-like bread, and the Crispy Pig Face (no it's not shaped like a face or a pig), savory pork with a beautiful berry and mustard sauce.  For our main, I had the Duck entree, perfectly flavored and cooked to a sublime medium rare, while my wife had the Grass Fed Beef, so tender it melted.  I don't recall the details of our dessert, but let's just say it was a perfect topper to the meal.  We were treated at the end to an \"anniversary\" tour of the kitchen. Fascinating!  It was a great experience all around. The staff was awesome, the food sublime.We will definitely return!",

    "text": "We had been waiting YEARS for superior motors to open, and by the time it had, we had already moved away! Fortunately, we we able to make time to come out here on our last trip to Pittsburgh.   The food was delicious. I loved Salt of the Earth, and was really looking forward to Kevin Sousa's next venture. In our group we had the octopus, hamachi, almost all the entrees and the pavlova and bread pudding desserts, and saw him working in the open concept kitchen while we were enjoying our meal.  A couple things:  I had issues with our main waitress throughout the night. We were in a group of 6 and we ask a lot of questions when it comes to food and satisfying everyone's palette. She came off and very condescending and more like we were intruding on her restaurant, rather than welcoming us to share this experience with her. We did not feel like sentiment with other waiters and waitresses who came by to collect plates. This was very off-putting and there was really nothing we could do about it.   Cocktails were not good. My watermelon gin drink tasted like watered down gin. I had one sip and didn't touch it for the rest of the night. I had hoped that our waitress would notice and offer a new one but  it just sat there full until our check came. Our general experience with her for the entire night was really bizarre.   The interior decor is really nice but the elevated tables around the perimeter of the restaurant have HUUUUGE tables. Really nice and spacious but hard to reach certain plates. Also when our waitress handed us new plates in between I went to grab mine but she wouldn't let go and stared at me during this power play until I let go so SHE could put my plate down. So weird.   I want to say that the food was worth the money but this particular experience, having to deal with our waitress, was not. I hope to give SM another chance, but don't feel particularly inclined to.",

The fact is that a restaurant can serve the most innovative, flawlessly prepared food, but it won't matter if the experience is tainted.   We decided to celebrate my grandmother's 93rd birthday here, and brought a cake to celebrate. Well, I guess a write up in the New York Times means you don't have the time or the willingness to cut the cake for your guests. Instead we were met with a \"we don't serve outside food. The manager should have told you.\" This was after the manager took the cake himself and refrigerated it for us! I get it, you're riding high from your review, but lest you forget, this is a customer service industry and continuing to promote an attitude of \"we can't be bothered because we're so amazing\" will not work forever.   People want to be treated like you care even a little bit about them, not to be treated like the next person in line needs to be sat at our table. The food almost becomes an accessory to the experience when you foster a culture of pretentious and cold treatment. Unfortunately it's not the quality of the food that I'm taking with me from the experience; rather, the almost nonexistent customer service.",

However we were able to snag a table and dine and the food was fantastic.  We sampled the chicken thigh, gnocchi, and crab as well as the yogurt cake for dessert and coffee.  Everything was so different and the tastes equally interesting.  It would have been nice to have bread to dip into the remaining sauce but the waitress said that their restaurant \"tends to cater to those that want to avoid carbs.\"   I like SM for a restaurant experience where I can have just enough and it's interesting.

Superior Motors is challenging, flavorful, thrilling and thoughtfully conceived. If you are not interested in being challenged by new flavors and provocative food expressions...save your money and go elsewhere. But if you would like to try bold flavor combinations and an adventure in dining, by all means, don't miss eating here.   The dining room is carefully laid out, and it does not feel crowded. Our server was attentive and passionate. She was obviously well trained and loves her job. We gave her a ridiculous 40% tip and she earned every penny.   Each dish led to some new discovery. Not just, novelty, however, but, gratifying, refreshing and delicious.   So I really miss Salt of the Earth, it was my favorite restaurant. However Superior Motors is...well, superior!",

Drink served with a ton of crushed ice in a short glass should have been served with a skinny straw so you don't get ice all over your face with every sip. Lamb and chicken were delicious. Grouper was bland and the potato came out cold. Beef was okay but had a bug in it from not cleaning the mushrooms well enough. They gave us that entree for free and then tried to make nice by \"giving us a tour of the place\" which involved the manager letting us walk 5 feet into the kitchen. The manager then proceeded to make my aunt feel bad for not telling him that she didn't enjoy her meal before we paid and said there was now nothing he could do about it. (How about a \"here's an appetizer for free on us next time\", buddy?). I was super excited for the desserts but the pavlova was cloyingly sweet and the pound cake was just okay. Also, poor choice on the faucet selection in the bathrooms. 3 of the 4 at our table couldn't figure out how to get water from it and once they figured it out had to help 2 other strangers with it too. That's a whole bunch of disappointment in one night. Hopefully they can pull it together to make some improvements and live up the hype.",

It took a while for SM to open, then it was featured on Anthony's Bourdain and that discouraged me to go because I figured it would be packed with curious followers of the CNN show. But I was dragged there by friends on a night out. Glad I was. Atmosphere is great, they did an amazing job with the decoration. Instead of hiding the views to an old USS steel mill across the street they actually integrated into the restaurant using large glass windows. The result is pretty amazing, a surreal view of an old, grim, dark part of the neighborhood from the modern, cozy and warm dinning area of the restaurant. Food and service are great as expected from Kevin and his team, I had venison for the first time ever and it was delicious. We were a large group and the consensus was it is pretty damn good.

They recommended drinks, food, etc.  Now...regarding the food.  All the yum was happening during restaurant week. (And all the time!)  It was suggested that we add one more side - which we did.  If you are visiting Superior Motors I highly suggest getting the smoked potatoes.  I believe they change them with the seasons - but they (as they have been in the past) are my absolute favorite.  I will order them every single time i visit - restaurant week or not.    All the additional food for restaurant week was amazing (it always is!) Superior motors never disappoints.  You should be there, Now.",

A local garden in Braddock, where the restaurant is located, provides the produce. The dishes are simple but bold in flavor. The preparations allow the flavors of the fresh ingredients to come through. He trains and hires many local young people from Braddock, an economically challenged area. It's a great concept and dining experience.  We had the restaurant week prix fixe. Everything was cooked to perfection. I had the NY Koji strip steak, my wife had the scallops. Both were great (see the photos for the descriptions of the food).",

The atmosphere is industrial warehouse beautifully designed, looking out across the street at an old US Steel plant. So I guess it fits in the vibe.   It features a tapas focused menu. The problem with tapas for us is that we never really leave full without dropping plenty of coin. And with 4 people having 2 rounds of $12 cocktails it pumps up the bill quickly. That said the quality, taste and and presentation was very good.   While I might recommend it For the experience, I doubt that we would return.",

I would put the space, the vibe and the food up against any restaurant in any other city - NYC, Chicago, etc. Because it's pricey, I probably won't take the whole family there as often as I'd like, but hope to go back soon with my husband.   August 2019 Restaurant Week Update: We try to visit Superior Motors for every Restaurant Week. I have no complaints about the quality of the food or the service (or the cocktails). But the portion sizes were small by comparison to past Restaurant week offerings. This is not a problem for me, because I tend to prefer smaller plates, but overall this was not so much of a \"deal\" like we have experienced in the past at  Superior Motors or at other fine restaurants this year. If I were rating the meal I had tonight, overall I would give it four and one-half stars for the small portions.",

The cheese with bread and dried fruits was good, but not anything special or worth trying here. I thought the shrimp appetizer was interesting - it came with corn salad and \"compressed\" watermelon, and seemed very well thought out in terms of flavor combination and plating. However, it didn't taste as good as the concept seemed and the whole idea of compressed watermelon was just kind of funny to me.  I had the salmon dish as my entree, and I really enjoyed it. The salmon was very crispy on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. The dish included salad, pickled foods, and grains, and had a really nice balance of salty, savory, and sweet. A lot of the menu seemed to have influences from Asian cuisines, and I thought the food was very unique.",

There were 3 of us and we had a total of 8 dishes (including 1 side dish and 2 desserts) and our total was $160. We were all completely full after also.  To start we got the soup, the beef tartar and the gnocchi. All were Incredible. I was really wanting the tuna tartar but they were out of tuna so that was a bummer. But still it was amazing. The gnocchi was out of this world. I wanted 6 plates of it. For entrees we had the pork belly, salmon, chicken, and a side of potatoes. The salmon was the only dish we didn't like. None of us liked it really. The flavors were a bit odd and very very bitter.   Dessert we had a chocolate fudge type thing with popcorn crumbles on it(my fave) and the yogurt cake.   Honestly I'll go back without a question. I do wish the place was a little more inviting. The host was kinda eh, and the servers were nice but kinda felt a bit cold.",

Trendy, eclectic restaurant in an otherwise poor and lifeless area--the road is rather bumpy and there is basically absolutely nothing else around (but I bet their rent is cheap!).  I didn't come particularly hungry, so I had a small dish with some apricot, cheese, and some more goodness. It was light and fruity, basically exactly what I was looking for. And the entree was a beef dish with some asparagus and some other veggies around it, with two different sauces including a mole sauce. Both dishes were tasty, and the beef in particular was cooked very nicely. For the quality the price is reasonable.  The place is so far out of the way of anything else that I'd say you should go when you're in the mood for a ride--and have confidence in your tires.",

We got, in order of favorite to least, the kimchi rice cakes, potatoes, carrots with cheese and hazelnuts, and seitan with beets and lentils. The seitan was pretty un-special, but you can get a meat option (\"sweetbreads\") which is maybe worth the money. These were the only 4 vegetarian options on the menu that day.  We also got a mushroom-infused chocolate cake, which I again found not as exciting as I expected. I did love a lot of things!! The staff was exceptional, and service was so speedy. They have a special pairing where they pair two wines made with the same grape from different vineyards- this time one was from South Africa and one from Texas! That was great and delicious. I also loved the atmosphere inside and that they labeled the vegan options.  Overall, I wouldn't make the drive out from Pittsburgh again when there are tons of vegetarian options close to home.",

There were four savory dishes that progressively got better. The first dish was green apple bonito sorbet with tuna and uni. I have to say, it was not enjoyable at all. The food tasted really fresh and the presentation was beautiful. However, the flavors did not blend and it just tasted like ice cream and fish. The second dish, was burnt toast ice cream and celeriac. This dish was tasty however, the ice cream just seemed like it was thrown into to dish. The edamame ice cream dish was next and included venison tartare. This dish was good however, the venison was a little too spicy for my liking. The final dish was the foie gras ice cream with squab. The squab was cooked a little too rare however, the foie gras ice cream was very rich and full of flavor.   The two desserts were the best part of the meal. The flavor blended very well. There were really good flavors and textures.    Atmosphere: the dining room has an industrial feel inside. Looking outside the window, there is a steel factory across the street. This was really beautiful aesthetically but concerning once you I outside the restaurant. The air smelled funny and a little nauseating.   I will review this place again, once I dine and enjoy their regular menu. For being best restaurant according Pittsburgh magazine, along with other accolades, I was expecting more.",

We came during restaurant week because I've been dying to make it out that way- and what better time?  I'll start by saying that the staff is incredible. The host, our server, everyone was warm and welcoming.   The restaurant week menu consisted of a potato appetizer, a steak, and a chocolate dessert. There was also a \"specialty\" drink for restaurant week.   To start, the rule was if one of us ordered the restaurant week menu, everyone at the table had to order it as well. Like, what? How is that even a thing- and if it is, why is that not mentioned in their restaurant week advertising? What if I just drove my vegetarian friend 35 mins, and now no one can order any restaurant week foods because there is only one option and it's meat?  The steak was chewy and gross - even my husband wouldn't finish mine. The potato appetizer ended up being the highlight. Such a disappointment.  Then, they are out of their specialty drink- okay, there is a replacement and it sounds decent. End of the story is that I paid $11 for a substitute drink that was basically water with a slice of pineapple.  Only cool part was the friendly staff and the fact that they display the record of the music that is playing at the time.  I was so angry that I got fancied up, drove all the way across Pittsburgh, only to be disappointed.",

The wait (even though we had a reservation) was annoying, the waiter asked us 15 times if our mediocre dishes were okay, and in the end after ordering an app, an entree and a dessert, I was still hungry (and I generally don't eat a lot).  Also I'm not sure why our dessert for a toddler came on a giant plate?",

    "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with fine dining.   On one hand, I love the creative and bold flavors, the multiple courses, and the superior service.  On the other, everything is so delicious that I want more of it, and fine dining always has such small portions.  Superior Motors sort of bridges the gap for me on this.  All of the dishes I tried were delightful and expertly put together.  And while I did want more of some of the most tasty of items (just because I'm a glutton), I wasn't hungry at the end of my meal.     First, the service.  I was really pleasantly surprised by this.  They definitely have a fine dining feel with lots of servers and a lot of attention to detail, but without all the stuffy pretentiousness that usually comes with it.   Coat check was available and easy.  The servers knew their stuff and were very attentive without being intrusive.  I never wanted for a refill and they helped with selections on wine.  They even got the little stuff, like pulling out my chair when I went to the restroom.  Everyone looked happy to be there and it showed in the service.      In addition to the menu, they offered a 3 and 5 course option. Several of the dishes in this option were not on the regular menu.   I selected the 3 course option and added the salmon crudo and the smoked banana dessert from the regular menu.  This essentially gave me the 5 course meal with a different dessert and for a few bucks less than the 5 course option.  The meal came to around $65 and I had several glasses of wine on top of that.   I spent more at Lautrec and was far less satisfied there.     Each course was beautiful and absolutely delicious.  The chestnut soup was creamy and warm - I wanted more of that.   The truffle risotto was a very nice second course.   The salmon crudo perhaps could have used a little acid or something, but we are splitting hairs there.   The braised beef was tender and covered with a mole that packed in the flavor.  This also came with some parsnips and a sweet potato puree - both were delicious and I wanted more of those.   I ended with the smoked banana dessert, which was a strange combination of flavors and textures that really worked.   The ganache and sweet potato desserts were also outstanding.    So why four stars instead of five?  Two things.  First, I generally object to having to pony up a credit card to make a reservation.  I absolutely get why they do it, BUT it does make me think twice about making a reservation for 6 people.   While I would love to think my friends are as responsible as I am, the reality is that stuff happens and I don't really want to be on the hook for all of them.    Second (this is really where they lost the star) is the requirement that the entire table do the special multi-course menu or no one can.  I went with a group of 6 ladies - that's 5 other people I had to get on board if I wanted that menu.  One vegetarian or picky eater or cheapskate in the group would have spoiled it for everyone.  The server said it was something to do with the timing of the courses, but I'm just not sure how that's a thing.  Each of us could have made completely random 3-4-5 course meals from the regular menu, so I'm not sure why those particular dishes were harder somehow.    In the end, while I was annoyed that my companions were a little pressured into their food choices, the meal was delicious and the service was great.   I'd go back.",

    "text": "We went on Thursday night for the five course tasting menu.  FYI - If one person at your table gets the tasting menu, the whole table (or in our case the two of us at the bar) has to do the tasting menu.  Kind of a weird requirement, but ok.    I think the biggest problem this place has is that expectations have been set EXTREMELY high.  \"Food and wine magazine!\"  \"Anthony Bourdain!\"  You go in expecting some of the best, most innovative food you've ever had in your LIFE.   Were any of the dishes we had \"AMAZING\"?  No.  They were fine.  Everything was \"fine.\"  Fancy presentation, but at the end of the day course four was still half a chicken breast with a dollop of greens.  The first course was some arugala with half a strawberry and 2 cubes of rhubarb.  It was fine.  The staff never asked if we were enjoying a course - but did seem to notice that I didn't like the fish course because at the end he mentioned it and took a drink off the tab to make up for it (which was nice!).  But at the end of the day, after drinks and tip, a $200 dinner for 2 that took 2 hours?  \"It was fine.\"",

    "text": "Having been a huge fan of this chef's previous restaurants as well as being a frequent customer at Brew Gentlemen right down the street, I'm surprised it took me as long as it did to finally make my way to the ambitious Superior Motors.    It should be mentioned that the venue itself is aesthetically stunning. The bar area has a much warmer and relaxing vibe to it compared to the smaller and somewhat cramped side dining room where we were seated though, but that's a minor complaint.    Food wise, my friends and I ordered pretty much everything on the menu and enjoyed every one of the dishes that came out.  The standouts for me were the duck and venison.    Side note:  It seems like the question regarding how much to order comes up a lot here.  The protein dishes were surprisingly larger than what I was expecting, and I would think that one could get by ordering a protein and appetizer per person. Of course I would recommend ordering whatever interests you, drinking a bunch of their amazing cocktails (bourbon one was fire), and worrying about how much money you spent another day.  Superior Motors is such a unique and interesting  place that you should take as much of it in as you can during your visit.",

    "text": "Chef Kevin Sousa's  2018 award winning restaurant sits in the middle of an old neighborhood in Braddock, PA in what was once a Chevy dealership. The eclectic farm to table menu is laid out differently than most restaurants that we've been to.  Parking is free either on the street or in what was once known as the dealership's parking lot. When we arrived we were seated promptly and a very friendly and helpful waiter guided us through the menu and answered any questions we had. He explained to us that in creating the menu they deviated from the traditional style of appetizers, salads, mains, etc to more of a four course selection where you can pick and choose whatever you wanted. The first page is the entire food menu. The pages that follow it consists of your wine or alcoholic beverages. They have a full bar here.  Anything marked with a \"v\" on the menu meant the item was vegetarian but could be made vegan upon request. I began with the carrot tartare that came with seaweed wraps. My husband had the smoked potato with radish. I was literally blown away with how good that carrot tartare was! Even wrapping portions of it in the seaweed made it more delectable. I tasted my husband's smoked potato and wasn't overly impressed with it.   After completing these items I had discussed with the waiter about the main courses. Everything is cooked to perfection however, be aware of the fact that the inside of most of the dishes can be under cooked.  I say this only to point out the fact that they give that warning about consuming raw or undercooked foods at the bottom of the menu.  I originally wanted the salmon but learning that they could not prepare it well done I then settled for the veal with ricotta, asparagus, and fiddleheads. My husband went with the chicken where he was given two thighs along with morels, endive, and hickory. We waited a bit for our food but it had a nice presentation. I found the veal tender but wasn't used to the preparation. On the other hand I was literally blown away by the fiddleheads. They look like round asparagus and are seasonal to this time of year. My husband told me he enjoyed his chicken meal.  Needless to say the two items we ordered literally were filling enough so we had to pass on dessert. The menu is online and does change weekly. It is located across the street from the Edgar Thompson works. It makes a great place to go for a special occasion. Dress is casual.",

Friend also got it.  I didn't eat mine - we both said we should have sent it back.  Tile fish was cooked properly, but lacked any real direction. Carrots were an interesting pairing - but didn't come off well.  My wife seemed to enjoy the beef - but later admitted she was just being nice (she's awesome).  I passed on dessert and opted for a cup of coffee - I think the coffee was a hold over from the old car dealership...  because that's what it tasted like.  @ $250 a couple I would have hoped for a more impressive culinary experience.  Service was good - dude was a little dry, but that's cool...  He knew the menu and handled the table well.  One of our friends happened to have a couple of $$$ cocktails and he delicately asked how we'd like him to split the bill (twice) - we confirmed splitting it 3 ways was just fine (which it totally was)...  But it was considerate to all how he executed it.     Displaying the vinyl playing is a cool idea.  Hadn't listed to a Radiohead Kid A all the way through for a while - so that worked.  But in general... Superior Motors just feels like it's trying too hard.  A little less \"scene\" and a little more execution please...  Next.",

I was not disappointed - from the greeting when we walked in the door to the fancy tap in the bathroom on my way back out the door, it was a great experience. The food is very fancy and elaborate so not for every day, but everything was so beautifully prepared and presented I definitely will put Superior Motors on my 'must return' list. The ambience is great. The restaurant is beautiful to look at and despite the polished concrete everywhere, the noise level is surprisingly comfortable. The seating was made for lingering and the bar was beautiful. We had the crab and rice cakes to start, followed by the halibut and pork as mains. All was delicious and beautifully composed. The wine suggestion was great, along with the Maggie's Farm coffee liqueur. Finally, we had the chocolate, panna cotta and Pavlova for dessert - all delicious.

    "text": "Somewhere I read that dining at Superior Motors was not about having a meal but rather having an experience. It sounded sort of cliche, especially since it hadn't been announced that there would be a live band or some other form of entertainment. So I couldn't imagine what was supposed to be so experiential until...the people. And by the people I mean Kevin Sousa's team. This is the most amazing, energetic, diverse, people-type people I've experienced in a restaurant or even the service industry altogether. And I love that many of these folks are native Braddock residents! From the hostess to Kevin himself, the team connected with customers and made an experience out of a meal. Such genuinely friendly and outgoing personalities. And did I mention how the food is ridiculously succulent and unique and just beyond...just beyond... When I read the description of each menu item, I wondered who on earth thinks of pairing this stuff together? But once I tasted the food, I was truly amazed, and, being a part of a large party, I tasted nearly everything on the menu!   My daughter who likes anything but the basics fell in love with the octopus and the beef! That's a huge testament of the taste and quality of the food.   And the cocktails...who the heck is Jeremy and where has he been all of my life?! I've hated any form of whiskey anytime I've tasted it but the Rye cocktail with blackberries and chocolate mint (another crazy combination) is one that I sucked down like a sailor. So so smooth and simply delish! I can't say that I'm now a whiskey drinker but I will have that drink at Superior Motors anytime. I'll actually be going back because I'm curious to see if he can deliver on his promise to ensure that I enjoy a Gin cocktail just as much! Can hardly wait to find out.   On top of all of this, and unlike any other restaurant I know of, Superior Motors is investing in Braddock community members through a culinary training program so that they will be a part of building their own community rather than being left behind, or pushed out. This means that you get to not only eat well and drink well but also do well but supporting a business that supports the community.   Kudos to Sousa and his team for silencing the naysayers and delivering on the promise to create a memorable, meaningful experience for patrons.",

First course included a tasty beet salad and a not so impressive Asian rice cake with peanut dressing option.    Second courses were delicious.  Pork and Salmon.    Desserts were also tasty.  The wait staff was great from top to bottom and I really enjoyed the space......with one exception.  The bathroom was rather \"exposing\" and the combination faucet/hand dryer splashed water from the sink onto my pants.",

Everything we ordered was delicious and unique. Highly recommend the short ribs and polenta, the octopus was divine, as was the beef tartare. Definitely going back!",

I can not recommend enough the octopus and fois torchon. The octopus paired with huilchuile and jalapeno really rounded out the palate to a Mexicano inspired umami.  The fois was perfection, there is something delightfully creamy about their preparation and pairing with cherries perfectly balanced this dish. For our entrees we enjoyed the pork with sassafras and roe, the pork would have developed greater flavor with more seasoning. The sweetbread pasta with shrimp read as an thoughtful combination but as the sweetbreads were fried they felt a deconstructed mismatch in a typical spring rigatoni, tasted fine but lacked wow. In close, after our entrees were cleared, we were eager to try dessert but after waiting 15 minutes and waving down  our bar server to return we opted to take the check instead. We will return in hopes of more amazing appetizers. Sousa is on to something...",

    "text": "As a disclaimer, the only reason I'm leaving a three star review is because of the service. The food is spectacular and I would recommend suffering the poor service to have the experience. We came in for an early dinner in December for our friends birthday. There was four of us and our bill was roughly $400 which is definitely not inexpensive for Pittsburgh. However, the quality of the food and drink definitely justifies the price. That being said, I assume a certain level of service when I choose to spend that amount of money in a restaurant. We sat around 7:00pm and we were one of the first few tables in the restaurant. We were rushed to place our order when trying to decide between the four of us which dishes we would like to share. After placing our order, we asked for our pasta dishes and entrees be brought out in separate courses. Every course came out at once, despite repeating the request three times for them to come out separate. We also ordered 4 appetizers, only 3 of which were brought to the table. When we had finished the first three and brought it to her attention that we never got the fourth one we ordered her response was \"oh yeah\". It then came out with the pastas and entrees which we had asked to come in separate courses. This all would have been excusable but we were still charged for the appetizer that our server forgot to order and arrived to our table 20 minuets late. Despite all that I would still recommend the restaurant to others. It's just unfortunate because I'm sure that I am not the only one to have this type of experience.",

Questions about the menu seemed to be a bother.  Our waiter never bothered to check on us, offer dessert and dropped the check on the table while walking by.  I seriously wanted to walk into the kitchen to let Kevin know, cause his wonderful food is being tainted by absolutely horrendous service.  If you even wanted to call it service.

I've heard mixed reviews on the staff, I really don't have much to say on the matter.  They were nice enough, that's about it.  We ordered beers, so I can't speak to the drinks for our visit.  The meal was phenomenal.  We ordered the rice cake appetizer, and the variety of textures and tastes were delightful.  I ordered the pork and he ordered the venison.  Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Again, the variety of tastes and textures in the dishes were remarkable.  I ordered the chocolate dessert and he ordered the pavlova, this is where our experiences differed.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dessert, his was just OK and I wouldn't recommend it, very singular in its flavor.  But, overall I would not say that detracted from the experience.  The coffee was also above average.  I would recommend this restaurant to any one looking for an elegant dining experience.",

Favorites were the tartare, pork belly and the steak, but all delicious.  Drink menu was stellar.  My partner in crime started with a local ipa on draft (he was driving, so I got to taste more), and I had some of my bartender's creative cocktails.  Vodka w tomato water was delicious and refreshing.  Mezcal also intelligently created and so good!  Far drive, but worth it!  We live in the East End but will  be back.

For the full extent of the menu, consider trying a dish from each of the four distinct groupings. The peculiar flavor and texture combinations ensure that each dish is something that you've likely never eaten in Pittsburgh. For our meal, the ingredients (a few unknown to our palates) simply worked. And high five to the staff for attentive and enthusiastic service. Not sure I'm sold on the lounge setting we dined in though. Lastly, I'm curious to see if SM can sustain long enough to establish some measure of longevity -- there's just not much in or around Braddock to make a night of it.",

The ganache was perfect with bittersweet and sour lime but the tonka bean was almost over-the-top unusual and amazing. I can't remember better desserts anywhere.

The final course was baked Alaska, again, ruined by too much kirschwasser and ice cream so hard it couldn't be cut with the spoon. The service was very good and they offered us a second dessert of a citrus tart that was better than the poorly executed baked Alaska. I appreciated that the alcohol pairing included wine and spirits.

I called a few days a head and made a reservation, which was seamless. The staff on the phone was really nice and made a note of my nut allergy and that it was my birthday. We got there at 7, and were greeted by a lovely Black woman who was polite and really friendly. We were seated quickly which was nice. The atmosphere is really nice. J and I really liked the designs, colors, industrial look, and look of the bar. We actually spent time admiring the table as this is something we would have in our own home. They definitely paid attention to details which was great. Their name on the pens to sign checks, the holder for the napkins and utensils, a lot of little things made the restaurant nice. Our server was Dan with the Cool glasses, who was really great. Very knowledgeable and funny, very warm personality. I was able to try a wine to see if I liked it which was nice. Ultimately I settled on a glass of Riesling and J had a coke. I ordered the beet starter with smoked yogurt, frisee, and yuzu. This was banging. The flavors melded so well together and the yogurt was delicious. For our entrees J ordered the beef with polenta, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and bearnaise sauce. J thought his food was good, but \"not $35 good\". I had the tuna (well done), which came with heirloom rice, miso, lemongrass, and XO. My tuna was done perfectly! The meal was tasty overall. For dessert, J had the chocolate cake with coffee and buttermilk (minus the chestnut butter), and I had the creme brulee with lychee bubble tea, and honey. J's chocolate cake was delicious, and I added some to my creme brulee. The honey was described to me as a foam on top, but it was more like bubbles. I guess I was expecting something like the consistency shaving cream foam that tasted like honey, not slightly sweet bubbles. Ultimately I scooped it off b/c I felt it added nothing to the actual dish other than making it look interesting. Plus there was too much \"foam\". There were a few things we were not fond of: while we were there, they played this new age trance like music which was loud and pretty annoying; every time someone entered or exited the building there was a chill that settled in the small dining room; and while the wait staff were kind and knowledgeable, J and I felt that our drinks and food took a while to be brought to us. Longer than it should have for such a small space with about 6 wait staff working. Our bill came to around $120 which J was happy with. Overall, it was a nice dinner and the food was pretty tasty.",

    "text": "Happy we made the drive to check out Superior Motors! Chris and I first heard about this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain's \"Parts Unknown\" when they featured Pittsburgh. We both have never heard about and have been curious ever since. When restaurant week approached, we decided this would be the perfect place to try- and we are glad that we did!   As all the other reviewers said, the atmosphere is pretty cool at Superior Motors. It's in Braddock which doesn't have a lot going on, and then all of a sudden there is a steel mill & a super trendy restaurant across the street. It's full of exposed brick and a very industrial feel. Chris made reservations a few days in advance but we still had to wait when we arrived. When I asked if we could wait at the bar, the hostess told me that there is no standing room at the bar but we could order a drink in the waiting area. We only ended up waiting about 15 minutes before we seated in the smaller area of the restaurant. I wish we were seated on the other side- there seemed to be more going on over there.   They only had 2 options for their restaurant week- a meat or vegetarian option. Before ordering, I started with a glass of wine & Chris got a beer and we also got the fried squid- delicious! We both ended up ordering the meat option off the menu. To start, we were served ocean tartar with trout. It came with seaweed to wrap the trout it- this was just OK- it's not something I would really ever order again. The next dish was a short rib (36 hours!!!) that was served with polenta, Brussels sprouts, and mushrooms. There was also a bearnaise sauce that was outstanding. The 36 hour short rib was the standout of our whole experience here! It was truly amazing. The last course was the sage cavetlli with butternut squash. This was pretty good & very heavy- I am glad we only got a small portion! Last, we HAD to end the night with a desert so we chose the chocolate desert that was a chocolate cake with espresso in the middle & ice cream. SO GOOD!!   Last but not least, the service was... meh. For as much money as we spent here (even on restaurant week!) we both wished for a little bit of a better experience. From other reviews, it seems like they were satisfied with their service- so I don't think this is a deal breaker. Overall- it's worth checking out for a unique dining experience. Be prepared to spend a little more $$ than expected!",

You would have to order  first second and third and remain hungry. And I am ok with small portions but that was  ridiculous. Wine was overpriced. It is shame because the location is sitting across the street from a historic Pittsburgh steel mill in a part of town that can use an economic revival. To top things off they brought an appetizer with a long hair in it. The waiter still charged us for it. Not good!",

    "text": "My husband and I had reservations Friday night at 8:15. We arrived a couple minutes early only to be told that it would be a few minutes. We didn't mid too much- it's Friday and we figured it'd only be a couple minutes. We waited over 45 minutes & we got one of the low bar tables. They offered those tables to us when we made the reservation and it was a much earlier time, but we had specifically requested not to have the bar table. Even more annoying, when we got seated we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the waitress to even come around. It's 9 o'clock at this point, tables are opening up everywhere. There's absolutely no excuse for that. So we are talking over an hour from arrival to even being seen by a waitress. I don't care who your chef is or what you're serving, that is NOT acceptable.   The worst part was the behavior of the staff. The one lady was doing her best to alleviate the situation, but bless her heart it was not working. She told us the reason for the wait was the traffic from the arts festival in downtown Pittsburgh..... the restaurant is in Braddock..... it's 8:15........rightttt. At least she tried. The guy, who I assume was the front of house manager from his interaction with other staff, was so infuriatingly nonchalant about the situation. At first he offered us drinks while we were waiting, but later when we saw the bill they were included. It would've been a nice gesture to pay for the first round since they clearly messed up the reservations. Worse, he NEVER apologized!!! He just said \"well the table we're going to seat you at is eating dessert now so it shouldn't be too much longer\" in a 'I could care less' tone of voice. Other customers were coming up and joking with us about going to another restaurant in front of the staff that's how bad it got. I will admit when we got the food it was good, but there isn't a prayer that I'd ever go back not after we made reservations and still waited over an hour before we even got served. Hope they can fix their customer service problem!!",

I made reservations about 3 days in advance for 2 people, and I was only able to get bar seating. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar because I was able to see the cooks in action. Our waiter recommended that we order about 5 plates between the two of us. That ended up being the perfect amount of food without overfilling us. Our waiter was also very good at recommending food for us to order. I highly suggest getting the pig face, it's not something I would normally order but I ventured outside my comfort zone and was happily surprised. For our main protein we ordered the chicken and lamb. Since I do not eat a lot of meat I ordered the chicken thinking it be a safe dish I knew I would like.  I ended I'm loving my bf lamb, it was cooked to perfection. I wasn't crazy about the chicken though, it almost seemed undercooked. It was super moist which is good for chicken, but it definitely had very pink parts to it. Our waiter was so nice I didn't want to say anything, I also didn't know if that is just how they cooked it there and if I was being picky. All in all it's a great restaurant, but it is very pricey for a Pittsburgh restaurant.",

    "text": "OK- my previous review is below- and I gave the place three- however I went back, and it was HUGELY improved.  Again - the service is still stellar, and with some menu tweaks, I was much happier...  I wish I could do 2.5 stars, but I can't- so I decided to be generous...today.  Just like every reviewer so far, I was super excited to try SM due to the hype and the fact that I usually love every other Sousa Place (RIP Salt) - sadly, it just doesn't live up to it.  I'll note: these are smaller portions and the staff recommends ordering 2-3 dishes/person: we got 2 entrees, 3 apps and a bottle of wine. Our ticket was $225....  First the positives: Our server was very good and incredibly knowledgeable with the wine list.   Front of House service was very good as well.  As far as food, the \"Beef\" was a hanger steak the night we were there and that was delicious.   The Bads:  There is no nice way to say this- the location is dismal, and its a bit of a drive to get to Braddock from most places in Pittsburgh, and frankly the food just isn't worth it.  We had the Chicken wrapped in cabbage (which tasted like...chicken. unflavored); the rice cakes (which tasted vaguely like a chef Boy-R-Dee meal); the Salmon (decent- not amazing) and the Foie Gras (no. just no.).  I know they are changing the menu frequently, so maybe things will get better; but again, its a long drive out there for food to just be \"meh\" and for the price tag attached.",

    "text": "I will admit, knowing the story behind Superior Motors, I was already a fan before I stepped foot inside the building.  But since this is a review of my actual experience, I'll let the yelpers do a little history review on their own time:)  The ambiance is awesome: industrial + edgy with a staff that is warm and friendly.  Despite our reservation, we ended up having to wait for about 20 minutes before being seated, which honestly was not a problem, as my friend and I just checked out the decor etc.  The hostess was lovely and offered to order cocktails for us at the bar and bring them back to us in the entryway while we waited, because the bar area has a \"no standing\" policy.  We decided to wait on our drinks, because standing in the doorway just felt a little bit awkward...but since the bar was full we were out of luck to grab a seat this time around.  The space is divided into a main dining room with bar, and then off to the left is a second dining room that offers a slightly quieter atmosphere, but the same outstanding service even though we are slightly tucked away.    Anthony was our waiter, and from the moment he approached our table we knew he was good!  He guided us through the wine and cocktail menus, as well as the food menu and gave us a little history on his work in the restaurant industry and his love of chef Kevin's newest endeavor.  I felt like I'd known him for years!  He was great!  Uber positive energy, not too pushy, and very knowledgeable on all of the menu items (which are unique as only Kevin Sousa can do!)  I went into this meal expecting \"different\" menu options, but also preparing to leave wanting a snack, as that was my typical experience at his former restaurant.  I could not have been more wrong!  My friend and I each ordered an appetizer, an entree, and dessert, and by the time I left, I was borderline uncomfortably full.  That halibut was HUGE!  Flaky, cooked to perfection, with flavors that tasted clean and fresh.  The rice cake appetizer was really creative and flavorful as well (see photo) but could have easily served as my entree, or at least is a good app to share.  (Don't be fooled though...I ate every last bite).  I finished off with the smoked chocolate dessert, which reminded me of a flan in texture, a really really nice smoky chocolate mousse flavor, but I have to say, the morel mushroom on top didn't do it for me.  I wanted to love it...different idea, eclectic combo as only Chef Sousa would do, but I couldn't like it.  So I sadly tucked it aside and devoured the rest of the dessert.  Now my friend had ordered the pound cake and let me just say there was nothing not to love about that!!  I could have licked the bowl.  I look forward to returning and trying more of his dishes, because I am certain one dish is as good or better than the next!  I will try to get there earlier next time in hopes of scoring a bar seat and trying out some of those bar snacks...it's a solid 4 star experience, and I hope everyone checks out this great Braddock establishment.",

I wouldn't make the trip again because it didn't impress me enough. The portions were very small. I had the venison and only half of the plate had food on it and the other half was empty. It seemed like a very strange preparation. The taste was quite good but it is a bare bones restaurant. The bread is $3 per slice. It seems strange to be charged for a slice of bread. We are in the USA, not Italy. Italy charges for bread & water. Just charge each customer $2-3 more per entree and give us bread. It took 15 minutes for us to receive our cocktails. The servers were very courteous and efficient. But I think they need to hire another bartender to help out, especially on a Saturday night.",

Our daughter was in town from her home in San Francisco and as usual we try to find a place to impress her with the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, as she usually does with us when we visit her.  We started with 2 appetizers, the octopus and the chicken liver, both excellent and enough to share among the 3 of us. We each selected a different entree and shared with one another. Each entree was cooked to perfection, tasted fantastic, and the presentation was exceptional. When it came to dessert we chose to pick just one and split it as we were happy with the portions of the other dishes. The smoked banana ice cream dessert was outstanding.  At the end of the meal out daughter commented that this experience could possibly be better than any San Francisco restaurant she had visited.  I thought that the price was quite reasonable with the exception of the glasses of wine that we ordered. I'm possibly wrong about this but as far as i can discern the wine price by the glass was about the same as the retail price of a bottle of the same wine (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars). We will be back.",

    "text": "4.5 rounded up for phenomenal service (Sarah is a gem and SM would do well to keep her on!). We were seated in the dreaded low table area, but we found the bench-style seating nicely intimate. I agree with another reviewer that if you're dining in a non-date duo, you should alert the host that you don't want this style seating.   We went with two starters, two entrees, and one dessert, and it was a bit more food than we needed. For starters, we got the tuna tartare and the foie gras. The foie was a really interesting combination of flavors--the cherry, beet, nuts, and foie all sang together. However, we both thought that it was easy to get fatigued from the flavors. It would make an absolutely incredible \"spoon\" (like a two-bite dish), but a bowl of it was a bit much. The tartare was well-seasoned, featuring the flavors of the whole dish rather than just highlighting fresh fish. The dish is also available with beef instead of tuna.  For the entrees, we went for the lamb and the pork. The lamb was the most tender I've ever eaten, and the lentils and veg underneath were delicious. The pork was a duet--tenderloin and pork belly. The pork belly was tender and crisp, and topped with a really cool take on \"pork floss.\" Our server explained that it was made from a Japanese technique of repeatedly dehydrating and grinding the pork...whatever it was, it was insanely flavorful. We were less enamored with the overall composition of the dish--the veg were a bit bitter and seemed to clash with the rest of the flavors.  For dessert, we went with the pavlova. We make pavlova a lot at home, and this was just as it should be--crisp on the outside, marshmallow on the inside. The yuzu curd was perfectly proportioned, and it was a lovely end to the meal.  Sarah told us that the menu will be changing in another few weeks, so we will likely trek out to Braddock again to sample Kevin Sousa's latest creations...the man is not boring! Unfortunately, the amazing, convivial space lacks happy hour specials, but those may be in the works down the line.  NB: Parking is to the right of the restaurant as you're facing it; the lot to the left belongs to an adjacent building.",

    "text": "Things started off a bit rocky when we arrived for our reservation and had to wait, even though there were several empty tables. Not such a huge deal, I used the restroom which was an odd experience as there was no mirror, a weird faucet/hand dryer combination and nowhere to hang a purse or sweater in the stall. The decor of the space was industrial and edgy, but made it very loud (a problem that persisted all evening).  Nonetheless, when we finally sat down and perused, we settled on ordering the rice cakes, the soup and grilled sardines (a special off the menu starter) as appetizers. Order the rice cakes if you can tolerate weird textures, I oddly found the things that looked like elongated gnocchi tasty despite their odd texture and having no idea what they were. The soup was ok, nothing to write home about, and the sardines which were served whole and had to be filleted by us at the table were pretty good.  For dinner, my table ordered the Halibut, Grouper, Chicken and Rigatoni. All three meats were impeccably cooked. There were two purees with the Halibut and I'll be honest, the eggplant puree was just plain gross. The rigatoni was delicious and the sweetbreads with it were seasoned well and are good if eating the thymus of an animal is your speed.   For dessert, we ordered the infamous chocolate mushroom dessert which I enjoyed immensely (I don't like mushrooms and still enjoyed this) and the sorbet, which was also quite tasty and very refreshing.  After our nearly 3 hours service (WAY TOO LONG for a Wednesday) I can say that I would go back, but in no rush. It's evident that each dish is creative and thought out well and everything is on the plate for a reason which I appreciate. Portions were nicely sized. However, the textures of many dishes were unusual. Several things were very good but there were a few that were kind of yucky. If I could, this would be a 3.5 stars..3 too harsh and 4 too generous.

    "text": "Four and a half but reluctant to go to five just yet.  First impressions - no sign that I could see from the street led to a somewhat hesitant \"poking the head in the door\" moment. We had reservations  but were originally seated on the bar side at a knee-high table. The gentleman who was seating us could see the uuhhhhh look on my face (I did not relish the thought of having a full meal at a coffee table) and he juggled a few things around to seat us at a regular table on the other side. The space is gorgeous yet casual and manages to feel welcoming and industrial at the same time.  Server really friendly and welcoming without being too chatty - perfect. Asked if our drive was long to get there (it was about a half an hour because it was a Sunday evening, no way would I attempt it from the South Hills during rush hour) and was, in general, really knowledgeable about the menu and clearly enthusiastic about the place, which gives a nice vibe that sets the whole evening up well.  Menu dropped, not a ton of offerings but what was there looked delicious. We chose two cocktails to start, the Vermouth and the Gin - both of them well-balanced and extremely tasty. Wine list interesting and reasonable and the bottle we got was very good.  The food was superb. We started with the scallops and the octopus then had the beef and the pork for mains. The flavors were incredible and complex and so THOUGHTFUL, for lack of a better word. I have seen people complaining about the prices and the portions here on Yelp - two things I think about that: 1) the prices are not cheap but you can see that there is an incredible amount of work going into these plates and the food cost itself has to be high because the quality is fantastic, and 2) this is a cheffy place with cheffy food and that is either your thing or it is not your thing. If you want a fantastic 16 ounce steak, go to Capital Grille. You will not be disappointed. But if you want to eat something that delights and surprises you, go to Superior Motors and enjoy flavors that you might never have considered working so well together. There are times when I want a giant steak and there are times when I want to eat something I know I could never pull off at home - SM is a place where you get to say WOW, that's amazing.  The desserts - 50% - the smoked chocolate was amazing - the pound cake was dry and the brittle had an off-flavor like something had gone a bit rancid. I think the dryness would have been helped by the ice cream scoop on top that appeared to be on another portion I see here pictured on Yelp - I don't know if mine was missing or they just changed the presentation.  Downside - it is LOUD. Way loud. We were about halfway through our meal when our server, without us asking, mentioned that they were aware the sound was an issue and that they'd ordered baffles to put up to dull it but were awaiting someone to put them up. My husband had actually just said that he wasn't certain he wanted to return, given the fact that we were pretty much shouting at each other the entire evening, but knowing they recognize it and are working to mitigate it is a good thing. Another downside is, of course, the location - it's way off the beaten path (particularly if you are not already an east-ender) and with on-street parking only it could get difficult, particularly in poor weather.   Things I hope for SM - first, that they put up those darned baffles! Haha! Second, that they retain what appears to be an amazing staff - our server was first rate and the other server in our section was so enthusiastic you couldn't help but catch her good mood. Third, that they are able to make a go of it in a tough location - Dave Racicot's first crack at Notion in Aspinwall comes to mind - no one wanted to go all the way out there even though the food was amazing - but I think Kevin Sousa has mitigated some of those issues by making the vibe at SM casual and fun - it fits the way people want to dine out today, I think - there were folks wearing shorts, and the place felt bright and airy.   Finally, Kevin Sousa, if you brought back the Salt Burger, I wouldn't cry. Just saying. :)",

    "text": "Outstanding, Yet Understated! I didn't know what to expect when I booked the reservation, but I was so impressed I had to write! The food has an Asian flair, but isn't oppressively so, the atmosphere is casual (the chairs are about as uncomfortable as you could imagine, but the restaurant itself feels ruggedly urban so I guess that's part of the motif), and the service--way better than I expected. Caroline took great care of us. She explained each dish with such enthusiasm that it was difficult to choose our meals! Every recommendation was on-point... I recommend the Skate, the Lamb and the Sourdough Poundcake. Yum!",

    "text": "Very fun and interesting place to dine. This restaurant was formerly one of the first indoor Chevrolet dealerships. The exposed brick walls and huge wall of windows give it a hip contemporary vibe. Love that it sits across the street from the steel mill. So much history. The menu is a bit confusing though. We had to ask the waitress what everything was. The portions are also very small. The wine and chocolate dessert were my favorite. Delicious. Service was great. Fun experience.",

The service was so-so - I felt like we were being rushed to get out of there and no one was very friendly or warm.  The food was just ok - I'm not a big fan of not having a clue what I'm eating.  Overall nothing about this restaurant justified the expensive price.",

    "text": "Really wanted to give a good review for this resturant as the story, chef and location make for a great concept. Food was very unique and my server was AMAZING. She had so much energy and knowledge of the menu it made the whole experience that much better. We were really enjoying our time and food at superior motors until... My significant other was told that he had a phone call at the front desk of the restaurant by whom I think was the manager? He looked like it was an urgent matter and the fact that we were enjoying our time so much that we weren't on our cell phones for even a second I assumed something terrible had happened to a family member or an emergency... Come to find out my significant other was being taken to the closed off back hallway of the restaurant with the manager and one of their table runners claiming that we had called him an (excuse my language) A**H***????!?!?? We were compleletly baffled and confused by this accusation because no one at our table had any reason to say such a thing nor would any of us ever say such a thing... We were a table of adults. What a ridiculous manager to do such a thing to a paying customer! You don't take people in your restaurant to create a conflict with your staff especially when they have no idea what you are even talking about?! What a TERRIBLE experience. We will most certainly NEVER go back and will NEVER forget such a horrible and uncomfortable situation. That manager needs to be fired for what he did.",

I have found that many new businesses in Pittsburgh use the original owner/business name. Unsmoke is the name of an art gallery that is next door to Superior Motors, and another great surprise. Go check it out !",

    "text": "Positives: I would eat here again. Great ambiance and servers. Very knowledgeable assistance with wine selections and love the thing they're doing with 2 related glasses to compare & contrast. Duck was excellent. Concerns: 1) lamb had reportedly been in sousvide for 24 hours; it needed another 12- it was a bit more on chewy side than  tender side (did love beets and black lentils with it). 2) the generous order of beef carpaccio, which was fabulous, came with 1 piece of lavash. My dining companion wanted another piece. Answer: \"no\" - really?! \"The chef makes exactly one piece for each serving, there are no extras\". That is just crazy; the answer to a request like this should be \"of course just a minute.\" 3) maybe we misunderstood the server, but the kohlrabi side dish was described as leafy greens. My impression was thus that it was primarily that perhaps with some of them stem as well. When it came out it was all stem, not a green insight.  4) Also, as others have reported they wouldn't put our appetizer selections in until we were ready to order everything. That was odd & disappointing.   So overall it was a creative menu and nice evening. But we were irritated several times.",

    "text": "Finally got here tonight and was not disappointed.  We had an early reservation and were able to park in the small lot next door. There is plenty of street parking available as well.    The interior is cool.  Exposed brick, high ceilings, clean lines, open kitchen. Nice bar.  We did not find it to be overly noisy as others have mentioned, and the music playlist was great and loud enough to notice it but not intrusive.  Very cool vibe to the whole place, from the decor to the staff.  Front of the house were great - friendly, warm and welcoming. Our server Caroline was excellent.   We ordered drinks from their cocktail list that were good.  I got the \"Rye\"...Wild Turkey, Blackberry and chocolate mint.  We were told that the entree portions were \"not overwhelming\" and that a starter was recommended, which we expected after reading reviews here.  I ordered the chilled tomato soup which was refreshing and very good, with a definite spicy kick.    Our entrees were the beef, lamb and pork.  I ordered the pork and it was perfect. And those potatoes....I can't even.  SO delicious. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I tasted both the beef and the lamb that my company ordered.  They were both melt in your mouth and delicious. All three meats were cooked to perfection.  The accompaniments were thoughtful and interesting. The plating is visually appealing. And we thought the portions were good. For a man with a big appetite, maybe not, but with a starter and dessert, maybe.   We finished by sharing the smoked chocolate and sourdough pound cake desserts. I will say neither of these were the highlights of our experience, but were good.  I couldn't get into the mushroom and the chocolate. I don't feel the mushroom really added anything except for a shock factor, if you will. The chocolate itself was delicious though. I'm not sure what the gel-like top layer was and felt it could be excluded.   A couple of things to change/improve in my opinion.  I ordered coffee with dessert. $5. It was not good coffee. It's also served in a cup without a handle so you're wrapping your hand around the cup itself...the cup gets HOT. Really hot. Like too hot to hold with steaming hot coffee in it.  Ouch.  They also have two window seating areas that are more like lounging areas...would be fine for drinks but would be awkward to eat at.  Think eating off of your coffee table while sitting on your couch.  Regular tables there would be an improvement.   My bottom line - overall excellent. Sublime entrees. Cool atmosphere. Adventurous dining all around. I'll be back. Well done, Mr. Sousa.  Well done, indeed.",
