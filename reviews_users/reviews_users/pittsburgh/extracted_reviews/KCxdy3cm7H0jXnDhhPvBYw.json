Of course, these trucks typically cater to the college students that enjoy large portions of food for a cheap price, and generally care a little less about quality.  However, there are no complaints about the curry here- and being a graduate student myself, I'm not as picky when I'm getting food on the go and out of a truck and paying $5 for it.  I'll continue to stop by here for lunch. As with all of the trucks, plug their number in and call ahead so you can pick your food up as soon as you get there.",

Since I work in Oakland and couldn't find anyone else particularly interested in trying Indian food, I poked around on the net a little bit and discovered this would be a good place to try, especially based on other user reviews, affordability, and the convenient location. I was not disappointed in the least. My first experience (today) was the lamb vindaloo...I bought a small order for $4.50, and ordered with a spiciness level of 5, on a scale of one to ten. Although I do like spicy foods, they do not always agree with me so I will probably opt for a 3 or 4 on the spicy scale next time, even though the 5 was very \"medium\" for your typical heat enthusiast. The portion was more than enough to satisfy my appetite, the combination of flavors was absolutely delicious and unique, and I am now eager to try other meals from this truck!",

According to my senior colleague (who has been at Pitt for over 20 years), this is the best food truck at University of Pittsburgh.   The food is certainly very good and inexpensive.  It's highly recommended for a quick eat near campus.    The portions are large, and you will likely have some food left over.  You can also specify spiciness.   The biryani (chicken, vegetable, shrimp, or lamb) is $4.00 for small and $5.00 for large.  I usually get the chicken biryani, which is cooked with basmati rice, coconut sauce, nuts, and herbs.     The Mango Lassi is good for only $1.50  I think they make the food while you wait.  Call ahead if you want to avoid having to wait out in the cold or the lines.",

The chicken was tender, the sauce pleasantly spicy, and the rice steamed to perfection.  Their small size is pretty generous -- no hunger pangs this round!  And $4.50 for a generously sized small?  No hunger pangs for my wallet, either.  The only consistent downside is the wait.

I ordered the chicken biryani (spice level 1) and my boyfriend got the matar paneer (spice level 3), both small size. They didn't have mango lassi.  I wasn't very impressed by the food. The rice in the chicken biryani was very very red, and the dish didn't have very much flavor aside from the coconut. The matar paneer was a little sweet for my taste.

For a dollar extra you can get a large and have some leftovers.  My favorite has always been the mango chicken curry made by Rita (the cart closest to fifth ave).  You can choose your spiciness on a scale of 1-10.  Definitely the best quick meal for $5 in Oakland.",

He offered to cook me food and leave it in front of the truck for me since I was only available to pick it up after it closed. Unfortunately, some asshole picked it up. But, when I texted jay letting him know what happened he offered to drive back to his truck and cook the food for me. WHO IS THAT NICE THESE DAYS?",

Honestly much better than any of the dishes I had  at Prince of India near by, and for $5.50 you get a large portion, actually had plenty of shrimp and spicy enough.(I asked for 9/10 so probably for 9 I did want it to be spicier)  The place has enough options, including vegetarian and shrimp options.  If I had to complain, the rice looked a little weird, and I don't really like the curry served all over the rice, but again for a food truck its understandable. Also it did take time.  Overall I will definitely go there again, and pretty regularly at that too.",

    "text": "If you know me you know I've been to a lot of restaurants and food trucks. So when I say this is the best Curry I've had in North America, and the best food truck I've ever eaten from, you know I'm either on acid, or dead right. Or more likely, both.  When I see this food truck, I start doing \"India on Cartwheels\" in my mind. And I let out a few \"India on Squeals.\" I brought my friend Remington here, thinking it was \"India On Steele's.\" And if it were referring to my guy friend from Hyderabad who is currently dating my girl friend from Cardiff, it'd be \"India on Wales.\" Ahem.  What to get: Large Chicken Tikka Masala (spice level 1-10) for $5.50. Why: It's the best curry in North America, and I've had at least 57% of them. You're lying: Yes, I'm horizontal in bed right now because I'm full to the brim of IoW curry. So they how are you going to get to the gym today: You're going to have to curry me out.  Seriously, if you only eat 1 thing in Pittsburgh, let it be this. They open from around 11 to 6 each day (shorter hours when school is out, sometimes), parked on Bigelow about 2 blocks north of the Cathedral Of Learning. There's a new one over by Carnegie Mellon too, haven't been yet.  I've sent and taken many people here now, and the *majority* think it is one of the best curries they've ever had. Including people who have lived in and visited England and/or India. So I'm not crazy. I get requests to drive it all the way back to Buffalo most times I'm here.  The prices are ridiculously low. It's silly. I mean, they're basically giving these amazing curries away. The Samosa Chaat is good, the Mango Lassi not so good, but it's the curries that win the world universe galaxy curry contest. Chicken Tikka Masala is *the* one. It tastes a lot like the curries over in England (British Indian is a cuisine all unto itself, invented by Indian immigrants, and perhaps the most delicious genre of food you can get in the UK... and we all do). It would actually be one of the best ones in London, Birmingham, Manchester, or even Bradford. Except that it's in Pittsburgh.  Don't leave it out of the fridge for too long, or it'll be \"India on Congeals.\" And be grateful it's served over rice and not \"India on Oatmeal.\" If you eat so much of it that you get super tall, I'll call you \"India on Shaquille.\" And if you want to turn me on while eating it, try \"India on High Heels.\"  The people of Pitt just don't know how lucky they are to have this truck here. I drive 4 hours from Buffalo just to have it, on a bi-monthly basis. Not that I'm bi, but I would be, if that was the only way to scarf down this curry regularly.  However, one caveat is that not everyone will like it. If you're used to \"Indian Indian\" over British Indian, or if you are used to the Americanized crap (sorry), then this might not be your cup of tea. It's a matter of taste. If it's not your cup of tea, we can't be friends anymore. (Joke) (Sort of). Some of the negative reviews here are actually clearly from people who were expecting Americanized crap, and \"don't get it.\" It's their loss, really.  Another caveat, and my only complaint, is that while they're lovely people, in some of their online responses... I'd advise them to be a little more \"kissy-assy\", one might say. I sent a friend here, and her experience was not great. I wish the responses to her review had been more gentle, less confrontational. An argumentative response to a negative review is so much more off-putting to potential customers than the review itself. If they ever remove those responses and start being suck-ups ;) then I'll remove this paragraph. I just want them to be loved by all the way I love them, for the *incredible* food.  Service: amazing. The owner is a wonderful guy, and has even stayed open late for me on several occasions, I'd call from Ohip and tell him I'd be 20 mins later than closing. No problem. Wow!  If you get it on a Sunday, it's \"India on Steelers.\" And if your banana just un-peeled itself, then \"India on Repeel.\" With these prices, it's more like \"India on Great Deals.\" Or \"India on Steals.\" I might make a movie about this truck: \"India on Reels.\" Or it might turn me into one of those shirtless studly Bollywood guys, so my nickname could be \"India on Sex Appeals.\"  And if you eat more than 1 thing in Pitt, you may also want to try the Rib Eye Taco at Las Palmas (on Brookline), and the Gyro from Greek Gourmet or Gali's, as well as the steak sandwich at Gaucho, and the Old Bay - Wet wings at Bob's Big Shot. But if it's just 1 thing... let it be this Chicken Tikka Masala. Believe it.  Anyway I've been rambling too long, I feel like I've given you the whole \"India on Spiel.\"  And if it were referring to how most Indians imagine themselves hooking up with Jessica Biel (or any one of her sisters), then it'd be \"India on Biels.\"  Whereas if it were about how emotional I get when I eat this spectacular, incomparable Chicken Tikka Masala, it'd be named \"India on All-The-Feels.\"",

Steaming paneer in warm curry and fresh warm chapathis.. what more can one want! They have some combo offers for larger appetites and you can pick from roti, naan and rice to go with your curries. This food truck is no frills.. has limited options but guarantees a full happy tummy! Definitely recommended.. over most other Indian restaurants in the area for sure!",

    "text": "I hit this truck for lunch earlier this afternoon.  After glancing over the reviews, I called ahead to place my order.  I thought 10 min. would be sufficient, but the guy on the phone told me it would take 20.  So, I gave them 15 min. before heading down to pick up my order.  Based on others' recommendations, I ordered a small chicken tikka masala.  Given that the curry I'd ordered from the truck next door had been unbearably spicy for my taste at my normal spice level of 4, I decided to play it safe and order my dish with a spice level of 3.  I also ordered a mango lassi to accompany it, which I typically order with Indian dishes.  Both items cost $6 together, which is a bargain, even in Oakland.  Both the presentation and quality of the food at this truck were comparable to that of the truck next door.  The dish consisted mostly of rice and curry, with a few large chunks of chicken on top.  The chicken varied in quality, with some chunks consisting of questionable quality dark meat, and one chunk consisting of white meat.  The curry had a decent flavor and consistency, but was rather bland in terms of heat, which was a surprise after receiving super-spicy curry from the truck next door.  As for the mango lassi, it was similar to the one I received from the truck next door in its thin and rather watery consistency.  Although the food from this truck isn't something I'd go out of my way for, it's a convenient lunchtime option, esp. for college students and people who work at Pitt or Presby Hospital.  In addition to taking phone orders, this truck is on Tapingo.  Regardless of how you order, just be sure to allow enough time for them to make it, given that the food is MTO.",

I always had leftovers, something a broke college student can appreciate.  I pretty much stuck with the lamb vindaloo or chicken tikka masala all three summers I attended classes in the area. They served it up with basmati rice and I'd order a mango lassi when it was available.  Services was fast and efficient, so that was a plus when we only had limited time between morning and afternoon sessions. The only downside was that they often cooked food in the same pans, making my \"mild\" meal a little spicier than anticipated if someone with a higher tolerance for heat had ordered ahead of me.
