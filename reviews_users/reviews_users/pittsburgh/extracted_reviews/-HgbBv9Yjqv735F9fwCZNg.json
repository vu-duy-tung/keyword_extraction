    "text": "Normally, when I'm looking for a burger or in my case a veggie burger or portobello mushroom cap I'll hit up BRGR or Burgatory. Sometime though if at the waterfront I'll stop at Red Robin, mainly for the freckled lemon aid.   On a recent visit I decided to try their veggie burger, I ordered it with lettuce, onion and pickles. I had a hard time deciding if this was a Morning Star Farms offering or house made. If it was a frozen patty, shame on them. True burger joints need to show the vegans and vegetarians that Red Robin wants their business and should make an in house patty. The waiter could not answer my question regarding to my inquiring if their meatless burger was house made or frozen. It wasn't bad though.   In my pre- vegan days I loved the monster burger and endless fries.   For a chain Red Robin isn't bad, I still frequent the indie places just for the fact they're local owners and they have a better product.",

    "text": "Unlimited fries is a phrase that should make you start asking questions.  Typically when a restaurant offers any food item as \"never ending\" you should probably use better judgement and steer clear of it.  Welp, I didn't, thus I failed.  Red Robin is a chain place that claims to have amazing burgers and infinite fries.  The fries are almost soggy steak fries that don't pair well with the burgers.  They tasted as if they've been sitting under a warming lamp and I didn't ask for a fill up.  The burgers were okay, but neither of ours were cooked the way we wanted.  I asked for Medium it was medium well.  My wife asked for well and it was medium well.  I bet the cook just cooks everything to medium well.  Good for him.....  I really don't know what else to say.  Might be a nice gimmicky place if you have kids, but really not worth it at all.",

The burger I got this time, bacon cheeseburger on bun, plus pickles was not as great as one of their specialty burgers. I wasn't feeling adventurous, and for a burger place, I thought a  bacon cheeseburger would be a good place for them to shine. Also, they have a great sense of their customers because any burger can be wrapped in lettuce for low carb or gluten free fans.  Their milkshakes are priced well, I think it was 3.99 and that's great for Pittsburgh.  The bathroom was messy for early on a  Saturday night though.  Finally, they added little computer screens for games you play while you wait for food, but it is also how you pay. We had a problem with our screen, and the waitress helped us, but here's how she did it. She saw our screen had another table's check so she walked over to them, switched screens and gave us the right screen, WITHOUT saying a word to the other table. Shouldn't you explain why you're switching screens, especially if they're playing games and keeping score?   I'll be back because of past visits' success and great location, free parking.",

Staff members are friendly, the quality of the food is good, and the restaurant is family and large-group friendly. Regarding their burgers, they have a good variety lined up, but the burgers themselves aren't as filling as they seem. Thankfully, they offer unlimited fries to offset this. Non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails are good, too. (The chili I had at this location was on the salty side though.) Overall, I don't think you can go wrong eating at a Red Robin.",

The servers are friendly--although if they are busy, some of them can be slow. (Yes, we mean you, B.) However, if you ever have anything wrong, ask to see a manager, and they will make it right.  Back patio is GORGEOUS. Sitting right on the Mon.  All RRs have some nice dietary options, i.e., You can substitute a Morningstar burger or a Boca burger (neither are GF) for a beef burger. You can get a GF bun or wrap your sandwich in lettuce. I really like the latter option. You can substitute several things for the fries (since they're unlimited, we usually only have one fry order per table and share) for free and a few more things for a small up-charge. Check the menu for deets.  WARNING: The Waterfront gets very busy on the weekends during dinner hours so don't expect to just waltz in there and get a table.",

This goes to show that memories as a child can be skewed somewhat. The interior decor is an over-the-top tchotchky reminiscent of a restaurant one might find at a theme park, i.e. Disney World.  On the meal for this visit:  Clam chowder Prime Rib Sandwich French Onion Soup Chicken Pesto Pasta  I am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal.   I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer. Stouffers makes a better chicken pesto pasta at a much lower price. There are just too many other better restaurants in the area to consider returning.",

Server was pleasant but not good - incorrect drinks, never brought requested condiments, waited extended amounts of time for drinks, etc.  Food was worse - we ordered our burgers \"Medium\" and both received burgers that oozed blood when cut in half. Asked for replacements and waited 25 minutes and once new food arrived found the burger patties to be burnt on the outside and cooked thru to cardboard consistency on the inside. French fires were also a mix of cooked ok and slightly undercooked with a few that were still cold inside and barely thawed.  Manager came to table and said he would take one meal off the check and said he was told we wanted \"Well Done\" burgers. We informed him that we wanted Medium burgers which shouldn't be bloody but did not want burnt, flavorless charred burgers and undercooked fries.  With Purgatory, Rock Bottom right across the street and Five Guys nearby, we can't think of any reason to come back to this location.",

Honestly, that was a sign. That was a 5 minute sign to leave that we just ignored. Upon coming back she was rather disdainful. She proceded to seat us in the bar area though one of the members in our party was obviously under 21. We requested another seat, and though the resteraunt was not very crowded she sat us at a small table towards the outer aisle underneath a large light. When we went to order our drinks (The best thing about this meal) the waitress placed our silverware on the table. It appeared to have water stains and bits of muck on it, so we requested new kind. To this she responded \"Well they all kinda look like that...Sooooo. I'll try to find you the cleanest ones.\" That's not exactly an excuse. At this point i was seriously questioning the cleanlinest of this resteraunt. Despite that, i went on to order. We started out with 2 flavorless apps (These zuchini sticks and mini pretzels... I do not recommended.) Then we went on to order our burgers. I've had much better, I'm not sure why people rave about this place. After paying for our check suddenly the waitress ran back to inform us that we had recieved the wrong check. She handed us a much higher one then proceded to hover in the area until we payed. Overall, i regret not going somewhere else. I could have had a better lunch at Mcdonalds",

I do give you big props on the now endless root beer float.  But my burger was kind of blah.  I ordered the Royal Red Robin and thought it'll be great.  I've had it before, and this time I was so underwhelmed I could have stopped on my way home at a fast food joint and been more satisfied.  The egg reminded me of a plastic one you see in a kids toy set.  I'm sure if I were to have dropped it, it would have bounce.  The bacon was undercooked and so chewy that I pulled it off the burger and discarded it.  Even the tomato on the burger was making me want to gag.  I remember when the place first opened and I was one of their first customers.  It was pretty amazing and dazzling to be inside, but now I feel like this place has turned into Chuck E Cheese for adults...it's lost its luster.",

My carnivorous craving would surely be fulfilled!  I longed for a perfectly chard burger with melted cheese and a crunchy dill.  When the waitress approached our table with a smile on her face and a tray full of good ol' Americana, she was surely unaware of what was lurking under one of the buns.  She handed over the orders and we prepped our meals to our liking.  As my mother opened her burger to apply a smidge of mayo, she was greeted by three small short and curly hairs melted into her cheese : (  I notified the manager of our findings and he was less than professional.  He said he would have to inspect the burger for himself before approving a replacement.  I pointed them out and there was no if's,and's or but's about it - there they were...looking right back at us...He jokingly patted me on the shoulder (like I was a six year old who just struck out at tee ball) and said he would take care of it.  He walked away without apologizing.  A few minutes later, he returned and apologized for his joking approach but the damage had already been done...images of short and curly hairs came in and out of my thoughts as I ate my cheeseburger in irritation and disgust.  He came back with the replacement burger...a sad looking replacement burger...with two pieces of un-melted cheese sitting on top of the meat patty.  Of course it was still edible, but the way the manager spoke, carried himself and handled the situation - HE is the reason that my family and I will never return.",

    "text": "While the Waterfront is a bit out of my way, since it has the theater that's closest to a number of friends, I'm often in the area; my friends are also major Red Robin fans, so I've found myself eating dinner here multiple times before our movie.  To be honest, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Red Robin. It's certainly not my favorite place to eat, particularly during my casual dieting days. Not only are the burgers oversized and/or glazed in some sort of dressing or sauce, all of their appetizers are fried (except for the hummus plate). In short, nothing is waistline friendly unless you're \"that person\" who asks for tons of modifications in their order. I honestly don't think this chain has any interest in developing a lighter option menu, despite these menus' popularity at other restaurants. The only low-calorie item I know of is their skinny margarita, which really doesn't make much of a difference in my calorie intake once the rest of a meal is added in. So that's a big drawback for me.  Still, high calorie content or not, I'm a fan of a good burger, and Red Robin can make a reasonably good burger in my experience. Even when I've just shared a meal or nibbled on an appetizer (yes, the same appetizers I complained about earlier - like I said, it's a love-hate relationship) I've been satisfied with the taste and quality of the food given that the place is a chain restaurant.   I've especially been impressed with the servers, who really take the time to check on the table whenever I'm there and to keep us posted on the state of our food in the kitchen (which is very appreciated during the dinner rush, a time of day when any customer can feel forgotten and aggravated).  I guess I have to accept what Red Robin for what it is: delicious with a strong dash of dieter's frustration. I'm sure I'll be here again, and, as always, will end up giving in and eating one of their delicious burgers, even if the things are just too much food for little old me. Like I said: love-hate relationship.",

    "text": "I had not eaten at Red Robin for a year. Their quality of food seemed to go downhill. This past Sunday my oldest son and I decided to give it a try.  The first thing we noticed was that the entrance had been redone and had more seating. I also noticed that their tag line is \"Burgers and Brew\" which is a good since Craft beers are what people are looking for these days.  We were seated in the bar area. It also had been remodeled. I loved the huge lighting fixture made from beer bottles.  I ordered a Cobb Salad with no tomatoes. It was supposed to come with Garlic Toast. The salad was good but the piece of chicken was small. It looked like a lunch portion not a dinner portion. The 2 pieces of Garlic Toast were the size of bread you use for Brushetta.  That was disappointing.  My son ordered a Royal Burger with fries. He enjoyed his burger and asked for a refill of fries.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Their food is better and I will probably eat there again but with all of the choices there are it doesn't get the rank of a Favorite.",

I like that there are lots of different options, however I always end up getting the royal or banzai. I'm not sure that the burgers are exactly worth the $10+ but I've never been disappointed with the taste of the food. One complaint I have about my last visit was the burger I got had bacon listed as a topping. Usually when you see this you'd think you'd at least get 2 or 3 pieces, however my burger only had one tiny piece of bacon on it and barely any lettuce, but I didn't complain because I was hungry and it still tasted great.   I'd also like to say service is hit or miss here. Sometimes it's really great, other times it takes a really long time for servers to return to refill your drink or bring your bill or what have you. I also find it really weird how there always seems to be a ten minute wait for a seat even when the majority of tables are empty. I'm guessing they are understaffed.  I'll keep coming back because I love the burgers!",

While not nearly my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh, it's quick and easy and the food is generally dependable.   Some go-to staples for me are the Whiskey River bbq chicken wrap, the turkey burger, and the classic burger with cheddar. I don't go for any of the goopy sauces here, but there are several to choose from. The steak fries are always hot and tasty, and they are all-you-can-eat. Sometimes you just need all-you-can-eat fries!  I really enjoy the flavored iced teas they offer as well. You can get sugar free or regular raspberry, peach, or pomegranata added to your black iced tea (Gold Peak). It's a really yummy option. I also enjoy the freckled lemonade with strawberries. Yum!

We went last week with our toddler and the food was good as usual, but we had standout excellent service. Our server was so incredibly friendly and went out of his way to make our experience a good one, I was very impressed.   It's definitely a good place for families; they have a decent kid's menu with both healthy (apple slices, oranges, salad, grilled chicken) and indulgent (corn dog, pizza, fries) choices, and they hand out crayons and a coloring sheet, so that's a plus in my book. And I do love me some freckled lemonade!  Are the burgers as good as, say, Burgatory? Hell no. But if you get a gift card or have family (like I do) that are sometimes scared of non-chain restaurants, I can definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Sooooooooooo....  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but my family seems to love them. Being my brother's birthday and not wanting to go against the general consensus I met my family down at this Red Robin for lunch on Saturday. The hostess was generally unhelpful due to half my party already being seared and her just sort of shrugging and not leading us back to the table. Luckily my brother is hard to miss so I was able to find him easily.   We started off with a few apps: onion ring tower and pretzels with beer cheese. We would have also had the hummus but unfortunately they were out. The onion rings were standard--crunchy and onion-y. Breading didn't totally fall off which is always nice. The pretzels were piping hot with a crispy exterior and a soft center with not too much salt. That is how I prefer my pretzels so I was pleased. The cheese dipping sauce was very strong and overpowering. I'd skip it, but my family seemed to really like it.   My main burger was something with Bleu cheese, onion straws and some unfortunate tasting orange sauce. The sweet potato fries made up for it, but I found the onion bun + Bleu cheese to be a not so good combo. My sister had a similar complaint about her Southern Comfort burger, saying that there were entirely too many flavors competing and none of them complimented each other.   Someone else had the 4 cheese melt and honestly I'm bummed out that I didn't get it. It was a grilled cheese with the perfect amount of cheese, perfect crispness, and excellent bread. 10/10 would get it again.   For dessert we tried the croissant donuts. They were warm and yummy, but not worth $8.99 per order. I'd rather go to Dunkin.   Though the place was decently full for 2pm, our server was prompt, friendly, and quick with refills. I liked being able to pay at the table with cards instead of having to have them run back and forth processing everything. This place is not my first choice for chain restaurants but I'd choose it over Applebee's any day of the week.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this chain, I really did... but after disappointing visits to the Mt Lebanon location (soggy fries in greasy drippy paper cones), to Settlers Ridge where we were the first table seated but it still took almost 40 minutes to get our burgers and even then they missed the most important ingredient of my Ghost Pepper Style Burger (then delivered it in a portion cup on the side) to my most recent visit to this Waterworks/Homestead one- I GIVE UP...!    First off- it was a Tuesday evening and it wasn't crowded.  We were seated pretty quickly and offered menu's by the hostess.  The waitress came by a second or 2 later and asked us if we were ready to order.  WHAT?  We didn't even get drinks yet.  We told her we were going to look over the menu but could she please get us 2 tall Coors Light drafts.  Seeing the bar from our table I noticed that there wasn't a bartender behind it.  There wasn't any customers seated there so I guess that's 'protocol'.  Anyway, our waitress goes away with our drink order and goes behind the waitress station to put our order in.  She comes back about 10 minutes later ( after my wife & I each alternately used the washroom & washed up) and asks if we're ready to order yet.  I ask her if they're still doing the Tavern Tuesday Deal and she says \"No, they stopped that weeks ago\" which I know is a lie because I get the e-mails every Tuesday Morning.  I asked her about our drinks and she says, \"I have no idea what's taking your drinks so long...\" which I reply, \"It's probably because you don't have a bartender over there...\"  She shakes her head and walks away.  Still no movement over to the bar so I get up & walk over there myself.  No one seems to notice me and just as I am prepared to grab 2 glasses off the bartop to fill them myself- a Bartender appears...!  She asks if she can help me and I tell her I'm at a table 'over there' and \"...I've been waiting for beers for over 15 minutes with an empty bar...\"  She pours my beers and I return to the table.  The waitress comes by about 5 minutes later, sees the beers, doesn't say a word, and keeps walking.  Our burgers come out about 10 minutes later, accompanied by their 'bottomless fries' which amount to 9 fries on my wife's plate (in a silly cone) and 11 on mine.  WTH...?  I immediately requested a second batch.  At least at the Settlers Ridge location- they brought out the fries when they were ready and didn't leave them sit there to get cold & soggy while the burgers cooked.    This experience was another Red Robin let-down... You just can't get it right... 3 visits... 3 Strikes... You're out.  I'm sorry that it has to be like this as I LOVE hamburgers...  Btw. Our visit was on Nov 10 if anyone cares...",

I swapped the bottomless side salad for what I thought would be bottomless fries, which I only got like 10 of, and you guessed it, were not bottomless.The waitress never asked if I wanted more fries, but every other time I was at a Red Robin's location they always asked if I wanted more. Also, every other time I got the pub mac and cheese, there was more of it, and it tasted much better. This cost me $7.99, yet a double cheeseburger (with unlimited fries) was cheaper, and I assume it would fill me up. As a matter of fact, this was the first time in my life I left a restaurant feeling just as hungry as when I entered, however, my wallet was empty like my stomach.",

The caesar salad (either the \"Mighty\" size or the smaller side salad) was pretty lame: two times too much dressing.  The server's attitude seemed to be that quantity takes priority over quality (they kept asking my friend if he wanted refills of french fries (I tried one, found it disappointingly soggy, and had no more).  I see nothing to recommend at Red Robin.",

    "text": "Back in January, I went to Red Robin at the Waterfront and had an awful experience. We rarely complain in restaurants and are pretty easy going... but we complained- along with several neighboring tables over the course of... oh say... 2 hours that we were there.   The only reason I am leaving this review is that I complained to RR through their website and got NO response after the first response saying someone will get back to me. And I have prompted a response every month since.   At our visit there was a fight in the kitchen with SCREAMING and CURSING. Loud enough we could clearly hear it at our table from across the room. We waited a while for everything. At one point, we asked for silverware and were told they didn't have any. And this was BEFORE the dinner rush and well after lunch (around 6). The restaurant was practically empty.  My sd was served a salad on a plate that had clearly not gone through a dishwasher.   When we complained to the manager, she blamed it all on our waitress- who had done a very good job under the circumstances. It was clearly not a waitress issue and we were appalled by the manager's blame game... which is why we complained. The manager did comp us some food and brought sd dessert, but I will not return- not here or any Red Robin since corporate doesn't seem to care!",

Everyone around us that were already there were being taken care of, and we were ignored. Not even a look our way. So we bounced.

    "text": "Honestly not sure why people are so addicted to this chain. I've avoided this chain since my visit awhile ago, and with good reason.  To start off, we went around 9pm, to find ourselves waiting for a table. We were told 15 minutes and it took 30, which is fine, since sometimes things come up.  We got the onion rings, which were pretty good. Kind of a comfort food, nothing particularly that someone would crave for, but not bad. Took 20 minutes or so to arrive I do believe.   I ordered the garden burger with a side of endless fruit. We had several endless fries as well.  Now, where to begin. Service was s-l-o-w. The garden burger was cold, dry, and the patty was beyond consumption, literally. It had massive bites taken into it, and was hard as a rock.   My endless fruit was fruit preserves, likely because nothing there is fresh, and was never refilled.  In fact, none of the fries were refilled without taking several minutes to wave down the servers, which were not particularly attentive.   The sweet potato fries were terrible. Not only were they soggy and cold, but we sent them back 5 times to have the same disappointment. We told them this to only have them say \"they get cold fast\".   Honestly, go spend your money somewhere else.",

I took a seat at the bar after looking for a stool that didn't have the previous customer's dirty dishes and napkins.  There wasn't any so I sat in front of a dirty dish and glass for over five minutes before the area in front of me was bussed and I was offered a menu and a beer.    It took an unusually long time for my Pig Out Tavern Burger to arrive and when it did, the bun was all soggy. The burger tasted okay but \"okay\" is about as good as it gets. Definitely not worth $8.45.  I wasn't in the mood for fries tonight so I substituted broccoli and that was a bit over done and slightly mushy.   The best I can say for Red Robin at the Waterfront is that it sports a full bar but the craft beers here are limited. I was there for about 45 minutes and during that whole time, the bar wasn't bussed once and I dined next to a used empty glass.   This place is either severely understaffed or miss managed (or both). With all the competition here at the Waterfront I don't see how Red Robin stays in business.",

I had Mom and Dad with me today, out for a late valentines date.   We were greeting only after my dad said hello to the Hostess. She was too busy blowing up balloons to say hello.   Our server was quickly at our table, and slow to bring the wrong drinks. My dads a diabetic, and she brought him sweetened peach tea, after he asked multiple times if it was unsweetened. Whatever. She eventually got it right.   She takes our order from memory. (She also forgot to introduce herself, so she's fortunate that her name isn't smeared throughout this review.) I HATE when servers do that. You're not gonna remember everything. Our food comes out and dads fries are on moms plate, mom doesn't have her spicy sauce on the side, and my burger that was supposed to be pink, is well done. There's also only five fries on my plate. So, I placed a reorder.   Ten minutes later, no fries. Dads ready for more, too. She's over at the bar, on her phone. Sorry, I use my phone a lot, but never in front of the people I work with, or does it deter me from doing my job. This girl was Candy Crushing something serious when I walked over to the bar, and asked about the fries. \"Oh, I didn't know you wanted more!\", was her response. Again, whatever.   The manager comes out with the fries in what seems like a millisecond. He tosses them on the table, ignores our empty drinks and goes away with no interaction.   I always wonder why you wait for an eternity here. They're never busy. Their parking lot is basically just overflow for Mitchell's.   I'll say it a third time, as never go back to homestead, whatever.   Happy Eating, Just not here!",

There is a reason why I rarely take the advice of \"acquaintances\" and this is it: they are rarely right. ONLY TRUST YOUR BEST BUDS!  There is one Red Robin in my area in CT and I had no desire to go out of my way to try a chain-y place when we have so many cool local places in CT and southern RI. However, this RR was right down the road from my hotel here in Homestead, PA and I wanted to take advantage of my opportunity to try this place out, finally.   I ordered the Guacamole Bacon on a GF bun, a side of sweet potato fries, crispy, and a Poppin Purple Lemonade.  The lemonade was served in a funky glass. The glass was the only attractive part of this meal. The drink was sweet...nothing special.  The burger was actually good but not for the price...$10.95! (I can't recall if there was an upcharge for the GF bun). This was an average burger that cannot be called gourmet. There was a tiny SCHMEAR of some kind of fake looking guac sauce on the top bun. Bacon was cooked well.   I did ask for crispy sweet potato fries...BIG mistake. Crispy must mean burnt to RR. Inedible. The server did replace the fries, however, they were only a little better...no taste. Rubbery. How do you make a sweet potato fry rubbery in a fryer?  I can see why folks who do not have access to restaurants that serve reliable GF food would enjoy Red Robin burgers. If that is all you have access to, it IS a decent, average burger. But here on the Waterfront in Homestead if you want a great burger on a gluten free bun...go to BURGATORY. My goodness, they are worlds above RR.",

Fries were cold every time, so clearly she let them sit there till she decided she wanted to bring them over. She was rude made me wait over 5 minutes for lids and a bag, I got tired of waiting so I just stood up and asked someone else mind you I had already paid so I was ready to go! When I paid on that tablet my rewards number wasn't going threw and she gave me attitude Bc of that. I also asked for an apple juice to go which came with my son's kids meal which includes \"bottomless\" beverages and the manager stopped me halfway out the door with a new check saying I didn't pay for that apple juice, his name was \"Ron\", he was just as horrible as his server, he was full off it. I told him he'd see my review on yelp and he said he didn't care. He really was trying to argue with me over a 2.06$ apple juice. Pathetic. So hi Ron ,hope your day got better treat your customers with some respect next time. Guess customers aren't right anymore at Red Robin. Pathetic service. Pathetic \"manager\".

Until: she began arguing(?) with an older waitress in the back of the dining room. I'm not sure if it was arguing or just a very fast paced conversation, but it was so loud that I could hardly hear the person I was dining with.

We had about a 15 minute wait when we got there and then we were seated in the almost empty bar area, there were about 20 tables and only 2 had customers at them so I really don't understand why there was a wait at all but whatever. After another 10 minuets the waitress finally came and took our drink order, she seemed a little rushed but she brought the drinks back quickly and took our order. Our food took a while coming out but when it finally did everything was right and the burgers were really good, the fries were pretty soggy and there were seriously maybe 10 on the plate. I don't understand what the point of calling it bottomless fries if they barely give you any and then act like you're asking for a kidney when you need more. The waitress didn't come back and check on us until we were both done eating and since we were both still kinda hungry we both asked for more fries and she brought us back one basket with maybe 10 more fries in it for us to share, thanks. The burgers and my Oreo shake were both really good but the bad service and less than generous portions of cold fries made the trip not worth it at all. I'll probably go to Red Robin again, just not this one.",

    "text": "I'm writing this as a review to my future self...  Hi Future Self,  This is Past Self. Did you just drive into the Red Robin parking lot? Then turn around and find somewhere else for your meal. \"It's convenient,\" you might say. Or \"everywhere else has a longer wait.\" Don't let this discourage you, you CAN have a way better experience somewhere else.  You will undoubtedly walk in and wait at least a few minutes, only to be brought to a table that is either unclean, missing utensils, or something else. The wait staff will arrive only to provide poor service or forget about you all together and you will need to go in search of a team member or manager to help you in another part of the restaurant.  When you finally receive your food you will be underwhelmed and left empty, sad that you ultimately did decide to have your meal here. \"It's really not that great,\" \"I don't know why we came here,\" you'll say to yourself.  Future Self--I implore you, go somewhere else and get lured in by the bottomless fries.  Best Regards, Past Self",

Ordering from an iPad -esque screen  does not provide the initial relationship with the server. I had to raise my hand for a drink. I'm not an obnoxious customer, I promise! It's just that I need a drink! Isn't that server 101? There were so many people standing around tonight (not getting me a drink). The fries are never ending but the servers don't ask if you want more. This is due to the iPad-esque ordering screen. You'd think with this assistant that they would be able to free up some time. But honestly, who wants frozen steak fries?",

After getting our drink, Kerri, the waitress, disappeared. So our food showed up 20 minutes later, my son ordered a plain cheeseburger with bottomless fries, which was OK. However, my grilled chicken Cobb salad was absolutely disgusting.  I have no idea what the chicken was made of but there's no way this stuff was chicken! It was hard and inedible, but still white like grilled chicken. I couldn't bite into it or chew it. I asked to see the manager about it , he showed up 15 minutes later and tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong with it. He insisted on bringing me another salad, however, at that point, I didn't want it..  He finally agreed to just take that horrible mess away and take it off my check. But the pain doesn't stop there!  I ended up paying  $15 for a plain cheeseburger  and fries for my 12 year old! Never again! I've always like Red Robin, but this experience, has definitely cured me. Red Robin you SUCK!!! I will eat at McDonald's before I eat here again. If I could give them a 1/2 star or better yet, NO STAR at all, I would.",

She immediately got our drinks and got all of our drinks and food orders 100% right. This can be a challenge for a large crowd, but Cassidy was so professional and cheerful the entire time while we were all there.  Cassidy also kept all the refills on all of are drinks and fries without anybody asking.  Thank you so much Cassidy!!!  Also kudos goes out to the cooks in the kitchen. All of our meals were excellent in taste, temperature and excellent timing.  Not one problem at all.",

    "text": "This chain has quite the assortment of burgers and sandwiches. I signed up for their birthday club and I rarely come here outside of my birthday month when I receive a free burger. Their \"bottomless fries\" make for quite the challenge and it's fun to see just how many servings you can get through.  The only problem is that I've always had an issue with the servers coming back in a timely manner, so I rarely get my fill of fries before I reach the limits of my patience.   They're making an effort to modernize their restaurant, so many functions such as ordering drinks, ordering appetizers, and paying for the tab can be done from a tablet posted at the table. This feels very impersonal at times and I would prefer to stick to the old-fashioned way of doing things but I can appreciate the attempt.   With the many options here, I've been able to try something different each time and I've always been satisfied. Their drinks seems overpriced in relation to their food pricing, but I assume they have to make their money somehow.",

One of my pet peeves is when they bring our food without giving you time to eat your appetizer or salad. This practice irritates me to the point that I ask if I should hold my order back so we have time to enjoy our app/salad...the food came 2 onion rings in. So I'd suggest holding back your food order if you are getting an app. The haystack burger was tasty and done correctly my bun was stale and hard which was surprising considering burgers are what they do here. The fries were good and their ranch was very good as well. With so many other dining options in the area and based on the underwhelming greeting, the unnecessary wait along with the dried out burger bun I probably won't go out of my way to stop back again soon.",

Their decision to ask pink no pink I get makes it easy. However neither burger should have burned edges. I mean burned. It wasn't very good. They are cooking fries so fast they aren't letting them cook completely. Our fries were mushy, and not good. I would recommend the other Red Robin in south hills village mall. It's much better.",

    "text": "My friend was in from out of town and her daughter was craving burgers - with her love of fries - we decided to head to Red Robin since they have endless fries. Big mistake - we could have gotten better food at McDonalds.  The problems started when we walked in the door.  The hostess asked us to wait while she checked on a table.  While we waited 2 other groups walked in and got seated by other hostess.  Finally one of them asked if we needed a table.  We told them a hostess hadn't returned.  She said \"Yeah she disappears\".  She seated us.  Our table was a mess when we were seated.  My seat had crumbs all over it - as did the table.  No effort was made to clean it off.  We were seated at the tables with the red seats.  Since the bottom of the tables have large round bottoms, the seats do not pull up close to the table.  So the 4 year old with us - was barely at the table.  At one point - she tried to push back and the whole seat went backwards, terrifying her.  Honestly she's lucky she didn't get hurt. Employees watched and walked past - not a single one helped - a couple even laughed!  (We told the manager about this at the end of our visit who said \"well these seats are made for 14 and up\"....then why were we seated there!?!)  My friend ordered her burger medium well.  I ordered mine medium rare.  When we finally got our burgers (Service was incredibly slow for a pretty empty restaurant)  My burger came out - if you can even call it a burger - it was well done.  The burger was smaller/thinner than mcdonalds.  My friends burger - was completely inedible it was burnt to a crisp. Even if you asked for a well done burger - you wouldn't have been able to eat this burger.  We also each had 5 french fries on our plate.  5.  Endless fries and they gave us FIVE.    We sent my friends burger back.  Then - it came back completely plain.  NOTHING on it - she was paying for a Gourmet burger - it didn't even have cheese.    The visit was a disaster.  I do not recommend.  Mcdonalds burgers are better and cheaper - just drive down the road and get McDonalds.",

They also had none of their back beer taps working so the selection was limited. The waiter only had myself and 2 others to take care of but even after a full conversation about salad and how I wanted that brought out first...I'm still waiting on it. My burger and fries were brought out very quickly and the waiter was quick to ask if I'd want more fries since they are bottomless.  The food was decent, nothing great. I can think of better places for a burger in my opinion but they do have a lot of variety here and decent prices. I tried the Fiery Ghost Tavern Burger and it had decent flavor/heat. The burger was very well done and I wasn't given an option on how I'd like it cooked. I'd have preferred it more medium but I digress. Overall, this will get the job done if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and a drink.",

I took a risk from my typical order and got the Burning Love Burger, a spicy jalapeno flavored cheeseburger with chipotle mayo, and was glad I did. The burger had a nice kick with the fried jalapeno slices and pepper jack cheese, but not too overwhelming. Service while sitting at the bar was not as attentive as a sit down table would be; however, we were checked in on enough to get a second round of fries.

I have to agree, but there is one more factor that I consider to call it not a good burger, but an AMAZING BURGER. That factor is the...bun. The bun has herbs that makes the bread taste so much better. Plus, it is neither dry no flaky. The bun is baked to perfection.   Did I mention that they have bottomless fries? You can have as much fries as you want. Woot!  Ladies and gentlemen, come here if you want to satisfy your burger craves. I recommend the guacamole burger and banzai burger.",

    "text": "Oh Red Robin, where do I start?  It's not going to be with the long wait time and long line to get in -- no, I went on a Saturday night and that's to be expected at the Waterfront.    It's not going to be about the bar seating where the tables are crammed so closely together that the guy sitting next to us invited himself into our conversation.  (He was really quite friendly although it was a BIT awkward...)  No, no, no.  I'm going to complain about the poor, slow service, the cold food, and the lack of any type of regret or apology on the part of the restaurant staff.    We found a seat in the bar section of the restaurant and took a seat.  Our waitress took our drink orders promptly and our drinks came fairly quickly.  That's about where anything positive about the experience ended.  We both ordered burgers, nothing fancy, no special orders.  I am aware that it was busy and that this might have slowed things down a bit, but REALLY?  We waited 45 minutes from the time we ordered until our burgers arrived.  Where in the heck does it take 45 minutes to cook a burger and slap it on a bun?  After about 25 minutes, our waitress came by and asked if we needed anything and told us our food would be out soon.  10 minutes later, all of the tables around us (including TWO tables that were seated after we were) had been served and we still had no food.   My friend finally went and asked a manager what the holdup was and was told that he would look into it.  Another 10 minutes went by and he brought our food to our table (finally).  No explanation about why it took so long.  No apology.  By the time our food came, we were short on time and practically inhaled our burgers.  The burgers were cool and tasteless -- now maybe we felt they were tasteless because we had to eat so fast that it was like we couldn't even enjoy them...   You would expect that after waiting 45 minutes for a burger and fries that the least they could do is serve it warm...  We didn't end up paying for the burgers, they took them off our check after we complained a second time.  But no one apologized, seemed sorry in the slightest.  I would much rather have paid for my burger and had it arrive warm and promptly...  So.  Red Robin, even in the face of a free burger, you still stink.  I won't be returning.",

Despite this, we had some decent service and our burgers were pretty good.  After much discussion, we determined that it's not really the burgers that makes Red Robin good, it's the toppings.  Simply said, the meat can't stand alone.  Without being slathered in cheese, jalapenos, barbecue sauce, or whatever, the burgers are nothing more than overcooked hockey pucks.    Would I eat there again?  It's likely I would go with someone who has less discriminating taste buds.  Would I take PIC?  Hell no!",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Red Robin's food. I like their sandwiches and bottomless fries. However, this location needs work in costumer service and management. I've been to this location twice. The first time, I went with someone during the late afternoon/early evening on a weekday. It was not very busy, but it took awhile for someone to take our orders. And then we waited about 15 minutes for our margaritas. We got our food and wanted to order more fries since there were probably only 8 fries on our plates, but our server was nowhere to be found. We later realized that he was both the bartender and the server. Not very practical or efficient. When he finally came to our table and we ordered more, he disappeared for a long while again to make drinks for the people at the bar. There were other servers, so I'm unsure why he was bartending AND waiting tables. Anyway, when he did bring out more fries, there were only 6 fries. Yeah, some \"bottomless\"... We ordered more, and after another round of waiting and waiting, another 6 fries came out. Other Red Robins have not been so stingy with their fries, especially if the server is going to disappear for long periods of time and not check on you.  We went again on a Saturday night, so we expected it to be busy. But to wait 45 minutes for two sandwiches is ridiculous. Also, we didn't have any silverware for my friend to eat his starter salad, and we rarely saw our server, so we had to wait about 10 minutes after the salad arrived to ask her for a fork. And when we later ordered more fries, our server was extremely rude, almost as if we were inconveniencing her. When I asked her for more, she just sighed and walked away. After a few minutes, she came back and said, \"I put the order in but it's going to take five minutes to cook. Are you SURE you still want them?\" It's strange that she didn't have time to check on us for refills on drinks, silverware, or ask how our food was, but she sure made time to stop at our table and suggest that we should cancel our second basket of fries because it needs to be cooked!  I've been to other Red Robin locations and they have been great. But I won't be back to this one.",

Not sure if this is a pro or con, but its very kid-friendly and kid-oriented, IMO  The \"salmon\" burger was good (its actually pieces of salmon filet (not ground salmon patties), and I ordered some teriyaki sauce on the side--it was pretty darn tasty! The Roast Beef au jus Sandwich was pretty good too--loads of meat!",

And they have \"endless\" fries. If you need to watch the calories -- watch out here.  They put mayo or some other sauce on all the burgers.  Probably good for families with kids - if you have the $$$$.",

    "text": "I go there all the time and am addicted to their wings.  The good: - They have the best burgers bar none. -  Their appetizers are really good. I think they have the best wings in the world and you can have a lot of fun with their onion rings and other stuff. - Endless fries - It usually is pretty fast.  - They usually make it up to you if they screw up.  The bad: - Due to their location they usually attract families with kids screaming at the top of their lungs. The parents all find the screaming to be \"cute\" of course and won't dare stop their precious little angels from ruining your dinner. Stay far away from any of the tables that seat 6 people or more. - They used to have problems with running out of french fries and taking forever to make burgers, even though burgers were the only things they made. They have been much better lately though. - No sliders. Why? Who knows. - If you order the short stack of onion rings, you get the smaller end. So, you get maybe 2-3 full size onion rings instead of the 6 you should be getting. - Their television's are not well placed. They either require neck pain to watch or aren't possible to watch at all.",

I'm a vegetarian, and they substitute boca burgers on any of their burgers. The 'shroom burger is awesome! My roommate loves the Whisky River BBQ burger.  We crave it. We're junkies. We constantly talk about how we need to get our next fix, nahhh.",

    "text": "Bottomless Freckled Lemonade! Free refills! Must get every time you go!  The place gets packed on a weekend. Their Royal Red Robin burger is definitely one of my favorite. Burger with fried egg! If you love guacamole, get their Guacamole burger. I love this place because you can basically make your own burgers! You can add guac to your royal red robin or you can add fried egg to your guac burger!  Oh, their fries are awesome! Use the seasoning they provide to add some taste. The fries are bottomless as well!  And they serve you the burger with half of it wrapped already. It's clean and easy to eat (especially if you are one of those that's too lazy to wash your hands).",

    "text": "What I like about Red Robin is that it's consistent. I love the unlimited strawberry lemonade and french fries. They have recently added certain new burgers and it seems they're trying to bring more people in. That's fine and the burger was just average. The beers are typically domestic and there's not a ton of variety. They have lots of frou frou drinks if you like that sort of thing and it's good for kids, including a kid menu and balloons. This location is just ok, but also gets really busy since it's next to the move theatre.",

We were seated quickly and taken care of by the wait staff.  I had the Prime Chophouse Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger on two separate occasions. My food came out hot, fresh, and cooked to my liking. The fries were all newly made.   Because it is a chain, you know going in that you won't be gettin extravagant food, but for a burger & fries kind of meal there are a lot of choices, many of which are good.",

    "text": "Red Robin likes to portray itself as a casual dining family restaurant, but don't be fooled- the food is just as bad for you as any \"Super Size Me\" fast food joint. Disappointingly, there are virtually no healthy meal options at Red Robin, unlike many of its competitors.  Burgers and salads all run around 1000+ Calories by default, NOT COUNTING the \"bottomless fries\" that are included with many meals. You can mitigate the damage, though. Be prepared to ask for no mayo or sauce if you order a burger, and be prepared to ask for the dressing on the side if you order a salad.",
