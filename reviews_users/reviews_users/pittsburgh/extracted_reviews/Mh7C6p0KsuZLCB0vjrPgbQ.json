    "text": "This is a cool little neighborhood bar on Western on the North Side. With a 50s diner decor, this place (as others have said) is much bigger on the inside than I thought it would be. It's a large open area, and I would even argue it's too open and not very intimate. However, this seems to be a nice place for locals to stop in for a drink after a long day at work to chat with others in the neighborhood. Many people at the bar seem to know the bartenders and other patrons well, which can be good or not-so-good when visiting as an outsider. I only had a plate of fries, but the menu seemed pretty impressive and I'd like to go back sometime for a meal. The draft list was decent in addition to a nice bottle selection.",

    "text": "The biggest problem here is the lighting. It's simply too bright and it kills the vibe. When I first walked in, I was struck by the barren/sterile feeling of both the bar and seating area in the back. At one point it inexplicably got even BRIGHTER, as some additional green lights behind the bar came on. At first I thought it was last call or something, but it was only 10:30pm on a Saturday night.  Beer list is solid but not mind-blowing. Taps included a rotating Great Lakes, Dark Horse Crooked Tree, Rogue Dead Guy, Big Hop and SA Chocolate Bock plus Guinness and a few macros. Bottle selection is much larger and a board behind the bar tells you what's newest. Prices are about where they should be but maybe a tad high: two Rogue drafts, a Nugget Nectar bottle, and a bag of chips was $18.  The owners were tending bar on a fairly busy Saturday night, but honestly they had trouble keeping up. When asked which Dark Horse was on tap, Irene didn't know. You could tell both she and Dean were working hard, but it was a struggle. It was a little hard to watch since Dean is so friendly.  It's great to see a revamped place like this in the neighborhood (don't be scared away by the outside), but there are better hang-out spots nearby.",

George stated \"I dont want those kind in my bar, they caused before the fire, and now I want a different kind of customer here\".

    "text": "\"Stand up and take a bow James!\"   \"Go home to your mother Vernon.\"   \"I... am... a writer.\"   These are the quotes of the most re-watchable movie I know, Wonder Boys, and one of my beloved ones.   On a frigid Friday night, staying in The Point downtown area, it took a few drinks and a few mentions to successfully lobby the one person that loves Wonder Boys more than me to go to The Modern Cafe. \"Look, when else would we ever come to Pittsburgh, we're in our Wonder Boys town, and we can sit in the red booth where James Leer, Grady Tripp & Terry Crabtree met their maker in Vernon Hardapple.\" Pulled that card, and off we went, and what happened was in a way straight out of Wonder Boys.   While Vernon didn't wiggle his bum and dent the hood of our cab, the experience had a tilt to it. We both hail from cities where people are always around us -- especially Toronto -- and our night in Pittsburgh was not so. Everywhere we walked streets were empty. Each bar was empty. Especially this one. One bartender. Four at the bar. And holy what speed ball did that bartender and group of friends get into?   The space is huge for such a low key place. Bar up front, TVs, and then in the back is a long booth against the back wall, and we sat in the very seats our Wonder Boys did. Look, it's nerdy maybe, but if you're at all inspired by it, we sat in the corner and talked all night.   The four interactions I had with the bartender were upbeat. Very upbeat. Speedball upbeat. And this isn't to say I wouldn't recommend her to be a bartender for the night.   Looking back on the night we probably shouldn't have gotten into the Ford Taurus of the bartender's friend who drove us back to the hotel, but accordingly to them we didn't have a chance at getting a cab over there at such a late hour. I doubt Modern Cafe would ever set up a car service. With such a strange night, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Vernon Hardapple comes back here to reminisce.   With being an institution in some of our eyes, and offering a pretty odd experience...   Take a bow Modern Cafe!",

    "text": "Thinking of places in the North Side to meet my friend at last night, I remembered the Modern Cafe on Western Avenue. I had a rather negative experience the last time I was here, which was probably at least six months ago, however, last night more than made up for the first time here! My friend and I arrived around 7:30 (just after happy hour ended-boo haha) and took the last two seats at the full bar, closest to the door. They also have a lot of tables beyond the bar, however, none of these were occupied. I never caught the bartender's name, but she was awesome, very friendly and patient, particularly considering my friend and I chose to catch up for quite sometime before ordering any food. They have a good amount of craft beers on draft so I went with the Green Flash Soul Style IPA after the bartender had given me a taster of it. Green flash in general is one of my favorite breweries and this totally hit the spot! My friend went for his usual Yuengling. After scanning the menu, we decided to split the Mediterranean layer dip (Hummus, diced tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumbers and topped with feta cheese. Served with warm pita chips) and the Spartan sandwich (Steak, Gyro meat, Provolone & Feta cheese, onions, tomato slices with our special steak seasoning & dressing topped with tzatziki sauce on a 6\" hoagie). The dip came out first and it was a HUGE portion for $8.99! It was really good and filled with all the good stuff, namely feta and olives-YUM! The pita also was grilled and warm when it was served. The sandwich, which was split for us back in the kitchen (without having to ask which was nice), was ginormous and both of us agreed we would not have been able to go it alone and actually finish it. My half had a lot of sauce on it, which is exactly how I prefer my gyros, and you could taste all the flavoring of the feta too. The meat was slightly dry but when paired with the sauce, it tasted pretty good. Since I live relatively close, I'm always going to keep Modern Cafe in mind when I'm looking for something quick, particularly a good craft beer since the bartender said they rotate frequent;y.",

They have your basic bar food - the fries are nothing to write home about.   This was the bar use in the movie \"Wonder Boys\"  - sadly the bar was ruined in a fire in 2009 -they only a have a few of the art deco pieces left - but they have done a nice job of restoring the place after the fire.    Also - they have trivia nights on Tuesday's at 7:30.",

    "text": "I have never written a bad review of anything. But I'll make an except for this hell-hole.   Played here two years ago as part of the Deutschtown Music Festival. Bartenders and staff looked shocked that we were even there. We started playing at 6:00pm and someone immediately ran over and told us we had to turn down. We turned down and played another song, and again --- we were told we had to turn down even more. We obliged and started to play one more song, and they started approaching us again to turn down. At that point, we just stopped playing and gave up. Why would you sign up to be part of a live music festival and not want music in your bar?   So whatever, we ordered food and drinks and just wanted to move on. I got a fish sandwich and fries - greasy, slimy, barely cooked through. I picked at it and drank my over-priced Yuengling draft. Eventually, we got our tabs and they were all wrong. The servers tried to overcharge us, adding on drinks and food we hadn't even ordered. Thanks guys, sorry we weren't your cup of tea! Thanks for being so accepting and understanding!   The crowd of folks here were miserable broskis and jerks. You couldn't pay me to go back here.",

    "text": "This review is purely based on going in for an hour and getting a couple of drinks.  This neighborhood is really cool. I'm not from Pittsburgh and have never really hung out downtown except for a Pirates game, so my wife and I were looking for a local bar before the Kenny Chesney concert this summer on a Saturday. An old style neighborhood with small town charm in the middle of a city.  There was a mix of locals there and people there for the concert. The bartenders were very friendly and seemed like they had fun with their job. Others in the bar were friendly as well. They ranged from a single loud guy at the end of the bar yelling at the soccer game, a family having dinner, some concert-goers, other couples, etc. It was a good vibe for what we were there to do.  Other families and groups were eating an early dinner toward the back at the tables. They also have outdoor seating so you can people-watch out on the sidewalk.  I appreciate their half-off drafts from 4:30-7:30(??) on some days of the week, which included Saturdays. They have a very wide selection of beer in general, but the draft selection is better than average!  I would definitely go back here for the same purpose before a concert or ball game next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

It's way bigger than I thought it would be. A little lonely feeling for a lunchtime. Out of so many sandwiches it was hard to choose, but I went for the Reuben. I'd say they're a tricky beast to tackle. It was okay. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. I like mine loaded with sauerkraut, and this just had a decent size for someone who likes an even distribution. But not me, load it on! I was a little bummed the bread was a bit soggy. That's the worst, right?  I asked the dude for a suggestion on a side and he said try the coleslaw because he doesn't like mayo. But when it came out, there was no question, it was a mayo based slaw. I love mayo, so that was fine. Not bad again. Just okay.  I think this bar would be my jam if I lived on the North Side. TONS of beer on tap that I'd for sure want to tap into! Maybe I'll treat myself to a happy hour there... Let's be honest, he beer will come a'callin!",

While I was kind of disappointed there weren't any espresso drinks on the menu, they do have hot coffee and liquor, so you can pick your poison depending on the time of day. It was also nice that they had free wifi, so I could work on my computer while I charged up my other devices for directions.   The bread was soft and fresh and my sandwich was garnished with a pickle. I'm pretty sure the shrooms came from a can, but the fact that they had a veggie option at all was pretty cool.

    "text": "Met up with friends at Modern for Happy Hour a couple days ago.   Their happy hour deal is very solid.   My Pittsburgh Cheese Steak was good, and what I wanted for a satisfying dinner, but was also the only thing in the basket.  Also, to be honest, i'd only briefly looked at the full food list before our order was taken, but was hungry and went with the first thing my eyes caught.  For $8.50, I'd like some fries.  You can order \"cheese fries\" separately for an extra $3.50, but that seems a bit much in my opinion.  Honestly, their sandwiches are good--I've asked friends who've been their too--but are a bit too pricey for what you get.  Our friends and us also got the chips & dip though and that was very nice.  Also, Modern seemed very understaffed when we were there, night of 9/12/19, as our server was also the bartender and she had a steady flow of customers.  She only was able to come over about every 15 minutes or so, and generally seemed a bit overwhelmed.  Was everyone else off that night other than her and any kitchen staff?   I'm sure we'll pop back into Modern at some point soon, we live nearby, but it wasn't the best first impression.",

The bartender came over and gave us the drink list and I asked for menus.  My better half went off to use the facilities and I browsed both menus.  Upon his return he looked over the menu and decided that he wanted to go elsewhere.  I was fine with that as there are other places in the neighborhood to go.  The bartender was very friendly and checked on us often.  Because we did not get anything to eat or drink I can not speak of the food or service.  But this place does seem lively.  Indoor and outdoor seating available for when it is nice out.  Fairly big space on the inside.",

A cool little cafe with good comfort food, a good staff, nice decor, nice location, and.....wait for it....Bells Two Hearted Pale Ale.  If you don't know don't worry.  If you do know...rejoice.   We came in out of a rainstorm and the first thing the bartender did before we even asked was get us a towel.  Nice touch.   We then drank, ate, watched college football and had a great time.  Four postal workers came in as did other civic workers. If they like this I was pretty confident that we were getting good food.    Located in a great section of town with decent parking its a gem.  I only wish we had one in Oakland.",

    "text": "I've loved this place since I moved to the North Side 4 years ago. It's such a great bar to stop in and have a drink with friends out of town. It has such a relaxed environment even when it is busy on the weekend. They have happy hour on Friday and Saturdays.   I stopped in for lunch yesterday and wasn't disappointed at all. I ordered the spartan, my fiance got the Pittsburgh cheesesteak and my friend got the Ruben.   The spartan was huge! It has so much meat on it I was stuffed after I finished it. It came with gyro meat, steak, provolone cheese, feta, tzatziki, and onions. Everything was so delicious I would absolutely get it again.   The Ruben was not bad, it didn't have anything on it that \"wowed\" me. A little light on the meat, but still a good sandwich.   We all agreed that the Pittsburgh cheesesteak was one of our favorite sandwiches of the day. Plenty of toppings and great flavors.   My biggest disappointment which is why I cant give 5 stars, is that none of the sandwiches come with a side. Each sandwich is about 8.50-10 bucks. Not too unreasonable for a sandwich in the North Side. If you want fries (or any side) then the price jumps from 8-10 bucks to 13-14. Price goes from reasonable to ehhh not really worth it for some fries.   Overall the experience and environment of Modern Cafe is great! I cant wait to revisit and eat here again. Fries or no fries the sandwiches are delicious.",

The main reason: they're overpriced. I got a very small, meager-looking French dip for a price that was only slightly less than that of another local sandwich shop that charged on slightly more for an even bigger roast beef sandwich with fries. They also advertised that the sandwich came with grilled onions, but the ones on my were raw. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is that they have Leona's ice cream sandwichs and baklava. Otherwise, as far as lunch places in the Northside go, look elsewhere.",

Cute little 50's decor themed bar & restaurant with a very comfortable vibe. The craft beer list changes frequently but, always has something I'm excited to try. Sampling isn't a problem here if you're unsure of your choice.   The sandwiches here are to die for! Their sandwiches have won the Northside Sandwich Competition a few times and for very good reason - they're fantastic. The Spicy Sicilian may be my favorite sandwich ever with a close 2nd their Gyro Melt! They're both indulgent & packed with flavor. You're guaranteed to sit there making 'mmmmmm' sounds!! Hubby feels they were robbed of the sandwich prize the year they entered the Greek Cheesesteak, his personal fave.   We also absolutely adore the owners, Dean & Irene. They work so hard and genuinely enjoy their customers and their business.   We will continue to come in for our beer and delightful sandwiches regularly and enjoy a chat with Dean & Irene! There are also Happy Hours on weekdays. It's fun here!!",

Modern Cafe is a nice stop for drinks.  They offer a large variety of bottled beer and a rotating draft list, along with a stocked bar.  There aren't a ton of beers on tap, maybe 12, but usually they have one or two that I like.    The setup is cool but creates some bottlenecking of people around the bar.  This past weekend when we stopped in I had to fight a crowd to get to the bathroom since that many people were just standing and talking.  This wouldn't be a big deal but there were a bunch of tables further back, past the bar, where they could congregate and be out of the way instead of being a fire hazard.     All in all, not bad place to stop for a drink after a good meal in the North Side.",

Calling it a cafe seems to be pushing it--maybe during the day it would be more appropriate to think of it as one. It seems like a decent local hang out to shoot the breeze and watch a game, as there are plenty of tv screens and a long-ish bar.  The interior is a bit dated (and seemingly not in a deliberate way), but it's not scungy or divey. I just ordered a bottle beverage and no food, so I can't speak to the cocktail or food quality.

If you aren't overwhelmed by their great selection of draft (and bottle) beer - that Dean continually updates - you're missing out. And believe me, if you've only come to drink here? Well my friend, you are REALLY. Missing out!! You're not the kind of Yelper who wants to miss out are you? Then get here!  Ok, the beer selection is top notch. Dean is among the nicest owners you'll ever meet. But the food here is absolutely amazing. Irene works magic in that kitchen. Sure, it's bar food and sandwiches. But saying that does a disservice to what comes out of that kitchen. It's far better than that. In fact, the sandwiches The Modern entered into the annual\"best sandwich on the north side\" competition came in FIRST place the last two years. And maybe the year before that. And they beat some pretty stiff competition. And I can tell you from first hand experience that they deserved the win!   So go ahead. Don't just take my word for it. Try it yourself. Maybe you'll get hooked on the Greek cheesesteak. Or maybe you'll find nirvana in one of the other tempting delights. Have a beer. Order a sandwich. I'll meet you there next time.....",

You walk in, and there's a bar - then you walk past the bar into the little dining area. It was super adorable. It was Sunday around 6 and we were basically the only ones there besides a few at the bar.   Our service was fantastic- the waitress was friendly and helpful when trying to decide what we wanted. We ordered the grape leaves for a small appetizer. I've never had grape leaves, so I have nothing to compare them to- but they were pretty terrible. They were cold, mushy and tasteless. I would never get them again.   My mom ordered the Reuben and my dad ordered a cheese steak. They both agreed they weren't the best sandwiches they have ever had but they were good. I ordered a pepperoni roll and coleslaw. The pepperoni roll was not that great . It wasn't bad, but I've had better ones from get go. The coleslaw was tasteless. I added pepper and some salt and it didn't do anything to help.   The only reason I would come back here is to drink. They had a decent draft list , I ordered southern tier 2xmas which was really tasty. The atmosphere is adorable and the service is great, so I would like to come for a drink sometime when I'm on the north shore. If I do visit again, I won't be eating a meal here :/.",
