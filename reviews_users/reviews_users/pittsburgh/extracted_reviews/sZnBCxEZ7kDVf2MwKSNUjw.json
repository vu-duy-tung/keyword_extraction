They are made with the same ingredients as the arepas, so I prefer the arepas bc they have more flavor. I ordered the Pabellon arepa this time which has shredded beef, plantains, black beans and cheese. This is a great combination!",

As I'm looking at it I decide to jump in. I was blown away by how friendly the staff was and more blown by how good the food is. I ordered a Venezuelan taco with black beans and white cheese. The 'tortilla' was unbelievable. The filling savory. The salsas out of this world fresh. Some of the most authentic Latino food I've had on the east coast. I asked for hot sauce and instead of them plopping down some usual bottle of Tapitio or whatever, they brought homemade stuff blazing with fresh habernaro. I cannot wait to go back and bring some friends. Not sure if it's BYOB but why wouldn't it be? There is no bar so if that's your thing...see my last sentence.",

Wonderful combination of flavors and the taco shells have just the right bite/give. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals, though the burritos may not have played to Pabellon's strengths. Hint: order Venezuelan dishes.  I know this review has a lot of gaps, because I do not have a menu to refer to, but the spirit of the review is to encourage you to stop and try the food.

I came on a Friday night and it was not crowded at all, so I was seated right away. Because Pabellon is so new, they are working on finalizing a menu with empanadas, fresh juice, etc. They did have an arepa menu and a Mexican menu when I went, so I was excited about that! For the appetizer, my fam shared the chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips were warm (I love warm tortilla chips), and the guacamole and salsa tasted great. For my dinner, I got the \"Pabellon\" arepa, which has shredded beef, white cheese, black beans, and sweet plantains. It was delicious. The perfect amount of savory filling plus a hint of sweetness from the plantains- definitely hits the spot. They also put a cute little Venezuela flag in the arepa, which was a cool touch to the arepa's presentation. My sister got a \"Super Burrito\" with shrimp, and believe me, it definitely was a super burrito. The burrito was GIGANTIC!!!! It was probably one of the biggest burritos I have ever seen. Finally, we all had dessert, which was fantastic. I had the flan, which was creamy and sweet.  I would recommend Pabellon if you are in the mood for authentic, fresh, and yummy Mexican/Venezuelan food! ;)",

    "text": "Great first impressions!  I went a few weeks back, before they had the Pabellon sign up, and before it had appeared yet on Yelp.  Even so, I noted how much cleaner and welcoming the place was with the new ownership--Bea's had really declined in both respects over time.  I believe I was interacting with one of the new owners, who was super friendly and seemed excited himself to be starting up the restaurant and exposing us to Venezuelan food.  Speaking of....haven't yet tried the arepas--which weren't yet on the menu at that point--but the tacos were very promising. I ordered three.  Echoing some of the other reviewers, the tacozuela was my clear favorite, and make me excited to try some of the Venezuelan options when I go back.  Also had carnitas and al pastor tacos, and both were solid.    For both of these other two tacos, they included rice and beans on the taco, which seems a carryover from Bea's. I've eaten at many many taquerias in Arizona, California, and Mexico, and Bea's was the first to include rice and beans as a default addition to all tacos.  Seemed like a way to bulk the tacos up, but the actual meat topping tends to get lost, so I'm not a fan of this approach.  That said, all the components on the tacos were fresh and tasty!  Looking forward to my next visit to Pabellon, especially now that the Venezuelan menu is up and running!",

It was a pretty cold day out so the food wasn't piping hot but given the travel time I didn't expect it to be hot or even warm like it would be if I were to dine at the restaurant (nothing that my microwave couldn't fix). I'll just have to stop in next time. And oh yes... there will be a next time!",

The place itself doesn't look like anything special, but who cares? The food is so delicious and way better than many fancy places we've been to. Also, very reasonably priced and the people who worked there (maybe the owners?) were so nice. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

The pork taco was simple and yet one of the most delicious tacos I've ever had.   I prefer simple, slow-roasted lean meats with just enough flavor to complement but not overpower the meat.    This taco delivered exactly that.  And the Tacozuela is something you have just gotta try.    Sweet, juicy plantains atop beef, black beans, guac, and queso fresco.   It's new, so hopefully my first order from Pabellon can help you make the decision to give it a try.",

Crispy cornbread on the outside, black beans, cheese and delicious, moist and nicely seasoned filling inside.

I haven't had the pleasure of Venezuelan food before so I went with the pabellon arepa; it totally hit the spot. Excellent service, affordable, casual, plenty of booths and tables to sit down and eat, and they also do take out and delivery through GrubHub. My only concern is that this location can be awkward to get to because you can't make a left into it from Banksville Rd - you have to do a U Turn by Kuhn's to get there if you aren't headed north, which may be a reason the previous businesses there struggled to survive. We will definitely be back to support this place.",

    "text": "Diamond in the rough. Not that I don't love Banksville- but it's hard to stop and smell the roses on Banksville Road.  Traffic moves quickly- unless it's rush hour of course.  And if you're in the slow moving outbound traffic (during lunch and dinner hours)- you're on the opposite side of the divided road. It can be a little hard to spot- and hard to get to from the opposite side.  Strike while the iron is hot, I always say. Next time you think about driving by- don't.  While Pittsburgh is growing and diversifying- we definitely don't (yet) have a strong foothold in more traditional Latin American flavors. It's okay not to be familiar- but not okay to miss out altogether.  Ask questions about the menu! The staff are all very friendly and courteous.  They work hard and that energy is evident, beyond the flavors themselves. The flavors are fantastic and you can get into something that suits every taste- light flavors, bold flavors, all of it.    I love the arepas- they always hit the spot and I don't feel like I need to take a nap afterwards from eating too much.  If you have your reservations about something totally new, go for one of the more Americanized ones like a Philly cheesesteak arepa.  Im also nuts about tostones (part Puerto Rican on my Mom's side) so it's cool to see and taste something so familiar with subtle differences that are delicious.   If you enjoyed it- be sure to write a review.  We need to get the word out there that this is one not to be missed.",

Served with a sauce that has thousand island hints.  Also got a shredded chicken empanada that was delish!  For entree's, Mexican we got the super burrito, which was truly SUPER. It's huge and packed with ingredients.  We got the shrimp, but may get shredded beef next times.  On the Venezuelan side I got the Pabellon arepa.

I was immediately greeted when I came in the door and was given all the time I need to read the menu. There were so many delicious things. I wanted to try them all. We decided to try the Venezuelan side of the menu since there are almost no authentic Latin American Restaurants in Pittsburgh. So excited to finally have one!  My husband and I really enjoyed it. I got the pabellon and it was really delicious. I loved the Barbacoa or shredded beef and especially the maduros or sweet plantains. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu including the empanadas and the arepas. My husband tried the pabellon criollo and loved it. It was very similar to mine without the flour tortilla and avocado.   If you like Latin American food, you HAVE to try this place. They offer Mexican food too, which looked really good.",

Unfortunately, the only items that I was able to order were the arepas. I was i formed that if i wanted empanadas i would have to wait longer.   I decided to get the Pabellon arepa. When I received it, the beans were spilling out of the arepa and the cornmeal which could've been a little more crispy, was soggy. The flavors were present and the arepa was generously filled. I would come back here again to give this place a second chance however, I prefer cilantro et ajo much more then here for Venezuelan cuisine.",

    "text": "Pabellon has taken over the space formerly known as Bea Taco town. Online ordering is available through Grubhub. During my visit I was shown both the Mexican menu and the Venezuelan menu. The Mexican menu has more to offer but I wanted to try Venezuelan. The Venezuelan menu had no prices affixed to it so I asked the man at the register and was given the prices.  Prices seem very reasonable so I ordered a reina pepiada arepa which consists of chicken breast with various seasonings and an avocado sauce.  As a side I ordered the plantains covered in white cheese. Since I was eating in I was directed to the dining area. The seating area is vast and there is one wall still being redone. They also play music of the country.  I did glance at both menus and saw that they had vegetarian options available as well. I was served my food in a reasonable amount of time. The plantains were spot on good for only $5.00! My arepa came with the Venezuelan flag toothpick on it making it quite cute. The chicken in the arepa seemed cold so I went to inquire about it. I was told that they consider this type of arepa like a salad even though the arepa was warm. I explained to him that this should be noted on the menu since there is also another arepa also served with the interior cold. It was good but reminded me of chicken salad since the chicken was cold.  I decided upon dessert and found out that the only offerings they had for dessert were three milks cake or chorros. I opted for the former and believe me it was rich and so fresh! As I was going to pay I saw a sign in the back that said \"Welcome new concept, coming soon.\" i inquired about that sign and learned that the business plans to get a coffee bar set up at the ordering counter and eventually serve breakfast.   For now they only have one gender neutral restroom-(no place for purses ladies), which is always my pet peeve. The counter man explained to me they are actually working on getting another one per inspector guidelines which is currently in the works. They have no WiFi and cellular reception is pretty bad.  I paid for my lunch and offered suggestions for improvement. Learning they have only one Venezuelan menu which is shared it should have the prices on it and have more of them. Likewise items that are cold should be marked as such. When in doubt I suggest ask before ordering.  It was a descent lunch and next visit will try out their Mexican selections. Located on Banksville Road headed towards town they have their own private lot. If coming from the opposite direction then I would suggest to drive to Kuhn's market and plaza, make a left into it and then pull straight out at the far end and you will be in the right direction.",

My kids immediately commented on the quality in customer service and how friendly and inviting the server was.  The outside is quaint and you could easily miss it driving by, but the i side is clean and well decorated.  The food was INCREDIBLE... full of flavor. It felt like a home-cooked meal. We ordered a chicken empanada, two arepas (reina pepiada & sifrina), two orders of taquenos (the best cheese sticks we've ever had!), a chimichanga, and enchiladas. Everything was a 10/10! Note: the arepas are stuffed and one was more than enough! Om behalf of my whole family, we highly recommend. We will be back!",

I ordered 3 different ones and all were incredible. The empanadas were great too as well as fried plantains and of course rice and beans. Next time I will flip the menu over and try the Mexican food too. My step dad is Mexican so I'll check back with another review after we try the Mexican side and see if as legit as the Venezuelan side. Love it. Oh and the owner is super cool and friendly.  This would be a great place to have cater a party with a bunch of empanadas and arepas with some beans rice and plantains on the side.",

Ask for a side of crema/sour cream.  We took slices of beautiful tres leches cake and flan for later.  Waiter was super friendly and made good recommendations.

I ordered an arepa and my companion, wanting taquitos, ordered golden tacos (which are fried like taquitos.) The tacos came with rice (which was cold so she didn't eat it) and black beans, and some lettuce and cheese on top as a garnish.  The arepa was by itself and small, although it tasted great especially the plantains. The two dishes were very close in price and I assumed it was a dinner plate but no.  I doubt there was much more than 2 ounces of meat in the arepa.",

This place's tacos are overflowing with delicious chorizo.  The choriqueso was wonderful too as was the bacon and yellow cheese empanada.  My only complaint was I ordered my tacos with only beans and rice and they still came loaded with onions and cilantro.  Luckily I was able to pick them off.  Delivery time was reasonable and food arrived still warm.  Overall I definitely recommend this place and will be ordering again!

It's a nice break if you want to try something in between Argentina and Mexico in Pitt. Pabellon takes over from Bea Taco, but maintains the familiar Mexican menu to increase its appeal. The restaurant is run by Venezuelans and features a very extensive arepa selection. The arepas were crunchy on the outside and well proportioned. This is the right way to make an arepa! The Catira and Pabellon were excellent. If you have never tried cheese sticks from Venezuela, try the tequenos. Their vegetarian options are limited, but ok for lunch. Service was slow but friendly. I will be back to try their other Venezuelan staples.",
