I want to leave, but I'm afraid my choices at this point are limited and I can't risk having to start waiting all over again somewhere new.  Hmmm...just heard the waitress tell the guests at the table near mine that the kitchen messed up their order and asked if the wanted to take the food to go.  I also noticed that one guest at that table had his food while the other waited. They were here before me. Did I mention that I'm hungry?  I am starting to wonder if I might die from starvation in an IHOP!  I feel like the biggest idiot for sitting here waiting. Better be some awesome eggs in my future...",

When our orders came, they got my wife's completely wrong and acted snotty when we told them. When my order came,  I asked if I got toast with the meal and the waiter said \"this is not eat and park\" and then walked away.   One of the plates my order came on was dirty but at this point I gave up, paid for my meal and left.   Save yourself some trouble and skip this place, there is a Cracker Barrel nearby :)",

The staff was walking right by us and didn't say a word to us as we were standing there waiting to be seated.  Other people walked in from another side and got seated before us, there was no organization from the host if there was even one.  When we finally got seated they tried to put the two of us at a big table in the middle of the room so we asked for a booth instead and had to wait from them to clean it.  Then they left a dirty coffee pot on our table we had to remove.  The staff was terrible (our waitress however was pretty decent) everyone else acted like they didn't know what was going on and was just walking around.  The place was filthy and the bathrooms were dirty and smelled. Also, you should tell some of the workers to take their piercings out of their face very unprofessional.  Maybe something a little more subtle.  The food wasn't great either it looked like they just threw it on our plate. It still tasted good but the presentation was poor. Not very happy with my experience and that place needs a makeover with the staff and making the place cleaner.",

    "text": "Like others, I should have judged by the empty parking lot and gone to Denny's or Crackle Barrel instead.  This is IHOP right?  International House of PANCAKES????  So I order chocolate chip pancakes.  The menu shows them as filled with luscious chocolate chips.  What I got was two buttermilk pancakes with about a tablespoon of chocolate chips in the center and a dab of whipped cream.  I was sorely disappointed.  My husband ordered a side of biscuits and gravy.  There were four half dollar hard little biscuits on a side dish (like overcooked cheap Pillsbury) will about a tablespoon of gravy per biscuit.  Other restaurants have delicious sausage crumbles in their white gravy that is poured all over the biscuits - but not at IHOP. The waitress was a young gal who really needed some mentoring, but she managed to get our food out in a reasonable time.  As far as cleanliness... the table next to us had at least 10 carafes of old coffee and other assorted items all over it - not sure if they were storing things there or what... Overall, the food is mostly ho-hum, and the pancakes for a pancake house put a shame to the name. I did write to the company to let them know how poorly this location was representing IHOP - and no one ever bothered to contact me.  I don't really want free food, but good customer service would be to call and tell me how they planned to fix the issues and to coax me back. IHOP remains silent - which tells me they really don't care.",

I've been to this one several times, never truly amazed by the service or food but never have been put off by it either.  We went in this past Saturday and before we were ever seated (and we stood there for almost ten minutes, not one person came out of the kitchen or even passed by) my husband decided to hit the rest room, he came back out after a minute or two to announce the soap dispenser not working, so we decided to leave,    If a restaurant doesn't have a working soap dispenser in the bathroom then maybe there might be a few employees not washing their hands after using the bathroom.  So needless to say we left.   Just food for thought (and no, no pun intended).",

    "text": "Its taken me three trips - count 'em - THREE, to come to the conclusion that your satisfaction with the restaurant is totally linked to who is working that particular day. The first time I went, I showed up at 9AM on a Saturday morning, having just moved to Oakdale and hungry for pancakes.  I ended up walking out when the young, blonde, and totally disconnected hostess sat me at a table for six (I was all by myself) when there was a family of five standing in front of me in the lobby who'd been waiting far longer than I had.  I rejected the table, and she told me that there were no other places for me (with six other booths that I could see that were vacant and needed bussed). So I walked, which I rarely do.  Second time, it was late on a Saturday afternoon, before the dinner rush. Perfect service, perfect food.  Couldn't ask for a better experience.  I truly thought they'd redeemed themselves until......  Third trip in. Sunday afternoon, with family. OMG, the service could not have been worse, nor the pancakes colder. Mine wouldn't even melt the butter.   It is interesting to note that no manager was around (or at least not in sight) when I had NO problem, and had perfect food.  At both of the other trips into this place, the management was front and center, and not doing a damn thing to make sure things ran smoothly. In fact, on the first trip, I truly think management was making things worse by not allowing the employees to do their jobs without interrupting.  Third trip..meh. The manager needs to be replaced, and whoever they replace him with needs to know what good food is.  I'll add two things here.  I trained waitreses for a few years for a MAJOR restaurant chain that is in direct competition with IHop, but not in Robinson.  And, I've worked retail.  Retail and training waitresses makes me a pretty darn good observer of the problem at this restaurant - all fixable, but not by the current management.",

The pancakes were FREAKING EPIC! The food was fast, hot and delicious and the service was great. We had an older lady as our waitress and she really took care of us! I don't know how she did it as the place was completely packed. My cup of orange juice never went below half full. I am really anal about that! She even gave us full to go cups of what we were drinking! Needless to say I left her a tip that was bigger than the cost of our meals as her service was that good!   The second time my wife went along as well and it was a totally differant experience. Over 45 minutes to get a table. Service was awful! Our waitress was a young girl in her late teens that just couldn't be bothered. I had to track her down just to ask for a refill and some extra napkins. The food was rushed and didn't taste nearly as good as it did the previous time.   Now I love IHOP and have been to quite a few in different states but I will most likely never go to this location again as it is just too far to drive for crappy food and service!   Insider Tip: A IHOP is currently being built in Squirrel Hill next to Hokkaido Seafood Buffet! It should be opening very soon!",

I won't go there and eat in person since there is always at minimum a 30-45 minute wait for your food, longer than anywhere else in the area. I don't get a two hour lunch break at work, and that's what you need for a few measly pancakes at Ihop.

    "text": "Need to start off by saying that liking IHOP is a deep dark secret that I keep. I know I know it's an \"evil corporate chain\", but damn aren't those some delicious short stacks.   My biggest beef with this place is the hostess stand. No matter what time of day I go, they can NOT get it together.  Why is there a 20 min wait, when there are 8 table open and a huge line of people?  Now, before you get all up in my grill about double seating, I have been a hostess and a server, so I gets it. HOWEVER, on a Sunday at noon, I expect to get sat like crazy, and as a former server I love it! More tables = more cash money in my pocket.  However, these hostesses don't get it, and on top of it they are rude as hell.  Management really needs to step in b/c it's not appropriate for a teenager to be rude to a Senior Citizen.  Show respect. Once you are seated the service isn't bad, it can be slow, especially during that dreaded Sunday after church rush, but it's not terrible.   Food is pretty standard.  Lunch and breakfast.  Like I mentioned above, it's a chain so it's nothing extraordinary, but it's good.  I always get breakfast, but this past weekend I ventured out and got a turkey club sandwich. Not too shabby.  The French fries were seasoned and super yummy.   If you're in Robinson and have a hankering for some breakfast, definitely go, just be prepared for a teenager with an attitude to make you wait an unnecessary mount of time.",

Menus were given and drink orders were taken...nice!  Or so I thought.  My husband asked for a fresh cup of decaf. The waitress said she would brew a fresh supply of decaf.  In record time, a carafe was brought out...but with cold bitter coffee.  Asked again for fresh coffee.  Waitress did not take the full cup of nasty coffee away.  We had to ask for creamer so many times. I got a carafe of regular coffee, but when I put the creamer in, it turned a gray color. \"Old coffee!\"  We had no silverware. We had to ask twice for the silverware so we could eat.  After 45 minutes, my husband's breakfast was cold and eggs were snotty. He was afraid to send it back for fear of what they might do to it. But the  bacon was great!  My side salad came out.  I had asked for soup for my 1 side, but was told there was none...that they would have to cook some and it would take awhile. My meal never came out.  My son's order to go was wrong. My waitress was in the back door of the kitchen and kept peeking her head out, but she rarely came out despite my saying \"Excuse Me\" and moving my arm.  I asked for my meal I ordered.  They said your meal was the side salad.  I asked for the manager. I said I am not paying for a meal I did not receive.  She said she would take care of the bill and personally get my coffee and meal.  Begged for ice water. They finally brought my meal out.  I was starving at this point. My husband finished his cold meal long ago.  Cold mashed potatoes...the rest was ok.  Well we are now leaving...still no coffee...and to top it off, I was handed a bill with only my meal removed but was charged $4.00 for a salad that should have been my 1 side with my dinner.  I handed my waitress my bill, said the manager would take care of the entire check, which she didn't.  I never received my promised cup of coffee.  When I mentioned that, there was no apology...just \"do you want a cup to go?\"  NO, i wanted it with my meal!  As we left, the parking lot was still empty...maybe 3-4 cars.

She let me get the Spinach and Mushroom Omelet, with the fruit, and those Chocolate Chip Pancakes on the side complete with the choco- batter.   The S&M Omelet, which so DID NOT come with whips and chains, was ok I guess. The hollandaise was a little bland. I almost ordered the Bacon Temptation again but wanted to try something different.   The fruit bowl came before anything and was nicely palate-cleansing. This wasn't canned pears and peaches in syrup. Everything tasted as if it had been freshly cut to order. Grapes, orange slices, I forget what else (haw!), this is why I dig fruit salad.   The True highlight was that stack of chocolate malevolence I had so looked forward to for years. I never knew a choco batter pancake was even possible.   I, with Vic Frankenstein acting as my muse, attempted to create one at home once. It got up, ran out of the kitchen, knocked over a neighbor's shed, let out a horrid groan, and died.   I kid my sad-sack culinary skills. But allegories aside, it didn't work out.  Once again, by belief that pancakes are dessert has been emboldened. These were soft, newly-baked, plate-sized, oooey, gooey, chocolate chocolate chip cookes, topped with a heap of whipped cream that nearly slid off the top until I intervened!  3 bites in, and I had achieved a cocophile's Nirvana, saving my late- night meal.   Try the Splashers for something different beverage-wise. Many restaurants are doing this, and I applaud them for it. Splashers are mixed soft drinks. Of the two IHOP offers, I tried the Tropical Island Twist,which is lemonade, lemon-lime soda, and mango syrup. Glug, glug, aaahhh.   Oh, I contacted management about my previous IHOP bop and have a gift certificate on the way. All is forgiven. Maybe I'll use it at the new one in Squirrel Hill.   Unskinny hop just blows me away, unskinny hop hop, all night and day...",

    "text": "This is a somewhat painful review to write because it means finally coming to terms with the loss of a childhood love. I am a breakfast food MONSTER and I had a craving for pancakes a few weeks ago before fueling up for a shopping trip in Robinson.  I should have gone with my first instinct, a local breakfast diner, but I decided we'd come to IHOP because I hadn't been in such a long time and I do enjoy their variety of syrups.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived, and though we were seated right away, it took an inordinate amount of time to get water and our coffee carafe.  I was *thisclose* to suggesting that we bounce and get breakfast at a certain Swedish furniture chain when our harried server finally appeared.  Now, I will say this: the food service industry is grueling work, and our server was doing the best she could.  She was friendly and apologetic for the wait, so I can't fault her.  It just seems like this restaurant is poorly managed. When the food eventually did come, the omlette was decent, but the pancakes....ugh...I couldn't taste them.  Choc full of blueberries and I felt nothing.  No stir of emotion, no tingle of tartness.  At first I thought it was the nasty head cold that I had at the time, foiling attempts to taste food.  But my healthy boyfriend finished my pancakes and he said they tasted bland too.  IHOP, you have ONE job.  And that's to serve baller pancakes.  And you failed.  I wanted to enjoy the experience, but on the whole, it was a flop.  I'm so sorry for both of us.",

Secondly, since we weren't able to use the 20% off coupon I had on my phone, we did get a 10% military discount so all was not lost.  Service was fine, friendly and appropriate. However, this was the longest we have ever, at any IHOP from all over the country, waited for our food.  It was kind of crazy honestly. The main reason we came was because I wanted to try the new French toasted donuts. We tried both the strawberries and cream and apple fritters. Both were good, but not worth an extra $5 each if you added them to a different entree. If you got one of the specials that included them it was a good deal.  Our meals were just as expected excluding the ham on my dish. It was way overdone and dry as a bone.  Sometimes you just need breakfast no matter the time of day, so I'm sure we will be back again.",

I got the 2x2x2 which consisted of two pancakes, two strips of bacon (or sausage) and two eggs. Nothing about my meal really impressed me. It is for sure a little below average to me. My total was around $7 for that meal, which isn't terrible but I would rather spend that money elsewhere for a better value.   My friend ordered french toast, which looked good. in addition, my friend had ordered two sides of hashbrowns. I cannot exaggerate that the hashbrowns did not come out until we were done with our meals. By the time they came my friend had actually forgot about them because it had been so long. mind you, our food didn't even come out that fast, in fact it was a pretty long wait compared to other restaurants. I think our server should have taken the four dollars off of his bill since he didn't even get to enjoy them with his meal. they also had oil literally dripping from them and soaking in a pool of it on the plate.  All and all, I will probably never return unless I'm dragged there against my will. This is just another example of huge corporations providing half ass food and being stingy with their money and discounts.",

That however was not the case.  We waited ten minutes by the door just to be noticed.  After we were seated it took a few more minutes even to have our drink orders taken.  There were three of us in my group, when we got our drinks we ordered at the same time.  Twenty minutes later and nothing showed up.  It wasn't just us, it was every table around us, no one had food.  Another bad thing, everyone that was seated after us got to order before us.  Another fifteen minutes passed and one of the servers finally came out to give some sort of explanation.  Supposedly there were only two servers and one cook working that night.  Well, tell the cook to stay in the kitchen and get behind that griddle.  When our food started to trickle out of the kitchen, nothing showed up together.  My sister ordered turkey bacon and pancakes, my mom ordered the two egg breakfast with toast and I ordered the pick a pancake combo.  The two egg breakfast and turkey bacon showed up.  Then came my pancakes.  Then the toast.  And finally the pancake stack.  Yes, I did say finally.  I never received the rest of my combo.  By the time the server realized this I had finished my pancakes.  She came over and asked if I still wanted them.  I politely said no, I don't want to wait any longer.  The server took my whole meal off the check and gave the rest of what we ordered twenty percent discount.  Oh, yeah, never got a refill either.  There is no fault to the server here, we didn't hold any of this against her and we left her a generous tip after we finished.    The management should be ashamed at how they are running this place.  They are definitely going to lose business.",

Normally I don't write reviews on chain restaurants, but after seeing all the bad reviews on here, I think this place deserved more. We came here on a Saturday afternoon about 1:45ish. Place was pretty dead, not very many people eating here at that time. We were seated right away, attended to right away and served pretty quickly. Was typical food from any IHOP nationwide, nothing special, but definitely no complaints. We were in from out of town for the weekend and this place was close to our hotel. We came back the next morning. Being Sunday morning, the place was packed. There was a wait for a table, but surprisingly, the wait wasn't long. We were seated within 10 minutes, and our server was waiting on us almost immediately. Food was typical of IHOP as usual. Nothing great, but not not bad at all (you're not eating at a 5 star restaurant). I am not writing this review because I feel sorry for these people, I'm writing it to let others know, I was either extremely lucky, or this place has made some phenomenal progress because the service was great and the food was as expected. For a really busy Sunday morning, all the employees were humping their butts waiting on everyone. I would definitely return.",

You'll have plenty of time to watch the employees have a blast hanging out with each other, and not doing their jobs.  The 10 minute wait for coffee is also an ample opportunity for this, just remember to ask for a spoon, because they won't give you one (you're supposed to stir coffee with your finger I guess?).

My last visit there (after a very long night of drinking), I was immediately greated and asked how I was doing. Well, i informed the nice young lady that I had been out late the night before and needed as much grease as I could get. She was very polite and let me know she had my back. She informed my waitress what was going on and she checked up on me quite a bit during my visit.   I don't remember what it was called, but I got four pancakes, potatoes, bacon and eggs. It might have been the fact that I was hungover and starving, but it was  good. It was your typical IHOP breakfast. Not absolutely fantastic, but not nearly as bad as everyone says it is.",

It's annoying and rude that countless servers walked past our table, clearly seeing we didn't even have drinks, yet not one simple acknowledgement. Upon walking out the hostess kindly told us to have a nice day little did she remember she just sat us 10 minutes ago. I gave  a ONE STAR for just her simple kindness.",

    "text": "I try to avoid this IHOP at all cost because of their less than favorable service. My sons birthday was on the 13th so I let him pick his lunch location. He chose IHOP. We waited to be seated for 15 min. I thought wow they must be busy. The restaurant was only half full when we were finally seated. I'd also like to note that while sitting there an elderly couple came out and made the comment to us I Hope you are not in a hurry. I should have heeded their warning. But I digress.  We did not get a waitress for another 15 minutes to even take our drink order. When she did I wanted to put our order in since we had already been there a half hour. Her reply was oh I'm not your waitress.  So it takes another 10 min for our drinks which were a water and a chocolate milk. But our waitress did drink it over. My son ordered cupcake pancakes, I ordered the Mexican style pancakes on the waitresses recommendation.   It took about another 35 minutes to get our food. How my 5 year old was orient this long was a blessing because I certainly lost mine. His pancakes were delicious. His word. My pancakes were not, they were dry and the vanilla sauce might as well not been on there for as little as they used.   To make this review a little shorter we didn't see our waitress again until 15 min after our meal was complete and had to flag another waitress to go find her.   This experience was horrific. Stay away.",

Our waiter, Vick, was outstanding: calm, cool, efficient, and charming.  Our food was delicious: bacon omelette, steak omelette, grilled cheese sandwich, and waffle.  The french fry side dish for $2.99 was small and it was over-salted.",

Today was our last attempt with this place. Someone sat us and we waited 15 minutes and not one person acknowledged us. We overheard the table next to us, looked like about 6 people, voice their disappointment with their service as well. Sounded like half their order came out wrong. So, we decided, let's just leave. As we were walking to our car, we noticed the table next to us was right behind us. Hope they turn this place around sooner rather than later. It's a wonder they're still in business.",

I got the Bananas Foster French Toast meal, I liked the Bananas Foster French Toast and the bacon, but the eggs were scrambled and over cooked which made them hard and dry, the hash browns were ok.  My daughter got the chicken and waffles which you really can't go wrong with and she liked it she couldn't finish it so she took the rest home.  The waitress was very nice and polite and asked if we needed anything throughout our meal which was great.  I noticed that things were clean which was definitely a plus.  All and all the food for me was ok, but the service was good.  So I will probably go back and try something different.",

I was told the food would be ready in 15 minutes, but it actually took 45 minutes. I had to correct my order at least 3 times because something was missing or prepared incorrectly. Instead of apologizing, I was charged even MORE money because they rang up a side order of broccoli wrong the first time. You should pay me for this torture.",
