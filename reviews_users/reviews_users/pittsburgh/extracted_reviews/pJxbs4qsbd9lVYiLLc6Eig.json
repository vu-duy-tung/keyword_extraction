They treat vegetarians right, having a tofu option and the meatless options cost almost a dollar less than their meatfull contemporaries.  Lots of different options (all with silly names) spanning Burritos, Tacos, Quesadillas, Salads and Nachos.  Ingredients seem pretty fresh, everything comes with chips and salsa (5-6 different options).  Can be VERY busy on a weekday lunch but they move people through very quickly.  Outdoor seating on the square is also nice.",

Cons: Guac was too tomatoey Dining room was cold because of the location of doors Constantly hearing \"welcome to Moe's\" Odd names for all of their items  In general, I'm a fan of Moe's, but usually only when I have a coupon as the cost can really add up when you add on the drink, chips, etc.  I like that everything is made fresh and too your liking.  I was disappointed with the flavor of the chicken and found my rice to be fairly dry.  On a second visit, I had tofu as my protein and I thought it was a much better option than the chicken was.  My major complaint is that they try to be cute with the names of their food items so half the time, I forget whay my burrito bowl is actually called by the time I get up to order it.",

I wasn't surprised that there was a huge line after the \"lunch rush\" hour.  Anyways, I ordered a Personal Trainer salad.  As you can see by this picture, the QUALITY of the ingredients, specifically the lettuce, was unacceptable and the salad unable to be eaten.  As a result, I threw the salad away and wasted ~$7.  I am not talking about one or two leaves of lettuce here, the entire portion of lettuce was either black, slimy, past the \"use-by\" date and inedible.  I ordered the salad to-go and ate at my desk for lunch so it wasn't even like I could go back and ask for a new one.",

I know you can see and directly talk to the guys or gals behind the glass as they roll up your one pounder burrito, and my hubby should have said something, but didn't.

On a positive side, Moe's definitely has their lunch process nailed down to an efficient machine.  They pump people quick enough through the line that there's often a bottleneck and a battlefield at the open salsa station and drink stand.  Relative to the food, as many others have referenced, Moe's offers your typical Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. style build-your-own Mexican bar.  Being similarly priced to those options, the quality of Moe's ingredients simply doesn't compare and can best be described as bland at best.  The \"free\" chips with every meal (I hate these type of sales gimmicks) are honestly outgunned by your standard grocery store Tostidos fare.  I haven't tried the queso, so that may act as a saving grace.  With an abundance of great establishments downtown to grab lunch, Moe's just doesn't make a meaningful price/benefit argument.",

    "text": "I hate to be harsh with Moes because I honestly like eating here, but it's just a quick fix when I want Mexican.  Absolutely nothing jumps out at you when you eat at this place.  The food is a bit too expensive for what you get and what you get is nothing special.  It's not necessarily bland but is certainly cheap.  They have a decent variety and good amount of options but none of what I eat here ranks as the best I can get anywhere.  Also, I'm very annoyed by how they organize and name their menu items.  They try to be cute, but it's really just obnoxious and not helpful.  I mean, you tell me, what do you think of when you hear the term \"Joey bag of donuts\"?  Do you think Burrito?  If it was a Burrito would you have any idea what was on it?  Dumb, right?  The people are nice enough, no real complaints.  But they aren't customer service oriented.  When I was at this particular location, one man worked hard to do a lot of things for me while two other people basically puttered around.  I was kind of annoyed by this.  They're fastidious to yell \"WELCOME TO MOES\" and other random unintelligible things at the right times, but getting me through the line and to my seat without annoying me. . . not so much.  This is kind of a theme for them, they sacrifice being a restaurant for being an experience.  The place is clean, but is often a bit cluttered and disorganized.    One other complaint. . . they have TV's but they are always tuned to ESPN no matter what ridiculous thing is on.  There could be a local game on another channel and they'll leave a screen saver on if that was what ESPN was showing.  Dumb.  One compliment. . . they have decent homemade tortilla chips and a salsa bar.  Both are bottomless.  Really cool.  Also, they have one of those new Coke Machines that gives you over 100 options in pop.  All in all, it's like going to Subway.  Sometimes you crave it, sometimes it's just convenient, and sometimes you avoid it like the plague.  If you know what to expect, it delivers exactly that and you won't be disappointed, but if you expect to be blown away. . . find another restaurant.",

The opinions were endless just likes Subways selection!  This selection included, guacamole, sour cream, pickled jalapenos, fresh jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, melted cheese, beans, rice, salsa, and much more!     Additionally, this restaurant had very affordable prices! I was worried that the price would be super big! In fact, each person is under $10!  Also, as soon as I saw the cash register I thought it was a low price!  This is one of the reasons I loved this restaurant.     This restaurant is also a family restaurant! This place is kid appropriate too.  You can bring your kids, wife, or husband. I love this restaurant for this and many reasons!    One con about this restaurant is it is a bit loud!  When I was at Moe's a softball team came in!  Luckly, I was already out of line but that softball team was super loud!  Also, the softball team made the team super loud!

Sure, it has its perks like free chips and salsa, but I've been let down more than once by this particular location. As we entered, we were greeted with the most unenthusiastic \"Welcome to Moe's\". Inside, the restaurant was a mess. Every single table was dirty and there was trash and food spilled all over the floor. Their workstation looked especially disgusting with all the old, dry ingredients and the condiments spilling into each other. If this is how it looks when the restaurant is empty, I can't imagine how bad it must be during busy hours. To top it off, the girl making our burritos was the worst. Completely rude and didn't even ask what type of rice we wanted. I think I'm taking a break from Moe's for a while. If you need me, I'll be next door at Chipotle.",

    "text": "First thing first, this place may not be my ultimate favorite tex-mexy type place, but the people complaining about the wait...in Downtown...at lunch time...well, that's just silly. EVERYWHERE is packed. Even Subway is packed at lunch time and everyone knows that place is garbage. I suggest ordering online; it's easy and eliminates A LOT of the wait. Just be careful because for some weird reason they \"pre-select\" some things when you order online and have to un-select them if you don't want those items.   Now, the food. I got the salad with chicken and a bunch of veggies. It was pretty good. It was no Chipotle, but good. I liked the chicken and the fact that you can get so many different kinds of veggies in your salad. And I will say this, the burritos my friends got looked yummy. They also have things that Chipotle doesn't offer, like queso and a spicy ranch for your salad. Plus, there's a whole salsa bar where you can pick any and all the salsas you want. And one thing that is waaaay better than Chipotle is the chips. I always find Chipotle's to taste stale, but Moe's were crispy and fresh and didn't just taste like oil. I tasted my friend's taco, with ground meat, which screamed taco bell to me, but if that's your thing... Overall it's not my favorite but I really like some of the things that Moe's offers that other places don't. And there's always the bonus that you're paying for a bowl full of listeria or whatever else Chipotle decides to serve up that day. And with the rising prices and diminishing portions at Chipotle, it's nice there's other options out there.",

    "text": "Moe's to me is the place to go when I can't get to Chipotle. That's actually exactly how I ended up eating here last week - the line for Chipotle was just too long to stand in considering some coworkers and I had a work meeting we had to get to an hour or so later.  When we walked into Moe's we got right in line and were impressed by how quickly it moved. The staff here are definitely really fast and efficient - I actually totally forgave them for asking to repeat myself a couple times just because you could see the whirlwind pace they had to work at during the lunch rush to keep things moving. Kudos to them for clarifying things rather than risking messing up my order just to keep the line moving. We admittedly made fun of the menu set-up while waiting, though, since none of us got why they felt the need for funny order names here. 90% of the names don't tell you anything about what you're ordering, making them totally pointless and even potentially confusing. And I mean, are fancy order names really helping you compete with places like Chipotle?  Anyway, all of our food was tasty enough, although my \"Overachiever\" tacos weren't particularly deserving of their name. They were fine and I enjoyed them, but they weren't exceptional either; if anything I think more meat and black beans would have balanced out the insane amount of guacamole they came with. I wasn't psyched when I sat down and discovered that I'd gotten a semi-flat cup of coke from the drink machine, either. And I know someone will get mad at me for saying this, but I also wasn't particularly in love with the chips. Honestly I need to start remembering to ask them not to give them to me; they just taste so bland and I get so many that I don't want them, and I feel awful throwing them out.  I also need to add something about this particular establishment - do not sit by the middle set of doors if you don't have to, especially in the winter. Unfortunately for us the only open table we could get was right by those doors, so throughout the meal the door constantly opened and slammed shut, resulting in cold winter air drafts and a small headache on my part from the noise.  All in all, this Moe's does offer very quick service and ok food, but you do need to watch out for certain parts of the seating area. They're a fine enough place to eat, just don't expect anything extraordinary either.",

They have jalapenos and black olives, which are two of my favorite toppings (besides meat). I prefer Chipotle's sofritas compared to their tofu, which is more plain. They look pan-fried or baked, but don't have as much flavor as the sofritas. I like my burrito or burrito bowl with half steak and half of the vegetarian option.  They have free chips, however mine were cold. Their salsa is also free, via the salsa bar. I love salsa. The super spicy (red) one is actually so spicy I'm impressed! I could drink their verde (green) sauce.   The staff is friendly, and it wasn't crowded at all for an afternoon. The seating outside was nice and a great people-watching spot of Market Square.  For the price, quantity, and quality, it's on par with Chipotle.",

The value is great and you get so much food for the money. I get the \"Homewrecker,\" which is a delicious and huge burrito, filled with everything you want and your choice of meat and beans. With that includes chips and your choice of salsa at the salsa bar (I like being able to get the salsas myself!). The big burrito, chips, salsa and a drink all for under $9! I also love the fact that you can fit all the crap you want in the burrito and somehow it all stays together and doesn't fall apart. As much as I love Chipotle, the free chips gives this place an edge when it comes to deciding where to go for quick Mexican. The staff is also very friendly as well.",

    "text": "I went to Moe's in Market Square in Pittsburgh PA on Friday 2-21-2014 as part of a promotional dinner event called The Winter Warm Up. I understand that each place has a set menu for this, but I feel the way I was treated by the manager Robert, was just plain shitty.   We paid $50 for tickets and there were 9 restaurants, so I assumed $5.50 worth of food at each. They had rice, bean, and chicken bowls for us. That were a little small.   I asked if I could have one without chicken, as I am a vegetarian and have been for 15 years. I thought with Moe's \"make it your way\" attitude, that this would be no problem. I was given a flat \"No\" as an answer. So, then I ask if I can take the chicken out myself and then they can put the other toppings on. \"No\" I explain that I paid to come here and I do not eat meat and they ignore me, explaining that the bowls are \"pre-made.\" So, I just take one anyways, and throw away the chicken and proceed out of the line.   At this point, one of the younger staff comes over and asks if I am a vegetarian. When I say yes, he apologizes, and makes me one without chicken, Great!, right????   No, Asshole manager Robert comes over and reams the kid for making mine Veg saying that \"We ain't got time for this shit!\" Well, excuse me?!? First of all, is it really appropriate to 1. talk like this in front of customers, children, and elderly??? 2. talk like this to employees??? 3. be this much of a jerk in general??? Also, there was no one else in line, and everyone in the restaurant had already been served... So what exactly did they not have time for???   NO ONE ELSE WAS DOING ANYTHING!?! What a jerk.

    "text": "I go here quite often for lunch to get out of the office.  As there are not many Mexican/Tex-Mex options near my work, this is my usual go-to (unless I order Chipotle ahead of time).  The employees are very friendly & quick with moving the line.   My usual order is two Funkmeister tacos - I fill up on veggies with my choice of meat (with no side of queso/guac or a drink, it comes to $5.67).  The portions are pretty consistent.  The free chips & salsa are a plus & their salsas (especially the salsa verde, which is a permanent item) are quite good.  One day I hope to figure out the recipes for them so I can make them at home.  To keep things interesting, they have a limited time item in addition to two seasonal salsas.  For example, this summer they had the Ancho Lime Bowl, which was what I got if I was sick of getting two tacos.  The two seasonal salsas (for now) are Cucumber Mojito & Light My Fire.  These'll probably change in the near future.   You get a decent amount for your money; however, the food is a bit bland, like others have said.  I'm into spice & heat.  Moe's will not provide that, BUT they will provide you with a quick meal for not a lot of cash.  P.S.  The woman who cleans the salsa bar busts her butt to make sure it's clean, especially during lunch.  She's also quick with refilling the salsa if you let her know that one is running low.",

I had to ask what the meat was. He checked me out in a hurry & just left my bag sitting on the counter. None of the ingredients looked fresh & I thought the price was a little high for tacos especially when not receiving a reasonable amount of meat & toppings. Lastly, the food was bland.

The Chicken Taco was dismal. The quality of ingredients was much lower than what you would get at Chipotle. I was also barely able to eat the taco since it was so overfilled.

Makes total sense now.  Earmuffs aka the rice bowl that was added to the menu in the fall.  I also mentioned the limited indoor seating.  Mike is trying to reconfigure the restaurant but he's at the mercy of the building owner.  This is the most efficient Moe's that I have seen.  They get you in and out very quickly.  I rarely see long lines.  Mike said they pride themselves on their efficiency.    Quality of the food is very good.  I always get steak with mushrooms, onions, peppers, salsa (tomato and corn), and cucumbers.  No complaints.    Lines are shorter than Chipolte.

    "text": "The customer service was extra friendly here and it was kept very clean however I have yet to feel super impressed with the food.   Although I do think the queso cheese dip is better than Chipotle's queso cheese dip since it actually tasted like they use real cheese and it has a nice creamy texture the flavor is still pretty mild and it could use a little bit more of a kick, however,  it was still overall more delicious than Chipotle's queso dip and it would mix nicely with other parts of the menu.  The chips were just overly salty to the point where I found it difficult to eat them however I tend to always feel this way about chips at fast food restaurants. They did have a nice crunch however and you could tell that they were freshly made even when it was late that we got them. Because they tasted fresher and more crispy than Chipotle's chips I would say they are better than Chipotle's however both of these places need to use less salt!  Although I haven't tried much on their menu yet I will say that I like this places chips and queso dip more than Chipotle's. If I was really craving queso dip in the middle of Market Square I would choose this place! My concern is that it will be difficult for them to compete with Chipotle which is directly across from them in market square being that Chipotle is already pretty popular and this place is so similar.   I would consider trying something more substantial on their menu sometime to leave a more detailed review and will update this review as soon as I do.",

Chipotle, which is right across the street from this location, tastes so much more authentic and has much better flavor (in my opinion). Moe's to me is very Tex-mex, and honestly everything seems to taste like microwave frozen dinners. The queso is delicious, but honestly their only redeeming item to me. If the service was good I would up the stars since I know a lot of people so like Moe's, but to be honest they're pretty short and snark at this location. Just not my place.",

    "text": "Been here multiple times and it is by far my favorite fast service Mexican restaurant. There are so many topping choices for your burrito, bowl, salad, quesadilla, etc. They don't limit you  either, so you can put as many ingredients as you like on your meal. Each meal you get free chips, which is a huge plus in my opinion. The salsa bar within the restaurant has a nice variety of different temperature salsa. Their queso is delicious! Keep an eye out for Free Queso Day, where they give out free cups of queso and bag of chips. This location ran this year's event very organized. As I walked in, I was asked if I was ordering food or only there for queso. I was directed to a separate line, away from the lunch rush, and given my queso within 2 minutes.   I recommend signing up for their rewards program. You receive points with every purchase and discounts throughout the year. Plus a free entree on your birthday!",

I haven't been to one in a while because I haven't liked them in the past, but I figured I'd try this one out since it just went through a renovation downtown near my work. The line was super long, and all the inside tables were bustling. This can be typical of downtown lunch time, but I decided to wait and give it a shot. I'm glad I did because the line moved quickly, and the food was really good. It's like a chipotle, but with way more options. They also have a ton of sauces and sides to put in little containers for when you eat your meal.  I'd go back here for sure. I'd also recommend using the app to order to cut the line. Moe's definitely knew what they were doing with this remodel, and the counter is so long that they're able to take so many orders at once. It's very lively inside with so much capacity and people eating, so next time I'll eat there instead of bringing the food back in a doggie bag.",

Anyway, we ordered our burritos and bowls (the chicken and tofu was incredibly seasoned and delicious), and the salsa bar didn't disappoint, as usual, to go with the side of chips that came with the burrito.

We arrived promptly at 11:30 AM and there was only two people in line!  But listen up people by 11:40 the line swelled twice the size!!    After getting our food we chose a high table by the window - overlooking Market Square - in order to people watch.  There's plenty of outdoor patio seating available - in the event the indoor dining would fill up.   I had the \"Wrong Doug\" steak packed with black beans, cheese, quac, salsa, lettuce.   I usually get the salad or taco .. wanted to try something different.  The Wrong Doug is packed with goodness and grilled on both sides and served warm..  it was delicious but too big for me..I couldn't finish it.     By the time we left the garbage cans were overflowing and they ran out of ice at the beverage station. . this location does well at lunch time.   It was a great lunch!!   Thanks Moes !",

    "text": "Moe's beats national chains Chipotle, which has a location directly across from this one, and Qdoba, in my opinion. I think it's the combo of that friendly, \"Welcome to Moe's!\" along with fair prices and free chips that make your meal feel like a meal and, thus, a better value. I'm a vegetarian and every entree has a veggie or tofu option, and the tofu is well-seasoned and delicious. They also have the best queso of any of the fast Mexican places and it's not even close. This location spent a very long time remodeling but it's worth it thanks to the less crowded conditions while standing in line -- always long at lunch but moves quickly -- and the secret to-go nook next door. I say secret because it's separate from the restaurant and could be easy to miss, but what a great help to downtown workers in a hurry. Order on the app, give them 15 minutes and there's your order waiting, like magic, along with a salsa bar and drink fountain where you don't have to jockey for position during busy times like the main restaurant next door. Also worth downloading the app for -- you earn points that can be redeemed for free food in relatively short order, and a free entree for your birthday. Great rewards program.",

    "text": "We visited Pittsburgh for the first time last weekend and found Market Square, which is the obvious downtown destination spot.  We looked around for an authentic mexican joint but couldn't find what was online (closed, perhaps?) so we ended up going to Moe's.  Moe's is like Chipotle is like Baja Fresh is like QDoba...you get the idea.  These are all counter service establishments that serve cafeteria style - pick your type of food, your meats, your fillings and customize your order.  I'm not generally a fan of this type of food and some of the things they get wrong like the rest of the chains do.  For example, they skimp on the meat - you get one spoon ladle full and the rest is fillings (I did not ask for double meat - you might try to!).  The meat itself is decent, but not what you're going to get with the places that do 'real mexican' - for example, I had carnitas but it wasn't anything like normal carnitas.  It felt like cafeteria food.  What they do get right is the same as the chains too - the ingredients are all fresh, the quality is decent and you can get a variety.  We ate in so it came with chips and I dug a number of the salsas they had.  My Carnita taco was passable and my girflriend had what amounted to a crunchwrap that was pretty tasty.  So, if you know what to expect and aren't too demanding, you can get some good food here.  And I don't know about the other reviews, but we found the service to be fine -friendly, warm and attentive.",

Anyway I finally brought my laptop home from work and was able to get some places done I had been. Sorry Yelp does not specify a date, project a date, or even require one. Yes I was at a Tom Petty concert if that gives you an idea. That does not change the details. I have my Moes App to prove my dates for rude judgmental owners who apparently go out of their way to only garnish the positive. Clearing showing the interest to get better. I was going to the state college Moes for much better service and quality. Obviously that owner has no worries. So do what you have to do. I personally give my real life experience and you solidify why it is now closed. Touche!",

I know Moe's is a national chain, but we don't seem to have too many in Pittsburgh?  This might be the only one?  Who knows.  I ordered the Julia Guilia stack ($7.22 w tax), which was essentially a vegetarian burrito panini with a hard taco inside.  The vegetarian version comes with free queso and free guacamole which is cool by me.  The wrap isn't overly flavorful, but being as it comes with chips and salsa, it is super cheap.  Speaking of salsa, the salsa bar has some nice options, and you can actually see tomatoes in the red salsa.  Move aside Chipotle and Qdoba, I think Moe's is way better.  The food is cheaper, there are more options, and it tastes better.  One issue: Why do they feel the need to do the \"Welcome to Moe's!\" thing?  The last thing I need is to be screamed at by strangers when I enter an establishment.",
