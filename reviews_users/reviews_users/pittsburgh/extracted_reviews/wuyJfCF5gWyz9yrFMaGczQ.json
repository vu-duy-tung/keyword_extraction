The menu needs to explain the dishes a bit more and the food is way overpriced for the serving sizes. I ordered he lobster roll with the the cucumber salad. Well the lobster was just over a cup of lobster meat on toasted white bread. The seasoning was subpar hello do they know salt is a seasoning 101. Same with the cucumber salad no salt and the onions weren't sliced well, I love red onion but not giant thick chunks. Someone needs to work on their knife skills. My biggest pet peeve is the no substitutions on the menu! REALLY!!! I worked as a Sous Chef years ago and that is just bad business especially with sub a limited menu. This place is trying to be a hipster hangout if just comes off as overpriced mediocre food. I won't go back or recommend. I had one of my husband's wings and they were just ok. Ribs were tender but the sauce tasted like it came from a bottle. I might try again if someone else is paying.",

Although food was fair there is no way it was forth the wait. We left at 9pm promising never to be back.",

    "text": "After attending Oakmont's \"Hometown Christmas\" event, we needed a place to warm up after standing in the cold for a few hours. Luckily, on the recommendation of a friend and local, we chose to check out Pub 333, and were very happy that we did!  The ambiance is fun and upbeat, and a bit more upscale than the general sports bar found in small towns. The bar is to the right of the entrance and surrounded on all sides by seating. The main space is full of booths as well as open tables, and TVs are scattered throughout the bar and dining area. The pizza oven is behind the bar, and patrons can watch as pizza is stretched and crafted. We sat in a booth, and though it did get a bit loud, we were still able to carry on a conversation without too much trouble.   We started our meal with some delicious red wine, and our friend had a hand-crafted Old Fashioned, which was much better than I expected. Upon seeing who the bartender was, I immediately knew why - we always had a favorite bartender at Meat and Potatoes, and lo and behold, he was now working the bar at Pub 333!  He recognized us as well, and made us a second drink of amaro and espresso liquor and finished off with a cherry. It was sublime, and something I never thought I would taste outside of the Pittsburgh city limits. The fact that they had amaro on hand shows how much faith they have in Jason, the bartender, and his ability to create outstanding drinks. This guy could make drinks at Bar Marco (which I still think is the best cocktail bar in the area). We cannot wait to return and sit at the bar, and have him mix us up some specialty cocktails.   Now, on to the food! I absolutely love wings, so I had to give the Crispy Whole Wings a try. They came out piping hot and especially crispy- we could not figure out how they got the skin so crispy but kept the meat juicy. I also shared roasted root vegetables, which were tasty but a bit soggy (maybe more roasting was needed?), and some fries, which were fresh but not remarkable. My husband had a broccoli rabe and sausage pizza, and it was a large portion for the price (enough for two meals). He said that the crust was chewy and had a good flavor, but needed more char to be perfect for his tastes. The sauce was not as flavorful. Our friend ate the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which he had eaten there before and enjoyed. Our waitress, Jillian, was on top of things throughout the night, and visited frequently to check on us. We do have a recommendation to purchase larger water glasses, since the small ones provided emptied quickly and our waitress was always on the hunt for the water pitcher.   Overall, it was a great Saturday night out, with good food and amazing drinks. As noted previously, we can't wait to go back and taste more drinks, and try other menu items!",

I think their outdated \"pencil and paper\" method of tracking reservations needs attention. I don't blame the hostess for underestimating, I blame the process in place. As we were waiting for our table we could have called to make a reservation and the call-in would have been sat first despite us physically being there waiting already. Call-ins should go to the bottom of the list.  There was a 10 top table that was empty and when we inquired about it, we were told that it was being held for a reservation at 8:30. They were going to let the table sit for 2 hours until someone on the list ahead of us suggested they combine parties at the table. Had the hostess thought to do this, and not the customer, our wait time would have been reduced.  Get on NoWait. Get on OpenTable. Ditch paper and pencil. It's 2017. Won't be back.",

Perhaps I just haven't chosen wisely, but for me their food is average and a bit overpriced for what you get. Then again, it's usually jam packed on the weekends, so it's nice to see it still thriving. Of all the menu items I've tried, the grilled cheese & bacon edges out the stuffed peppers and even the classic Cubano - the side of vinegar-based bell pepper slaw is also a winner. And the fall vegetable beef soup is flavorful despite the lack of...well, beef. My dinner companion enjoyed her mozz & prosciutto sandwich yet the roasted root vegetables were so-so. It seems that's the best we can do from a rather uninspiring menu. The decor is easy on the eyes, but falls into that all too common blueprint of vintage chic with a splash of modernity. We've stuck to the bar for our meals and service has been satisfactory. Nevertheless, I won't be returning anytime soon...maybe to check out a seasonal pasta/pie/stack in late summer when you can dine alfresco.",

The food is so-so in taste especially for the price.  Unusual menu items which is refreshing but needs help.  Lobster Bisque was served luke warm and basic in flavor.  The Panzanella salad was very good but too large of a serving even for 2 people; that is a side dish not a meal.  The crab cakes are very small, no taste, not enough aioli sauce on plate and pricey for nothing else on the plate. We will probably give it another try in a few months since this is a fairly new restaurant.",

It was a small top split hot dog bun with a few tablespoons of lobster salad that was mooshed up like tuna salad. Not a single lobster chunk. Not worth $14.00 for a tiny sandwich and sliced cucumber salad. We had a good laugh though. They do not have a dessert. We left and went to Oakmont Bakery for a cupcake.

    "text": "For now, I have to give Pub at 333 this rating exactly - A-OK.  We stopped in shortly after they opened over the Fourth of July weekend.  They have good food, but it's not amazing and the prices are a little bit steep.  We have other places in Oakmont we prefer to eat, but I would definitely give this place another shot in the future.    We started with soups - Bobby got mushroom and I got their lobster bisque.  His was just OK.  Mine was delicious.  Very, very good bisque.  I ordered one of their salads and asked to add chicken to it. Bobby got their lobster roll.  My salad was very good, however, the chicken seemed processed to me. I probably would not order a chicken dish again for that reason.  Also, I thought it was weird that out of 6-7 salads they offer on their menu, not one of them had protein on it nor does it state the option to add a protein.   Bobby got their lobster roll and while it was tasty, it was an extremely small portion for $14.  This past Sunday, we stopped in for a drink during the fourth quarter of the Steeler game.  There were only a few other clusters of people throughout the restaurant - two parties of 4-6 eating dinner and three parties sitting around the bar watching the game.  There was a polite hostess and the bartender took good care of us.  They had a nice selection of seasonal beers.  I love the atmosphere in this place. It's dark and industrial while still being chic and cozy.  I love the floors and the tables and the decor.  I will say, however, that both times I have walked in to Pub at 333, I don't get a very welcoming feeling.  Workers are always polite, but not the most friendly.  That could just be my opinion, though.",

Would defiantly recommend for anyone! If we didn't have homemade pizza @ home we might have tried the pies.",

    "text": "*Update: My wife had convinced me to give this place another try being as it's been several months since it has opened and I'm glad I decided to listen to her. We went there for Sunday Brunch and not only was the service much better this time around but the breakfast food was really good. Plus it was surprisingly inexpensive. I haven't been back here for dinner but their Sunday Brunch has definitely changed my mind about this place. Planning on going back for dinner soon.  Would give this negative stars if I could. Initially I was happy to see a nice new restaurant come to town so close to where we live. Unfortunately I was VERY displeased with this place. For starters when we walked in we were seated right away which was nice, however it took our server 20 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I know this because I kept track of the time while we were waiting. By this time the table behind us which sat down 10 minutes after us already had their drinks and order in. Finally 15 minutes later our server finally shows up with our drinks after I approached her about it. The food was ok at best and very overpriced. There was absolutely NO kids menu so it's definitely not a family friendly place. Asked for a side salad with my meal and they could only offer me an $11 Caesar Salad. There are much better restaurants in the area so I would advise saving your money or go elsewhere.",

Plus we love farm to table and trendy food, so we EXPECTED to love Pub 333.  The portions are small. This is acceptable, IF the food is very tasty and well seasoned.   Pork belly was boring. Serenity Hills is the local pastured pork that's the most tasty; it's where Cure and most chef-driven restaurants source their pork. This pork tasted like it was purchased at the day old section of Giant Eagle.  Salad's dressings were again, unflavorful. The service was pretty bad, even for a gastropub standards.  I've heard the drinks are tasty, but it appears to have died down in newness. I don't hear of many people returning.   The space is cool and full of potential. I want to like it. I'll return if the menu is revamped.",

Then once we were seated we got our drinks promptly and scrolled over the menu.  Menu had a nice selection so I went with the lobster roll with roasted root vegetables and my Dinner partner got the lobster bisque and pulled pork nachos. After a while we noticed the people who came in after us were getting their soups and nothing came to our table. We flagged down the waitress and she thought we already got it when we obviously did. She brought it out right away.  Then the rest of our food come out right after. Everything was pretty good except my lobster roll was basically lobster with small cut up pieces of celery ect... was thrown on a huge not appetizing piece of lettuce which I took off. The root vegetables were good except a few pieces were under cooked. I have to say the nachos were the best thing about the meal. We're fresh made and delicious. They do have an open kitchen so you see them prep the food.  I think this place is way understaffed for the volume of people they serve. I would try this place again but now it know what to expect. Be interested to see how the pizza is.",

There were about eight of us sitting at a table and when it came time to split the bills it was a complete disaster. People were getting charged for items that weren't theirs and slips were being 'misplaced' by the server. When requesting to see the manager, the server said they were unavailable. Splitting checks for a party is not an uncommon or difficult thing these days. This server continually talked down to one of my colleagues and charged her for things that she did not order. It became very frustrating that we had to just leave without having the check resolved. This left a horrible impression on us and we will not be returning. It's really a shame because the food and drinks were great, the server just had a horrible attitude and was reluctant to resolve our issues. He was not representing this establishment well what so ever.  Such a shame.",

We got the crispy fried wings, black and bleu shrimp and margherita pie. We were both hungry and we even had leftovers after we were done. All three dishes we got were delicious. I love dry rub wings and their wings were probably one of the best I've ever had. There was nothing I could complain about the shrimp either- I could devour the sauce by itself! They did amazing on the classic margherita pie. We had so much food we couldn't even finish it.   * Cost vs. Worth: Most of the pub plates were between $10 - $15 and it's so easy to share with another person, especially those wings ($14) and pie ($13).   Will I come here again? - 100% yes. They have a bunch of other plates that I want to try as well!",

We were told that we could sit at a bar table or outside, we found a table and then 10 minutes later a very rude hostess came over and told us that \"These are reserved and that we can't sit there!\"   It was so extremely rude, there was no indication that this table was reserved. We had already settled in and were enjoying the atmosphere and our drinks. When I complained to the bartender, he was also rude about it.   I am super easy going and this just rubbed me the wrong way and there is no way I will go back.. because... they made me leave my seat and stand! There were no other places to sit or stand at the bar so we were just left in the middle of the floor holding our drinks awkwardly!  If they would have explained to me that they needed the seat because they made a mistake and forgot to put up a reserved sign I would have understood. But they made it seem like it was my fault! Even though they initially told me I could sit there! Ruuuuuude!",

Our service was very good. Didn't drink today so I can't speak to how the alcohol is. The food menu is great, certainly more than your standard pub fare. I had the Spicy Fried Chicken sandwich.

The space they occupy was converted from a Bruegger's Bagel shop a couple of years back if that gives you an idea of how small and crowded it gets.

The pizzas are fantastic and cooked in the brick oven, but equally good are the salads, appetizers, burgers and other items. We often will get the blue & black shrimp, the meat & cheese board or the hummus as an appetizer. We have had the fish tacos, gyro, burger and any type of pizza - all delicious. The service is awesome. By far the absolute best of the three restaurants under the same ownership - the Lot, Carnivores and Pub 333.

    "text": "We've had good experiences here but it seems like management is not paying enough attention.  Several times, including tonight, we have arrived and been told there are no tables for two available. So we sit at the bar and pay attention to the empty tables for four that stay empty the entire time we are there until after we leave.  Maybe they are reserved?  Then the hostess staff needs to be better at timing the seating of tables.  The food is quite good but not consistently.  I've had the caprese panini in the past and liked it.  The balsamic drizzle is delicious and the arugula works well.  Tonight I ordered it and there was very little cheese in it, at best two very small pieces of it (across 4 large triangles of panini).  There needed to be almost as much mozzarella as tomato.  This place has a lot of potential and I would even say it's good.  For Oakmont it is very good.  It could be great if management was paying closer attention to details.",

We were given water, ordered these amazing great pub fries, served perfectly hot & tasty, ordered our lunch....waited 35 minutes, waiter then said there was a mix up in the tickets???? and our food, burger, sandwich, soup, would come out directly. another 8 minutes and we received out food, burger and sandwich were great, soup was cold. sent it back...and yes you guessed it...they microwaved the soup....great....and oh...serving my burger on a plate with a sizable chip missing and sharp edges...not cool!",

    "text": "We came here for my wife's coworker's 50th birthday party.  It is in a small plaza in Oakmont.  There is parking but there wasn't a lot of space.  We had to pull out of the parking lot and find street parking near by.  It was Saturday night and it was packed.       We walked in and they were extremely busy.  We found where our party was and was directed where to go.  Unfortunately, there were no seats for us at that time so we just found some seats at the bar until we figured out what was going on.  They had an area of the restaurant for the party but we couldn't tell which was which.  I don't think this restaurant is the best for parties like this or a private party.  They did set up a small buffet table for party guest only.  Since we were at the bar I went to get some food and I brought it back to the bar.  I guess workers didn't know I was withthe party so they said something but the hostess knew that we were guest and she told them that it was ok that I got food.  Kind of awkward.         The bartender was nice although I didn't really care for the selection of beer.  They didn't have too much beer on tap.  They have cocktails on tap though if you like that.  My wife ordered a Manhattan which she enjoyed.       We sampled their nachos and pizza.  It was better than average and I would eat it again. The food on their regular menu looked decent too.  When the restaurant died down we could relax a little more and it's nice restaurant in Oakmont.  You can watch a sporting event good here and the atmosphere is good too.  Just was disappointed with the lack of beer selection.",

    "text": "Updated: I got take out here and it was soggy and lukewarm. The fries were not good.   I really didn't expect it to be like this when I walked in, but I couldn't find a single thing to complain about. I can be a bit hard on Oakmont sometimes and really wasn't prepared to give 5 stars, but here I am! I sat at a nice bar table. The waiter was fast and friendly. The menu was honestly the perfect size and had many vegetarian friendly options. The food seemed well thought out and the prices reflected that. I ordered the Margherita pizza and an order of fries with the gorgonzola cheese sauce. It came out in a good time and was really delightful! Thin Roman-style pizza with a truly excellent sauce. Perfect size to split between two people. The plates, salt and pepper shakers, dishes and water glasses all were carefully thought out and had their own creative flair to them. It felt classy! They make their pizzas in a woodfire brick oven, so this place means business. Not just a regular small town bar. Nothing but praise for these folks. Will return!",
