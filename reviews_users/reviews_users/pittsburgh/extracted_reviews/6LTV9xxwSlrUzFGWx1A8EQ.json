You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30.   Overall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots.",

    "text": "Before you buy into someone's reviews too much it would be helpful to look at their rating distribution (like the only 5 star rating person below me). But anyway, this place is average at best. The gyro I had tasted mostly like every other gyro have had except that the lettuce and cucumber sauce was not evenly mixed in it so I would bite into huge globs. The base Gyro price was $4.95, but the guy behind the counter sold me on the 'lunch special' that came with fries and a drink (came out to $8.50). Well, that was a mistake. You barely get any fries and they aren't that good anyway. Ketchup is served in those old-school refillable plastic containers. The interior looks like it hasn't been updated since 1968 and so it has kind of a grimy look to it. This place doesn't accept credit cards. Come on...let's call up Marty so we can get back to the future here.  I don't plan on coming back.  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars Price = 2 Stars Service = N/A (you buy at counter and take your food elsewhere) Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 2 Stars",

It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal, which is a good deal. The fries were cooked to perfection, but lacked flavor. I had to dump salt on them, which is never a good thing unless you as for unsalted fries. The gyro itself was mediocre. The ingredients inside were fresh and made to order, but I did have to use a knife and fork to eat it as the pita was just a bit too small of the large mass of the contents. The slice of chocolate cake, while a descent size, was rather tasteless. The icing was pretty good, but the cake itself had almost no flavor, perhaps freezer burn. It did seem as if the cake had been frozen. I also felt like the harried girl taking orders behind the counter was overworked. She apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables. I kind of felt bad for her.   Overall, I'd go here if I worked a block away and only had a half hour lunch break. Quick and cheap as a fast food joint, but not delicious enough as a dinner.",

    "text": "I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!! Why would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place.  I live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!! Sure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes.  The food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling.  I always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that.  The pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce.  I bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there.  There is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \"unsavories\" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all. Keep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way.  You will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!",

There have been many a long and stressful work day that has been turned around by the great service and attentiveness of the staff. The night staff is always quick with a smile and conversation, which goes a long way for me,  since I'm usually alone which can be awkward.    The lunch service can be a bit hit or miss probably because it gets really really busy during lunch , but their late night service is much better.    I go to Salonika's no less then 3 nights a week.  The bartenders are super friendly I even consider Brain the night bartender a friend.   There are other upscale places to eat and drink in the vicinity but if cheap eats and drinks  and friendless is what you're looking for you can't go wrong with Salonikas.  Also please be aware they are now serving Mimosas!  Which are super yummy and served in a martini glass with a twist of orange!",

I ordered shock top which was on tap. I was so pleased because it is a seasonal beer. The place is clean but I would never take my kids. The bartender will talk your  ear off but was a nice person with a little crazy added on. I felt like being in a \"just got out of jail\" commercial with everyone coming in to buy a 40 from the beer cooler. If I am ever back in town and plan on going to a game I will grab a sandwich from here for sure!",

The fries could have been cooked a minute or two longer. We had to add salt. The pita on the gyro was small and soft. I was worried it was going to tear or break but it didn't. The gyro meat was okay but not as flavorful as other places I've eaten. The sauce didn't hold much flavor either and was a little watery.  Though I wasn't impressed, nor would I go back for the gyros, I would go back to try some of the other items on their menu. They had a baked Greek chicken with lemon potatoes that seemed to be selling more than the gyros were.

    "text": "I have been here several times in the last year. The food is average...kind of fast-food-like. It sits in the warmer cases, and looks \"crusty\". The gyros are average, not as good as the ones at the South Side gyro restaurant, by any means.  The salads are from a bag of pre-chopped lettuce, and not \"fresh\" or interesting.   But in order to enjoy the average food, you have to get past the really rude food wait staff.  The bartenders seem to be OK, the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars, and it is a \"cheap drink\" attraction to some downtown locals.   The staff that serves the food, and takes the orders are out of this world rude. There is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers, and after having endured her, I will never, ever return. Owners should know how they are being represented at the front register. The man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious, or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect, that he is just deaf to it.   Go somewhere else. It is cheap food, and you get what you pay for. I would pay twice as much, to feel like the staff gave a crap that I was there supporting their jobs.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Salonikas on 6th St. over a dozen times over the past three years.  I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me, the gyro here is the best in Pittsburgh.  Better than ANY other.  Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.    Seriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \"Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.  I like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!    I like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.    I like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.    And all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.  And best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.  And keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \"the prices are cheap, and tastes it\".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.  My favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.  Oh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.    Now, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.  Until then, this place is the best for me.",

    "text": "I guess I'm not enough of a \"critical eater\" since I don't think it should be anyone's mission on Yelp to tell everyone how mediocre or bad everything is. Anyone who is truly in such a perpetual funk shouldn't even bother crawling out of their subterranean lair, let alone take the time to write about why everything supposedly sucks sod. I'll just go ahead and discount their compulsively gloomy reviews as much as they'll disregard mine, thank you very much.   Having gotten that out of my system, I can say with sound mind that I rather enjoyed my gyro, french fries, and chocolate cake at Salonika's after having taken in a show at Heinz Hall.   It wasn't my first choice (Meat & Potatoes was full), and we only went into Salonika's since it was only other casual restaurant open at that hour in the immediate vicinity, but I have no regrets.   My only complaint about my El Cheapo dinner was that the gyro wasn't the best constructed sandwich one could eat. As with many a gyro, it fell apart halfway through like David Lee Roth did during Van Halen shows back in the glory days. The tzatziki sauce was also placed messily atop everything.   Hint: My favored gyro joint, Brookline's It's Greek To Me, not only uses a bigger pita wrap, they also tidily place the tzatziki sauce BELOW the meat and vegetables, making your munch session stress-free.   Despite having to tackle this thing with knife and fork, I found that the straight-from-the-spit meat was nicely fragile and correctly seasoned. The pita bread, like that found at It's Greek To Me, was delightfully toasted, not to mention plusher than a comforter.  Hey, I order french fries at Greek restaurants as they go famously with gyros, and these were pipingly crispy and golden.   Salonika's great, they gave us chocolate cake...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJcVcRMS4ejQ&s=c5d6a5a5d8488f1312fecd5fd8d850d6b0b9e2c2600d2b16232a6ee660bc3d79\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=JcVc...</a>  If you're unfamilar with the above stand-up comedy concert the above link is from, you have a DVD to rent. The cake almost had me doing Bill Cosby's goofy dance. Not that this was on par with anything from Bethel or Oakmont, but it was simple, joyful bake-sale fare with a goodly rich (or richly good?) fudge icing.   Yes, Salonika's also offers Moussaka, Chicken Athena, Spanakopita, and Pastitsio among other Greek delicacies (all displayed under glass to tempt you) along with the usual burgers, wings, and hoagies. The service is fine albeit somewhat hurried (we didn't feel like we had time to peruse the menu board). You order at the counter and wait until your number or meal is called. After ordering, the young woman who waited on us asked us how we were and what show we saw while she scanned the restaurant, pre-occupied with the motley assemblage of friendly, boisterous reg'lars. I'm betting they were mostly taxi drivers, although we did see some fellow in business casual attire with his face in a laptop computer, so I guess that means they have Wi-Fi?   P.S. The soda fountain is self-serve, which is always a perk.   P.P.S. They've been around since 1986! I didn't even know they existed until I joined Yelp.   P.P.P.S. They'll bus your table for you once you're finished. Due to the eatery's self-serve nature, I assumed otherwise, much to the amusement of employees and loyal customers alike who jokingly asked if I needed a job. I don't know that I'd want to work there, but I would return to try more of their menu.",

I had the beef/lamb original gyro. The meat was so tender and tasty. Yum!  My friend really enjoyed the Athena chicken.  They have extremely reasonable prices. There is not much of an atmosphere, but for cheap prices & great food you can deal with it. There is also a bar in the back, which is a bonus. I highly recommend it.",

It goes a little something like this: Order at the register, pay at the register, take a seat, wait 5 minutes for food to be delivered, inhale gyro and BAM! I can make it to the theater with enough time to find my seat and browse the playbill. The gyros are pretty good. I prefer mine with about half the provided onions and with the gyro sauce on the side so I can really slather it on. The staff here is always friendly and the prices are reasonable. This is an A-OK place all around.   Bonus: they are open fairly late. So if you haven't left yourself any time to eat before a show in the cultural district, you can stop in after the show is over (Yup, I've done this too when I'm EXTRA terrible at planning).",

    "text": "I stopped by last night for dinner with CM after we'd spent the afternoon at Duquesne University, since I had a City Dining Card for Salonika, and it'd been awhile since CM and I had had Greek food. The first thing to note that surprised me a bit is that Salonika doesn't provide table service--orders and payment are accepted up front, and food is provided on trays that you take to a table in the dining area.  The staff bus the tables, which clearly needed doing at the time of my visit.  Based on other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the rosemary half chicken with lemon potatoes ($7.39), and CM did the same.  While the flavor of this entree was decent, I found it extremely greasy, and I suspect the chicken wasn't of the best quality, since pieces of bone kept breaking off and ending up in my mouth.  As for the lemon potatoes, again, the flavor was on point, but the texture was off, such that they were mushy in some places and so hard as to prevent chewing in others. The sauce on the plate from the potatoes had a great flavor, which I used to dip the chicken and complimentary pita bread that came with the entrees into, but it was also quite greasy from the chicken.  CM and I also decided to order dessert, with him ordering the baklava and me ordering the chocolate cake, which looked super-tempting in the case.  I'm happy to report that the cake didn't disappoint--it was substantial and moist with thick, fudgy icing and a pleasant, though unexpected, tinge of anise flavor.  I tried a piece of CM's baklava, and enjoyed it as well--it had a generous coating of honey, and plenty of chopped nuts.  Overall, I found the food at Salonika to be inexpensive (at least, for entrees and the Cultural District) and flavorful, but to be lacking somewhat in execution.  I'd consider returning the next time I'm downtown and have a craving for Greek food, since I believe Salonika is one of the few gyro places downtown that stays open beyond lunch hours.  If I'm looking for a nicer sit-down dinner, however, I'll pass Salonika up for one of the many other restaurants in the vicinity. 3.5 stars.",

The ceiling tiles are stained and don't match, the chairs don't match and the booths a probably the original ones installed when this place opened (I know they've been here for at least 20 years).   The service is fast, the wait staff is friendly but the Greek meatballs I had today were unimpressive. They were dry with a charred coating. The tomato sauce that covered them however was delicious and the rice that came with the dish was puffed and fluffy. I would have been happy with just the sauce over the rice.   I don't dislike Salonikas and I'm not trying to dissuade you from coming here.  I'm sure I'll be back again for gyros and beers. But what I am saying is that there's room for improvement thus earning the three star review.",

    "text": "I wanted Greek food for lunch, so tried to stop in to Christo's across the street.  Strangely, there was no one in there at 11:30 on a Thursday - no one eating, no one apparently working, so we crossed the street to Salonika's and I am happy that we did.   When you walk in, there is food under glass and you walk up to the counter to order.  There is a menu on the board - gyros, salads, moussaka, etc.  I decided to follow my friend's lead and get the Zeus chicken - chicken, spinach and feta in phyllo with green beans in tomato sauce.  After paying, we got a number and took our plastic silverware to sit down.  It's definitely old school in here with benches looking like they came out of the 50's, but they were comfortable and clean, so I'm not complaining.    The food came out extremely quickly on cafeteria-style trays.  A large phyllo burrito filled to the brim with spinach, feta and chicken with a nice pile of canned green beans in a flavorful tomato sauce.  There was also a tray of pita bread.  All in all, it was pretty delicious.  My friend also got a piece of cheesecake which looked pretty tasty.    For 10 bucks for the meal and drink, it was a decent amount of food and very filling.  I would definitely go back to try other specialties.",

It was after 10:00 pm and you could not get a bite to eat in the hotel.  So we walked down the street - most places were already closed, and a couple of places that were open that had bars - were no longer serving food.  Fortunately we found Salonika Gyros! We both ordered a traditional Gyro, and they were prepared fresh and hot on the spot.  We knew we must have a good place - as 3 of Pittsburgh's finest from their police department were taking a dinner break and eating in here as well.  The Gyro was damn tasty! The meat was succulent and perfectly cooked with a slight char to it, and the yogurt sauce was just the right compliment to the Gyro!  Salonika is not much to look at - it's your local working man's food joint in a traditional northern blue collar city! Which means it's great ambiance! Appreciate it for what it is!  I'd definitely come back here for more Gyros and to try other stuff!",

It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town, the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.  Also, almost $9 for a small gyro, frozen fries & a small drink is not a \"deal\". M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large, delicious gyro.  I dunno, I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours.",

Salonikas might be cheaper than McDonalds if you really take into consideration all that you're getting. My husband always ordered a gyro dinner and I sometimes got the falafel, veggie plate, or one of the daily specials. Nothing fancy. But that's my thing, good doesn't have to be fancy. For Salonikas to get a decent crowd for dinner despite several other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants on the same street, they have to be doing something right.",

My lessons took place in the Fulton Building, next to where the Renaissance Hotel now stands. My favorite thing about taking piano lessons was the visit to Salonika's afterwards, where the smell of garlic was replaced with the smell of meat. My mom and I would feast on gyros and fries, and it all seemed incredibly gourmet to me. Fast-forward 30+ years and Salonika's is just a wonderful, though perhaps not as gourmet from my 30-something perspective. The gyros are amazing and the salads are big and beautiful. At under $10 for lunch, it's my go-to spot for comfort food. So, if you've been under a rock for the past 30 years, go check it aht!",

My gyro met standards. My french fries tasted like they came from a freezer bag, but that didn't mean they weren't addicting when I smothered them in ketchup.   People working there were pretty nice, and one of the ladies working behind the counter was sassy in a funny way. Salonika Gyros is a good place to eat when you aren't looking too hard, and you're craving a quick gyro. However, there are better options at a similar price point in the Downtown area for gyros. it was a fun place to eat with my friends during Pittsburgh's light-up night. If I wasn't with great friends, it probably would not have been as enjoyable. This spot got three stars because it could improve in certain areas, especially since it owns a prime piece of real estate in Downtown Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "You had me at gyro. And chicken. And Baklava. And Rice Pudding. And french fries. And gyro. And... oh yeah, I should mention I went a couple of times this trip. Returning within the same trip is a VERY good sign.  Well, that and they were next door to my hotel and on the block with Starbucks. But it was more the food here.  Okay. So, my first night here I was starving. I had planned to have lunch, the very next day, at a place I attend every year I come here, to indulge in one of the best gyros I have ever had. It is tied with a place back in New York, where I live, and I look forward to it every year. With that in mind, while overjoyed there was a gyro place next to my hotel (that was open until midnight I might add... gyros at midnight? Are you freaking kidding me? That's awesome!)...  So where was I? Oh yeah...  So, with the next day's gyro in mind, I rocked this place with a visit and so happy I did. I ordered the gyro with fries straight off. I will admit, I was still thinking of the next day as I waited. But that all changed when this fresh, delightful sandwich was set down in front of me. And then when that first bite hit my mouth, it was all over. It is up there with the best I have had.   I should list all the things we tried. My wife is Polish and actually ordered their pierogis the first night and she said they met her standard. Last night, and let me preface it with \"OMG\", we tried the cheesecake baklava, and wow... Then we found out it was made off-site, but the owner asked us to try (after we were completely stuffed) two things that he said would make us want to move to Pittsburgh, that he made himself onsite: he came back with rice pudding and standard baklava. OMG, EXCLAM! He was right. I have the movers on hold as I write this.  If you're into roast chicken, try it. Whatever he puts on the skin of that chicken is, surprisingly, legal and not sold by a dealer. I couldn't stop eating it despite getting quite full. Oh yeah, the fries were fresh, crispy and good the way \"diner fries\" should be.   Suffice to say if you're into gyros, there is not enough good I can say. And, it's a good thing too because, when I went to the other place the next day, I was dismayed to find they were closed. Yet I wasn't disappointed; I found my new place in town.  There's a new gyro in town. And, his name is Salonikas.   For dinner last night we had the pleasure of speaking to Takis, one of the owners (or THE owner), who came over to the table and had a lengthy conversation with us. As I mentioned, he had us try some of his greatest hits and they were triple platinum fo sho, yo!   Tak gave us his history and he's been here over 30 years. I confirmed that this would mean he was here when that original Bally's fitness was open next door (the old sign my landmark when I'm in town), to which he added, he saw our hotel when it was a disco back in the 70's!  Overall, eat here. Eat here a lot. Keep this place open. It has a lot going on and guys like Tak are one-of-a-kind rare. Well done Salonikas and we'll be there on our next trip. Get the baklava and gyros ready!",

I liked the Hummus but I didn't like the Pita(that's why 4).  Overall rating: Service - fast and good Quality - really good, little worried on the hygiene (vegetarian food is kept with the everything else, its concern for me)   Cost - perfect $  Ambience - not that great as food is served fast and people eat faster and place is moving little fast.",

There were only a few patrons at the bar so I was able to immediately order and pick a good window spot. I ordered the house Gyro (their speciality), as stated on the menu and .... O. M. G. people; it did not disappoint! This was the best gyro I have ever had. It was flavorful. Fresh. Juicy. And topped with crisp, cool, freshness. Give 'em a try. You won't be sorry!",

    "text": "This is one of those places that seems to be hit or miss.  I really enjoy their food most of the time, but I've also had meals that were off or just not that great.  For a greek restaurant, they have a nice amount of choices.  Standard greek items like gyros but also things like moussaka.  I tend to have better luck ordering things like the gyro or gyro salad then the more specialized items.  This might be because most of the food is pre-prepared.  They just heat it up when you order it.  Because of this, I've had moussaka that was either luke warm, or warm but super dry on the edges.  The gyros, on the other hand, seem to be more fresh, and the fries are generally fried when you order them. I do enjoy the variety of side dishes they have available.  Fries, lemon potatoes (probably my favorite thing on the menu), rice, green beans, salads and sometimes a chick pea salad.  It is nice to have an option other than fries when you want something that isn't fried.   This is an establishment where you order at the counter and they call your name when your order is ready. There is a nice sized dining room with tables, but they don't actually bring your food to the table. Staff is also widely varied.  I've had cashiers that were overly friendly and accommodating, and others who acted like I was bothering them by having them take my order. If the food and service were more consistent, I would have given it more stars, but I've had an equal number of good and bad experiences which is why I gave it the lower rating.",

The seasoning used on the carrots, potatoes and onions that accompanied the lamb was absolutely AMAZING.   The pierogis were an equal compliment to the main dish with a sweet onion sauce poured over them - STELLAR!  I don't know that I will ever have a chance to visit again as I'm from Wisconsin, so please order an extra side and eat it for me!",

The potatoes are so well cooked and delicious, and the pita bread has a hint of sweetness to it, and of course is so soft, warm and delicious!

My boy and I were going to the symphony, but he was hungry (starving, Dad!), with about an hour and a few minutes before the curtain. He likes Greek, so we stopped in and really had a great meal! Quickly prepared, great service, and really good food! The boy had a gyro and some chicken (yeah...he was hungry, like a 10 year old boy can be); I had the pastitsio and some rice. Delicious! Very reasonably priced. This will now be a fairly regular stop when we're heading to the PSO - so says the Little Man!",

The lamb was tender and flavorful, and the tziki sauce was just right.  I would go as far to say it was the best Gyro I ever had.   So good in fact that for lunch the next day prior to leaving for the airport I stopped by and tried the chicken Gyro.    Outstanding!!!     Next time in Pittsburgh I will be sure to come again for an excellent meal at a very reasonable price.",
