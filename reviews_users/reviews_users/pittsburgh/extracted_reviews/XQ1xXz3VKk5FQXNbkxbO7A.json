The waitress quickly took to the kitchen to have a new dish started for me. In less than 3 minutes, the manager was at our table. He apologized for the problem, took the dinner off of our bill, and even gave us a gift card towards our next visit!  Everyone at this restaurant is kind and attentive. It's one of our favorite places to dine. Our dinners are consistent, as well as our favorite drink, the long island lemoncello. Delicious every time!",

The girl who answered the phone right away said that she knew about the missing items and would get a manager to speak with me. After being on hold for 10 minutes I hung up rather frustrated. A few minutes later manager, Michael did call me back though. ( had my info from the order)  He apologized and offered a $20 gift card to make up for the mistake. This was to be sent via email that night or the next day.  Feeling a little better about the situation after speaking with Michael we began eating.  Kids noodles with meat sauce on the side- a very large portion of noodles and a teeny teeny tiny cup of sauce. :(. Side of extra large brown broccoli. I tried a veggie noodle dish. No taste whatsoever. We also had chicken Alfredo. That was ok. Nothing special. Salads were brown and full of those huge hard lettuce ends. They were thrown right out. That's such a shame because I love the salads. I guess... at least the breadsticks were good?",

We know it's not from Italy, we know the ads are a lie and we know this is \"Americanized Italian.\" Like many world travelers, I've been to ltaly once and my parents 3 times, so in my family  comparisons aren't close. You won't be dining on the Piazza Navona so get over it. I have no reservations or naivete I just understand it for what it is and nothing more. They put out an interesting product and feature creative dishes that do hit the spot sometimes. I'm pretty lenient on them but let's not fault the individual restaurants and staff because their corporate hierarchy portrays it as authentic.",

We had the seafood brodetto and shrimp primavera, along with some house wine, and were satisfied with the taste and quality of the food. The minestrone soup was also good.   The main downside for us was that the waiters were cleaning up other tables while we were eating and the cleaning liquid had a not-so-good odor.   The interior is pretty much similar to other Olive Gardens I have been to. Decent, but chainy looking. Where we sat was somewhat dark, which could be good or bad. We considered it romantic -- if not for the odor of the cleaning liquid.   If you feel like eating at a chain (which is likely your unavoidable fate while you are at the Mills) , this may not be a bad choice. Tell them beforehand not to clean up with odorous liquids, however!",

My fiance and I haven't had OG in a long time, so since it was Valentine's Day weekend we said hey why not OG. Shocked that it was not a packed house since it was Valentine's Day, but we did go late around 9pm. No wait at all! They was offering a sip of some white wine, we said sure we're try it out. My fiance looked at his glass and it was dirty, so our waiter went to get him another dirty glass. My glass was dirty as well. The silverware and plates was not cleaned well too. We ordered an app, the stuffed mushrooms (very very good) my fiance ordered the wedding soup (he felt it was not enough meatballs) he had the tour of Italy (the lobster in the pasta was so tiny, it was like a gain of rice, OG needs to be a shame to serve those small pieces of lobster to their customers). I had salad (not enough dressing) and I ordered something new since I always get the chicken parm, shrimp Carbonara it was good excepted they left the tail of the shrimp shell on the shrimp. I like to eat my pasta without stopping to take off the tail first. I was shocked and disappointed that they got rid of the raspberry cheesecake. This was not my best experience at all at OG. I think I will continue to go to Monroeville. The waiter I forgot his name, but he was sweet, nice, and polite.",

We (3 adults & 3 kids) were seated in a large comfortable booth.  The breadsticks with a vat of alfredo were a hit.  One serving of the fried cheese served all of us.  The picky eaters were able to tailor their meals.  I would have preferred spring greens to head lettuce in the salad.  The children enjoyed their pizzas. Two of the adult meals were the sirlion.  The meals were cooked to preferences.  I had the shrimp scampi. The noodles reminded me of ramen.  The dining room was empty when we arrived.  A family of 3 were seated in the 6 person booth behind us.  The infant had ear-piercing screams from the front door, through the meal, and out the door.  It doesn't reflect on the restaurant but definitely decreased our enjoyment of the meal.  BEWARE:  There is a \"gameboy\" on the table with a credit card slot.  The children decided to pass it around.  I received a video game charge ($2).  At no time did the \"gameboy\" ask for my credit card to start use.  The waitress explained once a game is opened charge automatically appears.  I thought that was sneaky.    This restaurant was a convenient meal option but not a future \"let's go to ...\" option.",

The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. My only complaint is that the seating wasn't particularly thoughtful. For example, younger couples were seated next to extremely noisy families with screaming babies, older couples were seated in dark areas and couldn't see their menus, and younger rowdier teens were seated near middle aged adult couples wanting to enjoy a quiet evening nowhere near teenagers. It was a bit chaotic to say the least. My husband and I were practically seated in the kitchen and were subjected to wait staff chatter throughout our meal. Also, for most of our meal, we were literally yelling at each other over the noise and unable to enjoy a simple conversation. I don't understand why multiple babies are allowed to scream for 20 minutes or more and the staff never ask the parent to handle the situation. A toddler was throwing food and nobody said anything.   If I'm getting a fast food experience, why am I paying for a restaurant experience? The food is always so good, but we end up leaving very prematurely with to-go bags because it's difficult to stomach your meal under so much stress.",

    "text": "Last night I ate dinner at the Olive Garden in the Pittsburgh Mills Mall, Tarentum PA. I only ate about half of my eggplant parmigiana entree, and asked for the rest to be boxed. Just now, I put my leftovers onto a plate to heat them up for lunch, and a large piece of solid metal tumbled out from underneath my leftover eggplant parm and onto my plate (pictures attached). Luckily I saw it before I took a bite, but it was large, solid, and undoubtedly would have broken a tooth or been a choking hazard.   Just wanted to let your restaurant know that you are likely missing a chunk of some sort of kitchen equipment, and I have it!",

Nothing more unappealing than cold Alfredo sauce. The other thing is the food was just hurled on the plate. Honestly go to the store and make your own Italian dinner.",

We looked at each and decided to give it try, hoping it doesn't stink in the seating area.   It did.  It was horrible.   Look, I know its industrial grade Italian and wasn't expecting anything spectacular, however, cleanliness is important to me.      Once the server arrived we decided to leave, we explained to her that it was horrible stinky and she said we get that all the time!   She blamed it on the cheese that gets dropped on he floor! .   We split, heading out the door and the hostess asked what's up and we explained and she said she'll let the manager know.  Oh yeah, last thing, this smell reminded us of Houlihans in the mills when it was open.  You were greeted with the same stank dank smell.  Not going back.",

My recent visit was the Chicken and Shrimp Scampi(upcharge to do it was fine) but here it came out with asparagus and red onion in it and no fresh herbs, nor any dry herbs, and no sauce. I  could taste no wine, garlic, lemon, or butter! My wife had Chicken Parm with Fettuccini Alfredo, again, hardly any sauce to no sauce! The bread sticks have got to go. These were so salty that not even the wildlife would eat them. Its a wonder how this chain cant get their head out of their ass and do better! Try any other Italian restaurants unless you like sub standard food.",

Soup was good though.",

Yes, it's cookie cutter in every way, but the soups are all very tasty and the salad is always as expected:  fresh and ready to go with their signature house dressing.  So when you are not on an epicurean adventure and you really need to count on quick service and a fast and enjoyable lunch - hit the OG for endless soup and salad.  It will be exactly what you expect and nothing more.",
