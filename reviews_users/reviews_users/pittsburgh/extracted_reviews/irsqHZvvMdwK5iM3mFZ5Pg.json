    "text": "So my dad and I are in pittsburgh for the penguins playoff game tomorrow. We got in and decided to stay at the Marriott this restaurant is in. After we were done unpacking, we went downstairs and decided to eat at this restaurant. I was greeted very politely by the manager who sat us down. He told us that our server would be right with us and that if there was anything wrong with out experience to associate with him. So our server came and greeted us. My father ordered a red zin wine and this is were everything came to a disaster. I don't want to bad talk the server because he was really nice and it wasn't his fault but the bars. First he gave my dad a white wine. Ha that's funny because zins are red. So my dad told the waiter that he ordered a red not a white wine and the server gave us his Sincerest apologizes and took it back. Another waiter asked if he ordered a merlot, to which my father said no and told them what he ordered. So the other waiter apologized and left. Finally my dad got his wine and we ordered an appetizer. We ordered the chips and onion dip which our server said was homemade. He brings us the chips and they look like they have been pulled out of a factory made bag. I could tell it was not homemade. Not only that but we got like 5 chips! When someone says something is homemade I expect it to be homemade. So we order dinner, we ordered the same thing. The bacon cheeseburger. I expect a lot from any burger I eat because I know good for bad in that department. I could tell the meat was most likely steamed as it looked white-ish. My dad enjoyed it but I thought it was terrible. I asked the waiter for a side of aioli for my fries and he went to go fetch it. But you know what he came back with? Bacon jam. Seriously? How do you mess that up? So we eat then we decided to try dessert. I got the ice cream sandwhich which was expresso ice cream with some sort of salty sweet chocolate thing to put on top and bottom of it. It was way to salty to be considered a dessert. My dad ordered a cobbler. He said the ice cream was good but the cobbler was absolutely terrible. I do not recommend this place and will not ever come back here.",

The food was ok, but not much of it on my plate.  I get they are trying to be a high end restaurant but when you pay $40 for a plate of scallops and get 3 scallops and 5 sprigs of asparagus, not really worth what I paid.  My wife's portion and food was off the charts good.  All she paid was $9.  The waitress was very nice.  Not sure I would go there again.",

They have a limited menu and even more limited when the Penguins are at home. I had a filet mignon steak with mushrooms and fries for $30.  Glad I ordered it medium-rare because it was closer to medium.  Would have expected a baked potato or mashed potatoes.   Had a side order of Broccolini (new to me - it is long stemmed broccoli) for $6 and a bowl of clam chowder for $8 (decent).  They didn't provide any bread which was surprising.  I ended it with white chocolate mousse with orange whipped cream, gingerbread and pistachios.   If you have a Pittsburgh entertainment book you get 20% off and they also are on the b1G1F card.    Other items on the menu:  Burger, turkey burger, Chicken sandwich, Salmon, Short ribs, pasta and a few salads/appetizers. They mentioned a buffet before the Penguin games.",

Told the waitress the salad was \"strange\" and chicken questionable after not eating my dinner and she smiled, took the plate, yet charged me for it.  No sorry, or would I like something else.  $14 for the salad, to be exact, half of which was for the mystery meat.    Trust me, walk the extra 10 or 15 minutes and get dinner downtown.

Finally someone asked if we needed help and we told them we had a reservation they preceded to tell us that the restaurant was not open but the cafe was so we could take our seat there. We took our seat and were given a cafe menu. We had already looked at the normal menu online and knew what we were getting and were disappointed it was not on the cafe menu. So we asked our waiter if there was anyway we could order off the other menu since when we made the reservation no one told us the restaurant wasn't going to be open. The manager came over and let us order off of the menu but then when we got our bill we were up charged for the items we got which we were not told about. Also when the manager took our order we told him we wanted one rare and one medium rare steak. When the steaks came out the waiter put them in as one medium rare and one rare and this problem was not corrected. Although they try to accommodate us it worked out less in our favor then in our favor and we were very unhappy.",

If you're following along, you know that I should really know better.    I learned an interested factedote today--PA liquor laws force restaurants to buy wine at the same price that it retails.   That might explain the wackadoo pricing all over town, and especially at this place.   I'm getting incredibly sick of places that call themselves \"wine bars\" that serve Mark West Pinot Noir, Sterling Merlot and Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay.  Not all of these suck, but not exactly what one looks for in a wine bar.    The food.  Why call yourself a \"brasserie\" if you're serving average american hotel food?  My \"pan roasted chicken served over fresh pasta\" was a big old bowl of fettucine alfredo with chicken hunks and some artichoke hearts and mushrooms thrown in for flavor.

The place was empty, that should have been a hint.. Waited there for good five minutes and then started making some noises, finally one server showed up. Gave us a table, a good table, not bad. The server was not clear, she gave only one wine menu for all of us - really! Drinks came on time, no issue but the glasses looked less than adequate. Did they give enough - who's measuring? We ordered food - some of the dishes were expensive. Two of us ordered monk-fish. Never seen such a dish, looked more like a soup - a bland one at best. The quantity was also not much for $29 - really. Two of us ordered steak which was also quite small. One of us ordered salmon burger, that one looked okay. But when the server delivered the food, she spilled fried all over. They did not try to accommodate that - they should have at least replaced the fries. What kind of service is that. Not going there any time soon - not good at all.",

The appetizer bar is hit and miss, some things are good, but others are just ok.  There's always a salad option, and they've added a cheese tray which is welcome.  They have pasta available and you can put your choice of sauce on top.  If you want to can just order the app bar, and there is enough there to make a meal, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price.  For a place named after salmon, I'd say theirs is only a little better than average.  I've had black cod here a few times (a more recent menu addition) and it's very good.    As far as wine goes, their selection is really weak considering they are branded as a wine bar.  Also, the prices are not good.  You can do much better elsewhere.  For a nice dinner before a Hockey Night in Pittsburgh, I prefer The Carlton because you get your parking taken care of and the wine selection is much more expansive and better priced.",

Expecting the usual staid hotel bar, imagine my surprise when I stumbled in there for \"after the other bar\" drinks on the way up to my room and found a bustling bar at 1am. It helps that it's one of the closest bars in proximity to the Penguin's arena, but still, it's a hotel bar that people actually go to.   Due to the fact that brasserie and wine bar are now tacked on to the name, they think they can charge $9+ for glasses of wine. I'm not so into that b/c it's Pittsburgh. The Stoli and sodas were a more reasonable $6 and some change (compared to the neighborhood place down the street where I could get a Stoli and a beer for $6). Anyway, the crowning glory of the Steelhead was their chicken strips and fries plate that is served late night. The manfriend declared them possibly the best chicken strips he had ever had (see we don't always just eat crudo and cassoulet). More than one plate may have been consumed during the course of the weekend, but what can I say?   I do hazily recall laughing with some people at the Jackass video on the tv, which was fine with me. It's a very unique mix of P-town locals, hotel guests, and after the game people hanging out. 3.5 stars for a good time.",

I enjoyed my time there but see nothing special with it. Know that I am willing to pay for experience - and offer the following. Be prepared to pay $5 for domestic draft beers that excludes gratuity. My experience was no more special than another bar that serves adult beverages in front of tvs. I did not eat at the bar, and wouldnt because I saw the typical deep fried cheese and chicken strips that are sold at any tavern, ugh...and would probably be charged a premium. I did enjoy being around people who were overall nicely dressed and well behaved, and my bartender was very nice, professional, and well educated.",

    "text": "Salty Sizzling Steak Marriott Midnight Meal - IMRANTM I had not been to Pittsburgh since last century. It was around the same time of year around 1997. Landing there this time on a late night flight meant I didn't get to see much on the ride to the downtown Marriott there. I checked in just before the last call for the hotel's restaurant. I was exhausted from an all nighter because I had a flight cancellation from Tampa to New York around 4am. So I had to scamper to continue my meetings remotely.  It was supposed to be a Tampa-New York early morning flight and a New York-Pittsburgh evening flight. But I had to get the last available flight after my meetings. And it was a Tampa-Pittsburgh flight with a change of planes in Atlanta.  I hate connecting flights. With one hour connections you barely make it from one gate to the other, as happened on my outbound flight. On the return I ended up at Atlanta airport for four hours waiting for a delayed connection. It just adds unneeded drama or life-sucking time-wasting delays.  In any case, I got to the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center. I had not even had time for a proper lunch. I avoid heavy meals late at night, especially near midnight when I have to up at 6 am for 7 am meetings. However, at the Marriott the menu choices were limited. But at least they had a place open.  Since childhood I've been too much of a red-meat lover. So I ordered this filet mignon with crab cake, veggies, and mashed potatoes.  Much that the meat and meal could be rated as great, and much that I'm grateful for every meal, fancy or otherwise, I'm blessed to have, I have to warn you -- this steak must have been marinated in a salt mine!  I could literally feel my blood pressure rising from the salt intake.  But there was no time to ask for a change, so I imagined it was a chef special recipe that made it so salty.  I'd definitely order this again but hope someone there pays attention to the salt thrown in the meal.   2019 IMRANTM",

My husband had the mushroom truffle burger which he is still raving about 2 weeks later.  I had the cobb salad which was excellent!  The presentation on it was fancy (once again referring to my jeans and tee shirt) but I loved it.  It was a little pricey, but what would you expect from a Marriott restaurant?

You can go just about anywhere in Pittsburgh for more value and taste for the money -- including just blocks away at the Bigelow Grille @ The Doubletree Hotel (in case you just like eating at hotel restaurants).  Ordered the grouper.  It was $31.  The fish was very average in every way.  It came with about 5 grains of reheated rice and a stripe of sauce on the plate that somehow incorporated the vegetable (cauliflower).  If it had a pro, it was probably that it was a low-cal dish.  Yep, there was about 200 calories worth of food on the plate.  Man, am I hungry.  The whole experience screamed \"how much profit can we make since someone was stupid enough to come in eat here?\" ... looked around at other plates, including those at my table.  Much of the very sad same.",

It had the bar menu though, and it was a comfy seat, so I was at least happy about that. The staff was attentive and answered all our questions. But....then came the food. I have been staying at Marriott hotels my whole life. I have come to expect a higher caliber from my Marriott experiences and this was not it. You can do better than Steelhead, Marriott.  I ordered the clam chowder, which I was told was their popular item. It came out looking like chunky sausage gravy. It had obviously been sitting in a hot kettle since morning because most of the water had evaporated from it and was no longer a soup consistency. The clams were chewy and way over cooked. The flavor wasn't bad, but it was too strong due to the lack of water. Maybe if you had it for lunch it would be good since it would have sat in the kettle less. We also ordered the crab nachos. Little bit of crab and a lot of chalky cheese sauce. My husband ordered a Manhattan and got a fruity drink in a highball glass. Overall, I won't be coming back here except for a glass of wine.",
