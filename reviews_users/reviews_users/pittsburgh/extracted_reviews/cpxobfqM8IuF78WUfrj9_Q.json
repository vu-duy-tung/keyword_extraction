Please see my attached photos.  I bought 2 Philly Cheese steaks and they were AMAZING!    I don't know what kind of fries he uses but they were fantastic.  I ate half of one and took the remainder back on the plane with me....IN MY CARRY ON!!!  The staff was friendly as well.  Bad neighborhood?  I don't think so, come to they Bay Area and I can show you bad neighborhoods.  It was safe enough for me, a Central Asian, to go in, have my order freshly prepared and leave my uninsured rental car outside.  FYI:  The place is closed Friday 1-2:30pm (or was it 2:15, I can't remember).",

The four of us had finished our August Wilson Tour of his Hill District haunts, hangouts and mentions in his Pittsburgh Cycle of 10 plays.  We wanted something light to eat and had heard of Grandma B's from a web search. We were not disappointed.  We had arrived at a busy time for this bustling halal eatery at 2537 Wylie Ave. but a friendly greeting and a quickly assembled table for four put us at ease.  We were in the back, overlooking the small counter and food prep area. Service was quick, pleasant and welcoming.  We ordered from the simple menu: I had a turkey club with fries, my wife  had a fish salad [not on menu but our waiter suggested it would be OK], our two friends opted to share the \"monster fish sandwich\" [which is enough for 2].  Folks, this is simple food inexpensively priced and served simply.  We all cleaned our plates 'cause the platters were tasty!",

    "text": "I stopped by while visiting Pittsburgh and ordered the Philly cheesesteak, and I would definitely go back for it. It's hard to find good halal places like this. While the man was making my food he offered to throw in some fries, just so I can try them since he said they were really good. I said no, only because I wasn't that hungry, and didn't want them going to waste. Next time I'm in town I'll try them for sure.   The place is definitely a hole in the wall, and sort of a bad location, in the middle of nowhere, on a pretty empty block. It looks like one of the old school burger joints; big bar counter and a few tables. The brothers who worked there were super pleasant and made me feel comfortable in a room full of dudes. They do close for Jummah on Fridays, around noon, so make sure you call ahead if you plan on going around that time.",

    "text": "Written on the wall behind the Grandma B's counter: \"If you don't like the food, your stomach's lying.\"  My stomach told the truth about the Dirty Grits and Home fries I ordered.  As well as the sample piece of French Toast, which was probably the tastiest I've ever eaten.  Dirty grits contain--you guessed it--grits, plus peppers, onions, cheese and shrimp.  Very good and very filling.  Didn't stop me from plowing through the home fries.  And then, we'll, there was that French toast.  I overheard several patrons ordering breakfast sandwiches, and since Grandma B's is a neighborhood joint with regulars, I'm going to presume that those are a safe bet....so think I'll try one on my next visit.  Speaking of which:  on my next visit I will bring cash, because it's required.  Not only do they not accept American Express, they don't accept any form of payment other than green pictures of dead presidents...or founding fathers, in the case of a Benjamin Franklin.",

    "text": "While visiting Pittsburgh from Chicago, we just had to stop by this halal establishment. We ordered the cheeseburger, Philly cheese steak with fries and sweet tea.The food was hand down delicious. The sweet tea was quite good as well.  Only thing I didn't appreciate was the service. We got to the restaurant around 3pm after driving an hour out of our way. Since the business is listed to close at 5pm, we were kind of taken aback by the attitude of headchef/part-owner who announced that he is ready to close down the shop and leave for the day.This happened right after we walked in. Though we were happy he took our order, he relentlessly complained to his other co-workers about how he is ready to leave and had it for the day. There was no sign of the door stating that they were closing two hours early for the day. As a customer, I was really uncomfortable with my 2 year old son. I really wish that I wasn't treated this way because the food was delicious and halal. I hope the management/owners read this to improve their service standard. Now, the service doesn't have to be a five star restaurant quality but customers should be treated in a decent manner.",

They also have a couple larger tables toward the back of the restaurant that seat around 4 people each.  My boyfriend and I shared a Philly cheesesteak with fries and a breakfast plate with pancakes, sausage, potatoes, and an egg. Their Philly cheesesteak by default came with a few toppings that aren't normally on a Philly cheesesteak (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo). I personally thought this made the cheesesteak better, but my boyfriend didn't agree and took them off. Fries were delicious. The sausage on the breakfast plate seemed overcooked and the egg was definitely overfried. The pancakes and potatoes were fine.   Although I wish our food came out faster (took about 25 minutes total), the kindness of the owners made up for it.   Taste | 3.5-4 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5-4",

I was looking at Yelp for some brunch places and this one was one I  came across that happened to be open the day after Xmas!! I AM SO GLAD I SAW THIS! Honestly, I've never been to a place where the people and the food were amazing but this place just blew my mind. Not only are the employees and the owner awesome as hell, but the customers were chill too! Now the food.....One word: HEAVEN. Ughhh if only I lived a little closer to this place! Thankfully I'll be around the area a lot, so I'll definitely bring some cash with me and stop by as frequently as I can! 5/5 stars all day, errday for Grandma B's",

Between us we had the French toast, the fish sandwich, the veggie omelette, home fries and grits and no one in our party of six left disappointed. This is definitely not going to be your classic restaurant experience. It's a very tight space with a couple larger tables in the back and a good amount of bar stools. Beverages are bottle service only so if you sit for a while just plan to make a purchase. It's not a big deal though because the price is absolutely right! There is little on the menu that will cost you over $10 and that is even after tax. It's definitely a good hidden gem if you are just outside of downtown or looking to sneak away from the hustle and bustle as a group of one or two.",

GB's in seven years appears to have become a neighborhood institution.  Dorian, the owner, seems to know everyone who comes in the door and those who are hanging around outside.  I feel like he will remember us when we return and ask about how school is going for my son.   The place is narrow, with a counter extending to the back and a few two tops (so seating for a dozen or so).  We went for a late lunch on a Wednesday and didn't have to wait to sit at the the counter (although another patron nicely moved to make room for the four of us).  We sat in front of the grill and talked with Dorian through most of our meal.  His younger brother and one other helper make the place run smoothly.  We ordered at Dorian's suggestion: Al's Special (eggs, french toast, potatoes and bacon), Steak and Eggs (the sauce on the steak was delicious), fish sandwich with fries, and a sort of poutine (shredded chicken, cheese, Dorian's sauce).  We finished everything.  The steak and eggs was our favorite.    Dorian is the star here, knowing his customers and making them his friends.  He told my son, who is attending graduate school at CMU, to come with any problems he has and Dorian will help sort them out.  Really nice experience.",
