All I could taste was lemon.  They must of changed pita suppliers.  The new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake. My wife's dinner was bland. We were there on a gift card that still has another 5 dollars on it and I'm not sure we'll even use it. It was that bad. My hope is that they fix their problems. It used to be great.",

    "text": "Easily the worst service I've ever experienced at a sit-down restaurant. We had a confirmed reservation for a party of six at 7:15 on a Saturday evening. We arrived at 7:10 but were never seated until 8:01 because there were no tables available (isn't that the point of making a reservation?). We then endured a horribly unfriendly waitress who ignored us for the first ten minutes; when she finally came over, she told me that I couldn't have a glass of water because they were \"out of water glasses right now\". (She brought me a water 10 minutes later.) I ordered the mixed grill kebab; as she brought the entrees, the waitress dropped my knife on the floor and walked away. The kebab chicken and shrimp were good, but the filet was overcooked. Overall, I would give the food a 4, the value a 3 (rather pricey for the location), and the service and attitude of the staff a zero. Don't waste your time or money at Amel's.",

It is an eclectic place, tastefully done and offers inside and outside seating.  My favorite is sitting at the bar which is a split bar, like a mirror image.  There is something magical about this place in addition to great food.  The lighting in the main dining room is artful--adorned by CX design lighting like walking into a forest of glowing hanging flowers. For starters we had the humus sampler which was a meal in itself.  I had a hankering for something different and went way outside the Mediterranean venue and right into the meatball hoagie.  I don't know why, but I did and was so rewarded. I am finding the breads in Pittsburgh to be their best kept secret.  My wife had the grape leaves as a diner and it was such a generous portion we needed to take it home. One of our guests had a lamb kabob, that was tasteful but the lamb was a little tough to cut.  I f I get to Pittsburgh again, this is a must.",

If you are going at a peak time, reservations are a must here because it can become quite crowded and the dining style is relaxed, so tables do not turn over quickly.  The menu contains Mediterranean, Greek and American fare.  The hummus appetizer is a must on regular visits and the sampler is a good choice for introducing the place to a new comer.  The hummus comes served with a warmed pita, bread and onions (yum).  The wine menu is quite limited, but it offers a favorite 'pleases everyone' wine we drink sometimes, so it does not disappoint.  For dinner, we have tried everything from kabob sampler, magic carpet rides and other chicken dishes, beef tips and salmon.  Entrees typically come with a salad that comes with a signature house lemon vinaigrette.  The salad really is dressed to the nines with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives and feta.  The food does not try to be fancy, instead just fresh, classic dishes.  The desserts are delicious and very highly recommended, so if you are too full, you certainly will want to get some to go.  Service tends to hover around average, so nothing to complain or write home about there.  After a bottle of wine, two meals and often dessert, our bill typically runs over $100, so it is not an everyday place, but certainly a place that you will want to come back to.",

    "text": "Note #1: This originally was intended to be Review Update #100, but the ball doesn't always bounce the way ya want it to, does it?  Note #2: Their website is obviously dead. I think that's the 2nd one they've been through. Hopefully they'll get their net-fu in gear at some point.   A review for Amel's is what began my crusade on Yelp. Feeling that I had unfinished business with the place, I decided to come full circle and bring Kay here to give Amel's another chance for a rare, impromptu Monday night date.  You see, the few times I have dined here, I was not gastronomically devastated by a magnificent meal. Instead I had a supper that was alternately memorable, lackluster, and flawed.   Somehow the lively, bright atmosphere that I experienced over 2 years ago fell away this past Monday night, leaving a more intimate, romantic vibe in its place. Amel's truly did seem like it had become a completely different establishment to me since my last visit. In this regard, it is a chameleon.   Our appetizer was a serving of Pomegranate Couscous Scallops. An immediate classic, this alone made me glad that I chose to revisit and reconsider Amel's. The scallops quivered, inviting us to sink our forks and teeth into their beautifully tender, seawater-imbibed flesh. The tangy yet candied pomegranate sauce caramelized the couscous, turning it into something not unlike toasted, ground almonds, all of it flattering the scallops immensely. Erotic seafood: Amel's has invented it, and we wanted more.  Kay's dish, Shrimp Aphrodite, only furthered this end. Tomato-blessed angel hair pasta served as a bed for plump, goat cheese-loaded shrimp. The pasta alone was exquisite enough without anything else, but the shrimp and goat cheese transformed  it into something obscenely luxurious. Shrimp and goat cheese together are a marriage made in the sweetest, most decadent circle of Hell ever imagined. Erotic seafood: Amel's has perfected it, and we were spent.  Note that I only had a taste of Aphrodite; It was Kay's after all, and it was so seductive, she allowed me to sample it with reservations.  Staying away from Shish Kebobs, I opted for the Lamb Shawarma and found myself enthralled by yet another sinfully ambrosial culinary union; fresh ground lamb and hummus. Housed in a crisped cylinder of pita bread and embellished with chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion, the reddened, savory meat merged with the lush, lemony hummus to create the ideal Mediterranean bite many times over.    Our server, Nikki, was so positively Olympian, I felt as if I was overtaxing her by slurping down so much lemonade (I had just gotten off work and was dying of thirst!). Never were Kay and I left with empty glasses, and she did it all with a smile and a streetwise verve.   We passed on dessert since Kay wanted to go to the Rita's nearby, but please don't pass on Amel's as my previous, middling review has been rendered irrelevant.   P.S. Our bill this time was close to $43, averaging out to about $21.50 a person. Keep in mind we didn't get dessert and that Kay's dish was around $16. My shawarma was half as much.   P.P.S. I forgot about the french fries that accompanied my shawarma. They were peeled, done steak-style, and were quite good  P.P.P.S. That obsidian genie on the sign at the front door is still so very kvlt. He should appear on the cover of the next Melechesh album...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DISU_82MnMoY%26feature%3Drelated&s=4693fbd7cf80ff6aaf36bf8d2932a6489c7279650fe4861136bef19118baabb0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=ISU_...</a>  I want it on a t-shirt.",

An addition into an adjacent space is in the works.One problem that cost a full star off the rating - only two beer selections on tap - think river water product. Other selections available in bottles, but let's face it - a great fish sandwich becomes a good fish sandwich if the brew with which to wash it down is not gratifying. Perhaps a request for EastEnd Brewing is warranted?",

I ordered both the beef and chicken schawarma to sample.   The beef:  - clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' as opposed to freshly shaved off a doner. - a measly 2 slices at that, I basically had a wrap of lettuce and tomato w/ a hint of beef  The chicken:  - clearly a once frozen and somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast again as opposed to being freshly sliced off a doner and a mix of white and dark meat. this leaves the meat dry and tasteless.  - maybe a half of a chicken breast if I was lucky  No toum or similar sauce served at all with either dish?!?! That's hitting a whole new low for fake schawarma.   Hostess was great, service was adequate. I have no motivation to return.   Hopefully one day Pittsburgh will have good choices when it comes to Greek and Med. food. Today is not that day.",

    "text": "I live in the neighborhood and I must have driven past Amel's 5 dozen times before saying Hmmmm...maybe I'll try this place out.  I went out for my birthday dinner and would happily go again, and soon! It's a perfect place to grab some food if you are trying to eat a little healthier...it's also a great place if you don't care as there are a wide variety of menu options. My problem was that there was so, so much on the menu that I wanted to order that I by the time the server came by to ask again, I had to throw up my hands and know that I would have to come back many times to get everything I wanted. I also wasn't all that hungry. Always so annoyed at myself when I go to a new place that's actually GOOD and can't eat that much--the worst!  I started with their summer beer on tap (I think it was the Summer Solstice) which was very good, crisp, and flavorful. My appetizer was grilled artichokes stuffed with goat cheese (awesome.) Since I wasn't very hungry, I got a soup and salad for my meal. The fattoush salad was very good and I would happily order it again. The specialty soup was a cold cantaloupe soup and it's why I had to knock off a star. It tasted mostly of sour cream, but outside of that didn't have very much flavor and I really love chilled soups! No one at my table enjoyed it that much, but as far as missteps go, it wasn't a huge one.   Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals and drinks without complaint. We sat on the patio on a beautiful summer night, which added to the experience. The shrubbery is situated just so, ad we didn't feel like we were right off of busy McNeily Rd. Parking can be a bit of a hassle since the lot is so small and shared with many businesses, but we just parked across the street. Not a big deal.",

Service: Decent - the only reason I decided on 4 stars, instead of 5. Waitress was friendly, but not terribly attentive (perhaps because they were busy?).

My table ordered the mezze platter which had grape leaves, hummus, artichokes, and another type of dip I forget.  All of them were great.  The grape leaves and hummus were my favorites.  They continuously bring you fresh warm pits bread throughout your meal.  Our entrees were a gyro salad, the combo kabob, and a lamb burger.  All were delicious.  The combo kabob was lamb, filet, shrimp and chicken, all cooked to perfection.  The lamb burger was also cooked perfectly and tasted great.  For a place that doesn't specialize in burgers, it was crafted perfectly with a brioche bun.  Will definitely be back!",

So it's refreshing to have Mediterranean food that isn't just a gyro with fries. Lovely to have seafood that isn't just breaded pollack with potato chips.  I don't know how fresh or authentic any of the ingredients are or what they are doing in the kitchen, but at least they are trying and pulling it off. At least they aren't the one millionth lousy pizza place in Pittsburgh. Very nice folks of course. Homey understated atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Definitely worth the tab.",

    "text": "What a great find (thanks to yelp!). I have lived in the area for a long time, and McNeilly road is simply one of those roads that I never have a reason to travel.  As a bonus, the weather today made seating outside the optimum choice.  I ordered the Moroccan Couscous, which included chicken and lamb, with the fatoush salad.  My companion got the Chicken Taboo, which included hummus, also with the fatoush salad.  Both meals were full of flavor and fresh.  The seasonings, such as saffron, really set the meals apart.  Although we were there during the lunch hour, our meals were dinners.  We are stuffed!  The parking is very limited but there is a large lot across the street where the Aldi is.  Maybe parking is OK there? We got lucky - we got the lone spot right in front next to their sign.  We walked maybe 10 feet.    The outdoor seating is nice, with umbrellas to keep the direct sun off. I did notice ash trays on the tables.  If there were smokers present, we would have eaten inside.  Service was quick.",

We started off with the she crab soup and French onion soup. Of the two, the she crab was my favorite. It had chunks and was not overly sweet (like some seafood soups tend to be). The French onion was decent, though had too many onions. I did like that the bread that came in it was a bit crispy, which was an unusual, but pleasant surprise.  The meals came with salads, we ordered the Amel salads. The dressing was interesting. Enjoyable enough.  The steak tips and mushrooms - I feel like they could've been better if she asked me what temperature I wanted the steak cooked. I like my steak more on the medium rare side and it was more on the medium well, very close to well done side. The sauce was different and yummy. I think the mushrooms helped. The veggies and mashed potatoes were both tasty! The lamb shank - the lamb fell right off the bone. Very juicy and flavorful. My friend was in food heaven.",

We also loved the Shrimp, the Grilled Peaches, the Grape Leaves, the Spanakopita, and the Baklava for dessert was the perfect ending.  And to make things even better, we happened to be sitting at an outdoor table right next to the owner Ralph, who made us feel right at home.

But don't forget to to tip. How about doing some basic training. When a drink is bone dry there's a good chance the customer might want a refill. Bring the soup or salad before the meal. Bring desert before you bring the bill. You want butter with that warm pita? How novel! Perhaps you could offer a free hour glass so we could have some idea of when to expect nourishment. Exceptionally bad !",

They also have a fantastic outdoor patio in the front, street view, but very charming.  Our waitress was not nice (no substitutions for anything we quickly found out) but she got the job done and checked on us numerous times. I went with the Mediterranean omelet which had feta and tomatoes in it. The omelet was almost as big as my plate, very tasty with a lot of cheese and veggies inside.  The brunch entrees are all served with a choice of sausage or bacon and home fries. It was enough to fed two at a very reasonable price of $10. they also had pancakes, waffles and a few other egg dishes you could pick from (gyro omelet). I can't wait to go back for dinner and try some of the entrees.",

It seemed nice inside and not what you'd expect. It's not a big place so a reservation would be best. We called ahead only about an hour on a Saturday night and were able to get a table outside. It's located in a shopping plaza so parking is not an issue.   The menu is a combination of Mediterranean and Italian food...two of my favorites! They have a variety of options all at a reasonable cost. Portions are big as well. Hummus appetizer was a large portion and very tasty. Side salad had a good amount of feta which I love! For my entree I had the pasta Athena with salmon. I didn't care for the salmon. Salmon is my favorite fish and this was very fishy. It did not taste fresh at all. I would never get the salmon again but the pasta was great so I get that with shrimp or just by itself again. My fiance had the crab cakes and they were full of crab! I'd get those again.   All in all if you're skeptical of this place don't be! It's a great restaurant in the south hills and I'm sure I'll be back.",

I was back recently when in the area and was happy to find that everything is as perfect as it has ever been. Amel's famous weekend brunch is really something not to be missed. There are so many delicious choices. Fried Feta in Filo Pastry, people!! It is mind-boggling how delicious it is. It's so good I swear my vertigo kicks in with every savory bite that hits my mouth.

    "text": "Full disclosure! Driving by Amel's it would be easy to confuse this place as a more \"dive bar\" type establishment (maybe it's the neon genie) HOWEVER, this is one of the best restaurants around. I am so fortunate to have found this place, and to have had such a great experience.  From the moment that I called Amel's to make a reservation, the hostess was the most wonderful person. She was so friendly, and accommodating. Ok, so I walk through the door expecting to see red leather booths, oh no! Maroon Velvet walls. This place's decor is outstanding, so beautiful, so funky. I loved everything about it.  Our reservation was later, but somehow.. even though the place was PACKED on a Saturday night, we were seated almost right away (we just expected to grab some wine at the bar)  The hostess, again.. came through and continued to do so throughout the night. She was so friendly, and just buzzed around talking to everyone and making sure everyone was having an enjoyable evening.  The menu selection is HUGE, with a ton of vegetarian options. I however got the salmon, which I have to be honest about.. I was not a fan! It was very, very, fishy and salmon is hands down my favorite fish. I was not in favor of how it was prepared (I'm assuming broiled) didn't have much flavor to be honest. However, with the service, the ambiance, and the rest of our food and drinks, I hands down give Amel's a 5 star review.  The rest of our food was great, the waitress accommodated our needs by asking if we wanted our appetizer with or without meat.   I highly recommend making reservations, and highly recommend Amel's I can't wait to come back!",

Well let me just say one of the best birthday dinners I ever had, and my family thoroughly enjoyed everything that was on the table. We started with 3 orders of grape leaves (they are THAT good- and my nana makes these herself and I would say they are almost as good), an order of hummus and tabouli. Appetizers: winning!!!!! The family loved it. Next for entrees we got an assortment of kabobs, mine was the kabob sampler that came with grape leaves and eggplant with lamb and marinara on top.  All of our meals came with the Amel's salad that was truly special with the lemon and mint dressing. This is a new favorite spot and I am so pleased with my dining experience here tonight!

They have a cute outdoor seating area that's great when the weather is cooperating.   I ordered the shrimp and chicken kabob, and the shrimp was some of the best I've ever tasted. You get so much food with your meal that you're probably going to be full before you get to enjoy your entree (but that's not really a bad thing in my opinion). The grape leaves and hummus are very good as well. This is a great little spot if you're craving some middle eastern food.",

My food was excellent and it was done super quickly! I ordered a Moroccan sampler that included steak, chicken, and shrimp! I was thinking it was going to be a kabob but it was surprisingly a decent sized filet, chicken breast and 2 (maybe 3) large shrimp. The meal also came with green beans and mashed potatoes. I do wish it was just the meat and the tabouleh salad that I had as a starter.l but I'm not mad at overeating once in a while! The steak had goat cheese, a berry sauce, and a mint sauce. All were exceptional!",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try Amel's because I had heard great things, but my experience there wasn't as great as I had imagined. First, parking was a pain. Even with the lot in the back, there was still no room. We had to drive around 5 times waiting for a spot to open. We just thought it meant that it was a super popular place so we were even more hyped to try it. The entrance to get into the restaurant is very confusing. You would think that it's the main door you see when you first pull into the parking lot but it's not. One of the workers told us to go around to the side door but the side door said \"do not open.\" Then we had to walk to the back and found another door to let us in. You have to walk through the dining area just to make it to the hostess stand. We made reservations for 7pm and we got there at 6:55. We weren't able to be seated until about 7:20, which was a little frustrating. They must've been very busy. The dining area is very small. Due to it being so small, the walkways are narrow so it can be difficult to maneuver inside. There are only about 20 tables. Putting in a reservation is definitely a good idea. Our server was very nice and prompt, which was a plus. She brought our food out almost immediately. I ordered the chicken kabob. It sadly didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for but it was still good. Normally I always take a to-go box but the portions were not very big and I was able to finish everything in the restaurant. It was a nice place to try but I probably will not be back in the future.",

The food is tasty and its always been reasonably timely.  I've never eaten anything I didn't like here.  As a bonus, they have always used olive oil to prepare my meals per my request.  For some of us who are afflicted with having to be cautious what we eat, it is important to know where we can eat out without feeling like the servers and cooks hate us.  At other places, they may be unable or unwilling to accomodate.  That's, of course, fine.  We can go somewhere else.  This place, though, I trust.  You will find quite a wide range of prices on the menu which for some may be desirable: higher end dishes and more frugal meals for others depending on your need;  and the desserts look amazing, though I've never eaten them.  I got the french onion soup (I forgot to get a picture of it).  I order that as often as I can but this is the first time eating it here.  It was very tasty and unique from other places I've had french onion which pleasantly surprised me.  The atmosphere is friendly but not what I'd call relaxed.  It has a more lively feel.  Still, 5 stars!  We shall be back.",

These dishes could easily have been shared between three or even four people. Everything was delicious, the wait staff was respectful, and the restaurant itself had a comfortable atmosphere. There is also a very nice deck outside in which people opt to eat at, but unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate that day. Overall, I definitely recommend!",

No, this restaurant is the type where you leave your cell phones in the car and plan to dig in to high-quality sit down experience.   The food is almost indescribable. It's the real deal, the food includes flavors that you didn't even know existed in middle eastern type fare.  I had the shrimp kabob. The shrimp tasted so so good, big, and perfectly broiled. OMG!!! The spanacopada was to die for!!!  Amel's is not cheap at all, so we only go on special occasions. But man-o-man, it's so worth it. Between me and my wife, we dropped $60 last night (including the tip), I didn't regret a penny of it, and I *never* spend more than 12-15 dollars on my meal --- until I found Amel's,  LOL.   Think of this place as being up in the ranks of Mt Washington joints, just without the view!!! Our server was a young woman named Amber and she was excellent -- took care of us well, and made us feel pampered --yet without being at all annoying about it.  Amel's is high class.  Just do it.  -- Mick",

    "text": "Another great trip to Amel's! I had the vegetarian grape leaves this time, and I DEFINITELY prefer them over the traditional meat ones. I am not saying the meat ones are bad, I just prefer the creamy rice filling in mine with a squirt of lemon juice on top; so light and delicious.   The only thing that kind of bugged me is that when I got the grape leaves, the waitress very kindly explained that appetizers were half off with purchase of an entree (I guess a happy hour special). I enjoyed them so much that I decided to get another order of them to go for tomorrow's lunch, and she said she had to charge me full price since I was getting them to go. Huh? Kind of odd to me but I still agreed to purchase them.  My SO had the Caesar salad and the gyro platter- he really enjoyed it but wished it came with a dollop of hummus as he would have loved that with his gyro. He also thought perhaps it should come with a bit more pita to build your own gyro. As soon as he asked, the waitress brought more free of charge. He also thought that $8 for a side Caesar salad (he didn't add cheese, I got a ton of feta on my salad so I gave him some) was a bit much- I agree! They need to have better prices for their side salads- although it was delicious and great quality ingredients, it was not the size of an entree salad so it should not have been $8 in my opinion.   I got the Mediterranean angel pasta again (I just had to see if it was as good as I remember) and if even possible, it was better. This time, it had a bunch of fresh herbs sprinkled on top which just added to the freshness and vibrancy of this heavenly dish.   You have to give this place a try. Their food is fresh and vibrant, and the decor in the dining room is awesome!",

I've enjoyed many items off of their special menu which changes weekly. They usually have very solid appetizers, and excellent specials. Whether you like seafood, beef and the occasional pork dish it usually appears on the special menu. One dish that stands out usually appears around the Fall season is the Orecchiette with chicken, cranberry and sage in a cream sauce. Incredibly rich, but so good.  One of my favorite items is the Filet with shrimp. Always cooked perfectly and the shrimp are of a nice size. Another standout for me is the Lamb Jasmine. Lamb scaloppine sauteed in a tomato sauce with artichokes, spinach and fresh tomatoes with a dash of feta cheese. Can't beat it.  The downside is sometimes the wait on a Friday or a Saturday can be a bit long. Amel's has a nice bar offering bottled craft beers plus your standards. They often also have a lot of seasonal beers and a large wine selection.  One thing I do not care for at Amel's is their gyro. It doesn't come off of a vertical rotisserie that I'm aware of. It's good, but there are better. Order from the special menu or standard menu unless you absolutely have to have a gyro.",

The service is hilariously snarky (especially if you get one of the veteran servers) and the atmosphere is Yinzer-Chic. Their bar specials are out of this world and have a rotating schedule each week featuring gyros, burgers, wine and more. The dessert case is also delightful and none of it will destroy your bank account. Bring a group or go yourself - it's a trip to the Mediterranean via a short drive to Brookline!",
