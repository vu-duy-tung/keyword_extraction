    "text": "After a couple restaurant iterations at this location, Primanti's is an ideal fit for the space and surrounding 'hoods. The diverse crowd and continual take-out orders are healthy signs for longevity if you aren't already a convert to their \"Almost Famous\" sammies that helped put da 'burgh on the map. At happy hour with your large half-off beer, you'll be lucky to get two sips in before the larger than life sandwich appears...even before the appetizers! The service is quick and can be overly attentive depending on the server. Not a bad \"problem\" to have, really. For a bite filled with your choice o' meat, fresh cut fries, sweet 'n sour slaw, cheese + tomato you're going to have to mash down the Italian bread (and/or cut it in half), but it will be so worth it. FWIW, their pizza is actually quite good, but their wings are on the smallish side and sometimes not the greatest quality...oh and my kid is partial to their hamburger. For the real deal hunters, late night is where it's at. All the aforementioned n'at for $5 at 5 after 10:00 (time & grub vary by location). You can't tap into your inner yinzer more than breakin' bread at your local James Beard award-winning Primanti Bruthas! 4-1-2 stand up!",

    "text": "After leaving a very negative review for another Primanti's location in town, I have to say I'm quite impressed with this one. I went here one week after opening early on a Friday evening. The fries on the sandwiches were crispy and piping hot and the veggie burger seemed like it might actually be made in house? Service was speedy and friendly. Good beer selection and happy to see a full bar as well as a larger menu (items like Pizza and salads). There weren't any sports games on so the crowd wasn't very big which is a shame, because I feel like this Primanti's actually deserves the crowd. Despite being a chain of sorts, it does have a local vibe to it and I feel like it's going to do much better in this location than some of the upscale predecessors in this spot. Hopefully the service and quality holds up when they are busier too. I live nearby so I'm sure I'll be back often- excited to see what they do with the outdoor patio in the warmer months.",

There were 2 girls working, one behind bar and one on the floor. I sat down near the bar. Once the server came out on the floor, after I was sitting there a couple of minutes, she walked right by me, ignored me, and continued to walk by me a number of times not even acknowledging me. No hello, no offer of a menu, no I'll be right with you. Then the bartender came back out on the floor, walked right by me, proceeded to go behind the bar and talk to the 2 guys that were there. Never even bothered to say hello or offer a menu. I waited for at least 15 minutes and never once was acknowledged. I walked out.  I live in the area and have heard multiple bad things about this location and it's lack of service.",

The rest he forgot it on the table near us so we had to go grab it. Then it took another 20 minutes before we got our order asking people who is now our waiter. The bartender ended up taking our order. Honestly not sure if she was drunk because she seemed confused the entire time she was serving us. Our food took 45 minutes to come out and our food was cold! Then we had to wait another 20 minutes to get our check. After the waitress wrote it down, she still got our receipts incorrect. Honestly, I don't think she should be waitering. She mentioned she is a bartender. They need to staff accordingly. Last time we came to Pittsburgh we went to the Market Place location and they were amazing. This place had terrible service! I would not recommend.",

    "text": "OK, if you know me, you know I enjoy a good sammich.  And in Pittsburgh you go to Primanti's to get a good sammich.  I have been wanting to try the new location for a while, but never had an opportune time to do so until recently.  This place is not hard to miss, a bright green building is definitely something you can't miss.  I am hoping that Primanti's sticks here.  This space has gone through several businesses already and it's about time that it has a constant business inside.  The decor is kind of a mix of dark and rustic.  Black definitely plays a presence here, maybe they do that to downplay the brightness of the outside of the building.  It kind of gives you an outdoorsy type of feeling inside.  Corrugated metal lines the wall, huge windows for tons of natural light, and there is also an outdoor patio that basically continues the flow in this place.  I went with my old faithful here and got myself the Jumbo.  I am still amazed each time I see the sammich coming at me.  It's like watching happiness approach you even though you know this happiness is going to be messy.  It's a gut-punch of a sammich.  There are times you have to take part of it home with you.  With this sammich, there is no need to order a side because the sandwich contains the side.  Make your side, if you must have one, a sweet libation.  Full bar available to make your whatever your poison is.  Staff is amazing here.  They were on top of everything.  Making it a breeze of a time here.    Only downside, and for real this is the only downside, is that parking is near impossible around here.  If you come at a busy time you will have two choices, walk or either take public transit.",

Blue moon was on offer for around $4 for a large glass, there was a wonderful server who was only too happy to help with any questions I had.   Food was superb, my friends and I had boneless wings, chips & queso, and a pastrami sandwich. The two veggie options for sandwiches were great, a tuna one and a double cheese with egg sort of thing. Both looked great.  The sandwiches were served with a bunch of cheese, slaw, tomato, and fries on the sandwiches themselves  (sort of superb chip butties for you brits out there).  The pricing was more than reasonable, and people were in and out of here all afternoon. It seemed busy and we didn't deal with a bad member of staff.   For what it is, it's a great restaurant.",

We also had sangria which was very good - comes in a huge glass for only $3.25. The atmosphere is great at this new primantis location - lots of tvs and lots of people sitting at the bar having a drink. Will definitely be back!   Update: I have returned to this location multiple times as I live very close. We have had relatively good experiences here, but we're charged for celery and blue cheese with our wings. I pointed it out to the waitress who said the price shown in the menu includes the price of celery and dressing, but it's broken out on the receipt. Can't be True since 8 wings are 6.99 and I was charged 7.99. Just kind of a bummer that the staff doesn't even know what their menu says!",

You know the food is good when everybody gets quiet! I tried my brother's wings and it made me consider getting an order to go for later. If a restaurant doesn't understand when you say you want your wings \"fried hard\" then run away...to the nearest Primantis because they do and pack in the flavor too.",

My group all opted for sandwiches which come with coleslaw and fries piled high on the sandwich itself. I heard rave reviews about the pastrami, but I opted for the bacon and provalone sandwich. Yes, it's a heavy meal, but so so good! The service was speedy and the whole vibe was definitely Pittsburgh proud.

I been to many Primanti Bros. throughout Pittsburgh  in the past 20yrs. and this establishment on Penn Ave has been the most dirtiest restaurant I've been to since the dirty O ( original 's hotdog shop) in Oakland years ago.  I don't know if they were short staffed or what . One bartender and the poor waiter was running around with his head cut off like a chicken.  My fries were cold on my sandwich and did not taste right, like the meat wasn't done and to top it off my fiance ordered the Thursday pizza special and the waiter brought dirty silverware and the spatula was  dirty too, like took it from someone else and gave it to us. So he went and ask for plastic silverware and used his hands to get pizza. Well Need to said I didn't eat my sandwich and I will not be returning to this Primanti Bro ever. If this was my first time at a Primanti Bros. and didn't ever eat there food this place definitely would of turned me against the rest. It's a shame",

Pros: Great happy hour and late night specials, even on weekends. Food has always been good. Cons: The service is pretty meh. The servers have all been very friendly but they all seem brand spanking new to the service industry so they are forgetful and often painfully slow and usually unfamiliar with the menu, draft list, prices, etc. I've tried the garlic parmesan wings a couple times and they are usually very dry, but the other wing flavors have been good.

After my visit, I'd have to say I disagree.   I went with the Pittsburger since it's the their #2 best seller (SPOILER ALERT, the #1 is beer):  *The burger was good, but remind me way more of meat loaf in flavor and consistency. *The nachos with steak, taste Taco Bell-esk. *The boneless wings are average, very similar to BW3's * The Smallman St Manhattan is really good, too much ice for my liking though   Service was pretty good, but we ordered apps that ended up coming after our entrees.",

For the record, this has been hyped up for some time, and it was my first Primanti Bros experience. Honestly I thought the wings were more enjoyable than the sandwich, which was just ok.  I did appreciate that the slaw on top was vinegar based instead of mayo based, which reminded me a bit in flavor of sauerkraut, which would tie back to some German Pennsylvania roots. That aside, the sandwich otherwise was eh. It satisfied but didn't really do much to impress.",

    "text": "Can always count on Primanti Brothers for a great sandwich! We called in our order ahead of time to pick up on the way to the zoo and ate it in the car. We were hungry, so that played a role, but everything tasted great!  My wife and I split a roast beef and cheese sandwich and an order of fried pickles. We started on the fried pickles first while driving, and that was a nice preview. Would have been nice if they'd given us napkins, but fortunately, we had some in the car. They sure are tasty, though. Perfect mix of the tangy pickle and the crispy breading.  The sandwich was great as well. In retrospect, I should have asked them to cut it in half, but at the same time, it's a fairly messy sandwich, so it worked out to not both be eating a half. Taste-wise, it's a great mix of meat, cheese, slaw, and fries.  This location had a cool ambiance to it as well, though I only went in to pick up the order. Not very large, but it had open-air seating, which was nice on a temperate day.  Good sandwich at a decent price. Always glad to get Primanti Brothers whenever I'm in Pittsburgh!",

I've had these sandwiches before and am usually satisfied but today the bread was definitely old and that threw the whole experience off.  Not sure why it's so famous, I personally don't think Primantis sandwiches are a must-have at all for tourists, especially since we have other good food in the city.  With that being said, I'll prob come back and give it another shot when I'm drunk, which is usually the best time to eat here.",

Which sucks, because a beer distributer is right across the street and they're only up the street from me.  When I call my orders in (which is ALMOST always) I always get attitude, which is especially annoying because when I arrive to pickup my order it's slow. They never want to give you that extra receipt that us Primantis Bros app users scan for points, they charge for extra sauce and/or completely ignore you when it's an UberEats order, and everytime I get my favorite sandwich (the Pastrami) the meat tastes \"old\"; or overcooked, Idk I'm not a chef.  Service has been slow everytime I've sat down to eat, but I'm not the type to particularly blame the bartender/waitress; I assume the kitchen staff is slow, because the none of the sandwiches are complicated. Still, just be aware.  I'm giving two stars because the food is edible.",

Our waitress was nice (She had on a Steelers jersey that was half black and half white) but drinks took forever.  She wrote all of our orders down which did contain different wing orders, pizza and sandwiches but more than half of the orders came out wrong. At one point they kept trying to give us food that wasn't ours. I noticed one bartender that was overwhelmed and a white guy who was acting like a food runner rolling his eyes and gave us attitude.  He got annoyed with me when he brought out incorrect food...again and I said \"Don't get an attitude with me because you are making mistakes.\"   Finally they corrected the food mistakes but the night was messed up.    Food quality was good which is why they even get 2 Stars.   I would advise finding a different place to go to watch the game because you are going to wish you just stayed home and made your own food.",

    "text": "My family and I were invited to check out the newest Primanti Bros. location on Penn Avenue in Garfield as they were training their new staff. This was once the location of Verde/ Prairie. The Primanti's staff did a great job as this location looks nothing like it did previously and really feels like a Primanti Bros. now. Every bit of useable space has been used to add as many seats and tables as possible. There are also lots of big screens everywhere to help cheer on the Bucs, Pens and Steelers.  On our pass we were given a specific time to arrive which was 6pm. Once we arrived our party of four could barely fit inside as there were quite a few people ahead of us waiting to be seated. About 15 minutes later the hostess asked for our name our party size and told us that the wait would be about 20 minutes. Some people who arrived after us were seated before us because the hostess had asked them for their names before making her way to us which made our wait even longer.   By now we had been standing around for 45 minutes and still weren't seated. The reason the wait was so long was that people were finished eating and were just hanging out instead of getting up so people who were waiting could be seated. We were offered something to drink while we waited which was a nice touch.  Finally we were seated Alexander our server came to tell us about the food and take our drinks orders. The music was way too loud as we could hardly hear Alexander speak and had to repeat to each other what he had said. He was very green and should have had a seasoned server to show him the ropes first. We had to ask him to refill our daughters glass as it was empty for qit a while.  The adults at the table started off with the Drunk Duck cocktail which was amazing and helped me to quickly forget how pissed off I was with the long wait. Next we chose a bucket of the Spicy Garlic wings which were amazing once we finally got to eat them as we had to flag down another server to get some plates. The wings were nice and juicy and cooked to perfection.   For our sandwiches my wife and our friend both got the New Yorker which is Primanti's version of a New York Deli sandwich. Our daughter chose the Pitts Burger with double meat and I chose the Black Angus with double meat. I can say with confidence that these were some of the best Primanti Bros. sandwiches we have ever had.  This was this locations first day of service and thankfully for Primanti Bros. this was a test run before the official grand opening on 1/18/17. Once the waiting situation is worked out and the music is turned down I'm sure this will be one of Primanti's most popular locations.",

Hopefully you'll be lucky enough to have Jerry as your bartender. He'll take care of you and make you feel like a regular. Definitely a Pittsburgh tradition!",
