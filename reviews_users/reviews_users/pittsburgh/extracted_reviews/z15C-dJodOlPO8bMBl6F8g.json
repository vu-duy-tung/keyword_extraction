    "text": "Questions to ask yourself before going to Bar Marco...  1. Am I a hipster? 2. Do I love being crammed into a too small space with hipsters? 3. Do I like a place so pretentious that they don't have a cocktails menu but instead interview you on the flavors you like, come up with some concoction, then charge you $12 for a drink (a fact they don't mention when you order) that will literally be gone in 4 sips? 4. Is your idea of restaurant ambiance to decorate with stuff found in the dumpster behind Goodwill?   If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, then this might be the place for you. I, for one, was not impressed. I went there last night and, while the drink I had was OK, it definitely wasn't worth $12 and I am annoyed that this wasn't explained upfront. Also annoyed that the waiter spilled half my bowl of soup in my lap then didn't bring me a new bowl or even comp the soup. That's not the kind of service that inspires me to return.   As for the regular food, I can't really speak to it because they had James, owner of the Pittsburgh Taco Truck, as guest chef. His tacos are awesome so I definitely recommend catching his truck. Just get your tacos there, not Bar Marco. They'll be a cpl dollars cheaper too, because they'll be lacking the side of pretentiousness.",

    "text": "LOVED it. LOVED.  I went to Bar Marco for brunch this past Sunday & took my kids (ages 11 & 13) with me. We LOVED it. From the moment we were seated, we were well taken care of by the wait staff and our needs tended to a fare-thee-well.  The kiddos had fresh-squeezed orange juice (natch) and I had coffee (one of the coolest coffee presentations I've seen, by they way) and one of their handcrafted cocktails: the hot buttered Sazerac.  Lemme take a minute to talk about the crazy goodness of this drink. It was mellower than a traditional Sazerac, but packed all the same, smooth, magnificent punch as anything you'd find in New Orleans. But on a day when it was damp, cold, and entirely too wintry outside, this drink's warmth was just the ticket. LOVED it.  Our entrees were terrific. My daughter had Eggs Benedict which was \"on fleek\" and my son, their signature burger, which he reported was \"the noms,\" as his eyes rolled back into his head. I had cornmeal pancakes with fresh blueberry conserve (and a few slices of bacon, to boot) that were fantastic. Not too sweet; just sweet enough.  The only thing holding me back from giving the 5th star in the review here is that we were seated at the tiniest of tables (and we *did* have a reservation), so there was scarcely enough room on it for all our food.  But, hey. First world problems, right?  Bar Marco is GREAT and we'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "So far, I'd have to say Bar Marco is my top pick for grabbing some GOOD cocktails AND being able to also feed yourself with delicious food!  The main attraction at Bar Marco has got to be the cocktails.  They can make you anything.  You give them a few hints and characteristics of the types of cocktails you want and voila!  The bartender will craft a drink just for you.  My favorite so far has been a rye, vermouth, lavender, soda water drink that I got when I asked for something whiskey, but not syrupy, cinnamony or too heavy.  All the dishes at Bar Marco are on the smaller side, so again, the main attraction is the drinks.  But, a girl's got to eat and with those drinks, you should probably get a little into your stomach!  So don't expected to be stuffed to the brim, but definitely try some of their yummy dishes to go along with your drinks.  Between me and a girlfriend, we ordered 2 appetizer plates and an entree plate.  And it was the perfect amount!  The decor and atmosphere are also great at Bar Marco!  It's a small cozy space, so not ideal for groups, but perfect for dropping in with a friend or two.  Before the sun sets, the restaurant is flooded with light and has an airy lively vibe.  After the sun goes down, it gains a speakeasy electric feel.  My only complaint with the space is that it can get pretty loud in there with all the bare tiles.  But it adds to the lively ambiance.  And of course, service has always been very good.  Waiters and bartenders are all very patient as you piece together your wishes and desires for a drink!",

Unlike many tastings we have been to, this one is in a secluded area and the atmosphere is really neat. There is a Sommelier (I forget his name) but he was awesome! He did a great job describing the meal, the wine he paired with it and why he chose that wine. The table is for ten people so you may be sitting with people you don't know. However, another couple sat across from us and the table was wide enough that we could have our own conversation but still chat as a group.",

    "text": "Great food, very Poor service. I have to say that this is disappointing. I am a fan of the general atmosphere and setting of this restaurant. While well disguised now, it was once a Pittsburgh Fire Department station and later housed a well known Pittsburgh Advertising agency. I have had 2 negative experiences at Bar Marco, none involving the food. The food is near exceptional but the service taints it heavily. I visited last week with 3 co-workers / clients. Our waiter ( his name begins with a 'D' ) started out okay. Once it came time to take our 4 orders ( 4 of us ordering multiple courses ) he chose to write nothing down. When a couple of us changed our minds mid-stream he was visibly and verbally annoyed with us. I opted to ask for him to pre-package half of my entree to eliminate any temptation I might have to consume the entire high calorie plate. D protested, agitated and angrily, but when I stood firm, he relented. Again visibly and vocally annoyed. I suppose with their 'no tipping' system this is what we all might come to expect? Restaurant owners unable to incentivize their staff to treat customers courteously at all times, and wait staff that loses sight of ( or just doesn't care about ) the importance of the customer to the establishment. I have not looked at tipping as the customer footing the payroll of the staff. I saw it as a system of checks and balances that evolved to protect the customer and the proprietor while giving the staff an opportunity to make more pay by providing better service. IMHO This is one area of consumer experience that may well have done without being 're-imagined', and Bar Marco is suffering for it.  Update Feb 2018. I have gone back and given them another shot. Like I said, the atmosphere is great ( almost like a speak easy ) and the food stellar. This time we had nothing but great service and attitude from the staff. I'm hoping it is this way for everyone now. I added a star with cautious optimism. I will return again soon.",

Yes, this place is a bit overpriced with plates far too small, and the complete lack of drink menu--but I can't turn down a Tuesday night visit to this place.   That's because on Tuesdays, nearly every item on the menu is $5. I'm talking $5, amazingly crafted classic cocktails, a delicious $5 burger, and unforgettable $5 arancini. This is the best deal in town, and that's why I love the spot.  The space has a great, low key vibe, but sometimes it gets a little to dark for my liking. It's perfect for groups 4 and under, and the space have special events almost every week. The upstairs boasts a private space for wine dinners (which I've heard are great).   This place is a double edged sword for me. I can't rationalize with a $12 cocktail most nights, but you can find me most Tuesdays with a $5 cocktail enjoying the space.",

At 11:50 AM, not only had we not been seated but no one even bothered to check on us as we waited outside.  I can understand a reservation being a little late but 50 minutes is unacceptable.  Plus when we went to find the manager to check again on our table, it's like he was avoiding us.   And so we left and took our business elsewhere.  The funny thing is (from my 50 minutes of watching people get seated and served while we stood there starving) is that they appear to treat the regulars really well.  It's just the new people that they happen to ignore which makes me wonder how you expand your customer base.",

And even at half off, some of the dishes were extremely overpriced. Yes, like everyone else says, the portions are tiny. This is what we tried: -Pig Face Croquettes $13: The only dish we were impressed with. You get 3 golf-ball-sized pieces of fried goodness laying in a bed of aoili.  -Butternut Squash Soup $10: Creamy and on the thicker side, which is a texture I like, but the flavor was bland.  -Kale Salad $10: The dressing was very sour....it was like eating kale doused in lemon juice. -Smoked Eggplant $10: This was weird....room temperature eggplant topped with a very salty sauce. I can't tell what the sauce tasted like.  -Hanger Steak $23: I didn't try this but my dining partner just said, \"it's okay.\" -Gemilli Pasta $19: This was literally a small bowl of pasta tossed with a tiny bit of pesto sauce and topped with an even tinier bit of cheese. Even at half off I thought this was ridiculously priced.   The service is not at all attentive even in a non-busy restaurant. The concept here is that everyone is salaried so they do not accept gratuity, and that was clear from tonight's dining experience. Sure, they weren't rude, but it was very impersonal and half-hearted service.  We didn't get any alcoholic beverages but the cocktails other people around us were getting looked good.",

I had a very manly pink drink, which for the life of me I can't remember now, but was very good and I was assured by the staff that the color was not reflective of the actual manliness of the drink, which I happily accepted.  My wife started with a hot buttered rum.  They make their own butter, which was a nice touch, and added to the drink which was delicious.    For brunch we started with the espresso soaked dates, with ricotta, over brioche.   It was light, creamy, and awesome.  I had the fried egg, over bacon and biscuit with gravy.   I will say that I was a little disappointed on the size, I was hoping for a little bit more.  It was one egg, and the biscuit wasn't very big.   It was delicious but I wasn't quite full after.  My wife had the shrimp and grits, it was not as small a portion and was fantastic as well.    Service was great, decor was great.  Besides from a smaller entree than I would've liked it was pretty perfect.",

I've gone here a couple of times before just for drinks and have been a big fan of both the drinks and also talking to the bartenders there.   This time we came with a couple of friends from out of town and after coming in and being seated the server waited 5-10 minutes before informing us that it was No Menu Monday or asking us for our drink orders. Her attitude was also much more nonchalant with us than other customers and this really left a negative feel on the whole meal.  She gave us no suggestions even though our friends had never been there.  Food-wise they offered a Southern meal highlighting the chef from Gooski's. There was Pulled Pork, Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese and Corn on the Cob. The Pulled Pork and Mac and Cheese were good, but the Collard Greens and Corn on the Cob both seem to lack anything out of the ordinary.

    "text": "I was very hesitant going into this spot for two reasons, 1) cost, as I had heard that the staff is salaried and thus you don't tip; I figured the cost of the food would reflect that, and 2) an acquaintance had terrible service there before, according to him.  We met there for dinner with a couple. I tried to call to make a reservation for 7 but j was informed they could take us at 8. I wasn't sure it would work for our friends so I promised to call back. I tried to call back to confirm but it went to voicemail; I left a really awkward voicemail. In the meantime I found out my husband has already made reservations. I called back and left a 2nd awkward voicemail . I received a call back and took the opportunity to say nevermind and apologize for my excessive awkwardness in 2 voicemails, ha! The caller, who we found out was the manager, was incredibly sweet and patient. We joked about poor husband/wife communication and how we both were recently married... 2 weeks prior.   When we arrived, they gave us complimentary champagne to say congrats. Even though other tables were there, they made us feel like we were the only guests. They were so nice, so attentive, and had great suggestions.   The venue is small and has really quirky decorations and the best mood lighting.  The food was pricey but not anymore than any of the other restaurants we like to frequent. The food was very tasty! The only thing is that portions are exponentially smaller, but not too small. I actually prefer smaller portions , as I hate the feeling of being stuffed.  During dessert my husband asked for Porto which they did not have. Instead they brought a few aperitifs and digestives for us to sample and we got to make conversation with the staff as we sample different bitters.   Truly a great experience!",

    "text": "Around the corner from Leaf and Bean, Bar Marco delivers the best possible afterlife to one of Pittsburgh's old fire halls. This is how people built fire stations a century ago: tin ceilings, metal stairs, tile brick six feet up the wall.  Whoever renovated was kind to the kitchen staff--fully half the ground floor is devoted to food preparation, and the food can tell. I ordered lemon buttermilk pancakes with sweet cream, bacon and rhubarb compote. The pancakes were light and hot with crispy edges. I didn't even use the maple syrup until the last bite.  Michelle had her choice of five delicious savories and settled on an unusual, delicious burger with sweet bacon, sauteed red onion and an egg. Passed over: fried chicken with rhubarb-chili sauce, croque BLT on sourdough, baked eggs with pepperonata sauce, fried zucchini benedict.  In a 2012 Pittsburgh Magazine review, Valentina raved about their bar program, with bitters, tinctures, juices and syrups made from scratch. We didn't scratch the surface of their drink menu, but there was nothing wrong with the gently spicy Tito's Bloody Mary or the glowing mimosa.  Total bill under $60. (Elise told us they \"do not accept any kind of gratuities.\") Writing a food review on one's phone over a rainy Saturday morning brunch: priceless.   (I paid with Discover.)",

    "text": "I realized that I hadn't gotten around to updating this review! To be fair, the first time I went to Bar Marco was when it had just opened. Hopefully you'd expect a biz to grow in time, and I really feel like they've hit their stride.  Bar Marco is not just a bar. It's a restaurant. It's an art gallery. It's an event space. It's a creative space. It's really become so many things. And you'd think by being so many different things you wouldn't find your identity, but I think they've done a good job of cultivating a community rather than just a bar.   But... just a bar they're doing quite fine! I love their creative cocktails. They always have expert bartenders at the helm. I'm a big fan of the infusion drinks, but also enjoy a classic one like the Aviation. And, if you sit at the bar, you may be lucky enough to try a taste of something they've just created!   Their brunch is super tasty. I very much enjoyed my ricotta orange pancakes. I mean, like really enjoyed. To the point that I desperately wanted more. I do warn you, this is not a \"stuff yourself silly\" brunch, but a regular sized portion. So if you're looking for a buffet style meal, you may want to go elsewhere. But if you're looking for flavor and taste, this is your jam!   I also love the concept of No Menu Mondays, where they bring in a guest chef to cook the dinner. It's usually tied with a charity that will benefit by the sales. It's just an amazing concept, because again, it's cultivating a community. I love to see restaurants getting along with other restaurants. More power to collaborating rather than being against!   Writing this just makes me want a cocktail right now... see you at the bar!",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place. I raved about it to other people without even coming here first all due to the fact they don't accept gratuity. In America, this is extraordinary. All the servers here are salaried, get paid vacation days, sick days, holidays and insurance. Wow. This is a model I will always promote.   Service was good but not exceptional. I got a newer server so he was timid and not overly knowledgeable. After reading the reviews here, I was expecting my cocktail to be grand, but it was...all right. I asked for fruit to be in the drink and that did not happen. Also, I thought my glass would be bigger than half a cup. And what free wine tastings are people talking about?! I did not see any of that!   The food tasted delicious. The prices are exorbitant. The selection is tiny--like 5 entrees to choose from and 3 of them are vegetarian :(. I had the soft shell crab and it was magnificent, but was hungry immediately afterwards. My plate was the size of a large teacup saucer and the crab itself was the size of 2 ping pong balls. Seriously, I was embarrassed for the establishment when they served that thing. So...portions are a laughable size and if I hadn't come during the happy hour time, it would have cost me $21. Dang.   It's super hip that Bar Marco refurbished a fire engine building, but could they have at least put up a sign that visibly said BAR MARCO? We drove past 3x before checking google maps again.   In summary, all the stars are for the concept of this restaurant and how servers are FTEs here. Food is tasty but you'll have to order the entire menu to be full. Go during happy hour.",

    "text": "I came here during restaurant week and wow it was amazing.   Our appetizer was a 20-yolk pasta with oxtail ragu. The ragu was beefy, rich, and flavorful. What I really liked about it was the pasta. 20-yolk sounds kind of intimidating in an omg-my-cholesterol way but it's definitely worth it. It tasted very freshly made and perfect al dente texture.   Our main course was Roast Quail. It pretty much tastes like chicken except maybe juicer and tender. The skin was crispy and overall it was seasoned very flavorfully.  Our dessert was an Apple and Raisin Strudel with Goat Cheese Balsamic Ice cream. I didn't care for the ice cream since I don't like the flavor of goat cheese, but the strudel was a perfect end to the meal. It was the perfect amount of sweet with a flaky crust.  Everything dish was paired up with a wine recommended by our waiter.   After we ate, the manager invited us to their upstairs lounge for some free wine tasting. Overall, the food was amazing. I just wish they gave them in larger portions. For paying $30, I expected to be full, but I was still hungry after the meal. Although the friendly and knowledgeable staff and great tasting food made it all worth it.",

    "text": "We had our first official meeting of the minds and stomachs here as Laura chose Bar Marco as the destination for our monthly PGH Brunch Club gathering.  It was a nice sunny but chilly Sunday afternoon and we were seated right near the entrance to this quaint eatery.  There was a good bit of natural light coming through the windows but unfortunately ever time the doors opened we received a reminder of how chilly this November day was.  So chilly we had left our coats on for a majority of the meal.  They did try to counterbalance the effect with drapes that semi-covered the entrance but it was still a little uncomfortable.    We started with drinks.  I ordered a bloody Mary while Matt had a Mimosa.  The bloody was very tasty, nice horseradish flavor with the right amount of pepper and spice.  I especially appreciated the toppings of olives, cheese, and meat.  I was a little disappointed that the second one I ordered didn't include the meat...sigh.  After viewing the brunch menu I decided on the Pork Belly.  This dish came with one sunny side up egg, and a bed of black rice underneath.  Matt chose the rigatoni that came with prosciutto, cipollini and sage.  Our wait was short and out came our dishes.  The pork belly was wonderful, savory, crispy, fattening little slab.  The egg was prepared nicely and was a great balance to the rest of the dish.  My husband also enjoyed his rigatoni.  Unfortunately, I think the size of our entrees VS the cost was a complete miss.  Good, oh yes very, very good!  This is the reason for the rating.  Flavor profile was excellent, but for $16.00 a plate I was expecting a bigger ration.  Both plates should have sold for closer to $10.00.  Poor Matt, his portion was tiny.  It was really just a cup to a cup and half of noodles.  Noodles!  The cheapest thing around and that was his portion.  He was still quite hungry after we left...sad face...  Our server was nice and overall relatively attentive.  I very much enjoyed the space and do want to try them again.  Maybe for happy hour, I hear they have pretty good deals on Tuesdays!",

Had two of the best drinks I've had in a long time. Food was phenomenal. I had the squash gnudi and the husband had the strip steak.

The bartender looked thoughtful for a moment and said, \"You should start with the Pork Loin appetizer and have the steak for your main course.\"  Needless to say, I was surprised.  In the new wave of Pittsburgh restaurants I have come to expect \"an air\" to my blue collar roots, and receive it at some places.  I did not here and   I ended up having the pork loin main course because the pork loin appetizer was mouth watering.  All of my food was delicious.  My drinks were delicious.

I think you could probably request a menu item to be in the family style offerings but I'm not sure. I love that the bartender makes cocktails based on your likes- it makes it a fun surprise! Mine was delicious. Highlights of the meal were: mushroom risotto and stuffed chicken breast with polenta. The swordfish and the meatballs were underwhelming. Our waiter was also very wonderful! We were too stuffed for dessert but they sounded awesome.",

While they may be known for their amazing cocktail and spirit selection (yamazaki, carpano antica, fernet branch, amaris peychaud's bitters, and a great  variety of scotch), equally worthwhile is their menu, particularly their small plates. Arancini and bacon-wrapped dates are standouts, as is the local Crested Duck charcuterie and regional cheese selection. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I went to Bar Marco this past weekend with a few friends and boy did we find a gem in Pittsburgh.  This new spot has everything I look for in an ideal restaurant.  For starters it is extremely cozy, not in a cramped I can't get to the bar south-side sort of way, instead the owners welcome you to the bar, discuss wine/drink options and make you feel at home.  The food is OUTSTANDING!  I can't say in all my years of being a very serious carnivore have I been able to find a rib-eye so marvelously seasoned and beautifully cooked.  Not to mention, it was enormous.   As their menu rotates, I can only hope to catch another one in the near future.  The snacks were delicious too, my favorite being the sausage and polenta, with the meatballs as a close second.   This is one of those places you should go and enjoy slowly; a little bubbly, a yummy snack, followed by a good glass of wine and maybe an entree to share.    The only downside was it was a little chilly, but then again it was January in Pittsburgh.  Simply said, come fully clothed and you will be fine.    I hear there is a patio to come....... Could be the perfect summer's night spot!",

    "text": "Some time has passed since my previous review of Bar Marco, so I thought it was worth updating. My previous enthusiasm for Bar Marco remains in place; in fact, I'd say I'm even more excited about this fine little bar/restaurant now than I was last time. Bar Marco is a unique option in Pittsburgh's increasingly sophisticated and diverse food and drink landscape. Put simply, it is great and the guys should keep up the great work they are doing. This is fast-becoming a happening joint that I suspect isn't just for the neighborhood (there can't be that many people living in the Strip, and Cioppino's bar still seems packed on Friday and Saturday evenings with the older set from the Cork Factory). People are coming from other neighborhoods, which is a good sign.  I've dedicated myself to a very rigorous review process of Bar Marco. That has meant going on an almost weekly basis at various times of the day and night (and, one time, twice on one day). This grueling (but rigorous) approach means that I have tried most of the drinks, most of the dishes, and seen the place in various \"moods\" depending on the day of the week and the time of day or night. I like all the food and all the drinks. But maybe I'm easy to please.   What's impressive about Bar Marco is that they have managed to create a friendly, welcoming environment that can also be a hot spot on busy Friday and Saturday (late) nights. Under those conditions Bar Marco becomes a very cool bar filled to capacity with \"Pittsters\" (Pittsburgh hipsters) and beautiful people (but in a good way).  It is a very happening (and loud--also in a good way) room. Creating a vibe that can be cutting edge while remaining friendly and neighborhoodly requires some skill and effort, and reminds me of places in cities like New York and Paris that morph into various states of existence and moods throughout the course of the day or, in Bar Marco's case, evening. In conducting my rigorous research for this review I planted myself for many hours to observe how the mood changes from early evening (relaxed, after-work drinks and snacking, mostly) to late evening (the aforementioned sophisticated and \"happening\" bar vibe). I've also observed it at weekend brunch (relaxed), into the afternoon (still relaxed) and then evening (see above).  It should also be noted that Bar Marco seems to be learning as they go and evolving their menu and service. If you went a while ago in their earlier days, I highly recommend a revisit. In fact, why not try something akin to my clearly scientifically rigorous sampling of this fine establishment at different times to see for yourself how it transforms with the day and time, as well as the people enjoying themselves.",

It is not possible that this restaurant enjoys the reviews that you see elsewhere on this page if our experience was typical.  The food was good, but not noteworthy. Clearly, not worth the money.  I respect the pricing structure that supports (I hope) a living wage for the staff.  But if this were a traditional restaurant in which gratuities reflected the quality of service, the staff would have been in trouble the night that we were there.  For example, our drink order never was sorted out and our waiter apologized several times for other errors. While I appreciate the good manners, a customer should never have to track down the waiter for service or to remind the server of an order.  The $$ rating is misleading.  Perhaps it was just an off night, but we won't go back to test our luck.  There are too many quality restaurants to enjoy.",

The best part of the meal was a goat cheese and balsamic ice cream which i was nervous to try but was actually mind blowing. As it was Restaurant Week the place which is fairly small was very packed but the staff was incredibly social and very helpful in describing all of the food and wine pairings. On top of all of this I got 3 orders and three drink pairings for $30 which was incredible.  I cannot speak highly enough of my all around experience here.",

    "text": "I'm currently on a two week exploration into restaurants and bars that are new to me, and I keep finding great spots and Bar Marco is a place that I will find myself frequenting.  As someone's review mentioned, the space is a work in progress, but it currently has a industrial style feel to it that I love.  Polished concrete floors, stainless steel bar, unique light fixtures, and glazed brick walls that you cannot find in a newly constructed space.  After a fairly good meal at Andrew's Steakhouse in Rivers Casino (and paying for the meal by playing Roulette after), the idea came into my head to head to Bar Marco after reading a few of the reviews on Yelp, and missing Embers and Fire House Lounge.  The Bar is owned by four friends, that you can tell are having fun with what they do.  We weren't there to eat, but to have a few cocktails, and so I ordered a Perfect Manhattan and told the bartender (Bobby) to use which ever bourbon he preferred.  He instead talked me into having their Bar Marco Manhattan, and gave me the story behind his creation which was based on recreating some famous turn of the century mixologist, but didn't have exactly what the receipt called for so heused what was on hand and came up with the Bar Marco Manhattan.  This was very tasty so for rounds two and three he was given the right to decide what I wanted to drink, which was apparently the Gimblet, and the 'treuse.  The ice melted too fast for the Gimblet because the first few sips were watery, but half way thru it was excellent.  Especially with the red pepper garnish.  The 'treuse was also excellent, and with rosemary incorporated into it it became really exceptional.  As I mentioned we weren't there to eat, but I kept eyeing everyone's food.  And the owner's kept giving me food to try, and I must say it was very good.  Especially the duck...actually I think everything I tried was duck (it must have been the theme of the night)  The atmosphere was great, the drinks were great, but the friendliness and passion of the staff is what will bring me back again.  The one thing that they need for the winter is a way to keep the draft out as the door opens.",

    "text": "I visited Bar Marco this past week and I have to say I was genuinely impressed. I want to touch on  a few of the things that really stood out to me, and which I felt justified the 5 star rating.  Ambiance - Bar Marco sells itself as a bar/restaurant/art gallery/(soon to be) cigar lounge. At first hearing this I was skeptical that it could manage all of these personas at once, but the delivery is fantastic. For the art: surrounding the bar and dining area there are works by local artists, the entire upper floor is an art gallery, and they're constantly rotating in new pieces to keep it fresh. The bar is handmade by the owners of the restaurant, and it's truly a very nice piece of carpentry. If you have an eye for aesthetics and like to soak in some culture while you eat, this is the place.  Food - While their menu is limited, it's justified in its brevity. Most of the dishes Bar Marco serves are hors d'oeuvre sized, and are great for sharing with a group. This adds to the lively atmosphere in that you're not solely engaged in your one dish, you're constantly passing around the medley of interesting and delicious dishes to sample and enjoy. It can be a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Service - When I visited; I was with a group of 10 other college students. From experience, groups such as this are usually served last as they are stereotyped as being rowdy and cheap. We did not experience this at Bar Marco. We were served very quickly, the food and drinks kept coming, and multiple waiters ensured that we were being treated well. At no point did it appear to me that other diners were being neglected; everyone seemed very pleased with their meals.   All in all, Bar Marco is a great place for dinner and drinks if you're looking for something a bit classier than what you'd usually expect in Pittsburgh. The crowd is very diverse, and the restaurant would appeal to anyone who enjoys fine dining in a casual setting. I anticipate returning frequently during the rest of my time studying in Pittsburgh.",

It is evident that the quality of the food is important at Bar Marco, and the flavor was amazing.  Only downside was that it was so good I wanted more (they don't serve the traditional Pittsburgh portions...so you won't leave feeling stuffed) but rather it just means I'll have to come back again...and definitely try out one of the brunch cocktails, they looked amazing.  Great atmosphere for a Sunday morning brunch in the strip if you want good food, smaller portions, and don't want to stand in a line for an hour :)",

    "text": "I don't understand the hype about this place. My husband and I went to an event in the upstairs part of Bar Marco which apparently serves as an art gallery by day. The art is a bit abstract for my taste but to each his own. One thing that did strike us is the fact that the room was completely unfinished. I remember the upstairs bar when this place was the Firehouse. Wasn't really my taste back then as well but at least it was finished. Right now, it looks like they have ripped everything out of the room except the beat up bar and the \"art\" on the walls. I have no idea why they would host a party in a room like that, I guess they needed the money and the company was willing to pay. The bathrooms are also a mess with one huge sink that looks like it has been used by the artists. There was splattered paint everywhere. When we first arrived, the downstairs was almost competely empty but by the time we left, it was packed.   As for food and drinks, Bar Marco seems to go out of the way to have some interesting and eclectic offerings. The bartender for the event dreamed up a cocktail for us which included rum, rose water, mint and a few other ingredients. The crowd seemed to really enjoy it though I stuck with a basic white wine. I'm boring, I know. For appetizers, we had a nice range of foods including a meat and cheese board with beef and lamb, meatballs, beans and greens and my  personal favorite, dates wrapped in bacon (love the sweet and salty aspect). For the entrees we were served short rib over what I assume was polenta and a vegetarian risotto. The rib was tender, juicy and delicious. All dishes were served family style which didn't work out to well for my end of the table where all the big eaters sat. Other tables had entire plates of food that were untouched. It also seemed to take quite awhile between courses. I'm talking like half an hour for entrees and at least that long until dessert. Up until this point, I thought that the decor and ambience were severely lacking but at least the food made up for it. Then they brought out the dessert. Two chocolate cakes with different types of buttercream icing. unfortunately the servers could not tell me what was on either of them. To me, it resembled a basic, single layer chocolate cake with  buttercream icing one having cut up cherries on top and the other golden raisins. It was a big dissappointment.  In the end, despite some the tasty and interesting food, I doubt I will be back to Bar Marco. There are so many other great restaurants in pittsburgh without all of the inconsistency.",

The drinks made the wait bearable but the mixed drinks were over priced and coffees were not refilled with out chasing down a waiter. Once we were sat we never we asked if we wanted new drinks.

Dom the sommelier is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about wine and the environment in which the grapes are grown. His excitement for his work is contagious and palpable. The food and wine pairings were delicious and perfect. The food was cooked to perfection. I don't usually enjoy scallops, but these were SO delicious. The olive oil cake was also phenomenal. Bar Marco makes all pastas in-house, so it's no wonder that the orecchiette with broccoli and parmigiano was so good. I could have eaten just that and been so happy (though I am thrilled with the variety!). I can't leave out the hanger steak - it was a locally raised cow (can't remember the farm) but it was served rare and delicious and had a juniper crust. Farro gran arso (and the history behind the dish) also gets me every time, so I was happy to have it on my plate. Their take on a salsa verde was parsley-heavy with clear lemony flavor, the freshest accompaniment to a steak that I've ever had. Speaking of local, the salad components (aside from the cheese) came from Who Cooks For You Farm. I always applaud locally-sourced ingredients. I haven't left a restaurant excitedly anticipating my next visit in a long time, but I'm already itching to come back to Bar Marco!",

The brunch caesar salad was crunchy and flavorful, and the chicken milanese was filling and tasty. We had a reservation and sat at the bar, which was fun because we got to chat with the servers who were mixing cocktails. The food was also reasonably priced for an upscale restaurant, and I was excited to hear that all Bar Marco employees are salaried and no tips are accepted. The service was excellent, and hopefully more restaurants in the area will pick up on this trend. The only criticism I'd have is that the Bloody Mary was slightly watery--opt for the delicious mimosa instead.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to hit up the brunch at Bar Marco for quite some time now, so I was thrilled when I finally got a chance to try out their dinner menu at happy hour a couple days ago.  My boyfriend and I were extremely impressed with the atmosphere. Bar Marco is housed in a large old firehouse, and they preserved a lot of the original architecture of the building such as the white subway tiles on the walls. The area where the garage doors used to be has been replaced by a couple of beautiful large windows. This space feels extremely hip and upscale. It's also just the right size; there are not too many tables, so it feels exclusive but not in a pretentious way. Bar Marco has an upstairs that is used for private parties and events. I'm already thinking about trying to convince my office to host their next holiday party at this location!  We started with cocktails, which are only $6 during happy hour (awesome!). Bar Marco does not have a cocktail menu; you simply share a few things that you like with your waiter, and the bartender whips up his own concoction for you. I absolutely LOVED our cocktail experience. I can see how some people may not like the fact that they can't examine a cocktail menu, but as a personally adventurous eater/drinker, I had so much fun with the \"surprise\" aspect of this. My boyfriend mentioned that he was into Moscow Mules, so he received Bar Marco's own version (the \"Marco Mule\") which was extremely refreshing and delicious. I asked for a drink made with white rum and mentioned that I like fruit juices. My cocktail was to die for! It included white rum, a muddled lime juice made in-house, and a dark blackberry nectar also made in-house. It was phenomenal and I'm still thinking about it!  We shared a couple of different dishes for dinner. The entire dinner menu is half-price during happy hour, which is a huge bonus. I would say that the dishes here are a bit small for the price, but if you come during happy hour I think it's worth it. To start, we ordered the house-made focaccia bread and the pork belly bites. The bread was absolutely delicious. You could really taste the rosemary infused into the bread, and the olive oil it came with was great as well. The pork belly bites were in a sweet and tangy sauce, and were totally addictive. The one negative to the pork belly bites is that they did seem to have a lot of fat on them, and we would have preferred a little more meat since the plate was already so small to begin with. Nevertheless, we still gobbled them up. Finally, we shared the rigatoni, which comes on a bed of beef shank. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and the flavors were wonderful. We were worried that we wouldn't have enough food, but we were actually quite full at the end of our meal.  Bar Marco is definitely a must-try in the Strip, and I can't wait to come back and try the brunch that I've been hearing so much about. Yes, it is pricey, but I don't mind paying a little more for food that I know is delicious and high quality. Additionally, the fact that the staff is on salary is awesome and I really appreciate the business model. Great work, Bar Marco!",

    "text": "This is a review for the wine room. Went here for my boyfriend's birthday. The wine room serves a prix fixe 5 to 6 course menu every Saturday for a three hour dinner with two seatings, one at 5pm and one at 8pm. Limited strays are available so it's best to reserve in advance.  The good: -Each dish was very tasty and beautifully plated -$130ish per person includes wine pairings with every dish and unlimited refills. also no tip needed -new menu each week so you could do it multiple times. Also, guest chefs prepare the meal sometimes  -you can tell them any dietary restrictions ahead of time and they will accommodate  -wonderful service   The bad: -the room is a wine cellar, so it's cold. Nicely decorated but you are still in a basement.  -it was one long table with 4 couples seated together. This kind of killed the romantic/intimate vibe, although we got to meet some nice folks -I walked away hungry! The plates, including our duck breast main dish, were too small. Perhaps it's because we had a guest chef, this might not be the case every week  -the wines were ok, not great. They source organic wines so that might limit their selection. Some were way too sweet -they asked if we wanted cocktails to begin our meals when we were first seated. I should have realized they weren't part of the price, but for some reason I thought they were. So an additional $22 for two drinks to my bill at the end hurt...  Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was nice, but for the price I think Isabella's and Altius provided better meals.",

She was able to mix whatever combination was asked for, and she was very attentive to detail. She even wrote down the recipe for a cocktail that I loved! Who does that?!  We ordered the pork and beef meatballs that came on a bed of grits and capers with a tangy tomato sauce. Yum!  Also split the espresso burger with rosemary aioli and the potatoes with hollandaise sauce. Everything was rich and filling, and all three of us were satisfied at the conclusion of the brunch.

    "text": "We've dined and drank here many times, and it's unfortunate that it takes a bad experience for me to leave a review. I know I've had both brunch and dinner here happily... but tonight was really disappointing.  1. No drink menu. Okay, fine, I get it... your bartenders are not only magical mixologists, but they're also mind readers. I am perfectly fine with a bar tender offering to make something for you, but to be so pretentious as to not even offer a menu of even fancy-pants cocktails - whatever. I literally had to say no to the bartender about four times before he'd stop explaining how I could order a drink from him. I felt like I was in high school again trying to turn down a cigarette. Seriously man, if you want me to order a drink so badly, HAND ME A FREAKING MENU.   2. Beef tartare instead of a burger. I've ordered these before, and I don't think it was even cooked through last time either. I probably ordered it medium rare in the past, so I went for medium this time. Neither of these cooking temperatures should leave the center of the burger as if they're raw or like heat never even reached it. But, alas, even ordering the burger medium left the center raw. We were too tired, hot, and hungry to send them back.  3. I actually WANTED to order the rib eye, but was told it was out (it was only around 8:45 at this point - really?! You're out of one of 3 entrees already?). Then, probably just a couple minutes after ordering the burger instead, I heard another waiter come out and let his table know they actually did have a couple of rib eyes left. UGH. SO annoying. You either ARE or ARE NOT out of something. Please don't guess when your menu is that small to begin with.  4. Get on Open Table. It's 2014.",

It was close your eyes and savor delicious. The chocolate torte was great and light and flavorful.

    "text": "Prior to the Candlebox (hey, I'd have rather seen Candlemass, but Kay likes em...) concert at Altar Bar Friday night , we stopped into Bar Marco for a quick and light meal. This building of crimson brick with its chalk-inscribed logo has interested me for some time. I even planned to stop in before another concert night, but alas, it was a Monday, and they were closed.  On this ideal end-of-the-week summer evening, Bar Marco was jumping with an eclectic clientele that included young bucks, old folks, hipsters, and goobers alike.   The interiors are almost sepulchral, gothic. The lighting deliberately makes it seem as if you are viewing everything through lenses washed with red wine...or blood. In spite of Bar Marco's fairly creepy atmosphere, we found that the staff and  patrons were welcoming.   I didn't want much, so I went with the Duck BLT. Kay just wanted something sweet, so she treated herself to a rhubarb cobbler that was daringly topped with Ricotta cheese rather than whipped cream or ice cream. When one of the employees saw Kay's light blue Terminator t-shirt that read \"SARAH CONNOR IS MY HOMEGIRL,\" he instantly concocted for her a drink that was coincidentally called \"The Homegirl,\" which Bar Marco had just invented very recently. It contained a mint leaf, and according to Kay was ALL rum, leaving her with a healthy buzz.   My aversion to rhubarb has ended completely thanks to BM's cobbler. The rhubarb was tart enough to make me pay attention but not so tart that I was puckering my lips like a character from a vintage Warner Brothers cartoon, and the ingenious addition of the mild Ricotta turned the cobbler into something that approached cheesecake.  The Duck BLT was akin to a brilliant opening act as I was left wanting more. The bread resembled an English muffin with its crunchy texture and buttery cavities. Mayonnaise was involved along with arugala, and of course the sandwich's reason to be: the slithery, lardy, slender cuts of duck.   And this brings me to one caveat I had about Bar Marco: the portions! For $9, I expected a serving that was adequate, substantial. Had I not savored the halved sandwich, I could have consumed it in two bites without difficulty.   What was our total for a glass of ginger ale, and the aforementioned cobbler, sandwich, and mixed drink?  Almost $30!   So while I am tempted to knock off two stars, the food and service were splendid enough that I'll only deduct one. BM either needs to reconsider its rations, its prices, or both, but in the face of all of that, they are a business that I feel is worth watching and revisiting. That BM wasn't a rowdy cesspool at 10:00 PM on a warm Friday in the party-centric Strip District is enough to recommend it. I was comfortable here, and as someone who avoids bars, that alone should serve as sufficient credit for Bar Marco.",

Walking through the Strip in the afternoon a few of the bartenders outside on a break struck up a conversation with my group. They invited us in, made us some cocktails, explained a lot of the process behind making up their drink menu, and generally were a bunch of cool guys and girls. Little did we know they were technically closed from 3-5pm between brunch and dinner. We thanked them, settled up and promised to return soon.  We returned, not eight hours later, around 11:30pm, but they serve food until last call at 2am. The same bartenders were working and were just as friendly and professional even though it was much busier, being prime late night. Everything we had was great, they were able to recommend drinks based on what we liked prior and generally know their stuff.

    "text": "I love a place that consistently surprises me, yet is consistent with getting the basics right. Bar Marco has that: lots of variety, but always excellent service and wonderful cocktails.  I've only been for brunch and rounds so far (dying to check out No Menu Monday but just haven't made it in yet), but each time has been great. The servers and bartenders are just top-notch. The bartenders are pros at the 'tell us what you like and we'll make a cocktail out of it' game. And this is a spot where the bar and the restaurant are truly two parts of the same whole: the servers are knowledgeable about the drinks too.  I think what I love so much is that Bar Marco is simple and yet exciting. Your brunch order may just be eggs and country potatoes, but the eggs will be dressed up in fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor. They don't have a massive selection of booze behind the bar, but they can make pretty much anything you can dream up, and make it really well.  While they do have a nifty little cocktail list, the sky is really the limit. This is one of my favorite places to order a Blood & Sand, a drink at the top of my list. Their brunch cocktails are fabulous as well and very refreshing in the morning!  As long as Bar Marco keeps serving up  great scotch cocktails and friendly service, I'll keep stopping in.",

    "text": "I know that great things are in store for Bar Marco...it's just not there yet, in my opinion.  First, let me say that the guys who own/run the joint are SO  very nice and it pains me a little to give it a 2-star review.  But I look forward to the future at Bar Marco and will absolutely update this review accordingly.    I visited yesterday with my Sunday Brunch Club.  Our group of 10 arrived promptly at 12:30pm.  We all agreed that it was actually a bit tough to find. We'd all been to Firehouse previously, but without a [visible] sign, we all did respective double-takes to make sure we were in the right spot. Upon entering, we were greeted with...um...two big grey curtains? I'm not sure how else to describe it. I suspect the curtains were in place to keep out the cool Pittsburgh chill; but nonetheless, it again felt like we might be in the wrong place.  Good news though - we were in the right place and sat down immediately!   Unfortunately, it was quite a while before we had drinks in-hand. And actually, only some of us were given waters, as they were waiting for more glasses to be washed.  Rather than go on and on about the various wait times, just know that we had to wait quite awhile in between most parts of the meal - waters to drinks; drinks to meals; etc.  Two entrees out of the smallish menu were sold out.  After visiting and realizing what a bare bones establishment the place is, I understand that this is probably likely on a Sunday morning/afternoon. I think a warning on the website and/or Facebook page may be helpful to first-timers.  When you have your heart set on something and it isn't available it's just so sad, right?    Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, but for the most part, felt it was just a teensy weensy bit overpriced and too loud. I know - we sound like a bunch of old ladies (we're not and old ladies are awesome), but it's True.  I say pull those great curtains onto the walls and work some acoustical magic on the some-day-will-be-charming room that is Bar Marco.",

If you go in the afternoon their drink menu is very good, as I went with a party of four and tried a bit of everything, but the bartender wasn't very good and couldn't really go off menu. At dinner though you can pretty much make up your own drink based on the type of liquor and the taste that you want, +A bar for sure. The food was also really good, I got the rigatoni and my girlfriend got the octopus (she still thinks about it 5 months later), but the bar is what really makes this place stick out.",

We've been wanting to try Bar Marco's food for quite some time after stopping for drinks on multiple occasions...  fast forward, and Polar Vortex $5 happy hours, brunch, and a wine room excursion are all booked (brunch and wine room will be updated soon!).  Let me sum it up in short.  Normally, I feel Marco is a bit overpriced.  Is it good...?  yes.  Are the drinks worth $12 and the small bites for $10+...? no.  BUT, add in the Tuesday special, and this is one of the best deals in town.  $5 drinks (I recommend the Manhattan), $5 bar bites (if you don't get the burger you're crazy) and $5 other delicious goods (bacon wrapped dates, soup and arancini).  Do yourself a favor and grab a reservation just in case they're busy (it can fluctuate week to week).  Then drink, eat and repeat...  that simple.  While it's pricey, judging by our initial food experience, I'm excited to see what brunch holds and more importantly, the wine room!  Updates soon!",

I particularly enjoyed the glassware and the artistry behind a few of the plate presentations.  The wine!  Stuff I've never heard of (and I experienced a lot of different wines;) mostly whites, I generally prefer red but did not mind at all because they were fantastic. A definite theme in the wine and the food was local, farm raised, unique greens and flavors, very considerate of vegetarian and allergen concerns. One of the best pairing successes of wine and food equally enhancing each other. There were countless (ok, about 12) pairings.  The food was lovely. Very small but many tasting portions, I would have difficulty picking a favorite.",

Jamilka Borges was part of the success of this restaurant, so I was uncertain what would happen when she left.    Well the food remains great, remains creative and delicious.  2. I love the \"no tipping\" policy, for a number of reasons.  I get excellent service, but I also know that servers get a fair shake.  Servers are friendly, helpful, and very thoughtful.  3. Their wine list is wonderful.  It's not your typical wine list, and on Tuesday nights, for example, I can get an $8 wine glass special.  4. When everything else is closed...Bar Marco is usually open.  11 pm on weekdays is awesome, especially if I am leaving another event.   But what it comes down to, is that I am consistently wowed by the food.",

Brunch is served between 10 - 3 on Saturdays and Sundays. I do recommend making reservations given that it is a pretty tiny restaurant. The menu is always changing based on the season, so if you see something you want to try get there before it's gone. One thing to note is they have a parking lot right next door specifically for Bar Marco guests. No need to worry about finding a parking spot in the busy daytime rush in the Strip District.  I ordered the Lemon Buttermilk Pancakes with ricotta & peaches. There were 3 pancakes and sadly they were pretty tiny. The pancakes came with 2 strips of bacon (brown sugar and cardamom). The bacon was cooked to perfection! You can tell just by the taste they only cook with the finest ingredients. I was very happy with my brunch selection, I just wish there was more to it (I go hard on brunch). This would be a great date night spot if you are not looking to drive into the city but still want that city dining experience.   Also - service members do not accept gratuity. That being said, we still received exceptional service.",

    "text": "4.5 stars   Bar Marco is housed in an amazing restored and repurposed building in the strip.  It's a bit easy to bypass it when driving because the building is a gorgeous red brick building with the sign \"No 7 Engine Company\".    I came here for Saturday brunch. When you walk around in the strip seeing all the great food, you have to wonder if a sit down worth it?  I will tell you that YES, Bar Marco food is incredible and definitely worth it!  The same restored and yet authentic aged distress look is also inside.  The dining area is not very big... maybe 20 tables.  There's a great chandelier and really interesting art work.  Overall, just a great casual and hip vibe to the place.  As mentioned there isnt a lot of tables. When 10:30 am came around, it was fully packed and had to turn people away.  I totally recommend reservations or come at 10 am to not be disappointed.    One cool and interesting thing about this restaurant... they don't allow tips. The restaurant is paying a living wage for everyone on staff and its just another reason to come here and support them... I think that's amazing.  Service here is helpful and relaxed... perhaps a bit too relaxed in terms of pick up dishes or the bill ready to be processed.  But in terms of friendliness and filling water glasses, you can't ask for better.    The brunch menu is short and well curated with sweet and savoury options.  We were very tempted to order a donut for the table but the brunch entrees here are quite substantial so we didn't have any room!  Another thing about the menu, we were told they rotated the items a lot and it follows whatever is in season.  The staff here knows whats best and their recommendation of the baked eggs were perfect.  Baked Eggs - 3 cracked eggs were cradled and baked in a tomato and pepper sauce (pepperonata?) with a healthy dose of parmigiana cheese to give it a nice savoury sharp and slightly nutty note.  The eggs yolks still molten and cutting into them allowed them to ooze into the sauce.  I used the bread to help sop up every bit.  I would have loved a bit more heat or perhaps another herb.  Excellent brunch dish 4/5  Tiramisu French Toast - A generous plating of the best French toast we had in the city.  Curiously, the flavour note may have given someone pause on ordering but once it was tasted, I'm pretty sure eyes were closed and the sounds of 'mmmm' were only heard.  I only got a small piece... that should tell you how good it was.  The custard filled every nook and cranny and had a really nice subtle coffee flavour to not overwhelm the entire dish.  The mascapone cheese was rich and was a much better flavour to the usual sweetened whip cream you see in other places.  I really liked how they had these cute small white chip looking meringues.  A cute detail!   5/5  If I had more time, i would have definitely returned for dinner.  I loved the atmosphere, friendly service, and the amazing food.  Definitely one of the best restaurants we tried in the city!",

We had a few appetizers: the lentil soup with meatballs which was interesting and tasted good. The pork tonnato which come with a tuna mousse (almost like a mousse) which my husband loved, it's just not my thing. The rigatoni amatriciana was amazing! Simple but so perfectly executed with beautiful flavor. We then shared the steak dish which was cooked perfectly and very tasteful. We finished with a delicious desert which was a polenta crust tart with chocolate mousse. It wasn't very sweet, which I love in a dessert and it had such a unique texture ( in a great way). Can't wait to visit again!",

The happy hour menu is from 5-6 and it is one of the best deals in Pittsburgh.  We had two of the $6 cocktails an old fashioned and an aperol spritz to start and both were excellent! Started with the fried smelts with salsa verde and the meatballs but the arancini were outrageous!!  Finished with a couple of pastas, the fresh rigatoni amatriciana and the tagliolini with sausage ragu.  The house made rigatoni is $10 during happy hour ($16 on the regular menu) and just might be the best value in the entire city!!  Both were crazy good!  Service was impeccable, Karl was our server and couldn't have been more polite and attentive!!  Bravo Bar Marco, we will be back soon!!",

    "text": "I went back & forth on what to rate Bar Marco and at the end of the day, it came down to the unique and fabulous experience that I had here. Chris made reservations for Valentine's day here and I couldn't have been more excited! I always wanted to come here but never really had a reason (PSA to all couples... it was also a super romantic Valentine's day spot).   The atmosphere inside is very intimate and delightful. It is also super small- so I would definitely recommend trying to get reservations before going.  The minute I saw the interior, I knew this would be my kind of place! We were quickly greeted by our waiter (I wish I remembered his name). He was very attentive and provided spectacular service the whole night. I was so excited to order the bartender's choice drink & after describing to him what I was looking to drink- they delivered with a unique and delicious cocktail. This was probably my favorite part of the whole night!  The only downside of Bar Marco is the high price for the small portions that you receive for the food. We started with 2 appetizers, the arancini & cheese board. The arancini came with 2 servings and quickly became the best arancini that I have ever had. I would say this is a must to try here!  The cheese board was nothing special, it just had a few pieces of cheese and bread. For my meal, I decided on the bucatini carbonara, which was good, but not something I would order again & also a very small portion. Chris ordered the filet mignon that was melt in your mouth amazing- I wish I ordered that!   Looking forward to coming back for more cocktails and brunch for my next visit!",

    "text": "Ehh. So, I was here for a wedding and there wasn't any issues with the event. The food was good, nothing to rave about. We had a decent salad, very basic pasta, and pork loin that was cooked well.  Unfortunately, the group wanted to go back for brunch and it was a very disappointing experience to say the least. Our group arrived before it opened, but we were waiting for a few more people. We waited 10 minutes after 10 (opening hours) and went inside. We were told that we had to sit outside because we didn't have reservations (definitely make them as it is a small spot). The many empty tables had reservations at 11 (odd). No fret. We sat, ordered, few more came and ordered and WAITED. It took an hour for the first plates to come out. I had three cups of coffee as we were waiting and watched as people came, dined, and left. We were commenting how hungry we were.  Finally, a few plates arrive. Those who ordered the eggplant get their food first, follow by soft eggs get their food first. A friend sitting on one side of me whispered how he was glad he didn't order the eggs, seeing it arrive to hubby sitting on my other side. My orange pancakes with bacon comes next. Pancakes are very mediocre. The bacon was sticky with the glaze. Those who were waiting for crepes get their food last. It didn't make any sense. After we ate, a few of us were still hungry. One of our group members opted to get a banh mi from the stall next to the restaurant as we waited for the check (yeah, that's how dissatisfying the food was).  Worst, we were there because the bride wanted to come back. They messed up her order and gave her pancakes when she ordered eggs! They ultimately got eggs to her, but seriously?! The event manager was even talking to her during brunch! We got nothing for the inconvenience or anything. Rather odd since it was the same people as the night before for a private event..... Because the night before was fine, I'm giving them 2 stars. Based on Saturday brunch, I'd say no stars. No, thank you!",

The pork was tender and juicy, the pasta fresh and perfectly cooked, and the seasonal salad was a huge crowd pleaser. We have always been very impressed with the food at Bar Marco, after having several delicious dinners there. And the food at the engagement party was just as wonderful. In addition to the food, our service was excellent. Andrew, the events coordinator, and his team, were friendly and attentive. Our guests loved talking to them! The event space was perfect, and everything ran smoothly from start to finish.  We have not stopped receiving compliments on the party. Andrew was so fun and easy to work with. He helped us every step of the planning process, and made it simple and stress- free. We highly recommend Bar Marco for an event (or just for dinner)!",

Drinks are good and usually can find a special being offered. Really fantastic selection of wines. Food is always above board with flavor and freshness.

We started out with mimosas and perused the menu. Eventually deciding on the donuts to split. The mimosas were absolutely nothing special, by the donuts were great.   I ended up ordering the soft scrambled eggs and my boyfriend got the croque BLT. Both of our meals were pretty good, but my boyfriend was still hungry (typical!).   Here's what we didn't like... the wait staff seem to have a bit of an attitude about them. Apparently there was a large party of 20 about to get seated upstairs, so they told one table next to us that they had to order soon since the kitchen would be on hold when the large party ordered. Mind you, the table next to us hadn't even all arrived yet! Several other people were turned away because of this issue, too.   I loved the atmosphere here, so I would be willing to give another shot possibly for cocktails.",

Dominick Fiore is an entertaining and knowledgeable host. I learned so much about the wines we were drinking. Another nice touch to the dinner is once you finish your wine Dom will refill you. They are not cheap about the wine tasting, my glass was never empty. The food was over the top. We had six courses with a new wine to compliment each new dish. The portions were generous. I was so full by the end of the third course. You have to pace yourself. My favorite was the homemade pasta course. It was so fresh and cooked to aldente perfection. The table was made up of five couples and we were all the best of friends by the end of the night. We continued the party after with our new friends and got drinks downtown. They made us feel so special and put a personalized birthday greeting on our final pairing and wine list we took home with us. I am so happy we got to experience and celebrate in the wine room. Thanks Bar Marco!!!",

We were the only diners in the place when we walked in (two people at the bar).   While Bar Marco is still developing its venue, I do like the industrial feel. The chairs could use some cushions and the space could be heated more as I was freezing by the time dinner was done. Some other not so great things:  * Their water wasn't filtered so you could taste the calcium * While there isn't anything wrong with PBR I haven't drank it since college so makes me raise my eyebrows to see it on a menu at a restaurant ranked 3 $ signs * The red wine was meh * And the service/host was well meaning and nice (he made sure that we always had a drink in hand - I like that style) but he got more spacey towards the end. You only have so much patience..  The oks: * Chocolate pairings - I am not a huge fan of chocolate and hard liquor so while a nice concept just wasn't for me * Arancini  However I do like to end on a positive note: * The vanilla orange thing drink - fantastic, bringing me back to the days of when I would drink Orange Julius every day and you'll find yourself finishing it within seconds * cheese, meat and things plate - quince paste, cheddar and spicey coppa stood out but we ordered six items and I would have gladly eaten it all * patatas bravas - potato chucks fried to perfection with a spicy sauce * duck blt - yes to anything with bacon! * greens and beans * goat ragu - al dente but I thought it was good, nothing spectacular tho * fish w/ raisins, onions and some other stuff * And lastly for all the things that we ate the price came out totally reasonable which I was pleasantly surprised by  I would go back to Bar Marco when the weather warms up as I can see it being pleasant and only for drinks and snacks, not for dinner.",

All they had to do was post photos to facebook and offer champagne to the first 20 reservations and voila! I had a reservation for 6 for the inauguration day for brunch.  I do LOVE places that keep their Facebook/website like super up-to-date!  Much appreciated!!  This place is cool.  It's cool for evening cocktails, appetizers, happy hour, or brunch.  It is also slightly \"cold\" as in, the acoustics.  It can be difficult to hear the person next to you when you turn your head.  Everything is like, concrete, tin, marble, tile, etc.  The tables and bar are nicely placed and the menu has prices and is easy to read.  There were no cocktails listed on the brunch menu, though, which I didn't really like, but since I've been for drinks before, I kind of knew what they had.  The sangria was small, but it was only $5 (but sangria is a cheap drink...)  I got the whiskey cured salmon.  It comes with cream cheese and capers and rye bread.  It was good, but a very small portion for $13.  I left hungry.  The risotto looked delicious.  A friend got the yogurt with an extra egg and she seemed to enjoy it.  They did bring out a complimentary little cup of the yogurt with apple slices before hand, which was nice, but we had no spoons!  I asked for spoons about twice and never got them.  Then someone picked up our yogurts before we were ever able to eat it :(  The service is friendly (I've been once for cocktails and it was great service at the bar), but it was a little \"first time-y\", with the little things.  For example, we had a water jug, but no water glasses.  Then we had glasses but no more water. Had to ask a few times for it before we took a jug from an empty table.  The sangria took a good 20 min to get.  The food also took a while, but it was their first time, so that's understandable I guess.  I hope that they improve.  I'd give the brunch 3 stars and the regular hours 4-5 stars.  I'd also love to see the patio that they are planning.  I think this place has tons of potential.  Dear Bar Marco, get it together-really together, very soon!  The Pittsburgh market is getting competitive for these kinds of places and I don't want you to be left out with bad reviews!  You're right at the edge of not being new anymore and going to lose people with a bad experience.  I will be back, but I'd like it to be a go-to place and it's not quite there yet.

    "text": "Decided to try this place because we heard it was good, food is not so bad but it definitely needs more variety on the menu, the worst part was that the service is horrible, and if the servers are making a salary working here and are not getting tips, they certainly are not living up to what their salary is, considering the salary they receive the service should be exceptional!  We waited 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar.. Not acceptable.. Esp when there's only 6 people at the bar, the bartender was attending more to the servers and the drinks they needed for their tables rather than the people sitting at the bar. Our server was considerably slow, drinks took forever as well at the table, God forbid you wanted to your ask your server for something.. you could not find her! Anywhere!!! We then skipped coffee/dessert because of this and just wanted our check! Sad to say this was a special occasion with our family that was in from out town .We will not return... Very disappointed.",

I've been here a few times now and the first time I went they used to have a drink menu but now they seemed to have done away with that.  Though with the group I was with the bartender did an excellent job of asking of what kind of flavors we like and what kind of liquors we like and making up something interesting for us. Each one was a fun and interesting surprise, so that was a nice experience.  But I still kind of like having a drink menu with specialties of the house cocktails that I can pursue and consider something interesting I may not have considered normally.  All the food I've had there has been excellent, though some dishes can be on the smaller or pricier side.  The cheese and meat plate I had last time was fantastic with some interesting choices, as was the burger and other small plates I had.  They were also great about accommodating a large group I went with of about 12 people on a weeknight when we made a reservation in advance, though their seating area is relatively small.  It was a little cold and drafty in there though on a really cold winter evening (and we were not next to the door), but that was my only complaint.",

    "text": "Steve and I came here on a whim Saturday night after seeing it was doing pretty well with Yelpers.  Interestingly, the couple sitting next to us at the bar had also decided to make a visit based on favorable reviews on Urbanspoon.  Bobby, our friendly bartender (and one of the owners), had heard of neither of these review sites but was pleased to hear his new business was getting good word of mouth!    We were really just in the market for drinks that night but the menu looked interesting so we also ended up getting some snacks.  As mentioned in other reviews, the menu leaves something to be desired in that it does not provide you with explanations or descriptions of anything, but as we were sitting at the bar, we had Bobby to pester with all of our questions and he happily gave us all the information we needed and made recommendations...many of which were NOT the most expensive things on the menu!  (I hate when servers do that).    One standout from the evening was the lomo, which is a cured pork loin, and was subbed in for the prosciutto on the snack menu.  I had never even heard of lomo, but Bobby said we had to try it and I'm so glad we did...it was amazing.  Just melt-in-your-mouth, buttery, delicious.  We also loved the Patatas Bravas, which were brought out complimentary for us to share with our neighbors, noting that it pairs really well with the Gimlet (which it did!).  I think we might have tried every drink on the menu that evening but I was really impressed with the Manhattan and Steve really liked the Gimlet.  I'm not sure what it was called, but Bobby mentioned a drink of \"red wine mixed with cola\" which \"all the young people in Spain drink\".  By this point in the evening, that sounded exotic enough to peak my interest so I gave it a go.  I won't say I loved it, but it was definitely interesting!    There are some big plans for this place, the upstairs is intended to be an art gallery/wine bar and plans for an amazing outdoor patio are in the works.  Overall, I think this place is doing an excellent job for having only been open a short time and Steve and I definitely plan to come back, next time for dinner!",

Most of the wait staff was friendly, and one of the guys ended up having to explain each drink to us, because we were unfamiliar with them and the menu lacked any description.  The overall vibe to the place is something like a trendy casual bar you'd find somewhere in Rome.    I will say though, once we ordered our first round, the service seemed to slack off.  Took quite a while to get our server's attention for some more drinks and it took even longer to get the check from him.  Nonetheless, I will definitely be back, especially once the upstairs wine bar/art gallery are open.",

What a great idea if you want to try something new every week.  I was lucky enough to come by on a day they were serving Vegan food.  Some of the best vegan food I've had in Pittsburgh.  Multiple courses and was very filling.  It was a little pricey but I enjoyed the flavors.  I won't go into what we ate specifically as it was a Monday and it changes every week.

Don't get excited about their online menu- it is not what you will receive when you arrive.  Anywho, I had an idea of where this place was- the old Firehouse Lounge if you're familiar.  Thank goodness two of my friends showed up at the same time as me to confirm- as there is NO signage whatsoever.  We walk in and....hello big thick gray curtains!  I pull one back slightly to reveal a dinner enjoying his meal.  I was literally right on top of this guy!  Note to Bar Marco- get another door or something.  Those curtains are not what's hot.  I didn't love my cocktail- the aperol something or other.  It could have had a little more oomph.  I should consider that it was 1pm and I shouldn't need a super stick drink.  Two people in my group ordered Bloody Mary's that looked more Mary than bloody (not enough juice, or alcohol really).  While the place was tiny, loud and a bit pricey, the saving grace was those pancakes.  Did I mention that they were sold out of most of the stuff we originally ordered?  No bueno.  I probably wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "OK I'll be honest.  I was fending off visiting this place the first time I heard about it a few months ago. A coworker told me that a \"wine bar\" had replaced my beloved embury.  I was in dismay.  I loved firehouse, embury, & Spencer (yes in exactly that combo!).  It was a great place to meet up friends, and bring out of towners, and really impress them.    As i digress.......  After a fun filled evening of doing taxes, and DH and I decided to hit up Bar Marco, in hopes of something good.  I had seen some good yelp reviews, and I always trust my yelpers... so my expectations were set high!   I was sorely disappointed.  First off the place looks like it was just thrown together.. and I understand it's new blah blah blah.  But please have some decency to put in some plush \"comfortable\" chairs and possibly um a heater?  It wouldn't hurt.  I kept my coat on the whole time (sad face).  I ordered a glass of wine, which was good... but for being a \"wine bar\" they didn't have much selection.  If in fact is that what they are?    On to the food... I was totally unimpressed.  The saffron arancini balls (serving size 2 for 8 dollars, um that's $4 a pop for fried rice&cheese balls... are you kidding!?! ).  Now I'm one for good quality food, even if the portion size is small I don't mind paying for quality, this just wasn't good.  Along with our thinly sliced cheese (it was transparent!) and flavorless meat platter I was shaking my head.  Wishing that embury would magically appear... here's to hoping.",

    "text": "I'm going to break it down and perhaps my star rating will make sense to you and to me...b/c I was wavering between a 2 or a 3.    Background: Group of 5 (girls night) wanting to check out Bar Marco for drinks and dinner.  We made reservations for a Thursday night, but it wasn't necessary as we were the only ones at a table.  There were a handful of people at the bar, but tables empty.    Decor: Industrial and incomplete.  I get that they are new, but there's definitely more work to be done...get er done!  Chairs are cold and not that comfortable...it sorta feels like your sitting in a cold (the door brings in frequent drafts) high school cafeteria.  But a whole lot smaller.    Drinks: Gimlet - made with tequila.  I was a bit worried b/c I'm not a huge fan of tequila but it was a mild flavoring balanced by the sweet red pepper.  Overall, I was a fan but perhaps it was relative to my next drink (ugh).  As mentioned in other reviews, the gimlet is a bit watery (too much ice?) but after a few sips it was better.     Aperol spritz - cough, cough...medicine that is.  That's what it tasted like to me, not a fan, had a few sips but couldn't finish it.   Food: Our waiter told us that they (assuming chefs) would choose for us if we'd like. We were all down for that b/c we felt like they'd know best on what they make really well.  So here goes...  Cheese/Meat plate: Now I can't remember everything on it, but I'll try to describe it: Walnut Pesto - it was ground up walnuts sweetened with something molded into a circle - tasty! Quince paste - it's like a jam, a bit fruity - indifferent.   Aged Cheddar - I like my cheeses sharp which this was not - average. Unidentified soft white cheese - it has a bite to it - good. Prosciutto - unexpectedly spicy - yum! Dirty martini salami - looked like a pepperoni with some peppercorns - weird tasting, did not taste like pepperoni (which I like).  Snacks: Arancini w/ fried egg - decent, but Il Pizziaola makes it best!  It's basically a fried risotto ball.  The fried egg wasn't necessary and didn't add much to the dish.   Duck BLT - not a fan, but the rest of the group really liked this.   Greens & Beans - yum - this was delish.  It's white beans and kale in some sorta white sauce.   Patatas Bravas - yum - this was delish.  Fried potatoes with a smoky tomato chipotle like sauce is how I'd describe it.  Sauce was great.     Entrees: We shared Goat Ragu - I felt like I was eating a dirty sock.  Did I mention I don't like goat meat, so this could have influenced the dirty laundry reference.  The pasta also seemed a bit undercooked.   Fish - I can't remember the details, but it was a white fish and had raisins, pine nuts, and some other seasonings.  It was really good.  Who would of thought fish and raisins would go together...apparently Bar Marco did.    Chocolate/Drink Flight Pairing Dark Chocolate - indifferent.   Chocolate covered Orange rind - tasted like a chocolate covered orange gummie slice.  good.   White chocolate - tasted like lemon cheese, not good.    You're probably thinking, \"Whoa - that's a ton of food and whoa that's a long review\" - um no, the plates are small and we each could have 1-2 bites of most things.  And, yes, this is a long ass review.    Service Ummm...hmmm...this is a tough one and I feel sorta bad that I can't just say \"good\", b/c it wasn't good but it wasn't bad - it was weird, odd, uncomfortable, distracting, annoying, funny - basically every other adjective other than \"good\" or \"bad\".  You have to go there to experience it.    Highlight reel: Gimlet, Patatas Bravas, Greens & Beans, maybe the fish entree, my friends (star rating not increased by my awesome friends).",

    "text": "Bar Marco is not Embury, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.   This bar/restaurant has completely revamped the first floor - opening it up and painting everything white. It's a spectacular space. The second floor is a dead unused cavern.   They are self-professed at having a small, tasty food menu with highlights being nibbles from the Crested Duck Charcuterie. They have an interesting and small wine list. Their cocktail list is also interesting, but could use some more explanation. One of my dining companions was not impressed by the \"Bar Marco Manhattan\" which could have been remedied by simply listing the basic ingredients. After only 4 weeks being open, their paper menu listed only 3 red wines, and one of them was under substitution. The website is similarly out of date.   Sitting in Embury's old digs is tough competition. Bar Marco has promise. I love the concept of their food, wine, cocktails, and space, but at this point, all are lacking something in execution. I'm looking forward to returning after some more finishing touches when I hope they can earn another star.",

Our water was never refilled until we asked. It took about 40 minutes to get out food, and one order was completely forgotten about. So we waited another 15 minutes for that. While we were waiting for that last order, our spacey server asked how everything was and we replied \"just waiting in the other order\" and he goes \"excellent.\" Uh, what? We were not asked if we wanted refills on our bloody Mary's either. The only saving grace was the food was good. I hope they step up their game with the service. Not impressed at all.",

    "text": "(See update below for a more recent assessment)  Between 3 and 4 stars. 4 stars for the effort, and because it's a new place. 3 for the service and cocktails that can improve a bit.   Small, but nice crowd on Saturday evening. Our party of 4 was able to find a table to sit and drink, and the bar was not too noisy. Does not happen in every bar in Pittsburgh. Not the undergrad crowd, which is definitely a plus (say 25+).  Service was a tad deficient. It was hard to get the attention of the staff, and it took them a while to serve us. On the other hand, the staff is very friendly.   Their gimlet could be stronger and less watery (start with less ice, perhaps - also I am not entirely sure about the red pepper in it), but the manhattan was good. The list of cocktails is small. A longer list would be nice.   The price is right for this kind of place. Most cocktails are around $8-10.  *Update* 10/2012: I've been back there a few times, and overall I still like it, but I now have a more detailed views of what to like and what to dislike there.   what's to like: The list of cocktails has grown very much since I was there. It's now substantial, and some of the cocktails are hits. Go for it, try, retry, and reretry.  What's ok: The appetizers are still fine, although not extraordinary. Their bacon +dates are dry, and surely not worth $10. Their cold cuts are very good on the other hand.  What's to dislike: I ate there recently, and I was under impressed. Based on my food (pork shoulder), I'd give only 2 stars. Surely not worth the $20 or so I paid for it.   Upshot: I'll be back for cocktails, and probably for cheese and cold cuts. I'll skip the food. So will you if you are wise.",

After some conversation and his will power to convenience the kitchen to make a cheese plate, which wasn't on the menu, he made me an outstanding off the wall single Scotch cocktail. So to summarize, the staff and service make this place a gem. That said, as a business traveler and out-of-towner, this place is great to all tastes.",

We got all the pastas besides the gnocchi . The ones I enjoyed the most were the risotto and rigatoni. The place had a intimate, date vibe.

Rest assured, I believe anything you order in the way of food or crafted cocktails will be enjoyed. During my visit this week, myself and dining companion ordered the kale Caesar salad, which was finely chopped and tossed with the light dressing evenly. Several strips of anchovies were on the top which easily could be removed if you don't prefer those. Had a delicious onion soup which didn't have the heavy cheese covering on the top which sometimes can be unmanageable to keep on your spoon. Our server was intimately familiar with all of the menu items and she also pointed out when presenting the check at the end that they don't accept tips and the service is included in the price of the items.",

The bartender is fantastic. I was going to order a drink off the menu, but he suggested that he make one of his own after asking me a few questions. The drink was fantastic and unlike anything I had ever had. I highly suggest ordering a drink directly from the bartender.   The pastas (we ordered the wild boar chestnut fettuccine and the orecchiette) were perfectly cooked and dressed well. They were not huge portions so I would definitely suggest appetizers if you're ordering a pasta for your main dish. The Caesar salad was super fresh and delicious too. The pork belly appetizer was good, but not great-- it was a little dry.   I would definitely come back for a nice occasion!",

The experience was already off to a bad start because the Strip District is the worst place to be on the weekends. Thankfully after driving around for probably 30 min I was able to find a spot in their side lot. Which is a major bonus I have to say!  After all that driving around I obviously needed a drink so I went with my brunch favorite, a bloody mary. I'm very picky about my bloody mary's and I would say this one met my standards. My only complaint was the price to portion ratio. If you want to charge a decent amount for drinks they shouldn't be small.   Entree wise I decided to go with the baked eggs. I figured it was something you don't see often at brunch so why not switch it up. While it was definitely tasty, there sadly wasn't anything special about it. Nothing about it made me wish I could have more or made me want to come back to have it again. I guess I should have expected that with baked eggs but I felt like they could have done something more. Maybe some veggies mixed in or add some spice to it to take it up a notch!",

    "text": "So happy I finally got the chance to try this place over the weekend.  I would recommend making a reservation as the seating inside is very limited.  The inside is very small and rusticky which goes with their overall theme.  For drinks my wife and I both had a mimosa, and I also had a vodka drink which I forget the name of.  The mimosa was one of the best I've had.  Perfect balance of orange juice and champagne.  You could also tell the orange juice was fresh.  My vodka drink was also very good.  While the drinks are a little pricey, you get what you pay for and also have to keep in mind that there is no tipping allowed here so the prices reflect this.  For my meal I had the Bar Marco Burger.  I had heard great things about this burger and it did not disappoint.  It was cooked perfectly to start.  I'm not sure what blend of meats they use, but it was amazing.  Not that the flavor of the meat needed much help, but the aioli, crisp bacon, and onion really putting it over the top.  It was a juicy burger, but the bun they use was a great fit and didn't let it get sloppy.  I also had the potatoes and hollandaise.  The potatoes were crisp and delicious.  The hollandaise sauce had a different, but awesome flavor that went perfect with them.  Can't wait to come back to this place and maybe try something different, but that burger would be tough to not get.  Easily one of the tops in the city.",

Super cool vibe - I think it used to be an old firehouse (?) but it has a very industrial interior, hipster-y feel, and the workers there are all SO GENUINELY NICE. Service was amazing - did I mention that this is a no gratuity restaurant? The price definitely reflects the no-gratuity part, because it is a little bit on the higher end, but totally worth it. Also read online that the staff here receive a salary and health benefits - seriously, who wouldn't want to support that?   Came here with a small group for Saturday brunch - drinks were delicious, the server was so attentive, and the food was amazing! Seriously can't wait for my next weekend off with friends to come here again. HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone visiting PGH for the weekend. Make sure you get the potatoes with the hollandaise sauce to start! I got the baked eggs here and since then, I've been trying to imitate the recipe (with not much luck :'D). My friend got the burger with fried egg and was talking about it for days after - which says a lot, since she is very particular with her food! Also the waiter gave me a large plate of salad on the side for free :D Gotta have my veggies. Ty! Would recommend e-mailing for reservation in advance in case there's a wait.",

    "text": "Loved finally trying this cute little restaurant at the end of the strip district! We made a reservation for brunch on a Saturday morning.  We started off with mimosas and OHMYGOSH, seriously the best, freshest, crisp mimosa I ever had, and I've had a lot of mimosas. All the drinks are puns on pop songs and made with fresh ingredients. They are small, so sip slowly!  I had the French toast with apples on top and the potatoes with hollandaise sauce. The food came out nice and hot. The French toast was very tasty. The potatoes were good too and the sauce had a little kick, mmm.  I love the atmosphere here and service is sooo nice. They do not accept gratuity, so some of the prices reflect this, but I really liked the touch. That did not stop our server, Kyle, from being amazing! He was tentative and sooo friendly.  It's a really nice spot for couples, I don't know if I'd come with a large group. The area is small and a bit intimate with a rustic feel. We will be back!  (They also seasonally change their menu- so I cannot wait to see what the spring has in store!)",

Meat plate Cheese plate Meat/Cheese plate Burger  Restaurants, an online menu makes sense when it's updated!   Odd door-front curtains. It's a cool entrance but corny from inside.. is it to separate crammed dining room from those waiting? It sticks out, and Bar Marco is more a dim-lit+high chatter+blend-in vibe. Dark with a stifling dash of hipster.  Service was slammed, one guy working the 8 tables out front. Our second round of drinks took 25 minutes. He apologized before we could comment when he dropped the check, so they're good enough to realize it. Descriptions were on-point 75%, occasional stuttering and stammering when questioned.   The bar is novelty. \"We have no cocktail menu\" she challenged with a smirk. Game on! Drink #1 was awesome, ordered in person. Drink #2 was third-person via waiter, and it came out with 2/5 the ingredients asked for. Conclusion: SIT AT THE 6-PERSON BAR, WHOLE MEAL. That said, neither drink was more standout than a good cocktail from a printed-menu.. anticipate that novelty wearing thin on return trips.  Food is decent at best, mix of tapas and classy bar. Cheese plate is a cheese plate, the earthy honey and jalapeno jelly the highlight. The fried smelt needs more lime and salt, the fish arguably too delicate for frying though the light mayo cuts the oil well. The tartare is well-diced with few clumps but way over-spiced, cumin masking the meal. The bolognese was bland and the sauce watery with chemical hints. Definitely could do with more salt and another minute on the noodles.  If the bar is one reason I'd return, the pork belly is the other. Everyone does pork belly these days. Bar Marco actually does it right: perfectly crisp edge with the piping hot sticky gob of fat melting in your mouth. No \"sour\" per the menu, but the definite highlight. Adult candy.",

We asked our server for his four favorite cocktails, and ended up with a veritable rainbow of both color and flavor in front of us. Mine was a delicious mint and rye drink, and my lady's a sweet gin and lavender drink. The best one on the table came in a margarita glass with an egg white mixed in, and tasted like an orange creamsicle.  I'll be back every time I visit Pittsburgh.",

The service, quality of food on the ever changing menu and the ambiance are always fabulous.

This is a place people to go to be able to say they went. \"Oh, you've never been?\" they'll sniff. If your tolerance for that sort of thing exceeds mine, it's a lovely venue.   Second-worst: they play the music so loud that everyone has to yell. Everyone except for the staff, to whom you're perpetually saying \"I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.\" If you're looking for a swank place to take a date to whom you don't want to talk, this is the restaurant for you.  Second-best part: The menu is very limited, and for me it's sometimes hard to find something that sounds appealing. It ranges from adequate to quite good. The bacon-wrapped dates are killer (they're hard to screw up), and I often just order two of those instead of an entree.  The portions are small.  Best part: You go here for the cocktails. Designer all. Yes, they're ootsy. They're also best in class. The finest Manhattan I've ever had, I had here. I can't remember the bartender's name, but he's an artist. He even conducts Manhattan-making classes.",

We just came in and snacked, but are planning on coming in sometime for breakfast because the things we did sample were pretty delish! Also, they get a lot of stuff for their breakfast menu (and I'm assuming the rest of their menu) from the fruit stands at the market down the street! So fresh and yummy!  Pros: Atmosphere-loved the quirky decorations and laid back feel, food, drinks, service, purse hooks under the bar :)  Cons: Bloody Mary, creepy art upstairs...sorry but that was Creepsville USA up there. I'm all for the art gallery upstairs, just not a bunch of death/execution scenes right before I eat my breakfast. yikes.",

The ambiance was lovely: it's on the first floor of the old Firehouse Lounge, where Embury used to be, and although it's dimly lit and has kept some of that cozy Prohibition-era atmosphere, it also feels more open and  airy than I remember Embury being. A number fun little abstract paintings add some color to the place.  They have a great cocktail menu (and a NICE whiskey selection). The chef's selection meat & cheese plate was a perfect appetizer for a group of our size to share, and I also highly recommend the the bacon-wrapped dates with manchego cheese. All except for one of us ended up ordering the winter salad (w/ kale, dried cherries, and some type of wheat berry-like grain), and it did not disappoint.  The only reason this place does not get five stars from me is the price, which I feel is a bit prohibitive for someone of my current graduate school income level, at $10-12 a drink. But it's definitely a great one-Friday-a-month spot to gather with a small group of friends, and a great demonstration of Strip District-style charm for any out -of-towners I might want to impress.",

The server talks to you about what you like then concord something from your preferences. We would have gotten more than two each if it weren't for the slow service.  This is where bar Marco looses a star. Really they should lose 2 but the food was so good and the drinks so tasty I am only deducting one. They have recently switched to paying all their servers a living wage and benefits so you don't need to tip. I would heartily support this if our service hadn't been so poor. The guy was very nice and friendly but he took forever to get to us and then u sat around with an empty glass wanting another drink too often and for too long. It was busy, but the not that busy. Maybe when you don't work for tips you don't have to care about good service.  I really love that they pay their people a living wage, but for the price I paid for brunch (even factoring in the tip) I really expect better service.",

The staff is small enough that after you've been 3-4 times you'll notice it's all the same folks and their friendly and often will remember you. The food is consisentantly impressive. The thing about Bar Marco is they have a lot of different kinds of food nights. Yes they have a standard menu for normal nights, but holidays they feature food appropriate for that day. They have guest chefs in often, and they seem to me to be excellent collaborators.   So one of my first visits to BM was for Fat Tuesday I was there with friends and we shared some beignets, I had some pork belly with grits, and a cocktail, the meal was superb and really it wasn't even that expensive. The atmosphere is excited, intimate, dimly lit, but friendly.  Next I've been in here a handful of times for brunch. They are a Sat/Sun brunch place which is important to note since not everywhere in Pgh is. The brunch menu isn't huge, but what they're offering keeps me coming back (it's delicious!). The pork belly benedict is other worldly. And again, even when I've had to come by myself (I'd rather brunch alone than not at all) the staff has always been super kind to me and excited to share their opinions on what is the best drink they're making currently.  Most recently I went in and there was a wait (no tables or bar space available) and I was like OMG! but not to worry, and attentive waiter showed me a counter by the window and even got my party drinks while we waited for a table to open up. Problem solved. promptly and with alcohol. yay.  Like I said at the beginning this place feels like home to me and I keep going because they keep dishing up interesting exciting meals that make me feel pleased to have shared a meal with them.",

My friends and I ended up getting the patatas bravas, Marco burger, octupus, and bucatini. Despite the fact that the ingredients are locally sourced, I was not impressed with the execution of the food. The Marco burger was beyond greasy that it was hard to eat and it was a bigger portion size compared to the bucatini. I've had better food at other places in Pittsburgh for a lesser price. Bar Marco was a place for me to experience once to see why everyone has been raving about it. It doesn't hurt to try the place and decide for yourself!",

    "text": "I arranged a birthday dinner for my husband this past Saturday for 8 people. My experience was wonderful from start to finish.  While this was not my first time at Bar Marco (I already knew I loved it), this experience was even better than our previous ones.  Making a reservation - I called to see if the wine room was available, but thought it would be difficult with a party of 8. While they said that they could fit us in at 5:30 (a bit early for us), the person I spoke with also said he could fit us in the main dining room and we could choose to have a similar menu up there.  Since timing fit better, we decided to do that, but I was so pleasantly surprised at how friendly and accommodating they were.  Dinner - We were seated first at a pretty small table (or two tables) for 8 people, but were promptly (without even asking) given an additional table when the one next to us opened up, before even our whole party had arrived. The dinner started out with a complimentary rose \"sipper\" and we decided to do the family style dinner - I would recommend this to anyone, especially a larger party. It's 4-5 courses, and each course has a few different dishes. I thought the value was tremendous - but you do need to be hungry! For the first course, we had a pork rillette, chicken terrine, and arancini. All were phenomenal!  The second course - a fish (can't remember name) carpaccio and DELICIOUS lamb ribs. The third - housemade pasta and mushroom ravioli. Fourth - two pork dishes and a DELECTABLE fried chicken. And, dessert. While dessert wasn't the must scrumptious dessert ever, it was very good, and we were all pretty full by that point anyway.    Drinks - they don't have a drink menu, but ask what your \"go-to\" liquor is,and general drink profile/favorite cocktail.  All the drinks were phenomenal. And, sometimes, when they explain the drink, you think \"how did they get to that?\" but once I tried it, it was always spot on. As well, they brought us an after dinner apertif in honor of my husband's birthday.  The whole staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating - from setting up the reservation until the last minute.  Also, the dinner was incredibly leisurely, and they didn't rush the courses or try to hurry us out. It truly made the night very special.",

I recently went to Bar Marco with a group of friends who chose to do the family style dinner. Jamilka, knowing and remembering my food allergies (we went back to check with her before the meal and she ticked them off without a thought), made me a unique but equally complex dish for each serving. I can't begin to say how delicious they all were!! Numerous fresh ramps and lovely vegetables cooked to perfection, including a chicken dish that was delicious. After thanking her for the meal she said that she would always accommodate my needs. She is truly wonderful and talented. I cannot wait to return for dinner!",

    "text": "Was told not to miss the Strip District while working on a project an hour away. Since I had this restaurant bookmarked for a while, took the time yesterday to visit for brunch. And I'm so happy we did! First, it's located in Firestation No 7, built in 1860. It's small, intimate and wonderfully quirky. The food is delicious and filling. My dining partner was late which was no problem for me. Bloody Mary while waiting. It was simple, pure and well-made, not one of the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" types so prevalent on brunch menus today. The menu is also simple but I still had a hard time deciding on just one thing so we shared. For starters: cinnamon pull-aparts. These puffy little pillows of cinnamon goodness were coated in caramel that maintained the right consistency, even when it cooled. I wanted to lick the plate. A small dish of creme anglaise was served alongside for dipping on pouring over the top...your choice. Our entrees included the smoked salmon benny and the grilled carrot cake. The \"benny\" was exactly what you would think: a take on eggs benedict but with a fluffy biscuit (that tasted as rich as puff pastry), layered with smoked salmon, topped with a perfectly poached egg and kissed with hollandaise. The grilled carrot cake was prepared like French toast with mascarpone cheese, walnuts and, thank heavens a side of bacon...otherwise I may have gone into a sugar coma. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive and all of the servers were highly knowledgeable not only about the menu but also about the history of the building and events happening throughout the week at the restaurant. I will be back. I have to try the eggs in purgatory.",

Service was excellent - they were incredibly friendly and accommodating, and they use a lot of local suppliers. Plus, the venue is very cute.  To eat, we started with a Spicy Melon Gazpacho with a basil puree - so deliciously refreshing!! The entree consisted of Wahoo Loin (a white fish) with heirloom tomatoes, chanterelle mushrooms, and a red sauce. Again - yum! And then we had my favorite dish of all - a Pound Cask with brandied cherries and whipped cream. I could have eaten an entire cake!  I also want to add they have a great (and unique) cocktail selection, as well as a nice wine selection. Each of the courses was paired with a glass of wine, so I was able to try a few, and they did a nice job with the pairings.",

Place - it's in the Strip and usually I have trouble locating things there, but it was pretty easy to find. The outside looks like an old firehouse? and the inside is really cute. The front has big windows and there's a bar table by the window and then there are small tables throughout the place with the bar in the back. When it gets darker, they light the little candles on your table.  Drinks - I got a grower 75. Not bad! Some gin, some lemon, and some champagne. YUM. My friend got a caipirinha. It was just like what the waiter described it as. It was like a mojito minus the mint flavor.  Food - I ordered a side of polenta fries, but they had just run out ): So then I went for the tiramisu. It had a nice coffee taste and it was really soft. I enjoyed! Another friend got the pate. I don't like pate so I didn't try any, but it looked weird and looked like mold had grown on it.  Service - People are really friendly and are patient with questions and such.  Also, bathrooms were clean. (+1)",

Only the best ingredients are selected to make up the seasonal dishes. Since it is seasonal, I highly suggest you come often if they are serving something you love as you never know when the menu will change.   Some of my favorite dishes I've had so far are the donuts with lemon curd, any pesto dish, and the cheese plate gBar Marco caused me to become obsessed with Capital Brothers cheese).   They have private events such as weddings, so reservations are recommended. You can check out their menu online before coming and it's updated pretty regularly so you know what to expect. It's also just far enough away from the busiest parts of the Strip so you can typically find street parking within a block.",

We had silly little martinis because they couldn't make cosmopolitans due to the lack of cranberry juice (no cranberry juice in a restaurant that offers brunch?). But no biggy. Our pasta entrees, rigatoni and gnocchi, were excellent, as was the olive oil cake desert. The wine list, all natural wines, was impressive for its diversity and fair prices. Service, without the tip incentive, was very good. Because it's an old firehouse, the dining room is somewhat odd, small but with a very high ceiling. However, it's all about the excellent food!",

I have experienced not only the main dining room at Bar Marco, but also the event space upstairs (The Union Hall), as well as The Wine Room in the cellar. The staff is extremely courteous, professional and friendly, which I'm sure is due in part to incredible management.   The restaurant is on the small side, so be sure to reserve a table in advance. The Union Hall is a gorgeous space where we hosted our wedding reception for 60 people. The Wine Room was PHENOMENAL where Andrew led us through the most fantastic five course meal with all natural wine pairings.   I can not recommend this establishment enough.

First course was a beet salad with goat cheese and the wine paired with was perfect. They keep pouring it too. Incredible service. Then scallops with squash. Melt in your mouth scallops. Next we have gnocchi. That was thier own take on gnocchi wasn't my favorite but the wine made up for it. Then ribeye over broccoli and cheese risotto. Finally olive oil cake with apples.

We came in for Sunday brunch without a reservation and were told that the wait would be an hour. This was fine with us--we were looking forward to trying Bar Marco and we could spend some time walking around the Strip. When we came back an hour later, we had to wait an additional 15 minutes which bothered us because there were multiple tables who had clearly been done eating for a while and were just sitting around. It's a small space, if you see other people waiting, be a little considerate. Once we were finally seated, it took about 5 more minutes to actually get our hands on a menu, which was irritating after waiting so long already.  The guys who work there were really cool about it all and acknowledged that we had waited way longer than we should have and apologized. I'm a vegetarian, and our waiter sat down and went through the menu with me to let me know what my options were, which I thought was really nice.   I decided to get the pancakes, my boyfriend got the smoked trout eggs benedict, and we split an order of potatoes with hollandaise sauce. It was all so delicious, but we agreed that my pancakes were the best. The pancakes themselves were a bit lemony and were topped with a date and walnut mixture and whipped cream. Amazing! When our waiter brought us our check he told us that he gave us a 20% discount for waiting, which I was not expecting at all. The guys at Bar Marco tried their best to give us the best experience possible after waiting longer than we should have, and they definitely delivered. I'm looking forward to going back for lunch or dinner and trying some of their drinks.",

Tiny, but stylish, Bar Marco would fit well in Williamsburg (Brooklyn), but with a whiff of European panache.  As always, we sat at the bar, and we were immediately charmed by our server, who helped us with ordering.  Limited to the brunch menu, due to it being a Sunday afternoon, the choices still met all our culinary needs.   Donna's Frittata was delicious, the baked pasta having an explosion of wonderful flavors.  My risotto, with a fried egg on top, was cooked perfectly, creamy but not obliterated.  Too often risotto comes out of kitchens with the arborio rice destroyed.  The Bar Marco version was wonderful, and I loved how the egg's yolk dripped through the rice.  I loved it!  The side of fried potatoes, with hollandaise sauce cooked to the perfect temperature, was a self indulgent luxury.  My cardiologist would be pissed, but too bad, the food at Bar Marco is worth a little clogging.   Everyone in the place was incredibly welcoming.  The owner and the chef greeting us with laughter and smiles.  The warmth was contagious, as even the other patrons spread good cheer and happiness.  BTW, there is no tipping at Bar Marco.  The servers are on salary, a wonderful way to ensure great service and loyal workers.    Bar Marco is a fabulous place for a meal.  Every city should have one.  Bravissimo!",

    "text": "Ugh, it pains me a little to re-review Bar Marco and report a disappointing visit because I really like the space and I've had a good experience before, but here goes. Two of us came here for brunch just before New Year. I chose it because we had enjoyed it previously and also because we could make a reservation for two people (it was our last day in town and we wanted to fit a few things in, so didn't want to chance a long wait anywhere). We arrived and were seated promptly, gave our order, and then we waited, and waited, and waited. Neither of the tables either side of us (a party of four and one of six) who were both already there when we arrived had any food which made me a little anxious. And then our food arrived, ahead of the other tables which resulted in a bit of a hullabaloo from the four top -'why have they got their order, we were here first' kind of thing - which, although the waitstaff handled it well, made us feel uncomfortable.  Anyhow, although we had food, I have to admit that it wasn't great. My Chicken Milanese was overcooked and dry, the accompanying salad was bagged leaves that weren't in tip-top condition, and my husband's burger was on the small side. The Patatas Bravas type potatoes that we ordered as a side were good but I did find it odd that the burger didn't come with some sort of potato or side option apart from bagged salad. I was also disappointed that the only coffee option was filter coffee and that there were no 'barista-style' coffee options available.  I found the prices to be a little high considering the quality and portion size. Luckily they have a no-tipping policy because I didn't want to be in an awkward position where I undertipped but honestly I didn't feel like leaving 20%... So that was brunch, I can't see a return visit here I'm afraid.",

If that wasn't already bringing out the hangry monster in me, while we are waiting to be seated, we are quarantined in a curtained-off section by the door. Talk about awkward and uncomfortable. We shared the small space with 2 other parties waiting for their seats as well and let me tell ya, it was getting a little too close for comfort. The restaurant itself is very cute. It's a small space with limited seating, but I loved the trendy and chill atmosphere.   The menu is very limited with less than 10 options. At least it narrows down your choices. I ordered the baked eggs (vegetarian without bacon) which are prepared with tomatoes and chickpeas. Granted, you can't really mess up eggs so yes, it was good but for $13, I was expecting something a little more special. My boyfriend ordered the burger which is super fatty and greasy. He requested medium rare but it came out medium well. Neither entrees were winners. We at least ended on a positive note with their fried doughnuts which are made fresh in-house. The order comes with 3 doughnuts and a side of lemon curd and salted caramel dipping sauces. Holy moly it was so good! What can beat fried dough though?  Service was fantastic! I'll be honest, I thought that with the no tipping policy, the staff are more inclined to be lax about service quality but I was proven wrong. Our waiter was incredible - super friendly and made sure we were always taken care of.   Overall, I'm glad I finally tried Bar Marco, however, there are plenty of other brunch places in the area with better food at better prices.",

    "text": "So I made reservations to go to brunch here and I was incredibly impressed by not only the food but the service. They were even wonderful when we asked if it would be okay to push back our reservations by an hour in order to accommodate some last-minute shopping needs. The staff was so friendly and they told us no problem at all.  We got there and we sat at the bar for a drink while we are waiting for a table to be ready. The bartender, who should be the spokesperson for bar Marco, was so friendly and into his job he totally talked us into getting everything that he suggested. And all of his suggestions were spot-on. And I understand that what we did was super annoying asking for suggestions outside of the menu but he handled us perfectly. I truly cannot say enough about how awesome he was.  Then we basically ordered everything on the menu as we were getting seated. We ordered all three sides, the bacon, the donuts, and the potatoes. Then we each ordered an entree me with the smoked trout eggs benedict and my friend with the burger. We kind of went overboard with the food but it was our first time here and we wanted to try everything.  Out of the appetizers or extras that we ordered those donuts were amazing. So light and fluffy and so good. It came with the side of caramel sauce and a side of lemon sauce it was good was that my friend like the caramel and I like the lemon. Honestly I probably could have eaten three plates of those donuts and not gotten the bacon or the potatoes and I would have been fine. Honestly go and get the donuts. And if there's more people than you at the table get two orders.  The smoked eggs benedict was delicious. It was put over a Johnny cake, which I was unsure of but still wanted to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The entire meal was really well done and the presentation was beautiful. I would definitely suggest this eggs benedict if you are in eggs benedict fan like I am. The smoke trout was something that I've had before but not in this way and I was surprised at how much I liked it.  And the best part of bar Marco was when we found out that they pay their staff a salary and cover health benefits so there's no tipping. You might pay a little bit more for your meal but those benefits truly outweigh the cost. I would prefer to pay a little bit more if I knew that the staff was taken care of.  I look forward to going back and try and more things on the menu. If you are in the strip and looking for a fun place to go this is your spot. Try it out, make sure that you ask the bartender to mix you up something special.",

The place is pretty small so I would recommend making a reservation.  10am was just a little too early for cocktails, so we stuck with coffee and tea, served in classy glass mugs. They give you unlimited coffee refills and unlimited hot water refills with tea!  I had the orange ricotta pancakes, and we got a few orders of the donuts for the table to share. The donuts were good, but not particularly special. I wouldn't go out of my way to get them. The pancakes were delicious! They were somehow light and rich at the same time, and the orange taste was very refreshing  Overall, great food, great service, and nice ambiance. I would love to go back and try their drinks!",

Although limited, the brunch menu still has variety, but fails to serve any savory vegetarian entree options (only the soft scrambled eggs). I went with this entree and while the eggs were good, the portion size was very small. After polishing off my plate, I found myself still very hungry, which typically never happens to me when eating out. Similarly, all the friends I was with devoured their meals but still had room for more food.   So, word of advice: get both a side and an entree or even consider getting a meal and splitting an additional entree with another guest.",

The only thing I did not like about this burger is it was a little messy and hard to eat because I got an egg on it as well. But that is mainly my fault lol.

Everything else, however, was absolutely horrible.  We waited at the door for a few minutes waiting to be seated, even acknowledged.  After a while, we eventually sat ourselves to still no acknowledgement of our presence.  We made eye contact with the bar tender and watched him chat with customers, sample beers etc.  I eventually went up to ask for menus.    After the bartender brought us water, our waiter still had not shown up.  The restaurant wasn't at all busy so it was extremely frustrating trying to find anyone to serve us.  When we finally did get a drink order in, we ended up having to wait longer for 2 brunch cocktails than our food to be made.  Sitting watching our server and the bartender chat and NOT make our drinks was very frustrating.  When he finally brought our drinks, the bloody mary didn't even have the garnish and we were told we'd get them in a minute.    I don't have high standards for service, I just expect to be noticed in an establishment where I'm spending $10 a drink.  I would have given this place an easy 10 stars if it weren't for the terrible service.",

We thought about our favorite, M&P (I always find a way to work them into a review), for brunch, but with the Steelers and Pirates game going on, we wanted to avoid downtown. This was not a bad second choice.  I ordered the polenta and shrimp and it was probably the most perfect polenta and shrimp dish I have ever had at a restaurant. Everything about it was delectable and delightful. My only complaint was that I wanted a lot more! :)  Our server was pretty cool, though at one point we felt rushed. I get it - it's brunch, you want to flip tables, but as it was our last day in Pittsburgh, we were not to be rushed.  I have been in Bar Marco once for an event and I got to sample their drinks. Just as before, the drinks at brunch were amazing. I love any bar that focuses on natural ingredients and bitters, and that does them well. This place is a great addition to the Strip - in fact, I'd argue that it's the best restaurant in the Strip, bar none (not meant to be a pun there ...)",

The food is delicious and Chef is always cooking up something new! The menu changes seasonally and caters to local availability.  You can eat upstairs in their bar room or downstairs for a special 6 course meal. Their wine selection is limited but impeccable (it's paired with current dishes) and their no-menu bar/bartenders are phenomenal... just tell them what you like and they will whip something up. (For example, A \"bourbon + citrus\" order is my favorite). Also love that they pay their staff a salary - menu items are priced accordingly as tip is included. The staff is wonderful and rounds out the experience beautifully. Highly recommended for Brunch or Dinner!!",

This guy needs to find a job where he is not waiting on people. He made multiple mistakes by not getting something we ordered and blamed us for it. His reply was. \" I didn't realize you wanted that.\" He refused to recommend anything, as he stated, \" I have no idea what you like so it would be impossible for me to recommend something\"  He was argumentative about everything. Every time we asked a question he came back with some smart ass answer. I can only assume that he's like this all the time because he was so accustomed to being disrespectful. He told us that the items are larger as you go down the menu from top to bottom. My 14 year old daughter said, \"Dad my salad was bigger than my dinner.\" He told us that the Caesar Salad was an Authentic Caesar Salad and the anchovies could not be removed. Ok great I get that, but the salad is nothing like an Authentic Caesar Salad. My Father was serving table side Caesar Salads in his restaurants since the 60's, the whole deal with egg, evoo, garlic, Dijon, etc. and let me tell you this was not an authentic Caesar. Maybe a stab at a new hip take on an Authentic Caesar with a swing and miss. There was so much anchovies in this thing you might as well call it an Anchovies Salad. I asked the server about the temperature perpetration for my steak and if their medium would still have a pink center. With a smirk reply he responded but of coarse. I ended up receiving a well done steak with Zero pink. It looked like it sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes. The dessert was good! Then, at 6:15pm the server told us that we had to leave because the table was booked for a 6:45pm reservation. We were like ok.... we've been waiting for you to bring us the check. I think he just wanted to get another stab in before we left. A long story short I went to Bar Marco for my Birthday Dinner and was treated like crap by a rude condescending server.

    "text": "I came back to BM for a friends B-day celebration.  It was a party of 8 or so people. My gripe is the price points for the quality.  Now before you call me a \"chincy Pittsburgher\", I have ate and drank in many fine establishments from NYC to Chi town to New Orleans and every where in between.   BM is good per se, but its quickly becoming Ibiza-esque in that its over priced tapas that is trying to capitalize on the unique trend of small plates and \"craft\" cocktails.   I ordered one whiskey concoction, one glass of wine and some bacon wrapped dates. My girlfriend ordered an amaretto sour, and a gin concoction.  The Amaretto sour was about the only drink that was unique and delicious. The rest were really just so-so. Bacon wrapped dates, as always, are delcious. They had a miniscule amount of manchego cheese, however.  This brings me to my issue. Bacon wrapped dates are 10 dollars. With the sparse amount of Manchego, they are probably better suited to a price point of 6.   The cocktails for the most part were mediocre and priced at 10-12 dollars. The Ameretto Sour was the only place close to that. Try an 8 dollar price point.  I can get better Tapas and Drinks for a much more reasonable price at Tamari. Better yet, try the Headkeeper in Greensburg, where I went the next day. Granted, its a suburb, but everything there is impeccable for similar prices to BM, with larger portions.  I wonder how many of the customers are repeats, or simply first timers enamored with the uniqueness of the place.   I wish BM all the success in the world, but I can spend 80 dollars or so elsewhere for much better food and drink.",

Gave the bartender some vague guidance but mostly let him do what he wanted, which turned out great.   Menu changes frequently but for what it's worth, the pig head croquettes were exceptional, the kale and faro salad was very good, and the rigatoni bolognese was \"merely\" good.   My only complaint is that the rigatoni fell victim to the trend of serving pasta too al dente to the point of just being kind of chewy. But the sauce was on point with deep but subtle flavor and nice fall spices, which were complimented by a bourbon drink featuring similar spice notes.",

Didn't want to order more because 1 drink, 1 soup, 1 patatas bravas, 1 walleye, and 1 quail had already put us over 50 bucks and the taste definitely did not live up to its price.

    "text": "I've been to Bar Marco twice, and was waiting for the third experience to write my review in the hope that they would change my opinions of them.  I had planned on trying out the Wine Room for my birthday and got in touch with the restaurant via email months in advance to reserve the room.  I gave my credit card to reserve the room and then a few weeks later, checked in with the restaurant to confirm my reservation.  Alas, they had lost my booking and the manager wrote me a rather unapologetic email stating that there had been a mixup, and please would I be interested in another weekend?  It took me a number of days to get anyone to even attempt to call me, and when I tried to return the phone call, nobody called me back.  So, I have given up on Bar Marco. For good.  Why did they need redemption in the first place?  Yes, they make good food, but that isn't enough to make a restaurant good.  The service is extremely spotty - on both occasions, we waited at least 30 minutes for cocktail orders from the bar.  The last time, the drinks were delivered without so much as a bat of a lash at the amount of time that had elapsed, not to mention the fact that some of our appetizers had already come and gone.  We drank them hastily, not because they were particularly creative or outstanding, but because we were all thirsty and kind of annoyed.  The rest of dinner was what I imagine is status quo for the restaurant: loud, rushed, and underseasoned.  I won't be going back to Bar Marco by choice.  I wanted to give them a last chance, but they blew it.  I can only hope that Livermore is managed a little better and has more expeditious service.",

The servers are salaried employees so tipping is not a part of the dining experience.  The coffee was exceptional, served with brown organic sugar cubes and cream in adorable glass coffee cups.   Our server was friendly and very knowledgable regarding the menu. Cocktails were tailored to flavor profiles concocted by my friends at the table.   To start, we split an order of the Nutella french toast and it was amazing. The perfect fix to a sweet tooth craving.   I ordered a burger cooked medium well, it was served with a mix of greens.   We were all very impressed with the service and the food. I'd highly recommend this place to friends.",

They are trying way too hard to be too cool for school without even remotely being able to pull it off.   We were in town from Brooklyn (and therefore very familiar with the type of place Bar Marco aspires to be) and had heard great things. We tried to call ahead but nobody picked up the phone because they are too self-consciously hip to take reservation the normal way (\"send us a text and we'll reply within 24hours\" - wtf kind of reservation system is that?)   We arrived to a half-empty room and were kept waiting at the bar with the promise of a table \"within 15-20mins\" - no problem, happy to wait. A full hour and 10mins later (during which 3 two-tops had been sitting empty THE WHOLE TIME with waiters skulking around looking clueless) we were told they couldn't accommodate us but we could eat at the bar, which is way too narrow to eat comfortably.   Dudes, we could have finished our whole dinner at any of the three tables by now! You're a casual bar, not some white-glove 3-Star Michelin place, just put the plates down on the table and quit acting like anyone should consider themselves lucky to be able to spend money here.   Bottom line: like many a place with good press they've since fallen into the trap of believing their own hype and are now in the attitude business rather than the hospitality business. But acting all snooty doesn't quite work when half your tables are sitting empty - that's called an incompetent front of house crew. Get your shit together Kevin - seriously disappointing.",

We didn't pay attention to the time but just walked in since we saw people sitting at the bar. Even though it was a small, \"early private even't the server welcomed us in and we sat ourselves in the corner, specifically in the spot featured in Matt O's photo-the bright sun felt nice but was REALLY bright. We ordered two drinks and they were delicious-fresh, strong and complex. Had the meatballs and they were okay (meatball snob)-fresh marinara, it seemed ...but here's the thing. Martin J's recent review is very interesting to me and not really all that surprising.   While sitting there I noticed books on the little bookcase beside us-old books. For a place that serves food and drink this rubbed me the wrong way. Next up I had to go the bathroom, which was a mess. If I remember correctly the ceiling fan had so much dust in it I was waiting for a spark. Plus, our server had the giggles. And why is that building standing by itself....  So, when I'm paying $12 for a drink (and YES, they are exceptional-SHUT UP!) I expect my surroundings to also be exceptional. At least the bartender had a well-kept handlebar mustache....",

The server really knew his stuff, probing our tastes to help recommend wine and then food. The sommelier came by to check how we liked the wine and was clearly smart and into his job. Both the server and the sommelier knew when to check in and when to leave us alone.   The gemelli beef sugo was rich and to die for. The pan seared chicken with the black beans was out of this world (and let's be honest, why order chicken when you're out at a nice place, right?  It's usually gonna be dry and bland, but nooooo, this amazed.  The beet greens with some sort of cheesy thing on top was delicious. And our dessert (chocolate + coffee, which sounds like just chocolate and coffee, but it's not!), which we split, was a perfect wrap up for the meal.   Not cheap but not too pricey. A little noisy and close to other customers (depending on your table) but the service and the food propped these issues up to 5 stars, no question. We'll be back.",

We ordered cocktails, which took a bit to make, but were all delicious and inventive, well worth the extra wait.   For my meal I ordered shrimp with polenta and chili oil. The chili oil was bland, but the polenta was great and the shrimp were large. My friend ordered the shirred eggs, it came with potatoes, bacon, and a creamy beschemel sauce... it was bomb. I wish I ordered that instead. If you see it on the menu, just order it. One more thing I noticed about the food: it was hot! All of it! That really impressed me.  The service was ok. The server came around often enough, but was a bit too touchy-feely for my taste, but he was attentive and knowledgable. We had 4 people in our reservation and they had to push two two-tops together, but one still had people sitting in it, so they sat two of us in the one table and waited til the other got up, then pushed them together. It was weird. Besides the service, I'll be back plenty of times. The food and the cocktails were great.  And one last thing: the playlist was outstanding! Outkast, Busta Rhymes, even Dead Prez \"Hip Hop\" played. Before the drinks and the food came, I knew I wanted to come back over and over based on the music selection.",

We were extremely disappointed. For one thing, it was absolutely freezing downstairs. It was very cold outside that day & unfortunately it was also very cold on the inside. So cold that three of my friends wore their coats the entire time we were in there. It was awful.   There was no menu so we asked the waiter what we were getting. The waiter had NO idea. He had not a clue what the chef was making that night. It took him 20 minutes to explain that there were four appetizers & two entrees to pick from while he tried to recall the ingredients. If the wait staff doesn't know what's going on, maybe you do need to have an actual menu?  Apparently Bar Marco doesn't have a drink menu. The waiter named four drinks, wasn't sure of the ingredients, but recommended two of them. I had a Dr. Cooper. It was delicious. However, there was less than two inches of actual drink in my glass & the cost, I found out later, was $12. Thank the lord I didn't order several. It was about $8 overpriced.   For dinner I got a pasta dish with vegetables. It was good, but nothing special. It wasn't very large either. And it was $15. My friend then asked what was for dessert & we were told, \"nothing\". Great.   The freezing cold air & the ridiculously overpriced drinks killed it for me. Add in the clueless water, the mediocre food & the complete lack of decor & I can't imagine I will come back here anytime soon.",

I got the fried chicken, and it was flavorless. My friend had the burger, and it was very average. Cinnamon pull-apart bread was very good, but I think it's hard to screw up a cinnamon roll.  The alcoholic coffee (can't remember the name of it) was recommended by the waitress and was NASTY. Do NOT get it- I drank about two sips of it and let it sit there.  Honestly, for what you pay, everything just seemed so incredibly average. Even the way the food is presented... There's just nothing special about it. I will say that if I had to go again, I would try the pancakes or the corque BLT because they both looked amazing.

A quaint location, exceptional quaffed cocktails, a wine cellar just opened last summer, $5 Monday night no menu to feature local chefs and a $5 Tuesday drink special to go along with it and their innovative forward thinking 'no tipping' policy.  Every event I attend in the city they serve the most fabulous food bites which always makes me want to come back.  BUT!!!  Each time I do I just cannot get passed the cloud of arrogance that surrounds the wait and barstaff! It is beyond frustrating. I have tried this multiple times, with my happy hour group, with my best friend and her husband [who were beyond excited to try this place - more on this later] or as a social event for a CMU end of Semester celebration.   For some of the experiences:  The party was a rigamarole. Back and forth 5 thousand times for the date and the space, despite being helping from a few good friends of the restaurant. The space was delightful but practically out of my Social Chair budget. I negotiated hard but ended up footing a lot of the bill on my own [I don't blame the restaurant for this - that was the fault of my attendees] However, the staff was flippant as if it pained them to wait on us. And the food they served us was mediocre. Apparently your dollar here is judged as if this was NYC. The mood rubbed off majorly on my guests despite the highly anticipated experience.  The visit with my couple friends was disappointing in another way. The reservation policy is very strict and the small space makes the wait long and they are booked quickly. I had been asked to join my friends after they had a delightful experience with one of the staff member who also works at Rock Bottom and they sincerely excited to go. I held my tongue on previous experiences and joined them. I had not known they had not made a reservation [this was not passed along] so the waiter promptly told us that we had to wait but were welcome to occupy the standing space until something became available. We ordered a drink which took a good 10 minutes to arrive [it wasn't THAT packed] and again seemed upset when we had to remind him about our order. The rambled off a custom drink which was was nowhere near the sour types that I usually drink [preferred style - bitter does not equal sour]. We eventually sat at very low tables and when asked for a refill received a look of disgust when my friend's husband declined for driving reasons. Instead of a reorder we decided to leave.  I am beyond upset about continued disappointment from this restaurant. Note - this is just this particular barstaff when they 'rotate' to their sister location at the Livermore [see other review] they magically transform. The wait is still there [this has other reasons] but the attitude simmers away. I will continue to wait for a decent experience.",

The perfect cider donuts with a light caramel sauce and sweet cream on the side  (a must), the flaky scones with a pear butter that was also fantastic with the donuts. The croissant was excellent and the quiche was among the best I've had ever (phenomenal crust and whipped eggs which created a light and airy quiche to be sought after).  I enjoyed the espresso bacon burger for brunch today. Awesome! I have never had a burger for brunch, and with all the sweet and savory samples we tried, I thought I would explore beyond my norm for brunch. It was an appropriate size and made precisely to my desire (finished medium). Everyone ordered something different and all of it looked great. The service was attentive and knowledgable about the menu as well as the sourcing of the ingredients.  The menus are seasonal and reflect what is available locally at the time of your visit.  And visit you must!  I would recommend adding at least one vegan option for people who have dietary restrictions to round out the menu, but I couldn't reduce your stars on that account alone since it doesn't effect me, but one of my party enjoyed a mimosa rather than eat due to this issue. She didn't ask about any off menu options to accommodate her situation so I can't blame the restaurant or fault the staff for that. I would guess that the kitchen staff would have whipped up something delicious for her had she troubled them with the question.",

    "text": "I visited Bar Marco this past Sun. for the first meeting of the PGH brunch club.  I'd heard good things about the brunch here, so it seemed like a solid choice for our first meeting, despite some scheduling mishaps.  Drink-wise, we were given a complimentary half glass of rose cavo, which made for a nice start.  For brunch, there is a drink menu that contains some classic and some specialty hair of the dog drinks.  As someone who often prefers the novel to the familiar, I decided to try one of the specialty drinks--specifically, the initial morning, because it contained mint (I love mint-flavored drinks) and our waitress recommended it.  Although I forget what type of alcohol this drink has (I don't believe it was rum--but I could be wrong), it reminded me of a mojito, given that it contained lime and club soda in addition to the mint.  It was quite strong and refreshing, and I'd recommend it if as a brunch cocktail, particularly if you like mojitos.  Food-wise, after perusing the menu, I decided to go with the mussels.  They are served with spinach garnishes, as well as a white wine sauce and potatoes.  The mussels and potatoes were cooked well (tender, not over- or undercooked), and the broth gave the dish a pleasant savory flavor.  I felt that the portion was decent--between the mussels and potatoes, it filled me up just enough, but not too much.  My one qualm with this dish is that it's not served with bread to soak up the broth.  In fact, I asked my waitress for bread (which I would have paid an upcharge for), and she checked but said none was available, and that the chef said the potatoes were for soaking up the broth.  Although I do happen to be a scientist with a terminal degree, you don't need me to tell you that potatoes don't have the absorption capability of bread! Even our waitress recognized this, saying \"it's not the same\" when telling me what the chef's response to my bread request.  Because I didn't want to waste the broth, I asked for a spoon, which they brought me, and I used to eat the remaining broth.  However, given the intensity of its flavor, it would have been much better if I'd had some bread to soak it up!  Service was fine--not great, but not bad, either.  During the day, the ambiance is quite bright, which works well for a brunch spot--I wonder how it is at night, though. My one complaint is that we were seated at the table by the door (not my choice), and despite that there was a curtain, every time the door opened, I was subjected to a draft of frigid air, which necessitated keeping my jacket on.  Overall, despite the lack of bread, I was favorably impressed by the quality of drink and food here.  I'll have to return at happy hour to try their normal offerings. 4.5 stars.",

I've wanted to make it down to this quaint establishment in the Strip for some time, but had just not found the right time until last night - glad I did! When we arrived, our waiter explained that the mixologists generally prefer that the patrons inform them of their desired base spirit, and that they will then make a hand-crafted mixed drink based on that preference, rather than the usual card menu of standard cocktails. They are big into using the freshest ingredients here, including house-made juices, mixers, and even have their own tonic for their G&T's.  Ambience was good - although the attractive patterned ceiling did little to mute out the loudness of the music and conversations. The wait staff were friendly and efficient, offering nice suggestions for each person in our party after hearing our preferences. We had the fried smelts (yum!!), patatas bravas (yum!), bacon wrapped dates, and charcuterie plate to pick on while we enjoyed our beverages. All were tasty and well-presented.  Overall, I agree with the people who have told me about how much they enjoy Bar Marco, and will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "Last Friday we were able to score a last minute reservation at Bar Marco and I'm so glad we did! When Googling \"Best Cocktails in Pittsburgh\" or \"Must-Do Restaurants\", Bar Marco shows up on a number of lists, so naturally it made our \"Weekend Restaurants List\".  The atmosphere is extremely quaint and authentic to the original firehouse it used to be. All the staff (who are salaried by the way) were friendly, prompt, and so informative of the menu, especially Dom, who manages their small but great wine list. I opted for a delicious Rose while my boyfriend experimented with \"Bartender's Choice\" and different whiskeys - both were excellent 3 glasses later.  Food wise: We started with the Focaccia, which was absolutely delicious and the Arancini, which was meh. The arancini balls were filled with yellow spanish rice and in ours for some reason, no beef ragu like the menu stated. The San Marzano tomato sauce that accompanied the arancini was flavorful, but they don't measure up to True italian arancini.  For dinner, I got the Spinach Gnudi which in look and texture was similar to pale green play-doh balls. The texture is quite interesting and way more dough-y than gnocchi with little to no flavor. Probably wouldn't get this again. The other entree we tried was the hanger steak, again good but nothing I'd rave about after leaving the restaurant.  Overall: a great place to knock off the list if you enjoy being creative with your cocktails or want a light meal - stick to the apps and shared pasta dishes.",

    "text": "The pros: Smart, clean atmosphere in a renovated firehouse. Excellent focaccia for a starter. Good drinks.  Cons: The service. Had it not been for the condescending server (and the atrocious dessert, sesame semifreddo, that resembled dried out halvah) Bar Marco would have received 3 stars. It began by the server telling our group of 4 that arrived at 6 PM that we had to be out by 7:30 b/c our table was reserved; the restaurant was half empty at 6 so we could have easily been seated at another table. (At 8 PM, when we walked back to our car after visiting the Strip District, Bar Marco had only a handful of customers. No one was at the table at which we had sat.) The server answered my question of \"Do you serve small plates, tapas?\" with \"we HATE the term 'tapas.' the chef calls them medium plates.\" Chastised, my friends and I ordered 5 medium plates. After placing our order, the server said we should have ordered 2 plates per person, information that would have been helpful when I first inquired about plate size.   As I don't eat meat, I asked if a sausage could be held or if it was already blended into the dish, a dish that I wouldn't have necessarily ordered but was put on the spot to order more food. No, every ingredient in the food was \"essential.\" Traditionally, if a restaurant doesn't allow ingredients to be withheld or substituted, this is stated on the menu. Likewise, if a chef recommends ordering more than 1 plate per person or if the plate size differs from the norm, the customers are told this up front. Not a huge deal but the patronizing way that the information was conveyed was. (Also, as an FYI, 5 shared dishes would be enough food for 4 people. We didn't come close to finishing what we'd ordered.)   Fast forward to 1 of the 3 dessert options, toffee pudding. Apparently it should have been labeled pear pudding b/d the server informed us that pear, the last ingredient listed, was, again, an \"essential ingredient\" prepared three ways so to withhold it would ruin the dessert. So, we had the $12 sesame semifreddo, which was so unappealing that each of us took just one sample bite and left the rest.     As an aside, I grew around Pittsburgh and had always raved to my East Coast friends what a friendly, kind city it was. I visited Bar Marco with friends who had never been to the 'burgh and I was eager to show them how hip while nice Pittsburgh was. This was not the introduction that they received.",

We liked it so much we had to come back for the following Tuesday.   Tuesday nights some of their menu items are $6 including their nifty cocktails and the Marco Burger. It was busy both nights, so if you decide to make a trip plan on making it an evening.   Seating is a quaint room with tables and a small bar with dim lighting and candlelight. The edges of the room are lined with various wine bottles and a couple choice art pieces. Music is usually playing as well. Definitely a cool vibe for a night out with friends.   The service is awesome, the staff are friendly and seem to genuinely care that you enjoy every part of your experience.   The food- you can't come here without trying the Marco burger, one of the tastiest burgers I've eaten. The beef was juicy, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. The patatas bravas were great as a side to share with the table as well.  The cocktails- you can definitely come here and make an evening trying their different cocktails. They have a rotating cocktail menu and make sure to pack a punch. If you can, try the Bees Knees and The Bitter End.   I may just become a regular here.",

The entree portion sizes are too small.  Or they need an additional timbale, or serving of puree, or something.  We shared the skate, and it was meager.  Tasty, but meager.  And on a plate that was of a size more appropriate for an appetizer.  The other things we ordered were delicious.  The octopus, arancini, and brussels sprouts were excellent.  The desserts are genius.  The service was disappointing.  Dishes were not cleared (I had to ask).  We were not escorted to our table (until I asked him to take us there), we were going to be seated at an unappealing table near the stairs (though there were lots of open tables), and it took 15 minutes for a cocktail to appear (despite not being busy).  Come on, guys.  I'm very glad they pay their staff a decent wage (they don't accept gratuities).  But that needs to translate to good service for the customers.  I did not feel that I received very good service.  Not terrible, but it was noticeable and annoying.",

By the time, we left, it was packed - and with good reason.   This was a spectacular meal all the way around.  The service was informative and attentive - but not hovering.  The drinks - one where you could pick the spirit (vodka), bubbly, berry, herb and simple syrup and one with rum, aperol and some other fruity stuff - were perfection.    Since this is a tapas place - despite sometimes reading like it's not - we decided to split everything.  We started with the bay scallops which arrived with a pea smear.  The scallops were plump, perfectly cooked and just a hint of salt.  Next came the bucatini with lobster, chili, mint and butter.  The combo was delicious and simple.  Next we split the steak and frites and pork and fingerlings/carrots.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the presentation, sauces and flavor.   We didn't stay for dessert, but I am sure we would have been equally as pleased.   We came here originally because everyone is on salary - no tips allowed.  More businesses should follow their lead.  But left happy about the business and the food!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Sunday morning for brunch with my wife.  Bar Marco had been on my Yelp bookmarks for quite awhile so whenever my wife and I found ourselves in the strip with some free time, we decided to check it out.  We got to the restaurant around 10:40 and were told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait.  Since there is not much room to wait they actually take down your cell number and will give you a call whenever your table is ready.  I enjoyed this quite a bit as you can easily waste time in the strip and its better than standing around inside a restaurant waiting for a table.  At just before 11, we arrived back at the restaurant and they had our table ready for us.  For my brunch entree I decided on going with the Bar Marco burger, medium, while my wife went with the butternut squash soup and the Fried Chicken. My Bar Marco burger consisted of espresso, rosemary aioli, bacon and onion with a small side salad.  It ended up tasting pretty good even though I didn't really get any flavor of espresso coming through.  The rosemary aoili and onion (it almost seemed like an onion marmalade) kept the perfectly cooked burger moist and the bacon added just the right amount of saltiness.  I was also able to grab one of the pieces of my wife's fried chicken.  The breading on the outside of it was crispy and great tasting while the inside was still moist and juicy.  The black pepper gravy that came on it also gave it a nice little bite that I enjoyed.  My wife was also a fan of the chicken although she enjoyed her butternut squash soup even more.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  While I thought that the food was a little overpriced for what you got (I would have loved to see more substantial side items with the entrees), I still enjoyed everything that I tasted here.",

It's truly a wonderful way to celebrate any special occasion. This review is just for the wine tasting dinner (the 10-12 course one not the 4 course earlier seating). We did not have a chance to try out the bar since we knew we would have plenty to drink. A note about the general ambiance upstairs. The ceilings are exceptionally tall (it's a converted fire house) so it is definitely noisy upstairs. Be advised that it is loud but in an upbeat exciting way.  Justin and Justen were great. They kept us very well informed on everything we were eating and drinking that evening and answered any questions we had. They were fantastic.  The ambiance in the basement is lovely. At no point did you feel like you were in a dark dank basement. The air was clear and not damp at all and the room was wonderfully lot with candles. It was a fantastic temperature and very comfortable.  Dinner was out of this world. I truly can't say enough about the exciting and innovative dishes we were served. Not to mention that Chef Jamilka knows when to let the beauty of something simple shine through (our first of the season heirloom tomatoes were divine). She was so warm and welcoming and came down several times to explain the food and answer any questions. The menu changes seasonally so what we had that night would be completely different the next. I can't wait to return for another evening come this fall! Worth every penny and for the generous pours, I'd even go so far as to call this evening a bit of a bargain for all the courses and wine!",

    "text": "My daughter and I were trying to decide where to eat dinner last night. She went to the Pittsburgh Magazine website and looked at their list. She picked out a couple places that we wanted to try. We chose a restaurant in the Strip, since we were first going to Lawrenceville. As we drove past our first choice, we saw the line out the door and down the street. Waiting was not an option for our stomachs on this night. We pulled off so she could make another choice. She said Bar Marco, but it's pricier. OK, we'll splurge. We backtracked up the street and found it. It was about 5 PM, and the place was empty except for a couple people at the bar and one table of patrons. We did not have a reservation but were seated. We sat one table away from steps going to the 2nd floor. The menu was small which can be helpful in making selections. Too much choice can be overwhelming. We decided to start with arancini and the focaccia. The arancini was delicious with a tasty sauce. The focaccia was also quite good, although the dipping olive oil was strong for my taste.  For the entree, my daughter ordered the pork loin with brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. She told me I could have the brussels sprouts. What I got was one small taste. She said they didn't taste cabbagey, and ate them all. She told the server she was now a fan of their brussels sprouts. I ordered the rigatoni with beef shank. It was cooked perfectly 'al dente' with the sauce of that beef shank. I would have liked just a bit more juice in the sauce. My daughter insisted I try a bite of her sweet potatoes before they were gone. They were just the right sweetness and flavor to meld with the pork loin. We actually did not share meals at all, just a taste. The portions for entrees are much smaller than we may be accustomed to, but they really are just the right size. They fill but do not overfill. We just get used to equating bigger size with greater value. Even though I had some leftovers to take home (trying to make that trip to the gym earlier in the day mean something), we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu was short. My daughter and I decided to share a dessert, so we went with her first choice-the pistachio cake with a cup of Commonplace coffee. I joked with our server that years ago I made a pistacihio cake with a cake mix and box of pistachio pudding. She laughed and replied that it would be just like that. It was delivered by another server who explained each element of the presentation. Despite its small appearance, again it was just enough for the two of us after our meal. We ate each bite with a piece of other plate elements (pear gelee, florentine cookie, dot of raspberry sauce, the cream and pistachios). We were not disappointed in any of the food we ordered here. If I could change something on the menu, it would be to offer a couple 'normal' drinks. My daughter wanted a soda, but they had only handcrafted sodas. I asked about iced tea, but that also was not an offering. I ordered a handcrafted lemon drink which was a bit too gingery. The server did take it back to sweeten a bit. She was very accommodating and helpful.   We struck up a conversation with a couple who came in after us and were seated at the table at the bottom of the long staircase leading to the second floor. The stairs offered a mysterious air to the space. What's up there? It was this couple's first time also at Bar Marco. They ordered the osso buco and the bucatini & lobster. They told us they were both happy with their choices. We were a step ahead of them, so they saw our dessert arrive. They watched our reaction to that first taste, and then asked about it.  We assured them it was delicious and the other choices were probably good too. For them watching us gave more evidence of the experience of fellow diners.    The space here is small and not fancy. I noticed our fellow diner look at the chips on the pasta bowl, and then realized my bowl was also chipped. Earlier I noticed the glasses at the table beside us did not match. I assume these things are deliberate in the presentation. The ceiling is high and the door opens from the street to the dining area. The entrance is encased by heavy curtains hanging on steel pipe. There is just enough opening in those curtains to enter the main dining area. This rigging helps to protect diners from that cold air burst as the front door opens. Still I felt a draft and sat with my coat around my shoulders during the meal. The diners at that table next to the steps mentioned a draft from that staircase also.    My daughter and I enjoyed every bite of our meals, and we plan to return again on a splurge. Perhaps next trip it will be for brunch. .",

    "text": "Dinner tonight was really pleasant, starting from the rose sampling we were offered upon arriving just because, as our waiter told us, \"Rose is fun!\" Our opening dish was the arancini, which was delicately fried and plated on top of a truly delicious pork ragu. The pate board was flavorful with some clever accouterments (sweet apple butter, savory whipped butter, and aggressively pickled red onions are among the most memorable). The Marco Burger at $12 would be worth $21+ in New York; while it is undeniably tasty, I'm a purist when it comes to burgers (aka the simple the better). For me, the burger's thick cut bacon gets in the way of experiencing the patty, espresso, and rosemary aioli. We also ordered the patatas bravas that came drizzled with a sharp chili aioli.   Service was welcoming and low-key. Try to avoid getting seated next to the door when the temperature is low because the curtains that block the door do little to block the cold drafts that swoop in. Will be coming back to take further advantage of all the smart innovating that Bar Marco has been up to! (P.S Bar Marco's \"no-tip\" policy begins in April 2015.)",

We went for brunch and when we first ordered the bloody Mary's when it arrived, the drink didn't have all of the 'ornaments' that you're used to seeing, so you think quickly to yourself 'maybe that's not gonna taste so good' but then you take a sip and you realize all those ornaments are just for fun and this is the real deal! I love the menu is small to me that means they are all going to excellent choices and you simply cannot go wrong. I was right! The crossaint as are baked in house and who can say no to that!   I cannot wait to go for dinner, and the only downside is that I had not been here sooner. Someone really should have pushed me into go ages ago!   Kudos to this restaurant for really doing Pittsburgh right!",

    "text": "My favorite part about Bar Marco was the \"bartenders choice\" of the drink list. They have a lot of great wine and cocktail options as it is, but there is so much fun and excitement in picking your spirit and flavors and seeing what the bartender comes up with just for you. If the drink he made me wasn't so unique and custom, it would be my new go-to at any bar.  The bartender himself and our waitress were so knowledgable and friendly. The food is smaller plates, which they tell you ahead of time, but the prices are a little on the higher side--this may be okay because they don't accept gratuity, and this is factored into the price of the food.  The menu typical rotates, but the waitress said they make their pasta and bread all in-house which is a nice touch.  We did make a reservation as other previous reviewers had suggested, but there was plenty of space to sit on this Friday evening.",

I found the service to be up to par and very accommodating. Our reserved table was still occupied when we first arrived. The server greeted us, apologized a couple of times for the wait, and offered us drinks while we waited.  The food was pretty good, but not the most amazing I've ever had. The bacon appetizer was delicious and all three of us were happy with our brunch entrees- soft scrambled eggs, lemon pancakes, and baked eggs. I would return to try dinner.",

Since they have been recently popping up in my twitter / instagram feed I thought I would check them out again for dinner. The night was fantastic! We sat at the bar even thought there were available tables. The bar area was really comfortable and still intimate, and this is from someone who usually doesn't love to eat \"dinner\" at the bar. The Service was great. I apologize for not remembering the bartenders name  (on my new year's list of thing I would like to work on... I obviously need to put in more effort with that one) because she is amazing and you will not be disappointed if you get a drink from her. I love that they do not have drink menus  but instead find out what flavor profiles you like and create custom drink for you.   After nailing my drink I decided to ask her about the 2 different options I was debating on. One of them was the octopus. She had previously suggested the squid and then said either one ( Octopus or Squid) would be a great choice. The squid was wonderful and cooked to perfection, the star of the dish were the little calamari pieces all over. They were lightly breaded ,fried and MELTED in your mouth. Seriously AMAZING!  I also tried a bite of ravioli option. They were good, I am just slightly jaded when it comes to raviolis and Gnocchi's. They did have great flavor and the ricotta was very nice.   So overall a great place for dinner with friends or a date!  P.S. Have you seen their Happy hour menu they have right now?! If I can make it there one night by 6, I will definitely being trying that soon!",

My least favorite part was the actual meal. I got the gnocchi. It came with like 10 gnocchi, which I would understand if it was super delicious and gourmet, but it was just fine. My friends got the ragu and agreed it was a tiny mediocre dish. We ended up going to d'enoias down the street after to get a side of bread because we were so hungry and disappointed with dinner. Maybe it is good for drinks, but the food was overpriced, limited, and not worth it. If going to dinner would recommend plenty of other delicious Italian places in Pittsburgh",

The food is good, though the aioli on the patatas bravas was too think and looked like cheese whiz. The sommelier was super enthusiastic about her job, which was nice. The other service was terrible though. Our server seemed unconcerned that we only had one plate for a table of three, and when we asked for more it took a full minute for her to provide them, even though our table was literally four feet from the bar. She was unable to articulate the difference between the $10 and $20 charcuterie plate (common sense would say the answer is \"more food\" but she was unable to come up with even that phrase, instead stumbling over her answer before producing, \"a bigger plate\"). Our check was wrong once...twice...three times, and each time we flagged this for them it took several minutes for them to produce a new one - again, even though the bar and register were right there.   The vibe was nice and the setting, though small, is funky. I might go back.",

The cocktails are top-notch and the selection of spirits is broad. We did a lot of sampling from the menu and pretty much everything we ate was delicious. The only awkward part of the tapas-style menu is that we had no clue how much food to order. Don't get me wrong, the staff was helpful and did not mind when we ordered additional items after our first batch -- it seems that's what's expected -- but it just made us feel a little adrift in the menu, not really understanding how large the portions were and how many things we should decide on.  It probably does a brain good to periodically reevaluate what constitutes a meal.  On a logistical note, the menu changes all the time, and different members of our party had different versions of the menu. The server did not seem extremely concerned when we informed her of this. Luckily, no one tried to order anything that wasn't actually available that day. We liked everything we ordered. I've already returned once for cocktails at the bar. Also, as far as dessert goes, get the olive oil cake if they have it that day! One of the tastiest desserts ever!",

    "text": "I rarely give a 5 star rating, so congrats to Bar Marco!!  It takes a special combination of delicious food, unique drinks, and a welcoming, warm atmosphere to create a dining experience that makes you want to come back for more...and Bar Marco's got it!The menu changes frequently, but based on the last few reviews, you can order just about anything and be extremely pleased.  To start, we sampled the cocktails.  With a hint of crushed red pepper, the gimlet tequila is outstanding; another hit was the chartreuse- an aromatic concoction of yellow chartreuse liqueur and thyme.  For snacks, we decided to get one of everything... and everything was incredibly tasty. The patatas bravas,  which were crisp oven baked potatoes, were drizzled with an amazing smoky sauce that we all wanted to take home with us.  A message to the chefs of Bar Marco: please mass produce and distribute this, thanks! Another must try is the arancini with vodka sauce-- delicious crisp balls of creamy risotto and one of the restaurant's signature dishes.   We also sampled the sausage and polenta (creamy polenta and spicy sausage), fritto misto (lightly battered, fried, and deliciously seasoned veggies), greens and beans (kale and cannellini beans in a tasty broth served with crostini), and the fall meatballs (wonderfully seasoned, melt in your mouth good).  We then decided to split the Ribeye with chimichurri, which was beautifully cooked...I'm still dreaming about this one.  As several have already mentioned, this is definitely a place to take your time, enjoy the food, enjoy the drinks, and enjoy the company you share the experience with :)  For now, it seems that seating is limited, so if you're thinking of trying this place out before it gets insanely busy-making reservations is a good idea!!",

    "text": "This is the kind of place I've been searching for in Pittsburgh since moving back after living in a couple other cities....great wine, excellent cocktails, friendly staff and amazing food all in a very cool space. I love a quaint bar where you can sit and enjoy all kinds of fantastic wine (or cocktails) and delicious food while having great conversation with the folks behind the bar. Run, don't walk, to Bar Marco.",

    "text": "The service and atmosphere at Bar Marco was more than awesome!  The staff was incredibly personable, and the drinks were some of the most unique combinations I've seen in Pittsburgh. My Gimlet with tequila was delicious! The \"snacks\" that we enjoyed were amazing and prepared perfectly. The carrots and mushrooms in the frito miso were the best beer battered anythings I've ever had. I'd expect that this place is going to be extremely hard to get into in a month or two. Go now! And experience how great this place is. I'm going back for sure! Thanks guys!",

    "text": "Oh, please. Might be a good place for drinks, but it was a bust for brunch. When you occupy an historic building you might think you go for a look that's either charming or edgy, and Bar Marco is neither. Tables are small, chairs not all that comfortable, the servers lean toward pretense and away from professionalism -- flatware but no napkins? Who does that? My friend asked for decaf and got a \"no\" dripping with sarcasm, as if to say, \"we don't treat our beans that way.\" On to the food: the Bloody Mary was good, if skimpy. A dish billed as fried chicken with dandelion greens, topped with a fried egg -- yeah, screw heart disease -- consisted of two overly crusted and overly fried thighs completely concealing a half-dozen threads of wilted-to-death greens. When you have guest chefs, you can't hang crap food on the kitchen because they can simply blame the guest. I know this approach is trendy but it's a bad idea because the secret of every solid restaurant is consistency, Cute idea, though, cute location, cute clientele, but if I want to eat cute, I'll trim my Chia Pet and skip Bar Marco.",
