Other foods are typical bar fare,but prepared well and enjoyable Service is speedy and attentive.  Tuesdays are sale night for wings.... a real bargain.",

    "text": "Been her twice. Once for lunch once for diner. This is a new building and therefor new and clean looking. The space is very large with two rooms. One is the main dining room and the other is the bar area. Both are huge. Both have more TVs than I could possible count. The have many high-tops in the bar area and plenty of tables and booths in the dining space. The two areas sort of run into each other without a hard wall separating the two, just a lot of TVs and booths separate. What did I eat.... well Wings! The medium buffalo wings were pretty good, but I would like them fried a bit more and not rushed out with the skin still a little less than crisply cooked. The buffalo sauce was good albeit a bit too salty for my taste. Because of this issue (to me anyway)  they are not on the top of my wings list, but good enough to have more that once. On one occasion I tried the boneless wings. I don't think I like them as well. I tried them because of not liking the skin on my last order of regular wings. But the breading was too thick and way overcooked. They could be a lot better with less breading and not cooked into a hockey puck / biscuit like rock. I think they can make good boneless wings, it might just depend on who is in the kitchen. I'll definitely try them again. I must tell you if you like fries, they are excellent here. Had them twice with similar superb results. Hot, tasty and not greasy. Also the slaw is very good; crisp, clean crunchy slaw which goes very well with the fries and wings.",

    "text": "Wing night is Tuesday for the \"traditional\" wings, which are the closest flavor to the \"originals\" at Frank and Teressa's Anchor Bar, you'll find anywhere. I think their special is .45 cent wings. Other specials throughout the week.  Great wings, friendly staff, nice open surroundings. It will even be nicer if smoking is banned from the bar area. Park around back, you might not see the BWW sign from the main road. I think there's an Applebee's out front you'll see first, but this place is worth searching for.  Order \"traditionals\", with a little sauce on the side, maybe some cheese (wedge) fries in case your tongue catches fire.  I don't want to sound like a (non-smoking) nut - but I'd like to leave an establishment and not take the smell of smoke with me on my clothes and what's left of my hair.  These are the best wings available from any national restraint or fast food chain. Go to the website and find the map to find the closest restaurant to you - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buffalowildwings.com%2F&s=5bb4a1a0ebd5c4085daf25a718f6756f00fffde07bda66ae15c8973f6e40dd58\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">buffalowildwings.com</a>  There are four in the Pittsburgh area and one in Erie. Other restaurants have opened in MD (3), NY (14), DE (3), VA (15), WV (5), NC (10), SC (4), DE (3), VA (15), TX (50+).   You ask is it worth making a trip and using $4 a gallon gas to find these restaurants. You're darn right its worth it.",

I was disappointed in the chicken, and could've bought some nuggets at McDonalds and poured sauce over them myself for cheaper.  I guess it's something to do, for a bachelor that don't got nothing else better to do with his money!",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with \"good grief\".  I've been to this location twice: dined in once and chose take-out the other time. Both experiences were awful food and service wise.  When I dined in, my waitress was slow to bring drinks, take our order, bring refills, and so forth. When she brought out my mild traditional wings, it was a disaster. Half of my wings were drenched in sauce and the other half looked bare. And sad. I took a knife and sauced up my wings.  When I chose take-out, it was just as bad. I had to repeat my order several times over the phone. It's sad because I only had one order. I also ordered a Mango Lemonade (which is one of the most amazing drinks I've ever had) and when I asked what sizes they had, he said he didn't know but would give me an XL, which I didn't know existed. When I went to pick up my order, the XL drink was really a 20oz. cup. He said he didn't know that the specialty drinks only came in one size SO if you're dining in, order the Mango Lemonade and get your money's worth - for me. Anyway, I also ordered a side of celery and it was missing so I drove back because let me tell you, I love celery. The guy threw my celery in the bag and stared at me as if I ripped him off. I wish I had the time to stare back.  I walked out of BWW realizing I'd never return again. Unless they sent me the recipe for their Mango Lemonade.",

From the time we were seated until the time a server approached the table was 14 mins. She stated she wasn't our server but will take our drink order. Another 8 mins passed when Angela N. came over with those drinks that we had ordered from the first server.  Angela took our order & served us. She never came back to  (a) ask us how our meal is or if we needed anything (I needed condiments for my burger)  (b) offer a refill on our teas or water (we had spicy sauce & were parched) and  (c) bring our check.  Instead, we had to ask two passing servers for condiments, napkins, drink refills  & our check. That was 4 requests to 2 other servers. My spouse & I consider ourselves to be great tippers as we eat out alot. We would never stiff a server, however, we were compelled to give the other two servers Angela's tip. Angela only got 10%.  Needless to say, we were highly disappointed in the service as the restaurant was not busy & seemed fully staffed. The other 2 servers were friendly & accommodating.  The Jax, FL and Fort Walton Beach, FL B-Dubbs were great. However we will not go to store #0302 again because of the poor service.",

I poured over the menu for quite some time before landing on popcorn shrimp and slaw instead of fries.  That should do it, I thought.  Ugh... Not to be so.  The shrimp didn't resemble shrimp anymore after they deep fried it to death and then some.    I didn't mean to complain to my server but she asked.  So, I honestly said I didn't like them.  She said no problem; she'd get the manager.  He came over and handled if very well.  He very cordially offered to get me something else, to which I said very politely \"no thanks\" and I just finished my slaw.    So, why am I giving it 3 stars and not lower?  Because, I realize it IS a wings venue, after all.  I can't just go hating it because they have what they advertise.  And, both my server and the manager handled the situation with grace and the shrimp was deducted from my bill without my even asking them to do that.    Will I be back?

    "text": "I love BWW. It sounds so bad, but they are decently allergy friendly! BWW has a detailed allergen menu online and I have not had any reactions from any allergens (I'm allergic to dairy, dairy by-products, fish, and shellfish).   If you have dairy allergies, egg allergies, or seafood allergies, BWW is a good option for dining out. Yay!  I came here several times with my husband to watch a few football games (Go Hawks!) and it was a nice atmosphere with lots of families and no threat of people getting angry with one another in the restaurant with opposing teams winning or losing (i.e. You won't have to really worry about someone picking a fight with you if you're rooting for a certain team).  There are lots of large flat screen TVs situated around the restaurant, and if a certain screen isn't showing a specific game, you can ask your server to put on a specific game - just remember to give them the number of the TV screen which is on a little white sticker at the bottom left/right corner.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I always order the same thing, and I've never had any issues with cross contamination at this BWW or the BWW in Morgantown, WV. The chips and salsa are super yummy, and the chips are served warm and is large enough to serve 2-3. Sodas are also refilled constantly and the servers are pretty attentive, even when it's pretty busy.   All in all, BWW is a great place to catch a game and eat some wings with your friend, family, or significant other. ALSO, they have awesome Wi-fi and you can request for the gaming tablets if you or your kids want to play games.",

As for the food - lots of great sauce combinations, but can you really enjoy them if you're skeptical of the basic ingredient, the chicken? Not really.  The beer selection - super large tap, but very few (if any) micro-brews. BUMMER.  But! The real reason we were here - to watch the 2012 Presidential Election. And for this occasion, this place was awesome. Chill. Nonchalant. Lots of TVs. And we could each pick our own respective stations from a compilation of sources.   (Yes, I watched with my boss. And we had a swell evening.)",

The dining area is rather large and there are multiple TVs.  Anyway, Cousin and I started with the soft pretzels. They were good and came with queso and spicy mustard. I'm not in to wings (too much work), but I love chicken. We both had the chicken strips with buffalo sauce and fries. Neither of us really cared for the ranch dressing, but I need it to balance out the buffalo, so I ate it anyway. I don't usually like shoestring fries, but these are nice and crispy. Then we tried the chocolate fudge cake with ice cream (I think that's what it was called). Delicioso. But I was stuffed and couldn't eat much of it.  My only gripe is that the staff was a little TOO attentive. I know, I know. I sound like a crazy person. But between our server, her trainee, and the guy who kept asking us to give donations and sign up for the BWW club... it was a little much.  However, I'll take that over being neglected. So I'm sticking with 5 stars.",

Our server had friends sitting behind and continued to go and stand or sit and talk to them. Laughing and talking really loud about her plans that night and how she couldn't hang out, because she was going to work the WWE event. Our food finally came and she came back once to check on us and ask if we'd like anything else. We asked for our check, then had to walk around to find her.  I wasn't impressed with the server, my food was ok, and I felt it was freezing in there! The best part of course was watching the World Cup Soccer matches. Nice selection of tvs.  Would I come back, yeah, for the tvs and maybe to just get some drinks and apps.",

I happen to love BWW, but my husband, not so much, so when he suggested we eat there for dinner one night I was like \"HURRY BEFORE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND!\" :)    Anyway, our server was totally on point.  She had a really friendly, outgoing personality and her service was awesome.  My husband and I were both impressed with her.  There was also a guy going around running drinks, offering samples, etc.. I forget what he told us his title was but he got us to sign up for there emails and he did a really good job suggesting different drinks and helping us out.  At first we were a little confused because he brought the first beer sample to our table and we assumed he was the bartender because he asked us if we wanted to try something else, and when he brought THAT sample, we told him which we preferred and he told us we had to tell our server, which we didnt understand at first, but then he continued to tell us what his job was there.  OK, but maybe still just go tell our server.. it just made for a confusing, awkward 30 seconds or so.  Regardless, we finally got it and he was a really nice, helpful guy.    Our food was, in my opinion, awesome as always.  I almost always get the 10 boneless wings with 2 different sauces, celery and carrots.. pretty basic and I dont go crazy with new sauces.  In that aspect, I'm a creature of habit.. I know what I like! The hubs got whatever sandwhich they were featuring and he wasnt INLOVE with it, but then, he's hard to impress.  He liked it enough not to complain and he wasn't upset, he just wont be ordering it next time we eat there (Lord willing, haha).",

It just seems that everything is made from a freezer and thrown in the oven to cook. The last time we went here we had two different waitresses, both of room did an exceptional job with our table. We were given the opportunity to try several different samples in wing sauces that were new to the restaurant. We both enjoyed this experience, even though we did not enjoy the taste of some of the samples. This is a great place to watch the game for sure, and the main reason we decided to go here was due to the atmosphere and the big screens for games. You have to get there super early if you're there for a game, otherwise you will be parking at the hall across the street.  They really didn't have any game day specials either. For a Sunday afternoon I was expecting something more the Michelob ultra for 3.35/pop. To top it all off, the steelers lost. I am now 0-2 for playoff games at BWW. Still an okay spot to chill and watch the game.",

There are TV's everywhere; even screens inches from neighboring screens which created a strange alter viewing experience.    The service was pretty good but I don't really care for waiters that plop themselves down @ your table like you're old friends. Um, just take our order please.   The wings must be eaten that night or they get chewy and gross. You'll have to trust me.  We ordered the  Asian spicy wings, the mango habanero wings (serious emphasis on the HABANERO that blasts your tongue and lips w/ a relentless nerve dulling heat), and the salt/vinegar wings. They were all crispy and tasty but the celery/carrot side was far too small or perhaps it was because my mouth was on fire and I needed to extinguish the pain but my prayers went unanswered. Order /eat the hottest ones last or you won't taste ANY flavors that follow.   I just wasn't impressed with the decor nor the general vibe of the place. I see it as more of a wing/beer joint for tables of college or high school boys and men just back from hunting bears. Seriously, it's more of a dude kinda joint which is fine.  Their wing serving sizes are really great because you can order 6 wings w/ each flavor you choose. Nice option.   Beer was cold and there were good solid draft options.",

I enjoy their beer selection and they have happy hour plus beer specials every night.  The food for me is just Ok, 9 times outta 10 the food is very dry especially the wings. You would think a wing place would give you enough sauce but too often it appears to have dried before it ever reaches the table. Not a good way to serve food. They use to have those smiley face fries which were sooo good but of course they got rid of them. The fries the now serve are thin and flavorless no fun to eat but you do because they come with the meal. I've had the chicken wrap before with my favorite sauce which is the Spicy garlic. It taste really good as does most of their sauces but if they used more sauce i'd up the rating.  The have wing specials on tuesdays and thursdays for their bone-in and boneless wings but i don't even go for them anymore. The beer is probably the only reason why I do go and the sporting events. They have several TV's and and two big screens for the main events. Go with a group it's a lot better especially because of the noise level.",

It's quite a good deal.  The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived, despite there being a hockey game on. We were seated in a booth and it really didn't matter where we were, we were able to watch the game comfortably. Our waitress fairly attentive and did let us know about the special.   We ordered two medium sized boneless buffalo (mild) and bbq honey sets. My boyfriend asked for extra blue cheese and she definitely gave us extra!! Which is good.. i think he could drink that stuff.   We also ordered a basket of fries. The fries were cold once we had gotten them, and she had initially forgotten to bring them. Even if they were warm, they were kind of sub-par, not sure i'd order again. Not a whole lot of seasoning/ salt/ anything.   We both also got two beers. There is a very nice selection of different beers on tap, which I am a big fan of. However, I do not believe there were any drink specials, which is totally fine.   We ended up ordering WAY more food than I think we had expected and took a lot home. Definitely coming back for this boneless deal!  The picture is about half the amount of wings we had ordered, because my boyfriend couldn't wait long enough before devouring into them.",

The meal started off on a bad note when my dad ordered a Dr. Pepper and it tasted weird. We grabbed our waitress to let her know that it was off and she told us that it couldn't taste off because of the color of the drink. She said she would pour him a fresh drink and I watched her walk over to the drink station, pour out his drink, and use the same cup with the straw in it to fill it up with ice... She did NOT use the ice scooper, she put his cup right in the ice. So she brings another Dr. Pepper which tasted just as weird and he requested another pop. She again put his used cup into the ice to fill up the cup.  We ordered our food which took quite a long time but it was during a Steelers game and all of the tables were full. When it finally got to our table my dad's French fries were cold and when he tried to tell the waitress she again gave attitude but did bring him fresh fries. The other two meals we ordered were okay at best. The buffalo chicken wrap at Eat n Park is significantly better than BWW and the buffalo mac n cheese was just bland and not spicy.  My dad went outside to put his gifts in his car and we told our waitress that it was his birthday and asked if they do anything for birthdays. She gave us a list of desserts so we ordered it, when she brought it over she said. Happy birthday, I'd sing to you but it's loud in here.  Overall we were really disappointed by the entire experience, my dad had a subpar birthday dinner and the server was just not nice.",

    "text": "I don't usually give a bad review but this was the worst ever. From the service, to the food to the tv's not working. I always leave a tip but not this time. It was BOGO wings. So I ordered a snack. After a half hour I got a dozen and half of cold wings that were probably sitting around for who knows how long. I ordered wings, why would the bartender not bring napkins. I had to wait and ask for them. I had a pile of glasses and stuff in front of me and she never checked. Then I waited another 15 minutes to get my bill cashed out. Seriously it's BOGO night and you have one horrible bartender. I knew I should have gone to the Rosecliff. Better wings, service and everything!! Even if it is smoking. Get your shit together. That was an embarrassment.",

They offer something for those who are into trivia games as well as those who enjoy watching sports.  When ordering I layer my order because the food comes up quickly, so I often order my main course upon receiving the appetizer.  Garlic Parmesan wings are fantastic as are their walking tacos, I don't think I've had a bad dish here.",

The server took our appetizer order, we ordered deep fried pickles. The pickle chips arrived quickly and was very tasty. The three of us ordered wings both boneless and with bone. Our meals arrived just as we were finishing our pickle chips. The wings tasted mushy and without much flavor which was so disappointing. The wings had the texture as if it wasn't cooked enough. We were all hoping this wasn't True, For a restaurant that specializes in wings I expected the wings to be spectacular. We all agreed we should have gone to the Texas Roadhouse across the street Will avoid Buffalo Wild Wings in the future.",

They also have a television in every place they could put a television. Their drinks are amazing and the servers are super proactive. My best friend had a problem with her meal and the manager quickly took it back and replaced it. My personal fave is the honey barbecue boneless chicken and the deep fried mushrooms  (who knew that was a thing). They also have a homemade Pico that's pretty darn amazing. I'm glad one of these isn't near my house because the food is delicious.",

I dealt with two staff members. The hostess and one working the to-go. The hostess was welcoming. The to-go staff member seemed like she was irritated and didn't want to deal with me from the moment I stepped up to order. Even had the nerve to look me up and down like she had a problem.  Never going there again. The staff issue is a huge turnoff. However, I have no reason to pay a restaurant for less than mediocre food. At least make it up to mediocre.",

    "text": "We  have been to Buffalo Wild Wings several times. The slow service,  and loud customers, keep me from making this a restaurant on our rotation list. The food is average at best and I have never been a fan of bar food. If you are a sports bar lover, this is the place for you. Tv's everywhere you look. I think too many.  You do have a choice to eat inside or outside on the side patio to escape some of the noise.  The kids love it because they offer a play pad for their busyness wail waiting for the average tasting food. They have a good kids menu and they have no issue finding something, like the corn dogs and fries. I always get the chicken wrap, I am not a fan of greasy finger food. The choices of sauces for wings is very good.  It is hard to watch a sporting event with all the tv's and loud customers. We come because the kids enjoy the food and like the play pad. They have separated the bar and dining area but the noise factor is still there and obnoxious at times. I think it is great for those that love the sports bar experience and atmosphere as well as the bar food.  I have heard many complain about the take out. We have never ordered out and cannot comment. I do have to say each time we have visited, the bathrooms have been clean and well taken care of. I have never had a manager ask about the service or food. The servers have been friendly, but extremely slow, in taking order and receiving food.",
