    "text": "After reading some reviews on here and also having been to the restaurant that previously occupied the space, I was a little hesitant to eat here tonight. However, I was pleasantly surprised.   The decor was much nicer than I expected. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely.  We were greeted promptly by our waitress. She was very friendly and great with our 17 month old son.   Our orders were taken promptly and bread was brought to the table quickly. The dipping oil was delicious! I had the house salad with the fig balsamic vinegarette. It was incredibly good. My husband had a cup of the sausage bean soup which he thought was pretty good. For our entrees, I had the pesto gnocchi and my husband had the lamb ragu.  The pesto gnocchi was outstanding! I was served with a pesto cream sauce and candied walnuts. The walnuts made me hesitate at first, but I am so glad that I took a chance and tried it. It was a fabulous combination. I ended up bringing about 1/3 of mine home for later. My husband liked the lamb ragu, but didn't love it. I tasted it and it was good, but nothing to rave about. My son got the children's pizza. It was HUGE. He will get a few more meals out of the pizza for sure. When we were finished, the waitress took care of the check promptly.   Overall, I had an excellent meal. My food was delicious, the service was spot on, and the restaurant was clean and pretty. Another plus, they are in the Enjoyment book! I recommend giving them a chance. I think you will be pleasantly surprised!!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Gianna Via's on 1/13/13 for a date night.  We were seated with no wait and drinks/menus were brought promptly.  We ordered the garlic bread pizza for an appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised at how big the portion was.  We actually only ate half and took the rest home.  I ordered the prime rib salad and my wife ordered the chicken marsala.  I also ordered a large yeungling draft, but the waitress was nice enough to point out that they were running a special on another size, which saved us some money on the bill.    The food came and we were not disappointed.  The salad was large and had quality greens, no iceberg lettuce.  The meat was also good, as were the dressing and other toppings.  My wife's marsala was not a huge portion, but it tasted great and was very filling.  The experience was great until it came time for the bill.  We had been finished eating for approximately 30 minutes and our waitress had not returned.  She had been given a large table and was preoccupied with taking care of them.  After another 15 minutes, I went to the bar to ask for takeout boxes and went to the hostess table to get our bill.  They had to track down our waitress so that we could pay (I think the owner had to track her down).  We were able to then pay, but nobody really apologized for the wait or offered anything in return.  Overall the restaurant is a great value and a nice atmosphere with great quality food.  I was just disappointed in how long it took to get our bill and pay.  We will definitely return again.",

    "text": "Just had my birthday dinner celebration there the other night- dinner special was the prime rib. It was excellent! Now the downside- we had a party of 15- a task that is no small feat for 1 server, even in optimally staffed situations. Our server was on top of things at first but it soon became clear that the supporting staff was spread EXTREMELY thin. I understand that this fault does not fall to the server, rather it is a very poor reflection on management. 1 server for multiple tables of 10+ guests at each table is a management FAIL. 70 min+ until everyone at the table had their dinner. I really felt bad for the staff. They did do their level best, and as such, I tipped accordingly to their True effort.  Disorganized chaos is a polite way to put it. Sorry guys, I'll be going elsewhere in the future for these types of occasions. But hey! My prime rib was excellent!",

    "text": "I am writing to express my disappointment during our recent dining experience, at Gianna Via's.  From the time this restaurant opened, my husband and I have been loyal weekly customers.  We talked very highly of this restaurant and recommended it to many people.  It is in a convenient location from our home and the food here had been great.  There is a wide selection of food to choose from, the staff were able and willing to make recommendations, and were very attentive to all of our needs.    During our most recent trip, we sat in the bar area.  We ordered drinks as we looked over the menu, were happy with our experience thus far.  Soon after, the owner of the restaurant came in and sat near us.  All of the staff seemed to get very tense when he walked in.  From the time he sat down, he criticized the staff, drinks, and the food in front of us and the rest of the customers.  He even brought the chef out to reprimand him for his cooking, making us feel very uncomfortable.  I feel as if this was very unprofessional.  Many individuals from South Hills Country club were there for their dinner as well.  The owner talked to them only making us feel almost unwanted in this establishment.  We left there that night, feeling bad that we actually have been giving this guy our money.    I feel as if it is one thing to hold a daily meeting to voice concerns, helping the staff and restaurant improve as a whole, but to do it in front of customers is completely uncalled for.  Again, I do not find this professional at all.  After recently reading reviews, I find this is a common complaint of customers and sometimes it goes so far that the owner talks about the people who confront him on his wrongdoing.  I may only have one mouth, but it is a big mouth, as a dissatisfied customer I will make sure never to return and to tell others of our horrible experience at this place, so that they do not make the same mistake of being a patron here again.",

The bar area is a great place to watch a game and have a couple of drinks. They always have food and drink specials and there's a good clientele. They have a great back room for showers, birthday parties etc. that I've used a couple times. As far as the bad reviews I've read about the owner, I feel they are unfounded.  Sure he's trying to run a business which isn't always easy and sometimes comes off the wrong way but Gianna vias employees and provides income to a lot of people, many of whom are single mothers, college students, etc. Who have been there for years. My interaction with the owner and his wife have been excellent and they treat their employees like family. What you can't put in the words with a review of food or service is the support this place provides the local community. I know every New Year's eve they sacrifice a nights business and hold a private party that must cost them thousands to raise a significant amount of money for make a wish. I highly recommend the place.",

We have been here several times and I usually split the portabella and wild mushroom pizza with my husband, which is always fairly tasty.  I guess he was feeling carnivorous and opted for the filet salad, so I order the grilled Tuscan Panini sandwich.  The dinners received a collective \"meh\" all around.  My sister had the salmon and she said we could make better at home.  I was surprised my sandwich came with Chicken since it was not listed anywhere in the description.  They also didn't have it on the Panini press long enough to even slightly melt the cheese, and it was cold throughout.  The homemade chips were pretty good though.  Next time I will just stick with the pizza (which is boosting this rating up to 3 stars).  They do have several dessert options which we couldn't resist and they were all thoroughly enjoyed.    I eat here when I'm visiting my family in Whitehall, but this is not a place I would go out of my way to patronize.  An upside is that it does provide another option in Caste Village to avoid the crowds at the madhouse that is Armstrong's.",

We then proceeded to the bar for a drink.  Again, no \"last call\" warning - the lights suddenly came on.  While we were waiting for two friends to return from the restroom, two workers came over to us and told us to exit through the side door.

    "text": "I must start my review with a disclaimer: I am a former employee of GiannaVia's. I started as a dishwasher and worked my way up to line cook. I don't know how things have changed since I left to take a full-time job in 2013, but I know my experience there was great, and I have been back many times since to keep in touch, and to eat the food of course!  I grew up in Whitehall Borough; it's a tiny, tiny little place with not much in the way of unique eateries. You have to travel to neighboring boroughs to find much worth your time. Armstrong's is in the same shopping center as GiannaVia's, and I was never a fan of it, so I was happy that with GiannaVia's renovation and addition of a bar, Armstrong's finally had some decent competition. GiannaVia's is a highlight in Whitehall because of its focus on quality ingredients and diverse menu.   GiannaVia's has a menu that has expanded much over the past few years, offering a range of Italian dishes, from the simple, rustic (and very popular) pasta d'angelo, to more 'luxurious' fare like pesto gnocchi and salmon with risotto and mixed vegetables. They also offer more standard food like personal pizzas, panini, fried appetizers of all kinds, and a great bunch of salads.   I know from firsthand experience that a large percentage of the dressings, sauces, and entree components are made from scratch, in-house. The ingredients are quality. The head chef there is a very passionate, driven young guy who takes food service and culinary creativity very seriously. I think he's a wonderful fit for the restaurant; he is always coming up with new ideas for specials, and does his best to maintain quality. Rest assured that if you have an issue with your food at GiannaVia's, it will be taken care of.   Even before I was an employee here, I would come in often with my family to get the soup of the day (usually one broth-based soup and another cream-based) with a panini. The panini are just the right size, with a toasty 'crunch' when you bite into the bread. The classic Italian panini was always my favorite - the perfect combo of capicola, salami, ham, and the like. I also love their pizzas, which are all baked to-order in a wood-fire oven. I'd recommend the buffalo chicken pizza if you like the conglomeration of salty, creamy (blue cheese!), smoky, and spicy. You honestly can't go wrong with a pizza here if you don't want to stray too far from 'normal.'   For some reason I think GiannaVia's salads stand out. They can get a bit pricy (I'm looking at you, salmon salad), but I love the combinations of ingredients. Try the beet salad, with roasted beets, pears, and goat cheese, or opt for my favorite, the heirloom tomato tower, a non-traditional \"salad\" that puts thick, juicy heirloom tomato slices in the spotlight, accompanied by fresh mozzarella, capers, and a balsamic glaze that I swear I could guzzle right out of the container.   GiannaVia's has a pleasant atmosphere, with lots of seating, a modest but beautiful bar that's out of the way of the regular dining room (without feeling like the bar and restaurant are separate entities), and an additional, spacious party room with some nice fixins' like a flat-screen TV and a fireplace. I have personally come back after my employment there for a party for my grandfather and can say that having a party catered at GV's is generally hassle-free. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Food comes out quickly, and I know from working in the kitchen that the flow of things is organized and quality-oriented.   The restaurant also has a breakfast menu, which is pretty good, though it's not the best breakfast in the 'Burgh. Expect to wait a while if you come for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Churchgoers from across the street seem to overflow right into the waiting area.   I can't say much else other than I really enjoy the food here. It can get a little expensive if you add appetizers, sides, and entrees together - it's very easy to spend $20 here - but I think it's well worth it for the portions and quality.",

I have to admit that my expectations were low going in because it seems I've become somewhat of a city snob, thinking that all the suburbs have to offer is chain restaurants and pizza. Shame on me because Gianna's is serving up some tasty classic Italian fare.  They served warm bread with a delicious balsamic dipping oil - seriously, I couldn't stop dipping even with my wedding less than 5 days away! We both ordered the wedding soup (2.50 extra with the lunch specials but included in most entrees). I thought the broth had great depth of flavor and I loved that fresh spinach was added just before serving so it retained the pretty green color and a little texture. I'd have liked more noodles, but I always have this complaint so never mind me.  For my lunch dish, I ordered the lunch portion of the Tuscan Florentine. Still a huge portion that would have been more than enough for a dinner but I cleaned my plate because it was so tasty. Angel hair pasta tossed with marinara and heavy cream, just the right amount of cream that the sauce was still light but decadent. The tangy bursts of sun dried tomato and the fresh spinach mixed throughout made for a very well rounded pasta dish. I think it'd be great with the grilled shrimp add-on for dinner.  They aren't reinventing the wheel, everything on the menu is familiar and sometimes that's what is so great about italian food. I'll definitely stop back to try some other items off the menu and check out their cocktail menu.",

Eggs not cooked...one piece of ham in the omelet...toast cold.....waffle was just that...a waffle....cold.  Place was packed....but again, food was terrible.  Other people sitting next to us were terribly disappointed also.   We would have been much better off at Eat N Park.....much cheaper too.  Will never go back for their breakfast....and our waiter/manager kept telling us prior to us being served....best breakfast in town!!!!",

We sat in a booth in the bar area which was very nice. The server came took our drink order forgot my husbands beer twice. We had the spinach dip. Which was very bland it was served on what seemed to be a pre cooked pizza shell. The wedding soup was amazing. My husband ordered chicken Parm I had a margherita pizza. The chicken Parm was horrible. The server was very rude. When she asked after we were ready to leave how our food was I started to tell her and she blurted I'll take it off. Then stormed off. She did not check on us at all during our meal only to tell us that our food would be awhile. I believe her name was Tiffany. I will not be returning.",

Today I had the spinach artichoke dip for the first time which is served on bread, kinda like a small pizza. It is creamy without being overly cheesy and heavy. My boyfriend got veal Marsala which was cooked to perfection! The meat was tender and the sauce very flavorful. I got rigatoni with meat sauce that was good, not great. I should've gone with the lobster ravioli. I highly recommend stopping in. Chef Matt loves to experiment and come up with new exciting dishes.",

They have a good kids menu, although usually my kids have the Italian wedding soup (they also like the kid's spaghetti and meatballs). The place is clean and usually we have had one of the same 3 servers. The outdoor seating is nice when the weather is good. They do half off appetizers outside and at the bar. They also have good gluten free choices including pizza. The prices are ok--perhaps a bit higher than some Italian places but not outrageous. I have never met the owner but was disappointed to read other reviews saying he was treating staff poorly. In my 30 or so visits to Gianna Vias, I have never witnessed that and in fact have seen the same staff most of the time, so the employee turn over seems to be low.",

The first time I ordered through Uber they completely messed up my order and to make it right they mailed me a gift card. Although the giftcard was a nice gesture, I would have rather had a refund because I ordered a second time and couldn't use the giftcard on my meal. I paid out of my own pocket the 2nd time I ordered and asked for 2 ranches on the side for my fiances meatball hoagie because he CAN NOT eat it without ranch, they forgot the ranch So they messed up yet another meal from my order. My fiance called to explain the error and their manager picked up the phone and proceeded to tell him the sides of ranches weren't written in the order (as if he were lying). I looked at my Uber order and it showed I asked for the 2 ranches in the order, but we gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it wasn't visible on their end.  After my fiance hung up I looked at the receipts and it showed that in fact the 2 orders of ranch were on the order ticket that we received with out delivery. We called back and told him we found the receipt and he just said \"sorry, we forget things sometimes.\" And hung up on my fiance. This restaurant obviously can't handle simple requests, the food was soggy and not worth the price and the manager was extremely rude!! Save your money and go to Pasta Too.",

My husband ordered there special with pork tenderloins wrapped in bacon and it looked delicious! He told me it was fantastic!!! We ordered an app of Italian nachos and they were excellent!!!!!

    "text": "While I don't make it down to Gianna Via's as much as I'd like, it's one of my favorite places in Whitehall. The food is good and the bar is event better.  Food wise, I normally stick with the pizza. The dough and other ingredients are always extremely fresh and the sauce is delicious. The pizzas are cooked perfectly in a woodfired oven. Now, when I do pizza I do it right. The last one I had here was custom with mushrooms, italian peppers, red onion, meatballs, spinach, artichokes, banana peppers, and fresh basil.   Bar wise, I think they should use this as a tag line....\"Dive bar prices in a high class space.\" Seriously, I can't drink at the corner bar or in the South Side for half the price of Gianna Via's. The bartenders are awesome, drinks are great, TVs easy to see, and the crowd is laid back. Appetizers are half off at the bar, they have a great beer selection, and their's always a great drink special on top of their already great prices. Last night it was $5 Long Islands with the lowest quality liquor being Bacardi...not bad! Thursday are also wine bottle night...they're all $17 (or something close to that).  If you're looking to entertain some friends, or watch a game, this is a great place to do it!",

The chicken was very dry. It is not breaded and lacked flavor. I got gnocchi with my meal. It tasted like the cheap gnocchi you buy in a bag at the grocery store. Very gummy & didn't taste good at all. I had heard good things about this restaurant, so I was very disappointed. We waited at least 20 minutes for a drink refill. My son's lemonade was thick like syrup & tasted awful. This has to be the worst Italian I have ever eaten. The owner (I'm guessing) walked past our table several times, but couldn't stop to refill our drinks or pick up the bill that we had to wait another 20 minutes for the waitress to get to. I do not blame the waitress at all, because they were seriously understaffed on a busy night. I would suggest having the greeters help the waitress when it is that busy. The greeter was sitting on the bench when we left, while every one of the waitresses were running around like crazy. I can cook better Italian food at home. $14 for chicken Parmesan isn't bad if it tastes decent, but this was the worst I have ever tasted. I was there with my two children ages 6 and 7 who heard one of the waitresses swearing very loudly at the front of the restaurant. We will not be back.",

The waitress started out okay, but quickly ignored me for customers she preferred (she spent lots of time with the couple in front of me). I did not get offered bread. I did not get offered a drink refill. My entree came before my salad. I did not get offered cheese (pasta).The salad had the wrong dressing. The entree had burnt spots on it. Without asking, the waitress assumed I was taking the salad home and dropped a take out container on the table without a word. I asked for a lid for the salad dressing and she came back much later and slapped it on herself. I waited at least 10 minutes for my check. The entire experience was awful. I did not make a stink. I did not tip well, but actually feel regret that I tipped at all. I may never go back.",

Nothing was particularly bad or awful, but it was overall underwhelming.   The service and atmosphere was fine and the outdoor seating nice in good weather. I thought the food was mediocre and overpriced for the product. I specifically recall getting a penne a la vodka dish with chicken but it wasn't actual chicken breast. Instead it consisted of some sort of shredded chicken. The pizza was also bland and had too much crust around the outside.   I really don't recommend Gianna Via's. I would return if someone with me really wanted to go, but if you're in the mood for Italian, I think you can do better.",

They do have a pizza menu but have not tried yet.  Had homemade lobster & shrimp ravioli for dinner first visit.  Get 5 medium sized ravioli for a price of $18.  They were ok but nothing to write home about.  Next visit I ordered grilled portabella panini. (Pictured).  It is supposed to be made with roasted red pepper, aioli, provolone cheese and shredded romaine.  It was missing roasted red pepper and the rest of the ingredients are slim to none.  Had no flavor at all paid basically $9 for Ciabatta bread and an extra $1 for sweet potato fries.  The fries were very good.  Also the French onion soup was not bad but $7 for a bowl is a bit much.  When waitress asked how we liked everything we told her exactly what was not good.  She asked if she could get us something else that was an empty gesture because we were done eating then she just walked away.  Not impressed.  Maybe next time order through UBER-EATS delivery and try pizza at home.",

My husband had a Stromboli with mushrooms and spinach and thought it was outstanding. I had Pasta D'Angelo and a cafe salad. Both were delicious (we're always a fan of side salads that come with chick peas, and the balsamic was quite good). Even our 15 month old was enjoying it -- she ate more tonight than she has in months.   They were even quite accommodating when we realized my dish came without the chicken. Didn't matter. Was delicious without it.   Service is top notch. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Also very family friendly. Lots of families with young kids.",

    "text": "I'm updating my review and giving Gianna Via's only 3 stars bc they are just ok, not A-OK.    This is a new restaurant and I truly believe the kitchen is just working the kinks out.   All the elements are there for Gianna Via's to be a very good restaurant, but they have not come together yet.  The food is good.  It's alright.  Nothing to complain about but I'd compare it's current quality to Eat 'n Park.  It's good.  You won't hate it.  My sister is a vegetarian and ordered the Tuscan panini.  As she's a vegetarian, she tends to look for items not including meat on the menu.  It was not a happy surprise when the Tuscan panini came out with chicken on it.  She's not a vegan, so she ate it anyway and said it was alright.  She ate only half of it, and we took the left overs home.  My father said he went to reheat the panini for lunch, and the half that my sister hadn't eaten had a hair in it.  My brother in law had the steak salad which he seemed to love.  My father had the pasta diavolo (diablo) which he enjoyed.  Both my brohter in law and fathers LERVE their food and are not picky eaters.  My sister and I are a bit more discerning.  I had the salmon, and for the price I felt it wasn't great.  I'm almost certain that it was reheated frozen salmon, not fresh.  It was still pretty good, cooked just right to where it flakes and is still rare in the center.  The service was...ok.  Having waited tables myself I take into consideration things like this being a NEW restaurant still finding its legs when I review the service.  Our waitress was clearly having an AWFUL day.  The kind of awful day where she was ALL OVER THE PLACE and very forgetful.    Our drinks came out right away, but we were starving and we had to track her down and beg her to bring us the bread they bring to the tables.  When she brought our bread, it was frozen in the middle.  I'm not going to get mad about FREE BREAD, so we just waited (a long time) and flagged her down for new bread.  When she brought our second loaf out she said, \"I grabbed a loaf that's been sitting around for awhile so I'm sure it won't be frozen.\"  I guess they make frozen bread in the oven, but I still wouldn't tell a customer that their loaf had been sitting around for awhile.  The service was slow, we had to ask for our entrees and we had to ask for our checks.  I'm pretty sure this was our waitresses first time serving tables.  While the service was slow, she was really nice.  I say, give Gianna Via's a try, I really think that the food will continue to improve once this restaurant reaches its stride.   I'd also suggest vegetarians avoid ordering the Tuscan panini, or at least be sure to ask your server for confirmation your intended entree does not include meat.",

It was can beets and thrown straight onto the plate after being cut up. She was very disappointed in her salad.  They give a nice basket of garlic rolls and my side salad was good.  The place is a bit dirty if you look at the walls under the table etc.  They have what seems to be some great bar specials of food and drink so I think we might try that side next time. Hopefully it's better over there.",

WOW, just WOW! BRAVO!  1st course was a watermelon & feta salad paired with erath rose of pinot noir. refreshing, preparing you for what was to come. now i have to buy some feta! 2nd course was a pan seared duck breast with a port wine cherry sauce, paired with las mulas cabernet sauvignon. i love duck, so i was really excited for it, & i was not disappointed! i could've eaten a 2nd breast! 3rd course was KILLER!!! chef's bbq grill with smoked gouda polenta paired with born of fire cabernet sauvignon. the grill consisted of a portion of salmon, a lamb chop, a petite filet &......pork belly!!! that was THE BEST grill i have ever had! each piece of meat was done to perfection. pork belly!!! who knew that they knew that I love pork belly?! 4th course as 1 kick butt dessert! key lime coconut cake paired with murph chardonnay. real curls of coconut on top! they even had a little giveaway of some wines! tom & i have been to several wine dinners, & i can honestly say these folks know how to do it! the wines are all quite good, & there's always plenty to go around! the food has been outrageously wonderful! the staff works hard & does a great job keeping everyone, & everything, happy & running smoothly.

The sad part is that I am a member of ILKB ( I love kickboxing) and they were a partner business for a 10% discount . No I r had any clue and the girl at the front made a big deal about 10% and she threw my credit card on the counter .

They have everything, from the very simple, eggs, toast & coffee to the more complex, make your own omelette. And everything is reasonably priced! Their coffee is hot, flavorful and comes in a good sized mug. The staff is friendly and they work well together as a team. We usually get their Village breakfast which includes 3 eggs any way, red skinned potatoes and one can choose from a wide selection of meats and toast. My 'go to' is potatoes, eggs over easy, sweet sausage paddy (delicious) and rye toast. For my wife it's scrambled eggs (very fluffy), potatoes, crispy bacon & no toast. Fresh and oh so good. We've also had the pancakes, waffle, western and meat lovers omelette.. I am sorry to read the less than stellar reviews. I get it, no place is perfect.

We never had our water glasses filled, was never asked how our meals were (they were good). The outside shades were down to block the sun, but another server (young kid, not Jimmy), pulled them back up & said they have to be at this height. Ummmm, aren't I a paying customer?? Why can't the shade be down for us to block the sun?? Just so incredibly frustrating. I've had this server before. He is not friendly. Seems overwhelmed, perhaps?

I'm surprised at the bad ratings because we were very pleased: very friendly service, food came out in reasonable time, portions were huge, food delicious! Two things stood out for us: the child menu was inexpensive and the portion huge (our 3 year old grand made three meals out of it!) and the selection of beers and craft beers was amazing! We're from Colorado so not easily impressed by beer selections elsewhere. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that we asked about calamari (our Italian restaurant staple) and were told they discontinued it even though it was a best seller. Next time we're in the Mt Lebanon area, we will definitely go back here!",

The last time we were there, we had an early dinner and sat at the bar.  The owner was sitting at the end of the bar with his buddies and was speaking loudly about the bartender and calling her the \"C\" word.  I was the only other female in the bar location and he could have cared less if he was offensive. He is the most obnoxious, arrogant and inappropriate business owner I have ever experienced in my life.  The staff are fantastic and should really give consideration to leaving this restaurant and find a boss who treats them and their customers with some respect!  I have read several reviews on this site and I will also be sure to let everyone know of my experience at this establishment and would never recommend anyone spend any of their hard earned money only to be  put in this ignorant bastard's pocket!  I am giving 1 star because the staff is great, otherwise I would give no stars!",

One time I ordered biscuits and gravy for brunch, and the biscuits were so hard it was like cutting into a rock. My eggs were like chewing on sponges...Yesterday, I just spent $30 on two burgers for pick up, and I could've went to Burger King and been way more satisfied for a fraction of the price. Their menu descriptions made it sound gourmet, but I'm almost certain the patties are frozen and the size could've passed for sliders. Total disappointment. The bar is nice though.

And I'm very glad that I did!   The service was so, so. But the staff was very kind and friendly so it made up for it. The menu was extensive, items ranging from steak and crab cakes to sandwiches and chicken wings. We decided to order the grilled salmon, which was served with risotto and fresh veggies & the lobster ravioli which was to die for! Not to mention the appetizer (Ruben flatbread) which was out of this world good.   Not only was the food delicious, but our drinks were as well! We both tried one of the $7 martinis (Wednesday night special) and they were both top notch!   Saying this place was a great experience is an understatement. The food quality was untouchable, and the drinks were very unique. To top it off, the prices were very reasonable which is a rarity these days.   Outside patio seating, not the prettiest view (parking lot) but a very nice option on warmer days! There are dogs allowed outside on the patio as well.",

They have a great breakfast/brunch because the restaurant was packed when I got there. For the baby shower, we had brunch as our meal.   There was French toast, bacon, scrambled eggs, fruit salad, sausage, and so much more. The food was very good. I would definitely go back to try something off the menu.   Unfortunately, the only downfall was that the space they had for the baby shower guests was just a little too small. It was little too cramped for a bigger party.   However, if I'm in the South Hills - I would definitely stop in again. When I was leaving, lots of a customers were ordering the pizzas and they smelled to die for!",

When we come here, we only sit at the bar because you really can't beat the specials. The drink specials are great, but even better are the half off (select) appetizers. FYI, this special also applies to their outdoor seating, but not in the dining room. A few appetizers that we've tried that we really enjoyed are the bruschetta and spinach and artichoke dip. I love tomatoes, so the large chunks of tomato on their bruschetta makes it my favorite appetizer. One of these days we will try their pasta and entrees, but it's hard for us to decide on anything other than their pizza. My husband will tell you that Gianna Via has his favorite restaurant pizza. Their pizzas are consistently good, with a crispy outer crust and very fresh toppings.   Gianna Via is definitely our go-to when we're looking to hang out locally in a casual setting, sip on drinks and enjoy eating some carbs.",

He said he enjoyed the crab cakes but the risotto and vegetables were not great. He said the vegetables were cold and the risotto had \"unique\" flavors. We ended the night with chocolate cake.

    "text": "One of my favorite local restaurants!! Service is always efficient and friendly, food always fresh. I love the margarita pizza!! The crust is to die for, it's a cornmeal type crust that's amazing!! Their turkey burger and sweet potato fries are also great if you're not in the mood for Italian. The wedding soup is a great started, and the pasta deangelo is an old favorite of mine! Definitely recommend",

    "text": "Was visiting Pittsburgh for my bridal shower (my whole family lives here), and this was the place we all came to eat at. We were in a separate room that had two long tables inside - we sat at only one of the tables. After sitting, the servers (I believe there were two), greeted us and grabbed drink orders. Overall, the service was decent - no complaints here. My concerns are the food itself. Appetizers were bruschetta and fried zucchini. The brushetta had nice flavor, but the tomatoes were stacked wayyy too high (for my liking). The zucchini was not very good. It seemed like it was under fried and sat in the window for a while because it was really soggy. My entree was the chicken marsala. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was slightly under flavored but the chicken... The chicken was very dry and charred badly. I did not even finish half of my meal (which I actually shared with someone - so a fourth).  I visit Pittsburgh a lot (it is my hometown), and I have never been here before, but I probably not return.",

    "text": "What a great find!  We tried this restaurant at the advice of a relative, and we were thrilled.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside, and the inside decor isn't anything to write home about either, but the food is fantastic!  I loved the variety of items on the menu, including gluten free pizza crust, and the cocktails were great as well. As someone who is gluten sensitive, I LOVE being able to have brick oven gluten free pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And best of all, the prices are super reasonable.  Even the service was perfect.  Our server was one of the most attentive servers we have had in a restaurant in a very long time.  Her service was better than we have had in some 4-star establishments.  I can't say enough good about this restaurant, except that we will definitely come here whenever we come to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Never going back.  I visited this place to check out the new bar they put in.  We had an awesome bartender Susanne, and we had some killer cocktails.  However, the owner of the place was sitting down at the end of the bar, drinking(most likely drunk).  He was chastising his employees in front of his friends, like he was on a power trip.  This put the bartender in tears, and another waitress in tears.  Shortly thereafter, a patron of the bar left, yelling at the owner for treating his employees like crap.  Once he left, the owner and his \"buddies\" sat there loudly making fun of the customer for walking out. Stating \"I don't care if he ever comes back\".   Not only did this make us uncomfortable, it is beyond unprofessional. I will never return to this establishment, and I am happy to share this story with anyone who wants to listen.  Shame on him, and the piss poor management tactics.  There are 100 different ways this should have been dealt with.  The End.",

    "text": "I went to GV's for a family dinner on a recent Sunday night. The 9 of us made reservations and arrived at 6:30. We were taken to a back room for more space. The restaurant became quite busy by the time we left. For dinner, I ordered a cup of wedding soup and the penne vodka with chicken. The dish was described as spicy so I was intrigued. The wedding soup was fairly standard. I did enjoy the fact that the spinach was fresh and added on top the soup. However, I was missing more veggies and cheese. My chicken penne vodka was also nothing to write home about. There was a very small amount of chicken and the dish was far from spicy. In fact, it seemed much more creamy than most vodka sauces. I tasted my husband's special- pot roast with mashed pots and brussel sprouts. The pot roast was flavorful but the brussel sprouts were almost inedible. I love me some brussel sprouts. When done correctly, they can be salty, crispy and savory. These brussel sprouts were mushy and bland.  Overall, the food was average for this type of restaurant. I doubt I will return to GV's because there are many other family style restaurants around with more flavorful selections.",

My raviolis were clearly made in house and the sauce really had a strong fresh tomato flavor.  My husband had the chicken Alfredo, and he only wished the chicken had been grilled.  He ate it all though and really liked the sauce.  We will be back!",
