We were taking out my daughter for her birthday along with three others......I didn't want to be hanging out in God knows what type of weather we experience here in April, so that was a plus. We were promptly greeted and seated upstairs in a cozy booth type seating area. This was fine...it allowed us to be as loud as  the wine dictated. Speaking of, it's a BYOB....also a plus for me. We went over board on the apps...they bring out bread and a hummus style dip when you are seated. We tried the smoked Gouda (good but needed to be hotter), the Greek meatballs (our fave) and the crispy cheese bruschetta (good and crunchy fried cheese disks with tomatoes, cheese and herb topping). The meals sampled were the Pork chop (ginormous and juicy) the strip steak (son in law loved it) the crab cakes (daughter said she get that again) the special was a salmon risotto (also huge portion and really good) finally I had the salmon on kale (good, but should have been more adventurous. All in all........good food, good service........will definitely go back.",

The dishes are exquisitely prepared, the food is very fresh and flavorful, menus selections are innovative.  We also receive wonderful service and attention from the staff, and the chef always comes out to check on us after the dishes are served;  last time we were there we said we were too full to order desert and were then presented with a large complimentary plate of fresh strawberries for desert!  It is BYOB- so bring some nice bottles of wine to accompany your meal.   A wonderful find!",

    "text": "Our 3rd time here...  First things first, the food was phenomenal which is what matters...however this not the best experience overall.   Our server was kind and attentive, however, seemed overwhelmed and did not recall our appetizer order (asked 3 times if we wanted one after ordering) resulting in a cold batch of arancini (still delicious while cold though).   The overall atmosphere of this place is awesome but their seating arrangement leaves some to be desired. Unfortunately tonight, we were stuck next to (fairly close) a very loud and vulgar group of people who were also very 'nosey' into our conversation and what we were doing. Luckily, they left pre-salad.   Our meals were great but I'd forego the copious amounts of \"remoulade\" with the crab cakes. The cakes themselves were very light and flavorful. Large chunks of crab and overall a fantastic plate paired with the Asiago Risotto.   As our night wound down, it seemed that the entire restaurant staff did too. We had a prolonged wait for our card to be processed for upwards of 15min after declining dessert. The staff seemed to have already closed down as we finished, making us feel hurried and unwanted. Upon leaving the restaurant, we also realized that our server failed to provide us with our leftovers that we had asked to be packaged (we weren't walking back, it was -10 degrees). The employees were in quite the hurry to finish their shifts.   Saulsilido - you're lucky your food is top notch, otherwise I'd be concerned.",

Our appetizer (goat cheese portabella), salad, and bread with the hummus dip were all great. We ordered the roasted seafood risotto special and that's where Sausalido lost a few points. The dish was quite bland with little substance in terms of seasoning. When my friend and I had our first bite, we both reached for the salt shaker.   I will definitely give Sausalido another try, but will go for a different main dish.",

    "text": "Note* I went here about a year ago so maybe things have changed a bit since then. However, this place was a big let down. The cost of the food here is equivalent to what you'd pay at some of the higher end restaurants in town (ex. Eleven), yet the quality and service is no where near those places.   We came here on a Friday night and the place was pretty much filled. I could tell right away the service was going to be a bit questionable. The staff seemed really stressed and frustrated. They were all running around in a semi-panic barely able to keep up. I looked at the wine menu and asked a few questions and my server admitted to not knowing anything about wine. That's okay, but based on the prices of the wine and food, the staff should be well trained in this area.  Then the food was just \"meh\". I ordered a steak and it wasn't trimmed or cooked correctly. It was also really under seasoned. My fiance ordered some pasta and she compared it to something we'd make at home on a lazy night by just using some canned sauce and boxed pasta.   Overall, a pretty big let down - especially since this place is so close to us.   If the cost of food here was about 50% less than what it currently is, I'd have given this place a much higher rating. As a restaurant though, if you're going to price your items in the top-tier you need to make sure your offerings are competitive with similar places. And this place fell substantially short.",

When we (3 people; not a large group) arrived the restaurant, there were people taking up approximately 4 tables with numerous tables open. Despite the apparent availability, we were rudely told (by the hostess) that the wait was 25min. When we confusingly asked why there was such a long wait, we again were rudely told \"the wait is 25min\" and no other explanation. So we left, went down the street, and settled in elsewhere. Even as we left, no one said a word to us. I can't believe the lack of customer service and rude treatment from the hostess. Never coming back here.",

The free bean dip/bread is a nice unique offering. The garden side salad was yummy and different than what you'd typically get. The quinoa puff appetizer was good but nothing compared to the ginormous pork chop on top of goat cheese chive whipped potatoes I got- deliciously prepared. My hubby got the crab cakes and risotto which was equally as amazing.   We really were impressed with this place- I think it is totally flying under the radar for how solid it is. We will definitely be back but hope the menu changes up every once in awhile as there aren't a whole lot of options.   My one suggestion- educate your servers about gluten allergies- it's a pretty common question, especially in fine dinging and my server had absolutely no idea what gluten even was.",

    "text": "Sausalido is a nice upscale Italian restaurant in the heart of Bloomfield.  The first thing you'll notice about this place is the relatively small space.  The layout is somewhat intimate; however, I couldn't help but be mildly turned off by the weird curtain partitioning the entrance from the remainder of the restaurant.  Despite what seemed to me as an eyesore, our experience was solid.  The menu is single paged, with limited appetizers, entrees and deserts.  Not a critique, but mostly in-line with menus of other upscale establishments.  Course by course:  The smoked gouda is an absolute must-order item.  Gently fried on the outside, nice and creamy on the inside-this item was cooked perfectly and was a great way to start out our meal.    Our entrees came with salads.  Nothing too special here: just a nice blend of greens with a the unique addition of beets.    My main meal consisted of a vegetarian ravioli dish, which was savory and well-executed.  My main critique however would be the sauce the ravioli was placed in was somewhat too watery for my tastes.  A creamier sauce would have been preferable.  My date enjoyed her risotto dish, which appeared to be a great value both in terms of portion size (freaking huge), and taste-very rich, very tasty.    Desert was a fantastic peanut butter creme brulee.  Highly recommended.    Overally, this restaurant is solid.  It wasn't the most memorable dining experience, but still solid and recommended.  Service was friendly, just a bit slow and inconsistent at times.  Online reservations via Yelp are a very nice touch.  This seems like a great place to check out if you you're looking to book an upscale restaurant in a pinch.  The BYOB is tremendous with $2 corkage fee.  Perhaps one of the best BYOB values in the city.",

The sear was fantastic, and the middle was juicy and delicious. It came with cabbage and apples which was all right, but not anything spectacular.  My friends both had the crab cakes with risotto. The crab cakes were amazing. I didn't care for the risotto. I thought it was kind of bland.  What really killed this place for me was the ambiance. It was extremely stuffy.

Overall a very good meal and experience. The BYOB is always a plus and they actually have nice wine glasses and pint glasses for your beer if needed. Nothing is worse then enjoying an upscale meal with a good bottle of wine and having to drink out of a small water glass.   On to the food. We started with the smoked Gouda, mostly due to the reviews on Yelp and the waiter's recommendation. We also had the lamb (meat)balls. Both were good, not anything to rave about. While I liked the Gouda, I certainly did not have the same experience I read about online. Good not great.  Same for the salads. Nothing special.   The main meal was another story. I had the pork chop. It was a finalist on my list of choices but the waiter's recommendation sold it for me. It was fabulous. So thick and yet so perfectly cooked throughout. Juicy with a seared crust. Excellent flavor. May be a death row meal finalist. Another member of our table had the duck and felt the same way. He even raved so much to the waiter that he brought the cook out to meet him (yes, he was a cook not a chef).   We had a cheesecake for dessert that topped off the evening nicely. We will recommend and we will be back. Thanks for reading. Enjoy your meal!",

For the amount and quality of food that I got, the $25.14 dinner was definitely worth it. Since Sausalido proclaims itself as an Italian restaurant, I wanted to try their version of a risotto. I do not know if restaurants are starting to this recently, but  I could tell that the rice in the risotto had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce. I do understand that it is time-consuming to make risotto but I was disappointed that an Italian restaurant would take this shortcut. Overall, I would definitely go back to Sausalido and try their other dishes.",

It is a BYOB, which is my favorite!  2$ cork fee per person, is totally worth it!   We were sat right away and had a great server.  She was very smiley and helpful.  The restaurant is not too small, but it is a nice intimate size.   The server brought us some really yummy white bean dip.  It was my favorite part of the meal!

The pasta was cooked well, not too \"gummy.\"  The sauce was.....well underwhelming.  It was ok.  I had to season it, because it really didnt have enough salt and pepper on it.  My husband got the duck.  He was also underwhelmed with his dinner.  His potatoes were under seasoned and the duck was VERY fatty.  (More than duck at most restaurants)   I would definitely give this place another try, because so many people seem to like it.  Maybe we caught it on an off night?",

Our most recent visit is an example.  What was once great service, has now become sloppy, inconsistent and inattentive.   Our server didn't pour the wine we brought, forgot the bread and bean dip, and while he refilled our water glasses ever ten seconds, he left clearly empty plates lying on the table for far too long.  The chef had to keep hollering from the kitchen to the staff to come pick up food.   Major upgrade needed here.  Food quality seems to have declined a bit as well.   The appetizers were great, with the smoked gouda app and the meatball app being highlights.   The meatballs are delicious, huge, easily enough to share.   But the entrees were lacking in basic preparation.    My duck dish came out not medium, but still quacking, and had to be sent back.   This is not a case of someone not liking rare duck -- the meat was cold and raw.    One of our guests had a steak that was likewise mis-cooked, only in this case, medium-well versus medium rare.    Maybe a bad night at the grill station, but this shouldn't happen.   During a prior visit, the risotto was perfectly cooked, but very poorly seasoned and assembled -- a heavy hand with the salt, and only the most minuscule bits of shaved steak to augment a giant bowl.  The signature dish, the pork chop, was still fantastic, and huge.   One guest of ours will have leftovers for 2 meals.   But overall, Sausalido seems to be headed in the wrong direction.   Hoping it can return to it's former glory, but we won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I went here for my birthday with three friends and Sausalido is amazing! First off, the food is delicious. We had the fried gouda appetizer and the daily risotto, crabcake risotto, and the duck entree. I felt the crabcake risotto was a bit on the creamy side (I personally don't like my food that heavy/creamy) but the taste was good. I think we all overloaded a bit too much on the bread, bean dip, and fried gouda. Get the fried gouda. It's amazing.  The best part about our experience was the service. Our waiter was attentive and personable. When we told him it was my birthday he made the appetizer on the house and gave me a free slice of cheesecake. So sweet! Will definitely be coming back :)",

    "text": "This restaurant is the best find I've been to in a long time! The baked Gouda appetizer is amazing. It's sweet, has balsamic and I think sun dried tomatoes or something tangy like that. The Ahi tuna portion was large and done perfectly with a wasabi topping that was excellent. The cod special was also excellent and lots of flavor. The tomato basil soup was not to our liking. A bit too light and thin. The flourless chocolate cake and the lemon cake were unusually good, and they make their own pastries there. Actually, these deserts were uncanny good. They're also a BYOB, an added plus. Our waitress had the best personality and was a lot of fun. She's worked there a long time and knew the items well. Blonde grad student. Will definitely be back soon and often! I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Sausalido was a great place to have our rehearsal dinner! They have a private upstairs room which was great for our large party. The food was excellent and I got many compliments from our guests.  Their prices were incredibly reasonable for the amount of food that was served. Overall we had bread with dip, salad, 2 appetizers, pasta, chicken, salmon and dessert. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Even though they had multiple call offs, they made sure to have enough staff for our party. The owner's wife even came in to help! We also had a few guests with strict gluten free/dairy free diets and they were able to accommodate them as well. They also had no corkage fee on wine which was appreciated! They boxed up all the leftover food and wine for us at the end of the night and made sure all the guests were properly taken care of throughout the night. Overall, I would highly recommend Sausalido for a rehearsal dinner/large dinner party due to their high food quality, friendly wait staff and reasonable prices.",

The restaurant was almost empty due to the Penguins hockey game that night, so I don't know what it's like when the restaurant is busy but we will definitely return.  The meat dishes (hanger steak and French cut pork chop) were melt in your mouth and saucy flavorful. The Pan seared duck was pretty tender and moist, and the crab cakes (always risky away from the coast) were delicious!  Appetizers were awesome:  smoked Gouda, crostini, and eggplant - subtle smoky. Service was friendly and helpful. There was no separate gluten free menu but I did fine (note that I am not allergic). We skipped dessert but loved the La Prima fresh brewed coffee. We'll be back. There's a public inexpensive parking lot on Cedarville just three short easy walking blocks away.",

    "text": "I have been dying to try Sausalido out as I have had food from their catering menu at various events and it was totally amazing!  We went for a birthday celebration and it could not have been a better night.  Our young waiter was fantastic and took our order and served the food in a timely manor.  It is BYOB and they did not charge a corkage fee although it does state on their website that a $2 corkage fee per person will be charged so be prepared.  The smoked gouda appetizer came highly recommended so we gave it a try.  I was a bit disappointed as it was a big piece of fried cheese-tasted like a fried ravioli.  It was tasty but did not come with anything.  We had some leftover bread they brought out which it paired nicely with.  For my entree I went with the pork which came with a very flavorful (lots of chives on top) whipped potatoes. All entrees are served with a side salad.  You had the choice of a special ranch dressing or vinaigrette. I went with the ranch which was very tasty-liked the fresh beets they put in the salad.  I was a bit disappointed with my pork as it was a large piece of meat with a good amount of fat and not that much flavor.  Others in my party ordered the crab cakes (came with 2 with tons of crab meat) and an asiago risotto which was to die for!  The pasta dish with mushrooms I also got to sample and it was a huge portion-big enough for 2 meals.  The restaurant was nice enough to let us bring birthday cupcakes for the celebration and brought them out with candles.  The space is small but it has the feel of a French bistro which made for a fantastic evening.",

I ordered the pork chops and my partner ordered the crab cakes - we both loved our food and took half our meals home to save room for the peanut butter and jam creme brulee and flamed bananas - so good!

There was a large business dinner going on and almost everyone else in the restaurant was there to redeem their Groupon before it expired today (8/20/14).  Half of the tables were  being used and the other half  had to be cleared.  We had to wait about 15 minutes before they got around to clearing off a table for us, however, once we got seated, the service was at a slow pace, but bearable.  Have to hand it to the two waiters.  Menu was limited but interesting. Had the pork chop. It was HUGE and tasty. Ended up taking half of it home.  The better half had the crab cakes which were also very good.  The white bean dip and bread also very also hit the spot.  Will go back again to try the other things that interested me.  Hopefully, the staffing will be better planned the next time.",

    "text": "Sausalido is located in hip neighborhood of Bloomfield.  On this Wednesday night (one day before Thanksgiving) the Italian district was bustling with hungry patrons, and people celebrating the end of the work week.   Sausalido isn't large; it probably seats 50, and the decor is minimal.  When we arrived at 7pm, there were a few other diners, and plenty of seating.  Our waiter arrived promptly, and offered to open our bottle of Cabernet (Sausalido is BYOB).   As he pulled the cork from our bottle, we asked for a plate of mussels and a Caesar salad with extra anchovies while we decided on our main dishes. A small plate of bread and bean dip arrived with some crusty French bread.  Our Cabernet was a nice accompaniment to the garlicky appetizer- yum.  Our mussels and Caesar salad arrived next.  My salad was served in a small bowl, and the romaine, croutons and fresh anchovies where piled high.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh; the Caesar dressing was tangy with just the right amount of garlic.  The mussels were served in a large bowl with a rich tomato broth and julienne zucchini.  The mullusca were fresh and sweet, and salty.  The tomato sauce was fresh, and was extra good on the crispy bread.  Entree choices were: Salmon with ratatouille and pesto, double-cut pork with mashed potatoes, and crab cakes served with risotto.  My salmon arrived piping hot.  I was surprised at the size of my portion; it was at least 8 oz. and cooked a perfect medium- delicious.  The basil pesto on top provided a beautiful color-contrast to the pinkness of the fish.  The ratatouille had large chunks of carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes, and zucchini- the veggies weren't over-cooked and added a nice texture contrast when eaten with the soft salmon.  I had a chance to sample the crab cakes, and can say that the creamy risotto they were served with was some of the best I've ever had.   The huge pork chop (bone-in) looked awesome as well, and was quickly devoured by one of my dinner companions.  \"How is it?\" I asked.  \"Delicious,\" he answered  We seriously considered not getting dessert, but were glad we did.  A large piece of pear and cinnamon cheesecake arrived at our table with four forks.  It was served with fresh berries in a pool of creme anglaise.  The cheesecake was dense, sweet, and rich- the pairs were deliciously fragrant.   Sausalido can be described as contemporary European cuisine, but I'll describe it as the one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh that you haven't discovered yet.  The combination of perfectly executed food, exemplary service, and fun atmosphere will make this one restaurant you'll want to return to.  Chef Chuck Kerber",

    "text": "Visited on a weeknight. There was one other couple dining so it was quiet and we sat right away. The waitress was friendly. The bean dip and bread they give you to start is super tasty. I ordered the salmon with coconut curry and greens, husband ordered the crab cakes with risotto. Our starter salads, with a helping of beets, were very good. The small aluminum bowl they serve it in is very awkward to eat out of, however.   My salmon was quite good and cooked perfectly; the sauce tasted great but was a tad thin (making it drippy to eat). The greens were underdone, and served in large leaves that had to be cut to actually eat, which was difficult because of the underdone-ness. The well-done pieces were a good complement to the dish, though I would have preferred a starch with the salmon. My husband's crab cakes were very good, great crab-to-filling ratio, but he said he found several shell pieces. The risotto was the perfect texture but a hint too much salt for me.  Now the ambiance, sadly, leaves much to be desired. There was no music playing in the front of the house, so we were serenaded by KISS FM being blared in the kitchen. The chef alternated between singing along with the music and sitting outside at their outdoor seating drinking a beer and chatting with buddies. He and our server often had personal conversation, which I don't mind if done out of earshot, but they made little effort to avoid airing their personal business for everyone inside. When you're paying $25 for an entree, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect some quiet mood music and atmosphere during your meal. This might be due to it being a slow weeknight, but still.  We'll probably go back on weekends when it's busier and the staff are not so much in \"laid back\" mode. All in all it's great, fresh food so I still recommend it.",

It's a small, warn little restaurant with maybe 15 - 20 tables. As others have noted, it's BYOB, with a $2/person corkage fee. The menu is quite small, but it's still difficult to decide because everything, literally everything, sounds fabulous. Our waiter was perfect, attentive and friendly without being obtrusive. I ordered the restaurant week Prix fixe meal, which, sadly, wasn't actually on the regular menu. From start to end, it was amazing. After the appetizer, I told my girlfriend that Sausalido was going into our rotation, and by the end of the meal, she agreed that it would be a priority restaurant for us from now on. If you should go when they have it, the paella is the best I've ever eaten, and the side salad with shaved brussels sprouts and feta was really amazing. Portions are large enough to fill me up and for my girlfriend to bring some home. There's parking on Liberty Street, or a municipal parking lot behind the restaurant, I think I'm the same block. Go to Sausalido! It could not have been more fantastic.",

    "text": "I can't understand the good reviews this place has gotten.  This was our second trip- the first was just after they opened and we didn't love it but figured since it has been open for awhile the kinks would be worked out.  8 of us went for a birthday celebration the other night, so between us we tried most everything.  Throughout our meal there were major problems with execution.  BYOB is nice, the white bean dip is ok but bland.  The various breads were generally good.  Everything was downhill from that point.    Apps: we had artichoke dip, stuffed zuchinni, and the gouda.  The gouda was fine, it was only room temp to slightly warmed but it's cheese and can't help but be tasty.  The zuchinni was notable only for not being bad.  The artichoke dip (2 orders, both this way) was just awful- it was more of an artichoke soup.  Chunks of oversalted artichokes floating (seriously- they were bobbing around like apples) in a thin, milky lukewarm broth with giant chunks of soggy unmelted cheese.  The center was cold- refrigerator cold.  We pointed this out to the manager, who didn't apologize or seem to note anything wrong, but offered to heat one up for us.  30 seconds in the microwave later it was steamy but the ingredients still weren't combined and it was still more soup than dip.  I think what is most bothersome isn't that there was clearly a prep error but that even after it was sent back, there was no quality control in the kitchen.  A mushroom \"bisque\" which appeared to contain no cream was watery, salty, and uninspired.  Mains: our table tried the crab cakes, pumpkini ravioli, pork, London broil, and catfish.  Nothing stood out, and the pork was very dry and bland with an unappetizing combination of mushy sweet potato cubes and some unidentifiable grits-like topping.    Dessert: Creme brulee, which semed to go over well.  We also had the red velvet cheesecake, which was bad enough that 8 people sharing didn't finish even half of it.  It took awhile to put our finger on the problem, but as one astute companion pointed out it was salty.  Combined with a strangely dense and chewy texture, the overall effect was of a lurid pink playdoh served on topsoil.    I like for places to do well, and I try to give them a fair chance.  If the food had just been not to our liking or even just plain bad, I probably would have chalked it up to a bad night and not written a negative review.  What bothered me and prompted this entry was that we so clearly weren't happy with our meal and there was never a point where any staff recognized the problem, asked if anything was wrong (when 8 people eat and not a single person finishes a single dish and something is sent back, there is likely a problem), or offered to remove the completely uneaten artichoke dip-soups from our bill.  That tells me that there are either no standards or that no one cares. It seems that others have had a good experience here, but I would avoid it as the prices are too steep to be hit-or-miss.",

    "text": "This was a great find on Liberty.  We recently had lunch here and were incredibly impressed with the quality of the food.  I definitely recommend trying Sausalido for lunch considering the menu's are almost identical except lunch is cheaper.     Our experience started with warm bread that came out with a bean puree that was dressed with multiple layers of incredible flavors and could easily stand alone as its own appetizer but it was complementary with the bread!  I think that the bean dip was only a foreshadowing of the extreme attention to detail that the chef and owner shows when developing menu items.      I had the zucchini bisque and wild mushroom flatbread both of which were perfect and my wife had the pumpkin ravioli that was incredibly accentuated by cinnamon sprinkle julienned apples.  Both of our meals were incredible.  Additionally the pumpkin ravioli was a seasonal replacement for the standard ravioli.  The waiter was OK (not bad but not great) but the owner/manager came around and spoke with everyone and definitely reinforced our opinion that this places really cares about the quality it puts out!      I can't wait to go back and try the new seasonal additions to the menu!",

    "text": "My first impression upon walking in was that the restaurant was not very well organized.  They may have had employees call off, which happens, but there were only two people manning several tables and so I had to wait ten minutes to be seated.  The service was good, my bread, soup and appetizers came in a decent amount of time and all the food was very delicious and very well made.  All fresh ingredients, quality foods, nothing frozen.  My entree took a while to come, longer than it should have but I was still kept well informed by the young lady waiting on me.  I had the Bucicini which was a type of tube spaghetti tossed with olive oil and butter, garlic, bay scallops, tiger shrimp, mussels, shaved parmesan and arugula.  Truly delicious, outstanding combination of flavors and again, all fresh ingredients.  The only problem I had with the food was the price.  I thought $26 for this plate of food was a little overpriced.  I've had pasta plates in the middle of San Diego with twice as much meat for less than $20.    Final word: the food is excellent, but they're trying to emulate a five star restuarant when they shouldn't be.  They are located in a quaint part of town where their prices are too high for the area.  The price range for Yelp falls under \"Moderate\", I thought it was more expensive than Moderate.",

As others have noted, big serving sizes (= yummy lunch next day!) and BYOB (corkage fee per person but they don't pour your wine... in which case I think it should be per bottle). This is our current go-to place for celebrations. A little more than we usually pay for a dinner but nice as a treat! They were out of several dishes the night we went, so be sure to check availability if you have a favorite.",

    "text": "The prices are way too high for what you get.  The Bruco & Shrimp entree costs $26, yet the dish wasn't anything special.  The pasta was soft and the sauce was bland, although the shrimp were definitely plump.  We also ordered the Duck Breast, which was better, but the proportions were odd.  The bed of mashed potatoes that the duck was laid on was disproportionately huge, which might be great for people who want volume but not so much for people expecting a balanced dish.  The space and ambiance is charming, save for some questionable artwork.  Our waiter was a bit strange, although I won't hold it against the restaurant because he might have been new.  In addition to flubbing our order a bit, he asked us if we wanted cheese once the pasta dish came out, grated maybe 1/4 teaspoon of cheese (no exaggeration), and declared \"that's good\" and left.   Again, the food is ok and there wasn't anything overtly negative about our experience, but the price/value proposition means I really can't recommend this place.",

    "text": "I wanted to like Sausalido, I really did.  I had talked to the chef at Gooski's one night last spring and when the groupons came out i was excited to get one.  My girlfriend and I went on a weeknight, which was also one of the last days that we were eligible to use the groupon.  Per standard groupon procedure, the place was packed.  We spoke to the Chef while he was out front smoking and he said, \"it was a crazy night\" and they had been \"slammed\" because of the groupon.    We had a reservation and were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation time which I didn't think was too bad.  Sausalido is BYOB and they seemed surprised that we did not bring wine.  We were served a white bean dip to snack on and it was incredible.  I would have been much happier with our dinner if it would have been only that.    I ordered the shrimp and gazpacho shooters appetizer and was pleased at how quickly we received it and its taste.  The bowls it was served in were strange because it was too much to shoot but difficult to get a spoon into.  No matter though, they were fantastic.    I ordered the London Broil ($26) and my girlfriend got the pork chop ($23).  We were served small dinner salads with beets and it was so bad I don't even want to think about it.  My girlfriend's pork chop was good, but didn't blow her away.  My london broil was.....strange.  I really don't have another word for it.  It just seemed like a bad piece of meat.    For dessert we ordered the red velvet cheesecake and it was practically frozen and had tastes of mint.  I tried to enjoy it but I was pushing more and more of it onto my girlfriend.  The dinner was promising at the start, but went downhill fast.    I'm sorry for the simple review, but dinner at Sausalido did not provide lasting memories and we were clearly disappointed as we left.  Based on other reviews I can only assume that I went on a bad night, but it was bad enough that I will not go back.  I have too many other places in Pittsburgh to try.",

I ordered the mushroom ravioli with caesar salad as my starter.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon with the beet salad as his starter.  We brought a bottle of wine and I was happy that our corkage fee was a reasonable price ($4).  We both really enjoyed our meals.  I also really liked our waitress, who was very attentive and friendly.    The atmosphere is fine: not great, but not bad.  I would say there were a few too many fake flowers for my liking but honestly it didn't overly detract from the dining experience.   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back again!  We just need to start getting more people here to ensure its success!",

Celebrating a birthday party for a family friend, I was able to sample a variety of items off of the menu.  For appetizers, the calamari, mussels, and stuffed portobello mushrooms were outstanding.  Rather than being fried, the calamari was sauteed and served with a pesto sauce along with other vegetables.  The mussels were cooked to perfection in a tomato based broth, and I must admit that they were by far better than Point Brugge Cafe's signature dish.  The mushrooms were stuffed with quinoa and paired with cherry tomatoes that provided excellent contrasts in both taste and texture to the meaty mushrooms.    For main courses, I was lucky enough to taste the ricotta gnocchi with lamb ragout, the daily risotto with chicken and other vegetables, along with the seared scallops.  Of all the risotto was the most outstanding, but all of the dishes were equally tasty.  It was very hard selecting an entree since all sounded delicious.    Desert was equally amazing with tastings of a macadamia nut bread pudding and an apple cider creme brulee.  Sausilido is easily one of the best places in the city offering innovative cuisine at reasonable prices.  I will be looking forward to many more excellent meals here.",

I had the peach-stuffed chicken, which was delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated nicely. It was a huge portion. I requested mushroom risotto that came with a different dish rather than the squash risotto that was supposed to come with my dish. It was excellent. My husband had the London Broil. It tasted good and also was a generous portion, but the plating/presentation was pretty bad.   The biggest thumbs down is the decor. It's not very warm or especially comfortable, and there are a lot of tables in a small space. (In fact, it was through overhearing the woman at the adjacent table order that I had the idea to swap the risottos.)   At times our service was great, with the waitress stopping by often to refill our water etc., and other times during the meal we were wondering where she was, especially when it was time to pay and we wanted to leave. The owner or manager stopped at our table before we left to ask about our experience.  Overall, it is a nice restaurant with wonderful food, but there's nothing pulling me back right away.",

The risotto was the best I've ever had, hands down. The staff couldn't have been nicer, especially Jules, who treated us like family. From our first contact with the restaurant, Erika (the event coordinator) was fantastic to work with: responsive and very flexible. The response to everything we wanted to order or do was \"Yes\".

We ordered the Brussels sprouts appetizer to split across 3 people. It's cheesy, something we didn't expect.  They ran out of duck and trout (daily special) so we got pork chops, swordfish, and salmon instead.   My boyfriend's cousin said the salmon was a 4.8/5 stars because the feta on top was delicious.  My boyfriend said the swordfish was good.   I ordered the pork chop and thought it was well cooked and juicy. A little bit oily for my taste, but good nonetheless.

I noticed the restaurant Sausalido and a block or so up the street they had a booth with two offerings - stuffed meatballs or a pasta dish with feta cheese.  We both opted for the meatballs which had red and green peppers, bacon, Romano cheese and some other things.   We each got two large meatballs.   The sauce on them was delicious and they weren't drowning in it.   We were both satisfied with how filling they were and opted to get ice cream instead of looking for another food item.

We had a great time celebrating a birthday here and will absolutely return, likely when they change to the next seasonal menu.

It was my birthday and we had reservations, when we got there, there was an empty table for 4 and they said it was a 15 min wait , so we waited (only to be seated at that table). Then after we sat it took another 15 for the waitress to come open our wine bottle and bring us water. Thennnnn our food was pretty lackluster. My bf and I loved the JUMBO crab cakes and risotto before, but the past 2 times we went they got smaller and smaller. I was shocked how little they were tonight, like the size of medium 2 shrimps(don't call them jumbo when there baby size, then charge 25$). And the risotto was so watery. I was embarrassed that I recommended this place to our friends (as I'm writing this they legit just walked in from Wendy's bc neither of them liked their meal either). I never write bad reviews and feel bad doing this but what the heck sausalido, get ur stuff together. I'm not even going to go into how bad the bacon pickles were or the Gouda was..... but I felt like they're big fans of microwaves there.",

    "text": "Had food catered from Sausalido. Overall was ok. I'm not sure of the specific dish names, but I'll try to describe them.  Some kind of baked chicken: Not good. Really dry, not flavorful at all. This dish alone would have been a 1 star.  Salad - basic greens with garbanzo beans, tomatoes, carrots, onions, beets, and I think cranberries? I enjoyed it. Beets aren't super common in what seemed like a house salad, also liked the berries, gave it a nice contrast.  Pasta salad - pretty standard, not great, not bad.  Some kind of flank steak - this dish was really good actually. Really moist and flavorful. By far the best dish of everything we got. Only reason why my overall review isn't lower.",

    "text": "Edward, the host and my waiter, was quite charming and attentive. He was able to make wonderful recommendations, has impeccable timing and manners, and ask while flying seemlessly and effortlessly to all of his appointed tables (all this while hosting simultaneously! ).          At Edwards recommendation I started off with the gouda and also some red mussels, followed  by a house salad with very excellent balsamic dressing, and the crab cakes.        The chef  (Mike I believe the waiter said his name was) and his kitchen help have left nothing to chance.        The gouda was inexplicably delicious, while not being too filling. The red mussels are to die for, especially the exorbitant sauce.         The crab cakes, served on a bed of risotto, we're without a doubt the absolute best (more crab than cake with the risotto cooked to perfection.          The fresh cheese cake, served with fresh strawberries, blue berries and a caramel reduction, was an absolutely wonderful way to end the meal.        If I had any complaint, it was that the portion sizes were a bit large. However, they make for an excellent selling point for any date night.       All in all the quaint, intimate atmosphere, combined with the delectable apps, entrees, and desserts; and of course the fabulous service....makes this a must for all serious and nonchalant foodies or casual diners alike.  PS I would definitely make reservations Thursday through Saturday, and request to be seated on Edwards section.  He was phenomenal!!!!",

Didn't really like being asked about it.  I don't think she was rude or anything but she was clearly just a kooky kind of girl who make sure everyone in the dining room knew she was great friends with her co worker Ed. So I guess it's good that the staff gets along!  The bean dip was excellent but the strip steaks were pure gristle, order the crab cakes.  I don't think I'll be coming back here but this place seems popular and everyone I know loves the food so I can only assume I was there on an off night.",

If the smell doesn't turn you away the minute you walk in the door Rosie O'Donnel's twin sister Bertha the no clue what it means to be a server at a restaurant that fancies itself to be a \"fine dining\" establishment waitress will.  I get tired of telling hippie chefs that grew up \"dining\" at Eatin' Park, went through the culinary arts program at Allegany Community  College and now think that this justifies them charging $29 for a bowl of Orrichetti, how to run their restaurants but here I go again. Dude (it is dude isn't it?) cooking isn't brain surgery. Ninety percent of your customers can cook at home just as well as you can. People don't go out to dinner for the food. They go to be pampered, to feel special, to feel welcome and to have their ass kissed. I spend all day kissing my customers asses so when I go out to cut loose with some hard earned coin it's time for someone to reciprocate. Pucker up baby daddy's home.

    "text": "With all of the amazing restaurant options in Pittsburgh, you can do far better than Sausalido.  I want to begin this review by saying that what really upset my group was the bad service and overall unprofessional nature of the staff.  We overheard a member of the kitchen staff using profanity to describe our table, and it was obvious that they all just wanted us to leave (we had a later reservation on a Friday night). However, our server literally disappeared for a half an hour after clearing our table, so we couldn't have paid if we wanted to (which we desperately did at that point - they seriously made us feel so uncomfortable).  I saw on another review that someone's experience was interrupted with a screaming match between the kitchen and the front of the house, so it's my guess that professionalism isn't really paramount here.   So, now on to the actual food.  The white bean dip, which everyone raves about, was definitely great and a nice touch.  The entrees ranged from not that great to pretty good.  The menu itself just wasn't very interesting and there were few unique items listed.  Someone at my table had pumpkin ravioli, which were obviously filled with canned pumpkin that was probably bought at Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle.  I guess it's hard to expect fresh pumpkin at this time of year though! (Which is why it probably shouldn't be on the menu... but I digress.)  Overall, the menu was average, the food was mediocre, and the service was deplorable.  If you're looking for a great BYO Italian restaurant at this price range, there are far, far better options.  E2, Piccolo Forno, or even La Tavola on Mt. Washington come to mind... do yourself a favor and go to one of those!",

Everything on the menu appealed to me, which is always a good sign. Oh yeah, also a good sign, deliciuos bread and hummus on the table!  I was with a party of six and as soon as our food came out, I was struck by what a beautiful presentation it was. I mean, everything looked fresh and delicious, with a lovely looking plating to boot! I was in the mood for veggies, so I choose the roasted veggie wrap. It came LOADED with portabella mushrooms, red pepper, yellow squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrot, mixed greens, parmesan and white bean spread in a spinach tortilla. I also loved the balsamic dressing inside. It was just a nice refreshing meal for lunch. Not too heavy and definitely on the healthy side.  I was VERY intrigued by the dinner menu though. I must come back soon to get some of the seasonal items (yum pumpkin!).",

Not a terribly interesting menu, but the owner and service were friendly, the food seemed predictably good, and the value was good as well. On the other hand, the interior is slightly dated and our window table in the window was so cold that I had to keep my jacket on.  We started our meal with the roasted sprouts - which didn't really taste roasted (outsides weren't caramelized) - but were covered in cheese, so were still pretty good. We had the pork and the steak for our entrees, and while they weren't notably amazing, they were cooked and seasoned well...and the portions were enormous.   I'm not sure if we would make Sausalido a destination, but I would eat here again if I'm in the neighborhood and want a nicer meal.",

    "text": "Easily 5 stars: delicious food, salad/bread included in the entree, attentive service, and BYOB  Their prices are extremely reasonable for what you get - huge portions that you leave more than satisfied and every entree includes a starter salad and bread with bean dip, similar to a hummus, that's loaded with tomatoes and balsamic vinegar.  I feel like the majority of BYOBs in Pittsburgh are a range of Asian restaurants or generic Italian, but Pittsburgh needs more BYOBs like Sausalido. Their menu is creative and well-rounded with seasonal specials with something to please everyone - seafood, pasta, steak. I ordered the crab cakes - crispy on the outside with the perfect ratio of crab to filling, and it comes with a rich and flavorful risotto. I would definitely order it again, but I'm also tempted by almost every entree on the menu!",

    "text": "I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and her parents.  We had an 8:30 reservation and arrived a few minutes early only to be told that they were 15 minutes behind schedule and that we could wait outside or at the bar next door.  This wasn't the most thrilling option for us as we did not want to go to the bar which meant that we we stuck outside with all of the smokers from the nearby bar which we thoroughly despised.  At first I was pretty peeved by our wait but as the host repeatedly apologized for the delay throughout the night and I realized that they had a 40+ person wedding party upstairs and a 20 top downstairs, it easily became apparent that they were not really to blame.  The restaurant itself is fairly quaint with the tables being made from slate(?) with some inlaid artwork and also some other local artwork for sale on the walls.  Having been here before we knew that Sausilido was BYOB and brought in our own bottle for a nominal $2/person corkage fee which the waiter opened while telling us about the daily fish and risotto specials.  Our group decided to start off our evening smoked gouda.  Before it was delivered to the table we received the local bread and bean dip that is served with all of their entrees.  The bread was nice and the bean dip even better which led to be it being finished before our appetizer even made it to the table.  The gouda was served with a crust on the outside and was topped off by some pesto while sitting on a bed of spinach.  It came sans bread which our table thought was odd but may have been due to the fact that we already ate all of ours.  Once we tasted it though, the bread was not missed as it was both savory and delicious which allowed it to be enjoyed by our whole party.  Shortly after our appetizer was finished, the salads that came with all of the entrees were delivered.  They were decent sized and dressed in a tasty vinegarette.  I really enjoyed it, especially the beets which you so rarely get on house salads.   For my entree I had a tough time deciding between the hangar steak and duck breast before ultimately settling on the hangar steak.  Whenever our entrees came out, everyone at the table commented on how large they were.  I was also surprised to see that in addition to the steak, bacon horseradish creme fraiche and warm potato salad that was described on the menu, they had garnished my dish with a sizable portion of roasted cauliflower and red peppers.  All of my dish was excellent with the warm potato salad tasting awesome while the steak was cooked perfectly and the extra vegetables being good as well.  My only complaint would be the large scoop of creme fraiche that seemed ladled onto my steak.  That in itself would not have been too bad except for the fact that the horseradish seemed to be heavy in it and overpowered all of the other flavors.  Thankfully I enjoy horseradish and so did not find it to be too horrible even though it was even a bit much for me on several of the pieces that I had eaten.  With all of the food that we had eaten, we were not able to order dessert and even passed on our planned trip to the nearby froyo store afterward.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  Every time that I come to this place I am reminded of why I constantly have it as one of my top 5 restaurants in the 'burgh.",

I'm always a fan of BYOB places...so there's that.  The place is small but the service is very quick and eager (perhaps too much...she checked on us way too much and there was a definite feeling of her trying really hard to come across as super friendly and nice. It kind of felt like she was part of our conversations). It has a friendly atmosphere and a comfortable vibe to it.  My boyfriend got the pork chops which I'm never a fan of but it was well prepared and the cabbage/mashed potato bed it was on was delicious. Reminded me of a German eisbein.  I got the beet and bleu cheese salad and it was delicious.  Wayyyyyyy too many beets but I love a little beet dish by itself so I'm really not complaining. Really, it's a great salad. I also got the mussel appetizer and they were the biggest mussels I've ever seen. The only negative is that they were extremely gritty and I felt way too many times like I was crunching on sand and I couldn't finish as it was turning my stomach.  Side note: they have an interesting dip for their bread...a white bean puree in balsamic vinegar and oil. It would have been better had they 86ed the white bean puree. Just really an addition without adding anything.",

I can't believe I've been coming to Bloomfield for years to eat at Lot 17 which is right next door and I hadn't ventured into this fabulous place. Little did I know what I was missing. Terrific food that's fresh, imaginative, well prepared, and super tasty. The place appears small as you approach, a narrow nondescript building on Liberty Avenue. The downstairs seating area probably holds 12 tables or so but there's an upstairs dining area as well. There are specials listed on the chalkboard as you enter but I noticed that they were out of at least one of them quite early (7:00) one Saturday night. Could have been a fluke or maybe the monkfish special was extremely popular early. But rest assured, there's enough on the regular menu to satisfy your hunger and your distinguished palate  We started with the grilled asparagus and goat cheese appetizer and the smoked gouda with sauteed spinach. Both excellent choices. They serve a complimentary bean dip that is out of this world. Had me wanting more.  I ordered the hangar steak over a warm malt Dijon potato salad (you have to taste this - I could eat a gallon of this!). It was so well prepared, sliced thinly and cooked to a tender perfection. Oh my. My wife ordered the bucicini, a bowl full of hollow pasta with shrimp, mussels, bay scallops, broccoli, arugula, and shaved parmesan. Yum. It was HUGE. (LEFTOVERS!!!) Our dinner partner ordered the two jumbo, lump crab cakes over a bed of lemon zucchini risotto. She loved them! I'm ordering those next time.  We didn't have room for dessert (but we did for more wine) but the chocolate peanut butter creme brulee would have been my choice. I'm going back for sure. And I'll save room for dessert!",

Tables are kind of tight in the downstairs dining area, but it gives a quaint feel.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  Due to the relative size of the place, I would recommend making a reservation in advance.  This restaurant is also a BYOB place, which is awesome.  The menu is not overly elaborate, but offers a good amount of options when it comes to your protein for the main course.  They offer a pork chop, crap cakes, hangar steak, seafood specials (salmon, monkfish), shrimp risotto and duck.  They also have a pasta option as well as an squash lasagna.  Our table ordered around the menu and everything was cook fantastically.  Judging by the empty plates, I think it is a safe assumption that everyone loved their meals.  The staff here is quite prompt and friendly.  Very efficient when it came to refilling waters, clearing plates and most importantly, opening when necessary.  Everyone was fantastic.  One item of note, if you are in a group of 6 or more, gratuity is automatically included in your bill.  You receipt will still show your 'tipping' options at the bottom, so just be aware it was already included, but feel free to tip more!  This is a great little BYOB spot in Bloomfield.  Each time I have been here I have never been disappointed.  I will certainly be returning.",

Not ONCE she asked if we needed anything including very much needed water in this crammed poorly ventilated room.  We made the crucial mistake to order pork chop. This took more than  1.5 hours. I left for a little time to move outside and breathe. Meanwhile we had to literally hunt someone down for a water refill. After an hour, we were told that pork chops took at least 45 min. I add that we got salad that is part of the meal. One was served in a bowl. One in a small ice cream cup!  The salad consisted of dressing with some salad stuff in it and the bowl was totally dirty.  Once food arrived, I really couldn't breathe. So we asked for the check. It arrived but we were charged for the wrong meal which was $4 more expensive that what I ordered..chicken. I couldn't take it.  So we bailed out.  We also observed similar frustrations on all the nearby tables. Including a charred steak that was not edible.  Food was only ok.",

Our reservation was at 6:45 on a Friday evening, but we arrived half an hour early and were still seated right away. I wish I remember our server's name, she was fantastic. Genuine, helpful, attentive and personable - but most importantly, non-intrusive.  We brought several bottles of wine and spent three hours eating delicious food, chatting it up and just really enjoying the atmosphere. It's very intimate, a quiet place - although after all the wine was gone, we were making an effort to keep the volume low.  We split the smoked gouda appetizer, and that was a great idea. It comes over sauteed spinach and it was fantastic. The special of the day was shark and my friends were obsessed. They raved about it. I did the shrimp risotto and I couldn't have been happier. I took half of it home, as the portions are huge (and it was just as good at 10am). It also comes with a side salad that doesn't disappoint either. - or you can sub soup for $2. Either way, great options. And then we had dessert, which never happens - but staring at pictures on Yelp all day and we couldn't help ourselves. The caramel cheesecake was beyond delicious. I honestly don't think anything on the menu would have been a bad idea.  Our check ended up being less than $37 a person - which is just amazing for the great service and full three courses plus added soup/coffee and the cork fees. I think you should eat here immediately.",

We got together with some family for Easter pre-game and I was not happy we were trying this place but decided to try and make the most of it. And then a while later I was stripped of my socks when my meal arrived. I got the carb cakes and cheddar broccoli risotto and oh wow. The crab cakes were all lump crab deliciousness. The risotto was chessy yumminess. Even the salad was fantastic. It has beets in which my not appeal to some but I loved. The BF got the seared tuna, which is not for me but he thoroughly enjoyed. Two people got the sausage pasta and that was amazing. The pasta was clearly homemade, a lost art in my opinion, and the sausage was quoted as \"the best I've ever had\" by one of the woman who ordered it. We didn't get desert because of the amount of Easter candy littering the table but I can only imagine how I would haw the tuxedo cake. The place is small and very quaint, with lots of interesting furniture, and our waitress was so nice and accommodating. I love the atmosphere which is the the din of forks on plates and some lite jazz or something playing in the background. No loud music and college students acting like fools. I cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal. I would highly encourage you to try it as well.",

    "text": "I don't even know if I have the words to describe how awesome-sauce my Sausalido catering experience was for our wedding, but I'll give it a try!    Every step of the process, from tasting to day-of, Nick was professional, friendly, and no-nonsense.  We told him upfront what we wanted to spend, and he gave us amazing food and service at an even MORE amazing price.  He also didn't try to nickel and dime us like so many vendors involved in the wedding industry try to do.  Nick let us know immediately of different price options (for example, how much more colored linens are compared to black) and even gave very helpful suggestions on what we didn't need to spend money on (buying our pop rather than have a caterer provide it at an inflated price).  Because our venue did not have a kitchen, all the food was made at the restaurant and brought over.  I worried about food drying out, getting cold, etc. - all for naught as all the food was the perfect temperature and moist.  Much care was taken with the display of food, including mirrors and flowers to accentuate and complement what was to be served.  Nick also worked with All Occasions to rent the plates and silverware, using his industry discount to again save us a few bucks.  He was even nice enough to bring all the ice we needed for the beer and pop!  As if all this wasn't enough, Nick was actually at the venue the day-of and oversaw the set-up process.  This was very reassuring and also shows how much he truly cares about producing a quality product and service.    So many of our guests raved to me about the delicious food.  I give Nick and Sausalido my highest recommendation, and I know I will select Sausalido again for any future catering needs!",

He was the perfect mix of present at the right moment, funny, and interested in interacting with us while not feeling intrusive or aloof.   We tried a few different dishes. To start we had a reservation so the table was already ready with bread and a white bean dip for when we arrived (nice touch). This was delicious and a great alternative to the basic bread and butter.   Then we ordered the cream of mushroom soup and the smoked Gouda appetizer. We were floored! Now the cream of mushroom soup was a misnomer, because there wasn't much cream, though this is not a complaint. The soup was a delicious blend of mushrooms which gave it a delicious richness without the heaviness of cream. As good as the mushroom soup was the Gouda was better. This is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I loved the creaminess of the cheese and the brightness of the vinaigrette.   For our entrees I ordered the duck and my husband ordered the ricotta gnocchi. He loved his pasta, though it wasn't really for me (personal preference) and my duck was so delicious! I loved the duck and the sauce, but I couldn't even touch the mashed potatoes after all of the delicious food we had!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu! BYOB was also a big plus!",

    "text": "Great lunch catering. I couldn't recommend it enough--a variety of sandwiches, salads, cookies, chips--really impressive.  I probably won't go back for dinner, though, and it pains me to say it because I love living in Bloomfield and I love Bloomfield businesses. A group of eight of us decided to check this place out for restaurant week, and even though the $25.15 menu didn't look all that impressive, we figured it would be a nice taste of what they had to offer.  The meatballs were a bit dry and the sauce was a bit unimpressive. The salad was great (I love beets). The risotto was bland and undercooked. The pumpkin ravioli tasted like canned pumpkin pie filling; the cream-sauce was either not a good complement or not spiced well or something (I can't quite put my finger on it, and it wasn't bad, it was just...there). Before our meal, they brought out a white bean dip with some bread--this was the highlight of the night, aside from the wine we brought ourselves. Our waitress was extremely nice and down-to-earth, and kudos for being patient with our larger party.  I guess my concern is that if you're going to bother offering a restaurant week deal, why wouldn't you serve something wonderful that you're especially proud of? A few of the people in our party ordered something off the menu rather than getting the special, and they really enjoyed their meals.   They won't split large-party checks and only use up to four cards on one check. We also stayed past our welcome--by the time we left, all staff were in the back, and we were alone in the front of the restaurant.",

The servers were friendly, made recommendations, and were prompt with their service.  There are some vegetarian options, which is always nice to see. At the time they had a special appetizer of arancini (fried balls of risotto). I love arancini, so of course I ordered them, but what came out was not at all what I was expecting. They were dry, floury cakes that seemed like they never were risotto. It was very unpleasant.  I looked at their menu just now and feel like I could be persuaded to try again, so stay tuned.",

The salads were swimming in dressing (I couldn't eat it), and where was the kale? It was basically romaine and dressing. The ravioli was yummy, but the sauce was so thin/ runny that it wouldn't  'stick' to the pasta- I wanted a thicker heartier sauce.

The food is rich and flavorful. On recent trips I have had the Duck Breast, Crab Cakes and Squash Lasagne. Each was cooked perfectly, and the portions were very large. Also, you get a very rustic serving of bread with a white bean, gouda and balsamic dip. This is insanely addictive, You could almost eat that as a meal itself.   The staff could not be more friendly. Cheerful, attentive and talkative, It's almost like having a family meal. The real gem here though is Chef Mike Smith. He is as affable as he is talented. He makes it a point to come out of the kitchen and talk and greet his guests.   The place is BYOB, which is fine, though the corking fee seems a bit excessive. Otherwise, I've had nothing but extremely positive experiences here.",

    "text": "Recently redeemed a Groupon during our first--and, unfortunately, probably last--trip to Sausalido.  Let me just get this out of the way first... Something that was impossible to ignore during our dinner and now as I'm writing this review was a very audible disagreement that occurred between the kitchen and the front of the house.  It lasted nearly 5 minutes and changed the tone of our experience.  Sausalido's dining room is about the size of my living room, and there's no substantial separation of the dining room and the kitchen, not even a door.  We heard everything; how could we not?  When the hostess/waitress returned to our table with our salads she was visibly shaken, and we couldn't help but feel bad, but, I'm sorry, we shouldn't have to be troubled with those kinds of emotions during our dinner.  It was unfortunate and uncomfortable, to say the least.  Another thing that was odd was that one of the cooks, at least twice during our time at the restaurant, walked through the dining room and out the front door to sit at one of the chairs outside.  No doubt this bustling section of Liberty Avenue makes for some good people-watching, but I'm not sure it's professional for staff to draw attention to themselves by walking the length of the dining room and using the front door during service.  Now about those salads.  They were really fantastic!  I loved the addition of beets at no charge, the fresh mixed greens, and the wonderful house-made salad dressings.  Loved that the entrees come with salads, in addition to some a-little-too-mayo-y-tasting white bean dip that's served with a few slices of rather plain, spongey bread.  Our entrees were flavorful and nicely executed and plated, while the condiments on the baked smoked gouda appetizer seemed out of place but were tasty nevertheless.  Aforementioned heated argument aside, service was nice and very efficient.  I did notice one slight insincerity though, which involved the daily risotto.  Early on the waitress described the creole chicken and bleu cheese risotto as soooo good, but then, a little later when we ordered, admitted that she hadn't tasted the risotto after I asked if the dish was spicy.  Lastly, Sausalido's corkage fee is a mere $2 per person, and they sell no alcoholic beverages.  During dinner we regretted not bringing a bottle.",

This was alright but was essentially a fancied-up mozzarella stick in a block of cheese. It came with some spinach that was incredibly salty. (One of my roommates got the goat-cheese stuffed peppers and said it was actually quite good.)  The salad came next. It was overdressed, only ok, and thoroughly forgettable.  For the entree, I got the bacon wrapped meatloaf. I think that a home chef who didn't quite know how to make this dish would've made it in the same way. Dry, salty, and nothing interesting about it. One of my roommates got the seafood casserole -- there was no discernible pieces of seafood and just tasted like overcooked, sorta cheesy pieces of pasta (shells?).  Even the BYOB was slightly disappointing -- it is listed as \"corkage fee included\" for the Restaurant Week menu, but that did not seem to be the case when we went.  The best part of the meal was the white bean dip with crostini that was set on the table even before we arrived (slightly weird?).  As is, Sausalido, for me, is not worth returning to.",

We were quickly seated and a waiter saw our wine bottle (it's BYOB) and opened it for us.  We ordered the prosciutto pickle spears. Hubs wanted the tuna and I opted for the crab cakes, but alas no tuna was available. Hubs wanted risotto, so I swapped for the duck so he could get the crab cakes. All is well in the world again.  Bread, with bean dip and balsamic arrives. It's an interesting option and we enjoyed it. The prosciutto pickle spears arrive and we were surprised to see full pickles. We had imagine the little pickles. As such, the prosciutto was overpowered by the pickle. It was still tasty, but not something I could have a lot of. The salads arrive and is a good mix of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, salad, and chickpeas. I didn't realize we were getting salads with the meals and I would have specified dry. Not a fan of oil or dressing on salads. I made do.  We finished the salads and wait. Our entrees are taking a bit. Hubs go to the restroom and overhears a manager yelling at the kitchen staff that he needs those crab cakes out now. Now we know the hang up and why others who came after us got their entrees first. They could have told us and we could have ordered something else, but no one did. At this point, we're almost finished with our bottle of wine. We preserve the final glass for the entrees. When they came, the crab cakes were sizable and with good flavor. The duck was good, but fatty. There was little meat, leaving me a bit hungry, so I stole some crab cake. The risotto was underwhelming and not cooked well. It tasted like standard rice and not the care required in slow cooking risotto.  As we were wrapping up, the waitress offers a dessert since it's a birthday dinner. I opted for the flourless chocolate cake. It's dense and tasty. Perfect way to cap it off.  We were hoping to head out as it is now 9:40. We've been there for while. The waitress is talking to other guests for 10 minutes, so we were waiting again to get the check. It's a swift process and we head out.   The food is good, with plenty of options. The service was spotty and we weren't sure what to make of it. They were friendly, but we didn't get the wait and such.",

    "text": "Highly recommend this restaurant! First impressions: quaint, homey, warm. The smell of lit candles filled the room! Really liked the atmosphere. The wait staff was great and attentive. Our waitress introduced herself then told us that every dish is made from scratch including all their sauces. Every dish was excellent. I don't have anything else to say other than I was rather impressed. I'm extremely excited to come again and try different dishes and seasonal menus. I suggest making a reservation!   Starters: *ask for extra bread to pair with the two* -Smoked Gouda: My favorite of the 2. Every element of this appetizer contributed to the experience of eating this piece of cheese. I loved the encrusted wheat finish and the pesto and balsamic together.  -Rosie's Meatballs: I could tell they were from scratch - from the 3 large meatballs to the sauce. Very good  Entrees: -Lump Crabcakes: WOW. All components of this dish were delicious from the creamy risotto to the buttery crabcakes to the rich tartar sauce. I think the decision for a broccoli cheese risotto was a value add  -Hangar Steak: My friend ordered medium well and it came out exactly as he wished. I took a bite and although I'm not a medium-well girl, I still enjoyed it. I really liked the quality of the steak itself   Other random tip: BYOB (cork fee $2 per person)",

Every person working at the restaurant was thoughtful, attentive, and flexible. The decor, cleanliness, and location were also all really good.   Unfortunately, my main hesitations with this restaurant were some of the food items. My favorite thing was a fried cheese appetizer and my side of smashed/mashed potatoes. The cheese was amazing and devoured immediately, but we also ordered other appetizers including the Brussels sprouts and potatoes. For entrees our table had steak, crab cakes, and tuna. All of these food items were mediocre. They tasted okay and were generally eaten, but I wasn't too impressed. Most of the leftover food was left on the table.   I really want this place to do well and improve, but the restaurant was almost empty when we were there and I'm concerned it will eventually close down, even though I feel like it has a lot of potential.  I heard they have a good deal for two entrees during the week, but as of now I don't have any strong urges to go back.",

In particular, I really enjoyed the white truffled deviled eggs, Rosie's stuffed meatballs, and the beef skewers. Everything else was not far behind though. I would really recommend them to anyone looking for some more gourmet type catering and I really look forward to trying more from them at future events!",

They were courteous enough to call earlier in the day to let us know that we would have to wait. We started with bread and bean dip that was delicious, but the smoked gouda was my favorite appetizer. Everyone ordered something different so I got to taste a few different things and everything was seasoned/ cooked to perfection. It's also BYOB, so don't forget to bring a bottle of wine to have with your meal (or a 6 pack of beer if you're like me). I'll definitely be back here becausr they have just enough vegetarian options to leep me interested. The mushroom risotto was my favorite entree.",

    "text": "Since this is just an update I won't bore you with anything other than the highlights.  Service: better this time. We were in no way rushed through our meal and enjoyed ourselves for a little over two hours. She was helpful with suggestions and efficient with removing plates from the table.   Complimentary white bean hummus with balsamic vinegar and red peppers: Very flavorful as per usual. We were offered seconds but declined to not fill up on bread.  Spiced gala apple spread with mascarpone goat cheese honey  and crostini- there were only five small pices and six of us so portion size needs to be considered if you have more than five people. The crostini was WAY too hard and hurt my teeth chewing it. The spiced cinnamon apples were amazingly flavorful and nicely complemented the drizzled honey. The goat cheese was tasty and added a unique profile to enhance the sweet apples.  Smoked Gouda(sage wheat-encrusted smoked Gouda , sauteed spinach, sun dried tomatoes, pesto , balsamic reduction)- one of my favorite appetizers ever! Smoky with a hint of nuts and slightly sweet from the sun dried tomatoes. Excellent as always. If you only get one appetizer here get this!   Complimentary salad- no dressing choice this time. Beets and pickled onions were nice additions.  Crab cakes with zucchini risotto and housemade remoulade- very meaty, little to no filler. Large portion. Zucchini risotto was creamy and prepared perfectly.   Roasted Duck breast with cranberry orange reduction and aged broccoli cheddar hash- the duck was so tender! The skin was perfectly crisp! Portion was very large for both the duck and the hash. The cranberry orange reduction was quite unique when paired with the duck and offered a nice, sweet counterbalance for dipping. The broccoli cheddar hash was just homefries with cheddar and steamed broccoli. I'd suggest a different side dish be paired with this as it was just too simplistic with the more evolved flavors from the duck and reduction. It was seasoned well but just seemed out of place.  Frenched 16 oz. pork chop with roasted spice pear reduction and smoky blue cheese mashed potatoes- the pork chop was thick yet very tender. The pear reduction was a unique twist on the typical apple/chop combination. The blue cheese mash were tasty but on the runny side.   My review stands at 4 stars since I have had the chance to explore more in the US since my last review.  While not getting everything perfect, they get enough right to make this an always solid choice for an evening out.",

    "text": "I stopped by here with my wife on a Friday night for date night. This place caught my eye because they have an incredibly interesting menu that sounds healthy, fresh, and seasonal. After fighting Pittsburgh and Lawrenceville Friday traffic we were able to find an on street parking spot a block away from the restaurant. Inside had a nice romantic feel with some mood lighting. The entire restaurant is tiny so I'd recommend reservations just to be on the safe side.   Being BYOB with a $2/person corkage fee, my wife and I brought along a bottle of chardonnay to be fancy n'at. We were quickly seated upon arrival and our wine was opened and placed in a bucket of ice while we had a chance to look over the menu. I ended up picking the salmon with quinoa summer salad, and before our main dishes came out we were treated to a beautiful fresh salad with beats and a creamy rosemary (I think it was rosemary) dressing as well as a roasted red pepper and humus dip with balsamic dressing and freshly baked bread to dip. My wife is not a humus fan and had a fair helping of the dip, enough said. The salmon was excellent and the quinoa salad was a nice pairing minus the strawberries which I'm not sure fit that well with the dish. Either way it was great and my wife who ordered the duck which came with potatoes and a fall cooked apple side also tasted very good. The sweetness of the apple complimented the rich flavor of the duck.   We spent a good 2 hours here for dinner. I very much enjoyed the date, sipping on wine the whole time and eating basically a 3 course meal. The staff was very friendly and I think we'll be back here sometime even though Lawrenceville isn't easy to get to. Great place for a nicer date!!!",

    "text": "Sausalido is amazing! We had reservations here for my girlfriend's birthday on a Friday night, I was excited because I've never heard of it before and it had outstanding reviews. The inside of Sausalido is super tiny & charming. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, I knew I was going to love it!  When we arrived, we were seated quickly and greeted almost immediately by our waitress. Our waitress was so nice & took great care of us- which I'm sure was difficult since we were a group of 8 chatty girls with a few bottles of wine in us. Speaking of wine- Sausalido is BYOB! Can't beat that! We were also served fresh bread with a dipping sauce (almost like hummus) to start. We also ordered the smoked gouda and brie cheese as appetizers. Both cheese apps were fabulous!  After going over the menu a thousand times, I finally decided on the butternut squash ravioli as my entree. They have a seasonal menu here- so I wanted to try something different that I wouldn't typically order. All entrees are also served with a side salad but I asked to have a side Caesar salad instead. The Caesar salad tasted super fresh and simple- which I love. I also enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli. It was a lot more sweet and a lot less savory than I was expecting. I think this would have been a better dish to split between 2 or 3 people instead and order another meal as well. All of my girlfriends also loved their meals! A few girls got the risotto dish (I wish this is what I got!), another got salmon and the meatballs. This place is definitely a little gem in Bloomfield- I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "My husband chose this place for a date on a Friday night. Based on reviews and researching the menu, we were excited about the place, however not thrilled about the drive to get there. For a Friday, it didn't turn out too bad and we were able to find an on-street parking spot not far from the restaurant. The main street of the town is cute and full of restaurant options if we choose to head this way in the future.   Walking into the restaurant, it was smaller than I expected, however had very romantic, earthly feel to it.  We were greeted pleasantly by a waitress and she informed us that we could choose where we wanted to sit. As the place was pretty much full, we were limited on options but were able to find a table for two. Closely spaced with minimal walking space between each one, you could hear the conversation of the guests next to you. The table was set with candles and a rose in the center. As it was BYOB, our waitress was quick to open our bottle of wine and pour a class for each of us, placing the rest of the bottle in an ice bucket for when we wanted to refill later.   This menu was so exciting to me! I am not very adventurous when it comes to food, however, there were several options with a slight twist that sounded worth trying. We were started off with complimentary white bean hummus with dipping bread drizzled with balsamic vinegar. It was pretty tasty and a great way to begin dinner. After questioning the waitress on what to order, I ended up with the Pan Seared Duck Breast served over cubed roasted potatoes, and a side of fresh pears and apples. To my surprise the pear and apple combination was served cold but paired well with the rest of the dish. The waitress was kind enough to give us a side of Fettuccine Carbonara (the other dish I was torn between)  to share and man was it delicious! Large, freshly cut ham and bacon covered in a wonderful cream sauce. I was in heaven! My husband ordered the Salmon and Quinoa and thought it was good. The portions were large enough for me to take a small amount home for lunch the next day.   This place: wonderful ambiance, delicious food, exceptional service. I have a feeling we will be back in the future!",

Kind of late for dinner, but I think that was the only one available for a group as large as ours. Sausalido is BYOB and my group certainly brought our own booze.  Our waitress was patient and attentive and seemed to be having fun with the group of us.  Not many other parties were in the restaurant at the time we were, which was probably for the best.  We started with the smoked gouda, brussels, and candied apples and pears.  All were 5 stars.  I got their soup of the day which was a mushroom soup - kind of watery, but still good flavor after adding a bit of salt and pepper.  I then asked for them to make me a salmon caesar for my main course and the staff had no problem accommodating my request.  My salad was very good...and enormous.  Others got the butternut squash rav, wild mushroom risotto, crab cakes, and chicken.  Everything was amazing.  We ended the meal with a slice of chocolate fudge cake. Very rich and dense, but moist.  Definitely something to share.  Overall a wonderful experience with excellent food and the vino flowing.  I can't wait to come back!",

The service was a little slow, but it was great service.  The woman remembered everything we needed or asked for. I think she may have been the only server for all the tables.  There was some bus boy helper, but he didn't actually wait on the tables.   I got the tortellini with chicken and arugula and it was spot on delicious.  They only complaint was that it may have been a little too greasy.  But that made it taste pretty good, of course.  There was so much I had to take 1/2 of it home.     My friend got the duck, he said it was cooked fantastic and very good, but didn't care for the apples that came with it.  That was just his preference. I don't think it was anything regarding the way the apples tasted or were cooked.   My friend also got the homemade tomato and arugula soup.  It was very fresh and was a good mix of flavors.  We also got bread with white bean hummus and our side salads included with our meals.  Both were very tasty and excellent.    We finished it off with a ricotta berry dessert that came in chilled mason jar.  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  The portion was big and it was not sweetened.  Fresh berries and ricotta mixed together were a great simple combination.   Overall the experience was great and we will definitely be back.  You get great fresh food, big portions and good flavors.  Plus you are supporting a local restaurant.",

    "text": "Outstanding food, lovely ambiance, and excellent service. Had a truly delightful evening thanks to Sausalido!   We started off with bread and hummus-like spread, which was fantastic, and the smoked gouda and zucchini appetizers. The smoked gouda was basically a big fried melty gouda ball with pesto, and the zucchini was sprinkled with parm and had marinara sauce on the side. Delicious!  The main courses-- which were the best part, although it did take a little while to come out so be patient! It will be worth it-- were the pork, salmon, strip steak, and crab cakes. I tried a bite of everyone's entree, and each bite was  phenomenal. The pork (my favorite) was juicy and tender-- cooked perfectly.   The prices are a little on the higher side, but worth it especially for a special occasion. Reservations are highly recommended! They accept credit cards as well, which is another plus.  I can't wait to go back!",

A large bowl of delicious Rustic Italian bread bathed in olive oil and tasty seasonings, with thin slices of roasted red peppers and generous shavings of parmesan cheese was on our table when we arrived.  A fresh East Coast Caesar salad was our first course with a few large green olives and kalamata mixed in, (nice) along with what looked like large homemade croutons and again generous shavings of Parmesan cheese with a delicious and light Caesar salad dressing. A flavorful, fluffy Risotto with a plentiful mix of roasted vegetables was the starch we selected which was excellent. No gummy risotto here.  Two entrees were included in the price of our luncheon.  We chose a Roasted Boneless Lemon Chicken with Fresh Mozzarella which was the most tender and flavorful piece of chicken I think I've ever tasted.  Our second entree was a grilled Dill Salmon with a Tomato & Lemon Basil Aioli.  Dessert was cheese cake topped with mixed fresh berries.  If you want delicious food, freshly prepared and reasonably priced and don't care about a fancy decor this is the place for you.  I only wished I lived closer.  Sausalido would be the first place I would call to caterer a party.  Nick knows his stuff, I was impressed.",

I noticed the place has a very casual vibe to it. There was only 1 waitress serving almost an entirely full restaurant, which made me feel the service isn't up to the mark.  But I did enjoy the food. I really loved their complimentary bean dip and bread. The salad was wonderful too. I ordered the vegetarian pasta, and it was alright. I liked that it had a variety of fresh vegetables.   Overall, I felt the prices are a bit steep, the service is not up to the mark but the food can be really good for what you order.",

    "text": "Sausalido is truly a hidden gem in Bloomfield! Inventive, creative dishes, stellar service and BYOB. One can't ask much more. Reservations are recommended because it's not huge. I really like the upstairs space best because there's a bit more elbow room than downstairs, especially if you have a larger group.   You're greeted with a chalkboard of the evening's specials - typically a fish of the day and other seasonal specialties. It's easy to order off that menu. Love the bread and bean dip they bring to the table and the smoked Gouda appetizer is not to be missed. We've ordered it every time. You can choose a dinner salad portion of any of their options or their soup to begin your meal. I'm hooked on their Beets & Bleu Salad and it's perfectly sized as a starter.   Even though the menu changes regularly, the crab cakes are always there and they're delightful with a different flavor profile than a typical crab cake. My friend can't keep herself away from their pork chop which comes with a stellar presentation, as does their lamb. The fish special preparation changes regularly, too. We've also really enjoyed steak and pasta dishes.   On our last visit we actually saved room for dessert and shared their chocolate, caramel, cashew bread pudding. Wow, it was amazing!  Service during every visit has been perfect and our wine glasses never seem to be empty. Great restaurant!",

It was restaurant week, so they offered a limited menu, we all head the quinoa meatballs, which took some getting use to, but we ended up enjoying them. They brought a house salad course next that I felt was unnecessary. The white balsamic vin was really good. The final course was an option of stuffed pumpkin ravioli with honey crisp apple cream sauce or the daily risotto. Both options were really good the sauce on the ravioli was smooth and buttery and the risotto was filled with bacon Italian cheeses, red peppers, and bleu cheese . Great choices ! We all decided to get to dessert, we could of skipped this portion of our dinner. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I gave Sausalido a try this past weekend in a last-minute effort to use my Groupon (which expired yesterday! How awesome am I at procrastinating?). I highly suggest making a reservation here if you plan on dining on the weekend, as it not only seriously packs in after 5PM, but often times they don't seat UNLESS you have a reservation.  Food here was quite good - our meal started with complimentary bread and white bean dip which was a pleasant surprise (in contrast to the usual stale-bread-and-olive-oil mix). My boyfriend and I shared the sage wheat encrusted gouda appetizer with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto, which was definitely the highlight of our experience. Really, really delicious. The exterior was a crispy breaded layer while the interior was a warm, buttery, melted gouda. To die for!  As vegetarians, both my boyfriend and I got the asparagus and manchego ravioli for our main course. Unfortunately, their menu didn't offer too many vegetarian (and no vegan) options, so beware if you're a fellow herbivore. The ravioli was served with a tasty red pepper reduction and sliced avocados, which lent it a smooth, rich taste. Being that the sauce was red pepper based, it could have benefited from a little more spice and salt, as red pepper sauces can tend to be a bit bland.  One major downside was that I felt somewhat rushed through my meal since there was a long line of people waiting to be seated (and my table was located next to the entrance). The environment is also a bit cramped for a more upscale restaurant in my opinion. Service was efficient, but a little cold, too. Overall, good food despite the anxious environment. Worth the experience, especially if you've got a Groupon!",

    "text": "I dined here for the first time about a month ago when I met a friend for an impromptu dinner date.  I'd been wanting to try the food here for quite a long time so when my friend asked where I wanted to eat that night, I suggested that we meet here.  We arrived around 6 PM on a Tuesday evening and the place was completely empty, which made me a little nervous, and overall our visit was mediocre at best.  We were seated near the window, which typically happens when a restaurant is empty - they try to give the appearance of having customers in the restaurant.  Our silverware was dirty and we had to ask for fresh, the waitress explained that the silverware had been set up on Saturday night just before they closed as the reason that the silverware had food particles on it (they are closed on Sundays and Mondays).  I ended up ordering East Coast Caesar with salmon and my friend had the Beets and Bleu salad.  The salads were fine, but really they were just that - \"fine\" and reminded of countless others that I've over the years at various restaurants around the US and granted, it's \"just a Caesar salad\" but I've had some spectacular ones and some really awful ones and this fell squarely in the passable but nothing remarkable category.  I do want to give them a second chance and perhaps try and entree the next time as maybe they were having an off night.  I will post an update if I go again, but as for now, my review stands at 3 stars.",

I wanted to try their signature capon and ditallini soup but they were out.    Their complimentary starter, white bean dip with bits of celery, red peppers, carrots and drizzled with balsamic vinegar is scrumptious.  The steak was the best i've had in a while although a bit too rare; the next time i go i'll bring along a bottle of red to enjoy with it, obviously i will definitely be going back.  I used to live within five minutes of a walk from Sausalido but had never tried the place out :(.  It's a gem in Pittsburgh and probably the best place to eat in Bloomfield.   I also had their turkey havarti sandwich with asparagus and basil mayo...it was pretty much a perfect sandwich definitely worth nine dollars.    It's a small cozy place with the cutest bathroom for women that I have ever been in.  The bathroom had a canvas of marilyn monroe and her quote \"I am not interested in money.  I just want to be wonderful,\" on the wall.",

Everything is to die for and at $12 for the lunch portion, is one of the best deals I've seen in a long time for a fancy lunch salad.  The salad itself is massive and is heaping with marinated beets & red onions, pecans and blue cheese. There is no skimping here!  I didn't even use any of the dressing because it wasn't needed. The salmon filet was the perfect size and cooked to perfection. I'd like to try this salad  again with the chicken.  I've eaten here before and can totally vouch for not only the portion sizes and their Havarti Turkey and Asparagus sandwich. It was so awesome and lovely but too huge for me to finish. I had a bit of my friend's Chicken Cutlet sandwich and it was equally heavenly (I'd share that one though - it's pretty rich and huge for one person).  Yes, the inside is a bit cramped for the amount of tables they have but I'll take a small, intimate and delicious local place over the cavernous drivel of a chain restaurant any day. Definitely check these guys out the next time you're in Bloomfield!",

The one time it wasn't, we just happened to be there one of those nights when the restaurant got slammed with business and they were running out of food and customers were starting to get annoyed.

The Beets & Bleu Salad - was great.  And I think this was the meal that turned me into a beet lover.   For entrees we had the Goat Cheese stuffed chicken and London Broil.  Both were very very good.  The owner/manager is great and usually stops by every table.  Services is excellent.  It's a small place, and both times I've been there it hasn't been packed.  We're typically a loud group - so I imagine had it been full - everyone would have been subject to our ridiculous stories.  The wine I guzzled at dinner was also excellent - but it's byob - so now I'm just reviewing myself.",

    "text": "Note: I've only been a patron for lunch; I'll update my review after I visit for dinner.  We ended up heading over to Sausalido for lunch since it's always been on my list of restaurants to try and I was in the mood to enjoy a full meal instead of the quick drop-in for takeout or a sandwich.  Upon arriving, we noticed we were the only patrons of the restaurant at the time (around 12:45 PM).  Yes it was a bit unexpected, but it meant we got the full attention of the waitress and we could be seated anywhere we liked.  While we looked over the menu, she brought out a bread plate with a white bean dip drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and topped with red peppers.  The dip was delicious and we had no problem finishing everything.  Later she brought out three freshly made bowls of seafood chowder, compliments of the chef.  She noted with a laugh, \"one the perks of being the only customers right now.\"  The seafood chowder was chock-full of fish, scallops, mussels, and shrimp.  The base of the soup itself was flavorful and light, not like traditional chowders bogged down with heavy cream.  My two companions decided to start out with two more cups of the seafood chowder while I opted for their Capon and Ditalini soup, a chicken noodle soup offered every day.  My soup is freshly prepared with their house chicken stock with wilted spinach and topped with cheese.  I preferred the seafood chowder, but I have to note that the chicken stock had multiple layers and many subtle flavors.  For our entrees I ordered their gnocci, and my companions ordered their crab cakes and their flank steak.  My gnocci is advertised as \"house made\", but realistically it was brought in from elsewhere.  It was served with braised lamb in a tomato ragout and topped fish fresh basil and freshly grated cheese.  The flavors were all there, but I like my gnocci with a bit more of a bite to it.  The braised lamb was a bit tough and ended up detracting from the dish as opposed to improving it.  The crab cakes were pretty good, but would've been slightly more epic if the lump meat was a bit larger.  It's a pretty small portion, so do make sure you order a soup to go along with it.  The flank steak was served medium rare topped with a horseradish creme fraiche with smashed potatoes.  The steak was excellent; cooked well and flavorful from being marinated and seasoned properly.  The smashed potatoes were a bit too cheesy for my liking, but I like how smashed potatoes have lots of textures going on with mild lumps of potato and potato skin in the mix.  Sausalido is BYOB, so you can bring your own bottle and you definitely should ($2 corkage fee per person).  Lots of entrees from the lunch menu have encore presentations on the dinner menu; however, there are new dishes as well such as a duck breast, scallops, and a pork chop.  There aren't too many seats in the restaurant, so for dinner I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations just to be on the safe side.",

    "text": "Sausilido (a mix between Sausalito the place and Lido, the owners grandfather) is a new bistro in Bloomfield. They opened up in October of '08 and are already basically reservation only during peak weekend dinner times.   The customer service is wonderful, as is the quality of food and the presentation. We had the smoked Gouda for an appetizer. I'm not the biggest fan of smoked Gouda, but it was good, and prepared well. But the app was served with a delicious, perfectly prepared sauteed spinach salad. Needless to say, Sausalido takes care of the details. And they offer fresh ground pepper for your salad, and fresh ground Parmesan for your pasta, which is something I've never encountered in Pgh, not even at Eleven. My friend got a special, it was steak with potatoes and vegetables (it was more fancy then that, of course). He was very pleased with his food. I had the bechamel lasagna and it was great, but REALLY rich.  The place is BYOB with a small per person (not per bottle) cork fee. I think it's $2. It's by far one of the better dining experiences that I've had in Pittsburgh, and it's well above most of the other restaurants in Bloomfield.",

    "text": "This gem is pretty close to work so i was able to check it out for lunch with a couple of my work mates. There were 6 people in my party and they were able to seat us immediately ...it was also 1230pm.   The place is small and intimate. Cute decor and very homey.  They have a simple no fuss italian menu.  Appetizers, sandwiches and bigger meals. Its BYOB. They had one vegetarian salad, one vegetarian wrap and entree. Our waiter was a bit dull and even maybe hangover?? very blah demeanor.  He also wasn't familiar with some of the items on the menu. i.e the salad of the day. However this was quickly redeemed by their white bean/olive oil vinaigrette dip that comes with the basket of bread. OMG delish i probably ate too much. It had the perfect kick and a great way to get the tummy ready for the entree.  I ordered the  lemon goat cheese ravioli with asparagus and it was delicious. A bit more cheesier than i expected but still extremely flavourful the asparagus was probably my favourite item on the plate. Fresh and not too raw or over cooked. The serving was big and i got to have some leftovers for dinner. One of  My meat eating friends got the chicken sandwich that shes still talking about. My glass of water was refilled frequently and so was my friends' ice teas. We also got our checks pretty quickly.  A+ for the fast service.  Other than the lack of enthusiasm for life from our waiter, I thought this place was great. The lunch prices are also very reasonable. $11 for my ravioli and about 9/10 for sandwiches. At the end of the meal the chef came out to see how we liked our meals and he was cute and friendly thus adding one more star to this review. If you work in Bloomfield or shadyside this is a great place to check out for lunch. We were there for about 45 minutes and with the fast service you will be able to enjoy an amazing meal without getting on the boss's shit list.",

    "text": "I visited Sausalido last night, something I'd been meaning to do ever since I noticed it several months ago.  It was late on a Wednesday and the place was nearly empty, so we were promptly seated and delivered a plate of bread and a very tasty white bean dip with olive oil and balsamic.  As I enjoyed the appetizer, I took in my surroundings.  It's a small, cozy space, with a sort of modern, minimalist decor - tastefully done, in my opinion.    The menu presented a challenge, as there were many items that sounded promising.  We settled on scallops with wilted spinach and pancetta ($26) and gnocchi in tomato-basil ragout with braised lamb ($19).  The scallops were large, properly cooked and slathered with a very flavorful tomato-butter sauce.  The accompanying spinach, however, was a bit too salty even for this salt lover.  The gnocchi had good texture and flavor; unfortunately, it was done a disservice by the tomato-basil ragout, which tasted little of fresh tomatoes or basil.  The lamb was also a disappointment, as it was somewhat bland and rather tough and chewy.  As we finished our meal, the owner/chef came out to ask us how it was, which I always appreciate.  I tried to give him some constructive criticism because I really want this place to succeed. I love the  concept: a neighborhood bistro with an eclectic menu based on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  At least on this night, however, the execution was wanting.  Don't get me wrong; I did enjoy my meal, but at this price range I expect more consistency and attention to detail.  I'll gladly return in a few months, eager to see if Sausalido has made progress in living up to its lofty potential.",

    "text": "Sausalido attempts to be a quaint Mediterranean bistro.   I believe the intimate atmosphere accommodates that very well, and the service is admirable. It is a good place to take a date, which I did (pimpin aint easy, I know). From there, the maitre d is accommodating with the corkage and you can let all your conversational juices flow over a nice glass of red wine.   The staff likes to give appetizers on the house, which are generally delicious. I found several other appetizers to be well prepared, but very basic. I believe one was akin to a cheesy baked potato with bacon. Those are always tasty, but  I could make that when I was a culinary challenged college student.  My main course was a simple seafood and veggie pasta a la oligio. It seemed a bit bland, and would have probably been better with fresh cracked black pepper, some truffle salt, and shredded Gruyere. When a restaurant is trying to convey an attitude of beauty through simplicity, the utmost attention must be given to a dish to justify its price point. Yes, pasta is simple, but there needs to be a delicate balance of high quality flavors to make the simple into elegant.  I still enjoyed the experience, but feel Sausalido is encountering the troubles that I see of other up and coming Pgh restaurants. They are trying to be something through their image, but not accounting for the details which bring it to life. You can get away with that in Pgh, but it wouldn't fly in a larger city.",

    "text": "Sausalido used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I had only been there a few months ago and was very happy with my meal and the service.  My last visit was a different story. The service was HORRENDOUS, probably the worst I've ever experienced, and the food seems to have gone downhill too. When we arrived our server (an older man with glasses) somehow brought us 4 waters for 2 people, this was not a big deal, but the table space was limited so we didn't need the extra glasses. He then brought us our bread and bean dip before taking our order. We waited almost 40 MINUTES before we were even asked for our order. The waiter did not apologize, we were unsure if he even realized his mistake. He then brought us more bread and bean dip, I think not realizing that he had already brought us some, but that was a good thing since we had already been waiting 40 minutes to order. I remember from previous visits the salad that comes with the meal was very good, it had beets in it and I believe there was always a special house-made dressing, last time I was there it was a raspberry dressing. The waiter only gave us the option of Italian dressing this time, which was house-made, but I was disappointed because I'm not a huge Italian dressing fan. We later heard another waiter giving another table more options, so I guess that they had them, we just were not made aware of them. My boyfriend also requested no salad, but the waiter brought him one anyways. When my salad arrived, I also discovered it had changed, it was a regular house salad with tomatoes, not the one with beets that I remembered.  Unfortunately our main courses were not as good as our previous visits either. My boyfriend ordered the steak, and I ordered the daily fish, which was tilapia. The portion sizes were big, I received 2 pieces of fish, however the dish lacked flavor. This was surprising considering the description said the fish had a \"grilled pineapple curry butter.\" My fish tasted basically like buttered fish, with minimal butter, and the black bean mixture that came with it also lacked flavor. I tasted no curry flavoring, and there were 3 tiny canned pineapple sized chunks on my 2 pieces of fish. I probably could have made this dish at home, maybe even made it more flavorful. My boyfriend also said his steak was not a good cut of meat. When we were done with our meals the server also took forever to get us our box, even when there were only 6 tables left in the restaurant. Other customers seemed annoyed as well, their waters, etc were not being filled.  I hate to give this place a bad review, but I had the worst service I have ever experienced, and the food was disappointing too. It's a shame, but I will probably not be back.",

My husband ordered a different fish, which was heavily battered, though not described as such by the waiter.   On the bright side, my meal was relatively healthy and Sausalido does permit corking.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area and just have a nice meal. We particularly enjoyed the smoked Gouda appetizer and the egg plant Parmesan dinner. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the service. Being a small European restaurant, I wasn't expecting all smiles and attentiveness, but our waitress was particularly rude. She tossed bread at us when we asked for more, hurried us out when we were just sitting around chatting, and seemed very annoyed. Maybe she was having a bad night? I won't let that detract from the overall experience and delicious food, though. Highly recommend!",

However on my last visit, right at closing time the server turned off the music and the lights on full blast. It was very awkward as there was also another table which was large party in the room. They had just cleared our plates too. I have been in the restaurant industry so I know what its like when tables just chill and its closing time but that was not the way to go about it and it was 10 mins past 9:15.

Entrees are in the $20-$26 range an include a salad and a wonderful white bean/balsamic/rosemary dip with bread cubes. Actually, I think all of us would have been content to forgo entrees and have a glass of wine and enjoy the bread and white bean dip, which appears to include unlimited refills.  That said, the entrees are varied including trout, duck, porkchop, risotto, crab cakes. Many dishes included brussell sprouts, which two at our table aren't enamored with and were easily substituted for other accompaniments.  The person at our table with the gluten allergy found the waiter able to offer many choices to meet her needs. Definitely food-allergy friendly.  Service is fine. A bit noisy until the owner turned down the Lionel Richie music upon request.  Portion sizes were reasonable and everyone enjoyed their meals.  Not five stars, but a solid four star entry in Bloomfield.  As an aside, we miss D'Amico's.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is fairly casual, although I don't think I would wear jeans there.    Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken.  They gave us a few minutes before taking our order and we ordered the Smoked Brie, hubby had the Ravioli and I had the Risotto of the day.  They brought us a plate with fresh bread and a delicious white bean/oil/rosemary dip -- so good!    The appetizer arrived quickly and we went to work on the brie.  It was mild and creamy and delicious.  I would recommend asking for a little bit of balsamic reduction -- it added so much to the cheese!  I didn't try the ravioli but my husband INHALED them.  He loved it!  The risotto was amazing, probably the best I've had that I didn't make myself.  The day we went it was made with peas and crimini mushrooms.  Yum!  We were stuffed after dinner but wanted to try the dessert so we got the bread pudding to go.  All I can say is more please!   Another plus to this place is that it is BYOB, so you can bring whatever you like.",

    "text": "Sausalido. Hmm... I feel torn about you!   If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would have. The service is good, and the owner (I believe his name is Nick) flits about the restaurant, helping to seat people, serve food, and just generally chat with customers and see how their meals are going. I love that! But, of course, this is a restaurant, so on to the food...  I've had dishes here that are great, and I've had dishes that leave me thinking I should have just stayed home and cooked.   The good? Well, the bread they give you at the beginning with their homemade dipping sauce is awesome. I just had to pause while writing this, because I wasn't sure what to call the 'sauce'. It's actually an interesting concoction that consists of a homemade hummus that tastes like a combo of chickpeas and peppers, and it's drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and some chopped tomatoes. Regardless, it's delicious, and the bread is always soft and fresh. Also noteworthy: the mussels in coconut curry sauce. You will be asking for more bread to sop up that sauce! The mussels are perfectly tender, and the sauce is plentiful and oh-so-flavorful. The onion rings, as mentioned in other reviews, are pretty great too.   The \"eh\"? I haven't had a main dish here that has resulted in another tally on my Clean Plate Club card. I was here for NYE when they had a limited menu (like many restaurants) and I had the steak. It was okay. Nothing to write home about. Last time I was here, I had the porkchop and my boyfriend had the fish. My porkchop did have a nice herbed butter on top that definitely was the star of the dish. Despite the fact that the porkchop was perfectly cooked, if that herbed butter hadn't been spread all over its surface, it would have been Bland City. The chop was on a bed of sweet potato hash, but I really didn't find it to be too complementary to the pork and butter.   My boyfriend's fish was on a bed of quinoa that he thought was decent, but he, like myself, wound up leaving quite a bit on his plate, despite being super hungry upon arrival. Oh, and he went with the wedding soup (they call it something fancier-sounding on the menu) instead of a salad, but it was pretty bland, and there was a lot of fresh spinach leaves in it that hadn't really cooked down as much as they should have, which was kinda... weird.   All in all, I'd go back (especially because I live like 2 minutes away), but I'll just stick with sharing a few apps instead of ordering main dishes next time!",

Apparently, their risotto comes highly recommended and they have different types of risotto every day (I think).

    "text": "I've been to Sausalido several times over the past few years but have never written a review. We decided to go for restaurant week. The menu on the restaurant week website looked good. Two appetizer choices, a salad, and two entree choices for $25.14 including a corkage fee (BYOB). Hubs went with the restaurant week menu. In the mood for pasta, I went with the bolognese. The server brought over bread with their white bean/balsamic spread. Very yummy, as always.  We started with the quinoa meat(less)balls which was easily the star of the show. Anytime a healthy ingredient like quinoa is transformed into something so delicious that I can't even tell it's healthy, that's a homerun in the food world. Quinoa, cheese and marinara sauce, who would have thought? The next course was a salad with their white balsamic dressing. A standard salad topped off with blackberries, a nice surprise.   My bolognese arrived soon after the salad was cleared. Unfortunately, this is where the meal went downhill. The pasta was tender but the sauce lacked flavor for me. Although meaty, I was hoping for a more of a tomato base. I ended up taking most of it home for hubs who really enjoyed his risotto with bacon, arugula and blue cheese.   The service was also lacking. At the beginning of the meal we spent a significant amount of time looking around and waiting to order. When asking questions about the menu we were given either  a short answer or said he didn't know because he never tried it. Overall, some parts of our experience were fantastic while others were lacking.",

My friend had the pasta bolognaise (sp) which was also really great- hearty and filling. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting... the owner and staff are all really nice. They ran out of a couple things we wanted to try, but I'll be back to rectify that.",

    "text": "There seems to be many negative reviews here, but it was not our experience.  We had a very nice meal there.  The service was good, the food was good, portions were generous, presentation better than expected and prices were good.  The restaurant is small and there isn't much decor-wise (you're kinda right on the street).  Additionally the BYOB is nice.  You can enjoy a nice bottle of wine and not have to pay a triple price.  There are a few minor negatives.  1) city parking, 2) tables are a little close (even for a small place) and 3) wait staff needs a little more training.  We  will definitely return.",
