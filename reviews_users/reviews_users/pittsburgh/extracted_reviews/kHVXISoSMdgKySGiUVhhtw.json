They proceeded to tell her the wait was 2 hours which wasn't a problem because she got there pretty early in the evening. Finally, when she was notified a bay was ready for her and her date, they told her that her and her date couldn't use it because they were under 18. It was 9:00 and all because she was under 18 she and her date couldn't play. Talk about a waste of time. The staff wasn't even decent enough to notify her when she got there. Instead, they made her wait and wasted her and her dates time. WILL NOT GO BACK.",

The food is really good but the wait times for the golf bays are a bit daunting -- make sure to plan ahead. It's great if you have time to kill because there are pool tables and shuffleboard games and TVs and plenty of booths in the restaurant... But if you're in a hurry then you might want to consider making a reservation which will cost you a little more. It's supposed to be a drop in place but if there is a crowd then waiting is a bit frustrating. Once you get to your bay the golf game is great fun!",

We were quoted a 60-75 minute wait for a bay, which would've been fine and to be expected, but it ended up being 115 minutes. Moreover, the text alert to say our bay was ready said \"You have 5 minutes\" to report to the bay, after they just made us wait an extra 40-55? Come on.  While waiting, we went to the restaurant and found a table pretty easily. After ordering, the food took about an hour to get served, and when it was, it was all cold.  The gameplay portion was all fine. Since it was the day after Christmas at peak rush, I can understand the long waits. The overall dinner service however, was pretty bad.  I would consider giving this place another shot strictly for the gameplay. I wouldn't recommend going on an empty stomach, though.",

However this time, a few friends and I took a two hour drive to get there and we get there and the lady for the first time ever asks us if we're 18 or older, which I am 17 abt to be 18 in a month, tells us we can't play becuz they serve alcohol but also becuz of \"our age being reckless and destroying stuff\". She's acting like a 1 month difference in time is gonna change my behavior, we never had an issue in the past and even told her we literally drove 2 hrs to get there and then she became rude about it and started yelling at us. Absolutely pissed off because the rules make no sense, like take my money, If im \"reckless\" then kick us out, you still got our money, and we had been there 10 times in the past. This may be one of the last times I go because of how pissed off I am. Hopefully there can be some reform to the rule",

    "text": "It's like Dave and Busters for golf. Here is my review from a golfer's perspective:   If you just want to seriously work on your game, or practice driving more than 185 yards, this place isn't for you. First, it's more expensive than a regular driving range. You rent a bay by the hour. I went before noon when it's $25/hour (It's $35 after noon and $45 after 5:00) You can also eat in your bay, so you can't bring your own beverages. Taking the time to eat comes out of your paid hour, so I definitely don't see myself eating. There is a separate restaurant and bar, however. There are also waitresses. They do wait until you're finished swinging to actually talk to you, but I found their presence waiting for that moment distracting. You can hit unlimited balls and you select from a variety of games. The game they suggested I start with gave you points depending on the target you hit. That was lame because club selection wasn't taken into consideration. You got more points for hitting farther targets, but it didn't consider that maybe you were only practicing chipping. I eventually found the specific games for chipping and driving. You make your selections from a monitor that provides you with the results of each ball. You have to hit an actual target though or you get no points or info. I have a major complaint about the tees. They are too short for your driver. I brought this up and was told that was intentional for safety, but I feel it had a negative impact on my driving. The maximum yardage is only 185, so don't go there to practice driving if you can drive farther. I paid $18.75 for 45 minutes where I hit 89 balls. A basket of 102 balls at Cool Springs is $15. I wouldn't want to share a bay with anyone because I'd hit even fewer balls. I definitely don't want to come with a group of people unless they pay for their own bay. I wouldn't even want to share a bay with one other person. I don't think this place is worth the money after 12 noon. I did have fun however. The facility is very nice and the staff is friendly and helpful. If just want to socialize with your friends while playing a game, it would be cool. I probably won't go back outside of the am.  The menu is fine for most, but just a couple vegetarian options and very few vegan options.",

EVERYONE is very nice but it seemed very unorganized,They text me when our pod was ready we gathered up everything then got a  text said to wait they weren't ready. Then waited 10 minutes and heard nothing. I went to the desk and was given a different pod. When golfing is done you have 15 minutes to get out of the pod. Not enough time for 8 people to split a tab that was over 100.00 dollars. HAD A GREAT TIME!!",

We had to ask another server to get our check because our server was not around. The bill was incorrect. It took additional time to it corrected. Frustrating experience. The Golf experience was great. We had fun. The Assistant at our Bay was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend by-passing the lounge and wait until you get to the Bay to order any food.

I tried making a reservation online but it said it was all full but most of their bays are on a first-come basis. We excitedly made the 30+ minute drive to celebrate hubby's birthday. At the front entrance a security guard stopped us and said we couldn't bring in unopened bottles of water (our kids were holding them). So we threw them away. We registered and they said it would be a 45-60 min wait.... no problem.... we hung out with our kids. They asked what level we wanted to play and i asked if the top level was available. They said yes. Well......After 1.5 hours of waiting......I went and asked the front desk what's up?!? And they said at least another 20 minutes and the top level is not available. I spoke w the manager and expressed very cordially that I'm a business owner and feedback is a gift. Don't set an expectation and then not fulfill it and keep stalling. So we ended up leaving. I've heard great things about TopGolf in other places. If you go, just plan a really long time before you can hit some balls. Here's a screenshot of our text... ......PS -- we just received a phone call at 5:39pm that our bay is ready!!! Checked in at 2:08pm (told 45 min wait) ready at 5:39pm.... crazy!!!  Also interesting all the low star reviews (and there were 18) are not being verified/published to factor in the company rating.",

    "text": "Fun to try it out.   Three stories of hitting bays, bars, pool tables, foosball.  They have several games you can play with your group.  Everyone that wants to play and track your score needs to sign up for a life time membership and get a card to slide in to play ($5 for a lifetime membership).  We started with 60 minutes but were able to extend the time.  Pricing changes depending on the hour.   9am to 12 pm - $25 per hour 12 pm to 5 pm - $35 per hour 5 pme to close -$45 per hour After one hour, we added a half hour so our group could finish and play a different match they have set up in the system (based on accuracy and distance you get more points).  The balls have a microchip and do not fly as well as your typical golf ball so you have to adjust the distance and even the fade or draw because the ball fight is different than a normal golf ball.   You can come to drink and hang out and watch at one of the bars or seating areas.   We ordered some food to eat. Started with the Queso and Chips.  The Queso was very good and they did provide some additional chips at no cost.  Split a few other items including Prosciutto, Artichoke & Olive flatbread and Sunrise Burger that was cooked perfectly.  Our food was good; better than expected since still in the soft opening.  They have food runners who brought the food out in a reasonable time and were in a hurry to clear our table even though we still had fries and tots and pickles on our plates.  When were were done with our hitting (time was up) but not quite done with our food our waitress seemed to be in a hurry to get us to leave.  Good luck to others.   The hitting bays we used and around us all had six high top chairs and a table.  There is a large TV to watch your scoring and your can watch TV on the top.  Music playing in the background.   Each bay from what I can see, comes with 6 clubs in three different types kids, ladies and mens due to length of the clubs.  You can bring your own.  If you have a golf glove, bring it and wear athletic shoes not the high heels I saw on one person.    The target areas light up and the colors rotated.  This was a fun experience and fun to watch but not sure I would be a prime time player at Topgolf. Maybe more of a once in awhile for entertainment and/or to have a drink and watch others.",

The wait time for her to actually wait on us, after she noticed we needed waited on was very long. When she did get to us, she was not friendly or pleasant. Then a new bar tender stepped in, Zach, and he also waited on every new comer to the bar, but us, and specifically catering to men. We eventually went back to our bay in hopes for better service there, but we waited up to 30 minutes for the server to return with our drinks, and by then, we were leaving. This could be a fun environment if the service was stepped up a bit!",

    "text": "My daughter and her boyfriend are in town visiting and suggested coming here today. It was a great idea, we had a great time. There were 4 of us and we ended spending right around $125 which included 2 memberships, golf for 1.5 hours, food and drinks. Matty was at our bay ready to help us for the afternoon and he was a hoot. He definitely seemed to enjoy his job, was always around when we needed him and made time for small talk with us when he came around. I was actually kind of surprised at how organized and well run the whole thing seem to be since they haven't been opened but a week. All of the food that we ordered was also very good. I didn't think the prices seemed extravagant and they were running a few seasonal, limited time specials. I went with a grilled peach salad and it was fabulous, maybe a little heavy handed on the balsamic dressing but overall a great, fresh, summer salad. We also ordered the warm pretzel bites which came with a beer cheese sauce and a horseradish mustard sauce, and also the HUGE jumbo pretzel board. The pretzel was loaded with grapes, blackberries, apples, 2 cheeses, salami, prosciutto, sausage and candied pecans. For $21 it was a great alternative to your typical charcuterie board and we loved it. My husband went with the grilled chicken sandwich and fries... basic, but cooked and seasoned well. Overall we had a great afternoon and will definitely be coming back to Top Golf. It's a fun way to spend some time with all ages, friends or family. They also offer a 10% Heroes / Military discount.",

    "text": "We celebrated my sister's birthday on Saturday night of opening weekend. We arrived at 7:30 and were quoted a 2 1/2 hour wait. We were unable to make reservations on opening weekend, which makes sense. I would HIGHLY recommend making online reservations before coming here on a weekend. We ended up only waiting for 1 1/2 hours, and we found a comfy sectional on the 3rd floor rooftop bar area with a fire pit and cornhole area next to the DJ. We ordered apps and drinks. The staff was nice but unexperienced. It's was super busy and chaotic, and some of our orders got lost or were delayed an hour or so. We closed our tabs when they texted us our bay number, but some of our orders were still pending and didn't end up transferring to the 2nd level where our bay was. They made it right by comping our lost or delayed meals. We ended up receiving a ton of food we didn't order because of mix-ups, but we were never charged for them. Obviously, they are still working out the kinks, but this place is awesome. The apps and drinks were surprisingly good, but the highlight is the awesome driving range experience. It's like no other. I'm not a huge golfer, and I still had so much fun. There are different targets you can aim at and 10 different games you can play. Each ball has a computer chip that tells you where it lands on a flat screen at your bay. It's a super fun night whether you're an avid golfer or not.",

    "text": "Updated review: We finally got our golf on last nite. The bay experience, golfing, having an area to yourself with music, TV and a server was very nice. Our server was tremendous...very efficient and tentative. The grilled wings were delicious! Definitely a must try menu item. We had a good time. It's a pricey place after golfing, eating and drinking, but worth a visit. The restaurant inside still needs some work with the servers and their attentiveness, but we had a fun date nite!  ------------------------------- We were excited to check out the newest craze in Pittsburgh. After both my BF and I read up on the website about Top Golf, we figured a rainy week night was a good time to go. We did not make an online reservation since the website says \"walk ins are welcome.\" We proceeded to get there about 8pm on a Wednesday night. The wait to golf was 3 hours; that just seemed ridiculous. I thought they had a large number of bays to accommodate people. We decided to stay and check out the bar/restaurant since we were already there. It's a seat yourself restaurant which was fine. However, it took us having to grab a waitress' attention (there were many of them around and not a lot of tables full in the restaurant mind you) to finally get one to come over. She was nice but was uneducated about the menu, how to work their handheld computers and distracted us from ordering and adding onto our orders. Our drinks took an incredibly long time and again, it wasn't crowded. The food was good, but nothing spectacular and the portions are incredibly tiny and pricey. The side salad was literally 4 bites and an up-charge. Wow. We decided to give it another try next week and made an online reservation to actually golf. I'll update my review to see if the experience improves with the wait staff and golfing.",

My husband and I ordered drinks from our waitress. They came fairly quickly, but from a different waiter. He asked if we wanted to order food, and we ordered an appetizer, as we are waiting on friends. Our original waitress came back, and asked if we wanted to order food. We said that we had ordered from the person who brought our drinks. Then, a third person shows up, with 2 appetizers that we had not ordered. We sent him away. A fourth person, finally, showed up, with our correct order. No napkins. No dishes. No silverware. I went to the bar, and asked for napkins. I was told by 3 separate people that they didn't have any at the bar. They asked the name of our waiter/waitress, and I had to respond, I really have no idea. When we were almost done with our appetizer, we finally received napkins. We are still sitting here, our friends have arrived. After having 4 separate waitresses/waiters, they are all now absent. No drinks. No food. No service. I came here when they initially opened, and had horrible service. Tried again for a work function, which was not bad. Here I am again, sitting in the restaurant/bar area, waiting. And waiting..........And waiting.... How does a place, that can draw in such a crowd, have such horrible service?!?!!!  This is my last time Top Golf. Why can you you not get it together? I'm certain there is a corporate office/management. I would hope someone steps in, before this place goes under.",

You can use this at all locations. The staff was very quick and attentive. We paid $45 for an hour, for a group of three we were able to get two games in plus a few extra hits. Good atmosphere.

The golf game is fun, but for a non-golfer like me, it's a bit too expensive to come regularly.  We came this past Friday specifically to play Cornhole, and because they were setting up for a DJ that night, the cornhole was taken away.  We played Shuffleboard and Foosball instead, and it was still fun, but we really wanted to play Cornhole . . . LOL!!! Afterwards we had dessert, and ordered the ice cream sundae.  It wasn't that good.  It was really soft and melty, and the consistency seemed like soft serve that had been in the heat a little bit too long.  I guess we were expecting it to be colder, and it also had very little chocolate sauce, so it could've been better.   Today I opened the place at 9:00am and golfed, and when I was checking in, there were several computer glitches (Kept trying to put me on the third floor several times, when I asked for 2nd level), and it took me about 10 minutes to get set up, whereas a person next to me (I heard him say it was his first time there), checked in and left in just under a minute or two (and they also forgot to give me a veteran discount, which I did get last time I golfed)). Afterwards had the Fried Chicken Sandwich along with a hard cider for lunch (Both were delicious), and the service at the bar was great.     Overall, I still think this place is A-OK, but I am not as enamored with it as I was a week ago.   Cheers!",

What bothered me most is that our host kept saying that since it was cold outside, that's why our scores weren't registered correctly and why it was taking so long to change games and such. You pay an absorbent amount of money (weekend night) and wait so long (two hours) just to get a 4/10 experience. Our host didn't come around more than twice in a matter of two hours and my friends had to find the host just to order. What kills me is that the hosts aren't even the ones bringing out the food and drinks so what makes them so busy in a matter of the two hours we were there? Also the fact that you have to manually turn the heat in the bay back on after an hour (if you have 2 hours or more) is kind of annoying to be completely honest. I mean, I'm not saying I won't go again, I just expected more for the price you pay there.",

    "text": "Super cool spot to hang out at for summer fun. They are definitely still working out the staffing kinks. We arrived at 8:40 on a Sunday and didn't get a spot to swing at until 10. Looked around and bunch of lanes were open, but from the looks of it we had to wait a long time simply because they did not have enough waitstaff or kitchen capacity to cover all the lanes being in use and potentially ordering food/drink.   There's a few fun things to do other than swinging a golf club here. They have games and activities set up across the floors like large scale beer pong, jenga and corn-hole as well as pool and Foosball tables. There are also a few fire pits to sit by. The music is loud throughout the space and its club music, so I hope you like Justin Bieber (I do haha) be warned they played about 5 JBiebs mixes within the same hour.   The menu looked intriguing but I did not order anything. The upper floor bar area needed a good cleaning there was ketchup and food all over the seating areas.   The functionality of playing is really well designed. The balls comes out automatically through an easy swipe of the club over a sensor. The balls have GPS technology within the ball that tracks your golf ball and accurately scores each shot based on the target it enters. The score tracker screen is neat as well allowing you to see how you're doing ans how much time is left. I wish they had some sort of quick video to watch on the screens for beginners. I don't know how to properly swing so I was expecting a quick video or written overview on the proper stance and swing - I'm certainly not interested in paying for the 1:1 coaching, just looking to not hurt or embarass myself with terrible form.   The pricing is by the bay per hour, not per person. The bays hold up to 6 players at once. BUT then there is this sneaky membership fee for ANY player that you want the tech system to take score for. That's not explained well by the people there. It was frustrating to not get a clear answer from the bay set up guy why I had to register (with phone and email), why I couldn't just play as I was already paying for the bay time. The website explains it well, but the guy there was flustered by my question.  Overall a fun activity just expect to wait.",

The location seemed severely understaffed. So much so the wait was 2 hours even though there were large amount of bays open (the first ten on the first floor were closed). The bathrooms were very dirty, service was slow and not good, and the game seemed to be having issues as well.   Service: the gal was rude and acted like putting in an order or splitting up a tab was too much trouble for her and acted annoyed. She kept taking plates away that we were still eating. Finally we got the water we asked for and 5 mins later she bussed all the full glasses off table  Game: seemed like the ball collector cart was not working. There were so many balls that our shots were constantly hitting other balls before making it to the hole. The cart would go out and just park for long periods in the middle (blocking targets). Also a lot of shots didn't score or would score much later. You watch a ball hit the back wall and it wouldn't score, then the next person would be up and 5 mins later your ball would score. Kinda takes the air out of competition and fun.   All that being said we still has fun, this place just needs to tighten it up.",

Neither of us had eaten yet that day and there was a 45 min wait to golf. It was close to 10 pm. We sat down at a table in the restaurant and after waiting about ten mins, a server named Kim came to our table. This young girl is not only one of the worst servers I've ever encountered, she had one of the nastiest attitudes I've ever seen. Rude, lazy, confrontational, NASTY! Between her and probably the most underwhelming, tasteless, overpriced, bad tasting food I've ever eaten, we left with out even golfing. I wasn't about to give an establishment that employs such a nasty human being another dime of my hard earned money.",

The facility is very clean and most of the employees were very friendly. We got there around noon and there was a hour and a half wait, we decided to check the clubs (you can bring your own clubs) and go to the restaurant.   The menu has bar food such as wings, burgers, flatbreads, sandwiches etc. We didn't have a waitress come up to our table for awhile, although it seemed like all other tables were tended to in a timely fashion so I think it was just our waitress.  When we placed our order, which was about 30 mins after we sat down, we got the text that our bay was ready. The waitress brought us the bill and we could transfer the food to our bay.   The bays either have couches or tables. There are many different types of games you can play so it's not just the same thing over and over again. We saw people on dates, golfing groups, bachelor parties, kids birthday parties, etc.",

I know that's not True and finally they changed the sound to the game.  We asked for our tab to close out and they never came to close it out again we had to walk to the bar. What kind of service is this? HORRIBLE. 2 so called servers for 9 people in their entire bar area. They suck.  This place needs serious help in the customer service department.

The parking lot is big and the facility is nice and the staff at the front desk are great. But the pricing can change quick we where lucky to come for a happy hour they have for unlimited golf till noon for around $25 bucks. Now they do offer a foosball table free of charge but no balls to be found in sight. Also a pool table that's free of charge for first come first serve so that's nice to pass time. Once in the bay on are lane the service want down hill. I know a lot of the staff is new here and still training but she seem to take no interest in wanting to work at all. We ended up figuring things out are selfs and had to stop other servers just to get drinks and help cause she wasn't to be found. I ate before coming here but the food here seems interesting and could be a hit or miss. There's no super healthy options or any vegan options and sometimes that's stuff I wanna enjoy. I'm not a big golfer by any means but I do enjoy the driving range. After about a hour here I must admit I got pretty beat and not wanting to go on much more. I can see coming here at night being more fun but the price of a bay changes through out the day and goes up pretty high for a group at night. Now I would be open to coming here again but it's just like every other top golf I've been to and I wouldn't drive out of my way just to make a trip here with so many other driving ranges surrounding me.",

After about an hour and a half, it was only $10 per person. They have a full bar and food too. I will say I think the food is overpriced but everything else is great. They have a huge parking lot as well. You have the option to make reservations for a bay but depending on the day, it could cost $50 to reserve one. If you don't want to reserve one, I recommend coming early so you can wait beforehand. They have a kitchen and bar inside with seating so you can wait. We went when it was 17 outside, but there are heaters and you can't even tell it's that cold! We were sitting on the couches, not the tables and the heat from above made the seats so warm that we didn't want to get up! This place is so fun, even if you are not good at golf like us. A great way to spend time with friends on any type of day!",

So first of the place is very cool and clean looking. It's modern and super cool looking I have to be honest to say I didn't rent any of the golf spots, just went to the bar. The bar was cool and had lots of option so I ordered a draft and grabbed a menu. The drafts were reasonable and lots of choices  So the menu looked good, so I thought I would try the flatbread I ordered it at 7:15 It arrived at 7:15 and 30 seconds.... I was immediately hating it. It was awful, it tasted exactly what I expected a 30 second pizza would taste like I've had better pizza at 7/11, and I wish I was exaggerating but I'm not I ate one piece and asked for a box The bartender was cool and asked if I wanted anything else, but after that I cashed out and left I might try again but not right away  Update:  So the latest yelp trick is for the company to post a response right away to show they are trying to be reactive, then never really follow up I sent an email to the company over a month ago and never heard back. So needless to say, I won't come back.",

Some of the bays have high-top tables and others have outdoor lounge seating. All have three overhead heaters that you can control. The middle heater is on a timer and goes off every hour.   I didn't think I would be able to golf but I did pretty well. In fact, I beat everyone (not to brag or anything lol). Our server was excellent; she helped us with the golfing aspect of things as well as food. My Sunrise Burger was pretty good. Not the best burger I ever had, but good enough. I also got the Apple Pear Mocktail which was delicious.   Our golfing got messed up the second time around. It was having a hard time registering who was golfing despite us tapping our names on the screen.

The group I was with ordered a buffet that had amazing options like roasted chicken, prime rib, mashed potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts, a cheese plate, cookies, etc. There was also a full bar with a bunch of options: full wine list, a bunch of beers on tap, and mixed drinks.  The game was a BLAST! I do not golf, but I can swing a club (kind of) and that's all you have to do. This is a great way to hang with your golfer friends but not lose your mind because golf is unbelievably frustrating... The best way to describe Topgolf is like bowling, skeeball, and golf are all rolled up into one.  The only reason I'm not saying 5-stars is because I have no clue what the price point is since I wasn't paying. It was very fun, but depending on the price, it may or may not be worth it just for a casual Friday night activity. However, if you need a space for a party and you want to treat yourself to a fun night out, Topgolf is a great choice!",

Rental fee for the bay and you play as much golf as you can in the time you rent for which I think is typically 2 hours. There is a regular bar inside as well with a fair amount of seating. The food is sort of standard bar food in my opinion. However, being someone who does not eat meet, I didn't find many options available. My veggie burger was unfortunately very crispy but again, probably not their best dish. The hummus app was good, served with mostly pita and a few cucumbers.

From the moment we arrived, we were treated exceptionally. There was a a young lady waiting in the lobby with a piece of paper listing our groups name. She guided us to the area where we would be spending our time. My first thought was that it would be really cold, since the golfing portion is actually outside. However, they had heaters blasting warm air from above, to the point where, at times, it was almost too hot! They warmed the seating area to the point where we thought the seats were actually heated. Because we had control of the heat, we were able to turn it down/up as we pleased, however there was no real middle ground - it was either hot or cold.   The young lady in the lobby, Ali, ended up being out server for the afternoon. She waited on us, always offering to refill waters, take orders for drinks and food, and even engaged in our banter. She was very pleasant and I highly recommend her if you are able to request someone to wait on you!   The food - slightly more upscale than typical sports bar food! I was impressed with the presentation, especially with the soft pretzel as it contained numerous pick up items within the openings- cubes of cheese, slices of seared kielbasa, candied pecans, grapes, blackberries, and more! It was like a mini charcuterie board inside of the pretzel. The hummus was delicious, the pita bread being my favorite! And the Asian boneless wings had a nice kick. Overall, I was impressed with the food.   As for the golfing experience, what an awesome idea! Whether a beginner or an experienced golfer, there are targets close and far, accommodating all levels of players. Being a lefty, Ali was able to provide me with a full bag of lefty clubs so I could join in the fun. The area we were in was on the far left side, so we did not have any direct shots to the targets which was kind of disappointing. The way the experience is set up is that all the targets are in the center  which is convenient for people sitting in those booths but we were at an end with a sand trap. We also had a little bit of difficulty with the ball display listing the players, number of balls hit, and score. The screen shows you how many balls each person has hit - every now and then it was really slow and if we did not keep track of the balls, we were way past the allotted amount of balls we wanted to hit on that turn. We made it work and enjoyed our time swinging the club!   This is such a fun experience for people of all ages! Good food, excellent service (request Ali from Idaho!), and a unique, competitive activity for you and your friends to try!",

The bays are heated nicely especially to accommodate the cold weather!  Each Bay can hold up to 6 golfers.  In one game each player can hit 20 balls.  They have men's and women's clubs as well as clubs for lefty's.   3.  Each of our guests ordered food and drinks and they all came out quickly!  Refills were speedy and again our waitress was on top of things! 4.  As a large party of 11 - we had a minimum food and beverage allowance of 400$.  We did have a hard time meeting this, so at the end we had to purchase a sweatshirt.  5.  The only other downside is with the heaters directly above us - the granite tables get very hot!  Do not place your phone directly on the table or it will get an over hearing notice.  Also several of us were shocked when walking under the heaters.  Overall we had a great time and would totally go back again!",

The food is notoriously slow. But the biggest drop off is the staff. The friendly faces that I used to see are gone and have been replaced with a pretty intense and grumpy bunch. Like I said, I have been very patient with this establishment.   If there was something like this establishment in existence I would go there, but this business is so unique that they have got me by the nuts.   Oh well!!",

You maybe surprise how good you can be at golf. Not to brag but as a first time golf player, I racked up the highest score among our group. The drinks there are really good. The foods are okay. The customer service was great. Our waiter took care of our team and provided a long list of recommended places to go while in Pittsburgh as first timers. It is a place that would definitely return again.",

    "text": "Top Golf is great. Even if you're a terrible golfer, like myself, it's still fun hanging out, watching what you please on your own TV, and laughing at your friends try to golf.  Other TG's I have been to in the US were much bigger and had more activities to do while you wait for your bay, this particular one only has a couple games to play while you wait (pool table and foosball tables). Your only option is to get a table or wait at the bar.   The bay rental prices are reasonably fair; it varies from $25-$45/hour depending when you go, it's nice that your group can play at their own pace.   I've been on Sunday afternoons, both times it was slow but there were plenty of staff on hand. The staff kind of awkwardly linger around the bays waiting for groups to need something but rest assured you'll get that pitcher refill before your other runs out.   When it comes to food and drink prices, it's comparable to places like Dave & Busters but is still a bit on the pricier side. Pitchers of domestic beer are $16.50 (a little high in my opinion) but do come served with a frozen core to keep the beer cold while your drink your pitcher. They should offer some sort of Happy Hour discounts during the slower hours. The food is pretty good, they have a large menu with plenty of options.   My only complaint is the TG App. It's terrible. It doesn't work well and could really be a nice added touch but as of early November was still experiencing problems.   Overall it's a fun time no matter your skill level. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I went to Top Golf for the first time today and really enjoyed it! It's a really cool concept and they offer something for everyone! This place is huge! The tee areas are called bays, there are three floors full of them! They also have pool tables and foos ball.  I made a reservation on line and it was super easy. They also sent me a text right at my reservation time and told me my bay was ready, and told me which bay to report to. A worker met us at the bay and explained how to use everything. We had two different servers (due to shift change) and both of them very great! You pay by the hour, not per person or by the game, so one hour for me and my husband was plenty.  Before noon the cost is $25 an hour. Noon-9 is $35 an hour, and after 9 is $45 an hour, so the earlier you get there- the better!  I'm hoping this is because it's new- but at this time, Top Golf does not offer any happy hour specials. Which is a shame because the drinks were a little pricy.  One thing about these place that really irked me was the fact that they charge a fee to reserve a bay. $50 to reserve a bay on the weekend!!! Greedy, greedy, greedy!! And charging a $5 membership fee? Why? What's the point, other than to make money?  However, my husband likes to golf and I like to drink- so Top Golf is the perfect date for us so I'm pretty sure we'll be back!",

    "text": "A friend and I came on a Sunday afternoon looking to get some food and play some Topgolf. They were on a wait to play when we arrived so we decided to get something to eat in the main dining area since it wasn't that busy. We were told to sit anywhere we like. The restaurant area was only about half full. After about 10 minutes of no one greeting us, another server that we saw attending tables came over and apologized for the wait and said that she would get our server. We placed an order for a Mimosa and a Pineapple Mojito, queso for an appetizer, and for our entrees a grilled peach salad and spinach goat cheese salad. In addition to receiving the appetizer at the same time as our meals, we received the wrong one and when telling our server, she seemed unapologetic for the mistake. She brought out the correct one shortly after but then we did not see her for the majority of our meal and both ran out of beverages and were not checked in on while eating. We also both asked for water whenever she did come over at the end but she never brought those to us either. We asked one of the guest relations staff at the front desk to grab our server whenever we were notified our bay area was ready since we couldn't seem to get our server to actually wait on us or bring our check. While the food was great, service was pretty terrible.   However, the golf more than made up for the restaurant service which was why I didn't give a one star rating. The bay host was fantastic and personable as well as attentive. The game was very fun and had us laughing and enjoying the rest of our day to make up for the poor restaurant experience. I would definitely go back again but probably only for golfing.",

So we went to the bar to finish while all the employees gave us the side eye and basically made us feel extremely rushed and unwelcome. And they weren't even closed yet. If it was past midnight I would understand, but not at 11:30. If I tried to pull something like that at my work, customers and my manager would be mad. Made me lose some respect for it which is unfortunate because it is one of my favorite places to go. Also the service is extremely slow, which maybe they don't want to seem annoying by checking on you constantly, but it takes forever to order drinks every time.",

However, apart from the poor service prior to receiving our bay, I did not mind the long wait for a bay to golf. The golfing was a lot of fun and it is a great place to go with friends. They really hit a home run with the concept and I can see why it is very successful across the country.

    "text": "Update: they seemed to have changed to only VIP reservations. $200 to reserve a time slot. No thanks   Top golf is a really fun time. I have been here several times and have had mixed experiences.   1) the game itself is very fun. You could be great or terrible at golf and your whole group will have fun  2)this place is EXPENSIVE. You can pay up to $50 for a reservation which does not go toward anything. I understand it assures you don't just skip out but if someone is a no show, hit their card, if the patron shows the money should go toward their game or food. I will never pay for a reservation again, especially since for $50 you can end up against the net on the bottom with no targets near you.  The play itself is also expensive but not bad if if you have a larger group and split it   3) the wait staff and bay attendants have always been great but the desk staff is consistently rude. There are so seems to be a business model of inflated wait times. No matter what time you come, even with a reservation it seems to be a 1 hour wait or longer. Forcing you Into the bar / restaraunt or even the next time slot and increased price   4) the bathroom are always gross. I'm not sure how this happens when there are always at least 4 staff just standing in the front   Overall top golf is very fun and a great splurge for an event.  It's cheaper earlier in the day and more of a night club at night",

Plus we had a Sprint coupon for buy an hour get an hour so - $25 for the bay for two hours!  Perfect amount of time in my opinion.  You get to your bay and they have a nice sized table and chair for folks to sit at - I say parties brining in items like cakes ( I had a coffee)..so for those special occasions it was. Ice to see them allow that!   We got settled and started playing ... then orders $4 mimosas (so good and not watered down which was nice) and some snack...Giant pretzel with fruit meats and cheese ($21), chicken and waffle sliders and chips with queso, salsa and we did an add of quac.  All the food was good and they gave refills on the chips which was awesome!  Sorry no food pics this time.    The bay staff kept coming back over to check on us and about 15 min before your time (which you can see on the screen how much time you have) is up the bay staff came over to ask us if we wanted to continue - another nice perk for first timers.  If your having fun you can add time.    All in all we had a wonderful morning there and highly recommend for even those that don't play and just want to go have fun ;)",

The waitress had failed to mention the lack of apple juice etc only after we had placed our food and drink orders, then the person carrying the food had placed our food at the wrong table/bay, where other people ended up eating our food after we had waited forever to receive. Then the waitress did not bother trying to make the situation correct or by compensating myself and my group, she literally gave a lackluster sorry and tossed all of our food into the trash bins next to our table. The waitress leaves again into an abyss, another hour or so has gone by. When the waitress finally came back with the replacement food, it was way too salty that it wasn't even tolerable. Also, we had to keep reminding her to refill our drinks constantly; ridiculous, especially when she keeps asking \"how's everything?\" but doesn't bother attending to our requests. For generic cocktails and typical bar food, you would hope for better service especially if they are overpriced. I have had better service and food at Denny's to be quite honest.   By the end, the receipt was just a blank sheet with some texts and our total costs - there is no breakdown of what each food, drinks, or game play costs; total lack of transparency. There could have been hidden fees that no microscope could have detected. The games and experience was great, anything pertaining to the food service was anything but great - disappointing!",

    "text": "Top golf has become an increasingly popular past time in the past couple of years. As a bar, food joint, and gamified driving range, Topgolf has it all! It's a great place to go even if you're not an avid golfer. It's comparable to a night out bowling in that one person takes a turn at the driving range at a time. When it's not your turn to golf, there is a comfy, modern seating area. This arrangement allows for big groups. We had a company happy hour here which was a lot of fun! Their catering has tasty food, and the wait staff are attentive but not overbearing. The food and drink menu is extensive even if you're not getting a buffet. I hope to be back!",

    "text": "First time ever going to a Topgolf location and was pleasantly impressed by how clean and technologically advanced it was. The road leading to the location was off the beaten path as they seemed to be building on the large acreage of land.   The location is clearly seen from route 79 and visibly marked along washington pike road. There is extensive parking in the lot and isn't too far away from the venue.   Upon walking into the location we were greeted by a concierge asking if we needed help and were then directed to the front desk. After adding our names and how many we had in the group (only my wife and myself) we were informed of a 45 minute wait. Bare in mind this is 8pm at night on a Tuesday. To me that did not seem unreasonable so we ventured over to one of the three bars on site. The bar was upscale, the waitress and serving staff were very helpful and polite.   Once we grabbed a bite to eat and a couple of beers we waited the 45 minutes and right on time we were notified of our bay. Once outside it's a whole different atmosphere. Each bay was outfitted with a tv you could change the channel to and a table your whole party could sit at and wait while everyone golfed.   My takeaways from the visit:  Pros -clean -staff is welcoming  -the place is HUGE -many other things to do than golf         -billiards tables, foosball, bar, etc -well lit scoring was spot on  Cons -Bathrooms were tiny, for mens 2 stalls and 2 urinals for the whole floor -You are going to spend money for everything.         -drinks, bay time, food, membership   Overall a fantastic time, will come back and enjoy with more friends!",

We reserved our bay in advance and would suggest doing this as many people were waiting to get their turn. Loved that we were able to get a bay with a couch - made for easy entertaining and controlled the kids.   Food was your typical pub food and came out hot and fast. Staff was attentive and helped us get started with ease. Would highly recommend the boneless wings, the sauces were on point.   If your an avid golfer, bring your own clubs.",

You'll want to make sure to plan at least a couple of weeks out in order to get a reservation.  This is especially True on the weekends, as the bays book fast.  You can try to just show up and hope to get lucky, but plan to wait for at least an hour.  The service has been great each time I was there.  We did have to wait long for food one time, but the place was packed so I kind of expected it.  The food options I have had have all been delicious.  My favorite is the bacon mac and cheese spring rolls.  These are one of the best and most unique appetizers I have ever had.  They come with a side of their ranch which is also very good and pairs perfect with the spring rolls.  I have also had the buffalo chicken sliders which were wonderful as well.  My only complaint is the setup of the targets.  If you end up on the left side, you really don't have much to shoot for.  Definitely try to get a middle to right spot if you can.",

They have SO MANY food and drink options. A lot of creative different snacks/drinks as well. Go for brunch on the weekend and get the Mimosa spread!  It definitely is a bit on the pricey side, but you typically spend a few hours here so you get what you pay for!   Side note: if you go in the winter they have large heaters in each bay.

I have been to this location a few times for both work events and personal get together, and I am never blown away. I think it's something cool to try once and maybe go back every once in a while, but nothing I wanna do on the regular. I do however understand those who have a love for it. Top golf is fun for groups and if you aren't big on playing multiple games, just hit every once in a while & drink in between. The thing that really gets me is the price. It is REALLY expensive. I would personally rather go drive golf balls at the driving range than go here to play the games on the screens, but that's just me.   Pros: Full bar Friendly service  Easy to find location  Plenty of parking Many bay areas  Accommodating to groups Cheaper than taking people golfing at a country club  Heat lamps that keep you warm, even in the winter  Completely covered, protected from rain/weather   Cons: The food is mediocre & over priced  Expensive  Always a wait on the weekends $ to reserve the bay does not go towards your bill  Balls aren't swept up enough so often the one you hit will not roll in as it bumps in to an old one  Some targets are very difficult to hit unless you have a center bay  Overall, I will return for company events I'm sure and id recommend checking this place out if you haven't yet and are looking for to do.",

The facility has three tiers of golf bays available. My husband and I visited on a Sunday and were able to golf right away without reserving a bay. Once we arrived at our assigned bay, a waitress greeted us promptly and made sure our game was setup correctly and took our drink orders. She visited us regularly and was very friendly. The golf game itself was really fun, and we enjoyed the variety of games to play. We plan on returning this summer with my in-laws. There were kids and adults of all ages playing, so this is a great location for families and friends. I highly recommend this facility for something different and fun to do!",

    "text": "The first time I came to top golf was around August, and the wait was about 2 hours. Decided to try again, but this time we reserved a bay ahead of time online. Mon-Wed you can reserve a bay at no charge, Thursday's are $10, and I believe weekends are $50. FYI, the reservations are non-refundable.   When we got there, I signed in and we had a bay set up for us right away. It wasn't too busy on a Monday night, there were only a couple other parties there. We had a reservation at 9:30PM, so the cost was $45/hr per bay. Other rates vary $25-$45 depending on what time of the day you go. They don't charge you by person, but if you've never been to topgolf, it costs $5 for a membership. The membership is a one time cost and works at all locations. You can only have 6 people play per bay, but 8 people can be in the bay.   I'm not a golf person at all, so I wasn't expecting to have a lot of fun, but it was actually so much fun! It would be fun for kids, beginners, pros, heck even my elderly grandpa had fun. It is a little hard, but you do get the hang of it. There's also different games you can play to make it more tough and etc.   The food was okaaaay. My favorite thing was the chicken and waffle sliders! Dip it with the syrup and it's delicioussss. The gravy was meh. We also ordered pretzels, cheesy fries, wings, the buffalo sliders (wouldn't recommend that, it was way too salty), and some beer.   Emily was such a great server! She helped us throughout the whole process, was very attentive, had a lot of patience with our group, and was just awesome. She made our experience very enjoyable!  I'm glad that they added a topgolf to Pittsburgh, cause it's one more thing I can do when I visit family here. I would highly recommend checking it out, and reserving a spot online to avoid any long waits.",

We checked in and were told it could be up to two hours before we got a spot. Like I mentioned we knew were didn't make a reservation (it's almost $50 to reserve a bay and the money doesn't go towards anything)  so we headed to the bar area to have a drink. To our surprise we waited less than 20 minutes.   Our server promptly explained the rules, menu and safety tips. It's $5 for a game card if you haven't been before and $47 per hour for the bay. Each bay holds up to 6 people so over all the cost isn't bad. We played for two hours total. Each bay has different games you can play and ways you can earn points. Our server was prompt and had our food and drink orders out in no time. The food and drink costs are where you will spend the most $$$. Nothing exceptional about the food, pretty typical of what you'll find at a sporting arena. They also have a DJ on site.   Overall, the atmosphere and experience was great. We couldn't ask for a better night. Highly recommend if you're looking for something different on a weekend or place to host an event. We'll be back in the future.",

Angela, the event coordinator, was wonderful - and made sure that our group was 100% happy from start to finish. The food we had, amazing. Drinks, amazing. The only reason for 4 stars, it was a bit unorganized in a sense that they kind of just expected us to know hot to start games/get set up - when most of us have never been to topgolf. Would have been great to have a mini briefing on those things. Also, the servers were great for the most part but some of them had a bit of a negative attitude which I wasn't a fan of.

We got two bays right next to each other and our waitress was nice and accommodating and split up everything we needed in the end for everyone.   The food is typical bar type food and was not anything to rush back for. But nice to be able to eat and hang out while golfing. Their drink menu was pretty big with mix and match buckets of beer so everyone could get what they wanted.   Our group was made up of experienced golfers and people who do not golf at all, and everyone had a fun time! Even if you aren't great, you can still get points in the different types of group games you can select from. I would definitely recommend this place for a group and to experience something fun and different on a night out.",

I really liked it, about what you would spend at a driving range, but with some cool games. We got a bay on the third floor and the process was quick. Different times cost different so check out pricing before hand.  Food was really good, but the kitchen was so slow. We did come on a Friday night, so I'm sure that didn't help, but no excuses, you should be able to accommodate what you allow in. Even drinks were slow, which was crazy. It almost forces you to play more to wait for what you ordered, which is not a cool move. Hopefully not the goal though.  Some other stuff to do, they have a few bars, DJ, foosball. Both kid and adult friendly, pro and beginner friendly, and they have clubs there, just like the bowling alley would for bowling.",

    "text": "We visited Top Golf on a Friday night and i thought the idea of the golf experience was a great concept.  We had a reservation for 3 hours with drink and food service.  The drinks flowed easily and our waitress, Leah, could not have been sweeter.  She was very personable and extremely competent at her job.  We had a taco bar which was very good as well.   That being said, I can only give Top Golf a 2 star review because of the music.  It was so loud that we couldn't even hear each other talk and golfing with it was impossible.  Even the wait staff said it had never been that loud before.  Not sure what the management was thinking.  I understand that they have the dance floor but did the Deejay have to blast it thru out the whole establishment!  We were there to celebrate a recent couple's engagement and some family members were meeting for the first time-not very conducive to carrying on a conversation! I was very disappointed because of this and could not recommend it especially since it is rather pricey for what we got.",

With noticing we would not have enough time to travel to our wedding location after golf, we decided needed to push the day back that we would come visit the facility. The person we spoke with, Jessica, would not let us change the date or give us any credit to use at a later date. The only option given to us would be pay even MORE money to move the date. Needless to say they just robbed our group of $200, and now none of us or our friends will be visiting a Top Golf location.",

Was looking forward to trying this place out. 1st attempt was last minute and we was told we would have to wait at least 45 minutes. Reasonable enough like it's a new place in town we arrived last minute but decided not to wait, not personally an atmosphere for me crowded and hectic and unclear instructions at the door. \"One check in over her and the other stand over here\"... I don't get it if we both need a membership shouldn't  both of us go o checkout? Oh and we have to stand over there for almost an hour? \"No we can text you when a bay is available\"...not for that so I can get annoying text later no way...just a quick nutshell of 1st attempted, bad on us last minute showing up expecting a good time...  2nd attempt- make a reservation in advance 7 days. Easy enough....READ fine print catch that could rip you off...$25 or whatever your reservation fee does not count towards cost of bay rental. So $25 to reserve add another $25 when u get there for your time wich may not happen and if you haven't gotten your membership yet add another $10. $60 in total for two because making a sketchy you still may have to Waite in a line reservation cost you as much as the bay rental WTF....TURN OFF, reservation canceled thankfully reread fine print before i over paid.",

    "text": "I recently visited Top Golf with my wife (she doesn't know we're married, long story) and we had an interesting time. You have to wave your club over the ball sensor about 2,374 before a ball comes out. At least 30 minutes of our hour was spent trying to figure out who's turn it was. Occasionally two balls would come out simultaneously. That really confused my \"wife\" and I. We accidentally started hitting shots for the other person so our scores were inaccurate. This wouldn't have been a problem except for the small detail that my \"wife\" is insanely competitive and I was on pace to break the all time high score in TopGolf history. This led to a huge argument between the two of us on the way home. When I got home I tried to apologize to my \"wife\" and comfort her with a hug and a kiss. She brushed me off then left our house with my dog. Now I have no \"wife\" and no best friend. Thanks for ruining my marriage and having my best friend taken away from me. If you get me a new puppy, all will be forgiven. We should have gone to Chuck E Cheese. Unfortunately I'm not allowed within a hundred yards of any Chuck E Cheese location in the greater Pittsburgh area. On the plus side the pretzel bites were absolutely sublime. 5 stars!  Edit: I found my wife playing skeeball at Chuck E Cheese. She was having no issues getting the balls out of the machine. I had to wait for her for three hours as she let out her frustrations from TopGolf on that poor skee ball machine. She pummeled that skeeball ramp with wooden ball after wooden ball until she had to be forcibly removed because she was deemed \"a threat to the children and Chuck\". She was taken to the Scott Township police station where she was charged with aggrivated assault against the skeeball machine and wreckless endangerment of children. She was in jail for over 8 hours. It was a long wait. Speaking of waits.. I forgot to mention that we waited in line for a half hour. There were only 2 people in front of us. The woman working the front desk seemed as if she was playing a game called \"suck at your job\". She's really good at that game. Speaking of games. I really liked the different varieties of games you can play at TopGolf. Unfortunately I only had enough time for one game because you can only hit 12 shots in an hour. The Foosball table was a welcome reprieve from the terrifying looks I was getting from my \"wife\" as she seethed in anger. The water was on par with a bottle of Fiji and really kept me from becoming dehydrated because of all of the thrashing I had to do to just get one ball out of the machine. Speaking of machines, I saw a peasant there who had his own clubs and he played golf like a machine. I watched him play for a while and he was in a groove. Every shot this peseant hit was right at the center of the target. Until, you guessed it, he started having issues with the balls coming out too slow. At one point he started swinging with one leg while the other waved back and forth across the ball sensor. As I watched the peseant who brought his own golf clubs to TopGolf leave he was clearly frustrated with his sabotaged round that started off electric. The only thing I could compare this peseant to was tiger woods. Speaking of woods, the free woods you guys let people use were made in the early 90s. Next time I'm bringing my own clubs like that other peseant. Bathrooms were very nice! 5 stars!",

I have no complaints about the games, the bays, or the clubs (and neither did the actual golfers with me). The only negative thing I could say is about the drink orders. The first time I went, I was told they could only make one margarita on the menu whenever there were 3-4 options. This was fine, but why? My friend also asked the difference between two separate drinks on the menu and was told they were the same exact thing? Also, the Tito's Top Bloody drink was ordered and to come with toppings of celery, bacon, pickle, lemon, etc; however none of the toppings were served with the drink. My next visit consisted of the same thing: the server asked if I wanted my margarita frozen, which I did, but it was brought to me \"on the rocks\" and I was told frozen was out of season. I didn't care too much, but the others in my party felt that this information should have been told to us before ordering, or the drink should have been taken off the bill. I'm still giving 4 stars because none of this ruined my night at all, just maybe the servers need to be more familiar with the menu?",

As a tourist I've been to many top golfs Vegas being one of my favorite and it get 10x more people then pitt and they still Some how manage to make everyone happy!

From the moment we arrived at Top Golf, we were hit by a wall of noise from the music and general operation of the location.  The check in process was tedious as the counter staff had to shout at us and we had to shout back just to be heard.  Pricing is generally reasonable, but it makes no sense why everyone needs to buy a membership to just hit a few balls.  Also, the lifetime and single use membership are both $ 5, but thankfully I can go to Top Golf in Sydney, Australia, since I bought a lifetime membership (why?).  Things went a little better when we got to the bay although it was clear most of the wait staff are not real happy to be there.  We had fun golfing, but again due to the excessively loud music, it was impossible to talk to anyone.  You couldn't speak with someone three feet away from you with out shouting.  Food was decent - one par with what you can get at an Applebees or TGI Fridays.  Unfortunately, they serve Pepsi products.  The golf itself was fine and fun, but again the excessive noise just ruined the entire trip.",
