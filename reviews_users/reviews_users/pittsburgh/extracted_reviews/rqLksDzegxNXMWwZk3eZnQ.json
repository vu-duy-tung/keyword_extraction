It is not too sweet, just right. For appetizer, I go with Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower flitters with spicy sauce).",

My son, who is a very picky eater, absolutely loves it as well.  Everything is made to order so it's always fresh.  The girl who works the counter (Brown curly hair) is very nice and always chit chats with me as I wait on my order, so I feel her customer service is on point. They must be doing something right as they are always super busy when I go down.  I have tried 2 other places in the area (downtown Pittsburgh) and the food I've gotten at cafe Delhi is far more superior and it's even less expensive. I feel that the portions are large because I always get 2 meals out of one order, so to me that makes it an even better value.",

Recently many Indians are coming on H1B and making big salaries as technical and managerial, these guys simply see the demand and keep rising the prices without quality. The tables are very small so I do not prefer to eat in the restaurant. Avoid this place. They just rob you.

    "text": "My wife and I are visiting Pittsburgh from the Indian food wasteland that is South Carolina, and craving our favorite food we consulted Yelp, which resulted in a trip to Cafe Delhi in Carnegie.  I will start with criticism and then will move on to praise (of which I wish to heap a great deal).  The ambiance of Cafe Delhi is not very nice, reminiscent of a cheap takeaway restaurant in London in which the food is considered important but the act of dining is a mere afterthought.  The tables are not very nice, the walls fairly plain, and you order at a counter rather than a waiter visiting your table.  There is no alcohol served but BYOB is acceptable, and they do provide a bottle opener and wine glasses should you bring a nice vino.  The menus are a single laminated sheet of paper, and are honestly a bit on the grungy side.  If your goal is to eat fine Indian food, then do not let these observations alarm you.  If you are properly armed with these expectations, Cafe Delhi will be a very good experience.    Our visit was on a snowy Pittsburgh evening.  We parked in the public parking lot nearly behind the building, which is free after 6pm.  A very brief walk delivered us to the threshold of Cafe Delhi.  Upon entering, we were handed our menus and instructed to order at the counter once we'd made our decision.  They immediately noticed our bottle of wine and brought us wine glasses and a bottle opener.   We seated ourselves at a table of our choosing in a corner, and my wife and I both decided on the Butter Chicken.  I often try this on a first visit to an Indian restaurant to gauge the quality of the food, and even if it is not the most complex in flavour, if done well will still deliver a delightful taste and texture.  We were asked how hot we would like our dishes, to which end my wife had mild and I medium.  I initially said 'hot' but was warned that 'hot' was a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.  We were asked if we wanted naan or rice, which was a little unexpected as in my experience this isn't usually an either/or proposition, but I opted to pay a bit more and had both.  We also ordered vegetable samosas as an appetizer, which we did not regret.  I requested mango chutney but was told they only carried tamarind and mint chutneys, which was quite acceptable.  After a wait of about 10 to 15 minutes our samosas arrived.  I had actually asked for \"two samosas\" but this was evidently received as \"two orders\", in which there are two per order.  No matter, as this allowed us to have a bit more the next day.  The samosas were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just as they should be.  The taste was excellent, and rivaled that of fine Indian restaurants I've eaten at in other cities.  Both chutneys tasted very good; the tamarind was a bit on the sweet side and the mint had a nice spice and bite to it.  Our entrees arrived about two minutes later which was a bit too soon, but again, no matter.  With one samosa dispatched apiece, we moved on to our Butter Chicken.  We were not disappointed.  The sauce was smooth and creamy, with a nice silkiness.  The taste was exquisite, and we savoured every bite.  The individual spices are discernible, and you can tell that they do not merely rely on fat to make a good flavour.  The naan was also very hot and tasty, and provided just enough crispness to delight the senses.  If you eat slowly and savour each bite, whatever shortcomings Cafe Delhi may have can be easily overlooked. C'est bon!",

After settling Indian, I briefly remembered some buzz around a cafe out in the Carnegie area (who'da guessed?).  Cafe Delhi is part of an Indian cultural center, which at first thought, I wasn't sure if I was going to get knock your socks off good staples or the equivalent of ho-hum church cafeteria food...  good thing it was the first!  The staff were all great.  They use an at-the-counter ordering method, so after placing our order, we went outside to the small garden patio and grabbed a table.  We were quickly met with water (kinda a hybrid semi-full service...  think Buffalo Wild Wings) and asked if we would want anything else.   Both my Butter Chicken and the Wife's Chicken Vindaloo were fantastic (although we both left feeling slightly weighted down...  they don't call it butter chicken for no reason).  We'll definitely go back at some point.  For some lack of oversight, I failed to order myself a few of their variations of naan bread, so that will be enough reason alone to revisit this gem!",

My wife and I are Indian restaurant aficionados and we've journeyed to almost every one in the Pittsburgh area.  Cafe Delhi is among the best, and easily has the best prices and the fastest friendliest service of any of them.  Almost every dish on the menu is just $4-$8, so you can easily get a few things to try.  You'll want to, because it's too hard to choose between the huge number of options.  The dishes have their traditional Indian names, with English descriptions underneath, which I found very helpful.  They offer to spice everything as you request from 1-10 and we all found their spice levels to be perfect, very full flavored but never overwhelming.  Despite the low prices, the portion sizes are generous, and we ended up taking home enough leftovers for a future Indian feast!  The only negative is that the restaurant is fairly unassuming, with a simple awning to mark the front, and little in the way of decoration or atmosphere inside.  That said, it's clean, well maintained, and the waiters were responsible and helpful.  Cafe Delhi believes, as I do, that nothing should distract away from food as the center of the dining experience.  Get ready for a diverse offering of fantastic dishes, fast service, generous portions and an unbelievable value.  I do not throw 5 star ratings around lightly, but Cafe Delhi has absolutely earned the highest possible rating.  I'm tempted to move next door, just so I can eat there every day!",

I order Aloo Gobi and was blown away by how fresh the ingredients were. The seasoning was absolutely perfect. Perfumed actually... Naan which is often a meh side was also fresh. I order the garlic and is was loaded with fresh garlic and clearly not from a box. If I HAD to come up with a complaint it would be there was not enough rice to enjoy the wonderful sauce. Next time I'll ask for more. I cannot wait to take my family here, or just come back myself. You will not be disappointed by the food here...at all. For those complaining about portion sizes...GIVE ME A BREAK!!!! The portions here are absolutely normal for any city in the USA...

We said yes and began to look at what we wanted to order.  A guy behind us sitting at a table said \"excuse me? Excuse me! Are u trying to order?\"  Which we responded \"yes\" & thinking why else would we be looking at menus and standing at the counter. He abruptly said \"we are closed!\" We said the open sign is on? Confused, thinking well why did you hand us menus? We received no answers and the girl ran over to shut the open sign off.  So we walked out pretty disgusted by the service receiving no apology for the confusion.  As we walked out we realized they close at 2:30 and open again at 4:30.  They just didn't want to serve us so close to closing for 2 hrs. There was no consideration or offer of a to-go order or anything. SO RUDE! No respect for frequent and loyal customers.

I recommend the chicken tikka, goat curry, samosa chat, paneer wraps and malai kafta.   I've eaten here at least six times and every time the quality and taste of the food is reliable.  I love it and will continue to frequent.",

    "text": "Meh.. I've experienced better - same place but last year.  This is actually for the Indian Community Center (ICC) which Cafe Delhi provides the food (buffet style) including the services.  I attended an event celebrating a Annual Hindu Festival this past Saturday and I believe this was their second year celebrating this annual event at the ICC. The place itself is really neat - used to be a church. They place is very spacious and has pretty much everything needed to host a wedding or a large event.  Unlike last year, they did not provide us with enough hors d'oeuvre - Let alone second help, it was barely enough to begin with for a group of about 100 including children. Despite requesting more of the appetizers and promising more - we gave up and thought we'll just wait for the main course.  The dinner started okay until it needed to be refilled. There was barely any meat in few of the curry (meat) items and the food items (that needed to be refilled) was not done in a timely manner. Eventually after complaining/requesting about the lack of food and the service - they filled up few of the items but by then it was too late and most of the attendees were already getting ready to leave.  Don't get me wrong - The food here is pretty good. But just good enough to feed 50% of the guest.",

    "text": "While the menu here has plenty of vegetarian options, they don't offer much in the way of actual vegetables. And the food is just not good. I went with another person, and we chose the Navratan Korma and Chicken Chettinad to share. Navratan Korma, when made well, is the jewel in a good Indian chef's repertoire. It's a Mughlai dish that features \"nine gems\", a mix of nine vegetables and sometimes paneer cheese in a rich creamy sauce with some nuts and dried fruit. It's a rich dish, and I usually avoid it if there is another curry on the menu that doesn't feature cream, but, as I said, vegetables were scarce. The korma that arrived at our table wasn't a korma at all, but previously frozen vegetables (I can always tell...can't you?) in a sauce that had the color and flavor of a processed cheese sauce. Kind of like Kraft macaroni and cheese without the macaroni. This dish is an affront to the idea of korma, and laughably bad.   We fared a little better with the chicken chettinad, which was spicy and somewhat flavorful, although the chicken was served in a bowl that was too small for the contents, and it hadn't been cut into small enough pieces to eat without a knife. I wasn't actually given a knife to use, but had I been, I would have made a mess of my plate.   I have no idea why you would have air fresheners in your dining room. Air fresheners are meant to go in a bathroom, where I still don't like them, but understand their use. Every 30 seconds or so the 2 wall mounted units sent another spritz of chemical aroma into the dining room. Yuck. Dining rooms should smell of food. Maybe these people don't even have that much confidence in their cooking skills. It's too bad, as this is a nice location near a charming stretch of Main Street. Needless to say, I won't be returning.",

    "text": "2.5 stars if I could but I'm willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt and try it again.  I ordered the samosa chaat and the malai kofta with naan while the boyfriend ordered the tandoori chicken with naan.    The samosa chaat was decent and for Pittsburgh standards pretty good.  I did find a few tomatoes mixed in and was disappointed by the lack of authenticity.  I would try some of the other chaats since I did enjoy this appetizer - it's no Bombay chaat but it'll have to do in the 'Burgh.  On to the Malai Kofta, the best way to describe this dish is nacho cheese sauce with vegetable dumplings, two dumplings to be exact.  Yes, two measly dumplings in a sea of cheese like sauce.  Please be reminded that Malai Kofta is not meant to have any cheese so I'm not sure why it tasted so.  Needless to say, I wasn't a fan.  The vegetable dumplings were good, but I did expect to get more than 2.  The naan was also disappointing as it was apparent they weren't cooked in a clay oven and had that typical naan flavor.  Maybe I ordered the wrong dish and perhaps I should've stuck with my usual Indian dish that I order at all Indian restaurants (chicken tikka masala) but thought I'd expand my horizons.  I tried my boyfriend's tandoori chicken and while it looked very appetizing it was missing the distinctly tandoori flavor and spice.    I don't think I'd make a special trip to come by again but if I was in the area, I'd try some of the other appetizers.",

The menu on the wall behind the counter only lists the items with no description.  However, while we were eating we did notice someone waiting to order who was flipping through something that looked like it was a more detailed version of the menu with pictures.  Not sure if that's what it was, but I may ask next time when I bring the hubby who only knows Indian food by site (he frequents Indian buffets).  Although, the staff seemed friendly enough that I'm sure they wouldn't mind describing the items if asked.   The food came out fairly quickly (although there weren't many other diners at that time) and our waters were never empty for long.  I got the Malai Kofta with a side of naan (you get a choice of naan or rice with your entree).  It was very tasty and creamy, but a bit on the salty side.  The side of naan was hot, fresh, buttery and plentiful (I couldn't even eat all of it, which never happens to me when it comes to bread).  My friend, who frequents the place, ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and said it is always very good.    Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this place and will be back!",

Cafe Delhi is located in part of what was a church that was dormant for years. Thanks to the current owners, it has been transformed into a modern Indian restaurant alongside a convention hall. I love to frequent locally owned businesses, and I especially like it when someone invests and improves their neighborhood. There's a dozen tables inside the restaurant and an outside patio with 3-4 tables that sits in a cool, shaded courtyard. We sat out there on an 80+ degree day and it felt nice and cool. As for the food, everything I've tried is delicious. I'm a big fan of the chicken kurma, which has a thick sauce and lots of chunks of chicken. It comes with either a side of delicate rice or their tasty naan (a flat bread), and my recommendation is to ask for both rice and naan, which is only a $1 more. Everything else I've had is fresh and delicious, and they let you choose your spice level with a 1-10 so you can decide if you're bold or a wuss. Delicious food, great location, and almost everything on the menu is under $10. Plus, the portions are big, the place is clean, and the service is good and friendly. Thanks for putting such a cool place in Carnegie!",

They also give choice of rice or naan with the dishes which is uncommon and amazing for us naan-lovers!",

The service model is different here wherein you need to order at counter and later pay for your meals there too.  What I love on the menu are the appetizers. They got Samosa chaat and Chicken 65 pretty straight of what you'll get in India. Paani puri leaves a bit to be desired though.  Now my favorite item: Ginger chicken! It's a curry based preparation which comes along with either naan or white rice. Its hot, tangy and on a scale of 10, a 7 will burn you. In a good way!  Apart from that chicken fried rice and chicken biryaani are quite decent options.  The place itself seems to be in a rather deserted area but don't let it affect your judgement.  Update: I've recently come to love their Butter Scotch Pastries. They are exceptionally good!",

This cafe is really a cafe - you order food at the counter, take a number and they bring out the food to you. I believe it's a  BYOB place since I saw some people outside pulling out a bottle of wine. (Hint: there's a wine/spirits store a block away.) Anyway, I had the mango lassi, chicken lollipop, goat vindaloo and chili (chily) paneer. All were delicious! I also ordered a caramel cake but sadly forgot to eat it. The gentleman at the counter was so nice, he threw in a pineapple cake in at no charge. My friend said it was fantastic and that she would go back just for the cake! We are definitely coming back when the urge for Indian food arises.",

Egg Curry, Bhindi, Dahi Poori, Mushroom Masala and salty lassi are all to die for! They even make a couple things as good as her (gasp!!). Cannot speak for the meats but the way they make everything, I'd imagine it to be super tasty as well!   The ONLY thing I would improve would be the speed of service. They get backed up usually from ~7:15 to 9:00 so set aside an hour+ if you go during that window. I have been there 4 times already, which for me is a lot for any single establishment, much less one I'm picky about.",

I am not vegetarian so I ordered the spinach chicken. It was a little different from what I'm used to as the spinach was completely pureed in the sauce, but the flavor was so good! The spice level I chose (6) was perfect in the amount of heat. The chicken was good quality and the naan that I ordered with it was perfectly chewy, crispy, and buttery. We split the samosas which I could tell were freshly made as they were piping hot and super crisp. I could make a meal out of them alone. My friend ordered a dosa which I tried and I'd definitely venture to order that next time. The accompanying sauces were so delicious! I give the food a 5 star review. The space itself is clean and orderly, but there were space heaters out on the floor. It was an especially cold day so the constant flow of take out orders and door opening over and over left the dining area pretty chilly. Service was pleasant. You order at the counter and then go to a table with your number. I can't wait to try more!",

They have air fresheners on the walls spurting chemicals at you while you eat!  I asked about it and the guy said it was to cover up the bad smells!  I asked what bad smell and didn't get an answer. It should smell like delicious Indian food not whatever was loaded in these units.   I heard they're owned by Mintt and the cakes are made there. I'm wondering what else isn't made here.",

The food had good taste but was way too creamy... we felt like every dish had heavy cream added. We are used to the veggies and spices ringing through for the Indian we like. The spinach paneer is usually mainly just spinach with the chunks of paneer but this was more of a spinach soup with cream base. We were also disappointed there were no dishes with eggplant. Surprising for us. In any case, the food had good flavor but felt it was more of a \"fast food\" Indian joint than a restaurant.",

You would want to plan and come a little early if you would like to be seated immediately. We discovered this treasure of a place very recently and have been a regular since!  The ambiance is that of a cafe as the name suggests, it isn't as big as a restaurant. They operate like a cafe, you have to place your order at the counter and seat yourself, pretty much self-service.  The staff is pretty friendly.  The food however is the highlight, as should be! They have the most authentic Indian food of all the Indian restaurants we have tried in Pittsburgh. They have a variety of snack options too which is another thing that sets them apart from the other Indian restaurants in the area.  It will take a few visits to gauge your comfort with the spice level of the food here though. We are a couple that has a pretty decent spice tolerance, however an 8/10 was too Spicy for us, a 5 or 6 is what I would suggest if you are into spicy food and way lesser if you aren't.  We are now a regular and will be unless we find something better which we doubt!",

    "text": "With over 50 items on an extensive menu ranging from noodles, wraps, dosas, pav bhaji, soup, parathas, Naan, biriyani and several types of curries, Cafe Delhi is trying to be a typical Indian fast food bistro. Sadly, I can't say it succeeds. What these types of joints back in India get right, is consistency. Also, the cook making dosas would focus just on that and the cook handling the Indo-Chinese preparations wouldn't also be in charge of biriyani. That's how they turn around high quality despite the breadth of menu offerings. Without that kind do staffing, it's unsurprising that Cafe Delhi doesn't get much right. Not even their masala chai. My spring dosa was missing the 'assortment of veggies', per their menu and was instead just overstuffed with a ton of potato. The paneer is chewy and the chilly paneer arrived sitting in a pool of oil. The naan is just about as good as frozen store bought naan. (Choolaah in Shadyside for me is the gold standard of paneer and naan.) The gobi manchurian is the only item remotely well prepared. Servers are way too busy to make recommendations or even eye contact for that matter. The dishes are simply plonked on the table randomly wherever they find empty space and one's left to figure out which one is whose. I wasn't too happy with cleanliness levels either.  I've given this place a few tries and I get that Cafe Delhi satisfies a certain type of patron. If I needed my Indian-food-fix on a regular, almost daily basis, needed variety and if I didn't know how to cook, then maybe I'd've lowered my standards. But none of that applies to me and hence the rating. I wouldn't go to or recommend Cafe Delhi unless someone in the group really NEEDS  chaat or a dosa that night.",

The staff has always been kind and generous; a few times when I place a take out order, they offer a complimentary pop or chai tea...what a nice touch!  There are so many good things to try, I don't know where to start. I once found myself ordering 6 items for just my husband and myself...oops!! The samosa is always a good choice. Their pakoras are even better. I like to have the bhel puri as an afternoon snack. The masala dosa is a family favorite too. Their Pav Bhaji is second only to my mother-in-laws. Okay, one more...the Chana bhatura is always fun, but definitely order it if you're dining in. Now you know all of the dishes I order all the time, try them for yourself!",

    "text": "Had my doubts about this place because it looks like a slightly sketchy neighborhood but boy, was I wrong! Got here around lunch time on a Saturday (~noon) and it was very slow... Not sure if this place is usually slow or if it's bc it's a holiday weekend.   Customer service up to par, which is very important to me. The person who took my order was very pleasant. He told me to order my entree with naan, and hooked me up with a bowl of rice.   Ordered:  -Chicken tikka masala: it came in a smaller bowl than I anticipated but it was actually just the right amount with my sides of naan and rice. I felt like there was a lot more sauce than chicken... And probably could've been better with more... But no complaints.  -Mango Lissa: came in a tiny cup. Was hoping it'd be made to order / fresh but he pulled it out pre made from the display. It was still good but wish it was colder.  -Tandoori chicken: got 4 pieces of chicken and should be more than enough for 1 person. It was flavorful and overall, no complaints.   They have spice levels 1-10 (mild to hot). The 8 had a kick but I didn't think it was as spicy as an 8 should be. It was actually pretty close to the level 5 spice.   They have indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating can be under a roof, or completely out in the open.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fourfoodieventures.com&s=e3cec629167b2ccc72ab6a83e75c38bf55bef96bb52c8638d59157a166b98a0c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ourfoodieventures.com</a>",

    "text": "4 stars overall.  In my opinion, the best indian food in town (second best if you include Chez Moi or Chez anybody who's indian mom cooks up a storm).  Anyhow, when I move to a new town, my staples are where is the nearest Taco Bell (oh look...what's that falling straight to hell...well the validity of all my reviews of course - it's a Indian thing, you won't get it), where is the nearest Zara (fail), where is the nearest coffee shop, and what's the best indian restaurant in town.  Well, I tried them all in Pittsburgh except for this one given it's location out in the boondocks of Carnegie. A colleague recommended it and he said it's the closest thing to \"restaurant style\" indian food you're going to get that is reminiscent of India and back east(er) in Queens, NY.  So I went.  I ate.  I was conquered.  If it is anything I know, it's Indian food.  This is great food. My go to's are the Chicken Malai Kabab (very well cooked, juicy pieces of tender chicken breast marinated in yogurt, cheese, cilantro, ginger among other spices), the spinach chicken and the Chicken Pepper Fry.  One of the reasons why Indian Food in general can be unhealthy is the extraordinary amount of oil or cream. I love their butter chicken and tikka masala but their butter chicken is loaded with cream (I can see the fat separate sometimes) as well as the Spinach chicken (but not much because spinach can be creamed by cooking it well). The tikka masala is great but it seems like they forgot  a key ingredient in theirs which would be black cardamoms and Javentri (Mace) which gives it that flavor. The butter chicken is on point, and the spinach chicken is too die for. Perfectly cooked pieces of dark meat in a spinach curry laced with cloves. It's like eating crack.  I love that it comes with naan or rice so I usually get one of each. The naan is your typical naan, nothing extraordinary.  My review for this place is overall quality and taste of food which I think they nailed.  My only thing is, for take out, I think they can give a little bit more meat in their dishes...JUST saying, sometimes there is way more gravy than protein and well, that is no Bueno considering other restaurants really don't do this.  Saved by the bell in that their food surpasses others in the area so Kudos.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try this little spot for a very long time and finally made it. We arrived as they were reopening for dinner, at 430p. It was uncomfortably cold in the restaurant, so we sat near the space heaters they had around some of the tables.  So you sit and look at the menu, then you have to order at the counter and your food is delivered. No a problem, except you have to pay and leave tip on your card before you eat, which would also be fine if the food and service are good.   At the counter, there are 4 bowls of various after-dinner fennel seeds, with plastic spoons for scooping.  While we were waiting for our food, I observed an employee standing at the counter sticking her naked, uncleaned hand in, grabbing fennel seeds, eating them, then repeating...multiple times. I did not try them upon leaving...  The samosa was average, consisting of just seasoned potato, and you receive 2 in an order. I find it odd that they use plastic takeout containers for the mint and tamarind chutneys, and only give you about a Tablespoon of each for 2 larger samosa.   The gobi manchuruan was quite tasty, but for $6, I expected more than a small side plate.  The butter chicken was terrible. It was $10.99 can consisted of a small bowl filled with an insanely thick, pasty tomato sauce with a few very small chunks of chicken. It was like eating undiluted condensed tomato basil soup. I asked about it and was told it's glue-like cause of the cashews. They took it back and brought it back out with a liquid sauce.   There also appears to be a lot of unnecessary plastic and styrofoam use/waste.  I was just totally disappointed in this highly overpriced place and I will not return. I'm also thoroughly baffled by the 4 star rating they have. I am guessing the banquets have a higher quality food, as seen in the staged photos.",

    "text": "1) Order ahead on the phone or on Yelp/Eat24 if you want to do a pick up. The place gets busy in the evenings and not the most coordinated service you'll find.   2) The food is like any other average Indian restaurant you'll find in town. Nothing special but nothing to bash it for either.   3) It can be a hit or miss with the level of spice.   Note to the new comers to Indian Food - If you cannot tolerate that burning heat in your Indian food, stress that when ordering food. Remember, \"spicy\" is not always indicative of the \"heat\" in your food. Many people make this mistake, as these terms are used interchangeably, confusing things further. Remember, the heat in Indian food is mainly due to addition of fresh green chili, red chili powder or flakes, ground black pepper, and sometimes ginger. Asking the chef to skip only the first two items won't make the food less delicious. Your food will instead be mild, still tasty, and won't burn your insides or give you acidity/heartburn if you are prone to it.   4) Samosa chat (a bit on the hot side), dosas, butter chicken, breads, and \"biryani\" rice are my favorites from this place. EDIT: Butter chicken is EXCELLENT.   5) The place is kind of expensive for the amount of food you get.",

I ordered the lamb spiced level 2 which was plenty for me, and my coworker ordered goat curry level 6, and it was hotter than hell for her lol.  She was sweating with the heat but she loved it. What a sight to see, I must say! The garlic naan is spectacular and is highly recommend trying it with your food. I also ordered chicken tikki masala to go level 2 and it was so good! I will definitely return again!",

I really don't eat Indian food, so I asked the girl at the counter what's good and she told me she doesn't eat there so she didn't know lol. I thought that was a strange response!  We ordered the Mirchi as an appetizer and it was so delicious!!! My fiend ordered some kind of potato pancake with vegetables in it and she loved it. I had a bite and wished I would have ordered that too! I got the lamb wrap and wasn't a fan. The lamb was red. Not red as in bloody and rare, just red. It freaked me out a little bit. I've never seen bright red lamb before.  I should also note that Cafe Delhi is BYOB and they don't charge a corking fee!  If you like Indian food, you should check this place out.",

The restaurant itself can get busy during expected hours of service (lunch and dinner) so if you want it fast, order ahead and carry out. They do have a period of time that they are closed during the day, I believe from about 4:30-5:30pm, so that is something to be mindful of when planning a visit.   My favorite dish is the Malai Kofta with rice AND naan. You can't go wrong with their naan. It's so soft and buttery and everything I need. This dish is a nice balance of savory and sweet and is exceptionally filling. The Palak Paneer and Paneer Tikka Masala are also exceptional plates as well. As a vegetarian, I enjoy the robust options to select from. As others have noted, if you don't enjoy super spicy foods, stick with a 3 or 4 level. I've never braved anything more than this just because I am a creature of habit and stick with what I know.",

When asked to speak to the manager - I was told to write a review on Yelp (No Joke)!!",

I could make a meal on that alone!  My family and I came here and ordered quite a few things for lunch.  Standouts were the cut mirchi, Gobhi Manchurian, fried rice, and pani puri.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala for my entree, and while it was good I felt it was extremely creamy.  I was hoping of more of a tomato based taste.  I think it would have tasted a lot better without the cream, or at least less of it.  My family and I stuffed ourselves to the bone, and ended up not eating dinner that night at all.  I will definitely be back, and might even consider them to cater an event.  Worth the trip to Carnegie!",

I might not go out of my way to go here, but it's convenient for me, affordable (especially lunch), and take out is always fast (I rarely ever eat in here). Lunch is the best deal. I enjoyed the Malai Kofta but was disappointed that there were only two dumplings; my other standby Channa Masala is always good. Naan seems to be kind of variable, but not sure how much of that is a factor of getting it to go.",

The restaurant was busy which seemed like a good sign. Unfortunately, the service and the food were sub-par. Wrong dishes delivered to the table, ordered dishes forgotten... could the nightmare end soon! If you are in the Pittsburgh area and have the urge to have Indian food, please buy packaged stuff and have it at home. However, if you cant resist the urge to visit this place, dont forget to bring your own booze as it is BYOB. Something to lift your spirits up!",

I placed the order at 8pm and they said my order would be ready in 20mins.and after 20mins my order was not ready & the staff kept me waiting for more 30mins.I kept on asking the staff about my order they just ignored and did not reply.After a while i got furious & told them i  wanted my money back as i cannot wait any longer they refused to refund me and they were rude, the manager did not care he kept on telling me to wait 2minutes every time i asked him about my order.After waiting for 30mins i finally got my order. We were so disappointed with their poor service.But we thought the nightmare is over & we can enjoy the food,but we were wrong.we ordered butter chicken & chicken lollipop,the butter chicken was disgusting there was 5pcs of small chicken cubes with creamy sauce with no flavour tasted nothing like butter chicken.The chicken lollipop was cold & i asked them to give me a side of garlic sauce which they did not.I felt cheated & was so angry after the experience i had. I will never go back to this restaurant.& would not recommend this place to anybody.  My husband and I have decided never to visit this place again, rather explore newer an better Indian restaurants.",

Good amount of food, ordered a level 6 and it was perfectly spicy for my tastes...just the right amount of spice to make me sniffle! My bf ordered the chicken Chettinad. His was yummy. Had a bit of coconut milk, just enough to taste it, not overly sweet. We also had the chili chicken appetizer, which is almost like an indian General Tso's. Two entrees, appetizer, mango lassi, all for $25. Great meals for a reasonable price.  This is now my go-to Indian restaurant.    On a side note, I asked one of the staff what time they closed.  She said its supposed to be 9:30, but if they aren't busy, they close earlier, around 8 or 8:30.  So if you are expecting them to be open for a late night meal, you probably should call first before you make the trip!",

Their concept breaks the typical Indian restaurant mold. Fast food, tea, coffee, Indian specialty beverages and tapas at reasonable prices! The menu is simple with recognizable Indian dishes as well as some new ones. This place is meant for snacking and take out.   I ordered two popular Indian snacks, Pani Puri and Papdi chaat. Pani puri (fry bread with water - literally) consists of little puffs of fried crispy dough filled with spiced potatoes and cilantro chutney. They come with a small pouring bowl filled with spicy savory water that's slightly chilled. The perfect way to eat them is to fill your golden crisp puff with the water and pop it in your mouth before the water spills out. Eating it without making a mess is an art to be mastered! Cafe Delhi's pani puri and Papdi chaat were fresh and tasty. I loved every bite - it was the perfect wrap up for a busy week. Steven ordered his Indian staple, Paneer Tikka Masala with Naan. The masala base was creamy and spicy with green peppers and onions. The Paneer rightfully was the True star of this dish. Soft and succulent, this Paneer was melt in your mouth good - a 9.5 on the yumm factor.  I enjoyed my first adventure at Cafe Delhi and am already planning the next one!",
