The most annoying thing is the language barrier, at least it was for my table, but the service was friendly non-the-less. This place is nothing special, it is typical mall food only a wee bit fancier. It'll do in a pinch.",

    "text": "Well, another Japanese Hibachi steakhouse,  They just keep popping up like rabbits.  Wow, don't we have enough of these in the area.  They must be popular.  Very nice atmosphere.  Dark with some blue accent lighting.   Seems a little more upscale then some of the others, but that is probably just the lighting and because it is so new.  This restaurant is actually in the corner of the mall with an outside entrance next to Macy's, a little hard to find if you do not know where it is.  As the name says, there is a sushi bar, hibachi tables, some regular tables and a bar area.     Service was real good.  Place was not crowded, probably due to just being open about 1 week.    The food was good.  I chose the Tempura.  The veggies and Shrimp were cooked just right.   The sushi looked good and the people eating sushi enjoyed it.  The salad that come with the meal was the typical Japanese steakhouse salad, but it was prepared earlier and kept in the cooler, which can be OK, but the lettuce was to cold and almost frozen.   I thought the prices were just a little lower than some of the other Hibachi places.",

It is not in the top 3 best sushi ive had and would not pay more for it but due to its location in the mall its definitely the best choice for a quick lunch that is not fast food from the food court. I have not tried their hibachi.",

    "text": "Went for a relatives birthday dinner. I've been to several hibachi  style restaurants over the years, and normally enjoy them, so my review may be somewhat skewed in favor of this type of restaurant.    The vibe of the place is unique.  The front bar area has a decidedly club feel.  Dark Blue lighting and club music.  I sat at the bar for a while as I waited for my party to arrive and was thrown off by the venue.  The bartender was an attractive female but probably the least friendly bartender I've encountered as far as engaging in conversation.  I tried to start up something but couldn't get anything going.  So essentially I wouldn't recommend this place as a venue to grab a drink.   Once in the dining area the restaurant is nicer.  While it is dimly lit, the decor is much nicer than I expected for a place in the mall.    I got the shrimp and lobster.  I enjoyed my meal although the lobster wasnt the best I've ever had, but then again, I wasnt paying top dollar for high end lobster.    The chef was great.  Very entertaining and skilled.  He was also a big fan of squirting sake into patrons mouths with a squirt bottle.    It ended up being a good time and I enjoyed the place.  We had a coupon that was from the Clipper magazine for 10% off, so keep your eyes peeled for those.",

My girlfriend and I went for the sushi, since we weren't really feeling hibachi at the time.  Our waiter seemed awkward, kind of like it was his first day on the job or something, but it was OK because he didn't bother us too much by coming around every other minute.  We both ordered the lunch special, which was a salad or miso soup and the choice of two rolls for $8 or three rolls for $11. All together we ordered a California roll, a spicy tuna roll, and two tuna and avocado rolls. The spicy tuna, was by far the best. The tuna was fried or something, but its warm nature accented the sushi amazingly. We loved it. The other rolls were average, and nothing great.  Overall, it was a decent lunch for two under $25.00.",

I was thoroughly impressed.  After the initial wait, our service was wonderful and very responsive to our needs.    The sushi tasted great and was fresh.

    "text": "Okay I have to update my earlier review went there yesterday for my birthday which my family has made a tradition for everyone's birthday to say the least this may be our last time there our waiter mike was nice a little slow in the beginning but became a very good waiter the cook Charlie seem to have a small problem with his waiter Charlie refused to perform for us all he did was come throw the food on the hibachi grill no flare no performance no nothing. We asked him why he was going so fast he mumbled something in Japanese and continued cooking my wife got up to go find a manager the manager Linda at first said Oh I remember you you complained before my wife has never complained at this restaurant before and was very upset about this she told the manager no I haven't and told her what was going on the manager's response was oh I don't have much to do with him I'll let the owner know. The manager then stood in the doorway and watch Charlie do nothing extraordinary in fact do nothing at all other than cook she then came over to our table and offered us $20 off of our meal we told her we had three separate parties that met us there for my birthday meal she then proceeded to offer 15 percent off of everyone's check this on top of them not having any soft drinks because of their co2 cartridge ran out no lemonade for the children all they could offer the children was basically water o.r iced tea this restaurant sure has went downhill. In talking to our waiter it seems that Charlie has a problem with him and us to see him quite frequently this was also confirmed by the manager who had pulled Charlie aside and told him that his actions were unacceptable and he had told h her that he was not performing for table for that waiter to me this is insubordination he should have been sent home but instead he went to wait on another table and wow it was a great performance the waiter mike was very professional about all this basically telling us he doesn't know why he does this he says Charlie gets in his  well Charlie's mood is cost this restaurant at least 9 customers that come back at least monthly if not weekly my advice stay away or ask for someone other than Charlie he used to be our favorite but that has ended the manager and waiter told us we could contact the owner directly via the website which I did I am eagerly waiting for a call back but do not think I will get one",

The presentation of our food was lovely. We both got salads with ginger dressing and they were probably about standard as far as salads with ginger dressing go. The ginger dressing however was a bit  on the sweeter side, and a little bit creamier than most, but still good.  Sushi was not outstanding but not terrible. I recommend the sweetheart roll which is remotely similar to spicy tuna roll, but the sushi is rolled and cut to resemble a heart. Overall, enjoyed my sushi(as always), but have had better.  Will have to go back someday and try their hibachi and other entrees.",

I have been to many hibachi restaurants and I must say the gentleman who prepared our food was the most entertaining one I have ever experienced. My daughter and the rest of the kids really enjoyed the show. The birthday celebration at the end of the meal is outstanding. They turn on music, a disco light and bring out a dessert complete with a firework style candle. Unfortunately that is the only reason I was able to give it 2 stars.  I can only describe the food in one way - SALTY.  The fried rice was salty, the noodles were salty, everything I had  with the exception of my salad was salty. I understand the use of soy sauce, but this was sodium overload. My mother had commented to me while we were waiting for our food that none of the 10 or so people across from us were eating any of their food. I thought it was because they were full but I guess I was wrong. The reason I was so disappointed was because the show and atmosphere was so outstanding that if the food had been better I would have given it 4.5 stars. They need to go to Nakama and find out how they prepare their food and replicate it. If not I don't don't think they will be around too long.",

However, after I sat down I was overwhelmed by the smell of old, stale bleach and the table was sticky. But after walking around the mall with an intense sushi craving, I let it go and looked at the menu with an open mind.  First of all the lunch specials are not honored on the weekends, which even confused my waiter. So I went with an eel maki roll (cooked) with cucumber and avocado with a salad & ginger dressing on the side. The rolls were ok, kind of on the warm side.

I was excited to see a trio of spicy salmon, tuna and yellowtail offered. I didn't understand the server when she explained it, and thought it came with around 9 pieces, but it was actually 18 pieces! Imagine my surprise at the feast in front of me!   I didn't mind the tuna, and the yellowtail was the best, but something was off with the salmon and I only had one bite. I realize I'm eating fish, and raw fish at that, but it was a little too strong in the fishy taste, that makes me think it maybe wasn't the freshest.   I did love that the special came with soup and a salad for a grand total of $17...  I love me some ginger dressing! The dressing was good, albeit a little watery. I was not a fan of the miso soup. It just lacked flavor.  Obviously I didn't try the habachi, and I wouldn't be opposed to trying it another time, but the sushi, I'd maybe skip or try the maki instead.",

I did not want mall court food, and wasn't in the mood for Red Robin or BJ's.. then I remembered.. there's hibachi in this mall! Of course, I have had hibachi before, but never at this location. We were sat right away and we both ordered the chicken hibachi dinners. The salads were a little small, but still very delicious- that dressing is incredible. The soup was more like broth, but it was good! The cook was really funny & put on an amazing cooking show for us. We were both laughing & really got a kick out of him. I was surprised to see our meal came with fried rice AND noodles- pretty awesome! The veggies were incredible, the chicken was tasty & the shrimp was SO good. The yum yum sauce & ginger sauce were tasty as well. Our server was really friendly & the manager came to our table after the meal to thank us for stopping by and to ask about our experience. I was overall really satisfied & happy with our meals- we have enough leftovers for two more meals! We had a great experience!",

    "text": "My daughter has experienced two different Saga locations, we happened to stop at this one after a day of mall shopping. The atmosphere is dark, more trendy, and not warm, and welcoming as I've experienced in other Japanese restaurants. We sat at a booth with upholstery that looked as if Freddy Krueger had sat there. We started off with the Rock N Shrimp, presentation was nice, but shrimp were cold. My daughter ordered the Beef Teriyaki, and I chose the Shrimp Soba. Presentation was okay, and my daughter enjoyed her Beef Teriyaki, my Shrimp Soba left me disappointed. I couldn't get over the feeling of eating a bowl of ramen noodles with shrimp and vegetables. Not the thicker buckwheat soba noodles I was expecting. Flavor was non existent in my dish, and if I had known, I would've requested some Sriacha or other sauce.  At the beginning of our meal, we were brought out two bowls of a clear miso soup, and a small iceberg lettuce salad with a Thousand Islandesque dressing. Both were nice, but bland. Perhaps my taste buds are spoiled by other more flavorful Asian foods, and not used to the 'clean' taste of Japanese style foods. Or maybe, Saga just doesn't cut it with great food to begin with, and I was expecting too much. Service was efficient, and friendly though.",

I always sit in the sushi bar area of these places, because I don't go in for magic knife tricks, cooking Asian cuisine with butter, or paying $20.00 a plate for low grade Chinese takeout. I love sushi. Ok, you got me. I think Hibachi is stupid. However it does serve a purpose for people that are afraid to explore cuisine from other cultures unless it is served in a Disney ride setting. Long story short I can't speak for the sushi. Never did see a waitress.  I finished my beer and left.",

It was plated beautifully topped with avocado and tri-color tabiko, it was super fresh and melted in mu mouth.YOU HAVE TO TRY THE SEX SALMON IT IS MORE THAN AMAZING. We also ordered the crab Rangoon....they came out piping hot and they didnt skimp out on the fulling it was so so good my boyfriend jist kept burninf his mouth because he couldnt stop eating them. I ordered that fantastic roll and can see why they call it fantastic and a monroville roll which HAS everything if you like raw. My boyfriend tried and like both and hes not big not sushi. He ordered the steak and scallop hibachi.....i wanted to steal all the scallops they were cooked to perfection and so was the steak..... Both melted like butter in your mouth.

    "text": "I thought heavily about whether or not I should write a review for Saga. Typically, chain restaurants such as this, have plenty of reviews for people to choose from. However, I thought I should.  I wanted to take my family out to dinner. My entire family. Which meant, my four children, their significant others, and my four grandchildren. Yes. I realize that's quite a brood and the amount of a meal at Saga would probably be the same as a small vacation for myself. By the way, that was the decision. I was either going to go down to Wheeling Island, or take my family out, so I opted for the latter.  We were shy one person so there were only 12 of us. We fit nicely at the big table. The one problem I have with Saga and other restaurants like it, is they won't seat you until your entire party arrives. To me this is silly, I would like to have a drink and started ordering sushi so when my party arrived a few minutes late, they could've just sat right down. However, rules are rules. And we were seated at 8:20 when a reservation was for 815. Actually the table was waiting for us.  Let's start with first impressions. The hostess. While she was not negative, she was not personable. She was there to do her job and that's what she did. She would get a neutral rating of a three.  Our waitress was efficient. She moved quickly, she got all of the drink orders correctly, although I could not gauge a personality, she wasn't overly upbeat, but she was pleasant and she was a very good waitress. When she carried that tray of soup and salad, I was impressed and that tray was bigger than her. I would give her a four.  Aw, the chef, he was quite the newbie. I say this because he didn't understand the waitress' writing, or what we meant by child's meal. He was very good. Downside, he had no joking around skills, he kept missing everybody's mouth while putting in the sake, he didn't perform brilliant defeats of culinary acts, and he lit my pink sauce on fire by accident. Or, rather the serving dishes were aflame. Thank goodness my oldest son was there to crack the jokes and we all laughed and had a great time. However, whatever the chef lacked an outgoing personality he made up for in food. The best, juiciest, tastiest, food I have had at Saga yet. I used to eat there a lot. And this was the best. Steak melted in your mouth, he cooked up to perfection. The scallops he did not cutthem into little pieces like other chefs, he left them whole and they were not dry at all. In fact I gave one to my toddler grandson who proceeded to gum the scallop because it was so juicy and tender. I would give the chef, a five-star rating simply because he knew how to cook. Who needs a personality. There were 12 of us. We were our own entertainment  I try something new, if you have never tried it you must do to Tuna takaki, it was amazing. We had a round of appetizers before dinner started as well. All in all I was very pleased with my experience Saga, they know what they're doing there. I had stopped going because my last experience the food was bland. After last night, I'm willing to give it yet another try. On the bright side. Wheeling Island would've been more expensive. I made the right choice.",

I came here a couple of times but kept telling myself to give it another change. Needles to say, this restaurant stinks. We came here on a Tuesday night since we were around the area and I was in a mood for sushi. According to them, it's up to 50% off overpriced sushi. I ordered three rolls: tuna roll, shrimp tempura and yellow tail. We also ordered an udon soup. The sushi came out first. These were the SMALLEST sushi rolls that I've ever gotten. I finished all three rolls before my friend's udon came out. I usually have two rolls and I'm good but I was still so hungry after this. Like I mentioned their rolls were extremely small. The udon came out later and it was awkward as i was done eating and my friend was just starting.  The waiter barely came to attend to us and I had to flag him down to get our check. I was extremely disappointed in the overall experience.  The food tasted bland and it was mediocre.  I will NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone.",

We like to come to the south hills village location on Tuesday for half price sushi night.   However, the servers are usually crap. If I could rate the food higher and the servers lower, I would. But I settled on 3 stars. The fact that some of the servers speak limited english is irrelevant... They are just plain forgetful. I ask for some yum yum sauce.... They come back without it. Remind them two or three times on a not busy week night before it shows up. We had one occasion where I ordered sushi, soup, and rice. Got and ate my sushi and soup and didn't see the waitress again until she delivered the check. I asked her if she would like to bring me the rice I ordered and was charged for. She just giggled and asked if I still wanted it.   Another trip our food was dropped off and she never once checked on us, we had to flag someone else down to get drinks refilled. Something being wrong or forgotten due to a server error has happened almost every trip. Obviously we return because we like the food, but the servers suck.",

My niece wanted to see the hibachi \"show\" and we chose to sit at the hibachi, and not at a table.  We couldn't get the waitress to come to the \"table\" for 20 minutes.  No one explained the menu to us.  We asked if they had a lunch menu and THREE people told us there was no lunch menu, as if we didn't understand the first one, wasting another 10 minutes or so.  As soon as one of our party of five ordered sushi we were asked to move to a table.  However, the party on the other side of the table ordered sushi and were NOT asked to move.  The fork was dirty.  The spoon that came in the soup was sticky, and the soup was only tepid at most.  The three of us who ate the sushi were not feeling well later that evening.  We will NEVER eat there again.",

    "text": "Honestly, folks, I rather like Saga. Yes, last weekend consisted of back-to-back Asian dine-out dinners, and just like my experience in Robinson, I found that this Saga satellite is also worthy of patronage.  After FINALLY seeing \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" Kay and I stopped in and had a meal that was stone-solid and done with a flair for the dramatic.   No, we stayed away from the teppenyaki business since we just wanted some quiet.   It's strange how I sometimes \"complain\" that sushi usually tastes about the same whenever and wherever I have it, but it's really the best kind of \"same\" you can get. The Osaka rolls were filled with tuna, avocado, and I forget what else (these aren't on the online menu), and had crispy roe atop them. A mayonnaise-based sauce was smeared all over the plate, and I eagerly dragged each meaty, sweet seafood medallion through it, treating each piece like a pastry or piece of protein candy, relishing their oceanic flavors and juxtaposed textures, both soft and crunchy colliding in my mouth.   Sliced and cooked with amazing precision, the Steak Teriyaki was a gorgeous, glorious medium rare and was served with exquisitely presented fruits and vegetables, including ornately cut oranges.   The atmosphere was as \"nightclubby\" as expected, but being that this was a late Sunday afternoon, there were more families about, and at least one birthday bash was in full effect.  The service was adequate albeit somewhat cold and aloof for most of our meal, our server loosening up a bit by meal's end.   No one can stop them now, Saga's on the loose.  And if you \"got\" the above reference, you are a fan of Canadian AOR and prog-rock and have my deepest sympathies for the current cultural landscape is hostile towards thee.  Hey, I almost ordered a Green River roll, one that would have required a more critically-correct link...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGuK9hBGGyDg%26feature%3Drelated&s=0278f37514217012b848887f5e4fb6cfc1420b8c06a584f4fc15b11939ad4ea0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=GuK9...</a>",

Erin was our bartender and not only was she incredibly friendly and personable, but she paid probably more attention to us that I'd ever received.  For instance, I had mentioned casually that I was interested in a second glass of wine at some point...before happy hour was over she asked my friends if they wanted anything and stated that she'd already put mine in.  It almost felt like Erin was just a friend hanging out with the four of us that was on the opposite side of the bar.  I should also say that the food was brought out very quickly and as always was very good.  Definitely recommend happy hour at saga south hills!!!",

It wasn't supposed to anything special. My family got the salad with their meals but none of them enjoyed the salad dressing. It was pink, creamy and completely drowned the contents of the salad.  As for the Hibachi meals, they were decent. The meats and veggies were cooked well. However, sections of my rice was chewy. If I had paid the dinner price I may had been upset but at lunch it only costs $10.  My family loves crab ragoons. This restaurant had some of the best ragoons we've ever eaten(and we've tried a lot). I think my favorite part of this visit was the company I had. The chef was absolutely hysterical. I will have to go back to see if my good experience was the actual food or just the wonderful company.",

My bestie had the same thing, except hers was steak instead of chicken. The cook was my favorite part. He was very smiley, and the food was soooo good. We came for lunch because we had a groupon. According to the groupon: you get 2 dinner meals of any choice for $25. Of course this was too good to be True. I dont remember what the bill came up to but they claimed that will still owed $25 on our tab. We were confused because we believed we were getting a 2 for $25 to say the least. The manager informed us that the groupon takes off $25 from the tab but you had to pay the remainder. Long story short, if you ever go here, please don't get a groupon.",

    "text": "To profess anything other than True appreciation for the men's bathroom at Saga would be an outright injustice to love. After enjoying a lovely hibachi meal and an Alaskan sushi roll as well as some delicious sake I made my way through the bar area feeling worn down by the hefty amount of food slowly being broken down by the miracle that is gastrointestinal metabolization.   I will be honest, I was still reeling in the pain of deception incurred by a previous steamy affair with a restaurant known as Benihana where the restroom had an eerie similarity to what I imagine a Turkish prison would be like. But alas, the resilience of the human heart knows no bounds and that I am certain of because when I crossed the threshold I felt a warmth (approximately 75 F) take over my body and I knew in that moment that I was capable of opening myself up once more to trusting Japanese restaurant men's rooms.  The urinals were sparkling. The stained glass window on the door made me feel at peace. There was even a little plant on the sink which seemed placed there through divine intervention as a symbol of growth and hope. The water pressure was splendid. The perfect temperature as well.  My only suggestion would be for management to explore the idea of adding a bidet. This is a truly remarkable establishment and I would just like to thank you for taking pride in the cleanliness of your facilities and providing me with a renewed understanding of what love really is.  Arigato.",

The sushi was excellent but the hibachi left something to be desired. The yum yum sauce wasn't yummy and the rice wasn't sushi grade - the miso tasted incredibly fishier than I'm used to.

I went twice last week because I just couldn't get enough. On the first visit, I had a selection of sushi and seaweed salad, and on the second, I had a kitchen entree in the dining area (not hibachi station).  The Y2K roll is just divine. It has tempura shrimp (the shrimp was fresh, crunchy, and still warm when the roll arrived to me), minced spicy tuna on top, and it's drizzled in eel sauce. It is just so so good.   The spicy California roll is the freshest tasting sushi roll I've ever had, and the spicy sauce on top is out of this world.  The seaweed salad is also the freshest-tasting seaweed salad I have had, and it is not completely drenched in sesame oil as some can be.  I got a rather large portion of it (about the portion of a standard side salad).   The Shogun Chicken meal comes with clear soup AND a side salad with awesome ginger dressing, with a side of white rice as well. The chicken is supposed to mimic general tso's chicken; it was a bit different and not as spicy, but delicious nonetheless and a very large portion size. I decided to upcharge my rice to fried rice, whose portion is also a bit larger, and I ate the entire dish of rice, forgetting about the chicken entirely. Whoops. :)  Don't write this restaurant off just because it's in a shopping mall. The decor is beautiful, the happy hour is great, the employees are very friendly and very much on top of things, and the price is not bad for how much food and freshness you get in your meal. Also, no need to visit the hibachi; I think it's a bit weird unless it's a special occasion, as all items are available in the dining room and taste just as hot and fresh off the flat-top.",

Tempura is really good, I need to try the hibachi sometime. Cons: as you can see, the regular sushi ($3 for 1 roll 6 pieces) is a little small, but reasonable for the price.

Saga doesn't offer its lunch menu on Sunday, so I paid $100 for three of us to eat subpar food.   The meal was bad from the start. The sesame dressing is off...just not like it should be, and not good. The hibachi meal was really bad though. It didn't occur to us until after we had ordered that they didn't ask my sons how they wanted their steaks done.  The reason was soon clear.  Despite charging dinner prices, the lunch is pre-made. My shrimp was cooked, but cold. The boys' steaks were a tepid medium-well.  The rice and noodles were way too salty, and the noodles were actually cold. The cooked vegetables were wilted and sad looking.   This place is phoning it in. Spend your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "By far the worst hibachi I've ever had. I ordered the hibachi lobster and it was literally inedible. I thought they may have over-cooked it so I told them it was too chewy to even eat so they made me another one. It had the same problem. It was so chewy and stringy that I could not even chew it up enough to eat it. I did not even ask for a refund. I literally spit it out on my plate in front of the chef and waitress, asked for my check, and paid without even bothering to take any food home with me. You could not even pay me to eat at this place again. I've never had hibachi this disgusting from anywhere in my life. It would really blow my mind to meet anybody that actually considers this good food. Terrible.",

The tricks are nice to watch with family or friends. Everything is so salty and I didn't like the meat. This is Asian food \"Americanized\". I don't recommend this place at all. Sorry!",

We got sat with another group and we were highly entertained by our chef. He was very engaging and entertaining! My girlfriend even ordered the scallop hibachi .... and she loved it. Our server was so nice and prompt and our cocktails were cold and came right after we ordered . We will definitely be coming back! From start to finish everything was perfect!!",

We sat in the back dining room and the staff were walking around swearing at each other. I mean they were using the 'F\" word. It was terrible. The server disappeared for a half an hr no one could find her. I spoke to the manager and all she said was im sorry. This was probably the most disappointing experience I've ever had.   Update i wrote an email to the company about the staff swearing in front of guests and i havent heard anything back from them. Not as much as a sorry. Ill never spend my hard earned money their again.",

    "text": "Came here with my friend while scoping out the Mall. She's an avid hibachi fan and I hadn't had any in a longer period of time.   We came and sat as the first two at the communal table, which we sat at alone and empty for about 20 minutes before it filled up. Naturally this is not the restaurants' fault, however the waitress who was also serving filled-up adjacent table, took a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and ask for our drinks. She came back immediate asking for our menu items as if to start the process, but then seated the remainder of the table and started the process all over again. Oh well.  The when soup and salad came as an appetizers, my friend ask specifically for no salad dressing which naturally was ignored. Meh. The chef came to cook he tried his best to do the over-the-top presentation that is expected of Hibachi, but seemed, personality wise, to either be new at it or awkward. He didn't engage with anybody until he did a party trick and then reverted back into his shell. Poor kid as he had a very heavy accent.   This locations gives you half noodle and half rice rather than just rice, which was interested/a nice change, but the quality/proportion of them was all off. The fried rice needed another half an egg, the noodles were half crispy half not, the vegetables was practically all onion [sigh - no broccoli] and dude, what did they do with the yum yum and teriyaki sauces? somebody needs to revisit their recipe or at least buy the good brand because it was practically just mayo with some coloring.   Sigh it was a tad disappointing but we came on a Tuesday so it may have just been an off day, not the usual saga experience.",

Have not been able to order anything other than Lobster and steak on the Hibachi.  Can't get any better than that.  IS excellent, as is the chef and staff.   Especially enjoy being sprayed by the bottle of Saki.",
