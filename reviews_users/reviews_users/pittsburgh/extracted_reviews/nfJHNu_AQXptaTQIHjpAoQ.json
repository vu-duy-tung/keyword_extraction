I did not like that after we got seated it took almost 15 minutes before we got a server so that we could place an order for drinks/food. After ordering the food, server came back and said that the ribs I ordered would be ready in about 25 minutes, and wondered if I wanted to order something else, but I told her I did not have any problem with the wait. Rest of the party decided to have their food brought out when I got my ribs. Got free appetizer for the inconvenience. Ribs I ordered was nothing to write home about. I will stick to steak in the future. Rest of party had Flo's filets, and they were very happy with their food. When I got my water refilled, she gave me soda water instead, which was disgusting. All in all a bad experience. Been at this location before, and never had an issue. I will give them a second chance, but chain restaurants are not the best bet.",

    "text": "Our friends got us a gift card to Longhorn and we've been putting off stopping at one.  We were in the Robinson area and thought it'd be a nice treat; steaks and fixin's not too difficult right?  Right, but very average for the price. We waited for about 20 minutes, but our waitress was prompt and nice.  She kept the my iced tea refills coming and was cordial, again just a bit above average though.  We got small steaks which were cooked the way we wanted them, but their flavor wasn't anything special, again just average.   In the end Longhorn is just another chain restaurant that will never wow the likes of me.  It's okay enough, but in my opinion definitely not worth their prices.   Cook a steak at home and grab a bottle or two of cab sav.",

    "text": "Start with the good news:  The Watermelon Salad with grilled chicken was very good. It's a \"summer season special\" and was attractive, tasty and well priced. I'd recommend it highly.  The rest of the visit:  I sat at the bar, which I typically avoid, and waited almost 5 minutes before the bartender, Anne B. approached for my drink order. My place at the bar wasn't ready for a guest: peanut shells, dirty glass from a previous guest, paper from a straw. She returned with my drink and a menu (left it on the bar upside down) and walked away without comment. Bright spot: Anne was able to accurately describe the dressing. While the bartender left the bar for a short while (potty break I guess?) Adrian approached my place and quickly recognized the clutter. He was very pleasant and conversant and was, without question, the best staff member I encountered.   The delivery of my entree was also interesting...kinda slid in from the side by a server who made no comment at all. Very weird. Nevertheless, the food was good as mentioned above.   Bartender dropped the check (also \"wrong side up\"), picked up my card (both without comment and never asked about dessert). I left wishing Adrian would have been my server for the entire meal. By the way, two separate couples left seats adjacent to me without being served. And, an area of the bar (some sort of low seating) was a mess with old newspaper, paper and rags. The remainder of the restaurant appeared to be clean. Terrific food which was \"diluted\" by really poor service...an obvious result of poor training/follow up. Please don't make my mistake and sit at this restaurant's bar but do try the Watermelon Salad!",

Here's my advice if you want a good time here...  When you get in place you reservation for how many people. If you have say two or four then try to find a spot at the bar to sit and wait. This really makes the time fly by. If bigger go outside and wait. You'll be miserable sitting in their little waiting area.   When you sit down order steak! It's a steakhouse so let them feed you what they serve best. If you're a drinker order a short glass of beer. It's cold but I feel their tall beers I can never finish because they get warm. Bread is excellent and sides are delicious. Steak is always phenomenal.   I think people come here expecting a fancy top notch steakhouse but you can't expect that from here. But I am very pleased, and full when I got there.",

Thankfully, the wait was only about 15 minutes, and we had seats to sit in until then. We were seated at a low table, which we liked, but it was near the bar, which we did not like. Nonetheless, we were able to mentally block out the crowds of people who were in the bar. The waitress was nice, took our order promptly, and brought out our food and drink refills at good times. The Flo Filets were cooked as we requested, and they tasted good. I was very surprised that my \"side\" salad was so large and cheap, and it was tasty. The price for the entire meal was not bad either, at least compared to fancy steakhouses.",

    "text": "Eh, I'm going 3 stars, and that's it. Our bill for 2 people was almost $73 before the tip! However, the food was just competent, and for what we paid I feel that it should have been better.   Long Horn appears to be the weak partner so far in the cowboy steakhouse triumvirate that includes Texas Roadhouse and Lone Star (haven't been to one yet). I mean, again, it was all pretty good. I really couldn't bag on the Lobster Shrimp Dip with its mozzarella/gouda blend. My 7 ounce Flo's Filet was adequately tender but didn't have enough of a  wallop in terms of flavor. The Crab Fondue that came as a side was kind of innovative I guess, coming off as a Crab Au Gratin with bread cubes on a wooden skewer for dipping, but I'm not sure that crab and cheese go well together, unless we're talking about cream cheese of course. The Loaded Baked Potato was as good as they come and had all the usual garnishes. I don't recall much about my salad (we ate here late last week). In trying to reduce my consumption of carbonated beverages, I went with the Long Horn Limeade and found it refreshing albeit a little biting (no it had no booze in it).   Despite gouging us for everything else, the offer a dandy of a dessert deal called The Longhorn Dessert Sampler. For $8 you get 3 full desserts: Chocolate Stampede, Caramel Apple Goldrush, and Mountain Top Cheesecake. Each one of them alone was fit for sharing, and we barely made it through them all. The Chocolate Stampede is just a chunk of cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The Caramel Apple Goldrush is a cross between an apple crisp and Apples Foster. The Mountain Top Cheesecake is a typical yankee-style cheesecake with strawberry puree.   How many words are there for capable?   I'm tired of chains. Yes, many of them are good, excellent even, but hell, I need to get offa this track!  P.S. Our server Abby L. was fun, friendly, very good at her job, and a little nerdy in a cute way.",

The waitress was friendly and got refills regularly for the drinks and bread. Our meal was the Porterhouse for 2 - served exactly as ordered and their steak sauce made right at the table was very tasty.

I had the $8 half chicken and avocado sandwich with the shrimp and lobster chowder.  First the chowder because I ate it first. It was simply awesome. It tasted great, was creamy, and a little kick to it.  It was very hot which was very welcome since it was like 10 outside.  Next I ate the sandwich, which uses a flat bread.  It was very tasty. I especially liked the crunchiness of the edges of the flatbread.    So if you find yourself at Longhorn at lunch, try the 8$ special!",

Everything was good, but lukewarm (I understand the steak being lukewarm due to how it was cooked).   We also had the chocolate stampede for dessert, which is particularly good but also very heavy. It's more like a six-person dessert, not just for two.  The reason for four stars and not five is that I was charged for the wrong steak (I was charged for 11 ounces, not 8) and that our food wasn't hot. I didn't want to sit there another 15 minutes waiting for them to fix the bill, so I just paid the extra and went on my way. We both had gift cards; otherwise, this place would be too expensive for my taste. Especially when all the food wasn't hot enough.",

When it came  I cut into it and blood ran everywhere on my plate. The waitress took it back and a manager brought it out. Not sure what they did to it but this time it was tough and well done. It tasted horrible and even had fat on it.  Only after that did he offer to make a new one. Really? 25 dollars for a terrible tough piece of meat that should be tender tasty being filet mignon. At this point, I just asked to have it removed from my bill and didn't eat. My husband ate his meal swiftly  and we left. It ruined one of our few night's out we ever have together. This has happened to me before and I've just eaten what they revised even though not good. Not this time. Enough is enough. If you are a steak place you should know medium rare from medium well. People shouldn't have to wait till you get it right and eat when their family is done eating. This manager was not very good at customer relations and could have cared less.

The lamb chops over garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach were new to the menu so they were a definite and I had the NY Strip with a baked sweet potato with butter and cinnamon sugar.  We didn't order an appetizer because we wanted dessert.  Ha!  With the side salads and main entrees, there was no room for it!  Everything was cooked just right.  Our waitress, Kate, was nice, friendly, and efficient!!  What an enjoyable way to celebrate the holiday.",

I usually get the (Meat / Salad).    Recently I have been getting the Salmon.  The Salmon has good flavor.   The salad has all the yummy little bits one expects.    It ranges for about $10-15.    It is quick and I am back at work with a full tummy.  I will go back but it is nothing special from other establishments.  Service - always good Food - pretty good but not compared to the local establishments (See Yelper reviews) Price - very reasonable ($10-15 for lunch)",

Like lips on fire hot and spicy. Get them without \"prairie dust\" if you don't like the heat. My standard meal here is chicken fingers and fries. But, the last two times we went I got the Four Cheese Pasta with grilled chicken and loved it! I love the bread they serve, but just wish they'd completely cut it through, I know, first world problems, but we always make a hack job mess of ours!

Thank Goodness the food was Good. (Maybe that's where the Manager was... In the kitchen) I hope so for Dardens sake. I was hungry so No Food Picture. As I said the saving grace was the Steak, cooked just the way I ordered it Medium rare. Salad was crisp, honey bread was nice and warm, tried the NEW Mint, Cucumber Lemonade which was delightful. Here's your Hint John, have them check the restrooms at least 1/2 hourly. It's important!",

On a weekend you should call ahead for seating unless you want to volley for a place at the bar where the bartenders are less than excited to make you a drink.  I think that is why I decided to give them 4 stars.  First impressions are everything.  Right?   Wait staff is pleasant and food was great.  Definitely beats walking over peanut shells and loud amateur country themed singing and dancing at some places with an affordable price.  Definitely the steak is as good as a high end steakhouse.",

    "text": "It's pretty good. As Yelp says, it's \"A-OK.\"    So most are familiar with this large chain, so I'll spare you my description on the basics.   GOOD: - My steaks are cooked properly here!  Medium is good and pink. Thank you.   - My salads are pretty fresh and crisp.   - The bread is always served warm.   - They have call-ahead seating.   NOT SO GREAT: - Some cuts of steak are too fatty. I'm taking leaner cuts like a NY strip. They're just not trimmed right.  - This location is a bit too crowded, like they added a few extra tables or something.   My walk to the washroom required me to wait a minute for a server to take an order between two tables essential in the hallway right be the washrooms. This is odd. I've never seen or experienced this at other Longhorns. I'm pretty sure they squeezed in an extra table in the hall.   What do physically challenged diners do?  No way could a wheelchair fit. No way.   - My server this last visit was friendly but frantic, almost shamming dishes onto the table.  But this is just one server.   - They sometimes seat families with kids in the bar, where sauced up patrons curse at full-Pittsburgh volume, right in front of little kids.   OVERALL: Overall, it's decent, it's clean, the food is good, and the pricing matches the quality, so it's worth a visit or a return.",

We also had the manager check up on our table twice and she was great and had a wonderful sense of humor! It's so nice to see interactive, happy managers! In addition to the wonderful staff, the food was DELICIOUS. We were all 100% pleased with our selections. Our steaks were done perfectly, and everything came out in a timely fashion.

When we were seated, it was easily 10-15 minutes before our waitress finally got us drinks.  She stopped and said she would be back then disappeared.  When our waitress finally reappeared we ordered everything all at once.  My soup appeared prior to my drink (water).  I had the potato soup (interesting mix) and my wife had a salad.  My oldest had a 8oz sirloin, wife had the 6oz sirloin, I had a 12 oz ribeye and youngest had chicken fingers.  Everything was ok but I was far from blown away. Steak lacked seasoning and the baked potato was small.  They ran out of bread and one point as well which seems odd on a Friday night.  I often wrestle between which is better when deciding between Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse in a pinch.  Definitely room for improvement here.",

    "text": "We only had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Friday night.   There is a bar but it's rather small in size and not much of a waiting area near the door. We ordered the \"Spicy Chicken Bites\" for an appetizer.. they were good.  They were like boneless small chicken wings in a spicy chili sauce.  Fun and perfect portion for two people to share. Renegade Sirloin with Prairie Dust.. 8 oz was good.  It was the perfect size for a meal. I like the menu options but just wish there were more side options.  Loaded baked potato and salad - just boring.  I really wanted the asparagus - which I saw was on the menu as a side when I looked at the menu online but when I inquired about it while ordering was told there was an \"up-charge\" for that??  This visit was lacking but still a good meal.",

Prices run about $20 for a steak. There's an upcharge for the special sides, but the asparagus was delicious!",

The wait staff supplied enough drinks, bread and butter to satisfy all. It was a celebration for 3 birthdays, confirmation, highest honors, anniversary, and an associate degree. We will definitely return!",

    "text": "Dining at this restaurant was a horrible experience. When we arrived we were told there was a thirty to forty minute wait. Our wait was actually just o Dr an hour and fifteen minutes. We we're a party of five, so we understood smaller parties that arrived after us being seated as we waited. But, when a party of six who had arrived about twenty minutes later that we had was seated ahead of us, I asked the hostess why. She said they had called ahead. We were seated with this party in the waiting area and through conversation who this was not True. What was evident though was that they were more richly dressed and would likely be a higher ticket and better tippers.  Our server, Blake was outstanding. However, the unprofessional and rude treatment we we're subjected to when we we're waiting had already tainted our dining experience",

Our server greeted us rather quickly and she was friendly. We ordered our drinks and then an appetizer when she came back with our beverages. Once our appetizer came out we were finally ready to order.   Our food came out in a timely fashion and was cooked perfectly. It was all absolutely delicious! Our server checked in on us a few times, refilling our drinks and making sure we were satisfied.   The kid's menu is great and the activity book is so much more extensive and interactive than other restaurants.   We will be back, in due time. And I am certain we will enjoy our meal, as we always do!",

    "text": "I understand that every restaurant can experience an \"off night\".  Last night was one of those experiences. I have been happy and even pleasantly surprised by this place in the past. But being seated then waiting for over 15 minutes before asking a busperson for help finding a server is beyond the pale. The hostess took our order and said the manager, Billy, would be stopping by to talk with us. Then a server showed up asking for our order and openly complained when we told her it had been taken. Our salads were delivered by a third person and our entrees by a fourth. No one ever introduced themselves, welcomed us to the restaurant, or apologized for the delays. And Billy never showed up. When the check arrived it contained a $5 discount. Like I said at the start, every restaurant experiences an off night, but it's how those nights are handled that makes all the difference. By the way, the food was good as always. Thank goodness.",
